SITES CHALLENGE, BUT DON'T NECESSARILY TOP BCS

   Someone is either defending the process or they're looking for
an alternative to the Bowl Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're looking for a good argument about the computer
system that determines college football's top two teams, try
cyberspace. Scores of amateur Webmasters have set up sites touting
their own rankings or power-rating formulas, and they all put in
their 2 cents on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Billingsley of Nashville, Tenn., who updates his
rankings weekly on the College Football Resource Center (cfrc.com),
said the idea of incorporating computers into the football
championship picture works for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I also recognize that very few computer formulas actually
reflect a purely objective poll,'' Billingsley said. ``A program is
only as good as the programmer.''
</P>
<P>
   Billingsley said the BCS rankings is a nice balance between
polls subjective to emotional and personal input, such as The
Associated Press and the USA Today/ESPN Coaches' Poll, and those
that are objective, such as the computer polls.
</P>
<P>
   But ``I would be absolutely against using only computers to
determine the championship game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Palm, a systems bank analyst in Chicago who operates his
own rankings at CollegeRPI.com, ``prefers'' using computers and a
formula to determine playoff teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of these computer rankings is essentially one man's
opinion,'' he said. ``I think it helps to have some statistical
measure of teams to use at least as a guideline, and the more
opinions, the merrier.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Massey, a Virginia Tech graduate student in Blacksburg,
Va., who ranks teams on his Massey's Ratings and Rankings site
(www.mratings.com), has an interesting spin on the matter. It's one
that, if used by the BCS, would have taken Virginia Tech out of the
Nokia Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Massey said he'd like to see the BCS ratings used as a guide
rather than the rule. A final decision could be vetoed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This might answer some concerns of a cold, hard math formula
in a game full of emotions and circumstances that don't show up in
the numbers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not all amateurs who have their eye on determining playoff
finalists. ISL United States, a marketing group in Norwalk, Ct.,
launched College Football Playoff 2000 (collegefootballplayoff.com)
to solicit support for a $3 billion playoff proposal. Fans can
voice their support with e-mail postcards directed at Division I-A
university presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Fans who support the official line can access the Bowl
Championship Series official site (abccfb.go.com), which is
operated by ABC Sports Online. The site has interactive and
multimedia features and updates.
</P>
<P>
   The unofficial word, of course, is all over the 'Net. David
Wilson of Madison, Wis., recognized the varying opinions and
created a portal (www.cae.wisc.edu/(tilde)dwilson/rsfc/rate).
</P>
<P>
   Massey said he recognizes the healthy debate caused by the BSC.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there may be room for some improvement, the BSC has
worked successfully in its two years of existence,'' he said. ``And
it has been a great topic of discussion for college football
fans.''
</P>
<P>

COWBOYS PUT 5 IN PRO BOWL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Emmitt Smith and Erik Williams made a pledge to
each other during the off-season that they would be back _ together
_ representing the Cowboys in the 2000 Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We committed to each other: `We're going to get back \Rto the
Pro Bowl\S,' '' Smith said yesterday. ``And ... we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Williams, both voted in as reserves in the three-part
balloting of NFL players, coaches and fans (each counting
one-third), will join NFC Pro Bowl starters Larry Allen and Deion
Sanders for the Feb. 6 game in Honolulu. In all, the Cowboys had
five players selected
</P>
<P>
   Outside linebacker Dexter Coakley was the biggest surprise and
evoked the loudest ovation yesterday from the players gathered
around coach Chan Gailey on the field after practice when the
announcement was made.
</P>
<P>
   Coakley, a third-year player/first-time Pro Bowler, goes to
Honolulu as a reserve behind New York Giants' Jessie Armstead and
Tampa Bay's Derrick Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   Coakley, a restricted free agent after this season, has had a
Pro Bowl-type season, but without the Pro Bowl name recognition
that so often seems to be required in all-star selections in any
sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``This lets me know that some effort goes into the choosing,''
Cowboys' Alonzo Spellman said, ``because Dexter definitely deserves
it.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, Coakley is short. He's listed at 5-foot-10, and that
probably (no pun intended) is a bit of a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   When the skeptics questioned the Cowboys for drafting Coakley in
the third round out of tiny Appalachian State in 1997, Larry
Lacewell, the team's scouting guru, countered by saying, ``We're
not bringing the guy in to change light bulbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not? He has done everything else this season.
</P>
<P>
   All four of Coakley's team-leading interceptions from the
weakside linebacker spot have come in national TV games, including
two against Miami's Dan Marino on Thanksgiving Day. Coakley
returned one 46 yards for a touchdown. He cleaned up on all the
NFL's major awards that week.
</P>
<P>
   His other two picks came in prime-time games against Atlanta in
September and New England this month. He ranks second on the team
to Randall Godfrey in tackles with 117 and is second to Charlie
Williams in passes defensed with nine. He also has one sack.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, never in his wildest dreams did Coakley envision himself
headed for Honolulu in six weeks
</P>
<P>
   ``This is huge!'' Coakley said, ``Coming from a small school,
all through my career, you're dealing with the negatives: `He won't
be big enough. He won't be durable enough.' This is great. It
definitely came out of the blue for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is a capsule summary of each of the Cowboys' other Pro
Bowlers for the 2000 game:
</P>
<P>
   Left guard Larry Allen, perennial All-Pro selection for the past
five years at guard or tackle, hasn't played since Nov. 14 when he
suffered a sprained right knee. ``I didn't think I'd make it this
year,'' said Allen, a Pro Bowl starter four years in a row. ``Not
to be out there \Rfive games\S and still make the Pro Bowl shows
the respect that the players have for me. This one means a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Deion Sanders, who led the fan voting at both
cornerback and kick-return specialist, is headed for his eighth Pro
Bowl (fourth in five years with the Cowboys). The NFC kick-return
specialist will be Chicago's Glyn Milburn. Sanders missed the first
two games of the season (toe) and played hurt several more weeks
with hamstring and groin strains. He receives a $1.5 million bonus
by playing 70 percent of the plays ... and making the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Emmitt Smith, with eight Pro Bowls in 10 seasons,
is fourth on the Cowboys' all-time list behind Bob Lilly (11 Pro
Bowls), Mel Renfro (10) and Randy White (9). ``I didn't expect to
make it this year, because over history the top three rushers from
each conference get in,'' said Smith, who ranks fourth among NFC
rushers with 1,165 yards and 10 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought \RPhiladelphia's\S Duce Staley (1,229 and four TDs)
would get in. To be honest, he probably should. But maybe \Rthe
voters\S took into consideration the Minnesota game.'' That night,
Smith had 140 yards rushing through the first 24 minutes before a
broken right hand forced him out of the game. Playing with a metal
plate in his hand now, Smith has missed 10 quarters this season
because of injuries, including a strained groin that shelved him
after the first play against Philadelphia two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis back Marshall Faulk of St. Louis (1,248 yards and six
touchdowns) is the NFC starter. Washington's Stephen Davis
(NFC-leading 1,405 yards and 17 TDs) and Smith will back him up.
</P>
<P>
   Right tackle Erik Williams, a reserve to the St. Louis Rams'
Orlando Pace and the New Orleans Saints' William Roaf, is headed
for Honolulu for the fourth time in a nine-year career. ``I thought
last year would be my comeback year, but apparently no one else saw
it that way,'' Williams said. ``This one makes me feel good because
I've struggled with my \Rright\S knee the past four or five years
since that \ROctober 1994\S car accident. But I know I deserve to
be over there this year. Nobody can tell me any different.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong safety Darren Woodson, who said that he didn't have a
``Pro Bowl year,'' saw his string of consecutive trips to Hawaii
snapped at five.
</P>
<P>
   Cases of Cowboys being snubbed can be made for:
</P>
<P>
   Free safety George Teague, with two interception returns for
touchdowns, who lost out to San Francisco's Lance Schulters and
Philadelphia's Brian Dawkins;
</P>
<P>
   Godfrey, who Coakley was sure would go to the Pro Bowl instead
of him, lost out to Detroit's Stephen Boyd, who will back up
perennial Pro Bowler Hardy Nickerson of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at
middle linebacker;
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Greg Ellis, who led the Cowboys with 7 1/2 sacks
and two long-distance touchdown returns (87-yard interception and
98-yard fumble);
</P>
<P>
   Punter Toby Gowin, who lost out statistically to Minnesota's
Mitch Berger;
</P>
<P>
   Center Mark Stepnoski, who was the people's choice (along with
Woodson, Sanders and Allen) in the fan voting.

STARS' BELFOUR REMAINS AT TOP OF HIS GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Stars backup goalie Manny Fernandez realized playing
on what had quickly become a sore knee wasn't really an option not
too long into practice Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Now, all he had to do was tell usual goalie Ed Belfour that he
would have to play.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe, that knee wasn't so bad after all.
</P>
<P>
   But it was. So Fernandez went to Belfour, who had just played in
back-to-back games a couple of nights before, and explained the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said `I'll go,''' Fernandez said. ``He's fired up. He knows
he's a big spark on this team and a big reason why we're winning.
He wants to take every challenge. He wants to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, Belfour really wasn't even supposed to play in
the second of the back-to-back games. But the Stars were playing in
their first game since losing captain Derian Hatcher for six to
eight weeks with a lacerated calf muscle, and Belfour not only
figured he needed to be in the game, he ``wanted'' to be in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you play back-to-back games, and we'd lost one of our
best players and captain, you want to have as many veteran players
in the lineup as you can,'' Belfour said. ``If I can help out that
way and play a great game, I wanted to try to do that. And I came
up with a good save at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   A good save?
</P>
<P>
   Try an unbelievable save. Stars defenseman Darryl Sydor watched
the replay later and said he doesn't know how Belfour managed to
make the stop. Belfour slid from one side to the other, stacked his
pads, and when he saw the shooter going upstairs, he kicked his top
leg up at the last second, getting the puck with the toe of his
skate.
</P>
<P>
   The whole thing took maybe a second to transpire, a great save
made even better because the Stars were clinging to a 3-2 lead at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he doesn't stop it, it's a tie game,'' Sydor said. ``I
guess that's why Eddie is there to do that kind of stuff. With
Derian being out, he's the big-time closer.''
</P>
<P>
   He looked like Rollie Fingers against Calgary on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour made 31 saves to preserve a scoreless tie, including a
superb stop on Flames forward Jarome Iginla in overtime. Belfour
had one of those nights, and they've been frequent this season,
where he made the amazing look ordinary and impossible look doable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strength of our team that has given us a chance to remain
in the race is goaltenders,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said.
``Both the guys, him and Manny, and I don't want to leave Fernandez
out of this because he's been good too. These guys, every night,
they give us a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour has also given them leadership. He will be in goal again
tonight against the Chicago Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
   Not the rah-rah, locker room-speech-making kind of leadership
that we see so much of today, but the quiet leadership of going out
on the ice every night and doing his job and doing it well even
when those in front of him haven't returned the favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been some frustration on his part in the way we've
played in front of him. I think that we haven't played as well in
front of him this year as we did last year, and we've had to rely
on him a little bit more,'' Hitchcock said. ``I think the
leadership is he's not carrying any burdens with him right now.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour has a reputation for doing otherwise. ``You mean that
he's crusty, he's difficult,'' Stars forward Mike Keane said,
``when really, he's a teddy bear. Maybe, he just thinks he's a
toughie.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not. Just ask Stars forward Jamie Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Wright has been bounced back and forth between the Stars'
minor-league affiliate in Kalamazoo, Mich., and Dallas all season.
Players like him only rent an apartment when told to. Until then,
let's just say, Marriott points begin racking up.
</P>
<P>
   So guess who invited Wright to come and live with him? Yep,
Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had plenty of room,'' Belfour said, adding that Adam
Creighton had done likewise for a young Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   A kinder, gentler Belfour and a Stanley Cup to boot. Many
predicted that to be the kiss of death. What would be his
motivation to play hard every night? What did he have left to
prove?
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing what we did last year, he could've come back this year
and take it easy a little bit. But I think he wants to prove to
everybody that he's the goaltender he was last season,'' Stars
center Guy Carbonneau said. ``Without a doubt, he's been our best
player all year.''
</P>
<P>
   The talk-radio callers who predicted anything less didn't really
know Belfour. Not that a lot of people do, and Fernandez certainly
isn't claiming to have any deep insights. But Fernandez said he
sees a lot of himself in Belfour. They are both those rare
individuals that if all of the money were taken out of the game,
then they would continue to play as hard as they could, because
they can't deal with losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fire that he has I see a lot of me in there, too,''
Fernandez said. ``We're both the same. We refuse to lose. I see
him. He gets fired up before a game.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the parts of Belfour that have remained unchanged
since he arrived in Dallas in July 1997. But he isn't the same
Belfour as then. During Tuesday's practice, the remark was made
that Belfour seemed to be settling into the golden years of his
career. He has a Cup, a new contract and he's finally developing
the reputation for being the goalie he always has been: One of the
best in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   He even looks, dare we say, happy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I've had a lot of success here in Dallas, and I'm happy
about that and fortunate. I'm just trying to continue that
success,'' Belfour said. ``And maybe all the years before that, all
the hard work, maybe not winning the Cup has made me more hungry
over the years, is starting to pay off.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no maybe about it.

SAINTS' DITKA STANDS BY DECISION TO DRAFT WILLIAMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ The Saints' savior, running back Ricky Williams,
sat on the floor of the visitors' locker room curled up in his
cubicle. An empty stool served as a barricade between Williams'
position inside his locker and the rest of the world after the
Saints' 31-8 loss Sunday to the Ravens in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The hood from Williams' parka concealed the emotions and the
distinguished dreadlocks of a 22-year-old who has said he bears
multiple physical and emotional scars from his first NFL season.
The physical problems include injuries to his left ankle, right
elbow and a severe sprain to the big toe on his left foot, an
injury which has prevented Williams from playing the past four
weeks, although he's expected back in the lineup that Saints' coach
Mike Ditka gave up far too much (eight draft picks) to acquire
Williams in last spring's draft _ isn't obvious here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to back off of our decision,'' said Ditka, whose
tenure with the Saints beyond this season appears in jeopardy. ``I
didn't care what people said about it back in April, and I don't
care what they say about it now _ you included. You are not the
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is the authority on what we do but us, and nobody has
to answer for what we do but us. That might sound harsh, but it's a
fact. If I have to answer, I will answer, by God, and it will
probably be in a way that will make everybody happy \Rby getting
fired\S. But right now, we made the right decision on Ricky
Williams.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditka traded the Saints' first-, third-, fourth-, fifth-, sixth-
and seventh-round selections from 1999 and first- and third-round
selections in 2000 to Washington for the Redskins' first-round
selection (fifth overall) to acquire Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism here surrounding Ditka's move is directed not so
much at Williams, who has had a solid season, but at trading away
so many premium draft picks for a team with so many needs.
Williams, even missing most of the past month, has rushed for 816
yards.
</P>
<P>
   As Saints' third-year linebacker Keith Mitchell said, ``Since
I've been here, we haven't had a 600-yard back. So, hey, he's
already made a big difference as far as I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' rushing total is the most for a Saints running back
since Mario Bates rushed for 951 yards in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Ditka remains stoic in the face of his critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life has never been predicated by what \Rothers\S think,''
he said. ``There are people in the league who I have tremendous
respect for. Then, there are people in the league that I really
don't care for _ just like they don't care for me. So, we made a
decision _ not based on what the league thinks and what's best for
the league. We did something we thought was best for the Saints.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, meanwhile, wasn't talking to the media early this
week, although he's expected to address the media today.
</P>
<P>
   Ditka said he expects Williams to get his first extended playing
time in more than a month against the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to play,'' Ditka said. ``We want him to play. No,
he's not 100 percent, but he's probably no worse than when he
played with the ankle injury, so he's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The player chosen one spot ahead of him, running back Edgerrin
James, meanwhile, has had a dream season playing for a team with
the top young quarterback in football, Peyton Manning, and one of
the top young receivers, Marvin Harrison. That trio has helped
Indianapolis to a 12-2 record, already a nine-game improvement over
a year ago. James ranks second in the NFL behind only Marshall
Faulk of St. Louis in rushing (1,400 yards) and total yards from
scrimmage (1,935).
</P>
<P>
   While Williams might suffer by that comparison, he does not lack
supporters, especially in his own locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's the real deal,'' Saints quarterback Billy Joe
Tolliver said. ``I think he's got it all. He's got the size and the
speed, and he's a smart kid on top of everything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``He picked up our system fast. He does the right things. I
think he's going to be a good back for a long time. Everybody talks
about trading your whole draft for a kid, but he'll be a
difference-maker before it's all said and done.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but it won't be this season.

ALGERIAN CHARGED IN EXPLOSIVES CASE

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A five-count federal indictment accusing an Algerian
man of trying to smuggle nitroglycerin and other bomb-making
materials into the United States was as notable for what it didn't
say as what it did.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment, handed down Wednesday, charges Ahmed Ressam with
illegally carrying explosives and with making false statements to
U.S. Customs agents in Port Angeles after he drove off a ferry from
British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no mention in the charges of any broader plot
linking Ressam, 32, to any terrorist network or planned attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a terrorism indictment,'' said U.S. Attorney
Katrina Pflaumer.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam's arrest _ and the arrest of a second Algerian at the
Canadian border in Vermont _ have stirred fears of terrorist
attacks during the holidays and prompted warnings from the State
Department that U.S. citizens abroad may be in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Under heavy security, Ressam was led into the U.S. Courthouse in
Seattle, where he pleaded not guilty to each count.
</P>
<P>
   He listened intently as the proceedings were explained to him in
Arabic through a court translator. Ressam said nothing, except to
indicate that he understood the charges against him and the pleas
he was making.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Diskin told Magistrate John
Weinberg that the materials found in Ressam's rental car _
including nitroglycerin, urea powder and timing devices _ could
``easily have taken down a building'' had they been assembled into
a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg ordered Ressam held without bail after his federal
public defender, Tom Hillier, raised no objection.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the bomb components, Weinberg cited Ressam's
outstanding warrants in Canada for theft charges, his use of a fake
passport and Quebec driver's license, and the fact that he held
plane tickets to leave the United States after an overnight stay in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no conditions that can be set that would ensure his
appearance and the safety of the community,'' Weinberg concluded.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Ressam could face up to 40 years in prison and be
fined more than $1 million. He is being held in the federal
detention center at SeaTac.
</P>
<P>
   His trial was set for Feb. 22 before U.S. District Judge John
Coughenour. Federal prosecutors have to option may to try indicting
him on additional charges if they assemble evidence of a broader
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   After the detention hearing, Pflaumer issued an unusual plea to
anyone who might have been involved in such a plot to come forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now would be an excellent time for (a co-conspirator) to
disassociate himself and come forward,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian investigators say they are searching for a man who
recently shared a motel room with Ressam in Vancouver, B.C.
</P>
<P>
   His hands shaking, Ressam was stopped by U.S. Customs officers
Dec. 14 after he drove off a ferry from Victoria at Port Angeles.
Several forms of false identification, including a passport and two
Canadian driver's licenses, were also found in his car.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam tried to bolt from inspectors, but was stopped after a
five-block foot chase.
</P>
<P>
   Hillier said he has yet to see any of the prosecutors' evidence
against his client. He said Ressam speaks virtually no English,
save the words ``OK'' and ``Coca-Cola.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's holding up,'' Hillier said. ``He's in a foreign country
in difficult circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillier stressed that no one from the U.S. Attorney's Office had
approached him about a plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation in the press that prosecutors may be
forced to offer Ressam a deal to learn more about the targets of
the explosives, and about any terrorist organizations he was
involved with.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported Wednesday that French officials
believe Ressam has links to an Algerian terrorist group responsible
for bombings in France. It also reported that American officials
have unconfirmed intelligence reports that Ressam was seen in
Islamic fundamentalist training camps during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials told The Associated Press they are
searching for as many as three other people who may have ties to
Ressam.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI Wednesday asked the public for help identifying everyone
who traveled on the ferry Coho the day Ressam was arrested.

FISET WAS PRESSED INTO SERVICE

<P>
   SAN JOSE _ If Andy Murray had his way, the Kings coach would
have held goaltender Stephane Fiset out of the team's three brutal
losses last week. Fiset was still coming back from missing five
weeks with an injured right hand.
</P>
<P>
   But with Jamie Storr playing poorly, and later placed on injured
reserve with a concussion, Fiset had no time to work his way back
gradually. One period after he was activated, Storr was pulled.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset allowed three goals against New Jersey and two more
against the New York Rangers the next night. But his toughest
effort came last Saturday at Staples Center when he was replaced
after allowing six goals against Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I need more time? That's a loaded question,'' Fiset said.
``I told the coach I was ready, so I was ready. But you can always
use another practice or two when you're coming back. But there are
no excuses. We all should have been ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiset, the Kings starting goaltender to open the season, allowed
just one goal in the first period Wednesday after a defensive
mix-up by defenseman Aki Berg and Frantisek Kaberle.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good first period is important for all of us, but I think it
will be really important for Steph,'' Murray said. ``It is the best
way to rebuild confidence. You really can't get that back in
practice. He needed the work, but we couldn't get it for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Roster move: After Jozef Stumpel was cleared to play after
missing five weeks (hernia surgery), defenseman Jere Karalahti was
assigned to the Long Beach Ice Dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Karalahti played in just one game after overcoming visa problems
last month in his native Finland. That was Dec. 11 against Montreal
and he was not sharp.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a tough situation for him, conditioning-wise,''
Murray said. ``He was hurt for about a week and a half and when he
came back, the coaches knew he wasn't going to be around much
longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to protect their own interests, but he really hadn't
played much and it showed.''

RETIRED FBI AGENT IS ACCUSED OF CONSPIRING WITH MOBSTERS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 11th graf to add charges against Flemmi and Bulger)  (rk) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A federal grand jury here indicted a retired FBI agent
Wednesday on charges that he conspired in crimes with two reputed
mob leaders who had been longtime FBI informers.
</P>
<P>
   The agent, John J. Connolly Jr., who has denied all wrongdoing,
has been a central figure in a long-playing federal case here
against the reputed mobsters, James Bulger and Stephen J. Flemmi,
that has raised questions about just how much FBI agents protected
their criminal activities. The case has been an embarrassment to
the FBI and could have broad implications for the often-murky
relationships between law-enforcement officials and criminal
informers.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi has testified that one of his FBI handlers (not Connolly)
told him, ``You can do whatever you want, just don't clip
anybody.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Connolly's lawyer, R. Robert Popeo, said Wednesday night that
his client was being prosecuted for doing his duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I characterize this indictment as outrageous,'' Popeo said,
adding that Connolly ``did his job, he did it well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has been embarrassed by the Bulger case,
he said, and ``that's fine but don't change the rules of the road
retroactively.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Connolly pleaded not guilty Wednesday night to charges of
racketeering, obstruction of justice and conspiring to commit
racketeering and obstruction of justice. He was released on
$200,000 bail, Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   The racketeering charge accuses Connolly of taking a series of
gifts and cash from Bulger and Flemmi for his superior, John
Morris, between 1981 and 1987. Morris, who has been granted
immunity, has admitted in court that he took the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   The racketeering charge also involves the FBI's failure to
investigate accusations that Bulger and Flemmi had illegally taken
over a liquor store.
</P>
<P>
   The obstruction of justice charge concerns an accusation that
Connolly, who retired in 1990, tipped off Flemmi in 1988 about an
FBI wiretap and in 1995 about a grand jury indictment that was
about to come down against Flemmi, Bulger and others.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi, who was charged in the indictment with conspiracy and
obstruction of justice, is in prison awaiting trial on other
racketeering charges. Bulger, who was charged on Wednesday with
conspiracy, fled while facing earlier charges and is one of the
FBI's 10 most wanted fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly has maintained that he knew that Bulger and Flemmi,
were no angels, but that he was following accepted procedure and
kept his superiors informed of the criminals' doings.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship with the mobsters began during a period in the
1960s and '70s when the FBI was intent upon crushing La Cosa
Nostra, he has said, and was willing to strike deals with criminals
perceived as lesser threats.
</P>
<P>
   Donald K. Stern, the U.S. attorney here, said Wednesday night
that ``these charges are serious and reflect a corrupt and
long-term relationship between persons in the business of
extortion, bribery and loan-sharking, and an FBI agent who
protected them from prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictments stem from months of investigation by a special
Justice Department task force composed of prosecutors and FBI
agents with no Boston ties.
</P>
<P>
   The practices used in the handling of Bulger and Flemmi, as they
have emerged in federal court here, have been so disturbing that
they spurred a monthslong policy review by the Justice Department
that, officials said this spring, would surely lead to new rules
requiring agents to share more about the relationships with
informers.
</P>
<P>
   Such relationships tend to be so delicate that they are often
agents' most closely guarded secrets _ and can often lead to their
greatest coups. Much has been made of the fact that Connolly and
Bulger came from the same South Boston neighborhood, and that their
personal rapport powerfully bolstered their professional
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly has refused to testify in the federal court case, but
he said in an interview earlier this year that he believed Flemmi
and Bulger should receive immunity for crimes, like loansharking,
that they committed with the government's knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   It was understood, he said, that they could commit crimes, so
long as they were not violent. There was a very basic calculation
at work, he said: ``We were going to use a gang of two to get rid
of a gang of 42.''

NO. 4 CINCINNATI WALLOPS COLD-SHOOTING OKLAHOMA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORMAN, Okla. _ In rolling to its best-ever start under Kelvin
Sampson, Oklahoma defeated respectable opponents like George
Washington, California, Mississippi and Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   But even Sampson said that the No. 21 Sooners had not met a team
with the talent of No. 4 Cincinnati, most recently deposed from
five weeks as the nation's top-ranked team by a two-point loss to
cross-town rival Xavier on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   And after last night's 72-57 loss to the Bearcats (9-1), Sampson
conceded the obvious difference between the two teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been exposed like that and we've played some good
teams,'' Sampson said. ``Cincinnati is a better team than us now.
But I'm not going to overreact to this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Cincinnati's kids needed the Xavier game to get their
focus back. I think our kids needed this game. Our inexperience
showed. But this was a good experience for us. Cincinnati is really
good. And Kenyon Martin is as good as advertised.''
</P>
<P>
   There were a stocking load of reasons why the Bearcats dominated
OU (9-1).
</P>
<P>
   Center Kenyon Martin was only one, but he was almost enough.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-9 senior from Dallas Bryan Adams scored a game-high
23 points on 11-for-13 shooting and pulled down nine rebounds in
only 26 minutes. And had he played longer than six minutes in the
first half because he incurred his second foul six minutes into the
game, Cincinnati might have led more than 39-29.
</P>
<P>
   At that, the Bearcats scored the game's first nine points and
never let OU closer than four. They are 3-0 this season against
ranked teams and have won six consecutive regular-season games
against Top 25 opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was most important that we got off to a good start coming
off a loss and we played good tonight,'' Martin said. ``They've got
to play without me sometime. Tonight I got into foul trouble early
and they adjusted. My hat's off to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we had another half to play and I put the fouls behind
me. I just had that type of night, being ready to shoot and
knocking down shots.''
</P>
<P>
   He hit a variety of shots. And the Sooners had no answer to
Martin, especially when forward Eduardo Najera had his poorest game
of the season. Najera, who was hitting almost 47 percent of his
shots, made only 6-of-21 from the floor. He scored 16 points before
he fouled out with 4:29 to play and Cincinnati leading, 65-50.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played me like every other team,'' Najera said. ``My
shots were not falling, but I can't get caught up in that. I didn't
play good at all and I'm concerned about the team. Even though the
shots were not going in, we still have to play better
defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma's long-distance shooters also had a poor night. The
Sooners had been sinking 3-point shots at a Big 12-best 44.1
percent clip. Last night, they hit only seven of 32. And many of
those were uncontested. OU shot 30 percent overall, 20 percentage
points under its season average.
</P>
<P>
   ``We picked a bad night to not shoot the ball well for sure,''
Sampson said.

   DUBBELDAM-ARCHITECTURE (New York) _ Clients willing to indulge
the futuristic whims of architects are notoriously rare. But Winka

visual poetry: the passion of a former sculptor for combining
natural materials to achieve novel effects. Among her fans, the

early 90s, had retired from active practice and was sitting alone
in his ocean-front duplex, bored. In 1994, after serving on a
review panel for work by Miami architecture students, he had lunch
with a fellow juror, Deborah Desilets, and more lunches. ``He was
so removed from professional life,'' she said. ``I realized that he
had so much to give that it would be a shame not to find some way
to make it happen.'' Eventually they formed an informal
partnership, taking him from deep retirement to shallow retirement.

CELTICS BURY HAWKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Six straight losses taught the Celtics no late-game lead can be
too large. Not the way they play. Not with their recent tendency to
let games slip away with sloppy play. Not when they are plagued
with inopportune breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night at the FleetCenter, there were still breakdowns,
scoring droughts, and mistakes, but no fatal collapse. On the night
the parquet floor was retired, Boston defeated Atlanta in blowout
fashion, 98-81, in front of 15,973.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics, who improved to 11-14, practically guaranteed by
halftime that their losing streak would not stretch into the
holiday break. The effort and positive attitude coach Rick Pitino
often applauded in defeat was finally handsomely rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a win and got off the slide,'' said Kenny Anderson, who
contributed 13 points and 10 assists in the Celtics' unselfish
display. ``We've just got to keep it up. With one game, we can't
get real overjoyed, but we executed, passed the ball well, and
everybody got involved. We played good aggressive defense. We had a
lot of energy. Lately, our problem has been that we cannot close
the door in the fourth quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics set the tone and tempo early, determined not to make
the same mistakes that had cost them victory in Atlanta Nov. 27.
They knew better than to get stuck in a halfcourt game where
Atlanta's leading scorer Isaiah Rider (23.5 points per game) and
the NBA's leading rebounder Dikembe Mutombo (14.6 rebounds per
game) could become factors. The two Hawks showed their ability to
take over games together last month, leading the comeback victory
at the Philips Center.
</P>
<P>
   The game was knotted at 6 when the Celtics went on a 20-6 run
that absorbed eight minutes off the clock. A driving layup by
Adrian Griffin capped the spurt with 33.5 seconds left to play in
the opening frame. A last-second, 22-foot jumper by Dana Barros
allowed the Celtics to double up the Hawks, 28-14, at the end of
the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   By halftime, Boston had pushed its lead to 18 points (50-32) as
scoring spurts expanded and contracted the gap. Atlanta mounted an
8-2 run midway through the second quarter, cutting Boston's lead to
14 points. Then, Antoine Walker made it his personal mission to
gain back lost ground. The forward followed his first 3-pointer
with a slam dunk and returned the Boston lead to 19. After an
Atlanta timeout, Pervis Ellison put back a Walker miss as the
Celtics' lead grew to 21 points.
</P>
<P>
   A 7-1 Atlanta run trimmed the visitors' deficit to 15 points
with 1:06 left to play before a layup and buzzer-beating 3-pointer
by Eric Williams pushed the Celtics lead to 50-32 by intermission.
</P>
<P>
   But Boston knew from experience against Atlanta that no lead was
safe. As the Celtics pushed their lead to the point of
embarrassment in the third quarter, the Hawks played with little
energy or enthusiasm. Boston built its advantage to a game-high
28-points near the end of the third with a pair of Barros free
throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing as two different teams,'' said Atlanta's Bimbo
Coles, who along with LaPhonso Ellis, led the Hawks with 13 points.
``We play well in practice, but we're not taking this to the floor.
We're not playing defense. We have the talent, but that's not
carrying over into the game. We're working hard on our offense, but
we have to use set plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Rider finished with 11 points, marking only the ninth time this
season he has not led his team in scoring. Mutombo recorded a
below-average performance on the glass, grabbing just 13 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Vitaly Potapenko worked tirelessly over 28 minutes to keep
Mutombo as much of a non-factor as possible. Beneath the basket,
the 6-foot-10-inch Boston center kept his arms spread and
continually looked over his shoulder to monitor his Atlanta
counterpart. Meanwhile, Williams and Griffin often double-teamed
Rider, forcing him to take fadeaway shots and frustrating him.
</P>
<P>
   With the Celtics ahead by 24 points (96-72) and less than three
minutes remaining in the game, Walker could not help but smile
sheepishly and shake his head after he missed a wide-open slam
dunk. It was one of the rare occasions when a play did not go his
way. The Celtic forward finished with a game-high 24 points, while
Barros followed with 15. Griffin grabbed a team-high 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was definitely an important game for us, especially
before hitting the road,'' said Walker.

ANOTHER PIECE OF PAST GONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Bob Ryan 
c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's just a bunch of wood, right?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure. And Bill Russell is just some old guy who used to play
a little basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Those 264 panels compose nothing less than the single most
famous athletic surface in the entire world. From Beijing to Buenos
Aires, and all the Belfasts, Barcelonas, and Boca Ratons in
between, people know the look of that famed parquet. They know that
on those 5-foot-by-5-foot slabs the absolute best basketball that
has ever been seen on this, or any other, planet has been played.
They know that this floor has been trod on by the greatest players
and greatest teams and has been the site of the greatest games.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly why the Garden and Celtic pooh-bahs have decided that
the parquet floor is no longer suitable for NBA action has not been
adequately demonstrated. The Lakers didn't seem to have any trouble
playing decent ball on that floor Monday, and the Celtics weren't
so bad on it Wednesday night themselves. OK, there are a few
missing chunks here and there, and there have even occasional
rumors the floor might contain a few, shall we say, dead spots. But
that's part of the charm, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   How much better can a new floor be? One percent? Three percent?
Ten percent? Will a new floor bring back the 130-125 game? Is it
worth sacrificing what little is left of our precious basketball
tradition in order to have some new panels?
</P>
<P>
   I mean, geez, Bill Russell played every home game of his
majestic career on that floor. In fact, he played the first of
those games 33 years ago Wednesday, hauling in 16 rebounds as the
Celtics beat the St. Louis Hawks in the Old Garden. Bill Russell
was here to say goodbye to the parquet Wednesday night. How's that
for closure?
</P>
<P>
   Fine. But who wanted that closure? I doubt if Bob Cousy thought
it was such a hit idea. By the way, The Cooz says, ``Dead spots?
What dead spots?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of dead spots is pure, unadulterated crap,'' quoth
No. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, and not to disparage the opinion of the man who
probably bounced the ball more often than anyone who ever played on
the floor in question, but his is a clear minority view. Just about
everyone else agrees that the parquet floor very often has a mind
of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Take the simple act of dribbling. ``Sometimes it would come back
to you,'' explained Atlanta coach Lenny Wilkens, one of the great
guards ever to play this game. ``And sometimes it wouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Anderson had his first exposure to the vagaries of the
floor when he was barely out of diapers. Well, all right, that
might be a slight exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I played in the Boston Garden was in the Boston
Shootout,'' Anderson said. ``I had a few problems with the floor. I
remember a few times the ball didn't come back up.''
</P>
<P>
   That brings to mind the Quinn Buckner take. When colleague
Michael Madden asked him what it was like to dribble on the parquet
a few years back, Buckner replied, ``I don't know if you can call
it dribbling. I call it, `Putting it down and just hoping it comes
back up.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember coming in here when I was a rookie,'' recalled
Celtics assistant coach Lester Conner. ``I was coming down against
Gerald Henderson and I forget who else, but what I do remember is
that I wound up going one way and the ball went another. I always
figured that's why Larry Bird was out here so early. He never
seemed to have any trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Gerald Henderson, The Man With The Washboard Stomach
was back here to pay his respects to the floor Wednesday evening.
It was, of course, on this floor that he had his greatest
professional moment, picking off an errant James Worthy pass and
turning it into a basket that saved the Celtics from going down,
0-2, in the 1984 Finals.
</P>
<P>
   How many other great moments have taken place on that floor? 10?
50? 100,000? Bill Russell (Havlicek stole the ball), John Havlicek
(His freaky leaner off the glass in the Phoenix triple OT), Tom
Heinsohn (Russell's miraculous block on Jack Coleman to save Game 7
against St. Louis in 1957), K.C. Jones (Bird's steal against
Detroit and Isiah Thomas in 1987) and Bob Cousy (``We Love Ya,
Cooz!'' on March 17, 1963) each talked about a great parquet
happening during a nice halftime ceremony. We could talk about our
own special parquet memories until the next millennium. My favorite
is Dave Cowens belly-flopping after a ball he had knocked it away
from Oscar Robertson in the famed double-OT Game 6 against
Milwaukee in 1974. What's yours?
</P>
<P>
   We once had it all in Boston. We had the greatest team and the
greatest place to play. There was no better atmosphere in
professional basketball history than the Boston Garden on a steamy
spring evening. Will you ever, ever, ever forget the surreal aura
of the Heat Game in 1984? Air conditioning? Who the hell needs air
conditioning? This is our house, pal. You can't take it, you don't
deserve to be playing for a championship.
</P>
<P>
   Now, what's left? The Garden is gone. We were told it was going
to be OK in the new building because they'd be taking the floor and
the flags with them. Well? What gives? They've taken the floor away
and the Fleet is now just another overpriced, sterile new building.
And it's not like there'll be a new flag being hung anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   The floor was the last true link with the Celtics' great
history. ``It's like a part of me,'' said the inimitable Spider
Edwards, who was brought back to take one more walk down the floor
with his broom after the first period. ``I've spent half my life on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The parquet floor had a resonance that far transcended Boston.
With the floor now packed up forever, the old, sweet NBA of train
travel, doubleheaders, and three-to-make-two is now officially dead
and buried. It's naught but a Jumbotron, hey-ma-look-at-me world
now.
</P>
<P>
   So let the record show that at 9:19 on the 22d of December,
1999, in the last Boston Celtics home game of the century, Jamel
Thomas took a crisp feed from Doug Overton for the final basket on
the world's most famous floor _ a fast-break dunk. Be it known that
Walter McCarty air-balled the final shot from 3-point land. And
further let the record show that the last person to bounce a
basketball on the world's most famous basketball floor was
Atlanta's Chris Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   Say goodbye to history. Say hello to . . . ?

TCU HANDLES EAST CAROLINA IN MOBILE BOWL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ARTHUR GARCIA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOBILE, Ala. _ The future is now.
</P>
<P>
   It has been two seasons of history-making firsts for the TCU
football program. Bowl games, winning seasons, a conference title
and a rushing champion are just some of the chapters of a history
written and tradition recaptured with each game.
</P>
<P>
   Last night in this gulf port city in the backdrop of a
first-year bowl, the Horned Frogs slammed bookends on the school's
postseason chronicle. TCU's stunning 28-14 demolishing on No. 20
East Carolina in the inaugural Mobile Alabama Bowl marks the first
time TCU has won back-to-back bowl games since the 1936-37 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's special what this team carved out for itself in TCU
football history, with back-to-back bowl victories and back-to-back
winning seasons,'' Frogs coach Dennis Franchione said. ``Eight wins
has happened once in the last 40 years, so it's pretty amazing what
we have been able to do in two years. I don't think I could have
ever envisioned this back in December, 1997.''
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs finish the 1999 season 8-4 with their first five-game
winning streak since 1984. That's also the same year TCU last won
as many eight games, a number not reach previously since 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Franchione leaves Alabama today hoping the Frogs have convinced
a football world they belong among the nation's top 25 programs.
After falling behind 7-0 on the Pirates' second offensive play, TCU
dominated the proceedings, never giving ECU a chance to catch its
breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that gives us national respect and some credibility,''
said Franchione, 15-9 in his two seasons at TCU. ``We beat a Top-20
team and I think we really beat them pretty convincingly. If we
don't mess it up offensively two times down there in the red zone,
it's going to be a 42-14 game.''
</P>
<P>
   Freshman quarterback Casey Printers stamped his rookie year with
the bowl's player of the game honors. The DeSoto product surprised
the Pirates with a steady stream of bullet passes and timely runs.
Printers completed 13-of-19 pass attempts for 174 yards and a
touchdown with poise belying his experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew Casey was going to have to come in here and make some
plays,'' said Frogs tailback LaDainian Tomlinson, who rushed for a
game-high 124 yards. ``He didn't play like a freshman
quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Printers: ``They left the middle of the field open. When I
went back in my drops, we attacked it, and we did a great job of
catching the ball and heading up field.''
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs also regained their composure after a series of early
mistakes. LaTarence Dunbar fumbled on TCU's first drive, Mike
Scarborough dropped a Printers' long pass inside the ECU 10-yard
line and George Layne drew an unsportsmanlike penalty, knocking the
Frogs out of scoring position _ all in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept our focus,'' backup quarterback Patrick Batteaux said.
``We didn't let the weather or anything get us down. We had a
couple of penalties here and there, a couple mistakes, but we got
over it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Frogs did sustain three scoring drives in the first
half, giving TCU a 21-7 lead heading into the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not stop us the first half; we stopped ourselves,''
Franchione said. ``Fortunately, we managed to get three of them in
the end zone in the first half. If we don't make a mistake or two,
maybe we have five in the end zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Three touchdowns, five touchdowns, it didn't matter. TCU had an
answer for everything the Pirates did. Quarterback David Garrard
was sacked four times and never found a rhythm. ECU also lost 16
yards rushing on the night, the second consecutive year TCU held a
bowl opponent to negative yards rushing. Southern California lost
19 yards last year in the Sun Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't know where we was coming from,'' TCU linebacker
Shannon Brazzell said. ``They're a good team, give them some
credit, but when our team comes to play, we confuse everybody. We
bring funk.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU heads into the off-season with its future brighter than at
any time in the last half-century. The Frogs lose only four
starters and 11 seniors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot for our team,'' Franchione said. ``It means a
lot to our seniors, who two years ago at this time were 1-10. This
completes it for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Batteaux: ``This team is going to be even better. I'm just
glad I was a part of it. The tradition and going to the bowls, I
wish this team well.''

VALLEY RESIDENTS COME TO AID OF HOMELESS SHELTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Lisa Van Proyen  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Christmas spirit brought dozens of do-gooders
bearing gifts to a North Hollywood homeless shelter Wednesday. They
came to replace toys stolen by Grinch burglars from needy children.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 people many keeping themselves anonymous
</P>
<P>
   donated 600-plus toys and about $3,500 in cash and checks to the
shelter that serves needy children throughout the San Fernando
Valley, said Jeffrey Farber, assistant director for the Los Angeles
Family Housing shelters.
</P>
<P>
   On a normal day, the shelter receives about 20 gifts near the
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News spotlighted the shelter's needs with a front-page
story Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the most amazing outpouring of support I have ever
witnessed ... It makes you real proud to be a part of the San
Fernando community,'' Farber said.
</P>
<P>
   Some people, like Lysa Barry, owner of Barry &AMP; Associates, a
media relations firm based in Woodland Hills, rolled up their
sleeves and volunteered to help sort through the overflow of toys.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, Christmas is about the celebration of life, which is
truly seen through a child's eyes. The Grinch may have taken their
toys, but we can all pull together as a community to bring back
their joys,'' said Barry, whose firm donated about 50 gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Donors filling the shelter's parking lot on Wednesday were
forced to pull up to red curbs to donate gifts to the Valley
shelter at 7843 Lankershim Blvd.
</P>
<P>
   As a police officer readied to write traffic tickets, a shelter
official explained how people were replacing stolen gifts, said Ann
Jacobus, executive director of the shelters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The officer then said, `I'm going on my coffee break now,'''
Jacobus said.
</P>
<P>
   Burglars had stolen about 60 unwrapped gifts, valued at about
$1,000, from the shelter sometime between 6p.m. on Dec.10 and 8a.m.
on Dec.13 mostly getting away with toys intended for newborns to
4-year-olds, police said.
</P>
<P>
   There were no signs of forced entry, police said. A door may
have been left ajar.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, donors struggled to think of a reason why thieves
would steal from innocent children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like stealing their soul and the spirit of
Christmas. You can always replace a toy. These people don't realize
they're not stealing an object. They're stealing a feeling,'' said
Mary Ellen Hopper, 44, who donated about 30 toys.
</P>
<P>
   Harbour Community, a homeless shelter for women and their
children who are victims of domestic violence, rerouted their extra
70 donated gifts that would have been saved for birthdays to the
North Hollywood shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Garcia, 54, a Chatsworth in suburban Los Angeles man who
said he is walking around the world on a peace mission, even vowed
to walk about 30 miles from Chatsworth to the shelter knocking on
doors to get even more donations today while on his Christmas break
at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt my stomach drop and I knew we've got to do something.
Why would someone steal gifts from homeless children? It doesn't
make sense,'' Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of the day, shelter officials told him not to
worry they had received enough gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Shelter officials said they will find plenty of needy children
to give the gifts to even if it's to another sister shelter. And
the children will now get more than one gift.
</P>
<P>
   The director had a message to all the donors:
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only say thank you,'' Jacobus said. ``We will have the
best Christmas ever for our children. You made it happen.''

<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ The Los Angeles Unified School District keeps on
failing to do proper environmental studies and continues to
disregard state guidelines in its search for new school sites,
state auditors claimed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   District officials, saying policies have been improved in their
search for as many as 150 sites for new schools, disputed the
audit's findings.
</P>
<P>
   But the audit, saying the LAUSD board has yet to ratify new
guidelines, warns that a flawed site-selection process keeps board
members, as well as the rest of the community, in the dark and
could block state construction funds for the district.
</P>
<P>
   The information raises new concerns that the district is not
following through on promises to examine potential environmental
problems before settling on new school sites: promises that
officials made to gain $278 million up front to build 49 schools in
areas where schools are seriously crowded.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Scott Wildman, D-Burbank, a member of the State
Allocation Board that approves school funding, said he will call
for an immediate assessment of the district's compliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to the audit findings, I have been told that there
has been an underground effort by the district to circumvent these
procedures. It's business as usual at the LAUSD,'' Wildman said.
``I'm very concerned that unless they immediately clean up their
act in the next six months, I don't know if they will ever be able
to build new schools.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Richard Alarcon, D-Van Nuys, who requested the audit,
said the report shows that, despite promising changes, new members
of the school board are acting ``just as irresponsibly as their
predecessors.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year district officials agreed to accept oversight by the
state Department of Toxic Substances Control and seek its
certification that each school site is safe from environmental
hazards, but the school board has yet to sign that agreement, the
audit says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to face reality,'' Alarcon wrote in a letter to
school board president Genethia H. Hayes. ``The audit makes it
clear that little has changed regarding how the district selects
school sites. You repeatedly find ways to circumvent community
participation and ignore state guidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Miller, the LAUSD's chief operating officer, disputes the
audit's findings, saying the district regularly does preliminary
environmental studies as soon as it begins to consider a property.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he recently received the results of 50 such studies,
some of which showed potential environmental problems. He said that
some of those were from the 49 sites for which the district got
funds, but could not say how many.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Cordiner, the principal auditor assigned to the LAUSD
report, said ``that doesn't square with what Miller told us; he
never expressed any disagreement with the findings.''
</P>
<P>
   In a Dec. 14 letter to the auditor, Miller said he was ``in
complete agreement with (the audit's) findings and
recommendations.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Miller said he only agreed with audit findings
that showed the district in the past had failed to involve the
community in the decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
   District officials told state auditors that no environmental
studies were done for the 49 potential sites because they have not
made final choices. But district officials identified sites in a
document approved by the state Board of Education and told the
State Allocation Board that land had been chosen. &QL; 
In addition to getting up-front money toward 49 sites, district
officials are searching for at least 47 more sites. Cordiner said
campuses have been selected for 43 of the 47 but environmental
studies have been done for less than half that number.
</P>
<P>
   The audit says the district does not adequately consider
environmental issues, such as soil contamination, when first
evaluating a property. And while LAUSD officials will check to see
if a potential school site is near a highway with no sound buffer,
they have done a poor job of checking whether there are hazardous
wastes on or near the property.
</P>
<P>
   Because of district officials' lax evaluation of land, 16
schools are under construction or already built ``on or in close
proximity to sites containing hazardous substances,'' the audit
says, and two additional schools are on land under suspicion of
environmental troubles.
</P>
<P>
   The district has been required to do some soil analysis recently
by the state and has turned over environmental evaluations from the
real estate department to the environmental branch. But auditors
said it is too early to tell the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The audit says the district does only minimal analysis of public
acceptance of a site choice and of the costs of using alternate
sites.
</P>
<P>
   When auditors contrasted the district's selection procedure and
state recommendations, they found ``the district's procedure does
not provide sufficient guidance for staff to evaluate potential
sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Failure to evaluate sites well can be enormously costly, as at
the unfinished Belmont Learning Center and at South Gate High
School and South Gate Elementary School, both with massive toxic
problems. At Belmont, the school board approved starting what has
become the costliest high school project in the nation without
knowledge that it was violating state law in the purchase land,
containing oil pipelines, that had been used to dispose of waste
oil products, according to the audit.
</P>
<P>
   The `district staff has not always given the board accurate,
complete information,'' the audit says about staff recommendations
to the board to order feasibility studies and later acquire
specific sites.
</P>
<P>
   Auditors found, for example, that the district staff pressured
an outside environmental consultant to replace a critical air
quality assessment, one that found emissions from a gasoline
station and a dry-cleaning store across the street could be harmful
to children, with a more positive assessment prepared by the
district's own environmental branch.
</P>
<P>
   In the haste to acquire school sites, sometimes district
personnel fail to include the public in the search and to look for
alternative sites, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   In the haste to qet matching funds for all schools, district
personnel also have failed to give top priority to the search for
sites in areas most in need of schools, as identified in a 1998
master plan.
</P>
<P>
   Working under a self-imposed deadline of July 1, 2000, the
district has attempted to identify and qualify all potential
schools for state matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``By trying to do too much in the time allotted and not focusing
its efforts on the highest-priority schools, the district risks the
loss of matching funds for the most-needed new schools,'' the audit
says.

UCLA UPSET IN HAWAII
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAIE, Hawaii _ UCLA tried to impose its frenzied, fast-breaking
will on Colorado State on Wednesday. Instead, it was the Bruins who
wilted.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Kapono's 3-pointer from the left corner clanked off the
rim as the buzzer sounded, giving Colorado State a 55-54 upset
victory in the semifinals of the Pearl Harbor Classic.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA, which has not won an in-season tournament since 1990, will
play the loser of the South Florida-San Jose State in the
consolation game today.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins trailed 54-47 with several minutes left, but Dan
Gadzuric's lay-up and Rico Hines' free throws narrowed the deficit
to 54-51. After Colorado State's Aki Palmer lost the ball, UCLA
guard Ray Young buried a 3-pointer from the right wing to tie the
score.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA (5-2) had a chance to take the lead with a minute
remaining, but Kapono missed a difficult, left-handed shot from
close range. Colorado State center John Ford made one of two free
throws, setting up Kapono's last, errant chance.
</P>
<P>
   The game ended an inconsistent 24 hours for the No. 18 Bruins.
They played one of their best halves of the season Tuesday against
Maine, and one of their worst. After charging to a 20-point
halftime lead, they coasted through the final 20 minutes with
sloppy offense and lethargic defense.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Steve Lavin was in no mood to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I jumped them,'' Lavin said. ``I emphasized that we played
them even in the second half, and that's alarming.''
</P>
<P>
   He knew a repeat performance against Colorado State would result
in UCLA's second loss of the season. The Rams are big, smart and
efficient. They play at a methodical pace, and they don't take bad
shots. In other words, they're a classic UCLA antagonist _ like
Princeton, Detroit Mercy and Gonzaga.
</P>
<P>
   ``They spread the floor and use the clock,'' Lavin said.
``They're more deliberate. It's a good opportunity, because we'll
have to face teams like that over the course of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   The teams exchanged baskets for the first 11 minutes. But after
the Bruins pulled even on Gadzuric's lay-up, the Rams surged. Their
man-to-man defense forced several UCLA turnovers _ interrupted only
by several bad shots _ and the Bruins went seven minutes without a
basket.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, two field goals by Colorado State forward Ceedric
Goodwyn gave the Rams a 24-17 lead and forced the Bruins to call
timeout. Much needed, it did little good. The mistakes continued,
and they shuffled to the lockerroom trailing 29-20 _ having scored
three points in the final eight minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams played with what can best be described as speedy
patience. They didn't sit back in a zone defense; they played a
tight man-to-man throughout. They pushed the fast break, but only
when opportunities existed. They moved the ball quickly, mostly by
passing, but they did not take bad shots.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, they maintained superb court balance and limited
UCLA's fast break. The Bruins never got any easy baskets _ always a
bad sign for a team that struggles to execute its half-court
offense.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA shot 37.7 percent from the field in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The second half started much like the first ended: Young
committed a turnover on the first possession and was removed from
the game, then Ryan Bailey charged on the fast break.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the Bruins had no success with Goodwyn. At 6-8 and
230 pounds, he was too strong for their guards and too nimble for
their big men, and he scored six consecutive points to give the
Rams a 36-28 lead early in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA gradually tightened its defense, which energized the Bruins
_ they were dazed by Colorado State's first-half success _ and
forced several errant shots. One Rams miss became a highlight play
as guard Earl Watson threw an off-the-backboard pass to Jerome
Moiso for a thunder dunk.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rams maintained their composure in the face of UCLA's
chaos. Guard John Sivesand followed Moiso's dunk with a 3-pointer,
then center John Ford tipped home a miss. Soon, the Rams had
reclaimed a nine-point lead, and UCLA was forced to scramble.

GLENDALE SURVIVES TRIAL BY FIRE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Donna Huffaker  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE -- Nearly 600 firefighters battled on the ground and in
the air Wednesday to contain a fast-moving wildfire and save homes
perched on steep terrain in Glendale and La Canada-Flintridge.
</P>
<P>
   After consuming about 750 acres, the fire was 90percent
contained by Wednesday afternoon and no one was injured by the
blaze that broke out about 9:40 p.m. Tuesday, said Los Angeles
County Fire Capt. Steve Valenzuela.
</P>
<P>
   While winds gusting to 50 mph accelerated the flames, an
exceptionally bright full moon helped water-dropping helicopters
and ground crews battle the fire, which ultimately jumped the
Glendale Freeway and threatened homes less than a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   At sunrise, two water-laden SuperScooper planes joined the air
assault with six helicopters flying through thick smoke in an area
choked with obstacles, including power lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The air support for this fire was essential for containment,''
Valenzuela said. ``The operation worked like a well-orchestrated
play. Everyone had their part and everyone knew their lines.''
</P>
<P>
   As strong winds hit 50 mph on Wednesday, 25 residents fled their
homes, and staff members from Camp Max Straus in Glendale evacuated
60 children to the camp's offices in Los Angeles. The 112-acre camp
is located in the Glendale foothills.
</P>
<P>
   By midday, firefighters gained an upper hand on the wildfire,
but not before flames destroyed the Glendale Police Department
firing range and ignited some 24,000 rounds of ammunition, keeping
firefighters at bay.
</P>
<P>
   The Glendale City Council ratified a declaration of a local
state of emergency and hopes to be reimbursed for costs of the fire
from federal and state funds.
</P>
<P>
   The fire began at Starland and Sugarloaf drives in La
Canada-Flintridge and spread southwest into Glendale. Within
minutes, the flames charred 25 acres, Valenzuela said. Wind gusts
fanned the flames across 100 more acres in the next 30 minutes, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Around 3 a.m., flying embers sparked a flare-up and flames raced
up a hill on the east side of the Glendale Freeway, between the
Ventura and Foothill freeways, igniting a call box and engulfing
the guardrail, said Glendale Assistant Fire Chief Chris Gray.
Embers sailed to the freeway's west side but firefighters used
hoses to quash the fire immediately, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't lost a home at this point, and I don't want to take
any chances. I don't want to jeopardize anything by withdrawing the
equipment early,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In all, about 580 firefighters and 100 engines fought the fire
as Glendale stretched its resources to the limit and got help from
Burbank, Pasadena, South Bay, Santa Monica, Culver City, Alhambra,
Orange County and Los Angeles city and county fire departments,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   With many roads closed, more than 100 Glendale police officers
directed traffic at every cross street of Canada Boulevard north to
Verdugo Road, said Sgt. Rick Young. The drive into Glendale from
the foothills Wednesday morning was sluggish, but no real problems
occurred, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police and fire officials said multiple agencies cooperated
successfully.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities also used bulldozers to churn brush under dirt and
thus remove potential beds of fuel where wafting embers would have
taken hold. Because rainfall levels have been low this season and
last, the brush is dangerously dry and flammable, Valenzuela said.
Fire danger is approaching critical levels, he said.

RESIDENTS SPEND NIGHT WORRIED ABOUT FIRES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Jennifer Hamm  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Alice Skenderian sat up in a hotel room until dawn
Wednesday, sleepless and exhausted, watching news reports and
wondering what her family would do if they lost their home to the
fire that roared through more than 750 acres during the night,
threatening scores of hillside homes in Glendale and La Canada
Flintridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in a panic,'' said Skenderian, 46. ``It was
terrifying. Where would we go? How would we start from zero?''
</P>
<P>
   With daylight, the firefighters were able to deploy airborne
SuperScoopers, gaining control over the fire and eliminating the
threat to homes. Skenderian, like scores of residents who fled,
returned to find their houses intact.
</P>
<P>
   When the fire got close to the Skenderian house on Delisle Court
near the Glendale Freeway late Tuesday, the family was urged to
evacuate. Crying and distraught, Skenderian grabbed important legal
papers and valuable pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, Skenderian, her husband and their son jumped
into the car and headed into town, where they checked into a hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't sleep,'' she said. ``We just watched the news.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighbor Araxi Kousherian also spent the night in front of the
television, trying to see how close the fire was advancing toward
homes. She dozed off for a few minutes here and there, but the
early hours of Wednesday were filled with too much anxiety for
restful sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very bad night. It was terrible,'' said Kousherian,
52. ``I was thinking that my house would be black.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Red Cross Shelter set up in the Glendale High School
gymnasium, 17 people filled cots overnight. Families began arriving
just after 11 p.m. Tuesday, when the shelter opened.
</P>
<P>
   Some did manage to sleep, but most stayed awake and worried.
``They were anxious to know what was going on,'' said shelter
volunteer Mack Dugger.
</P>
<P>
   A.J. Avakian and her husband, Leon, were in the middle of a
movie late Tuesday when they got a pager message informing them of
the fire. The couple rushed home, grabbed their wedding photographs
and a few documents and went to stay with family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I freaked out when I saw how close it was, but I was OK after
that,'' said A.J. Avakian, 28.
</P>
<P>
   By 3 a.m. Wednesday, they decided to go home to check on the
house. They slept for a few hours, but decided to go back to their
relatives' house when the fire seemed too close.
</P>
<P>
   They were nervous and restless, she said, but not worried about
losing their home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take things as they come,'' Avakian said. ``You get
yourself out of there and the rest is just material.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning home Wednesday, residents found their homes standing.
Many said they were thankful that the holidays would be spent at
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thanked God,'' Kousherian said. ``Thank God nothing was
lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The only damage to her home was black soot that had fallen into
the pool. But even the white house looked spotless.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sharp contrast to the blackened flora along the
mountainside just feet away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, everyone has done pretty good up here,'' said Jim
Cooper, an engineer for the Glendale Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   Homes remained intact partly because of the high rate of
compliance with the city's weed abatement requirements, officials
said. Residents who live in high hazard areas are required to
annually eliminate all weeds within 100 feet of their property.
</P>
<P>
   The Fire Department accounts for 12,000 parcels of land, which
are occupied by about 4,000 homes, said Doug Nickels, Glendale Fire
Department's urban fire forester.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is in compliance,'' Nickels said.

KINGS RESPECTABLE BUT STILL LOSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE _ The Kings came back to life Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   After allowing 23 goals in three consecutive meltdowns, the
Kings were respectable in a 2-1 loss to the San Jose Sharks, who
were coming off three consecutive losses of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Part of it was the return of center Jozef Stumpel, who had
missed almost six weeks after abdominal surgery. Stumpel gave the
Kings the defense they have been lacking in 7-1, 8-3 and 8-4 loss
that dropped them into last place in the Pacific Division.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kings had no answer for the league's leading goal scorer
Owen Nolan, who got his 26th midway through the second period to
give the Sharks a 2-1 lead. San Jose came in 0-2 against the Kings
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Before Stumpel left the lineup, the Kings were 9-3-3 and among
the top teams in the Western Conference. Stumpel is the final
member of the Kings top line to return from injuries this season.
Luc Robitaille and Ziggy Palffy also have spent time on injured
reserve, but on their first night together they were held without a
point.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Division, which would qualify all five teams if the
playoffs started today, has been in a bit of a tailspin.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix Coyotes, who play the Kings on Sunday at the Staples
Center, had dropped five of six before routing the Mighty Ducks on
Wednesday in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings knew keeping the game close in the first period would
be critical to overcoming their slump. They had been outscored 13-1
in the opening 20 minutes the past week.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Sharks scored the first goal on a wrist shot by
Vincent Damphousse with 9 minutes, 42 seconds left in the first,
the Kings had shown enough grit to start rebuilding their
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   They killed off two penalties, got their forwards to play
defense and even got a couple of shots in a short-handed situation
midway through the period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew if we didn't come out of this game with win, if we
played well that would be a start,'' coach Andy Murray said.
``We've had some good practices and way too many meetings. But
until we got out there, we wouldn't know where we stood.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't all great. On the Sharks' first goal, defensemen Aki
Berg and Frantisek Kaberle collided in front of the net, giving
Damphousse an open look. He fired a 15-footer over Fiset's right
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   But as they had done early in the season, the Kings sent a
message late in the period when Smolinski rebounded a blast by Glen
Murray with 1:03 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings caught a break at the other end when the Sharks were
pressuring Fiset. Stephane Matteau took a shot from a bad angle
that struck Smolinski's skate and shot out to center ice.
</P>
<P>
   Murray picked up the puck, crossed the San Jose blue line and
let go a slap shot. Steve Shields made the first stop, but
Smolinski was trailing the play and fired in the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   It was the ninth goal of the season for Smolinski, who is among
the league leaders with 33 points in 34 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings survived the first period, but did not carry the
momentum into the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan, who leads the league in goals and power play goals, got
his 12th of the year and 26 overall with 8:51 gone in the period.
He took a pretty cross-ice pass from Damphousse and beat Fiset with
a 15-foot slap shot low to the stick side that gave San Jose a 2-1
lead.
</P>
<P>
   In his last 11 games, Nolan, who still trails Pittsburgh's
Jaromir Jagr in the scoring race, has at least one point against
every team except the expansion Atlanta Thrashers.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose had a chance for more with 3:10 left in the second when
Mike Ricci lift the puck over the right shoulder of Fiset. It
bounced off Fiset and hung in the air until Niklas Sundstrom took a
whack in front of the next.
</P>
<P>
   The puck dropped on the goal line, but never crossed. The fans
went wild, but referee Rob Shick ruled no goal. After a lengthy
review, the call stood.

FLU PROMPTS PLEA TO CUT PARAMEDIC WAIT IN ER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The annual flu outbreak has overwhelmed paramedic
services, prompting Los Angeles fire officials Wednesday to seek
approval for them to cut short the time they spend with patients in
hospitals so they can keep up with emergency calls.
</P>
<P>
   Under existing county Department of Health Services rules,
paramedics are required to stay with patients until they are
admitted to the hospital. City fire officials want county health
officials to relax those rules, allowing paramedics to return to
duty more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem isn't the number of calls we answer but the time
our people are spending in the hospitals to get people admitted,''
Battalion Chief Daryl Arbuthnott said. ``Because the hospitals are
jammed, our people have to spend more time there until a bed is
available.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Fire Chief Bill Bamattre has been meeting with
officials from the county health department over the past week to
try to relax regulations requiring paramedics to remain at the
hospital with a patient until a bed is available.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he has issued a special order canceling staff
training and taking other measures to keep more ambulances and
emergency medical personnel available to respond to calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The health officials might not call it this, but I think we
have a real epidemic on our hands and the hospitals are jammed,''
Fire Commissioner David Fleming said. ``It's times like this where
government has to be flexible. There is no reason for a paramedic
to stand around a hospital to wait for a bed to be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Hastings, director of the Emergency Medical Services
Agency for county health, agreed the waiting creates a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the time of year when call volume is up
substantially,'' Hastings said. ``I've heard some stories of
extraordinary delays. There is one report of a paramedic unit
waiting for three hours. That should not happen. The normal time is
15 to 30 minutes. The problem is, everyone is backed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Bamattre has told the county of his concern that the units are
out of service too long in some cases, resulting in delays in
responding to other emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Dassey, deputy medical director for acute communicable
diseases for the county, said he and other medical professionals
are reluctant to call the latest influenza outbreak an epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state has identified about a dozen different strains, but
they are all included in our vaccine,'' Dassey said. ``But we are
seeing what we normally see in December and the winter months. Some
influenza, some other upper respiratory diseases. What we get
concerned with is pneumonia.''
</P>
<P>
   Dassey said he believes the admitting delays are not so much a
function of more flu patients, but of fewer beds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a dramatic reduction in the number of staffed
beds since 1991,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of greater concern to him is why people would call a paramedic
for the flu or any other respiratory disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no need to use emergency medical services when we
have so many clinics around the county that offer primary care,''
Dassey said. ``There is no reason for people to use paramedics and
emergency rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, with so many people demanding paramedic runs to emergency
rooms for the flu, Bamattre issued an order this week blocking the
assignment of the department's 25 ambulances with emergency medical
technicians to fire scenes so they are available to respond to
general calls.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure all 50 city paramedic units are in operation,
Bamattre canceled all special training programs. He also is giving
area commanders authority to move paramedics off fire engines to be
available to staff ambulances.
</P>
<P>
   Arbuthnott said the paramedics are being given more leeway to
call in private ambulance firms to transport patients as long as
they are not in any health danger and it appears it will take some
time for transport.

created by the absence of almost any rainfall in the region for the
last six months.

<P>
   Despite gusting Santa Ana winds, firefighters lost only one
house during three wildfires that moved quickly over the parched
hillsides.
</P>
<P>
   And the end of fire season does not appear to be near, largely
because of the extreme dryness caused by La Nina. Although fire
season normally ends by early December with the arrival of rains,
this year's season is expected to last through January, if not into
February, firefighters said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really points to the fact we live in a very volatile
environment,'' said Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Brian
Humphrey. ``Southern California by nature of its geography and
vegetation is incendiary.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how incendiary 1999 has been was demonstrated Tuesday night
and Wednesday when three separate blazes, in Glendale, Ojai and the
Rincon, tore through thousands of acres of brush, requiring efforts
from hundreds of firefighters from companies throughout the Los
Angeles region.
</P>
<P>
   In Glendale, almost 600 firefighters from a dozen departments
battled a blaze that blackened about 750 acres, reaching 90 percent
containment Wednesday. In Ojai, fire burned more than 3,000 acres,
with no prediction for containment, and a smaller one on the coast
near the Santa Barbara-Ventura county line burned 300 acres, which
firefighters expected to encircle by the end of the day Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   With the prospect of more blazes across the San Fernando Valley
area of Los Angeles, the city Fire Department has deployed 16
engines, carrying 64 firefighters, around the Valley and on the
other side of the Santa Monica Mountains on Wednesday night,
Humphrey said. The deployment could continue today, depending on
conditions. To keep adequate personnel levels, the LAFD's Bureau of
Fire Prevention shut down so fire inspectors could be drafted into
firefighting duty.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley has received virtually no rainfall at all this year
since July only 0.08 of an inch recorded in Burbank _ compared with
an average of 5.86 inches, most of it usually in November and
December, according to the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   Similar trends were seen throughout Southern California, where
wildfires burned almost three times as much land this year as in
1998. More than a quarter-million acres of brush have burned in
more than 5,000 brush fires in Southern California this year,
according to the National Inter-Agency Fire Coordination Center.
Last year, which was also dry due to La Nina, there were about
4,100 fires that burned 89,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   The fires underscored the need for residents and businesses to
clear brush from their properties, although firefighters said brush
clearance was adequate in Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   Glendale Assistant Fire Chief Chris Gray said most of the brush
had been cleared around high-tension power lines and the freeway,
over which the fire jumped. ``The issue of clearance or lack of
clearance did not affect the fire,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   County and city fire spokesmen said most property owners have
complied with brush clearance regulations by now. Those who didn't
received visits from fire department-hired contractors, along with
a fat bill in the mail afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a group that lags that you have to go after,''
said John Todd, assistant chief of county fire's forestry division,
who oversees the brush clearance unit.
</P>
<P>
   In the last four years, though, that group has diminished to
about one-third the size, he said. In 1995, the county had to chase
after 1,500 property owners, sending them additional letters or
hiring contractors directly to do the work. This year, 500 property
owners did not comply initially, but by now about 99 percent of
county property owners have complied, Todd said.
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey urged those who have not already done so to prepare
their homes by checking for dead vegetation or rubbish around their
properties. Even those who don't live near heavy brush areas or
receive notices should be cautious, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We often find people becoming complacent, with the feeling
their homes won't be affected,'' Humphrey said. ``Even in the
middle of the Valley, in a tract, a fire could easily hopscotch
from roof to roof in the blink of an eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the massive aid sent to the Glendale and Ventura County
blazes, Los Angeles County and city firefighters said they had
enough personnel on duty to handle additional fires if needed.
County fire sent about 300 firefighters to Glendale out of 800
normally on duty, according to department spokesman Inspector
Edward Osorio. But many of them were called from home, so the
county had more than 500 firefighters available for other blazes.
</P>
<P>
   The city Fire Department sent a smaller response, only about 50
firefighters and 10 pieces of equipment, so plenty were on hand to
battle other conflagrations.
</P>
<P>
   When fire conditions are most hazardous, defined as sustained
winds at or above 25 mph and humidity of 15 percent or less, a red
flag warning is issued. Those warnings were issued for numerous
areas Wednesday, said Ron Hamilton, the U.S. Forest Service's fire
weather unit leader in Riverside.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton did not have an exact figure for how many were issued
this year, but said he believes it's more than any of the last 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   With no rain forecast any time soon, Todd said the hazardous
conditions are likely to remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we get two or three inches of a good storm to really
soak everything down, we're at a high fire hazard,'' Todd said.

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Matt Bullard had a rather modest goal for the season _ to get off
the injured list.
<TEXT>
<P>
   For most of training camp, it seemed like his job was to thank
fans for coming out before preseason games. He figured to be most
valuable to the organization as the Comets' radio analyst.
</P>
<P>
   But if he was to play this season, Bullard knew exactly what his
role would be. There really wasn't much to know. Rehabilitate his
latest knee injury, be a good guy in the locker room and, should
the occasion arise, knock down a few 3-pointers. And that was
pretty much it.
</P>
<P>
   But less than a third of the way into the season, Bullard finds
himself in a different role _ that of starter and team captain. He
leads the league in 3-point shooting. Media members swarm him after
practice, hoping to find a replacement go-to talker. And strangest
of all, Bullard cannot even disparage his defense, which usually
serves as fodder for his one-liners.
</P>
<P>
   Bullard, 32, wraps his left knee in ice and describes how he
defended Scottie Pippen on Tuesday night or what he expects tonight
when he matches up with Washington's Juwan Howard.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bullard remains a role player. While he has taken over
Charles Barkley's pre-game captain's handshake duties, he has not
supplanted him as the focal point of the offense.
</P>
<P>
   But in his ninth NBA season, including eight with the Rockets,
Bullard might have a larger stake in his team's success than ever
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally different,'' Bullard said of the sudden change in
job description. ``I'm enjoying it. It's rejuvenated me. I came
into the season, (and) my knee was really sore. I started the
season on the injured list. I thought I might be on the injured
list all year trying to get my knee better.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden our team is not making shots, and they bring
me in. Then Hakeem (Olajuwon) gets hurt and Charles gets hurt, and
all of a sudden I'm starting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally different than what I thought my role would be
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullard thought he had completed rehabilitation from the seventh
surgery on his left knee (and 11th knee surgery overall) in the
offseason. He began training camp on schedule, but when his knee
became increasingly sore, Bullard skipped almost all of the
preseason and started off the season on the injured list, hoping
the rehab time would allow him to strengthen the muscles around the
knee.
</P>
<P>
   When the Rockets' new-look offense bogged down, they went back
to posting up Barkley and Olajuwon inside, drawing double teams and
leaving the perimeter shooters open. That meant the Rockets needed
help, so with his knee ready, Bullard got the call.
</P>
<P>
   But when Olajuwon and Barkley went out, it might have seemed
that Bullard's usefulness went with them. Instead of being
misplaced in the revised offense, though, Bullard said he has
sought different scoring opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a bigger challenge,'' Bullard said. ``I'm
enjoying the way we're playing. It's exciting to watch. It's
exciting to play. It's not what I expected, but all of a sudden we
turned into that. It's rejuvenating to me.''
</P>
<P>
   With forward Walt Williams struggling with his shot, Bullard has
moved into the starting lineup for the first time since the 1997-98
season, providing an outside option when defenders sag to help out
against the drives of guards Steve Francis and Cuttino Mobley.
Bullard's shooting touch keeps teams honest on pick-and-rolls.
Although he is averaging only 5.4 points per game, he is shooting
51.3 percent from the 3-point arc.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always have to do things on scouting reports about
Bull,'' Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``They don't play the
pick-and-roll the same way when Bull sets the pick. He will occupy
a guy. If they come off him, he's a good outside shooter.''
</P>
<P>
   With his knee flaring up, such as Saturday when he could play
only into the second quarter, Bullard has made only four of 18
shots since becoming a starter. He had made seven of 12 shots in
his previous three games.
</P>
<P>
   As a starter, however, Bullard likely plays a larger part in
opponents' game plans. Defenders are more likely to remain focused
on staying with Bullard at the 3-point line, so Bullard has found
himself forced to pump-fake and shoot off the dribble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams have game plans to stop other teams' starters,'' he
said. ``I'm leading the league in 3-pointers, so they're not going
to let me get open shots. I have to try to find ways to get open or
hit different shots. That's interesting and fun to me, to try to
figure out other ways to hit shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Like defenses that have adjusted to him, Bullard has had to
adapt as well. After coming off the bench for so long, he has
learned to time his shooting touch for late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just so used to watching the game, getting into the flow,
it's hard to really be ready to play at the beginning of the
game,'' Bullard said. ``We're still trying to find the right mix. I
don't think we've found the guys yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know for a fact I'm better coming off the bench. That's how
I've been able to stay in this league. A lot of guys can't make
that adjustment to come off the bench ready to play. I know I can.
Right now, I'm starting so I'm trying to make that adjustment to be
ready to start at the beginning of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting thing about Bullard's three-game stint as a
starter might be the success he has had defensively.
</P>
<P>
   He has done surprisingly well on the end of the court where he
has long been considered a liability. He might not draw any
defensive comparisons to Bill Russell, but with back-to-back games
against Pippen and Howard, Tomjanovich was not forced to change his
lineup because Bullard was overpowered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm playing pretty good defense,'' Bullard said.
``I'm not a real good defensive player. But I'm able to move my
feet quicker. I think the more years you play in the league, the
better you can become by using your mind, your old vet tricks. I
think I'm doing a decent job. I'll keep trying to not be a
liability out there on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I even have two blocked shots this year. That's one more than
my yearly average.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not quite true. Bullard had 95 blocks coming into this
season. But if Bullard is not going to reject shots, he has forced
some misses.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a veteran,'' Tomjanovich said. ``He understands his
limitations. He's usually not going to overextend himself. He'll
make the guy (his opponent) have to do something that's not his
strong suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that he is playing more, he can offer some leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Hakeem and Charles were playing, I had a secondary
leadership role,'' Bullard said. ``I feel like I'm still a
secondary leader. We're trying to find who our primary leader will
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve, Cuttino, Shandon (Anderson), guys like that who are
playing all the minutes, they can set the standard as primary
leaders. I feel like I've been around. This is my eighth year with
the Rockets. I know what Rudy wants. I can help guys out.''
</P>
<P>
   And if nothing else, he has found himself well-qualified for his
new pre-game duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just say hi to the other team's captains,'' Bullard said.
``You crack a few jokes for the refs, try to get them on your
side.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
With two games remaining in the regular season, the New Orleans
Saints are embroiled in so much turmoil that coach Mike Ditka might
be out of a job after three seasons.
<TEXT>
<P>
   After the Saints received national attention for trading eight
draft choices, including first- and third-round picks in 2000, to
select Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams in the first round,
nothing has gone right.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has been in and out of the lineup because of ankle
injuries, and the Saints are in a 2-14 backslide, with a five-game
losing streak and only one victory since a season-opening win over
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``With anything in life, there comes a point where you have to
address all problems, and we'll address all the problems,'' Ditka
said.
</P>
<P>
   And the problems continue to mount.
</P>
<P>
   If the Saints lose their last two games to Dallas and Carolina,
as expected, they will be 2-14. If Cleveland also finishes 2-14,
the Saints will earn the first pick in the draft because they
played an easier schedule than the Browns.
</P>
<P>
   But the Saints won't have the top pick. It belongs to Washington
because of the Williams trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints aren't losing close games, either. The defense, a
strength the last two seasons, has collapsed. The Saints have
surrendered at least 30 points in their last six defeats.
</P>
<P>
   An offense that was going to count so heavily on Williams, who
has missed the last four games because of an ankle injury, averages
only 15.4 points, 28th in the league. When the Saints host the
Cowboys on Friday, they will start their fourth quarterback this
season _ Jake Delhomme.
</P>
<P>
   Delhomme follows Billy Joe Hobert, Billy Joe Tolliver and Danny
Wuerffel, who have been injured or ineffective. Delhomme has been
buried so deep on the bench, he doesn't even classify as a
journeyman.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the controversy is the volatile Ditka, who is
experiencing the worst season of his 14-year coaching career. There
are reports that owner Tom Benson wants to reach a settlement with
Ditka on his contract, which has three years left at a total value
of $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Benson issued a vehement denial, but he hasn't given Ditka the
dreaded vote of confidence, which would almost guarantee his exit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're full of ,'' Benson said about a Fox report last
weekend that he will buy out Ditka's contract. ``I don't know how
they came across a report like that. All they're doing is hurting
people with a statement like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already said everything I'm going to say on the matter.
I'm not going to make any decisions until the season is over. This
is not the time nor the place to say anything else. At the end of
the season, I'll do whatever I think is necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   After exploding several times earlier in the season when his
behavior was perplexing to his players and fans, Ditka has been
rather subdued of late.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might not have a future (with the Saints),'' Ditka said.
``If we were to fall prey to the whims of a few of the people
(reporters) in this audience, I wouldn't have a future, would I? I
stand behind all the decisions I've made.''
</P>
<P>
   There already have been lists of possible replacements in the
New Orleans media.
</P>
<P>
   Ditka and general manager Bill Kuharich, who received a contract
extension before the season, are under fire. Benson isn't showing
his hand, but because attendance is down and the fans and media are
howling for changes, he is expected to do something after the
season.
</P>
<P>
   There is even speculation about which television job Ditka will
take next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to grips with my life a long time ago,'' Ditka said.
``No matter what happens here, this is nothing like what happened
to me in Chicago. I happen to like Tom and have a great deal of
respect for him. Whatever happens here, I'm a big boy. I'm mature
enough to accept it and go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, losing and the widespread speculation about Ditka
have been distracting for the Saints. The 12 losses are the most of
his career. It is the third-most defeats the Saints have suffered.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints were swept by the AFC this season for the first time
since 1985. Longtime Saints fans are calling this season the worst
since they were 1-15 in 1980, leading former owner John Mecom to
hire Bum Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   If Williams had been healthy all season, the Saints probably
would have a better record. The idea was to hitch the wagon to him
and let him help them improve on back-to-back 6-10 records.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has rushed for 816 yards but has scored only two
touchdowns. To make matters worse, the Saints look terrible because
Indianapolis bypassed Williams for Edgerrin James, who leads the
AFC with 1,400 yards rushing and will be voted NFL Offensive Rookie
of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Ditka is hoping Williams will be able to play against the
Cowboys, but he won't take unnecessary chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be foolish to jeopardize his career,'' Ditka said. ``When
he's ready to play, he'll play.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditka insists he has no regrets about making the Williams trade,
and he doesn't care what people around the NFL say about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the matter with it?'' he said. ``My life has never been
predicated by what the league thinks. I've never tried to (make a
decision) because the league says this. The league, to me, is not
the higher authority. We made a decision we thought was best for
the Saints.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young man's an outstanding football player, and he's been
hurt. You retrospectively say you could have done better with seven
draft picks instead. Maybe, maybe not. That's questionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think we've got the pieces in the puzzle upside down
right now. That's what's happened, but I think he's an awfully good
football player. You can do anything you want to do. I'm not going
to back off our decision. I didn't care about what people said
about us back in April, and I don't care what they say about it
now.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Saints have needed more than anything is a quarterback.
Ditka wants another veteran next season, but they need to draft a
young one they can develop, a quarterback who gives the fans hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish that my confidence in the quarterback situation would
have been rewarded a little bit more, that the kid could have
stayed healthy,'' Ditka said of Hobert. ``He was the guy who I
thought was going to be our starting quarterback. Not that he
hasn't played well at times, but he hasn't been healthy enough.
That's a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Ditka has tried to convince everyone that he has
mellowed over the last few years, they know it's not true. They
know he is in agony over losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My disappointment's greater than a lot of people's,'' he said.
``We're going to try to correct it. I'm going to do my best as long
as I'm in this organization to get it right. That's all I'm going
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditka insists he wants to return in 2000. Some wonder why he
doesn't just throw up his hands and say he is finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what?'' Ditka said. ``We're 2000 years from the birth
of Christ. We're going to have Christmas on the 25th. I'm going
into the twilight of my life. I'm just enjoying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would I worry about the scrutiny of others? Have you ever
read it's not the critic that counts? Unless you've been in the
arena, you don't know anyway. It's easy to point the finger, and
after the fact, Jack.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the fact, Jack, I have the answer, and I have the
solution, but when the game's on the line, do you really have the
answer or the solution? No, and that's why any decision we make on
the sidelines, the determining factor at the end of the season we
make is still based on how we execute on the field.''

<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
YOU get a sense of how garbled this NFL season has been when you
note that the Dallas Cowboys, with a pedestrian 7-7 record, visit
New Orleans on Friday in a brave attempt to keep alive their Super
Bowl ``hopes.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the field, the embattled Mike Ditka will make what may be
his last stand in the city where fans invented the custom of
wearing paper bags over their heads to conceal the fact that they
have spent the time, and money, to watch the Saints play.
</P>
<P>
   It just doesn't get any better than this, does it?
</P>
<P>
   A victory over the Cowboys, even this pale imitation of what was
once America's Team, may be enough to save Ditka's job, if he wants
it saved. Yet the Cowboys have sunk so low that a loss to the
Saints may not qualify as a big, big upset.
</P>
<P>
   You can almost hear the 'Boys belting out the lyrics, ``Good
mornin', America, how are ya? Say, don't you know me? I'm your
native son ''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, this is one of the local anthems, about a choo-choo
train, but the lines seem to apply more neatly to the boys who wear
the star: ``And I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't even think about the complications that had to occur to
bring you this attraction on Christmas Eve, when the Superdome will
be packed with hostile fans, yelling for blood. Pumped up on egg
nog and other libations, the fans will want little else for
Christmas than to watch Dallas lose. The next-best thing would be
watching the Saints lose.
</P>
<P>
   The home team is not very popular at the moment, known once
again to its detractors as the Aints, the name used whenever their
wins total two or fewer. The fans have poured food and beer on the
players as they retreated to the locker room. Ditka has reacted in
predictable ways, and apologized for them, including a very obscene
gesture captured on television.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the weekly agonies of Iron Mike has become a sport in
New Orleans, a great town for curses, with all those exotic shops
featuring voodoo masks and vials of dragon's blood, incense,
stuffed bats, tarantulas and toads, and hex-removing sprays in
aerosol cans.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't easy to determine which football team inspires more
sympathy. Yeah, the Cowboys have been crippled by injuries, but the
Saints are the first team in the history of professional football
to have two quarterbacks named Billy Joe disabled in the same
season. They will be down to their fourth starter, Jake Delhomme,
who wasn't even on the depth chart in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cowboys win Friday and at home against the Giants, they
can win the NFC East. The Saints have desperation on their side.
They need a victory to avoid edging out the rookie Cleveland Browns
for the title of worst team in pro football.
</P>
<P>
   After winning a Super Bowl in Chicago, Ditka has known little
but misery and criticism in New Orleans. He was admired for his
boldness when he traded his entire draft for Ricky Williams, the
Heisman Trophy winner from Texas. The publicity flowed like fine
French wine, but Ricky hasn't had a healthy body all year and isn't
expected to play Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the tourists who plan to spend Christmas in New Orleans
cannot fail to enjoy themselves, unless they hibernate in their
hotel rooms and only go to the game.
</P>
<P>
   This is the home of the best black and white music in America,
from riverboat to rock. It is where the blues were born, and
Preservation Hall is still regarded as a shrine, where the
white-haired survivors of the funeral marching bands still play
jazz the way it was.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints would appear to have no weapons with which to beat
Dallas, unless you count Bourbon Street, where the action slows
down around 4 in the morning. After that there are only the
sad-eyed and solitary drinkers milling around, and some of the fun
has drained away. This is the hour for Morning Call, the famous old
coffee and cruller house down at the French Market.
</P>
<P>
   Comes daytime, and the French Quarter is transformed. When the
lights go out and the sun comes up, you can appreciate the graceful
lines of an ageless architecture _ if you can get your eyelids to
open. The balconies provide high, open spaces to catch the breeze
from the Mississippi; the streets are made narrow for shade. The
history begins to come through, too. Every street and almost every
building in the 10 square blocks of the Quarter has its own
history.
</P>
<P>
   The Custom House was once a Confederate prison. In the light of
day, you can see clearly the Old Absinthe House, once a tavern
where Andrew Jackson is said to have planned the defense of New
Orleans in 1815. Before that it was supposedly the haunt of the
pirate brothers, Pierre and Jean Lafitte.
</P>
<P>
   Now come the Cowboys and the Saints, living small among the
ruins.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ To paraphrase a certain wartime prime minister, you
might say that Britain and the United States are two countries
divided by a common religious holiday.
</P>
<P>
   That is Christmas, except that you can't say Christmas here, of
course, for fear of offending non-Christians, for whom it is not a
holiday but a shopping opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   It can be a baffling time for expatriates and, it seems, for
some Americans also.
</P>
<P>
   Even the first lady hasn't quite got the nuances of the season
taped. My neighbor at a dinner the other night, recounted how she
had recently arranged a breakfast meeting for Hillary Rodham
Clinton in New York City among supporters and donors.
</P>
<P>
   After it was over, guests were lining up to complain to her
about Hillary's speech. She had mentioned Christmas no fewer than
six times, but had never once made reference to the Jewish holiday
of Hanukkah.
</P>
<P>
   This would have been clumsy from any speaker in New York in
December. But from Hillary _ who wants to be its senator _ it was
plain dumb.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner, by the way, was given by a British couple whose
friends are mostly Americans. They win the prize, by contrast, for
cross-cultural sensitivity. We were called to together to
``celebrate the festive season.''
</P>
<P>
   There was Christmas pudding and a vanilla mousse affair for
dessert and, for the main course, turkey but also scallops. (The
incineration of the pudding in a puddle of brandy evidently
astonished a Japanese couple at my table. They had mousse.)
</P>
<P>
   Cleverest of all was the carol-singing after dinner. Ushered
into a small salon with a grand piano and professional pianist
waiting, we received nineteen pages of our favorite Christmas
numbers with all their verses. But the favorites in America are
often completely unfamiliar to the British.
</P>
<P>
   It was a little shocking to realize that I was enjoying singing
the American numbers almost more than the ones I knew from English
school days. I think it must be the Bob Hope in me.
</P>
<P>
   Among those you might want to try at home (after a drink or
three) are: ``It's Beginning to Look Like Christmas,'' ``Winter
Wonderland,'' ``Rockin' Round the Christmas Tree'' and ``Let it
Snow! Let it Snow! Let it Snow!''
</P>
<P>
   There was only one that we all felt compelled to sing twice _
``White Christmas'' (As in, ``I'm dreaming of...'').
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, I think I have got the lights more or less
right on our house. Draping your every down pipe and garden shrub
with thousands of tiny white bulbs is obligatory in the suburbs. I
swear they will be able to spot our road from the just-launched
shuttle. It doesn't just glow, it pulsates.
</P>
<P>
   I am pleased with myself, because I have finally twigged to the
labor-saving magic of those little timers normally used to switch
lamps on and off to trick burglars when you are away.
</P>
<P>
   Now the two sets of lights snaking around our home can look
after themselves at dusk and midnight. No more traipsing out in the
snow in underwear at bedtime to pull out plugs from soggy outdoor
sockets, risking electrocution.
</P>
<P>
   I am proud of one friend, who is resolutely keeping her house
dark this year. The neighbors, she says, can lump it. But then, she
is in a funk generally.
</P>
<P>
   Fed up with sulky, adolescent offspring, she is also refusing to
trim a Christmas tree that stands ready in her sitting room,
expectant but entirely naked.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the right Christmas tree is a whole other challenge. I
am not sure if it is genetic engineering, but the trees here are
simply fuller and shapelier than the sorry twigs I remember in
England. But the pressure is on every year to find the perfect
specimen.
</P>
<P>
   We have failed this time _ the tree's skirt is a little narrow.
We got it from among hundreds piled outside our local church.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, we have driven to a tree farm to tramp around in
forests of the things with a saw. This is invariably miserable.
Undergrowth obscures the trees and last year my wife took a slice
from our son's nose.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, we will try a different farm that chops the trees for
you and hangs them from a wooden frame like so many turkeys. Then
you can study their profile without hindrance.
</P>
<P>
   We have tripped up in our search for an organic turkey also.
When we rang the wonderful delicatessen that is near the Vermont
house where we will be spending Christmas itself, they told us that
they weren't doing turkeys this year.
</P>
<P>
   I suggested to them that this was a little eccentric. They
replied that the local farm that supplies them simply has none left
_ all of their birds were eaten at Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, here is this year's 100 percent politically-correct
seasonal greeting: ``Have a Merry Millennium.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Russia and America are starting up an unprecedented joint early
warning system this week, amid fears that the millennium ``bug''
could start a nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   Top brass from both sides will watch missile warning screens
side by side in a specially constructed building until a week after
the new year.
</P>
<P>
   They will try to detect false alarms from computer glitches, and
avoid launching nuclear strikes in response.
</P>
<P>
   But leading experts _ including Nobel Peace Prize-winners and
one of America's most distinguished bomb designers _ says this does
not go far enough, and are campaigning for Presidents Yeltsin and
Clinton to deactivate their nuclear arsenals over the turn of the
year. They say that the dangers have been made even greater by the
tensions over the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The two superpowers have 4,400 nuclear weapons _ more than
enough to destroy the world _ ready to be launched at a moment's
notice.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, experts say, false alarms generated by faulty
equipment have caused an alarming number of near misses: on one
occasion a poorly designed chip, costing just 64 cents, deep in the
U.S. Defense Department's telephone switchboard hardware, started
sending out signals that a Soviet attack was under way.
</P>
<P>
   Last year an authoritative report concluded that there could be
``no confidence'' that the Pentagon would get its systems ready for
Y2K, as the millennium bug is known in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Though the U.S. has enormously improved its preparedness since,
experts say that no one can be certain that its systems are 100
percent fool-proof; and there is acute alarm about Russia's
decaying nuclear control system.
</P>
<P>
   This Wednesday some 20 senior Russian officers will join a
similar number of Americans at a specially built ``Center for Y2K
Stability'' in Colorado Springs, Colo., near the U.S. early warning
command center deep in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The center will become fully operational on Dec. 28 and from
then until Jan. 7 two Russian officers and two Americans will sit
side by side around the clock, with hotlines to their respective
command centers.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement, which has echoes of the admission of a Russian
general to the U.S. war room in the film ``Dr. Strangelove,'' is
modeled on the shared system of air-traffic control used in Berlin
during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   But experts insist that the chances of an accidental war remain.
Sir Joseph Rotblat, a member of the wartime Manhattan Project, who
won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1995 for his work on nuclear
disarmament, told The Independent on Sunday: ``You cannot exclude
the possibility that something may go wrong. The probability of it
may be very slight, but the consequences would be enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor Ted Taylor, who was one of the U.S.'s most senior bomb
designers, adds: ``No one can estimate the risk. It may be one in
10 or one in 1,000, but it is certainly there.''
</P>
<P>
   He says that keeping nuclear weapons on red alert after the end
of the Cold War ``may be one of the biggest mistakes humans have
ever made.''
</P>
<P>
   Both have joined the campaign led by Dr. Helen Caldicott, the
founding president of Physicians for Social Responsibility, which
is trying to persuade the leaders of both superpowers to deactivate
their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The critics say that the danger is not that nuclear weapons will
launch themselves automatically, but that the millennium bug will
cause false alarms and shorten the 15 minutes in which a decision
has to be taken on whether to launch a retaliatory strike.
</P>
<P>
   With tensions between Russia and the United States at their
highest for years, even the joint control center may not overcome
the mistrust, they say. &QL;

PACIFIC BELL HIT WITH HEFTY FINE FOR MISLEADING CUSTOMERS  
 
 
 
</HEADLINE>
   By TOM ABATE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
 
SAN FRANCISCO _ A California Public Utilities Commission judge
fined Pacific Bell $20 million Wednesday for misleading customers
into buying extra phone services and ordered the phone company to
spend an additional $24 million on a consumer-education campaign.
<TEXT>
<P>
   On top of the fine, which will go into the state's general fund,
the judge also ordered Pacific Bell and the PUC to come up with a
plan to identify and provide refunds to consumers who may have been
misled.
</P>
<P>
   In her 96-page decision, PUC Judge Maribeth Bushey justified the
huge fine _ believed to be a record against a California phone
company _ because of Pacific Bell's ```recidivist'' behavior. The
company was fined $16.5 million for similar marketing abuses in
1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk about recidivism in a criminal terms, it usually
means a habitual criminal,'' said Kelly Boyd, with the California
Public Utilities Commission's Office of Ratepayer Advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Bell spokesman Doug Michelman said his company was
outraged by the decision and will appeal the order to the PUC
within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The findings in the decision are unwarranted, irresponsible
and unfairly single out Pacific Bell for sales and service
practices that are common in our industry and many others,''
Michelman said. ``We do believe our sales and service practices are
appropriate, legal, ethical and designed to meet the needs of our
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   The case arises from complaints first filed before the PUC in
April 1998 by the Utility Consumer Action Network in San Diego and
other groups representing phone customers.
</P>
<P>
   After a weeklong hearing in January, the case was referred to a
PUC judge. Utility Consumer Action Network President Charles
Carbone said consumer groups ``have waited with bated breath''
since then for a decision.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer groups accused Pacific Bell salespeople of
misleading customers into thinking that it is difficult to block
caller ID, so that Pacific Bell could sell more caller ID equipment
and services. Caller ID boxes show the phone number of incoming
calls, but 44 percent of Californians have opted to block their
numbers, which has hindered the company's sales of the equipment
and service.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also charged that Pacific Bell sales representatives
duped customers into buying expensive options like call-forwarding
and three-way calling by bundling them into packages with such
names as ``The Basics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They put together packages with all the bells and whistles,
and they called them basic service,'' Carbone said. ``So, instead
of ordering basic service for $11.25, customers got socked with $30
charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyd said she thinks the $20 million fine is the largest the PUC
has ever imposed on a phone company.
</P>
<P>
   But Pacific Bell may not have to pay the entire $20 million. In
her order, Bushey said the phone company might have to pay only $10
million, ``depending on Pacific Bell's cooperation with the
remedial steps ordered in this decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Those steps include creating a $24 million advertising campaign
to inform consumers about basic phone services and the rules for
blocking caller ID.
</P>
<P>
   Bushey's decision could spur district attorneys for Alameda, San
Mateo and Monterey counties to reopen lawsuits that they filed in
September against Pacific Bell. The district attorneys charged that
the phone company was continuing to mislead consumers even as it
was awaiting a decision on the PUC action.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd said a Superior Court judge essentially threw out that case
in October, saying the district attorneys had not shown that they
had standing to represent consumers in a matter regulated by the
state PUC. Boyd said Bushey's ruling would show the district
attorneys where they might have standing, should they desire to
revive their suits.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorneys could not be reached for comment.

CHEESY THOUGHTS ON THE MOON  
  
</HEADLINE>
   By SCOTT OSTLER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
 
I never learn. I spent too much time marveling at last night's
lunar phenomenon and wound up with a nasty moonburn.
<TEXT>
<P>
   First aid for moonburn is to slather on a coating of cream
cheese, and just my luck, I was out of lox and bagels.
</P>
<P>
   But it was worth it. The moon hit my eye like a big pizza pie.
Why can't we write songs like that any more, songs that ask eternal
questions, like am I in love or did I eat too much pasta pazool?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, it's amazing to realize the moon is really only about 15
miles away, and getting dangerously closer. Using binoculars, I
could even make out the sign on the Sea of Tranquility: ``Coming
soon: Starbucks.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; THE WEATHER'S  &LR; so crazy, there have even been outbreaks of spring
fever.
</P>

   Jack the hack was pulling his cab into the Veterans company lot
one recent balmy midnight and noticed, on the ledge of an extremely

bragging of ``Non-stop 49ers action.''

an uncanny description of the 49ers' defense?''

</P>
<P>
   Geologist James Berkland, who predicted the Loma Prieta quake,
says watch out. He discovered a strong correlation between extreme
tides (like now) and earthquakes, and says that between now and the
29th, there is an 85 percent chance of a 3.5-to-6 shaker within 140
miles of San Jose, and an 85 percent chance of a 7-plus somewhere
in the world, probably in the Pacific Rim.

LEADERS ELATED BY MAINTENANCE DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM SKEEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALMDALE, Calif. _ The arrival of a Swiss aircraft maintenance
operation, and the 3,000 to 5,000 jobs that come with it, will be a
massive shot in the arm to the Antelope Valley economy and will
help bring in more businesses, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As reported in the Los Angeles Daily News on Wednesday, Gov.
Gray Davis is scheduled to announce at 11 a.m. today that SR
Technics, a subsidiary of SAirGroup, will establish an aircraft
maintenance, repair and overhaul plant at Boeing's Site 9 adjoining
Air Force Plant 42.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Santa Claus exists, this is what he would bring,'' Palmdale
Mayor Jim Ledford said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Employment estimates range anywhere from 3,000 to 7,000 workers,
who will perform scheduled heavy maintenance, repairs, overhauls,
paint jobs avionics upgrades and other modifications for jetliners.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier interview with the Daily News, Michael Rodyniuk,
director of business alliances for SR Technics, said initial
employment will be in the hundreds and, by the year 2005, will
extend into the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   SR Technics is seeking to establish a global network of
maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities that will allow the
company to provide service for any airline worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to a massive impact on the economy,'' said David
Myers, regional manager for the Los Angeles County Economic
Development Corporation. ``These will be high-wage, high-value jobs
that won't go away in three years. People are going to have the
confidence to invest in Palmdale.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers said the SR Technics move will have a ripple effect,
causing the company's suppliers to consider moving to the region.
The move will also cause other companies planning relocation to
consider moving to the Antelope Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Antelope Valley officials said officials from government and
industry came together to help make the deal happen, including the
governor, state Secretary of Trade and Commerce Lon Hatamiya and
representatives of Palmdale's economic development department, the
Antelope Valley Aerospace Alliance and Antelope Valley College.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman George Runner, R-Lancaster, described the SR
Technics decision as good news for the Antelope Valley and
California, but tempered his remarks with the proviso of ``if it
comes true.'' Runner noted Friday that the decision is still
unofficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's amazing is that 90 days ago this was nowhere,'' Runner
said. ``It's a great Christmas present for the Antelope Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Runner said he received a call last week from the state Trade
and Commerce Agency asking him to contact SR Technics regarding
air-quality issues. SR Technics officials were under the mistaken
belief that the Antelope Valley was still governed by the South
Coast Air Quality Management District, which, right or wrong, has a
reputation for being difficult to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   The Antelope Valley is governed by its own air-quality control
district, split off from the South Coast AQMD in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Runner said the governor has been closely following the SR
Technics discussions and calling the Trade and Commerce Agency
secretary about it almost daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that the governor was highly involved in this
issue,'' Runner said.
</P>
<P>
   If SR Technics opens a commercial aerospace operation in
California, it could help relieve the state's dependence on
military aerospace projects, Runner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can break the myth that California can't be
competitive,'' Runner said.
</P>
<P>
   SR Technics' site requirements include fair weather; hangars
large enough to accommodate jetliners such as the Boeing 747-400,
the Boeing 767, the Boeing 777 and the Airbus A-330 and A-340; an
available skilled work force; and a region where the population
appreciates the aerospace industry.
</P>
<P>
   Site 9, where Rockwell International assembled 100 B-1B bombers,
offers 1.3 million square feet of office and manufacturing space,
including two high-bay hangars. The Antelope Valley also averages
345 days a year of clear flying weather.
</P>
<P>
   The Site 9 land is actually owned by Los Angeles World Airports,
the city of Los Angeles airports department. Boeing owns the
buildings, which it acquired when it took over Rockwell's space and
aircraft operations.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has been trying to sell Site 9 as part of a consolidation
plan announced several months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Other benefits for locating in the Antelope Valley include the
region's designation as an enterprise zone, where industry can get
state tax credits on equipment purchases and on wages for employees
hired through certain programs or from low-income areas; federal
tax breaks on imported items; and possible assistance through the
Antelope Valley Aerospace Alliance, a cooperative effort of the
region's major aerospace companies. Antelope Valley College
cooperates by offering help in creating training programs;
</P>
<P>
   There is also about $1.4million in state funding available for
job training, said Lancaster Mayor Frank Roberts, who serves as
chairman of the Antelope Valley's one-stop job training and
employment office.
</P>
<P>
   One major drawback for the Palmdale site was the lack of a
deluge system to protect against flash fires or fires from fueled
aircraft entering hangars.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles officials say the city would supply an $11 million
fire sprinkler system, according to sources.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL 2ND TAKE FOLLOWWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another hurdle, according to sources familiar with the
negotiations, was a $5 million gap between what SR Technics was
willing to offer for a site and what Boeing was seeking for Site 9.
It was not immediately known how that was settled.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce B. Hailstone, president-elect for the Greater Antelope
Valley Association of Realtors, says he believes the new jobs will
help the valley's improving home market.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be an additional boost to the already
recovering market we see out there,'' Hailstone said.
</P>
<P>
   The valley market will benefit whether the jobs are taken by
Antelope Valley residents who now commute or work at lower paying
jobs, by newcomers or by a mixture.
</P>
<P>
   For those already living in the valley, new jobs for SR Technics
are likely to give them more income, making them prospects for
selling the homes they have and buying better ones, Hailstone said,
and newcomers are likely to buy houses rather than rent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all win,'' Hailstone said.

SALES BRISK AS CHRISTMAS NEARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SUZIE ST. JOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Northridge Fashion Center officials don't need a
long-winded sales report to tell them sales are substantially up
this holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   They just asked Santa.
</P>
<P>
   Photo sales at the mall's Santa station are up 23 percent over
last year, a double-digit surge in business that is being
duplicated at shopping malls across the region.
</P>
<P>
   As predicted, Saturday was the highest selling day of the
holiday season. But with only two shopping days left until
Christmas, retailers said Wednesday that the best is yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our stores are really pulling in a lot of sales. It's going to
continue to increase and we think (today) and Friday will be the
busiest days,'' said Shana Yao, marketing director for the Sherman
Oaks Fashion Square.
</P>
<P>
   Those expectations are being shared by other area malls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The week leading up to Christmas is when the mania takes
place. The significant increase in traffic translates into higher
sales,'' said Northridge Fashion Center's marketing director Joey
Char. ``It's kind of hard not to do well when the economy is doing
so good.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales data released this week by TeleCheck Services Inc., the
world's leading check processing company, shows that Los
Angeles-area shoppers are proving to be last-minute buyers. There
was a sales gain of only 3.3 percent during the first 17 shopping
days of the season, but that sales gain jumped to 5.2 percent by
adding the last seven days. Nationally, there was an increase of
5.8 percent in the first 24 shopping days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saturday, Dec. 18, was the busiest day so far of the season
and typically that's what it's been, but we could end up with an
even bigger day,'' said TeleCheck spokeswoman Marjorie Fowler.
``There's always a segment of the population who are waiting 'til
the last minute to shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, three of the biggest shopping days were in the week
before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Yao speculated that the unseasonably warm temperatures have also
had an impact on shopping and spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to think of Christmas shopping when it's so hot
outside. I remember that last year at this time, it was really
cold,'' Yao said.
</P>
<P>
   With Christmas falling on Saturday this year, Yao believes many
people may be waiting to shop until Friday because they have the
day off. In anticipation of this, most local shopping malls will be
open from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Westfield Shoppingtown Topanga reported overwhelmingly high
sales starting with last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really encouraging to see sales so strong the week before
Christmas. Our retailers said they are selling a lot and they're
still waiting for last-minute shoppers,'' marketing director Janine
Baker said. ``It's just really nice to see the center so full and
that people are buying.''
</P>
<P>
   Specialty retailers are likewise reporting a strong holiday
season.
</P>
<P>
   In its first year of operation, the Quilted Bear in Northridge
has had high traffic and sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our first year, so we don't have anything to compare
it to, but we're meeting all of our expectations,'' said Eliana
Rosinksi, co-owner of the store, which specializes in hand-crafted
items.
</P>
<P>
   Online sales are also exceeding holiday sales expectations.
Online market research firm Bizrate.com found an increase of 329
percent for the number of orders being placed to Web merchants
between Nov. 28 and Dec. 20. Of course, online sales still
represent only a minor fraction of all retail sales.
</P>
<P>
   Cybershopping started earlier than in-store buying, but peaked
early last week with shoppers fearing their online purchases would
not arrive in time for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   TeleCheck senior economic adviser William Ford said retailers
should have a very merry Christmas given the brisk pace of retail
spending, past shopping patterns and the extra shopping day.

   SAN JOSE _ The Kings came back to life Wednesday night. They
just didn't do it with a victory.
</P>
<P>
   After allowing 23 goals in three consecutive meltdowns, the
Kings were respectable in a 2-1 loss to the San Jose Sharks in
front of 17,483 at the San Jose Arena.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't euphoric in the post-game locker room, but they
weren't shellshocked either. The Kings know emotionally they have
regrouped, even though they face a potential fifth-consecutive loss
the day after Christmas against division-leading Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've played as bad as we've played the last three
games,'' coach Andy Murray said. ``There seems to be some sort of
penance that you've got to go through where you have to play a
couple of real solid games before you get your just rewards.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of it was the return of center Jozef Stumpel, who had
missed almost six weeks after abdominal surgery. Stumpel gave the
Kings the defense they have been lacking in 7-1, 8-3 and 8-4 losses
that dropped them into last place in the Pacific Division.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kings had no answer for the league's leading goal
scorer, Owen Nolan, who got his 26th on the power play midway
through the second period to give the Sharks a 2-1 lead. Even
though they held San Jose to just three shots in the third period,
Nolan's goal was enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is why he is one of the top power forwards in the game,''
said Rob Blake, who had nine shots on Sharks goalie Steve Shields.
``He was in control.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Stumpel left the lineup Nov. 5, the Kings were 9-3-3 and
among the top teams in the Western Conference. Stumpel is the final
member of the Kings top line to return from injuries this season.
His mood was up even though he and linemates Luc Robitaille and
Ziggy Palffy were held without a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little nervous at the beginning but after the first
shot I was fine,'' Stumpel said. ``Physically, I felt fine. I know
I'll even get sharper as time goes on and get even more into the
flow of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings will need it if they want to pick up some ground in
the Pacific Division, which has hit a snag lately. All five teams
would qualify if the playoffs started today.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose came in with three consecutive losses. The Coyotes had
dropped five of six before routing the Mighty Ducks on Wednesday in
Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings knew keeping the game close in the first period would
be critical to overcoming their slump. They had been outscored 13-1
in the opening period the past week.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Sharks scored the first goal on a wrist shot by
Vincent Damphousse with 9:42 left in the first, the Kings had shown
enough grit to start rebuilding their confidence.
</P>
<P>
   They killed off two penalties, got their forwards to play
defense and even got a couple of shots in a short-handed situation
midway through the period.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear that the mental fatigue was gone,'' said Bryan
Smolinski, who scored the Kings only goal. ``That was just a mental
breakdown by an entire team. We showed we're through that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was not all great. On the Sharks' first goal,
defensemen Aki Berg and Frantisek Kaberle collided in front of the
net, giving Damphousse an open look. He fired a 15-footer over the
right shoulder of Kings goal tender Stephane Fiset.
</P>
<P>
   But as they had done early in the season, the Kings sent a
message late in the period when Smolinski rebounded a blast by Glen
Murray with 1:03 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings caught a break at the other end when the Sharks' were
pressuring Fiset. Stephane Matteau took a shot from a bad angle
that struck Smolinski's skate and shot out to center ice.
</P>
<P>
   Murray picked up the puck, crossed the San Jose blue line and
let go a slap shot. Shields made the first stop, but Smolinski was
trailing the play and fired in the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   It was the ninth goal of the season for Smolinski, who is among
the league leaders with 33 points in 34 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a fluke I guess,'' Smolinski said. ``We haven't seen much
of that lately.''

UCLA UPSET IN HAWAII
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAIE, Hawaii _ It's a bit early in the season for teams to
establish identities, but UCLA's fingerprints are already
unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
   Let the Bruins run, and watch 'em have fun. Play them slow, and
watch 'em implode.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado State became the latest team to exploit UCLA's
half-court woes, using a Gonzaga-esque game plan to upset the
Bruins 55-54 Wednesday night in the semifinals of the Pearl Harbor
Classic.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (5-2) trailed by nine points at halftime and seven
with three minutes left. But their frenzied rally fell short when
freshman forward Jason Kapono missed a 3-pointer from the left
corner at the buzzer sounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to play at a slower tempo,'' Colorado State coach
Ritchie McKay said. ``The higher the score against UCLA, the less
likely your chances of winning. We wanted to slow the tempo but
stay aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how much of his strategy was culled from videotape of
UCLA's loss to Gonzaga, McKay said: ``A lot.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA, which has not won an in-season tournament since 1990, will
play the loser of the South Florida-San Jose State in the
consolation game today.
</P>
<P>
   The chaotic final minutes made the game seem closer than it was.
Colorado State dominated with a well-designed man-to-man defense
that forced UCLA into 37.7 percent shooting. The Rams also used
near-flawless judgment on offense. They refused to take bad shots,
and they forced the Bruins to play defense for 25-30 seconds per
possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were well-coached,'' UCLA guard Earl Watson said. ``They
had a game plan, and they stuck to it. They played solid, and they
stayed within the team concept.''
</P>
<P>
   McKay liked his chances on the frontline with versatile forward
Ceedric Goodwyn (18 points) and athletic center John Ford (five
blocks). His perimeter defense was not designed to stop Watson _
UCLA's point guard and most experienced player _ but rather Kapono,
whose passing and decision-making are crucial to UCLA's attack.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, as Kapono struggled (2 of 11 shooting, one assist)
so did the Bruins. They made one basket in the final eight minutes
of the first half as the Rams turned a 17-17 tie into a 29-20
halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real discouraged, because we played some of our best
basketball of the season in the second half,'' Bruins coach Steve
Lavin said. ``But because we played so poorly in the first, we
weren't able to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins played the first half against Colorado State like
they played the second against Maine on Tuesday night _ with a
mixture of lethargy and sloppiness. They played like they expected
to win, utterly confident they'd impose their frenetic,
fast-breaking will on Colorado State.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was the Bruins who wilted.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams were better coached, they were better prepared and, for
37 minutes, they were much the better team. They didn't sit back in
a zone defense; they played a tight man-to-man. They pushed the
fast break, but only when opportunities existed. They moved the
ball quickly, mostly by passing, but they did not take bad shots.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, they maintained superb court balance and limited
UCLA's fast break. The Bruins rarely got easy baskets _ and that's
always a bad sign for a team that struggles to execute its
half-court offense.
</P>
<P>
   To compensate, UCLA tightened its defense as the second half
unfurled, and Colorado State briefly lost its composure. One errant
shot became a highlight play when Watson, leading the fast break,
threw an off-the-backboard pass to Jerome Moiso for a thunder dunk
that trimmed CSU's lead to 38-36.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the best dunks I've ever seen,'' McKay said.
``I thought we were losing momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rams quickly steadied themselves. Guard John Sivesand
followed Moiso's dunk with a 3-pointer, then Ford tipped home a
miss. Soon, the Rams had reclaimed a nine-point lead, and UCLA was
forced to scramble.
</P>
<P>
   The last-minute rally began with Dan Gadzuric's lay-up. Rico
Hines' free throws narrowed the deficit to 54-51. After a Colorado
State turnover, UCLA guard Ray Young buried a 3-pointer from the
right wing to tie the score.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had a chance to take the lead with a minute
remaining, but Kapono missed a difficult, left-handed shot from
close range. Ford made one of two free throws, setting up Kapono's
last, errant chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We showed our inconsistency,'' Watson said. ``We can't base
the game on the last play, because for the 39 minutes before, we
played terrible.''

 &HT;    Inn by the Sea a perfect fit for relaxing Naples
 &HT;    By Mary Thurwachter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPLES, Fla. _ What I love about Naples is how people there
appreciate a good sunset. A half hour before the sun goes down the
march to the sea commences.
</P>
<P>
   Old folks lug tattered beach chairs and crystal wine glasses
from nearby homes.
</P>
<P>
   Young folks pedal bicycles across the sand.
</P>
<P>
   Middle-aged fitness fans jog along the shoreline. A gaggle of
kids follow, pointing at birds and covering their eyes to avoid the
glare.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd gathers at the city pier and yet it's so quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Watching it reminds me of a scene in the Nicolas Cage-Meg Ryan
movie, City of Angels, where the angels meet at the beach at
sunrise to listen to the music of the spheres.
</P>
<P>
   No sphere music to be heard here. Clumsy-looking pelicans
crashing into the waves for fish provide what little noise there
is. You can't help but feel at peace.
</P>
<P>
   And peace is always a good feeling after a tiring afternoon of
gallery hopping and shopping on Fifth Avenue and Third Street
South.
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense that people in Naples would honor something as
beautiful as the setting sun. Clearly, they enjoy handsome artwork
_ there are no less than 31 art galleries in the city. Many are
around Fifth Avenue and Third Street South.
</P>
<P>
   Both tony shopping areas are within easy walking distance of Inn
by the Sea, the bed-and-breakfast my husband and I visited.
</P>
<P>
   Lest you be misled by its moniker, the inn isn't on the
shoreline, but three short blocks away _ close enough for a walk or
bike ride.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1937, the five-room inn, one of Naples' first guest
houses, is on the National Register of Historic Places. It has a
tin roof, wooden cove siding, ceiling fans and brass and iron beds
and yellow pine floors and ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   We stayed in one of the two upstairs rooms, the Bokeelia Suite.
(Rooms are named after barrier islands. Others are Gasparilla,
Sanibel, Captiva and Keewaydin.) Painted pale yellow, the walls in
our suite had pink, blue and yellow floral wallpaper borders. There
were tropical watercolor prints on the walls, wooden blinds on the
windows, and several baskets of sea shells placed around the suite.
The sitting room had a day bed, wicker chair and coffee table.
</P>
<P>
   While cozy, we found the quarters a tad confining and we didn't
like having to go across the hall to use the bathroom, which was so
tiny we could barely close the door without scraping the sink.
</P>
<P>
   But we had a good time at the Inn by the Sea, partly because we
met some fun folks in the living room and talked for hours, and
partly because the place has plenty of old Florida charm. The
ceramic fish on the sidewalk at the house's entrance was cute and
we loved the backyard orange tree, ripe and ready for picking. The
citrus fragrance alone enchanted us.
</P>
<P>
   Engaging, too, were the inn's owners, Maas and Connie van den
Top, who bought the place a few months ago. Connie, a former art
dealer who lived in Paris for several years, and Maas, from
Holland, give the place a bit of international flair.
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast, served in the dining room, included orange juice,
rolls, muffins, cereal, yogurt and fresh fruit. The only
disappointment was that with all those ripe oranges outside, the
juice came from a carton.
</P>
<P>
   But otherwise, this little B&AMP;B was a great place to get some
R&AMP;R.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   Inn by the Sea, 287 11th Ave. S., Naples. Phone: (941) 649-4124.
</P>
<P>
   Directions: From West Palm Beach, go south on I-95 to I-75. Take
I-75 (Alligator Alley) west to exit 15. Bear left onto County Road
951 to Davis Boulevard (State Road 84) and turn right. When it
ends, turn right on U.S. 41. Follow signs to downtown. Take Fifth
Avenue to Third Street and turn left (south) to 11th Avenue South.
Inn is on the corner of Third Street and 11th Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Accommodations: Five guest rooms, all with private baths,
although the upstairs rooms have detached bathrooms. Breakfast in
the dining room included.
</P>
<P>
   Rates: From Dec. 14-April 18, rooms range from $149-$189.
</P>
<P>
   Some good places to eat outdoors: Campiello, a fairly new
Italian eatery at 1177 Third St. S.; and Tommy Bahama's Tropical
Cafe, a fun place for lunch and shopping (there's a clothing store
attached)  Third St. S.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: What does an American look like?
 &HT;    (For release Dec. 26, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal authorities, concerned that this year-end will foment
worldwide (and domestic) terrorism against Americans, make this
suggestion: When overseas, try not to look too American.
</P>
<P>
   This is an interesting concept but one that is out of season.
</P>
<P>
   In summer, many Americans are easy to spot; usually, the men
wear Bermuda shorts, calf-length black socks and white sneakers _
along with a baseball-style cap.
</P>
<P>
   But in the winter? Say at this time? A good terrorist will have
to listen closely to people to hear an American accent, as the
tourists are bundled up just like the natives.
</P>
<P>
   Short of the guy in the Bermuda shorts and black socks,
Americans often are difficult to spot because the U.S. likely has
the most diverse population in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Americans look Hispanic, Americans look Italian, Americans look
African, Americans look Oriental, Americans look Semitic, Americans
look Nordic; you get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the Ugly American reputation that has followed us all
these decades of the 20th century is based more on activity rather
than attire. Maybe the suggestion should have been that we try to
not ACT like Americans overseas, because many do _ especially those
who plod on and off tour buses for the obligatory three-minute
visits to the Louvre, the Vatican or the Acropolis.
</P>
<P>
   There's a longstanding stereotyping wisecrack, to wit: How can
you tell the difference between a Japanese tourist and a Chinese
tourist? Answer: The Japanese tourist is the one with the camera
around his neck.
</P>
<P>
   I'm certain there is something similar about the American
tourist, likely an image of the guy in the black socks, but the
conundrum facing the would-be terrorist is whether the guy with the
camera around his neck is a Japanese Japanese or a
Japanese-American. Is the lady speaking French a French French
lady, or is she a French-American?
</P>
<P>
   We think we stick out as Americans wherever we go, yet if we
dress other than outlandishly and keep our voices down to a simple
shout, we should blend in fairly well with much of the world's
population. That's because most of us have hyphenated credentials,
as in Greek-American, or German-American.
</P>
<P>
   The detention of Japanese-Americans during our war with Japan
has had a history of infamy, in this case not because they looked
American but because they looked Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   And if an American is difficult to spot overseas, just think of
the confusion that goes on in this country where myriad languages
are spoken by U.S. citizens. The danger, beyond terrorism, is that
one kind of American becomes suspicious of another kind of American
simply because that person looks different; also a terrorism of a
kind. This stereotyping must be avoided in our quest to make our
own country safe from terrorism, lest we repeat what we did to
Japanese-Americans in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   In my morning jaunt in the park each day, I am passed by women
speaking Farsi (the language of Iran), by two couples going at it
in Chinese (I know this because I see them often in the
neighborhood Chinese restaurant), by many speaking Spanish. Rather
than the Tower of Babel, it is the Pathway of Babel.
</P>
<P>
   The other night, at a sports event, we were seated next to four
men who were speaking a language that I could not identify beyond
Eastern European. Finally, I asked one of them what language he was
speaking. Romanian, he responded. ``Where in Romania do you live?''
I asked just to appear interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``No Romania,'' he answered. ``Detroit.''
</P>
<P>
   The man, like so many of us, is a hyphenated American, a
Romanian-American. Is there something about that I should suspect?
</P>
<P>
   We are black, white and olive-skinned. Despite the few obnoxious
among us, if we act as ordinary as the natives of whatever country
we're in, we won't stick out as American.
</P>
<P>
   There is appropriate concern about terrorism, particularly
overseas. And there are cautions we must follow. But the idea that
any American can be singled out simply by ``looking'' American is a
stretch. We are too diversified.
</P>
<P>
   Just keep the camera in your pocket and the black calf-length
socks back in the hotel room.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: HACKING INTO THE NEW MILLENNIUM
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Dec. 26.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's Y2K czar, John Koskinen, has
asked computer hackers to stand down around the first of the year
because ``we are going to have enough things going on that
weekend'' without their added input.
</P>
<P>
   But the FBI and the Defense Department doubt that determined
intruders will honor Koskinen's request. Both agencies have warned
of potential New Year's cyber-attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Such warnings make news because the long-heralded ``network of
networks'' we know as the Internet has finally emerged as a true
mass communications medium. Upwards of 140 million people, 100
million of them in the United States, now have regular access to
online facilities. There are more than 4 million commercial sites
on the World Wide Web; their number grows at an exponential rate.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of Internet will radically change how we shop, play and
work in the new millennium. What won't change is some people's
desire to challenge authority or to vent their curiosity along
illegal paths.
</P>
<P>
   The architecture of the Internet permits hackers to ``bomb''
selected sites. The sites fail in much the same way as an emergency
911 service would fail if a thousand calls were placed at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   It's also not hard for hackers to capture Internet addresses and
spoof them. A few years ago, after the home page of the Central
Intelligence Agency was hacked by a Swedish group, visitors were
greeted by a message that read: ``Welcome to the Central Stupidity
Agency.''
</P>
<P>
   But most cyber-cops aren't stupid. Within a day, the FBI tracked
down a Florida teenager who had sent threatening e-mail to a
student at Colorado's Columbine High School, still recovering from
a mass murder. The alleged offender, who faces serious federal
charges, would have been harder to find had he used an anonymous
remailer in, say, Finland.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, merely reading a New Year's e-mail message couldn't
spawn a computer virus, although that's recently changed with
``bubbleboy,'' a self-executing virus that does no serious harm. In
any event, the worst thing that can happen to you is a wholesale
loss of data on an infected computer, all of which can be recovered
so long as prudent backup procedures are in place.
</P>
<P>
   People who run espionage networks, nuclear missile sites and
electric power grids use another means to safeguard them against
cyberattacks: they decouple ``mission-critical'' computers from the
Internet. Meantime, other government agencies are busy devising
ways to wage cyber-warfare against future potential enemies who
might lack the sense to protect themselves.
</P>
<P>
   My employer bars all but a favored few from accessing e-mail
messages from beyond the closed corporate network. That rule
defeats a central tenet of the Internet: the ability to reach any
server from any other server.
</P>
<P>
   The company's security mavens fear that granting the staff
permission to use e-mail at, say, at an airport kiosk, might permit
a hacker to penetrate their firewall and thereby plant a phony news
story or mess up the payroll.
</P>
<P>
   It's a legitimate concern. But the risk would go way if the
``post office'' were moved outside the firewall. While that's easy
to do, it's not a high priority for cybergate guardians at the dawn
of a century with a full quota of both hi-tech risks and promises.

 &HT;    Far-fetched, far-flung facts
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Do you believe everything you read? After
perusing this list of ``little known facts'' e-mailed to me by a
friend, I have to admit some of these items are a little
far-fetched. But then again, the same can be said about astrology
and wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   You be the judge. Here are some facts you may have never known
until now:
</P>
<P>
   A Saudi Arabian woman can get a divorce if her husband doesn't
give her coffee.
</P>
<P>
   A shark can detect one part of blood in 100 million parts of
water.
</P>
<P>
   The 57 on Heinz ketchup bottle represents the number of
ingredients in the sauce.
</P>
<P>
   A rat can last longer without water than a camel.
</P>
<P>
   Your stomach has to produce a new layer of mucus every two weeks
otherwise it will digest itself.
</P>
<P>
   The dot over the letter ``i'' is called a tittle.
</P>
<P>
   A raisin dropped in a glass of fresh champagne will bounce up
and down continually from the bottom of the glass to the top.
</P>
<P>
   A person cannot taste food unless it is mixed with saliva. For
example, if a strong-tasting substance like salt is placed on a dry
tongue, the taste buds will not be able to taste it. As soon as a
drop of saliva is added and the salt is dissolved, however, a
definite taste sensation results. This is true for all foods.
</P>
<P>
   A male emperor moth can smell a female emperor moth up to seven
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   George Washington grew marijuana in his garden.
</P>
<P>
   Some insects can live up to a year without their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Miles had the shortest performance ever nominated for an
Oscar with ``Midnight Cowboy.'' Her entire role lasted only six
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   A female ferret will die if it goes into heat and cannot find a
mate.
</P>
<P>
   Forty percent of McDonald's profits come from the sales of Happy
Meals.
</P>
<P>
   Every person has a unique tongue print.
</P>
<P>
   The ``spot'' on 7UP comes from its inventor who had red eyes. He
was albino.
</P>
<P>
   Every night, wasps bite into the stem of a plant, lock their
mandibles (jaws) into position, stretch out at right angles to the
stem, and, with legs dangling, fall asleep.
</P>
<P>
   During the chariot scene in ``Ben Hur'' a small red car can be
seen in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   Einstein couldn't speak fluently when he was nine. His parents
thought he might be retarded.
</P>
<P>
   On average, 12 newborns are given to the wrong parents daily.
</P>
<P>
   John Wilkes Booth's brother once saved the life of Abraham
Lincoln's son.
</P>
<P>
   Leonardo da Vinci could write with one hand and draw with the
other at the same time.

 &HT;    Remembering Father at Christmas
 &HT;    By Mary Schulken
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ She learned to dance on Daddy's wingtip toes,
clutching gray wool pants, face buried in an itchy shirt that
smelled of woodsmoke, Skin Bracer and whiskey.
</P>
<P>
   Around the hardwood floor they lurched, laughing, in the glow of
colored lights from the tree, while Mitch Miller sang about mommy
kissing Santa Claus, and Spike Jones wished for his two front
teeth.
</P>
<P>
   She a scrawny tomboy with ponytail and cowboy boots. He a
thick-middled man with a square jaw, glasses and day-old shadow on
his cheeks. The dancing would go on for a while. It was Christmas
Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Around and around they whirled, to the silly songs that were
their favorites. In the fireplace limbs from the big oak popped as
flames licked the lichens from dry bark. The dancing stopped only
when the record did and they paused to choose another. He was
breathless; she was eager to go on, and as happy as she can ever
remember.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, a Christmas moon turned fields and woods white against
the darkness. Soon they would walk, little hand and big hand, into
that night, under the big oak, and pause to examine odd marks in
the dirt he gravely said were made by hooves. When he pointed to
the sky, she could see it, the tiny dot across the moon, and hear
the tinkling of a bell.
</P>
<P>
   She could hear it later, too, from the foot of her bed, looking
out the window at an expectant sky, deaf to his footfalls one room
away as he put together swingsets and bicycles, and propped up baby
dolls.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost all she has of him now, those memories. That, and
the way the letters of his name are warm to the touch on a sunny
day where they are carved into granite. She was a girl when he went
away. She was a woman before she missed enough of what she lost to
grieve.
</P>
<P>
   The father, she knew. The man, she did not.
</P>
<P>
   The father rescued her kitten from the falling-down outhouse,
coaxing it to safety before the floor gave way and plunged him into
the heart of darkness in his shorty pajamas.
</P>
<P>
   The man went to war instead of college, came home to parents who
needed him and a woman he had loved four years long distance. Some
nights, he pounded his fists on the kitchen table. Brown liquid
from a bottle carried him to a place it took her years to
understand.
</P>
<P>
   She wonders what he would think now about the grown woman whose
face so bears his likeness in cheekbone and expression. Whose hands
are like his. Whose mind carries the same hard edge that made him a
man whose opinions were sought, even without a college education.
</P>
<P>
   He has not been here for so much of her life.
</P>
<P>
   But he is here on brittle December nights, when a moon lights
each bare branch, and limbs clatter with a frosty breeze.
</P>
<P>
   He is here, in the latest rockabilly crooning about Santa, or in
the faintest jingle of a holiday bell.
</P>
<P>
   He is here every Christmas Eve, squiring her around the room
with his feet, and laughing.
</P>
<P>
   It is an ordinary thing for fathers to dance daughters on their
toes, to leave the print of reindeer hooves in the dust of a
driveway, to point at a moonlit sky, inspiring hopes as bright as
the star of Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
   But the memories of those things are not ordinary. They are not
like swingsets, baby dolls or bicycles.
</P>
<P>
   They do not wear out with use, or gather dust as time goes by.

 &HT;    Holiday tome still gives the answers
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ The Encyclopaedia Britannica may have
moved from bicep-building bindings to airy blips of digital data
but a few reference works remain that can be aimlessly browsed by
the fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   I speak here of ``The Big Book of Christmas and Christmaslike
Phenomena.'' Brought out of the Christmas box for another year of
reference, its duct-taped spine still supple, the book remains a
font of holiday lore.
</P>
<P>
   You'd look in vain to find such patient expositions of the
season's mysteries anywhere else. Consider these sample entries:
</P>
<P>
   ANIMAL CAROLING _ Technological advances now allow mankind to
hear holiday songs performed in animal sounds. First barking dogs
singing ``Jingle Bells'' then cats, chirping birds and llamas (''A
Very Inca Christmas'' Fourth World Records, 1982). Legislative bans
found unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``BLUE CHRISTMAS'' _ ``The greatest song the mind of man has yet
composed'' _ M.R. ``Bob'' Carmellow, ``A Tear in the Eggnog:
Studies in Holiday Melancholia.''
</P>
<P>
   CASH REGISTER BELLS ARE JINGLING _ Still, the No. 1 Christmas
journalism cliche even though the last documented cash register
with a jingling bell was retired in 1992. See ``optimistic
merchants'' under ``Christmas Journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``CHRISTIANS AND THE PAGANS'' _ Dar Williams' song is unique for
taking on the teeth-gritting tensions of holiday religious
differences. Wiccans and Christians manage dinner and family truce.
The editors prefer this even to John Prine's ``Christmas in
Prison,'' which remains the No. 1, penal-theme Christmas song.
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTMAS WREATH IN A CAN _ See ``Notable Holiday Marketing
Failures.''
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTMAS HAIKU _ The winner of this year's Christmas Haiku
Contest:
</P>
<P>
   Who is Pokeman?
</P>
<P>
   And why am I fighting for
</P>
<P>
   Cards in Japanese?
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTMAS TREE, PERFECTLY STRAIGHT _ See ``Christmas
Mythology.''
</P>
<P>
   ELECTO-TREE _ Although this product was a useful tool for
training cats to respect holiday decorations, civil-liability
issues halted its manufacture.
</P>
<P>
   FOURTH WISE MAN _ Variously identified as Zeppo, Pete Best and
Shemp. An oddly persistent Christmas legend, which, like the rubber
cigar, is without scriptural basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``IT IS IRONIC AT THIS TIME OF GOODWILL TOWARD MAN ...'' _ See
``Top 10 TV-News Lead-Ins'' under ``Christmas Journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   LANDSAT RULE _ The Landsat Rule states that outdoor Christmas
decorations are excessive if they show up in routine satellite
photos or confuse aircraft navigation.
</P>
<P>
   NEXT CHRISTMAS _ A mythical time when trees slip into their
stands and children are happy, clean and grateful. Teen-agers stay
home, children get their lines right in the pageant and everyone in
the photograph has his or her eyes open. Cards are mailed on time.
Credit is used responsibly. The last present is wrapped on Dec. 20
and everything is neatly boxed, labeled and stored by Jan. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ORIENTAR (or-EE-en-TAR) _ When asked ``Where were the Three
Kings from?'' 80 percent of respondents say ``Orientar.'' Two
percent motion somewhere down the street.
</P>
<P>
   ORNAMENT-HOOK BALLS _ Nobody knows why metal Christmas ornament
hooks entwine themselves into balls while in storage. Mental health
professionals urge you to spend 98 cents on new hooks rather than
attempting to undo them. Spray-paint the mass and hang it on the
tree.
</P>
<P>
   REINDEER GAMES _ Their exact nature remains obscure. Lack of
opposable thumbs would seem to rule out ``Tomb Raider.''
</P>
<P>
   VIRGINIA _ The best-known newspaper editorial in the history of
journalism appeared in the New York Sun in 1897. It was not about
peace or justice. It did not expose corruption. It assured a little
girl named Virginia that Santa Claus lives. The public has received
editorial page assurances with a degree of skepticism ever since.

 &HT;    Ted Kennedy, senator of the century
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ He is aging, rumpled and overweight. His family
has suffered hurts, embarrassments and cruel deaths. But Ted
Kennedy is still pushing hard for America's old, young, infirm and
downtrodden.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, now 67, has been senator from Massachusetts since his
election in 1962 at the minimum constitutional age of 30. In the
years since, he has been trying incessantly to make the American
government help its people who cannot help themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Former Texas Lt. Gov. Ben Barnes introduced him at a recent
Austin fund-raiser as ``the senator of the century,'' who
``particularly in the area of human rights and equal opportunity
has had greater impact ... than even many presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``America appreciates so much what you've done for those without
a voice,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, up for re-election next year, is also the target of
much venom from those who think he's the poster child for amoral,
baby-killing, tax-loving, big-government liberals who will destroy
the country. He's the bogeyman that conservative Republicans, and
particularly their direct-mail fund-raisers, love to hate.
</P>
<P>
   But the combination of his famous family history and his
longtime advocacy for liberal causes allows Kennedy to draw a
devoted crowd of Democrats anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stand for education,'' Kennedy told 200 Democrats at a
fund-raiser Dec. 10 at Austin's Capitol Marriott Hotel. ``We stand
to try to include a fount of opportunity and hope for people in
this country.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Boston-Austin axis was created with the 1960 Democratic
ticket of John Kennedy and Texan Lyndon Johnson, it made access to
college a battleground against the GOP ticket headed by Richard
Nixon, Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson believed that every young
person ought to be able to gain entrance to any college that they
were qualified to enter,'' Kennedy said. After the election, the
program was structured to have three-fourths of the aid in the form
of grants _ to avoid the ``very significant kinds of debts which
they have today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk to any of the children at any of the (graduate) schools,
and you will find out that any time that they have a recess, that
they're talking about their debts, rather than talking about the
books that they're reading and should be learning about in their
classrooms,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who sponsored the Family and Medical Leave Act that
President Bush vetoed but President Clinton later signed, chaired
the Senate committee that oversees health and human services from
1987 until the Republicans took back the Senate in 1994. Since
then, he has largely played defense, trying to protect Medicare and
Medicaid and opposing Republican changes in labor laws.
</P>
<P>
   While crediting Texas with allowing remedies against health
maintenance organizations, Kennedy said the battle is still to be
fought nationally to ensure ``that we're going to have the doctors
and the trained personnel that are treating patients making the
medical decisions, and not accountants for the major industries in
this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, he said, ``stand for decent health care, quality
health care, expanding health care _ for working families in this
country, and for the senior citizens. ... And we're not going to
let the Republicans undermine that.''
</P>
<P>
   Texan Bob Mann, Kennedy's press secretary in the mid-1980s who
now teaches news writing at the University of Texas at Austin, was
impressed at Kennedy's stamina a dozen years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has enormous resilience,'' Mann said. ``Although he's now
pushing 70, he has maintained his idealism. He still gets to the
root of a problem and sees hypocrisy _ like senators who voted for
a $4,600-a-year pay raise for themselves, but against a 50-cent an
hour raise in the minimum wage for a single mother with three
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``He continues to represent those nobody else does: the poor,
the elderly, the young, the minorities, the sick, those who do not
have people in Washington looking after them,'' Mann said. ``And
his resilience in doing that, in spite of the loss of family member
after family member, in spite of losing some political battles, is
just amazing.''

 &HT;    This is the way world ends: Mad dash to next time zone
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Forget the computers.
</P>
<P>
   We should know the true significance of Y2K by watching Dibble
Glacier.
</P>
<P>
   If in fact the new year has any significance beyond a few coffee
makers spewing calve's blood, the glacier will tell us. For if the
world ends at the stroke of 2000, it ends starting right there.
</P>
<P>
   And if if does, a lot of people will be hurrying west and
rapidly praying.
</P>
<P>
   They'll have an hour, eight, 12, to make right with the heavenly
landlord, or buy time racing the sun before the sifter separates
wheat from chaff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Father, who art in New Zealand. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Dibble Glacier is on the Antarctic rim. No computers, just ice.
It does have a sunrise, which is a distinction. Most of Antarctica
has no sunset in December.
</P>
<P>
   The permanently inhabited place that will have the first sunrise
of 2000 is Kahuitara Point on Pitt Island, one of New Zealand's
Chatham Islands.
</P>
<P>
   It will happen while Americans slumber on the morning of Dec.
31, 3:49 a.m. Texas time.
</P>
<P>
   The thing about the Y2K computer threat is that by the time it
reaches America the world will be half disrupted already.
</P>
<P>
   Or not.
</P>
<P>
   On even more pressing matters, if the sum of Earth's insisting
has convinced even God to believe the hype that millennia converge
on the stroke of 2000 (they don't) _ or if God decides to jettison
the whole party just to show us who's in charge ...
</P>
<P>
   The way Y2K arrives on the globe means that while we sleep the
morning before the big night, The End already will have begun in
some time zones.
</P>
<P>
   All of us will know when we awake on New Year's Eve morning. Al
Roker will be able to tell us.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us will be able to count on our fingers how many hours
we have left in paradise, without a convincing appeal for a grace
period.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most Americans will be playing down the risks.
They'll assume that any mass depopulation starting in the South
Pacific and sweeping across Asia and Europe is one of those El Nino
things. Or La Nina. Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that will bring stark reality home would be
seeing Dick Clark wither under his top coat as the Times Square
ball drops.
</P>
<P>
   Bad example. Nothing withers Dick Clark. He will outlive all
planetary life.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a dangerously mortal president will be the coal-mine
canary, Armageddon-wise. If they see Bill Clinton deflate at the
stroke of 12 like a Bullwinkle float impaled on a street light,
Americans will know things are serious, state-side.
</P>
<P>
   But the good news is that except for those on the East Coast,
there will still be time to make things right. We just have to pray
real hard or run real fast.
</P>
<P>
   We've been hearing how monitoring the Y2K computer-time glitch,
time zone by time zone, will be like watching the Wave at your
local stadium.
</P>
<P>
   If Y2K is the end-of-time glitch, salvation-wise, it will be
played out in waves on west-bound interstates.
</P>
<P>
   West Texans in fear for their ever-afters will swarm New
Mexico's adobe chapels, where they'd have a whole extra hour to
save their souls.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush could use the time to dispatch Gideons to jammed
interstates to make futile flight fruitful. Or maybe he'll figure
he needs some chapel time for himself or a swift plane.
</P>
<P>
   When Y2K meets the West Coast, body surfers will be flailing
into the white caps to save their souls, literally.
</P>
<P>
   And in Hawaii, people will be frantic to catch the next flight
to Samoa. That's where the day will be done, the first day of 2000
on this planet. Or the last. Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   The glacier should tell us everything.

 &HT;    More ideas on giving books as Christmas gifts
 &HT;    By Jay Milner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Books for Christmas gifts deux:
</P>
<P>
   University presses are continuing to produce quality books of
the type and content that once came from regular trade publishing
houses. That was before just about every major and minor commercial
publisher was bitten by the Blockbuster Bug, meaning they decided
somewhere along the line to reject all books that they decided
would not be best sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Not every book published by these commercial publishers meet
that mark, of course. It's still a matter of judgement, luck, fate,
and who-knows-what-all that pushes a novel or nonfiction volume
into the blockbuster category. But publishers keep trying to make
their allegedly educated guesses confined to the Big Bucks Books,
which they continue to find is not even as easy to do as choosing
which movie will make it big at the box office. Certain movie stars
will pull a certain number of fans into the movie theaters, at
least for the first few days until word-of-mouth has time to make
the rounds.
</P>
<P>
   But we were talking about university presses, and books for
Christmas gifts to good friends and relatives. Here are a few
samples of what we mean:
</P>
<P>
   One discussed here not long ago is Larry L. King's hefty book of
letters titled ``A Life in Letters, or Reflections From a Bloodshot
Eye,'' (Texas Christian University Press). This one is a lot of fun
to read and is informative about the life and times of a writer.
</P>
<P>
   King, the one who writes for a living, not the guy on TV, is a
West Texas native who moved to Washington, D.C., some years ago to
tub thump for a West Texas congressman but sometime in the 1960s
decided to chuck all the benefits and safety nets provided a
congressional assistant and devote full time to writing. Friends
called him crazy, for that and other reasons, but the husky,
aggressive rascal made a go of it and then some.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote several books but his greatest success was, and is, the
Broadway hit he co-wrote called ``The Best Little Whorehouse in
Texas.'' He has made millions from that effort.
</P>
<P>
   But one doesn't have to be a writer or even interested in
writing and writers to enjoy King's book of letters, written to
friends, relatives, business associates and enemies over the years.
(There are even several to yours truly and other names you will no
doubt recognize, some are celebrities and some aren't.)
</P>
<P>
   If you have friends or relatives living in West Texas, or once
lived out there in what used to be call The Great American Desert,
a fine gift might be a new release by the Texas Tech Press titled
``West Texas: A Portrait of its People and Their Raw and Wondrous
Land'' by Mike Cochran and John Lumpkin.
</P>
<P>
   What we have here is one of those coffee table books with plenty
of gorgeous photographs to go with the text written by two veteran
newspapermen _ Cochran covered West Texas for The Associated Press
for nearly 40 years and Lumpkin is currently AP Bureau Chief for
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A foreword is written by John T. Montford, president of Texas
Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's a really dandy University of North Texas reprint in
hardback by the creator of the popular series, ``Hank, the
Cowdog,'' about life as a cowboy titled ``Panhandle Cowboy,'' with
a foreword by Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Larry McMurtry, who,
by the way, has a new book of essays out that would make a fine
Christmas gift titled ``Walter Benjamin at the Dairy Queen.''
McMurtry, the author of ``Lonesome Dove'' and other best-selling
novels, chats informally about his life growing up in Archer City,
Texas, growing famous as a writer and learning to cope with a heart
attack, among other human things. This is one of my favorite books
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   And we mustn't forget that fascinating nonfiction ``Confessions
of Mad Dog'' by Jay Dunston Milner. It's a University of North
Texas Press release.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Milner writes for Cox Newspapers.

 &HT;    Home for the holidays and a spot of cash
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ My daughters came home from college last
week, eager for a break from the rigors of studying, attending
University of Texas football games, and staying up far too late on
weekends doing . . . well, I don't want to know. Let's not go
there, as they say.
</P>
<P>
   Being a father, the first question out of my mouth is, ``So, how
did you do this semester?'' Kasey, the oldest, proudly proclaimed
she had once again made all A's, which means she's headed into her
final semester of undergraduate work with a 3.96 or so average. Two
B's in three-and-half-years, the rest A's. She's such an
overachiever.
</P>
<P>
   Kasey has a terrific work ethic, which she inherited from her
mother (who graduated in three years), and she has the ability to
work long hours, party too late, and then get up and study for a
test, a talent she got from me.
</P>
<P>
   OK, she didn't get the last part from me. I would work long
hours and stay up way too late discussing philosophy over a case of
generic beer. Remember generic beer? You could buy it at Kroger. It
just said ``BEER'' in black type on a white background and cost
$1.39 a six pack. Generic beer was brewed by Pearl, meaning I guess
that it was the bottom of the vat, down where the sediment sinks _
Pearl beer not exactly being a premium brew anyway. After the first
half-dozen cans, it really wasn't that bad, at least from the
perspective of a dirt-poor college student who used to sell plasma
for gas money.
</P>
<P>
   My trouble was, I could work long hours and party late, but I
generally didn't follow through on the studying part. I remember
more than a few classes in which my attendance was spotty enough
that the professor didn't recognize me when I showed at office
hours to try to catch up. I didn't make bad grades, graduating in
four-and-a-half years with a GPA a tad over a `B' average, the
beneficiary of laid-back instructors and friends who took good
notes. But there wasn't any ``cum laude'' written after my name,
not that it mattered much since I always knew I'd end up
newspapering anyhow. What mattered in that line of work was, well,
the ability to work long hours and party late.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Goose, the youngest daughter, who is finishing her
first semester at UT. Goose looks just like her mother but has the
same scholastic willpower I had _ in other words, not much. She
took a rugged course load her first semester of four courses and no
job, and finally confessed that best-case scenario was one A, two
B's and a C. Worst-case scenario, meaning what likely will happen,
is two B's and two C's.
</P>
<P>
   I asked what happened. She shrugged and said, ``I partied too
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened to ``The dog ate my homework,'' or, ``I
couldn't take the stress,'' or ``I'm dealing with some anxiety
issues right now?'' The child took a disarmingly honest approach
that left me a bit nonplussed. Kasey said she's going to enroll
Goose in a remedial course in how to deceive your parents, a course
in which Kasey graduated as valedictorian.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Kasey reports that Goose told her mother and stepfather
that she skipped too many classes. What's wrong with the child? Has
she not learned to lie? Good lord, she's in college, for pete's
sake, a time to stretch the boundaries, explore new frontiers _ and
make danged sure your parents never find out about it, at least as
long as you're still on their payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Her honesty forced me to deliver the stern-father lecture,
complete with the requisite threat about paying for one's own
college if things didn't improve. She promised to do better and
said this was all part of a master plan. She figured, she said,
that she could blow off the first semester and get it all out of
her system, then get serious the next go-round. Good story. Maybe
she is learning how to snow the parents.
</P>
<P>
   At least I had the advantage in my college career of being
solely in charge of paying for my own education, which meant I only
had to answer to myself for my slacker attitude.
</P>
<P>
   There's a thought. Maybe I'll offer to never bother her again
about her grades if she agrees to pay her own way through.
</P>
<P>
   What are the odds? She may not have the college-student parental
deception routine down quite right just yet, but she's no dummy.
Take the check, take the lecture, and take her chances that she'll
do better. I'm sure she will. If not, she can always go into the
newspaper business.

 &HT;    `First Lady of Beauty' aims to capture sights through photos
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Evelyn Lauder is a woman of diverse
passions.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed ``America's First Lady of Beauty,'' she's the senior
corporate vice president of the Estee Lauder companies, the
cosmetics empire founded by her mother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   She's the founder and president of the Breast Cancer Research
Foundation, which has handed out more than $13.5 million in grants
since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   A nature lover, she's a photographer of landscapes and outdoor
still lifes who donates the proceeds from her work to breast cancer
research.
</P>
<P>
   Lauder, 63, visited Palm Beach recently for the opening of an
exhibition of her photographs at the Chase Manhattan Private Bank.
The show will remain up through Jan. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a blue silk Oscar de la Renta suit, Lauder took time
out to offer her opinions...
</P>
<P>
   On photography: ``The creative process is so extraordinarily
exciting. I cannot stop. I need this for my soul.'' That's why she
packs her camera no matter where she and her husband, Leonard,
travel, whether it's to the base of a Venezuelan waterfall or to
the peaks of Colorado mountains.
</P>
<P>
   On her subject matter: ``It has a great deal to do with light
and how it plays off things,'' she says. ``It's just very
haphazard. If I see something beautiful, I grab it.'' Subjects in
her Chase Manhattan show include Indonesian fishing boats, Turkish
temples and 1950s Chevrolets in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   On her choice of camera: The Olympus IS30. ``It's a spectacular
camera that can do a great many things, but it's automatic.''
</P>
<P>
   On sun protection: Always a hat or baseball cap (''I have a
great straw hat that ties under my chin''). A caftan or long shirt
over her swimsuit (''Even if I'm snorkeling, I'm wearing a
T-shirt''). And two layers of sunscreen (Estee Lauder's Resilience
Lift cream with an SPF of 15, followed by a more traditional
sunscreen).
</P>
<P>
   On her favorite spot outdoors in New York City: The clean, green
sweep of Central Park, where she walks regularly with her husband.
(She's a board member of the Central Park Conservancy and the Parks
Council.)
</P>
<P>
   On getting everything done: ``I am so disorganized. I have such
a mess on my desk.'' She hires good help _ one whose sole job is
riding herd on the 2,000 Christmas cards Lauder sends to friends,
family and business associates.

   GALILEE _ MOUNT OF BEATITUDES, Israel _ A tour bus stopped on
the slope of the Mount of the Beatitudes to let passengers watch a
shepherd herding his sheep. Except for his leather jacket and khaki
pants, he could have stepped from a scene 2,000 years ago. These
are the images that bring the Bible to life for many people and the
reason they make the long trip to Israel. More than the churches
and monuments, it is the gentle hills, the silver-blue beauty of
the Sea of Galilee and the rushing water of the River Jordan that
draw people to Galilee. (Blackerby, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   MEGIDDO _ MEGIDDO, Israel _ When the final battle between good

Megiddo. Bastardized by the Greeks, this battlefield became known

   CAREER-BOOKS (Undated) _ A handful of the career books that come
out each year are so wonderful that I write about them right away;
most of the rest get discarded in a hurry. But there is a third
group: Some books are intriguing enough to be useful to some

dedicated ``All About My Mother'' to ``all actresses who have
played actresses, to men who act and become women, to all the

tribute that beautifully assesses the nature of facades. Once you

`SAM' A GEM FROM LEE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `SUMMER OF SAM'
</P>
<P>
   If Spike Lee directed glossy films with A-list stars like
Gwyneth Paltrow and strategic year-end release dates, perhaps he'd
be getting Oscar buzz now.
</P>
<P>
   But he doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   He does the right thing: He makes films for himself, not
tunnel-visioned Oscar voters, and his ``Summer of Sam'' is the
latest in a line of personal triumphs.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the Bronx, N.Y., in the sizzling summer of '77 _ when Lee
was coming of age in Brooklyn _ ``Sam'' recounts the grisly
lovers'-lane murders of David Berkowitz, who used the nickname
``Son of Sam.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's more about a vivid sense of time and place than serial
killings, a cliched movie device that in this rare case happens to
be based on fact.
</P>
<P>
   Berkowitz (played by ``The Practice's'' Michael Badalucco) is
simply another incendiary spark in the interlocked lives of
tumultuous young adults driven by the debauchery of the disco era.
Chief among them are a philandering hairdresser (John Leguizamo)
and his sweet waitress wife (Mira Sorvino).
</P>
<P>
   We also meet a crime lord (Ben Gazzara), a punk rocker (Adrien
Brody) and other neighborhood poseurs and toughs immersed in drugs,
sex and profane belligerence.
</P>
<P>
   As deaths mount, vigilante justice rears its head, with neighbor
suspecting neighbor, and with relationships already strained by
reckless hedonism nearing the breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   This is Lee's first film that does not address the black
experience; he plays the only prominent black character, an
amusingly deliberate TV reporter.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Sam'' does consider issues involving prejudice,
intolerance and being an outsider or scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   Be wary. This is not for everyone. It's a raw, harrowing,
gripping film that can be perversely amusing and brutally
sensational.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also a film with a strikingly original vision, an
indifference to Hollywood formula and a resounding sense of truth.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 4 stars.

<P>
   `AMERICAN PIE'
</P>
<P>
   What's the fuss? Even the unrated version of this notorious teen
comedy is about as daring as a routine ``Beavis &AMP; Butt-head''
episode _ and about as stupid.
</P>
<P>
   The premise involves randy teens looking for love in all the
wrong places on the eve of high school graduation. Four guys are
especially desperate to lose their virginity, though they just
might learn there's more to life.
</P>
<P>
   Gee, do you think? Stop me if you've heard this.
</P>
<P>
   The cast of largely unknowns tries mightily to elevate the
material above its witless self-gratification, yet they wallow in
cliches and gross-out gags.
</P>
<P>
   But give the film this: It refreshingly avoids the
mean-spiritedness _ if not hatefulness _ afflicting so many teen
tales. Its characters may be misguided, but they aren't wicked or
spiteful.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for all their sexual adventurism, they have a certain
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Is such a thing still allowed in high school?
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 2 stars.

</P>
<P>
   `RUN LOLA RUN'
</P>
<P>
   This boldly stylized German film hurls the alternate-path
premise of ``Sliding Doors'' in wildly divergent directions.
</P>
<P>
   Lola (Franka Potente), a young woman in Berlin, gets a frantic
call from her lover (Moritz Bleibtreu). He ran an errand for a
crime boss but lost the cash. He'll be dead in 20 minutes if he or
Lola don't find a fortune.
</P>
<P>
   This sends Lola racing to help,2and we see three drastically
different turns in her life, each hinging on slight variations on
her trip (a moment's delay can change everything).
</P>
<P>
   The film seems to cheer on its criminals, but Lola and her lover
are humanized in flashbacks, and her dedication is redeeming in
itself.
</P>
<P>
   It's also fun piecing together the plot, like a puzzle that
interlocks in different ways to form different visions. Methodical
in its bedQ%Qions yet bracingly accelerated in snap-shot narrative
moments, ``Lola'' is a harrowing yet rewarding ride.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 3 stars.

   `CITY' ROCKS ON DVD
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit Rock City'' is a rarity, if not a first: It arrives
this week on DVD three weeks before its Jan. 11 debut on VHS.
</P>
<P>
   Since the latter format remains home video's dominant medium,
the film's review in this space will wait until that time.

KALEIDOSCAPE: IT'S BACK TO THE BIG TOP FOR NEWEST SHOW ON EARTH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA MITCHELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Step through the giant O that serves as entry to Barnum's
Kaleidoscape and discover a world gone glad.
</P>
<P>
   In one corner of the luxurious lobby tent, a street urchin in a
patchwork dress and bright red boots teaches children how to
Hula-Hoop. Watching the lessons is a tuxedo-clad man, who holds his
petite partner in the palm of his hand, high above the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   A few feet away, tumblers amaze all with their flips and flops
as a zany British band belts out an energetic rendition of ``Has
Anybody Seen My Girl?''
</P>
<P>
   Onlookers wander from wonder to wonder, munching on gourmet
veggie wraps and Wolfgang Puck pizza bought from old-fashioned
circus wagons that circle the performers. A few settle into red
velvet sofas to gaze up at the kaleidoscope images dancing on the
tent's ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   And this is just the pre-show.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A RETURN TO TENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kaleidoscape made its world premiere last April in Los Angeles
and is on a 50-week tour.
</P>
<P>
   The $10 million production features 62 performers and unfolds
under tents, the first Ringling Bros. circus to do so since 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Feld, chairman and chief executive officer of Feld
Entertainment, is the creative force behind Kaleidoscape.
</P>
<P>
   The son of Irvin Feld _ who revitalized Ringling Bros. and
Barnum &AMP; Bailey Circus in the late '50s by moving the shows from
tents to more profitable venues such as arenas _ Feld envisioned a
one-ring, upscale circus that would appeal not only to traditional
circus lovers but to the theater-going crowd as well. Montreal's
Cirque du Soleil and others like it have proved that hybrid
audience exists.
</P>
<P>
   But Kaleidoscape is no mere Cirque wannabe. Critics across the
country have raved about the new show, and in many cities, runs
have been extended. The diverse audience includes the obvious
toddlers, parents and grandparents, plus teens, twentysomethings
and others who have heard about the show through word of mouth.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
LET THE FUN BEGIN &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fun actually begins one hour prior to show time. As
circusgoers approach the striking white-and-red tents, a group of
dancers welcomes them with fancy footwork and Moroccan music.
Inside, the elaborate pre-show is under way. Ticket-holders can
mingle with performers, have dinner or check out Kaleidoscape
merchandise that's for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Feld designed the circus to flow like a party. The pre-show, he
says, is a vital part of the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I invited somebody over to my house for a party, they'd
come to the front door and knock. They'd enter the living room,
have a drink and hors d'oeuvres, and get to know everybody,'' Feld
explains. ``The pre-show is the cocktail hour.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of their instruction, the Hula-Hooping children have
learned their colorfully dressed instructor's name _ Fanny _ and
that she's a ninth-generation circus performer from France.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THE MAIN EVENT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As show time nears, Feld's party guests begin to file through
the lighted tunnel that leads to the performance tent. The intimate
setting holds 1,850, and there's not a bad seat in the house. Red
velvet covers each chair, and those in the back row are only 52feet away from the middle of the ring. There are even VIP couches
scattered throughout.
</P>
<P>
   The lights dim to signal the start of the show. When they come
up, a bed sits at the center of the ring with award-winning clown
David Larible tucked inside. He awakens and begins preparing for
his day.
</P>
<P>
   Kaleidoscape has no ringmaster, and almost no dialogue. Instead,
Larible serves as host, ushering the show along with comedic bits
between acts.
</P>
<P>
   The curly-haired Italian became the first clown ever to headline
a Ringling Bros. circus, in 1991. He did so until 1998, when Feld
asked him to help create Kaleidoscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really the glue that holds the show together,'' Feld
says. ``I don't know if I would have done it at this time without
him.''
</P>
<P>
   As Larible sits at an empty makeup table, each of the show's
performers arrives onstage to help with his transformation.
Acrobats from the Hassani and the Bogino troupes juggle his tubes
of makeup before handing them off. The beautiful Vanessa Fisher, a
California girl who plays cello in the circus, climbs a rope to
rescue his big floppy shoes. And so on, until Pipo, a classic
European harlequin who plays Abbott to Larible's Costello, joins
him onstage. He hands Larible his red nose, and the show begins.
</P>
<P>
   The main performance is two hours and 10 minutes long, with a
20-minute intermission, and is accompanied by a live orchestra
performing an original score. The acts fly by.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Zerbini, a ninth-generation circus performer from
Florida, commands six white Arabian horses. Her cues are almost
invisible as the steeds change direction, stand on their hind legs
and race around the ring.
</P>
<P>
   After the animals exit, Sylvia the horse whisperer becomes
Sylvia the trapeze artist. She whips off her cape to reveal a sheer
costume with strategically placed sequins. She dazzles the audience
again with the second part of her act.
</P>
<P>
   Olga Rogacheva's time in the spotlight features the only other
animals in Kaleidoscape _ a flock of geese. A Siberian who has
performed throughout Europe for the past 10 years, Rogacheva
directs the geese here and there with help from Istvan Toth, her
27-inch-tall Hungarian sidekick. Audience members can't help but
fear for the diminutive man as the geese surround him at eye level.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can juggle using his hands. Picasso Jr. uses his mouth.
He spits pingpong balls 20 feet into the air one after the other,
catching them in his mouth only to send them flying back out.
</P>
<P>
   The circus' strongmen come in the form of the Golden Statues.
These Moroccan-born performers _ painted head to toe in gold paint,
their muscles bulging, and wearing the briefest of briefs _ bend in
unbelievable ways, forming human pyramids that leave audience
members with their jaws dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Raising the stress level in the tent is what perch artists Lucy
Kirilova and Alex Petrov of Bulgaria do best. On his forehead,
Petrov balances a 13-foot pole _ atop which Kirilova sits. Petrov
then walks across an inclined tightrope, never wavering despite his
load.
</P>
<P>
   Crossbow marksman Guy Tell can clip a long-stemmed rose from the
mouth of his partner, fellow Parisian Regina Bouglione, with his
arrow. His finale _ a 16-bow stunt that ends with him splitting an
apple that sits on top of his own head _ is the stunner, though.
</P>
<P>
   The other acts amaze, as well. Aerial swing artists the Kabanovs
wow the crowd with the greatest of ease. The tumbling troupes, the
Hassani and the Bogino, have every cheerleader in the room taking
notes.
</P>
<P>
   Nuts &AMP; Bolts, the wacky musical group heard in the lobby tent,
performs a silly set using a variety of instruments _ from watering
cans to the exhaust of a 1937 Rolls Royce.
</P>
<P>
   Larible returns to the ring between acts with Pipo to provide
comedic breaks from the artistic tension. He pulls audience members
into the ring for plate-throwing games or to act out operas only he
knows the plots to.
</P>
<P>
   The show ends with a grand finale, but we won't spill the
details here. Just expect all the small children in the audience to
run away and join the circus.

JUST CLOWNING AROUND 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA MITCHELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Larible understands why some people don't like clowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clown is very mistreated,'' says the Italian performer.
``There are some people who do it right. Americans can be excellent
clowns. Buster Keaton was a clown. The Marx Brothers were clowns.
They were artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``But suddenly, it turned. There is not professionalism. Anybody
can put makeup on, a wig, learn three or four tricks and say, `I'm
a clown.'
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Bozo, Ronald McDonald, the guy who comes to your
birthday party. That's not a clown. That's like saying a painter is
the guy who paints your walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people who hate clowns. They are frightened of them,
because of these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Larible studied mime, ballet and music at the Verona
Conservatory of Music and has the awards to prove he's the real
deal. He recently took home the Golden Clown Award, top prize at
the 1999 International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   There is one thing that bothers Larible almost as much as those
who clown around without the proper credentials _ the assumption
that Kaleidoscape is just like Cirque du Soleil.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the last thing we want to be. Cirque is New Age,
everybody is dressed the same way, they move the same way, and it's
beautiful. You're going to be blown away, but at the end, tell me
one person that you remember or the name of a guy in the show. You
can't. We want to do the opposite. We want different personalities
to come out.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there is a big element of improvisation with our circus.
In Cirque, you see one show today and you see exactly the same show
tomorrow. Kaleidoscape ... It's always changing.''

CAST LEADS CHEERS FOR `ANY GIVEN SUNDAY' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ To hear Cameron Diaz talk, you'd think ``Any Given
Sunday'' is as much of a chick flick as ``Waiting to Exhale'' or
``Sleepless in Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't expect the reality of the movie: a three-hour melee
of testosterone-driven sex, drugs, violence and chaos _ of
hedonistic jocks, salacious women and ear-blasting near-carnage on
the gridiron.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, no. Not with Diaz talking.
</P>
<P>
   And not with the man who hired her _ writer-director Oliver
Stone _ within earshot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Given Sunday'' is ``actually interesting for women to
see,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz, second-billed to Al Pacino, plays the merciless, fiercely
driven young owner of the fictional Miami Sharks, a pro team she
inherits from her father.
</P>
<P>
   Pacino plays its workaholic but struggling head coach, who needs
Diaz's advice like he needs two injured quarterbacks, which he gets
in the first scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many different women in it,'' Diaz points out.
</P>
<P>
   Well, yeah. There are prostitutes (``Showgirls''' Elizabeth
Berkley plays one), a quarterback's harshly demanding wife (Lauren
Holly), and a wide array of groupies, bimbos, cheerleaders and
miniskirted predators.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to mention Diaz's screaming meanie, who attacks her
loyal coach for failing to win championships annually, or her
pathetic, alcoholic mother, played by Ann-Margret.
</P>
<P>
   Who needs Nora Ephron when you've got Oliver Stone?
</P>
<P>
   Diaz sees all these women as part of ``a very human story of
people in conflict, with football as the backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone can appreciate this story. For women, it's certainly a
film they can go and take something from.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Stone also defends the film, pointing out that pro
players attract ``a lot of party girls and groupies. You have to
deal with that.''
</P>
<P>
   He also insists he's an ``equal-opportunity employer'' and no
sexist _ when it comes to flashing nudity. In one scene, Diaz
confronts a player in a locker room filled with naked gladiators (a
scene she wincingly recounts).
</P>
<P>
   Full-frontal? A frontal lobotomy? You decide what was needed.
</P>
<P>
   As for Stone, 52, he asserts, ``Hey, I love women. I have no
problem with women. I'm very close to my ex-wives.''
</P>
<P>
   He admiringly calls Berkley's character ``a pro.'' (Well, yes,
by definition.) And as for Holly's harpy, he says, ``You'd be
surprised, but with three or four major quarterbacks, their wives
run the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Ain't love grand?
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Dennis Quaid, who plays the Sharks' aging and injured
star quarterback _ a man who'd love to retire if his
status-obsessed wife (Holly) would just let him.
</P>
<P>
   She plans to stand by her man _ at least until he winds up in
traction.
</P>
<P>
   But that was on-screen. Making the movie was a different story.
Then, masculinity ruled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent months on sets with manly men doing manly things with
men,'' Quaid said. ``There were a lot of guys.'' (Teams were
comprised mostly of players from the World Football League and
Arena Football League.)
</P>
<P>
   Quaid, who'd played a quarterback in 1988's ``Everybody's All
American'' but never played football as a youth, practiced with the
San Francisco 49ers' Steve Young and the Miami Dolphins' Dan Marino
before rolling for Stone.
</P>
<P>
   But that's as far as the real thing went. The National Football
League wouldn't sanction Stone's script, forcing him to create a
fictional league.
</P>
<P>
   This refusal to play ball didn't surprise Quaid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say I blame them,'' he said. ``If I were a corporation
with that much money involved _ you'd want to have it portrayed the
way you want, not with a loose cannon like Oliver Stone.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone's stars use such terms admiringly. Yet in some ways they
apply painfully.
</P>
<P>
   The acclaimed writer-director of ``Platoon'' and ``Born on the
Fourth of July'' _ war movies that both won him Oscars as best
director _ has had a rough ride recently.
</P>
<P>
   His last film, 1997's ``U Turn,'' made $6 million domestically,
and 1995's ``Nixon,'' costing $50 million, made $14 million.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, artistry shouldn't be measured merely by profits. But
Stone also has had personal detours stemming from a history of drug
use.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer he was arrested and later pleaded no contest to
charges of drunken driving and drug possession. As part of his plea
bargain, he entered drug rehab.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs also are a part of pro football's tableau, and Stone
didn't flinch from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Given Sunday'' has any number of drug scenes, from glowing
swirls of liquor in icy glasses to the pain-killers injected into
suffering players, to the cocaine they snort at parties.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all Stone's sensationalism about the rigors and hedonism
of the sport, he ultimately embraces a rah-rah philosophy of
teamwork first, individuality second.
</P>
<P>
   Stone believes a ``big problem'' in the NFL now is ``not only
the length of games and the bloodiness, but that people are really
playing for themselves because the money is so big.''
</P>
<P>
   A longtime NFL fan, he sees pro football as ``the American
religion. It's ritualized violence, but it's allowable.''
</P>
<P>
   When Stone made war movies, he drew upon his own experiences
serving in Vietnam. He didn't play football, but he sees its
violent conquests of territory as a metaphor for war.
</P>
<P>
   In short, he's the ideal director for such a film _ until
someone can find a way to merge ``Titanic's'' sensitivity with
football's savagery.
</P>
<P>
   As an outsider, Stone tried to ``be humble and make it
authentic.'' He cast former players such as Jim Brown and Lawrence
Taylor and relied on them and others as advisers (though even
casual fans will note many errors).
</P>
<P>
   One big hurdle was filmmaking's repetition.
</P>
<P>
   The ``highly skilled testosterone animals'' Stone hired weren't
playing a three-hour game once a week. They had to hit each other
daily for long hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``A war film is pure chaos,'' Stone said. ``But this was very
rigorous, orchestrated chaos. Chaos can be fertile or destructive.
You just can't let it get out of hand. But chaos is great.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the coach Pacino plays, Stone is ``a driven man,'' Diaz
said. ``In fact, he's the most driven person I've ever seen. But
he's so in control and knows exactly where he's going.''
</P>
<P>
   For Stone, that direction was crystalized by his impressions as
a fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing comes easy in football,'' he said. ``It's hard, it's
fast, and every play is tough. It's also up and down.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused, perhaps sensing a parallel to his own life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you're a hero,'' Stone said with a small smile, ``you
can be a bum on the next play.''

SWINGING INTO COMEDY

   Fanny Kerwich swung from her first trapeze just a few years
after she learned to walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 6, I started to work with the trapeze in the ring,'' she
says. ``It was lots of fun. At that age, I didn't know it was
dangerous. Then I fell down. After that I knew.''
</P>
<P>
   When the 31-year-old performer falls now, she does so on
purpose. Kerwich was born into a circus family and grew up in
France. She learned acrobatics, too, but her dream was to be a
clown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comedy was my first love. My brother was a clown. At that
time, in Europe, to be a girl clown was not allowed.''
</P>
<P>
   But when her brother became ill when she was 14, the circus
needed a sub, and her street-urchin character was a hit. Kerwich
went on to perform in cabarets, variety shows and circuses in
Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The character is still just like me when I was 12. I was
always wearing boots with dresses.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kaleidoscape, she helps David Larible keep the show flowing
and entertains children in the pre-show, her favorite part of the
production.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I love. I think for that time, all those people
think life is beautiful. In the beginning, children are thinking,
`What does she want from me?' In the show, they watch me, and when
they leave, they leave as friends.''

   If Picasso Jr. had followed his original plan he would be behind
a desk, assessing taxes, instead of performing with Kaleidoscape.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish juggler earned an economics degree and was serving
in the military when a family circus rolled into the African city
where he was stationed.
</P>
<P>
   He had learned to juggle from his father, El Gran Picasso, but
the son considered it a hobby, not a career option.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father always told me I could be a good juggler. He always
wanted me to be one, but I was really shy. I didn't like to perform
at all,'' he admits.
</P>
<P>
   Then the circus arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 10 years, no circus went through this area. The year I'm
doing my military service, the circus comes through. So I go over
there, and the family knew my father. I showed them what I could
do, saying I needed to practice more. They said, `What? No
practice. You need to act.'
</P>
<P>
   After his military duty ended, Picasso Jr. returned to Spain.
His father convinced him to perform a series of casino dates with
him. He did, and he was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   Now 30, Picasso Jr.'s plate-throwing act keeps Kaleidoscape
audiences ducking. The dishes he whips to each corner of the tent
magically fly back to his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make it look so easy. But you have to spin it just the right
way.'' &QL;

`BONE' JUST A SKELETON
</HEADLINE>

(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 2 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Play It to the Bone'' plays like a bare-bones knockoff of a
Ron Shelton sports comedy. There are the usual loser-ish but
devoted athletes, eccentrically sexy women and verbal gymnastics we
associate with Shelton's smart, soulful entertainments ``Bull
Durham,'' ``White Men Can't Jump'' and ``Tin Cup.'' But in this
round, the athletes and the women are quirk collections rather than
characters, and the dialogue has no punch.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this one's a boxing movie _ at its climax, anyway. Much too
much of the film's running time is devoted to a bloodless road trip
from L.A. to Vegas, with the principals yakking it up to no real
comic or revelatory effect in a nausea-green, classic muscle car.
There are a handful of choice exchanges during this hour-plus
event, but the overall effect is not just one of wasted celluloid,
but wasted gas as well.
</P>
<P>
   Cesar Dominguez (Antonio Banderas) and Vince Boudreau (Woody
Harrelson) are two past-their-prime never-weres who still spar
religiously at an East L.A. gym. When the undercard contenders for
a Mike Tyson match turn up A) blitzed-out on drugs and B) dead the
morning of the big fight, desperate promoters Joe Domino (Tom
Sizemore, obviously sleazy) and Hank Goody (Robert Wagner,
sophisticatedly so), offer our two mooks the opening matchup if
they can get to the Strip on time.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons that are never made clear _ nor, for that matter,
exploited for even the most elementary comic complications _ the
good buddies refuse plane tickets and get independent gal Grace
(Lolita Davidovich) to chauffeur them through the desert to Vegas.
Along the way, we learn that Grace used to date Vince and, after
``three good months'' of a half-year relationship, has abruptly
grown tired of Cesar. She still cares a lot about them both,
however, and tries to support each guy as he approaches his last
big underpaid shot.
</P>
<P>
   We also discover that the foul-mouthed Vince has been having
visions of Jesus lately and that Cesar, during a down period
following a botched shot at Madison Square Garden, experimented
with homosexuality. That's about the extent of their character
specifics; but these two are positively Chekhovian in comparison to
the nasty little party animal Lia (``Ally McBeal's'' Lucy Liu) they
pick up halfway through the trip. She's there primarily to provide
sexual recreation for Vince and get in fights with Grace.
</P>
<P>
   Once we finally make it to Mandalay Bay, things perk up a
little. There's some by-the-numbers stuff we already knew about how
promoters exploit fighters. But once Vince and Cesar enter the
ring, Shelton does a creditable job of mixing straightforward fight
footage with the kind of slo-mo mythologizing stuff that's been a
boxing-movie cliche since the first ``Rocky.'' It's a long,
punishing sequence that rings pretty true, and that at least is
mercifully light on bad dialogue, if not on pointless celebrity
cameos.
</P>
<P>
   You can't really call the film's three lead performances bad;
Banderas, especially, displays some fine moves. There just isn't
anything clever or insightful on the page for them to make much out
of, no matter how hard they try.
</P>
<P>
   The kids have heart and they give it all they've got. But ``Play
It to the Bone'' stumbles early and never really recovers. &QL;

`THE LYNCH WHO STOLE CHRISTMAS' ON INDEPENDENT FILM CHANNEL

<TEXT>
<P>
   All alone for Christmas and feeling blue? Maybe ``Blue Velvet''
is the answer.
</P>
<P>
   It's part of a daylong David Lynch marathon Saturday on the
Independent Film Channel, dubbed ``The Lynch Who Stole Christmas.''
The program kicks off at 6 a.m. Christmas morning, about the time
wide-eyed little ones will be scampering out to the tree _ at
someone else's house.
</P>
<P>
   The lineup includes: ``Lost Highway,'' starring Bill Pullman as
a jazz musician suspected of killing his wife (Patricia Arquette);
``Pretty as a Picture: The Art of David Lynch,'' with Pullman,
Arquette, Mel Brooks and others offering insights and anecdotes
about their experiences working with Lynch; Terry Zwigoff's
documentary ``Crumb,'' about '70s artist Robert Crumb, which was
executive produced by Lynch; and ``Independent Focus: David
Lynch,'' in which the filmmaker fielded questions from a live
audience.
</P>
<P>
   The IFC also is screening the rarely shown 1995 project
``Lumiere &AMP; Co.,'' for which Lynch and 39 other directors were
asked to make a short film apiece using the original Cinematographe
invented by the Lumiere Brothers 100 years earlier. Spike Lee, Wim
Wenders, Liv Ullman and other directors were given three rules to
follow: The film could be no longer than 52 seconds, it could not
have synchronized sound, and it had to be shot in a maximum of
three takes. Lynch's contribution has been described as ``a bizarre
mini-epic.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no Lynch-ing would be complete without ``Blue
Velvet,'' one of the most talked-about films of 1986. It deals with
a quirky small-town mystery involving a kinky nightclub singer
(Isabella Rossellini), a sadistic drug dealer (Dennis Hopper) and
other odd types.

NOT-SO-PERFECT BOOKS OFFER GOOD CAREER LESSONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I get dozens of career books each year. A handful are so
wonderful that I write about them right away; most of the rest get
discarded in a hurry. But there is a third group: Some books are
intriguing enough to be useful to some people, but have one flaw or
another that keeps me from wholeheartedly recommending them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they are too good to ignore. Some could be perfect gifts,
if you know someone who fits into a particular book's niche
audience. Here are four such books, ones I was able to put down,
but couldn't throw away:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Who Moved My Cheese?'' by Spencer Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   If this book would just come out in paperback for $9.95 or so, I
would recommend it without hesitation. But it is only the size of a
long magazine article and sells for $19.95, which would buy a heck
of a lot of Gorgonzola.
</P>
<P>
   The main part of the book is a parable about four mice who live
in a maze and survive by eating cheese. One day the cheese
disappears from its usual place, confounding a couple of the mice.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, co-author of ``The One Minute Manager,'' uses the
parable to illustrate how difficult it can be to deal with change,
and what people need to do not only to survive, but to thrive.
</P>
<P>
   The people who struggle most in their careers these days are
those uncomfortable with change. They had a job that was at least
reasonable, then the company merged or they got laid off or their
duties changed dramatically. They dwell on what used to be rather
than moving on.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's book can help them. It also can be useful when life
gives you a nasty twist, like a serious illness or divorce or the
death of a loved one.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Clarity Quest,'' by Pamela Ammondson.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most valuable things you can do in your career is
take a sabbatical, giving yourself some time to think about how
things are going and whether you need to go in a new direction.
</P>
<P>
   But many jobs don't let you take a break, and some workers can't
afford any unpaid time off because they live from paycheck to
paycheck. Ammondson's book tries to help, describing how you can
take a sabbatical of sorts while using up only one week of vacation
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clarity Quest'' outlines an eight-week process, but only the
eighth week involves taking time off from work. During the first
seven weeks, Ammondson guides you through various exercises
designed to help you relax and focus on the things that really
matter in your life.
</P>
<P>
   The book is too touchy-feely for my tastes, and I think a lot of
people could achieve the same results on their own, if they just
took the time to focus on their careers and their lives.
</P>
<P>
   But many people simply don't know how to begin. Even if they
take a sabbatical, the only insight they will gain is from watching
``Oprah.''
</P>
<P>
   If you know something needs to change in your career or your
life and you are not sure how to approach it, ``Clarity Quest''
could help.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Power of Positive Criticism,'' by Hendrie Weisinger.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the advice in this book ought to be superfluous;
managers with a few street smarts ought to know how to criticize
employees constructively, and rank-and-filers ought to appreciate
the need for criticism to help the company function better.
</P>
<P>
   But often they don't.
</P>
<P>
   Weisinger's book offers insights into why criticism is valuable
and how it is often abused. He explains how bosses need to use
careful timing and just the right words to correct employees
without making them feel hurt or bitter.
</P>
<P>
   Rank-and-filers can benefit from the book as well. The book
explains how to handle touchy situations, such as criticizing your
boss or dealing with co-workers who are constantly negative.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The 75 Greatest Management Decisions Ever Made ... and 21 of
the worst,'' by Stuart Crainer.
</P>
<P>
   There are some classic lessons in here, such as Henry Ford's
innovations in automobile manufacturing, and how Walt Disney
listened to his wife, Lillian. He wanted to call his cartoon
character Mortimer Mouse, but she thought that was a Mickey Mouse
idea.
</P>
<P>
   The 21 bad decisions are also useful, particularly because some
of them were made by people like Ford (who decided to build
submarines during World War I) and some of the leaders of Silicon
Valley. Even brilliant people can screw up royally.
</P>
<P>
   The book's biggest flaw is that it is overly ambitious. Having
75 decisions makes it seem too much like a laundry list rather than
offering much insight.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Crainer's book could be a good reference for a lot of
managers, and a reminder of how fine the line can be between
brilliance and stupidity.

DIRECTOR EXAMINES THE NATURE OF FACADES IN `MOTHER' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until ``All About My Mother,'' there were two faces to Pedro
Almodovar. The angular, style-is-substance one and the downy-soft
one that feels increasingly touched by an angel.
</P>
<P>
   (It should be noted that even the angels in an Almodovar film
wear leopard-print miniskirts and Gucci shades.)
</P>
<P>
   But since ``The Flower of My Secret'' in 1996, and most
alarmingly with ``Live Flesh'' in 1997, he's been experimenting
with a formalism that felt conventional, like someone was standing
over him saying, ``Oh, behave!''
</P>
<P>
   How does a man ostensibly fed up with being the Agnes (``All My
Children'') Nixon of Spanish cinema satisfy fuddy-duddy critics who
have derided him for his lack of maturity and emotional sincerity?
He gets introspective and makes a movie about sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   For Almodovar, looking inward is unusual therapy that is as much
to do with his artistic loves as his deepest self. Soul
searchingly, he's dedicated ``All About My Mother'' to ``all
actresses who have played actresses, to men who act and become
women, to all the people who want to be mothers.'' It's a
romantically labyrinthine tribute that piles layers of intertextual
shout-outs to ``All About Eve,'' Tennessee Williams, Truman Capote
and Alfred Hitchcock, and beautifully assesses the nature of
facades. Once you peel away the performance, what is left is the
emotion it masks.
</P>
<P>
   Sincerity was not something Almodovar's films needed _ there is
no more sincere and smitten a socio-sexual gamesman.
</P>
<P>
   His mothers were never just mommies, they were Madonnas of the
highest, most glamorously neurotic order. To see him flirting with
conventions like the flaccid noir in ``Live Flesh'' was upsetting
because you could see him struggling to ``grow up'' by trying to
keep a straight face.
</P>
<P>
   But in ``All About My Mother,'' Almodovar imbues his
Harlequin-novel-meets-Marvel-comic-book melodramas with something
more than a wink and a smile, and it's beguiling.
</P>
<P>
   His expressionism and his screenwriting have always had fun
together, but now there is a kind of faith and spirituality that
sexcapades like ``Laws of Desire'' and ``Kika'' only laughed at.
</P>
<P>
   The film is about Manuela (Cecilia Roth), a Madrid nurse
dedicated to her teen-age son Esteban (Eloy Alzorin), who is
writing a story about her. Her birthday presents to him are
perfectly thematic _ Capote's ``Music for Chameleons'' and a
production of ``A Streetcar Named Desire.'' In a shatteringly shot
and performed sequence, Esteban is killed chasing Huma Rojo (Marisa
Parades), the show's Blanche du Bois, in her limo one rainy night.
If there is a difference between the Almodovar of old and the one
working here, it has been the replacement of irony with a more
astral, less literary idea of destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Before, with Almodovar, a sudden tragedy like Esteban's death
would have weakened Manuela, depraved her. But here and in Roth's
delicate hands, Manuela is an emblem of sacrifice, nearly crippled
by grief.
</P>
<P>
   She sets out to fulfill her son's birthday wish: to know his
father. As Manuela heads to Barcelona to find Esteban's father,
``All About My Mother'' unfurls into a journey film, the breadth of
which makes for Almodovar's most profound writing. Where he was
once an iconographer and cartographer of a woman's identity, he has
now forsaken sex, per se, for gender, eroticism for sensuality.
While other aging directors (Almodovar is only 48) from Scorsese
(``Bringing Out the Dead'') to Lynch (``The Straight Story'') are
looking for humanism, Almodovar is merely plumbing the depths of
his own.
</P>
<P>
   Every soul Manuela encounters in Barcelona _ from Huma and her
co-star (and lover) Nina (Candela Pena) to the philosophically
narcissistic transsexual Agrado (Antonia San Juan) and the
pregnant, AIDS-struck nun (Penelope Cruz) _ is cosmically,
symbiotically stitched into her quest.
</P>
<P>
   ``All About My Mother'' is Almodovar's 14th feature, but it
contains a host of superlative firsts: a handful of the only truly
moving scenes he has filmed, the most gorgeous dialogue he has
composed, his most dimensional performances of his most dimensional
characters and perhaps his most dynamic photography and elaborate
production design.
</P>
<P>
   That haunting super-size billboard of Huma's face that Manuela
stands in front of at one point is like a live, humanized
Lichtenstein painting. It is the type of alluring pop scenery
Almodovar has always used to beautify his melodramatic operas, only
now the soap has been left at home beside the kitchen sink.

<P>
   The Coca-Cola Co.'s recent troubles might not have been so bad
if executives there had paid more attention to a classic.
</P>
<P>
   No, not Classic Coke, but classic Shakespeare. Namely,
``Hamlet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They totally mishandled the crisis in Belgium on the health
scare,'' said Kenneth Adelman, coauthor of ``Shakespeare in Charge:
The Bard's Guide to Leading and Succeeding on the Business Stage.''
He said Coca-Cola tried to downplay the tainted Coke rather than
being open with the public, and now M. Douglas Ivester, Coke's
chief executive, is stepping down as the company continues to
sputter.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester would have done better to follow the lead of Claudius in
``Hamlet,'' who was open with Laertes about how Hamlet killed
Laertes' father, Polonius.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that Claudius did not do was establish a crisis
center Web page,'' Adelman joked. He and coauthor Norman Augustine
have set up such a Web page at www.shakespeareincharge.com.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Adelman and Augustine use five plays by William
Shakespeare to illustrate key concepts about management, such as
how Petruchio effected change in ``The Taming of the Shrew,'' how
Mark Antony seized opportunity in ``Julius Caesar'' and how
Claudius handled crises in ``Hamlet.''
</P>
<P>
   Their book also points to modern examples to make crucial
points. When the beverage maker Odwalla had problems with E. coli
bacteria in its organic juice drinks in 1996, the authors write,
President Greg Steltenpohl handled the problem swiftly and limited
the damage _ which otherwise could have wiped out the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty minutes after learning of the contamination, Odwalla
held a press conference to announce that it was recalling all its
products containing unpasteurized apple juice, the culprit in this
case,'' they write. ``But, as the bad news spread, Steltenpohl
realized that wasn't enough. The newly formed crisis-management
team decided to use the Internet to reach the public. It flew in
Matthew Harrington, a public-relations specialist from Edelman
Public Relations in San Francisco, to create a crisis Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The savvy publicity firm had already reserved a Web site for
potential crisis communications by its clients. By late afternoon
the same day, they had posted a letter to the public on the Web
site that explained what they were doing to ensure that their
consumers were safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Adelman said in an interview that he has seen many leaders who
are more concerned with getting and keeping their jobs than they
are with managing effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find in a lot of leaders, like a lot of leaders in
Shakespeare, that they don't know what to do with their
leadership,'' said Adelman, a former U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations. ``I see that a lot of times with politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   The authors use Petruchio's treatment of Katherine in ``The
Taming of the Shrew'' as an example of how managers can deal with
change. ``Aside from overall leadership, that is the most important
topic,'' Adelman said. ``The consequences of error are far greater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you anticipate change and force change in your
organization, you'll be ruined very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Adelman and Augustine write that Petruchio tries one approach to
change Katherine, but is ready with a backup plan when that fails.
Petruchio keeps his eye on his goal _ marrying Katherine _ and
comes up with a different strategy that eventually works.
</P>
<P>
   Adelman said that Petruchio's dramatic actions are in stark
contrast with what usually happens in companies during mergers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there is a merger or acquisition, the natural inclination
is to go slow,'' he said. ``By and large, that's the wrong
approach.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained that moving slowly just prolongs the stress for
workers and sometimes customers. ``People can adjust to almost
anything. It's the uncertainty that'll kill you.''

<P>
   Common sense and historical fact tell us that Jan. 1, 2000, is
just another day, that the transition from 1999 to to the next year
is an artificial development with no more real significance than
the odometer rolling over on the family minivan and producing an
amusing and neat little row of figures.
</P>
<P>
   This is not literally the 2,000th birthday of Christianity. Time
did not commence two millenniums ago. We're celebrating the
anniversary of nothing.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the symbolic power of that majestic, beautifully
curvaceous number is enough to spin the world into the most
extravagant global party humankind has ever known, and it is enough
to galvanize many fanatics into believing Armageddon is just hours
away, and it is enough to bring some of us to our knees in
worshipful gratitude for the lives we've been given, and it's
enough to give even the staunchest millennial Grinch a moment of
pause to reflect on our progress as a race of people. You'd have to
be dead not to acknowledge this particular New Year's Eve on some
level.
</P>
<P>
   As of right now, we don't know if Y2K will tangle the economy
and plunge some technologically challenged countries into darkness
and create problems that will dog us for months to come _ or if it
will end up as a trivia question on ``Who Wants to be a
Billionaire'' in the year 2100. Guessing the future, whether we're
trying to predict what will happen in hours or years, is for poets
and fools. (And journalists, of course.)
</P>
<P>
   As for the past: Over the last several weeks, scholars and
pundits the world over have marked the pending millennium by
analyzing our history. Athlete of the century, artist of the
decade, nation of the millennium, world leader of all-time, you
name it.
</P>
<P>
   So let's say goodbye to yesterday and hold off tomorrow for a
moment, as we consider today. The world, the United States, your
hometown and its people, as we open the door leading from 1999 to
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Let's consider that it might well be true that we're living in
the greatest, richest, most wonderful era any civilization has ever
known.
</P>
<P>
   The good old days? They're right here, right now.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I know: Every day, children go to bed hungry and wake up
crying. Nations go to war over conflicting religious beliefs and
400-year-old disputes. Some innocent babies grow up to be adults
who kill each other for no reason. Disease and poverty remain
strong as twin monsters.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying we have reached Utopia. I'm saying the overall
report card for life in this world as we stand on the edge of the
year 2000 scores higher than the marks we could attribute to any
era since Eve shared an apple with Adam, or the first fish learned
to crawl from the sea, or however this whole thing began.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly anybody ever says that about their particular time period
when they're in the middle of it. In 1610, did Galileo turn to one
of his buddies and say, ``Is this a great Renaissance or what?''
No, the golden label was affixed upon that era only after it was
over.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, did American couples of the late 1950s and
early 1960s sit around talking about how their world was basking in
the glow of the traditional family values that make this nation so
great?
</P>
<P>
   Doubtful. Pick up a newspaper from 40 years ago and you won't
see headlines reading ``LIFE IS SAFE AND PEACEFUL'' _ you'll see
stories about war and crime and social conflict and fear. Only in
retrospect do we color the past with sepia tones and purified
memories.
</P>
<P>
   When people say, ``Things used to be better back in 1959,'' or,
``I sure do miss 1975,'' what they're usually saying is, ``Things
used to be better back in 1959 because I was 18 then and the world
was mine for the taking,'' or, ``I sure do miss 1975 because I was
seven years old then and I hadn't a care in the world beyond
whether my mother would be topping off my after-school hot
chocolate with miniature marshmallows.''
</P>
<P>
   We hug the past because the past is secure. It has no capacity
to startle or hurt us any more.
</P>
<P>
   Let's deal with another round number _ say, the America of 1900.
The date has a ring of charm and possibility to it, eh? Bicycles
with big wheels and horse-drawn carriages, a growing city on the
eve of the 20th century and all that.
</P>
<P>
   But would anyone argue that life was easier, more comfortable,
more exciting, 100 years ago? A thousand years ago? For that
matter, 10 years ago? If you could be the same age you are now in
any of the aforementioned years, would you make the trade _ not
just for a time-traveling adventure, but forever?
</P>
<P>
   Very soon, we'll wake up to the United States of 2000. Squint
and you'll see all kinds of problems and worries, just like all
people have had to deal with on every morning of every day in every
millennium we've ever known.
</P>
<P>
   Open your eyes wider, though, and take a deep breath, and you
just might see that you're lucky enough to be alive for the dawn of
yet another day in a golden age.

CALL IT THE BOGART CENTURY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: EMBARGOED until Dec. 25) 
 
 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems safe to say that the 20th was indeed the Century of the
Tough Guy. A weasely little tough guy necessitated our century's
fiercest war. Tough guys muscled their way into positions of power
and wealth the world over _ the meek didn't have a chance; all they
inherited were a few black eyes and rampant oppression. The most
celebrated athlete was a man whose job was to pummel in the skulls
of other men. Hollywood spent the most money on movies in which
tough guys blasted other tough guys to smithereens; Americans even
chose a man who played tough guys in the movies to be president,
presumably because they admired his get-tough policy with Angie
Dickinson in ``The Killers.''
</P>
<P>
   But throughout the century _ even after his death, not even
two-thirds of the way through it _ the consummate tough guy was
Humphrey Bogart. Bogart didn't start in movies until he was 31,
which today is about the age at which the E! Channel starts working
on the ``Where Are They Now?'' specials for washed-up tyro talents
weaned on slasher flicks and John Hughes vehicles; he wasn't a star
until 40, the age today that Tarantino wanna-bes start writing a
performer's ``comeback'' role.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Bogey killed guys, but they were usually guys who needed
killing to teach them a good lesson. Bogart carried with his
toughness a world-weariness, a palpable but unspoken hurt that
somehow justified the steely exterior, an existential ennui
enlivened only by danger, qualities sorely missing from the Ahnolds
and Jackies and Jean-Claudes of today. (How can you even think to
pose as a tough guy with a name like Jean-Claude, anyway?)
</P>
<P>
   And given that his birthday was Christmas Day 1899, Bogart's
century indeed comes to an appropriate close this week.
</P>
<P>
   A century could have a worse mascot.
</P>
<P>
   A parenthetical aside: Actually, there seems to be some
confusion over Bogart's birth date. One story _ promulgated as mere
myth in one biography and as truth in another book _ suggests he
was born in January but that Warner Bros. publicity changed it,
reasoning that even such a convincing heel couldn't be all bad if
he shared something with Christ, even if it was just a birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Since his death, Bogart has been the subject of more than 20
books, seven novels, a couple of plays, two movies and eight
documentaries. He has been named by a couple of industry lists as
the top movie performer of the century, and ``Casablanca'' ranks
near the top of all best-film lists.
</P>
<P>
   Herewith, how Humphrey bogarted the 20th century, in myths,
movies and, when we absolutely have to resort to them, facts.
</P>
<P>
   Bless the beasts and the children: Bogart was long rumored _
incorrectly, of course _ to have been the model for the
illustrations on the Gerber's Baby Food jars. His later behavior
proved how ironic that would have been.
</P>
<P>
   The art of the scandal: Bogart appeared with Fatty Arbuckle
(ground zero in Hollywood's first splashy scandal involving a dead
starlet) in the latter's failed comeback, a play called ``Baby
Mine,'' in 1927.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, he must have picked up a few pointers from the master _
Bogey earns a reputation for being brusque if not frequently drunk,
stumbling through four marriages, or roughly one every decade of
his adult life. His third is particularly boisterous _ he and Mayo
Methot spend the night of their 1938 wedding separated after a
drunken brawl and soon become known as ``the battling Bogarts''
(she stabs him in 1942).
</P>
<P>
   And if Bogey doesn't invent the concept of the trophy wife, he
certainly perfects it: Lauren Bacall, wife No. 4, is 25 years
younger than he. Scandal runs in the family: One sister dies at age
35 of alcoholism; the other was a manic-depressive.
</P>
<P>
   Enmity, thy name is Bogart: Eschewing the niceties that informed
society up to that point, Bogart helped usher in the era of the
public feud. Among those who loathed him: Billy Wilder, Bette
Davis, William Holden and George Raft (not to mention his
ex-wives).
</P>
<P>
   Educational and work-ethic anti-hero: Those who complain about
``kids today'' should take a look at ``kids back then'': Bogart was
put on probation and eventually expelled from prep school. The lack
of effort paid off so well he exploited it throughout his life: He
was (temporarily) declared a deserter by the Navy; Warner Bros.
routinely suspended him for sundry acts of insubordination.
</P>
<P>
   Birth of the cool: Before Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, et al.
turned it into a traveling circus given over to drinking,
womanizing and yukking it up in half-baked stage shows and movies,
Bogart created the Rat Pack as an itinerant group of drinking
buddies. ``Rats are very well behaved,'' Bogart explained at the
time, then seemingly contradicted himself: ``Rats are for staying
up late and drinking lots of booze.''
</P>
<P>
   Bogey the self-empowerment guru: Feminist film writer Joan
Mellen wrote of Bogart, ``He taught the young that self-confidence
was a moral, rather than a material, quality and need have no
connection with physical perfection.''
</P>
<P>
   Bogey as fashion plate: The actor's trademark trench coat has
become synonymous with both menace and crime-busting. Private eyes
continued to wear them in movies and TV for years _ even if, in
Columbo's case, it was dismayingly rumpled _ and the long black
duster was the outerwear of choice for Eurotrash villains in most
action flicks in the '80s; Keanu Reeves donned one most recently in
``The Matrix.''
</P>
<P>
   Thank Bogey for Hollywood's financial disparity: In 1946, Bogart
was the highest-paid actor in the world. He earned $467,000, not
quite the $20 million payday stars reap today, but then, there
weren't as many Faberge eggs or Ferraris to acquire back then. He
was also the first major star to start his own production company,
Santana, named after his boat. Small wonder Bogart disparaged
communism during the McCarthy witch hunts of the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   High art by way of Hollywood: Jean-Luc Godard's ``Breathless''
ushered in the French New Wave of film; the main character was
based on Bogart's persona.
</P>
<P>
   War hero: Bogart was called for active service in the Navy in
World War I, assigned to the USS Leviathan two days before the
Armistice. He appeared in three of the most famous World War II
films of all time _ ``Casablanca,'' of course, ``The Caine Mutiny''
and ``To Have and Have Not''; the first two earned him Oscar
nominations. He declines, however, to enlist for the combat film
``God Is My Co-Pilot,'' perhaps inspiring a future generation of
draft dodgers during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Bogey's history lessons: Bogart's Oscar-winning performance was
for ``The African Queen,'' set in Africa during World War I.
Prohibition and the Crash of '29 are depicted in Bogart's 1939 film
``The Roaring Twenties.'' He frequently played gangsters in his
early films; of his breakthrough film, 1936's ``The Petrified
Forest,'' The New York Times observed, ``Humphrey Bogart can be a
psychopathic gangster more like Dillinger than the outlaw
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem we all live with: Bogart took on racism in 1937's
``Black Legion,'' playing an embittered factory worker who joins a
pseudo-patriotic Klan-like group, only to discover their sinister
motives.
</P>
<P>
   Why do you think they call it dope?: Bogey even contributed,
however unwillingly and unwittingly, to the drug culture of the
'60s and '70s with his trait of having a cigarette dangling from
his lips. The last thing anyone wanted to hear was the phrase
``Don't bogart that joint,'' suggesting a lack of sociability with
regard to encouraging community highs.
</P>
<P>
   The thin black and blue line: ``Bullets or Ballots'' was about a
cop apparently embracing the wrong side of the law. ``The Great
O'Malley'' is about an overzealous cop driving an innocent man to a
life of crime. ``Crime School'' hinged on a sadistic reform school
officer. The renegade attitude of certain police forces was no
doubt inspired by the famous line from the Bogart film ``The
Treasure of the Sierra Madre'': ``Badges? We don't need no stinking
badges!''
</P>
<P>
   Brought to you by: When, after years of artistic resistance to
the concept of ``selling out to the establishment,'' it became
acceptable to crassly hawk products on TV, who was there ordering
up a Coca-Cola in a TV commercial 30 years after his death? You got
it _ sellout by proxy Bogey.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of Bogart films anticipate climactic changes that were to
come in the media. In ``Two Against the World,'' Bogey played an
unscrupulous radio station manager _ a very early incarnation of
Matt Drudge or Sally Jessy Raphael _ who broadcasts sensational and
exploitative reports; one so badgers a couple that they commit
suicide. ``Deadline, U.S.A.,'' starring Bogart as an editor chasing
down a scoop on the last day before his newspaper folds, seems to
foretell the death of print journalism, if not quite the advent of
the Internet, a full half-century before it came into vogue. Talk
about your visionaries.
</P>
<P>
   We'd write more, but, as Bogey famously observed, ``The whole
world is about three drinks behind,'' and we want to catch up
before his century passes. &QL;

Bill Koch about now. It's been 23 years since he won Olympic
silver, 17 since he won the overall World Cup title.

<P>
   --And don't forget: The best day of the year to be on the slopes

<P>
   --Which raises a further point: If New Year's Eve is for

NEW INVESTOR HELPS OTTEN BUILD MOUNTAINS OF CONFIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As he was forming the American Skiing Company in recent years,
Les Otten, who holds a private pilot's license, saw the
organization grow so fast that he said he felt like he was trying
to land an F-15 on a carrier deck but suddenly realized he hadn't
learned to fly.
</P>
<P>
   But reports after last year's miserable ski season that Otten
had crashed and burned, are unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, while this season's lack of natural snow has prompted
ASC to cobble together an arcane ``guaranteed skiing'' deal to
visitors, Otten's empire has been given a major infusion of new
capital _ $150 million invested by the Texas-based firm of Oak Hill
Partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have stabilized our company,'' says Otten, who still works
out of an office at the base of Sunday River in Bethel, Maine.
``Oak Hill's cash was a pretty important investment. I feel very
secure in the company's position and our ability to perform in the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many new companies, ASC has yet to turn a profit, and since
going public two years ago, the company's stock has taken a
beating. Last year's snowless winter resulted in a $32.3 million
loss and employee layoffs across the resort holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Otten pressed on, developing ever more slopeside real
estate, acquiring new holdings and upgrading almost all the
properties. ASC owns Sunday River and Sugarloaf in Maine;
Killington/Pico, Sugarbush, and Snow/Haystack in Vermont;
Attitash/Bear Peak in New Hampshire; Heavenly in California,
Steamboat in Colorado, and The Canyons in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Having grown so large so fast, then suffering the worst ski
seasons in a generation in the East _ and no great shakes in the
Rockies _ Otten's could be forgiven a case of the nerves about now.
But, he says, ``This time of year, the pressures are all positive.
We're getting psyched for a new season, the adrenline's flowing. If
I had that faint a heart, I shouldn't have gotten into the ski
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ever since his college days in New Jersey more than 30
years ago when he tried to buy a small ski area near home, Otten
has worked fulltime on buying and developing ski areas. And ski
seasons, he has come to know, tend to average out. Financial
analysts have assessed ASC's situation as stable enough to survive,
even through subpar winters. Still, says Otten, ASC needs a decent
winter to resume working toward its longer-range goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is we're entering this year so much stronger
financially,'' says Otten.
</P>
<P>
   But surviving a season or two is far from what Otten _ or his
investors _ had in mind. Known for over 25 years as one of the best
snowmakers in the industry, ASC is staying technologically current
in snowmaking at all areas, according to Otten, and the company is
moving ahead with several projects, some of which were shelved last
season.
</P>
<P>
   The largest single challenge has been the development of The
Canyons in time for the 2002 Winter Olympics. With 3,300 skiable
acres and a vertical rise of 3,200 feet, The Canyons is currently
the seventh largest ski area in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The area currently has the approvals to become the largest ski
in the United States,'' says Otten. ``We're just putting the
finishing touches on about 1,500 new beds that will all be
available by the first of February.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a remarkable opportunity to get it. If you could have
been at Aspen in the 1950s or Vail in the 1960s or Beaver Creek in
the 1980s, that's kind of the opportunity that The Canyons is
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of skiers seem to agree. Early in the New Year a 350-room
Grand Summit _ largest and fanciest of the ASC slopeside hotels _
will be pened. It already is 60 percent sold out. The familiar
quarter share (giving owners one-fourth of the time in a season,
with option trades around the resort world) sells for $115,000 for
a two-bedroom. Total net is $460,000. Another lodge, the Sundial,
opened with an offering of two-bedroom condos at $400,000 each and
sold out in 10 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very happy and optimistic about the fact that young
families are making investments in ski areas at a record pace,''
says Otten, whose new Jordan Grand Hotel at Sunday River is 70
percent sold.
</P>
<P>
   Otten's story is as well known and oft-told as any folk tale in
ski literature _ how a young cast-off executive from the Killington
Ski Company inside of two decades owned that area and eight others,
making him the largest single entrepeneur in skiing.
</P>
<P>
   So meteoric was his rise that as big as the company grew, so did
his status as a target. ``Sure I was up there for people to take
shots at,'' says Otten, who is quick to add that ASC is ``now in a
position to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Longer-term questions, such as the flat number of skier visits
for several years and the aging of the boomer generation do not
worry him. ``Luckily,'' he says, ``Jake Burton invented snowboards.
I'm optimistic. Taking a longer view, we have a record number of
young people entering the sport. We have a record number of people
buying real estate in our company, and the pace they're buying is a
record. It far exceeds anything we saw in the '70s and '80s.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his favorite getaways is still to take off for five-plus
days with family and friends to ski areas outside ASC property
(``Every day skiing at your own area is a work day,'' he says). He
skis all over the world, and even has a snowboard in his office
that he uses ``maybe 10 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still enjoy skiing,'' says Otten, whose wife, Chris, has
been in the retail skiwear business at Sunday River and other Otten
holdings. ``I started with those feelings for the sport, and I
still have a passion for it.''

ULTRASOUND ISN'T A `BETTER MOUSETRAP' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I really have to get rid of my mice. I am not too wild about
traps, or D-Con, although a man used D-Con eight years ago and got
rid of them. I saw on TV something called Rid-A-Pest, an electronic
ultrasound machine that claims to get rid of mice. Do those things
work?
</P>
<P>
   P.G., Needham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Mice often come into the house in the autumn when it gets
cold, but higher-than-normal temperatures this fall have probably
delayed the process. At any rate, there is an old saying that if
you see one mouse, you have 20. That is not a very nice thought,
but it does mean that you should do something about it. Here is
what an authoritative book on pesticides says about ultrasound
machines:
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no studies indicating (ultrasonic devices) are
effective at significantly reducing or eliminating rats or other
rodents from an area. . . . Until such studies are available, we do
not recommend the use of these products. There are reports showing
that certain ultrasonic devices are helpful when used in
combination with other methods, but this still does not mean they
alone will `eliminate' an infestation.''
</P>
<P>
   So, you pay your money and take your chances. Since D-Con worked
in the past, it will work again. Generally, mice killed by D-Con
and other poisons do not necessarily wind up in walls and other
sites to decay and smell up the house.
</P>
<P>
   Short of D-Con, then, it's back to the old snap traps, which are
instant death, not the slow, cruel death of sticky traps.
</P>
<P>
   And, while you are at it, inspect the foundation and exterior
walls for openings that a mouse could get through, then seal them.
Remember, a mouse's body is designed to get through surprisingly
small holes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I stained a nice table for my den, then put on three coats of
an oil-based polyurethane varnish. After two coats, I sanded
lightly and recoated. Now it looks dusty. When I wipe a wet sponge
on it, it looks great, but when it dries it looks dusty again. What
went wrong? One other thing: When I cleaned my brushes with
turpentine, they did not clean up at all well.
</P>
<P>
   DONALD FATZINGER, Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Join the club. The same thing happened to the handyman, and
he knew he was using water-based polyurethane varnish.
</P>
<P>
   Despite your calling it oil-based varnish, it was indeed water
based. And therein lies the problem. The brushes not cleaning up
well with turpentine (or paint thinner) was the clue that the
varnish is water based. Water will clean them up nicely; paint
thinner or turpentine will clean up oil-based varnish.
</P>
<P>
   That said, here is what happened. Everything was just perfect,
up to the third coat. The first coat soaked in, sealing the
surface; the second did the same, only less so; the third coat
stayed on the surface as a nice, smooth, consistent finish, except
that it was put on too thickly, and being water-based varnish, it
clouded up, creating that dusty look.
</P>
<P>
   When I wrote about my experience, a paint consultant called to
tell me that I had applied the third coat too thickly, but I
really, truly thought I did very thin coats, which I preach about
all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, you have to redo the table that looks dusty, by sanding
to the bare wood, restaining, and applying two or three coats of an
oil-based polyurethane varnish. And, thin coats.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How can I clean a wood cabinet that has been polyurethaned?
The same goes for a polyurethaned floor.
</P>
<P>
   DAVID PEARSON, Melrose, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Varnished finishes, and in your case and most other cases,
poluyrethane-varnished finishes, are pretty tough, stand up to wear
and tear, and look good for decades. The only weakness of such a
finish, on furniture and floors, is that it is easily scratched.
</P>
<P>
   Keep it clean by dusting with a dry cloth (dry mop or broom for
the floor). Occasionally, on both, wash with paint thinner, which
dissolves the dirt so it can be wiped up. This will dull the
finish, which can be restored by buffing with a dry cloth.
</P>
<P>
   A mild solution of a good detergent and water will also clean
furniture and floors, but water should be used sparingly; in other
words, squeeze out your sponge when you use water.
</P>
<P>
   A floor does not have to be treated with anything else, except
area rugs. As for furniture, it is the handyman's opinion that
polish should not be used because it is not needed. Repeated
polishing results in a built-up finish that is dull and collects
dirt, then has to be removed. So why bother? If you insist, use as
little as possible and not more than two or three times a year.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Some short ends of pressure-treated boards were left over
from a building project. Can I burn them to get rid of them? If
not, how can I get rid of them? What about scraps of siding that
have been treated with Cuprinol?
</P>
<P>
   MARY POLSONETTI, Wenham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Pressure-treated wood should not be burned, especially not in
a stove or fireplace; its chemicals become harmful air pollutants.
You can dispose of your boards in the trash collection. The
Cuprinol-treated siding can be burned a few scraps at a time _ but
no more than a few; make sure the fireplace draws properly.
</P>
<P>

ECONOMIST KRUGMAN CRUNCHES MORE THAN NUMBERS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH P. KAHN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRINCETON, N.J. _ Academic economics is widely construed to be a
clannish, genteel profession, a world of arcane mathematical
formulas, macro-something theories, and politely warring egos
debating the nuances of International Monetary Fund policy. It's
not supposed to be about fame, clout, rivalry, revenge. However,
that view could undergo serious revision before Paul Krugman is
through.
</P>
<P>
   Krugman, 46, is an MIT economist whose specialties include
international trade and international finance. He is among the
profession's young superstars, a recipient (in 1991) of the Clark
Medal, signifying youthful excellence in the field. Often mentioned
as a Nobel Prize candidate, Krugman commands five-figure speaking
fees to enlighten corporate leaders and was rumored to be a
finalist for a Clinton administration job, an appointment he now
concedes would have been ``a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, he is a prolific, lively writer who communicates
complex ideas with a feel for vox-pop vernacular, so much so that
The New York Times recently asked Krugman to join its op-ed page
lineup. At this stage of his career, having taught at Yale and
Stanford before returning to MIT in 1996, Krugman can pretty much
punch his own institutional ticket. It's when he starts trading
punches with opponents on the left and right that the IMF sometimes
gets confused with the WWF.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this scrap, in the pages of Mother Jones, between
Krugman, a liberal columnist whose nonacademic work has, up until
recently, appeared regularly in Fortune and Slate, and Jude
Wanniski, a noted conservative supply-sider.
</P>
<P>
   Wanniski: ``Unsuspecting editors continue to pay (Krugman) for
plagiarizing his own material . . . the most elaborate Ponzi scheme
in American journalism . . . a charlatan. . . . If Krugman had to
predict to make a living, he would starve to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Krugman: ``If you plan to engage in character assassination, it
pays to do some homework. . . . Wanniski's consulting firm employs
followers of cultist Lyndon LaRouche. . . . We should be grateful
to Wanniski for writing this letter, which tells us all that we
need to know about his ideas, and more than we need to know about
his character. . . . What's a nice guy like (Jack) Kemp doing with
a guru like this?''
</P>
<P>
   Mercy. And that grudge match does not even touch liberal icons
like Lester Thurow, Laura Tyson, and Robert Reich, each of whom has
been similarly Krugmanned in print. If he does win a Nobel, here's
a safe prediction: It will not be the peace prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny,'' says Krugman. ``I certainly was not known as
being a disputatious guy before the early '90s. But then this whole
ideology emerged around American declinism and the superiority of
the Japanese economic model, and I came out swinging, for reasons
that still surprise me. I guess I was mad as hell and wasn't going
to take it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Seated in a loaner office at Princeton University _ Krugman is
on unpaid leave this year from MIT while finishing an economics
textbook _ he looks more Woody Allen than Woody Harrelson, a
bearded, unthreateningly gnomish figure dressed in rumpled khaki
trousers and a pastel-green sweater.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are serious guys in the economics profession who I think
are dead wrong about a lot of things,'' he continues. ``For
example, I disagree with Robert Barro a lot. But I would never take
him on the way I'd take on Robert Reich, because I regard Barro as
serious. Unlike Reich.''
</P>
<P>
   One eye fixed on his laptop screen, Krugman shrugs off a
question about feuds with other high-profile economists. The
French, he says, have a phrase for their nuclear deterrence policy,
one he finds particularly relevant to his own situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They call it an all-azimuths policy, as in facing in all
directions,'' says Krugman with a thin smile. ``Well, I like to
think that I have all-azimuths enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   In that case, look out. Because Krugman, also known as ``the Bad
Boy of Economics'' (The Washington Post) and ``America's most
controversial economist'' (Newsweek), is about to acquire his most
formidable weapons system yet: a semiweekly forum in the Times,
beginning in January.
</P>
<P>
   The move is an unusual one for the newspaper, which seldom taps
a nonstaffer (William Safire being the exception) for an op-ed job.
Krugman will keep his teaching post but give up other lucrative
pursuits. In exchange _ a Nobel for a Pulitzer? _ he will be handed
one of the premier seats in American journalism, and with it a rare
opportunity to influence public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was and am a bit nervous about this,'' Krugman admits. ``I
worry that friends and colleagues will end up defining me as a
journalist. But in the end this was just too interesting to pass
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Interesting for the Times, too. Times editorial-page editor
Howell Raines, who in partnership with publisher Arthur Sulzberger
Jr. courted Krugman for the job, said he ``felt intuitively'' that
Krugman was the right fit for the paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we looked outside for somebody to do economics and
finance, Paul's was the only name on our list,'' said Raines, in a
recent telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by a strong recommendation from Times columnist Thomas L.
Friedman, Raines added, he held several discussions with Krugman
over the summer, culminating with a long dinner in New York with
Sulzberger and a job offer the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   What impressed him most about Krugman, Raines said, was ``the
combination of an obviously powerful knowledge base, the ability to
think adventurously, and the bonus of being able to write with wit
and clarity. In a specialized field like economics, you can't get
by on style alone. But Paul is able to come up with the clarifying
example that's accessible to our readers without being overly
simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Raines laughed when told that Krugman had expressed nervousness
about producing two columns a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may be so,'' said the Times editor. ``But Paul never
struck me as someone who's lacking in self-confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ready or not, Krugman, who grew up on Long Island as the only
child of an insurance executive, is about to go boldly where no
full-time academic economist has gone before.
</P>
<P>
   Passionate about history and science fiction as a youth, Krugman
spent what he describes as ``four uneventful years'' at Yale, where
he majored in economics yet evinced little interest in campus, or
national, politics. A protege of the economist William Nordhaus,
Krugman did graduate work at MIT _ not terribly distinguished work,
he concedes _ before delivering a well-received paper at a national
economics conference in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   What followed, Krugman writes in one of several essays posted on
his Web page, was a series of ups and downs. Work on global trade
and credit exchange models helped make Krugman a budding star in
the early '80s. In 1982, he joined President Reagan's Council of
Economic Advisors for a year, where his writing skills sharpened
noticeably. Returning to MIT in 1983, however, Krugman suffered
through a fallow period and wondered if he had what it took to make
a lasting mark in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Krugman put those doubts to rest with a series
of brilliant papers challenging conventional dogma on free trade
and industrial policy. He also wrote his first book for popular
consumption, ``The Age of Diminished Expectations,'' a
media-friendly primer on economic theory. The Clark Medal followed,
along with interest from the Clinton team related to his work on
economic inequality. He and the Clinton camp disagreed over the
competitiveness issue, however _ Krugman thought US concerns over
foreign competition were overblown _ and there was little love lost
personally between Krugman and key Clinton insiders like Reich,
Tyson, and Ira Magaziner.
</P>
<P>
   Reich, now teaching at Brandeis, says that while Krugman is
``extremely bright,'' he has not always demonstrated what might be
called exceptional people skills.

   Here's a prescription for dental and environmental health _ a
toothbrush subscription.
</P>
<P>
   Somerville, Mass.-based Recycline is marketing the first-ever
toothbrush with a handle made entirely from recycled plastics. And,
to further court environment-conscious consumers, the company sells
its ``Preserve'' brush with a postage-paid mailer so it can be sent
back to the company for recycling.
</P>
<P>
   The old brushes will become plastic lumber that is used in park
benches.
</P>
<P>
   A one-year ``subscription'' of four Preserve toothbrushes and
mailers costs $17.95, which makes it a little more expensive than
standard brushes. But it's also doing your bit to cut back on the
50 millions pounds of plastic waste dumped annually in the United
States. The brush is available in seven colors with soft, medium or
firm bristles. A new brush arrives every three months, which is
what the American Dental Association recommends for use of a brush.
For more information, contact Recycline at (888) 354-7296 or check

   For those who'd like to hear more of the pitter-patter of tiny
feet around the house at holiday time, the Space Battle 2000
Commandobot might be just the ticket. The 18-inch-tall plastic
critter won't get you a cup of coffee or make the bed, but it fires
toy missiles, makes really neat sound effects and, best of all,
responds to your voice commands.
</P>
<P>
   The robot comes with a headset transmitter for the operator to
wear, and can be programmed to respond _ with voice acknowledgment
and flashing lights _ to any ``master's'' voice giving up to 12
commands.
</P>
<P>
   The Commandobot, made by MGA Entertainment of North Hills,
retails for about $100 in toy, mass merchandise and department

 WASHINGTON: ... and my God.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bauer, the former head of the Family Research Council and the
candidate most openly wooing the Christian conservatives, grew up
in a non-Christian home in Newport, Ky., was guided to church by a
devout grandmother, committed himself to Jesus as a teenager, and
was baptized beside his father, an alcoholic whose faith helped him
stay sober for long periods of time. Bauer says he believes in
heavenly miracles because ``for a janitor's son to end up as a
candidate for president is, in its own way, something of a
miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   At home, the Bauers practice what their fundamentalist church
preaches. Bauer's wife, Carol, belongs to Mothers in Touch, a group
that prays for public schools, teachers, and troubled children.
Both of Bauer's college-age daughters have committed to chastity
until marriage. Bauer is a Promise Keeper and has attended events
sponsored by the Christian men's group.
</P>
<P>
   In the Iowa debate, Bauer and Hatch joined the hallelujah
chorus, citing Jesus Christ as the historical figure they most
admire. But Keyes, who has made moral conviction the keystone of
his candidacy, said he found it ``shocking'' for Bush to reduce
Jesus to the secular status of a philosopher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't admire Christ. I worship him,'' Keyes said on
``Crossfire.'' ``He is the living son of the living God, and he
doesn't influence my mind. He shapes, guides, and commands that
mind, because he is the sovereign of my will. Jesus Christ was not
a `thinker.' He was the word itself.''
</P>
<P>
   As a Mormon, Hatch says the way he lives says more about his
love for Jesus than any testimonial. He doesn't smoke or drink, he
composes inspirational music, and reads at least 10 pages of the
Bible a day. The Utah Republican became a committed Christian at
17, and from age 20 to 22 spent ``the most important two years of
my life'' as a church missionary in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Bradley, no soul brother to Hatch in political
ideology, at one time shared a similar missionary zeal. His mother,
an ardent Methodist, ordered him to Sunday school, took him to
revivals, and sent him to a summer camp for Christian athletes.
Moved by the proselytizing of Fran Tarkenton and other sports
idols, the young Bradley was soon giving sermons himself and
writing about his faith in Jesus in evangelical journals.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Time Present, Time Past,'' his memoir, Bradley casts doubt
on whether he was truly born again when he made a bargain with God
as a struggling freshman at Princeton: get him through his first
year, Bradley prayed, and he would pay the Lord back. ``I had
convinced myself that this was my `personal experience' with
Jesus,'' wrote Bradley, a former New Jersey senator and pro
basketball star.
</P>

   Slowly, Bradley broke faith with his fundamentalism because, he
said, it was intolerant of debate and insensitive to civil rights.
As a Rhodes scholar, he took part in Billy Graham's crusade in
London but felt himself falling away. At an Oxford church, he was
offended by a preacher defending white rule in the former Rhodesia.
``I walked out, never to return,'' Bradley wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley says in his book that he now ``seeks my own individual
faith.'' In his campaign, he refuses to discuss his religion,
calling it ``an extremely private matter,'' adding that he respects
his rivals for their openness and ``I hope they respect me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. C. Weldon Gaddy, executive director of the Interfaith
Alliance, says that as long as religion doesn't become the primary
qualification for the presidency, it's healthy for the candidates
to make it part of their profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The watchword is caution,'' said Gaddy, a Baptist minister
whose group includes Christian, Jewish, and Moslem clergy and was
formed as a political counterweight to the Christian Coalition.
``My greatest fear is that declarations about Jesus somehow become
a substitute for discussing political and social issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Secular groups, such as Americans United for the Separation of
Church and State, have accused the candidates of pious pandering
and competing to be national preacher rather than president of a
pluralistic nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why all this wringing of hands, for crying out loud,'' said
Michael Cromartie, director of the Evangelical Studies Project at
the nonprofit Ethics and Policy Center. ``Not one of these men is
saying, `I have Christ in my heart, therefore I will create a
theocracy.' They know we live in a pluralistic society, but they
are also sincere in their faith.''

THE QUINTESSENTIAL CHRISTMAS HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIE HATFIELD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOODSTOCK, Vt. _ Picture a Christmas card showing the most
traditional New England home you can imagine. To be really
Christmasy, the house would be antique and white, of course, with
green shutters, and have a beautiful old front door covered in
greens with a classic green wreath in its center.
</P>
<P>
   This ideal Christmas-card house would be sitting on a
picturesque town green, and from the glow of its windows you could
make out an interior filled with beautiful antiques, Christmas
trees glistening with tiny white lights, and the hint of several
generations of an old and close family gathering there for the
holiday. It is, in short, the quintessential Christmas house.
</P>
<P>
   And it exists. Richard DiFrummolo and Donald Winter can go home
again; they call the Federal-style home they own here the
``Christmas House'' not only because it looks like what everyone
thinks of as the epitome of this holiday, but because, with all
their travels and their two other homes in Boston and Provincetown,
Christmas is the only time they are sure to be here.
</P>
<P>
   While the Provincetown house on the beach is the center of their
summer activities and is all light and clean contemporary
furniture, this 1810 clapboard home, which sits next door to the
town hall in the center of ski country, filled with old family
photos, odd nooks and crannies, and dark and beautiful antique
furniture, is where their extended family and many friends have
gathered for the Christmas holidays ever since they purchased it 15
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   There is a Christmas tree in practically every room of the
house, including one in the gigantic kitchen and a 16-foot one in
the huge room over the barn. DiFrummolo, a former owner of more
than a dozen hair salons and now the official family Christmas
decorating CEO, decorates everything in the house for the holiday,
and it is all subtle and tasteful and in perfect keeping with the
house. The trees _ green and living _ have tiny white lights and
red berries for decoration, the mantel of the front ``green room''
holds birch logs, natural greens, more red berries, and interesting
plant material from the area, and the front hall table, which was
designed by the two to just cover the radiator and yet leave room
for people to move through the hallway, holds two giant antique
glass urns filled with red ball ornaments. The urns, a gift for
DiFrummolo from Winter, came from an Ellis Memorial Antiques Show.
Winter, who is president of the Ellis Memorial and Eldredge House
Inc., says that ``at one time a gentleman kept whiskey in the urns
and probably poured a little more out for himself every time he
passed them.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``A house on the green'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the two men began looking for a place in Woodstock, they
told the real estate company they wanted a house on the town green;
that's the only place they considered for their front yard. For one
thing, Winter wanted a ski house for his three sons, who were then
teenagers. Two houses came available, and the other one was
purchased by Laurence Rockefeller.
</P>
<P>
   DiFrummolo and Winter's original plan was to live in the
enormous attached barn, originally a carriage house with horse
stalls and tack rooms on its lower floors and a large apartment on
the top floor, and sell the main house. ``Richard didn't even go
upstairs when we came to buy it, because we were supposedly living
in the barn,'' says Winter. To that end, they furnished the main
house sparsely at first, putting an antique chair here and there
when they found one at auction.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it grew on us; it evolved,'' says DiFrummolo. Originally
boasting a simple Federal style, the house was ``modernized'' with
what were considered up-to-date enhancements in the 1860s. Thus it
now sports elaborate gingerbread cornices just under the roof,
marble fireplaces, and red cabbage-rose wallpaper and carpeting,
some of which has been preserved. The most formal room, the right
front parlor, started out with the cabbage-rose wallpaper, but the
couple had it painted green and finally a pale yellow, to
complement the morning sunshine it receives. The room has a card
table bought at auction and an American corner cupboard from New
Orleans, in addition to a rose silk Chippendale rolled-arm
serpentine-back settee and a table made in this town. Family photos
fill the corner cupboard, and a floral painting hangs on the wall,
a thank-you gift from Jill Goldweitz of Boston to DiFrummolo for
decorating her apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the house one finds art from local painters,
including a primitive of Lake Champlain and paintings from
Vermonters Clead Enders, William B. Hoyt, and Janet Fredericks. In
a niche between the parlor and the library is a collection of
handblown glass from Winter's family. His grandmother's brothers
lived in Sweden and blew glass for Kosta, the well-known company
that made glass for Steuben, Dorflinger's, and both the Lincoln and
Wilson White Houses. There are vases that have been blown, then cut
and etched; a pair of gigantic Mercury glass candlesticks; a vase
of papier-mache and mother-of-pearl; and green and blue art-glass
vases that were made from leftover glass from the Kosta factory. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Interior renovations &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The library was made from an old kitchen and painted in a shade
that Winter calls ``cinnamon bear.'' The dining room has been
painted in the antique gold of Tuscany by a trompe l'oeil painter
the gentlemen discovered painting scenes in a local deli. The same
painter painted the dining room fireplace to look like stone, and
the wood floor to resemble tiles.
</P>
<P>
   A series of tiny, dark rooms was opened up to make one huge,
slightly more modern kitchen. By tearing down walls of back
hallways, the pantry, the original carriage shed, and the second
kitchen, and adding butcher block counters, a brick fireplace,
bookshelves, two dishwashers, and two sinks, DiFrummolo and Winter
ensured that the resulting space is big enough for Winter's dinners
for 40, for another Christmas tree piled high with gifts, and a
full dining table for family holiday breakfasts and brunches. In
another slightly contemporary touch to the holiday decor, the
kitchen tabletop is covered with a line of bowls, graduating from
small to large, each filled with red Christmas balls. The first
year they owned the house they had a Christmas party for all the
workers who helped restore the kitchen and other parts of the
house. Winter, who is adept at plumbing and electrical wiring, was
able to do much of that work on the house himself.
</P>
<P>
   They have left touches of the former kitchen, such as the three
bins that used to hold wheat, flour, and oats but now open out to
hold kitchen materials for recycling. And on the steps of the tiny
back staircase they had pictures of Vermont cows painted as a
whimsical afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   The four-bedrooms upstairs gradually became the master bedroom
and one for each of the Winter boys, which they have kept as their
own to this day, though each of them now brings a wife to those
rooms, and two little grandsons come with them. There is one tiny
bedroom left empty, and Winter optimistically put a flowery border
along the ceiling of the all-white room, which holds some of his
own baby toys from the '40s. ``It's for a future granddaughter,''
he explains, adding, ``They have to have a little girl at some
point, don't they?'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Barn room's special guests &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As they gradually moved into the large house and each son
considered one bedroom his own, the couple rented the barn room, to
which they had added many windows, to a series of artists,
screenwriters, and people going through divorces. When actor
Michael J. Fox got married, he and his wife Traci hid out here from
the media during their honeymoon. Three years ago on a perfect June
day, Winter's son Tony (whose ribbons from his childhood years of
competing with the Green Mountain Horse Association decorate the
barn) married Courtney Bent in St. James Episcopal Church across
the green from the house. They then took a few turns around the
green in a surrey, and retired to the tented backyard of the house,
which rolls gently down to the Ottaquechee River, for a reception
for hundreds of friends. The caterer, an old friend of Martha
Stewart's, had told the home-economics superstar about the wedding
plans, and, DiFrummolo said, ``Martha asked if she could come to
photograph the reception for one of her books.'' Telling Stewart
this was a personal family event, they turned her down. ``She would
have gone around restyling everything,'' scoffed DiFrummolo, who
added that Stewart was also not asked to the rehearsal dinner,
which took place in the barn room.
</P>
<P>
   While in the past the couple have invited guests here for as
many weekends as they could in the fall, Winter always had to rush
back to his job as partner at the law firm of Palmer &AMP; Dodge during
the week. But since his retirement a month ago, he's looking
forward to spending most of every fall, not to mention the holidays
of the future, ensconced right here with DiFrummolo in the
Christmas House.

FIESTA DISHES IT OUT FOR NEW MILLENNIUM
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: EMBARGOED until Saturday, Dec. 25)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Fiesta, which introduced its first solid-color tableware in
1936, has come up with a new design just in time for the new
century: Fiestaware 2000. In bright, jewel-toned colors of cobalt
blue, pearl gray, persimmon and juniper, the new dinnerware is
described by Jonathan Parry, creative director of the Homer
Laughlin China Co., as ``stylish, contemporary, irreverent,
casually modern ... architecturally more aggressive than
traditional Fiesta ... dinnerware with an attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   A new color will be introduced for a limited run every other
year.
</P>
<P>
   Made to mix and match with traditional Fiesta dinnerware, the
new dishes feature bold, right-angle designs that could be likened
to bamboo or lightning strikes. With a vitrified glaze that won't
absorb bacteria, Fiestaware 2000 is chip-resistant, retains heat
and cold, and is safe for use in the oven, refrigerator and
microwave.
</P>
<P>
   At varying prices, pieces _ including dinner, salad, fruit and
soup plates, oversized mugs, cereal bowls, water pitchers and
all-purpose utility plates _ the new dinnerware is available at
department and housewares stores. For more information about Fiesta
or Fiestaware 2000, check out www.hlchina.com on the Web. &QL;

   Child Caring's gift to parents this season is an expanded Q&AMP;A
devoted entirely to problems that can arise during the holidays.
Hopefully, there's a nugget or two here that will reduce your
seasonal stress. Of course, Child Caring also welcomes questions
throughout the year. Send yours to Barbara F. Meltz, Boston Globe,
Box 2378, Boston, MA 02107-2378 or Meltz(at)globe.com.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do I teach my 2.9-year-old son to graciously accept a
Christmas gift even if it is something he already has or does not
like? I want him to show respect for the gift giver's feelings and
appreciation for the gift no matter what it is. I dread him saying
``Is that all there is?'' as he did on his second birthday.
</P>
<P>
   A. Practice what you want him to say and make a game out of it:
``What do you say when you get a present?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, I like it soooooooo much!''
</P>
<P>
   ``What if you already have the very same thing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I still say `Thannk youuuu!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Steel yourself, nonetheless, for the fact that he's only 2.
There will be times when he'll say, ``Thank you sooo much but I
hate this,'' and times when he'll dig his heels in and just say,
``No!'' In those moments, remind him of the rule: ``Remember how we
practiced saying thank you?''
</P>
<P>
   Even if that doesn't prompt a thank-you, it reinforces your
expectation. Perhaps equally important for family peace, it shows
Aunt Mary that you are trying to teach good manners. Keep in mind
also that young children easily get overwhelmed and overstimulated
during the holidays. Getting into a power struggle over thank-you
will only make matters worse.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Q. New Year's Eve parties for teens make me nervous, this year
especially. What are some reasonable guidelines for parents whose
teens want to do it up big for the millennium?
</P>
<P>
   A. Kate Kelly, author of ``The Complete Idiot's Guide to
Parenting a Teenager'' (Alpha Books), has three teens herself.
Here's how she's coping:
</P>
<P>
   --Her college-age daughter has permission to go to a party at
the home of a family Kelly knows well, with kids she also knows and
guidelines clearly established: no alcohol (not even champagne), no
driving around to pick up kids who live two suburbs away. The
parents will be home and in evidence, and most kids will spend the
night. ``This group is a bunch of pals, and they've been through
overnights at proms together. I'm totally comfortable with this,''
says Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   --Her 15-year-old wants to do something ``special'' but so far
has no plan. ``I told her I'll remain open until the last minute,
but the plan needs to be very specific and safe, not a bunch of
kids roaming around looking for something,'' says Kelly. ``She
knows I'll pull rank because I've told her her safety is more
important than her being able to remember she was at some
questionable event on the millennium New Year.'' Will this be an
issue? ``Down to the wire,'' she predicts. But she's providing an
alternative: ``She can invite a friend to our house, where we will
have a few friends in to celebrate.''
</P>
<P>
   --The 11-year-old so far is the most unhappy. ``She's been
invited to a party and she has permission to stay until 10:30. I've
told her that even on the millennium, 11-year-olds should not be at
a party until midnight,'' says Kelly. This daughter is also welcome
to invite a friend over.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's general advice is to be tighter with the reins, not
looser: ``Don't let them do anything this night that they couldn't
do any other night.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. This year, Christmas is not a happy time for our family: My
father is dying. Do we try to make it a normal Christmas for all
the grandchildren _ seven of them, ages 3 through 13 _ or do we say
we're really sad and basically ignore it? My two siblings and I
can't agree.
</P>
<P>
   A. Canceling Christmas would be unnatural and too sad for the
grandchildren. On the other hand, it's not fair or appropriate for
grief-stricken adults to act as if nothing is wrong. The operative
term is ``scale back,'' says grief therapist Maria Trozzi, founder
and director of the Good Grief Program at Boston Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Her recommendation is for parents to acknowledge to their
children that although they're looking forward to Christmas because
it's so wonderful, it will also be sad this year because Grandpa is
dying. If you haven't already been this honest with the children,
it will be a hard conversation, but don't avoid it, even with the
youngest child. ``Honesty within an age-appropriate framework is
what most enables children to cope,'' says Trozzi, who is the
author of ``Talking With Children About Loss'' (Perigee Books.)
</P>
<P>
   While you don't want to cancel Christmas, do cancel your annual
holiday open house for 200; focus instead on being together as an
extended family. By all means, decorate your houses; you could
offer to help Grandma decorate hers too, if she seems interested.
Honor the traditions, songs, and foods Grandpa loves; if it's
possible, visit him on Christmas with small gifts and letters of
love.
</P>
<P>
   Trozzi followed her own advice 10 years ago when her father died
on Christmas morning. She had canceled a traditional Christmas Eve
party, and the extended family spent the evening at her father's
bedside, where he supervised distribution of mementos to the
grandchildren. Trozzi's son, who was 5 at the time, received a box
of World War II medals. That grandson is 15 now, and the box still
holds a place of honor on his bureau. ``He always refers to it as
his grandfather's last Christmas gift,'' Trozzi says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do we keep our 2-year-old from destroying the Christmas
tree? Half the ornaments look like toys; others are fragile. I hate
the thought of not using them.
</P>
<P>
   A. Some families are able to get away with putting fragile
ornaments out of reach, at the top of the tree, and nonfragile ones
within reach. For some kids, though, that will still be too much
temptation. Bite the bullet and put your best ones away for a year
or two. Instead, have fun together creating a totally
child-friendly tree by making and hanging decorations. Better
still, put control of the tree in his hands. If you don't own a
remote-control switch for the tree lights, consider splurging on
one. It'll be worth it to see the joy on his face at being in
charge of turning the tree on and off. (Hopefully, you won't have
to splurge for a video camera to capture the moment!)

   Q. I have two boys, ages 7 and 10. For three years in a row the
older one has asked for PlayStation or Nintendo for Christmas. He
could manage this gift. However, his younger brother has ADHD
(attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder) and has a sensory
integration problem. He would be addicted to this sort of toy, and
I am not willing to take on more battles with this or spend the
energy trying to limit usage. My older son does not know that this
is the real reason behind this issue. I know he'll be greatly
disappointed once again, although I have told him not to get his
hopes up.
</P>
<P>
   A. It sounds as if you've made a good decision for good reasons,
but your older son deserves to know your reasoning too; lack of
honesty will only build resentment toward you and/or his brother,
since siblings typically are far more aware of the issues that we
realize.
</P>
<P>
   Parent educator Linda Braun, excecutive director of Families
First Parenting Programs in Cambridge, suggests taking him aside
for a conversation that goes something like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this is something you really want. I've been trying to
figure out how we could make it work in our family, but as you
know, your brother struggles with limits. Your dad and I feel this
would just cause too many problems in our home.''

<P>
   The danger, of course, is that this lays blame on the brother,
``but this is also the reality of your family,'' says Braun. ``A
child can learn to cope as long as his needs are getting met. Not
that he gets everything he wants, but that his feelings and wishes
are acknowledged.'' She says you can go on to say ``This is a
difficult thing to explain to you, because we don't want you to be
angry with your brother. But we know that you are an understanding
person and that you know this would be too hard for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only are you opening up channels of communication and
empathy, but you are also conveying an important value: ``Being a
family sometimes means that one person's needs take precedence over
another's.''

   Q. My daughter is turning 9 and asking if Santa is real or not.
The way she puts it makes us feel as if she's accusing us of having
lied to her (arms akimbo, belligerent tone), so we're not sure how
to answer. It is a lie, but it never felt that way to us. Plus, we
have a younger child who still believes.
</P>
<P>
   A. There are typically two ways children approach the ``is Santa
real'' issue. One is to ask skeptical questions: How can he deliver
so many presents in one night? How does he fit through a chimney?
If she's easily satisfied with a
``He's-magical-he-can-do-all-that'' answer, she's testing but
wanting to believe just a little bit longer.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds as if your daughter has moved beyond this stage to the
next, where she is more confrontational and where keeping the truth
from her is disrespectful. As for whether it's a lie, don't even go
there; the fantasy of Santa serves many purposes for young
children, including being a source of comfort and security.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some openings for a conversation:
</P>
<P>
   --Acknowledge that he isn't real but talk about how you still
enjoy the fun and fantasy of Santa, even as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   --Do you remember how you felt when you realized Santa wasn't
real? Sharing that will help her see this as a rite of passage.
</P>
<P>
   --Talk about Santa as a symbol of the spirit of giving.
</P>
<P>
   --Talk about being respectful of younger siblings: ``Your sister
still believes. We don't want to spoil it for her.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do I respond when my preschooler receives a gift I feel
is inappropriate, like a toy gun?
</P>
<P>
   A. The best response is a proactive one: Tell friends and
relatives how you feel. Also tell your child, says early childhood
educator and author Diane Levin of Wheelock College, who researches
children's toys.
</P>
<P>
   You can begin with a toddler, even if you do it for the first
time the day before Christmas, as an insurance policy: ``Do you
know that in our family, we don't believe in playing with toy guns?
Some children and some adults don't like toy guns because they make
people think you might want to hurt them for real.'' Then, if he
unwraps a toy Uzi on Christmas morning and looks at you with wide
eyes, you have a context for talking about it: ``I bet you're
remembering that we don't like toy guns in our family. Why don't we
put this toy aside for now? Tomorrow, we'll talk about what we can
do about the gun so everybody is happy.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as Levin opposes violent toys, she's also a realist.
When tomorrow comes (or if he doesn't want to put the gun away
now), her position is to compromise, partly because the gun has
made it into your home and partly because you can't cut a child off
forever from the culture. However, she urges talking about the
reasons you don't like toy guns, including not only that they make
you think about real guns, which can kill people, but also that
they are boring toys because there are so few ways to play with
them.
</P>
<P>
   Levin has written several books about children's play, including
``The War Play Dilemma'' with co-author Nancy Carlsson-Paige
(Teachers' College Press) and ``Remote Control Childhood?'' (NAEYC
Press).
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Q. For a while I thought it was my imagination that every time
the subject of Y2K came up, my preschooler would get anxious. But
now my in-laws and others have noticed it too. Is this possible,
and if it is, what can I do about it?
</P>
<P>
   A. Kids pick up on all sorts of things we say, but because they
don't have the cognitive equipment to deal with the information,
they react to our tone and emotion. Even if you haven't talked
about possible Y2K problems, a preschooler might have heard the
worried tones of a radio or TV announcer. The best way to help is
to get the issue on the table: ``I noticed when Uncle John talked
about Y2K, you seemed anxious. Do you know what Y2K is?''
</P>
<P>
   Even if he says yes, ask him what it means and then clarify; for
instance, ``Well, Y2K is something people are talking about. It's a
birthday party for the world, which is moving from 1,999 years on
our calendar to 2,000 years. That's a long time!'' Be concrete:
Show on a calendar how it is 1999 now and it will soon be 2000.
Some other coping mechanisms: Plan a Y2K breakfast together, make
``2000'' place cards and decorations.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is giving him too much information. If he seems
interested, keep going: ``It's a happy celebration, but some people
are worried that computers will crash in the new year. Have you
heard that? It means they might break. In our family, we've fixed
our computers so that won't happen.'' When he's had enough, he'll
turn away, but be prepared for him to come back to it at another
time: You've made the topic talkable. For most kids, the answer
they want to hear is that you're taking care of your family, and
that they are safe.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My child's best friend is getting a horse for Christmas and a
Millennium Barbie. We have far less to spend, but our child is very
conscious of the discrepancy. How do we talk about it in a way that
won't make her feel awful, not to mention poor?
</P>
<P>
   A. If what she wants most in the world is a horse, there's no
answer that will make her happy. Nonetheless, this is as an
opportunity to talk about your family values for the holidays, says
child psychologist Roni Leiderman, associate dean of the Family and
School Center at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale.
She offers this approach:
</P>
<P>
   --Reflect her wish: ``I know you really want a horse.''
</P>
<P>
   --Acknowledge the reality of the situation _ ``A horse just
isn't something we can afford'' _ but don't dwell on the money and
stop short of apologizing: ``I'm sorry we can't get you one''; that
only makes your gifts seem inferior.
</P>
<P>
   --Model generosity of spirit _ ``Isn't that wonderful that Mary
is getting a horse? She must be so excited!'' _ but don't expect
her to necessarily buy into it.
</P>
<P>
   --Talk about the special presents she will get _ ``There are
some presents we hope you will really like'' _ and the true meaning
of Christmas: ``It's about sharing what we have, and being with
family and friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiderman stresses that this is not a one-shot conversation.
``It's a process,'' she says. ``This is a life lesson that takes a
long time to teach and to learn.''

VENTURE CAPITAL BUSINESS SOARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We are all venture capitalists now.
</P>
<P>
   OK, that's an exaggeration. But not much of one. The venture
capital business is booming. An estimated $30 billion will be
invested nationally in new ventures this year, a tenfold increase
since the start of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   More remarkable than the growth in dollars is the growth in the
number and nature of the investors. Simply put, corporate America
is jumping into the venture business in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   According to Steven Galante, publisher of Venture Capital and
Information Technology, a Wellesley, Mass. newsletter, 160
companies now have venture capital operations, up from 70 two years
ago. Technology companies and consulting firms are leading the way.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen Consulting recently announced the creation of a $1
billion venture capital fund. A few days later, rival consulting
firm EDS said it was setting up a $1.5 billion venture fund.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, EMC, the Hopkinton data storage firm, is
making venture investments. So are Cognex, RSA Security, Breakaway
Solutions, and Cambridge Technology Partners, a mix of small and
medium-size companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect to see McDonald's establish a venture capital fund
any day now, with Ronald McDonald handing out money to
entrepreneurs,'' said Todd Dagres, a venture capitalist with
Battery Ventures in Wellesley, only half in jest.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't hard to figure out why everyone and his brother wants
to get into Dagres's business. Like bank robber Willie Sutton, they
want to be where the money is.
</P>
<P>
   Dagres's firm made an early investment in Akamai Technologies, a
Cambridge Internet company. That original $5 million investment
today is worth close to $3 billion, a 600-fold increase. The Akamai
deal is amazing even by venture standards, but there have been
plenty of other success stories.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI, based in Andover, has achieved a market value of more than
$30 billion, largely because of its venture investments in dozens
of start-ups. Internet Capital Group, a Pennsylvania company with a
similar business model, is now worth more than $40 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Who wouldn't want a piece of the action?
</P>
<P>
   But the new players in the venture business say they are after
more than just money. What is it they want?
</P>
<P>
   --Access to cutting-edge technology. ``Our investments give us a
window into some of the new things happening in our field,'' said
Charles Stuckey, chief executive of RSA Security, a Bedford company
that specializes in computer security.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, RSA made a small investment in a start-up called
VeriSign. VeriSign works with digital certificates, a piece of the
security business in which RSA had no experience. RSA has since
produced its own digital certificate product, in part, by licensing
VeriSign technology.
</P>
<P>
   It also doesn't hurt that VeriSign has become a very hot company
and RSA's original investment is now worth nearly $700 million. RSA
since has invested in half a dozen security start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   For technology companies like RSA, venture investing is a
relatively cheap form of research and development. For a modest
price they get a chance to see what the rest of the world is up to.
Cisco Systems, one of the nation's most successful high-tech
companies, has made a large number of venture investments; in some
cases, Cisco subsequently has acquired companies whose technology
looked especially promising.
</P>
<P>
   --Sales to new customers. Breakaway Solutions, a Boston
e-consulting firm, just this week announced the creation of a
venture fund that will put money into fledgling dot-com companies
that also happen to be Breakaway clients. ``It is a way of aligning
our goals with our customers,'' said Gordon Brooks, Breakaway's
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   In short, if the customer does well, Breakaway should do well,
too.
</P>
<P>
   EMC had adopted the same strategy on a small scale. The data
storage giant has made some selected investments in dot-com
companies ``that have the potential to be large users of storage,''
said EMC spokesman Mark Fredrickson.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans of the venture-capital business are not surprised to
see the flood of new entrants into their industry. ``This is all
part of the cycle,'' said Tim Barrows, a top executive at Matrix
Partners, a Waltham venture firm with an excellent track record.
``Returns have been high and that attracts a lot of new capital.
We've got too much capital in the system right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically, too many players and too much capital leads to
high prices and eventually, poor returns. ``Obviously, the returns
that venture capitalists are earning are not sustainable,'' said
Steven Gallante, the newsletter publisher. ``They will come down.
How far? I don't know.''

<P>
   I pull up to the pumps and walk inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, that's a nice-looking car,'' says Irving.
</P>
<P>
   ``How's the sound system?'' asks son Matt, looking up from the
study guide for his upcoming test on the new auto inspection
equipment. ``I hear it's really something special.''
</P>
<P>
   I flip Matt the key and watch him crank up the windows and sound
on the four-disc, in-dash CD changer that's part of a 360-watt
system with Infinity speakers in nine locations. As I walk out to
finish gassing up, the smile on his face tells all as he leans back
in the seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got it right,'' he says as he relinquishes the car in
exchange for gas money.
</P>
<P>
   That applies to more than the sound system.
</P>
<P>
   This is the big car your father always wanted to drive, except
it's only been built for the last two years. And it is right.
</P>
<P>
   It's also big. And stylish. And comfortable. And powerful. And
luxurious. And built in America.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, and it's fun to drive.
</P>
<P>
   And for you, the son or daughter? All of the above holds true,
too.
</P>
<P>
   The LHS, a sibling of Chrysler's performance-oriented 300M, has
plenty of strong selling points of its own. Under the hood, they
share the same 3.5-liter, 24-valve V6 that puts out 253 horsepower,
enough to get an LHS from 0-60 in 7.7 seconds with good economy (18
m.p.g. city and 27 highway).
</P>
<P>
   The LHS is a little longer than the 300M, offers a softer (but
not spongy) ride, has more interior and trunk space and comes at a
decent price: $28,090 (ours added the CD changer at $515 and
17-inch chrome wheels at $750).
</P>
<P>
   The styling _ as it is across the Chrysler line _ is stunning,
and the reliability in these big cars is encouraging. The black
(heated) mirrors and a black trim strip between the hood and
windshield offset the bright silver of our test car. The LHS shares
the retro-look, airplane-styled dash instrumentation of the 300M,
including an analog clock (we won't argue with Chrysler's claim
that the cluster is reminiscent of Swiss-made watches).
</P>
<P>
   On the road, a trip with four aboard to Worcester saw the LHS
cruise easily at 80 and hold the road just fine. In town, where the
Central Artery is a tougher test, a late-night drive home on a
rainy night saw the suspension hop through the ruts a bit but
perform nicely overall.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't cold enough that week for the wet roads to turn to
black ice that would test the traction control, but, returning home
from the Globe in the wee hours one Sunday night, I got to give the
four-wheel disc brakes and antilock braking system a real-life
test.
</P>
<P>
   As I came onto the Expressway North at Columbia Road, an Acura
and Honda raced past, door handle to door handle in excess of 90
mph, rapidly disappearing from sight. A mile or so down the road,
they came a cropper in the South Station Tunnel, leaving a trail of
metal, plastic, glass and vital (automotive) fluids all over the
road with one car against each wall. The young lady driving the
Honda already had crossed over and was ``communicating'' with the
Acura driver who seemed OK but was unable to open the well-battered
driver's side door.
</P>
<P>
   The LHS made a quick, straight, pedal-pulsating stop, then
gingerly followed an 18-wheeler through the mess. A call to 911
went unanswered, leaving the conclusion that the trucker already
had officialdom on the phone. Ten minutes later, WBZ's traffic
report relayed news of a multicar crash in the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the LHS seemed removed from the fray.
</P>
<P>
   Family and friends who came along during the week commented
favorably on the ride, the styling and the roominess of the
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The leather seats were comfortable and heated. Heated seats
always sounded like a ``Who needs 'em?'' amenity _ until I tried
them. They're one of life's welcome luxuries, and just this week I
heard of a driver who uses his all year to ease a chronically
aching back.
</P>
<P>
   The obligatory cupholder report: Hit a bar on the front of the
center armrest and a double cupholder pops out. It was fine for our
various test beverages: a medium cardboard coffee cup, a soda can,
and an insulated travel mug, keeping them safely within reach and
out of the way of all controls.
</P>
<P>
   The equally-obligatory owner's manual report: You'll need to
read it to fully understand the many features of the
climate-control and audio-CD systems. Only a true gadget-person
will figure them out completely without help.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   --Power, styling, spaciousness, combination of ride and
handling.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --No easy place to put a turnpike toll ticket (the CD changer
took care of any in-dash cubbyhole spaces).
</P>
<P>
   --It took time to get the seat/mirror adjustments just right.
And rearview mirror visibility was somewhat limited.

THE BEST OF '99 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With thousands of miles logged in many cars, trucks, and SUVs
from when this journey began and my first calendar year as auto
writer closing, this is a good time to look back at what I liked
most in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   When I test a car, I always ask myself what sort of driver the
car is intended for and if it will suit that person.
</P>
<P>
   Ultra-expensive vehicles exclude lots of readers since most of
us can't afford them, but the vicarious sharing we get to do makes
for interesting columns, as your e-mail and letters tell me.
</P>
<P>
   Vehicles priced in the mid-range raise lots of questions these
days because picking among those from $23,000 to $40,000 can be
tricky. Quality, comfort, and performance can be found across this
entire price spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   At the lower end of the cost scale, cheap doesn't necessarily
mean badly built and unreliable anymore. In fact, almost no one is
building a bad vehicle these days.
</P>
<P>
   So, these are my favorites from the past year _ in no particular
order but saving my top choice for last:
</P>
<P>
   Ford Focus _ Finally, an American car to compete with the Honda
Civic and Toyota Corolla _ and maybe do them one better. The Focus,
in three basic models (three-door, four-door sedan and station
wagon) is roomy, economical, and sporty. Its sharp lines give it an
edgy European look; its interior is surprisingly large; and, with a
130-horsepower engine coupled with a five-speed standard
transmission, it was downright snappy. Cost: $12,000-$16,000.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan Maxima _ Right now, the best bang-for-the-buck on the
market. At less than $25,000, it is bigger, more powerful, and
handles better than ever. It's got a great 222 horsepower V-6, a
sporty feel when driving, and is in a league of its own at this
price.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen Jetta GLS VR6 _ A solid car: solid suspension, solid
braking, solid acceleration, solid seats. Aimed at young drivers,
it's not quite a pocket rocket and not quite a sports sedan, but
that's its appeal. It too is snappy, tight in turns, roomy, and fun
to drive. Cost: $19,950-$24,000.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguar XKR _ Supercharged, powerful, stunning on the straights,
and catlike on the curves. It's a sports car that seats four, and
if you can afford a Porsche 911, the Mercedes SL500, or the Acura
NSX, this classic Jaguar, powered by 370 horses, should be on your
comparison list. Cost: $76,800.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes E55 AMG _ My favorite Mercedes, this sports sedan is
specially prepared by AMG with a 349-horsepower engine that propels
it from 0-60 in 5.7 seconds and, at high revs, sounds like a big
ol' muscle car. It's got sophisticted suspension _ gas shocks, coil
springs, antidive devices, stabilizer bars, antisquat devices _ and
supersmart Automatic Slip Control and Electronic Stability Control
that lets it handle all that power. Cost: about $73,000.
</P>
<P>
   Audi TT _ This crouched bug drew more attention than anything
else I drove all year. Kinda retro, kinda airplane-like, lots of
fun. Its 1.3-liter turbocharged engine (with no turbo lag) zips it
from 0-60 in 6.9 seconds. The car clings to corners as if it's on a
railroad track. It's a tight fit inside _ a car you wear _ but when
you're in there, you are in charge of your domain. Cost: $32,900.
</P>
<P>
   Porsche C4 _ Subtle, as a Porsche can be. Wicked quick, as a
Porsche can be. Wicked fast, as a Porsche can be. Tiptronic
transmission that really let's you feel like you are shifting
(using buttons on the steering wheel, no less) and a Porsche
Stability Management system that will not let you cause the car to
fishtail _ unless you turn it off, and let the real fun begin.
Cost: $83,822.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota Tundra _ For quality, comfort, quiet, and power, this is
the best pickup truck being built today. It doesn't have the raw
rumble of the Fords, Chevys, or Dodges, but its Lexus-based engine
will last longer than any plant in any of those rigs. Get it with
four doors and seating for five or six and you've got the perfect
combo for today's living: an SUV with a rear pickup truck bed.
Cost: $29,693.
</P>
<P>
   Ford SVT F-150 Lightning _ Forget common sense. Let's return to
the wonder years of big block American steel with a supercharger
strapped on for brute power. It rumbles, it roars, it burns rubber
with the flick of a foot. For truck enthusiasts who would like to
leave yuppies and their whining foreign performance cars in the
rearview mirror, this is just the beast. Cost: $30,450.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan Xterra _ And speaking of returning, let's return to those
thrilling days of yesteryear when SUVs actually went off-road. When
they were spartan, utilitarian, and affordable. The Xterra takes
you there in an angular box that's meant to be ridden hard and put
away wet. Racks, bins, and tie-down spots for equipment abound.
Perfect for those who want an SUV they'll really use. Cost:
$21,499-23,297.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln LS/Chyrsler 300M _ OK, so it's two cars, but what they
represent is important: classy, comfortable, high-performance
American luxury sedans that can give the Europeans a run for their
money. The LS (full review coming next week) is the more luxurious
of the two, the 300M the car with the greatest sense of sportiness.
Costs: Lincoln, $39,105; 300M, $30,560.
</P>
<P>
   Acura NSXT _ And now it comes to this . . . of all the cars I
have driven this year, which would I like to find sitting, free of
charge, in my driveway tomorrow morning? It's got to be this
crouched aluminum rocket. Is it as fine a car as the Porsche C4? In
most folk's eyes, probably not. But is it more fun to drive? Can
you feel the road _ as in every crack in pavement or stray pebble _
through the wheel? Do you feel, once you are lowered into the
driver's seat, that you could gas it up and head for the West Coast
at high speed? Yes, to all of these questions, and that's why it's
my favorite. Cost: $88,814.

CHRISTMAS IS A STATE OF MIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A &UR;  &LR; mere 24 hours until Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   How do you want to spend them?
</P>
<P>
   Some of us will follow the tradition of Last Minute Shopping,
taking this one last day to fight the crowds, looking for the
perfect gift. We'll tell ourselves we haven't done enough, remind
ourselves how much everyone expects from us, convince ourselves
each object we purchase as a token of our love will prove how much
we care.
</P>
<P>
   If this is the choice you've made, admire your own perseverance.
Celebrate this remarkable display of effort so close to the finish
line. Don't scatter your energies feeling angry, or sorry for
yourself, or put upon by all those folks demanding this sacrifice
of time and money. The secret of perfect happiness is never to
allow the way you feel to countermand the actions you take. Honor
the part of you that consciously made this decision, the part that
revels in an extravaganza of gifts. To give with a recalcitrant
heart is to sow the seeds of misery.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us learn this the hard way, by seeing how we taint
everything we touch when we refuse to take responsibility for our
own choice of action. The people on whose behalf we say we act
resent the false smiles we muster while radiating victimhood. Only
when we say yes with our own voices and accept that we do so of our
own volition does the joy of the season have a chance to enter us.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us will follow the tradition of Do It Yourself, having
taken this holiday as an opportunity to transform oranges into
ribboned candlesticks and make elaborate gingerbread houses. We'll
have baked cookies, draped the stairs with evergreens, sent out
family photographs, and put the ornaments we made on the tree we
cut down ourselves. Still to go _ finishing a handmade sweater and
Christmas dinner from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   If this is the choice you've made, give yourself credit for
fighting the materialistic spirit of our age. Be impressed by your
refusal to accept commercial substitutes for your own creative
energy. Don't scatter your energy, trying to complete the list
you've constructed in your head. The secret of perfect happiness is
to place what you want to do within the reasonable limits of your
time and energy. Remember, it isn't how much you do; it's the
ability to radiate loving-kindness as you do it. To compress too
much into too little space is asking for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us learn this the hard way, by making too many promises,
and starting too many projects. The people for whom we say we're
doing this feel marginalized by our preoccupations and upset by our
agitation. Only when we take one breath at a time and focus on
being centered rather than productive does the spirit of the season
have a chance to fill us.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the '90s tradition of No Big Deal, which means that
some of us pull out the old aluminum tree and hang the standard red
balls on it. We'll have ordered boxes of oranges for everyone over
50 on our Christmas list and bought a book for everyone else. Our
kids are getting gift certificates, our mates a kiss under
imaginary mistletoe. All that's left now is to order Chinese food
and watch a seasonal video.
</P>
<P>
   If this is the choice you've made, enjoy every minute of leisure
you can gather. Pat yourself on the back for escaping the frenzy,
for rejecting the conventional, for refusing to accept the shame
heaped on those who refuse to play the game according to the rules
of commerce and religion. Don't waste your energy cursing the way
others have yielded to the excesses of the season. The secret of
perfect happiness is to focus on the patterns of living that bring
you satisfaction and let the rest become background, like a distant
aurora borealis.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us learn this the hard way, by letting our attention
wander to the past or focusing on disturbing examples of capitalism
run amok. The people for whom we care will happily do without
ceremony if we are attentive, attuned to the present moment, and
available to them. Only by shutting out the noise of the
marketplace can we make space for the cultivation of our own souls.
</P>
<P>
   With only 24 hours to go, it's important to remember that, in
the midst of all our preparation, the only goal worth pursuing is a
state of mind _ that is, to arrive at Christmas Eve with a heart
overflowing with anticipation. There can be no magic without the
cultivation of inner delight, no pleasure without inner
peacefulness, no treasured moments to remember without an inner
eye, gazing out from the silence within at the splendor of the day.

MUSIC MOVES THE `MOUNTAIN' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ Most people who read ``Cold Mountain'' saw it as a
great epic set in the Civil War. But Tim O'Brien and Dirk Powell
were thrilled by the references to the traditional Southern music
that the author Charles Frazier had scattered throughout it.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing notes at a Folk Alliance conference last winter in
Memphis, O'Brien and Powell found that they were both thinking
about recording the old ballads and dance tunes found in the novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who plays this music, and knows the book, is going to
be interested'' in the CD that O'Brien (on guitar) and Powell (on
fiddle) made this year with banjo player John Herrmann, O'Brien
said in an interview at his home here.
</P>
<P>
   But recording the music inspired by the book proved to be more
challenging that they had thought: Their CD, ``Songs from the
Mountain,'' got hung up by legal wrangling and distribution
miscues, and it remains in the hard-to-find category.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of a comedy,'' O'Brien said. His wife, Kit Swaggert,
who serves as CEO of Howdy Skies Records, the company O'Brien and
Powell formed to record the music, was blunter: ``It got really
messy when we started dealing with Hollywood lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   And that was despite the fact that Frazier was fully behind the
project, having spent years listening to traditional musicians as
he researched the book _ and knowing full well the use he was
making of music in the novel.
</P>
<P>
   What Frazier had planted _ and what had struck a chord with
O'Brien and Powell _ were a major character who is a fiddler,
important scenes built around music, and brief phrases taken from
traditional ballads.
</P>
<P>
   A powerful scene finds the fiddler Stobrod, and a young boy who
plays the banjo, captured by a Confederate vigilante unit whose
commander asks them to ``pick me something'' before they are
executed. They play _ and O'Brien, Powell, and Herrmann record _ a
rousing version of ``Bonaparte's Retreat'' and then ``Washington's
March,'' a tune, Frazier writes, ``grim as death.''
</P>
<P>
   But even more intriguing for O'Brien and Powell were the lines
from traditional ballads that appear frequently in the thoughts of
Inman, the book's central character.
</P>
<P>
   From the song ``The Drunkard's Hiccups'' comes the line: ``If I
could sprout wings and fly.'' The line ``You can tramp down those
flowers all around my grave but they'll rise and bloom again''
comes from ``Raleigh and Spencer,'' a rousing piece that Frazier
had heard played by a North Carolina fiddler, Tommy Jarrell, whom
he has identified as one of his models for the character of
Stobrod.
</P>
<P>
   What Frazier did _ in addition to going to fiddlers' conventions
_ was to listen to the oldest available recordings from long-gone
performers as a way to echo as much as possible the speech patterns
of Southerners at the time of the Civil War. Music, he has said,
provided ``the straightest line of accessibility to that old
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   But getting that music out of the book and onto a CD ``was a
textbook of how things can go wrong,'' O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   The Howdy Skies team quickly learned that all rights to ``Cold
Mountain'' had been sold to MGM-UA for a projected motion picture.
</P>
<P>
   The deal that was finally struck after lengthy negotiations was
that Howdy Skies could not use the title ``Cold Mountain'' on the
CD album cover _ hence ``Songs from the Mountain'' _ although that
title could be used in the liner notes.
</P>
<P>
   But a larger obstacle was the stipulation that the CD could be
sold only as a package with the paperback edition of the novel,
which had just been released. ``I think they saw that as a way to
sell more books,'' O'Brien said, ``because we had to buy 2,500
copies to package with the first pressing of the CD.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem there was that when the book-CD package arrived in
record stores, the obvious customers for the CD had already read
the book in hardcover, and thus they balked at buying the
paperback.
</P>
<P>
   Even after that obstacle was overcome and Howdy Skies was able
to market the CD separately, a glitch at the distributor prevented
many record stores from getting their orders filled.
</P>
<P>
   Things have now been straightened out sufficiently to encourage
a new pressing, Swaggert said. But Howdy Skies can sell its ``Songs
from the Mountain'' only through the end of 2000, because that was
the expected release date for the projected motion picture.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, O'Brien and his fellow musicians dream of being
invited to do the soundtrack, pinning their hopes on an endorsement
from the author.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Swaggert said, Frazier took director Anthony
Minghella for a drive through the mountains of western North
Carolina and played a cassette of Dirk Powell performing
traditional Appachian music on the car's tape deck.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' Frazier told Minghella, ``is what I want the music in
the film to sound like.''

 PRINCETON, N.J.: ... people skills.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I think he's actually become less pugilistic in recent
years,'' says Reich, who declined to talk about Krugman's fallout
with the Clinton team. ``Paul seems more interested in going after
ideas than people, which is a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing what I now know about myself, no. I would not have
given me a job in the early Clinton administration,'' says Krugman.
``I would have been too much at odds with people whose views I
didn't respect, like Reich and Magaziner.''
</P>
<P>
   Economist Lawrence Summers, who now runs the Treasury
Department, is so famously contemptuous of other economists that
``he makes me look like sweet forgiveness,'' says Krugman. ``But
Larry wants the position in a way I never did. I would have been a
disaster. Listen, you have to know who you are. My most important
collaborator, Elhanan Helpman, just turned down the Bank of Israel
job. Not for lack of intellect, but because he knew it was wrong
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Krugman, who has no children, is married to Robin Wells, an
economist hired by MIT in 1996 as part of a package deal that
brought Krugman back east from Stanford. His first marriage, to
Robin Bergman, a clothing designer, ended in divorce. He and Wells
live in North Cambridge, at least for now. Krugman acknowledges
that one purpose of the Princeton sojourn was to explore job
possibilities. ``There might be a good fit there; they have some
needs,'' he says. ``We're just talking.''
</P>
<P>
   Off campus, he and Wells enjoy what Krugman calls ``fairly small
vices'' such as gourmet cooking and summer bicycle trips to Europe.
For relaxation, he turns to pulp fiction and popular science books
_ and tries to enforce a rule against any economics after 6 p.m. at
home.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Krugman began a new career phase by writing articles
for Foreign Affairs. In the six years since, he says, his focus has
gradually shifted away from pure research, in specialized fields
like economic geography, toward more of a synthesis of the
scholarly and the popular, now culminating in the Times
appointment. Krugman concedes it is a trade-off that sparks envy in
some, scorn in others, and conflict within himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to be what they're not,'' he avers.
``Academics want real influence, policy makers are interested in
what they're going to do after they leave office, and businessmen
want to be respected for their minds. Obviously there are great
research economists out there who wonder why they can't get into
The New York Times. On the other hand, there are people like me who
wake up in the wee hours of the morning thinking, `Gosh, what
insights have I missed while I've been busy meeting deadlines?'
It's good not to get too complacent.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems obvious to bring up the example of John Kenneth
Galbraith, the protean Harvard economist with the famously popular
touch. Obvious, perhaps, until Krugman dismisses it with the same
contempt he has heaped upon peers like Lester Thurow, Krugman's
colleague in the MIT economics department.
</P>
<P>
   Galbraith is ``an interestingly funny example, because he was
never taken seriously by professional economists as a professional
economist,'' says Krugman. ``Like it or not, you wouldn't find
Galbraith on a graduate-student reading list. There's no Galbraith
Model still out there that people need to learn. So I did not
detect a lot of yearning to become the next Galbraith among PhD
economists. There are probably more wanting to become the next Paul
Krugman now, because they've seen that someone who is actually on
the grad school reading list can do that sort of thing too.''
</P>
<P>
   It is comments such as these that prompt others to paint Krugman
as ``arrogant'' and ``smug,'' even while conceding his talent and
writing ability. In 1996, Robert Kuttner wrote a scolding essay in
The American Prospect titled ``Peddling Krugman.'' In the piece,
Kuttner called Krugman _ a onetime contributor to the Prospect _
``the conservative's ideal liberal'' and accused him of, among
other sins, hypocrisy, lack of commitment to teaching duties, and
making the world safer for political and fiscal conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Krugman's world,'' wrote Kuttner, ``if bizarre arguments
are dressed up in formal models, they pass muster as economic
science, even if they turn out to be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuttner says he had more fun deconstructing Krugman than with
any other piece he's written. And he is disappointed the Times did
not make a more unconventional choice to fill its op-ed slot. With
Krugman appearing on the same page as Friedman, says Kuttner, ``The
Times' op-ed page will now run the gamut from A to B in its
diversity of views on political economics. Paul's clever, and he
writes well. But so much of his career has been spent as an
enforcer of boundaries, of who's mainstream and who's
conventional.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is late afternoon, and Krugman is addressing an overflow
crowd in a seminar room upstairs from his Fisher Hall office. The
subject is recession-racked Japan and its so-called (thanks to
Krugman) ``liquidity trap,'' a condition brought on, he explains,
by the country's banking system having too much savings and not
enough demand for capital investment. As outlined by Krugman, the
result is interest rates hovering at zero and persistent economic
stagnation.
</P>
<P>
   Calling it a ``credibility problem'' for Japan, Krugman admits
he failed to take the crisis seriously before, an admission his
detractors would no doubt cheer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for me to see what I got wrong,'' he tells an
audience of grad students. His advice to Japanese policy makers?
``Throw everything plus the rice cooker at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Illustrating the talk are many equations that surely make more
sense to PhD candidates in economics than to visiting reporters.
Times readers will soon make their own assessment of Krugman's
handiwork. Told by one visitor that he had ``learned something''
during the lecture, though, Krugman looks skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah?'' he says. ``And what would that be?''

THE APPLE OF HIS EYE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a dubious Christmas tradition _ the holiday letter, sent in
lieu of a Christmas card. Six laser-printed pages, telling you far
more than you ever wanted to know about the spouse, the kids, the
dog, the goldfish.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it could be worse. It could be the holiday video, a
montage of soccer games and backyard barbecues, all sent to you on
a CD-ROM. If it comes to this, Apple Computer Inc. will bear much
of the blame. Its new iMac DV computers and iMovie video editing
software could do for home video what the original Macintosh did
for desktop publishing.
</P>
<P>
   All Apple wanted was to build on the success of the iMac line,
and to judge by the $1,499 iMac DV Special Edition, they've done a
splendid job of it.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it's gorgeous. Apple designers put away their
crayons and wrapped their elite iMac in gleaming gray plastic. Like
all the iMacs, it catches the eye, but this time the impression is
one of restrained, mature elegance, like a Porsche in a room full
of pony cars.
</P>
<P>
   And like a Porsche, there's real horsepower inside. You get a
400-megahertz PowerPC processor; better yet, Apple is finally
selling an iMac with more than enough memory _ 128 megabytes under
the hood.
</P>
<P>
   If you want still more memory, you needn't perform major surgery
to upgrade, as with the original iMac. The new design features a
plastic door in the bottom of the machine that you can unlock with
a coin. There you can install up to 512 megs of memory or add an
AirPort wireless networking card so you can transmit data to other
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Apple has dispensed with the door that once concealed the iMac's
various data ports. Maybe the designers wanted to show off the new
goodies, like a badly needed reset button, so you can do emergency
reboots without unplugging the power cord. And there are two
FireWire ports, each allowing data transfers of up to 400 million
bits per second. Need a bigger hard drive? Buy an external FireWire
drive, and simply plug it in.
</P>
<P>
   The early iMac featured awful speakers, no doubt cadged from a
hidden stockpile of 1960s transistor radios. This time out, Apple
hired Harmon-Kardon to design speakers tailored especially for the
iMac. The result, while still not an audiophile's dream, is
surprisingly good. And it gets even better with an optional
Harmon-Kardon subwoofer that's so prettily done up in transparent
plastic that you'd hate to put it under the table, where a
subwoofer belongs.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's gotten rid of the rather flimsy tray-loaded CD-ROM drive
of the first iMac, replacing it with a DVD drive that you load by
sliding the disk directly into a slot. To show off the DVD, the
iMac comes with a copy of A Bug's Life, the film produced by Apple
CEO Steve Jobs's other company, Pixar.
</P>
<P>
   But it's more fun to create your own movies, with a digital
video camera and Apple's iMovie editing software. With a Sony
digital camcorder, I headed off to church and to a local shopping
mall and began getting in touch with my inner Kubrick.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a rough-hewn epic, cleverly titled You Better Go
To Church! It's got toe-tapping music from a gospel choir, comic
relief by a band of giggling children, even a dose of lust as the
camera scans a lascivious display of chocolates at a local candy
store.
</P>
<P>
   I shot about 16 minutes of tape, then plugged the camera into
the iMac's FireWire port and dumped the images onto the hard drive.
This small amount of video ate up nearly four gigabytes of
hard-drive space; a serious filmmaker would need to buy external
storage to supplement the 13-gigabyte iMac drive.
</P>
<P>
   Then I put iMovie to work. This software lets you drag and drop
video segments as if they were paragraphs in a document. It creates
animated titles, as well as fancy video effects like the big boys
use _ fade-ins, dissolves, and the like. The software is
deliciously simple. I had to consult the onscreen help file only
once, and figured out the rest without glancing at a manual.
</P>
<P>
   Computer video editing isn't new, but the iMac DV with iMovie
sets a new standard of low cost and ease of use. Even the threat of
video Christmas cards can't sour me on this new iMac. It's Apple's
best product in years.

SURRENDER OF GOLAN WOULD BE A RECKLESS GAMBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alois Brunner, who sent as many as 150,000 Jews to their deaths
during the Holocaust, is the most notorious Nazi war criminal still
at large. As Adolf Eichmann's deputy, Brunner supervised the
liquidation of Jewish communities in Austria, Germany, Greece, and
Slovakia. For 14 months he was commandant of the notorious
concentration camp in Drancy, France, whence more than 23,000 Jews
were sent to the death camps. One notorious entry on his resume is
the roundup of 340 Jewish orphans in Paris in July 1944. They were
sent by cattle car to Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   French courts have twice convicted Brunner in absentia and
sentenced him to death. This month a French judge cleared the way
for a third trial in absentia. Four other countries _ Germany,
Austria, Slovakia, and Poland _ have issued warrants for Brunner's
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   But all of these convictions and warrants are unavailing, for
Brunner has the protection of a powerful patron: Hafez al-Assad,
the dictator of Syria. As the Telegraph, a British newspaper,
reported recently, Brunner ``has been given sanctuary in Damascus
for decades, during which time he has helped to train Syria's
secret police in the use of torture.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the Syria that is ready for peace with Israel?
</P>
<P>
   Yet to hear the Israeli prime minister, an Israeli-Syrian treaty
is all but signed. ``It is possible to complete negotiations with
Syria in very little time,'' Ehud Barak said to his Cabinet last
week, ``perhaps in a few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The 18,000 Israelis who live in the Golan _ the strategic
plateau Israel seized from Syria in self-defense during the 1967
war _ have been told to start packing. Barak: ``I can't tell you an
agreement will be reached without a high price. The price will be
one our generation will pay on behalf of future generations.'' One
Israeli paper quoted an even blunter government minister: ``It is
all done; they have to start moving out.''
</P>
<P>
   All done? The New York Times seemed to think so too. ``The
Israelis and Syrians appear eager to resolve their differences
quickly,'' it editorialized on the day the peace talks began in
Washington. In its news columns, the Times assured readers that
Farouk al-Shara'a, Syria's belligerent foreign minister, could be
``expected to present a gentler face than in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Shara'a had other ideas. At the White House ceremony opening the
negotiations, Shara'a delivered a bitter diatribe that blamed
Israeli ``occupation'' for 50 years of Arab enmity, invented half a
million mythical Syrian refugees from the Golan, and insisted that
unless Israel surrenders every square inch of land ``to their
original owners,'' the Arabs would pursue a permanent ``conflict of
existence in which bloodshed can never stop.'' On the other hand,
if Israel yields to Syrian demands, it will be rewarded. With full
diplomatic relations? Open borders? Two-way tourism? An end to
anti-Israel terrorism?
</P>
<P>
   No. ``For Israel,'' Shara'a said, ``peace will mean the end of
the psychological fear which the Israelis have been living in as a
result of the existence of occupation.'' Giving up the Golan, in
short, will be its own reward.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing for Israelis to dream of peace. It is something
rather different to act as though the difference between dreams and
reality has been effaced.
</P>
<P>
   Syria is ruled by a cruel dictator-for-life who presides over
one of the world's most repressive regimes. To cement his grip on
power he has scrupled at nothing, including the massacre of tens of
thousands of his own citizens. Syria is on the State Department's
list of drug-exporting countries and its list of states that
sponsor terrorism. Any deal that would strengthen such a regime _
and it is understood that in exchange for signing a pact with
Israel, Syria would get not only the Golan but billions of dollars
in US aid _ would be a reckless gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Like most dictatorships, Syria breaks its word. Since seizing
power in 1970, Assad has broken agreement after agreement, as
Turkey, Lebanon, and the United States can attest. It is folly to
imagine that he would respect an accord with Israel. Once he has
the Golan, his interest in complying with the rest of the treaty
will evaporate. What will Israel do when Assad takes the land but
doesn't deliver the peace? Re-invade?
</P>
<P>
   Hatred of Jews and the Jewish state is fundamental to Assad's
system. The nation's longtime defense minister, Mustafa Tlas, is
the author of ``The Matza of Zion,'' a book promoting the medieval
libel that Jews murder gentiles and consume their blood on
Passover. Syrian citizens are fed a steady diet of anti-Israel
invective. To believe that such a government has peace with Israel
on its agenda is delusional.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian-Israeli frontier is quiet, and has been for 26 years.
Not coincidentally, Israeli artillery can reach Damascus from the
Golan. The surest way to preserve the de facto peace that already
exists is to maintain that deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   The day will come when Syria will be genuinely ready for peace.
Then talk of treaties and territorial givebacks will make sense. We
will know that day has arrived when Assad, like Anwar Sadat,
journeys to Jerusalem and holds out his hand in friendship. When
Syria shuts down the bloody terror groups that train on its soil.
And when Nazi butchers no longer find sanctuary in Damascus.

ANOTHER EDITOR SEEKS TO RENEW THE NEW REPUBLIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter Beinart is not only trying to revive the fading fortunes
of The New Republic, where the primary story in recent years has
been the messy editor exodus. He's trying to prove he's the right
man for one of journalism's real high-wire acts.
</P>
<P>
   Beinart _ a five-year New Republic staffer who became editor of
the 85-year-old opinion journal on Nov. 1 _ has a tough sell with
the skeptics. The New York Observer snidely announced his ascension
by characterizing him as ``a self-effacing 28-year-old former
intern.'' And the media world is watching, waiting to see if he can
give the 92,000-circulation magazine a coherent identity, forge a
workable relationship with owner Marty Peretz, and avoid the fate
of his recent predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that his task is daunting. The good news is that
everyone is rooting for him. ``God knows the magazine needs a
period of stability and success,'' says new Atlantic Monthly editor
Michael Kelly, who was fired by Peretz in 1997 after a turbulent
nine months as editor. ``And Peter Beinart is a very good bet to
provide it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his odds of success, Beinart _ a Cambridge, Mass.
native and Buckingham, Browne &AMP; Nichols alum (his stepfather is
American Repertory Theatre artistic director and New Republic
contributor Robert Brustein) _ takes over a magazine in need of
repairs.
</P>
<P>
   One big problem has been the revolving door in the editor's
office. Andrew Sullivan departed in 1996 with Peretz grumbling that
he had softened the magazine with ``uncontextualized froth.''
Kelly, a vocal Clinton critic, left after clashing with his boss
over the magazine's treatment of Peretz favorite Al Gore. In
September, Chuck Lane resigned suddenly after apparently getting
wind that his days were numbered.
</P>
<P>
   This turnover has occurred in the larger context of a gradual
brain drain. A decade ago, The New Republic featured an all-star
lineup of people like Hendrik Hertzberg, Fred Barnes, Sidney
Blumenthal, Michael Kinsley, Robert Kuttner, and Morton Kondracke _
one that hasn't since been replicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some degree, it was serendipity,'' says Beinart. ``It was a
remarkable collection of people. . . . Part of it was the time.''
Ronald Reagan's presidency may have marked The New Republic's last
great burst of energy, when the once liberal magazine tacked to the
center and in Beinart's words, was ``ruthless about taking people
on in our own camp.'' (A landmark was the 1986 editorial ``The Case
for the Contras'').
</P>
<P>
   Peretz, who simply responds ``yeah'' when asked if his magazine
has lost some altitude, says that ``politics has not focused on big
ideas, and Bill Clinton's presidency was in a certain sense . . . a
great titillating diversion.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor working against The New Republic is the
proliferation of faster, newer media like cable news networks and
the Internet. ``They can jump on the news cycle. And the weekly
opinion magazines are just struggling to get a voice in the
wilderness,'' says Hotline newsletter editor Craig Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   But Beinart, likeable, bright, and mildly hyper, has a
three-point plan of attack. First ``it's a magazine that's out
there to take risks . . . willing to take on sacred cows,'' he
says. Exhibit A: a clever Dec. 20 cover package called ``Why
America Loves Stupid Candidates,'' featuring George W. Bush in a
dunce cap and a piece by Andrew Sullivan comparing him to another
party boy pol, John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second thing is the magazine has to be a lot more on the
news,'' he adds. ``The stuff has to be ruthlessly reported.'' So
Beinart dispatched a reporter to Decatur, Ill. to write a Dec. 6
story on the racial wounds opened by the expulsion of six black
students after a football game brawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing is the magazine really has to have a sense of
fun,'' continues Beinart. A Jan. 3 parody issue devoted to the
millennium doesn't quite hit the mark. But an upcoming satirical
presidential campaign feature written by Doug McGrath called ``Dear
Village'' holds promise.
</P>
<P>
   One subject Beinart is no doubt tired of discussing is Al Gore.
Given Peretz's well-known fondness for the vice president, the
issue isn't so much about the magazine's politics as it is about
the editor's independence. The matter reared its head in October,
when The Washington Post reported that Beinart killed a piece on
Bill Bradley by Salon.com Washington correspondent Jake Tapper.
``Maybe it didn't fit in with their agenda,'' Tapper told the Post.
``Clearly, a fair and unbiased analysis of Bill Bradley's Senate
career . . . does not belong in Peter Beinart's New Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception (of favoritism toward Gore) has been a
problem,'' responds Beinart, who says that anyone who reads The New
Republic under his watch ``would not see the magazine as shilling
for anybody and I've gotten no pressure to shill for anybody.''
Arguing his case, he cites a Dec. 20 Notebook item critical of
Gore's pandering and a Dec. 13 story essentially lauding Bradley's
health care proposal over Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that we're going to endorse Al Gore in the
primary,'' he insists, perhaps bravely. ``That's very much up in
the air.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his challenges, Beinart's biggest asset is a substantial
reservoir of good will. Kelly, his ex-colleague at The New
Republic, calls him ``first rate in every way.'' Says Peretz, who's
known to change his mind on editors: ``I have such an exhilarated
feeling about Peter. . . . He's going to restore, I hope, (the
magazine's) primacy in big political and historical ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Tapper, who's waiting to be paid for his aborted Bradley
piece, wishes Beinart well. ``Quite frankly, I hope he turns The
New Republic around,'' he says. ``Just send me my kill fee.''

IBM THINKPAD HURT BY SALES STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKEL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
IBM's ThinkPad 240 
$1700 From Microwarehouse, www.warehouse.com 
800-397-8508 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the past year I have reviewed three ultralight laptops: the
Sony VAIO 505 ($1,600), the Acer TravelMate 332T ($2,000), and the
Sharp Actius PC-A250 ($2,150). Imagine my surprise when I
discovered IBM's stealth entry into this field, the ThinkPad 240.
</P>
<P>
   Priced at $1,700, this 2.9-pound laptop's specs are similar to
the competition's: it has a 366Mhz Celeron processor, 64 megabytes
of RAM (expandable to 192 megabytes), a 10.4-inch screen, 6.4
gigabyte hard drive, built-in modem, and a single Type II PCMCIA
card. With the standard 90-minute battery, the laptop is just 1
inch thick; with the optional high-capacity battery you get 3 hours
of computing time and a bulge on the bottom of the computer that
nicely slopes the keyboard. An external floppy disk drive is
standard, but the CD-ROM is optional.
</P>
<P>
   Where the ThinkPad 240 stands out is its keyboard. Although it's
nearly the same size as Sony's, and smaller than Acer's and
Sharp's, it is remarkably comfortable to use. I recently had to
write something in a hurry, and ended up typing on the keyboard for
days on end without undue stress. Another important difference is
the pointing device: although the other ultralights have a
touch-pad, the 240 uses IBM's TrakPoint, a tiny stick nestled
between the G, H and B keys. Another significant difference is the
case: instead of brushed magnesium, the 240's case is carbon fiber,
which looks better than a metal case and doesn't scuff or scratch
as easily.
</P>
<P>
   Like other ThinkPads, the 240 comes with Norton Anti-Virus,
RingCentral's combination fax/voicemail package, and a full copy of
Lotus Smart Suite (including Lotus Word Pro, Lotus Freelance
Graphics, Lotus Organizer, Lotus Approach, and Lotus Fast Site).
The hard drive comes split into two partitions, a C: drive and a D:
drive. This is bound to be confusing to some users, although it's
handy if you want to run Windows 98 and either NT or Linux.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the other ultralights, using the 240 at the office can be
a bit tricky. That's because there isn't a separate interface for
the CD-ROM: you need to use the PCMCIA slot, which means that you
can't use both the CD-ROM and a PCMCIA Ethernet card at the same
time. One way around this is to use a USB Ethernet adapter; another
option is to use a parallel port CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest problem with the 240 is IBM's sales strategy.
Designed solely for the business market, the 240 can be purchased
over the Web from stores like Warehouse.com but it can't be
purchased in retail stores. This isn't a problem for service, as
IBM offers a one-year limited warranty with a door-to-door courier
repair service, but it is a problem for people who like to bang on
the keys before they plunk down nearly $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Overall I like the 240. It does a much better job with
suspend/resume than any of the other ultralight laptops I've tried.
It has a very readable screen and a great keyboard. What's more,
ThinkPads have an excellent reputation for durability. I just wish
that IBM would sell it in the stores.

STAMP OUT THE POSTAL BLUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMPSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In this age of Internet e-mail and faxes, at least two companies
are jumping into the paper-and-glue world of postage meters. Both
Stamps.com (www.stamps.com/) and E-Stamp (www.estamp.com/) have
services that let you turn your personal computer into a postage
meter.
</P>
<P>
   A PC-based postage meter might not be exciting for a lot of
people, but it is for me. Years ago, I was a big user of the Postal
Service's flat-rate ``priority mail'' envelopes. They promised
two-day service to most parts of the United States. I could use
them to send somebody a book or a manuscript, and I could drop them
into a corner mailbox.
</P>
<P>
   Then, TWA Flight 800 blew up over Long Island Sound. While the
FBI was still in the throes of its investigation, the Post Office
put little red-and-white stickers on its mailboxes, saying that
stamped mail weighing more than a pound would no longer be
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   The regulation was designed to make it harder for a terrorist to
send a bomb through the mail. But the rule has also been a
tremendous inconvenience for me and many other people I know: We
don't want to send bombs, but we don't want to stand in line at the
Post Office, either. And we don't want to spend $25 a month to rent
a postage meter.
</P>
<P>
   But lowering the cost of postage meters is just one of the
advantages of the Post Office's new PC Postage program, which makes
it possible for both E-Stamp Corp., of San Mateo, Calif., and
Stamps.com Inc., of Santa Monica, Calif., to do business.
</P>
<P>
   Each company's software program lets you buy postage over the
Internet with your credit card and download the postage. The
postage stamp is printed as a bar code. As long as you have a
decent credit rating, you'll never be at a loss for stamps.
</P>
<P>
   The software also double-checks your destination address against
the Post Office's master list. It determines the correct ZIP code
and prints the bar code over the address _ all of which are likely
to speed delivery, especially during the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   Using either system is pretty simple. You start a program on
your Windows-based PC, type in the address, tell the computer how
much your letter or parcel weighs, and press the ``print'' button.
</P>
<P>
   If you are posting an envelope, you can run it straight through
your inkjet or laser printer: The envelope comes out with the
destination and return addresses, plus the postage.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to send something bigger, such as a priority mail
envelope, you can print the postage onto a mailing label, then
stick the label on the package.
</P>
<P>
   The key difference between Stamps.com and E-Stamp is how each
handles money, or rather, the prepaid postage.
</P>
<P>
   They can't simply keep your account on your computer's hard
disk. If they did, you could simply copy the postage account files
on a floppy disk, print $1,000 worth of postage, and restore the
files to your computer _ effectively restoring your electronic
wallet in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of storing prepaid postage on your computer, Stamps.com
keeps track of how much postage you have purchased on the company's
Internet servers. As a result, in order to print the postage stamp
(called an indicia), you need to be connected to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a problem for people with cable modems, DSL
connections, or for most wired businesses. In these environments,
computers are constantly connected to the Internet. You just run
the program, enter your password, and you're ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   Stamps.com also integrates with Microsoft Word and Outlook, as
well as with Word Perfect and Word Pro. This lets you print postage
without leaving the word processor.
</P>
<P>
   E-Stamp, on the other hand, is designed for people who aren't
constantly connected to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The program comes with a device known as a digital vault, which
attaches to your PC's parallel port and holds the postage.
</P>
<P>
   The vault lets you print without being connected to the
Internet, but it also means that you can print postage only from a
specific computer. Besides integrating with Word and Outlook,
E-Stamp can handle Microsoft ACT! and QuickBooks.
</P>
<P>
   Another important difference is price.
</P>
<P>
   Stamps.com charges a 10 percent monthly fee, with a minimum of
$1.99 and a maximum of $19.99. The company is running a special
deal for new subscribers: Sign up and get $25 in postage free.
</P>
<P>
   E-Stamp has no monthly fee, but makes you purchase the vault for
$49.99.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies sell a digital scale that you can connect to your
computer. The Stamps.com scale costs $49.99; the E-Stamp scale,
$79.95. E-Stamp can also print postage on a Dymo LabelWriter, which
the company will sell you for $209.95.
</P>
<P>
   I have been using Stamps.com for a few weeks. Since I was
already printing my envelopes, it was convenient to be able to
print the postage, too.
</P>
<P>
   But the big time savings for me, at least, was being able to
drop 2-pound packages into a mailbox without having to take them to
a Post Office. Now, with e-postage that's possible again because
the account holder's identification numbers allay fears he will
drop a bomb in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, I wonder just how useful these systems will
be for most Americans. After all, I would never use either to send
holiday cards: Bar codes are simply too impersonal. It's far
preferable, I believe, to get a roll of attractive self-adhesive
stamps from the Post Office and paste them in place.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the pervasiveness of e-mail means that I'm sending
far fewer business letters and invoices than in years past. And I
rarely send checks anymore: Instead, I use Quicken to send
electronic payments.
</P>
<P>
   The real use of these programs will be by businesses _
especially those that send out invoices or brochures. That will
give E-Stamp the edge, since it will have direct integration with
the new version of the QuickBooks accounting software that is
scheduled to be shipped early next year.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    I'm always a bit cranky the day after Christmas, when I promptly
take down those flattering white lights and toss the remaining
gingerbread limbs that would just go stale anyway.
 &HT;    I might try to cheer myself up with my ``Acoustic Christmas''
CD, but the Hooters' cover of ``Silent Night'' has no charm now
that the moment has passed. This morning-after dejection, I
realize, would be a common response to a favorite holiday's end _
except that I'm Jewish.
 &HT;    Yiddishe grandmother Jewish. Years-of-Hebrew-school Jewish.
Know-it-to-look-at-me Jewish.
 &HT;    My attachment to the holiday isn't one born of nostalgia, at
least not for an experience of my own. Growing up, we weren't the
kind of Jews who had a Christmas tree with a Star of David on top,
nor even a so-called Hanukkah bush.
 &HT;    My Hebrew-school teachers dismissed such seasonal trappings as
``goyishe narrishkeit'' (though my parents promised that if I
really wanted a tree, I could have one in March). For their
generation, Christmas was yet another locus of exclusion, a party
to which they had not been invited.
 &HT;    And Hanukkah made a poor substitute, a minor event in the annual
calendar _ not even a High Holy Day _ dressed up and retrofitted to
satisfy third-generation children.
 &HT;    What's more, we all knew it. Smirking my way through Hanukkah
circa 1982 may well have been My First Ironic Experience. By the
fourth night of candle-lighting, I was itching to get back to the
``Benson'' rerun I was watching.
 &HT;    My appreciation for Christmas, on the other hand, developed
completely without irony. That affection, I should clarify, does
not include the holy stillness of midnight Mass or the simple
truths of Scripture _ I don't know from those, as my grandmother
would say.
 &HT;    I'm talking about the bells and whistles that differentiated the
holiday from Hanukkah: the hand-painted, faux-antique ornaments and
rooftop reindeer and mail-order gourmet fruitcakes. Precisely the
sorts of things that serious Christians sometimes deplore as
crassly commercial, a tacky, insipid betrayal of the holiday's true
meaning.
 &HT;    But that's their issue, not mine. It's hard to worry about
maintaining the purity of a holiday that isn't really yours to
begin with. And much easier to enjoy its light side when you don't
have to deal with tough questions of faith or responsibility, or
with all those magical-realist plot lines.
 &HT;    And so, not normally a booster for rampant materialism, I
forgive all in the season of giving and gaze at the windows of
F.A.O. Schwarz, cheeks rosy, eyes brimming. I make an annual
pilgrimage to the tree at Rockefeller Center. I've actually crashed
groups of carolers. And I've barely forgiven my older brother for
quitting his high school gig as a mallside Santa because he was
allergic (weakling!) to the glue of the beard.
 &HT;    Furthermore, I'm not alone in my taste for tinsel. Even some of
my most jaded Jewish friends share my delight in the indulgent
excesses of Christmas treacle. I invite them over for eggnog. They
drag me out to see their favorite manger. I'm not proud to admit
this, but we have even watched the stop-action ``Rudolph'' special,
year after year after year. Can gift boxes of Russell Stover candy
be far off?
 &HT;    Indeed, American Jews in general have proved themselves such
eager Christmas enthusiasts that they've actually contributed a
startling number of the images that now define the holiday.
 &HT;    The pretty picture of fair-haired gamins in dressy tartans,
gathered about the hearth with their hunting dogs, is practically a
trademark of Ralph Lauren, ne Lifschitz. And of course it was a
Jew, Irving Berlin, who first wrote longingly of a white Christmas
_ just like the ones he used to know.
 &HT;    In recent years, it seems that Jews have started turning that
kitschy exuberance toward their own rituals. Whereas Hanukkah was a
fairly casual affair during my childhood, it's now a full-scale
production, with its own fetish objects _ hand-painted,
faux-antique Stars of David, Winnie the Pooh dreidels, mail-order
gourmet latkes, strings of foil stars with which to bedeck your
haimishe halls.
 &HT;    If my parents felt excluded from Christmas, and I embraced it, I
suspect my 2-year-old niece _ who spent those eight days listening
to a Hebrew Hanukkah music soundtrack, surrounded by a set of
sparkly menorah and candle decorations _ will grow up indifferent
to it.
 &HT;    For all my devotion to the spirit of another religion's holiday,
though, there's one line I've never crossed. I've never bought a
Christmas tree. As every kid knows, you can't celebrate Christmas
without one, and I don't.
 &HT;    Come Dec. 25, I fall on the side of tradition _ my own, that is
_ and spend the day doing laundry. I can comfortably visit the
holiday, take in the lovely sights and sounds, but I have no real
interest in laying claim to it or to its central symbol, and I
suspect I never will.
 &HT;    But if I did, I know just how I'd decorate it.

IN ISRAEL, RELUCTANT HOSTS TO PILGRIMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Imagine having to host a party that is not your own.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Rabbi Donniel Hartman, a prominent interfaith
scholar, describes the Jewish state's awkward position as it
prepares for millions of Christian visitors, including Pope John
Paul II, to celebrate 2000 years of Christianity in the land of its
birth.
</P>
<P>
   The uneasy position accounts for what Hartman calls a ``polite
silence'' in Israeli society on the eve of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of happening. But it's happening under the surface,
you don't sense any excitement,'' says Hartman, of the Shalom
Hartman Institute, where he is an Orthodox rabbi and avid proponent
of interfaith dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, allegations are flying from leaders of
Israel's own tourism industry that the Jewish state has failed to
prepare adequately for the millennium and may squander a valuable
opportunity for Israel graciously to host Christians from all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers say a unique opportunity for the coming holidays
to be an occasion for dialogue between the two faiths has been
largely reduced to a security threat. Secular Israeli police
officials are focused on fringe Christian sects filled with
apocalyptic fantasies that 2000 marks ``the end of days,'' as it is
referred to in the Book of Revelation.
</P>
<P>
   And in some corners of Israel, the throng of Christian visitors
and celebrations often stirs bitter memories of Christianity's long
history of persecuting Jews. To many ultra-Orthodox Jews, the
occasion is seen as an affront to Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   A recent article in the Haredi newspaper Yated Neeman said
Christians are preparing for ``a great crusade in our holy land.''
It emphasizes the ``profanity and apostasy of the Christians'' and
depicts them as ``enemies of Judaism from time immemorial.''
</P>
<P>
   It also calls on the Haredi, or ``God fearing,'' community to
refuse Christians apartment rentals or hotel rooms in Haredi
neighborhoods, advises readers ``to stop them from holding
processions and ceremonies in public places,'' and to ``bar them
from visiting our holy places.''
</P>
<P>
   But such Israeli references to ``our holy places'' and even
Hartman's notion of a party in ``our home'' deeply offends
Christian leaders, who counter that Christianity was born in the
land and that many Palestinian Christians who live in the Galilee,
West Bank, and Jerusalem can trace their roots to the earliest
followers of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   The West Bank town of Bethlehem, where Jesus was born and which
will be the focus of Christmas celebrations, is also under
Palestinian rule as a result of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Peter Vasco, director of the Holy Land Foundation and a
liaison between the US Embassy and the Franciscan Order, which
holds custody of some Christian holy sites, says, ``It is nice that
they think of it as an invitation to their home, but we like to
think of it as our home as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is Israel that is assuming the responsibility of the
influx of tourists at Ben Gurion International Airport and
coordinating the arrival of a host of world dignitaries and church
leaders to holy sites in Jerusalem, Nazareth, and the Galilee
region. And it is Israel that will shoulder the enormous burden of
security for the Holy Land's millennial visitors.
</P>
<P>
   So how does a country built on the ashes of the Holocaust and a
history of suffering under Christendom deal with such a
celebration?
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to host this event with the greatest respect,''
says Jerusalem's mayor, Ehud Olmert.
</P>
<P>
   Respect perhaps, but not necessarily a sense of festivity,
according to Jonathan Harpz, director of the Jerusalem Hotel
Association.
</P>
<P>
   He was quoted in Friday's Jerusalem Post as saying, ``Jerusalem
is filthy, simply disgusting. The city isn't lit and it doesn't
feel festive. . . . The city isn't decorated. And the mayor should
have made these things his priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Meron Benvenisti, former deputy mayor of Jerusalem, has been
publicly warning Israelis about what he sees as a lack of
generosity of spirit toward the coming Christian celebrations,
saying that ``Israelis are flinching at the idea of the Christian
attachment to the Holy Land.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi David Rosen, director of the Anti-Defamation League's
office in Israel, says the focus by Israeli authorities and news
media on the small fringe of apocalyptic Christians reveals an
ignorance about Christianity and of the vast majority who come here
as religious pilgrims or perhaps just tourists who wish to see the
land where their faith has its origins.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of focus on the fringe misses the great opportunity
we have here,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   As Hartman puts it, ``A lot of the silence that is taking place
is because we don't know how to take advantage of that
opprotunity.''
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup poll commissioned by the Chicago-based International
Fellowship of Christians and Jews revealed widespread ignorance
about Christianity in Israel. The poll of 479 Israelis, with a
margin of error of 4 percent, revealed that 75 percent could not
identify the date of Christmas. Some 65 percent do not have a
single Christian friend and only slightly fewer said they have
never been personally aquainted with a Christian.
</P>
<P>
   The ignorance reflected in the poll can be traced to the lack of
substantive education about Christianity in Israeli schools,
according to Ron Kronish, director of the Interreligious
Coordinating Council in Israel, a prominent Jerusalem-based
organization promoting interfaith dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Kronish, who presented a research paper last year to the Vatican
on the issue and has recently published its findings in Israel,
says: ``There is virtually no education about Christianity in
Israeli schools'' other than a very brief skimming of its history
in junior high grades. What little is taught about Christianity, he
says, leaves students with ``a very dark, medieval view of
Christianity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes up through the Crusades to the Holocaust, and then it
just stops without any discussion of changes in the last three
decades,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Kronish has recommended that Israeli schools adopt a special
curriculum in the coming year to learn more about Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an opportunity ahead of us,'' he says. ``And it
remains to be seen if we are going to take it more seriously. We
still have time.''

GORE, MRS. CLINTON DISTANCE THEMSELVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a ritzy hotel ballroom six months ago, Hillary
Rodham Clinton made it clear where she stands in the contest
between Al Gore and Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is my choice, and I hope your choice, for the next
president of the United States,'' she said about Gore at a
gathering of 400 Democratic women here.
</P>
<P>
   But, since she became a full-fledged candidate for the US Senate
from New York, the togetherness evident in their joint appearance
June 1 has become a thing of the past, at least for public
consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Though Clinton and Gore often travel the same well-worn New York
streets on the same day, house their local campaign staffs in the
same office building, and are two number twos trying to become
number ones, they might as well be on different planets.
</P>
<P>
   Their situation is emblematic of a campaign in which distancing
and dissing have become part of the national political conversation
and politics has trumped personal relationships. From Republican
front-runner George W. Bush putting daylight between himself and
the congressional Republicans who support him to Gore and Mrs.
Clinton distancing themselves from President Clinton and each
other, the 2000 race has become a contest of disassociation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about every person for themselves,'' Stephen Hess, a
senior fellow of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution,
said about this election year. ``This is quite cutthroat
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   And nowhere is that trend more evident than in New York, where
both Gore and Clinton are locked in very different but equally
competitive races: Gore against Bradley in the state's March 7
presidential primary, and Clinton against New York City Mayor
Rudolph Guiliani, her likely opponent in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   With statewide polls currently showing Gore running neck and
neck with Bradley and with Clinton trailing Guiliani, the plan to
team up the two candidates before the New York primary is in
abeyance.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides say the vice president values the first lady's
endorsement, but he has not decided how he wants to use it. Those
aides say Gore might ask her to campaign for him separately, but
any decision on appearing together before the primary, when it
could either help or hurt Gore, will have to wait until after New
Hampshire's Feb. 1 primary.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore wins in New Hampshire, Gore's advisers say, he will have
momentum heading into New York, a state that would then become less
crucial to his nomination. That would also make an appearance with
Clinton less risky politically.
</P>
<P>
   Those advisers and political analysts say that having the first
lady campaign for Gore in New York would only dredge up notions of
``Clinton fatigue'' after her husband's two terms in the White
House. It also risks damaging Gore's good relations with Jewish
voters who are upset with Clinton's handling of intemperate remarks
about Israel by Suha Arafat, the wife of Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, during Clinton's recent trip to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   An informal adviser to Gore summed up the campaign's thinking:
``Why stick your toe real deep in the water when you don't know if
it's going to be freezing, scalding, or tepid when you will know in
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Since June, Clinton has begun to soft-pedal her support for
Gore, even saying at one point that she likes both Bradley and
Gore. Her campaign insists she remains deeply loyal to Gore and
will do whatever it takes to help him win.
</P>
<P>
   Asked last month whether she wanted Gore to campaign for her,
Clinton gave a two-word reply: ``Absolutely, absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   But it may be wise for Clinton to hedge her bets against the
possibility that Bradley, a former senator from neighboring New
Jersey and a New York Knicks basketball star, wins not only the New
York primary but also the Democratic nomination. Come November, she
will have to hitch her wagon to the Democratic nominee, whoever it
is, and run a coordinated campaign in New York.
</P>
<P>
   There are other risks for her, as well. Analysts say that if
Clinton comes out too forcefully for Gore and he loses the New York
primary, she would be hounded about her lack of clout in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would be well advised not to overplay the Gore connection
right now, because the embarrassment would be greater if he lost
the primary in New York,'' said New York pollster Lee Miringhoff.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the distancing may serve the interests of both
campaigns. Gore is trying to break free from his association with
the president and to establish his own indentity. The first lady is
seeking to establish herself as a New Yorker and get outside the
shadow of national politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly Mrs. Clinton would like to help the vice president
in any way she can, but whether she can and whether he wants her to
is an open question,'' said New York Democratic consultant Norm
Adler. ``Mrs. Clinton has got to figure out how to help herself
before she worries about how to help Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Gore, Adler added: ``If he is viewing her as a walking
stick to help him down the path of victory, he is making one big
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   New York pollster John Zogby said that, in theory, Clinton would
derive the greatest benefit by having Bradley as the party's
nominee and leading the ticket in New York state. Analysts say
Bradley polls well among the state's independent voters, which
could give Clinton a boost in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore at the top of the ticket, I think, is only a reminder
of Clinton fatigue,'' Zogby said. ``They would be two Clinton
fatigue candidates kind of feeding off each other. Bradley affords
her the opportunity to remind voters of something higher and
different.''

NO SHYING AWAY FROM GOD TALK IN CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senator John McCain says he doesn't wear his
religion on his sleeve, but a stirring testimonial to his Christian
faith is on the air in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   In a radio ad titled ``A Christmas Story,'' retired Air Force
Col. Bud Day says he will never forget being deeply touched by the
sermon McCain, his cellmate, composed for the servicemen in a
Vietnamese prison camp on Christmas night, 1971. ``It certainly was
a shot to everyone's morale to hear those Christian words in that
very un-Christianlike place,'' Day recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Governor George W. Bush publicly attests that Jesus
``changed my heart.'' Vice President Al Gore proudly declares he is
a born-again Christian. Steve Forbes said on a TV news show last
Sunday that Jesus Christ is his savior. Senator Orrin Hatch, Gary
Bauer, and Alan Keyes profess that their faith in God is
fundamental to who they are and how they would lead the nation.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of political reasons why God Talk is so
prevalent in this presidential campaign. The candidates are trying
to show they are more virtuous than the man in the White House.
Tragedies like the murders at Columbine High School turn voters'
focus on the country's perceived moral weaknesses. Constituencies
of conservative Christians have clout in next month's Iowa caucuses
and upcoming primaries in the South.
</P>
<P>
   But the unusual intensity and passion of the Christian rhetoric
in this campaign _ which is disturbing to some, especially for its
sectarian edge _ very likely springs as much from the candidates'
personal journeys of faith as it does from raw political
calculation, people close to them say.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, Gore, and Bauer, all Southerners who attend evangelical
churches, tell soulful, personal stories of times of trouble or
doubt that led them to commit to Jesus Christ. Even McCain and
Senator Bill Bradley, the two candidates who say the subject is too
private to discuss in their campaigns, write in their memoirs of
profound encounters with religion and spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   The cruelty and godlessness of the Hanoi prison camp where he
was held for more than five years, McCain wrote in ``Faith of My
Fathers,'' could have shattered his faith. Instead, McCain said, he
embraced the words of the creed that another prisoner had scratched
into the cell wall: ``I believe in God, the Father Almighty.
</P>
<P>
   ``There, standing witness to God's presence in a remote,
concealed place, I felt God's love and care more vividly than I
would have felt it had I been safe among a pious congregation in
the most magnificent cathedral,'' McCain wrote. In prison, the
once-cocky Naval aviator said he ``prayed more often and fervently
than I ever had as a free man,'' and his most sacred Christmases
were spent with the ``gaunt, unshaven, dirty, and generally
wretched congregation'' of fellow POWs.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was raised an Episcopalian, is married to a
Congregationalist, and now belongs to a Baptist church in Phoenix.
``We don't go to church every week, we aren't as fervent as we
should be,'' said Cindy McCain, the Arizona senator's spouse. ``But
John is a man of great faith and inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, McCain's chief rival for the GOP nomination, has surprised
aides with his avowals of Christian faith. Ralph Reed, the former
executive director of the Christian Coalition and now an adviser to
the Texas governor, said he was ``taken aback'' when Bush, asked in
a televised debate in Iowa to name the philosopher or thinker who
most influenced him, answered, ``Christ, because he changed my
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so enthusiastic and expressive _ it was like somebody
had read out his lottery ticket,'' said Reed, insisting the answer
was sincere and heartfelt, and not political. ``Bush's faith
commitment is real, and it brought stability, meaning, and an
extraordinary change to his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush often relates how a walk and conversation with evangelist
Billy Graham at his parents' home in Kennebunkport, Maine, in 1985,
started him on a journey to renew his Christian faith, accept
Jesus, and turn around a life of too much partying and drinking. He
went back to Texas, joined a men's Bible study group, became active
in an evangelical Methodist church, began reading Scripture every
day, and turned to prayer and meditation. A few months later, he
swore off alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had always been a religious person, had regularly attended
church, even taught Sunday school, and served as an altar boy,''
Bush wrote in his memoir, ``A Charge to Keep.'' ``But that weekend
my faith took on new meaning. It was the beginning of a walk where
I would recommit my heart to Jesus Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who went to both Presbyterian and Episcopal churches as a
child, says his faith teaches him humility and how to be a good
husband and parent, and he prays for patience and understanding.
His political philosophy of ``compassionate conservatism'' is
rooted in his Christian values, Bush says, and his proposal to
provide federal aid and grants to churches and faith-based
charities and make them partners in solving social problems grows
out of what he, in the evangelical tradition, calls the
``transforming power of faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore has a lot in common with Bush: He is also a
proponent of creating partnerships between faith-based groups and
federal programs; he has what Reed says is the same uniquely
Southern trait of speaking with fluency and emotion about his
religion; and he, too, says he was born again in Jesus. In his
junior year at Harvard, Gore says, ``I felt a transformational
relationship with my own interpretation of God, and Christ in
God.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's evangelical journey started in the revival tents of
Tennessee. Unsettled by his service in Vietnam, Gore's next stop
was the liberal Vanderbilt Divinity School for a year of spiritual
searching. As adults, Gore and his wife, Tipper, were baptized in a
Southern Baptist church outside Washington. Later, his faith was
tested when his only sister died of lung cancer and his son,
Albert, was nearly killed in a car accident.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview on ``60 Minutes,'' Gore said he's not
embarrassed to talk of his Christian faith (in fact, he regularly
sprinkles his speeches with Biblical imagery, passages of
Scripture, and quotes from Mother Teresa), even when some
intellectuals disdain it. ``It's the core of my life,'' he said.
``It's the foundation of my other beliefs, my political
philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. K. Bruce Miller, pastor of Mt. Vernon Baptist Church,
where Gore worships, believes Gore's promises to aid the poor and
protect the environment are Bible-based. ``Psalm 24 _ `the earth is
the Lord's, and the fullness thereof' _ says we don't own this
place,'' Miller said. ``When Al Gore talks about stewardship, I
believe he is serious about trying to do God's will.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans Bauer, Forbes, Keyes, and Hatch make Christian
values central to their policy agendas, and the debate in Iowa
earlier this month illustrated it: Keyes, a Roman Catholic, said
that as a moral president, he would push school prayer and preserve
family farms. Forbes, an Episcopalian, endorsed vouchers to help
parents pay for parochial-school tuition, and he called for a
spiritual renewal in America. Bauer, who belongs to an evangelical
Bible church, wants students taught creationism and God-fearing
judges appointed to the federal bench. All of them, including
Hatch, a Mormon, say abortion violates God's law.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, when his main issue was the flat tax, candidate
Forbes didn't reveal much about his personal life, including his
Christian faith. Today, says the wealthy publisher and now-vocal
abortion opponent, it's essential information for voters trying to
gauge the depth, honesty, and morality of a future president.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was growing up, religion was an ever-present part of
our lives, low-key perhaps, but there on a daily basis,'' said
Forbes. ``I do believe that Jesus Christ is my Lord and savior. And
I believe God created the world.''
</P>
<P>
   His most prayerful times, Forbes recalls, were when his mother
was dying of lung cancer and two of his daughters were born
prematurely. What he prays for, Forbes said in a telephone call
from South Carolina, ``are private, kept between me and my God.''

</P>
<P>
   BANKS-VENTURE-CAPITAL (Undated) _ For venture capitalists, times
have never been richer. Now big banks want a piece of the action.
Since 1996, major commercial banks like Chase Manhattan have
tripled the money they devote to venture capital, the high-risk,
high-return world of financing startup companies. The appeal is
obvious. Chase and its kin are happy to get 8 percent interest on a
typical loan, while the average venture capital investment in a new
company almost doubled this year. And bank stocks have been weak
this year, while stocks in publicly traded venture capital
companies like CMGI have soared. But as banks move deeper into
venture capital, they face some risks of their own. A few banks,
notably Chase and Wells Fargo, have had successful venture arms for
years, but others have little experience with the hyper-competition
of Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-INDUSTRY (Frankfurt, Germany) _ The German government
says it plans to repeal taxes on capital gains from the sale of
industrial holdings inside the country, a move that could reshape
the country's corporate landscape. The large stakes in industrial
companies held by big banks and financial companies have helped
preserve ``fortress Germany'' at a time when the rest of Europe is
undergoing sweeping consolidation. German stocks surge more than 4
percent, led by Allianz, Deutsche Bank and other financial
companies. Allianz alone holds industrial stakes worth $30 billion,
while Deutsche Bank owns stakes worth about $25 billion. The
proposal, however, is vague on many details and in any case must be
approved by both houses of Germany's Parliament. By Edmund L.
Andrews.

industrial average was up 205 points to 11408, a record. The S&AMP;P
500 was up 23 points, and the Nasdaq composite index up 47 points.
Treasury prices were little changed. European markets were also

THIS LITTLE PIGGY ... WENT TO HARVARD? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some readers are charmed. Others rev up a mild huff. Most,
though, are just puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   David Mamet's latest work tells the story of a self-educated and
persistent pig named Henrietta who, after being rejected from a
certain esteemed law school in Cambridge, Mass., ultimately gains
entry, becomes valedictorian, goes on to the Supreme Court, and
speaks loftily about social justice and the disenfranchised
classes.
</P>
<P>
   Like one of Franz Kafka's parables, Mamet's ``Henrietta'' seems
to be a simple children's tale about defeating the odds. But the
31-page illustrated book is being snapped up in Cambridge book
stores and has provoked speculation at Harvard Law School about the
playwright and filmmaker, and about the author's deeper meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Some see the tale of the Shakespeare-savvy swine as a thinly
veiled jab at elitism. Others view the book as an attack on what
they perceive as Harvard's legacy of discriminating against
minorities. And some believe it's just a story about making it on
your own.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an anti-elitism lesson for kids,'' said Alan
Dershowitz, the outspoken Harvard Law School professor who added a
blurb on the jacket praising the fable's ``truth.'' ``No matter
what you are, no matter what people perceive you as, you can make
it to the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Hulings, a 24-year-old law student, gleaned a different
meaning: ``The moral to me is that finding value in what other
people hold in esteem is ultimately a shallow endeavor,'' referring
to the pig's lack of success before Harvard was affixed to her
resume.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the book's illustrator knows Mamet's meaning. Elizabeth
Dahlie, a Wellesley artist who jazzed up Henrietta with a red
ribbon on her squiggle of a tail, glasses perched low on the sow's
snout, and a crimson-striped muffler to help her brave the cold,
said: ``Really, I'm not sure. I just drew the pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   Mamet did not clear up the confusion. He declined an interview
through his agent in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But if the book is chiding Harvard Law School for the period in
its history when it excluded almost everyone except white males,
officials at the nation's oldest law school are quick to come to
its defense.
</P>
<P>
   About 47 percent of the students in the class that entered this
fall are women and more than 25 percent are minorities, said Mike
Chmura, a Harvard spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look for people who provide some difference, who have made
good use of their opportunities, who have overcome disadvantage _
just like Henrietta,'' said Joyce Curll, the law school's
admissions director. ``We have probably the most diverse law
school. If Mr. Mamet really looked around at this institution, he
would see that.''
</P>
<P>
   While the student population has grown more diverse in the past
decade, the law school's faculty has been slow to change. Of 79
professors, only 13 are women and eight are minorities, Chmura
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mamet, known for his black-humor plays including the Pulitzer
Prize-winning ``Glengarry Glen Ross'' and provocative movies such
as ``Wag the Dog'' and ``The Spanish Prisoner,'' named his heroine
after a pig once owned by his friend, the wealthy Boston developer
and presidential host on Martha's Vineyard, Dick Friedman. The
developer named the restaurant in his Charles Hotel in Cambridge
Henrietta's Table, after his departed sow.
</P>
<P>
   And while Mamet never comes out and calls the ``Great
University'' by name, illustrations clearly depict Cambridge's
Charles Square and the Weeks Memorial Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The story starts with the learned pig leaving her solitude and
studies on some ``Eastern Isle'' to follow her dream of addressing
juries. ``Having seen the barriers to the Professions crumble
before now this and that disadvantaged group,'' Mamet writes, ``she
presented herself at the institution of her choice.''
</P>
<P>
   But without credentials or an undergraduate degree, the law
school rejects her. Later, after ``she haunted the libraries and
folded herself into the backs of the lecture halls,'' the school
banned her. Dahlie, the illustrator, paints a sign hanging from a
door: ``No pigs.''
</P>
<P>
   After living like a bum in the streets of Cambridge, things
change for the better for Henrietta. She meets the ``Old
Vagabond,'' who turns out to be the Great University's president.
But the president misplaces his glasses and doesn't realize she's a
pig. He's so impressed with her knowledge of Hamlet, Oedipus, and
Henry Fielding, that, even after he discovers she's a pig, he
invites her to attend the law school.
</P>
<P>
   Henrietta marches onward from there. And so have sales of
Mamet's book.
</P>
<P>
   But while many may be reading it, they are often left shrugging
quizzically.
</P>
<P>
   Leaning over his thick textbooks and cramming for his final at
the Harvard Law School's imposing library earlier this week, a
25-year-old law student shook his head after reading ``Henrietta''
several times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's driving at something,'' Jake Erhard said. ``But
I'm not quite sure what it is.''

UNLIKELY ODYSSEY OF `I KISS YOU' CELEBRITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, Mahir Cagri was just an unwitting Web
celebrity, a regular guy who woke up one morning to discover he had
been transformed into an international cult figure. He was
impossible to contact, a mysterious figure, an image without a
voice. But after weeks of ignoring my pleas (written in fractured
Turk-glish), he finally called the other day to tell his version of
the story. And guess what? Now that he is a close personal friend,
I can tell you that Mahir Cagri is famous for all the wrong
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like sex, but that is not something I would tell the whole
world,'' he says. ``I would rather ask the world to think about the
children who are dying of hunger. We need to share.''
</P>
<P>
   For the uninitiated, Cagri is the Turkish fellow whose earnest
home page _ ``I kiss you!!!!'' _ was stolen by a hacker who spiced
up the Web page with such comments as ``I like sex.'' The doctored
page was transmitted all over the world, and jokesters posted
dozens of parody sites, featuring animated songs, games, and films
showing Cagri in compromising positions. Folks had a great time
chuckling at Cagri's English, noting his affection for ``music
enstrumans'' and his desire to ``invitate peoples'' to visit him in
Izmir. Some entrepreneurs even sold his image on coffee mugs and
T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me happy if they are having fun and getting away from
their problems,'' Cagri says of his new fans and ``friends.'' He
adds that he has even forgiven the hacker. He also has no interest
in going after journalists who have misrepresented him, including a
British writer who claimed that Cagri was demanding $50,000 to do
an interview with CNN. (Not true.) ``I don't have time to run after
those articles,'' he says through a translator during a telephone
interview from New York. ``I have other things to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Cagri is on a US media tour sponsored by a Web
company called eTour.com, a free member-based guide to the
Internet. The company brought Cagri over as the guest of honor at
its recent publicity party. ``Here you have a guy whose whole world
has been turned upside down, and he's really Mr. Cool,'' says Jim
Lanzone, eTour's vice president of marketing. ``He wants to visit
every single person who wrote to him. He keeps saying, `I must go
to Buffalo. I must go to Tacoma.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Cagri received offers from many US firms, but he says that eTour
extended the ``warmest of invitations.'' He says a film company,
which he will not name, traveled to Turkey and offered him $25,000
to shoot a film about his life. ``When they first came over, they
thought we didn't know anything about the world, and they were
shocked when they met us,'' he recalls. ``In five days, they were
up to $250,000, but I did not accept because I don't like those
people. Money is not everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Cagri realizes that folks are eager to capitalize on his image
as some rube who _ perish the thought! _ can't speak the Queen's
English. ``They are the ones who don't know the world,'' he says.
``They are the ones who are living in their own tower. They are the
ones who have lost love. I am Turkish. Why do I have to speak
English? They can't say a word in Turkish, but I can say what I
need in English.''
</P>
<P>
   He says if he makes any money out of this Kafkaesque brush with
fame, he wants to use it to build a school for children from
war-torn areas. He has already convinced one West Coast
entrepreneur selling ``I kiss you!!!'' merchandise to donate the
proceeds to a nonprofit organization that supports refugees in the
Caucasus. ``It wasn't a considerable amount, but he did give me
some money,'' Cagri says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a rich man,'' he continues. ``I am a regular man. But
I would like to find a lawyer soon to stop those people from doing
what they are doing. Everybody that uses me in a bad way, I am
against them.''
</P>
<P>
   Fun is fine, but Cagri would appreciate it if his fans would
help him save the world. ``I think I can use this in a positive way
if I can get help from people like you who are journalists,'' he
says. ``I am thinking of setting up the Mahir Friendship, Love, and
Peace Fan Club. Of course, it will be fun, but we will work on
world problems as well.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, he's off to visit his new best friends on his whirlwind
tour. He's terribly sorry that he can't invite every one of them to
stay at his house, but it seems he does have time to entertain
certain members of the Fourth Estate. ``I invite you,'' he says,
before racing off to the next interview. And my husband? ``Yes. I
invite him. You can come.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Recently, I spent some quality time watching ``The Donny and
Marie Show'' at work. A celebrity dentist was revealing toothsome
secrets. Riveting, it wasn't. But it was the only thing I could get
on my desktop computer.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. A Canadian company called ICraveTV.com is
rebroadcasting programming from 17 television stations in Canada
and the United States live on the Internet. The broadcast quality
is awful, but the very fact that this upstart company is doing this
has TV stations and the National Football League up in arms. The
company is testing the limits of laws about broadcasting
programming on line and has already received cease and desist
demands from the NFL and a consortium of local stations in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is imperative that this illegal behavior be nipped in the
bud,'' says Tom Davidson, the counsel for WKBW-TV in Buffalo who is
working with a group of broadcasters. According to US law, only
cable and satellite companies may retransmit copyrighted
programming provided that they pay royalties into a pool that is
redistributed to the original programmers. ``Web site operators
don't qualify under US law, and Canada has a similar law,'' says
Davidson.
</P>
<P>
   But William Craig, president and founder of ICraveTV, claims
that it is legal to retransmit programming over the Internet in
Canada. The Web site asks users to enter a Canadian area code
before receiving access to the programs. Anyone can simply look up
a number in the phone book and gain instant access to such fare as
``Donny and Marie.'' ``You could also go down to the store and
steal a shirt, but does that mean those stores shouldn't be selling
shirts?'' says Craig. ``In a free marketplace, you have to rely on
people not committing fraud.'' Craig is selling ads on the site;
the more folks who view the site _ from New Brunswick, Canada, or
New Brunswick, N.J. _ the more money he makes.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, the case raises intriguing questions about what can
be broadcast on line, and it's not going away. Both Davidson and an
NFL spokesperson say they plan to take further legal action soon.
Stay tuned _ but not on ICraveTV.com. That would be fraud.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   And for those who have way too much time on their hands, the
latest Net craze is a little game called Elf Bowling. The
dreamchild of a Dallas company called NVision Design, the game
features Santa's helpers, who get sick of working for the Clauses
and go on strike. Santa retaliates by turning them into pins in a
bowling game. It's dumb, but it's hilarious.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it seems that there's an urban legend surrounding the game.
A message is circulating via e-mail warning that the game is
infected with a delayed virus that will be activated Dec. 25. Not
true, says Dan Ferguson, president of NVision Design. ``There is a
virus scare every two weeks, but this is only a hoax,'' he says.
The Symantec Virus Research Center, in fact, has issued an alert
that the rumors are false; Elf Bowling is clean. You can download
it from NVisiondesign.com. But think of the poor squeaking elves
during this holiday season: After all, elves are people, too.

   INTERNATIONAL-STYLE (New York) _ The Met Life (formerly Pan Am)
Building at the foot of Park Avenue is one of the worst disasters
ever to befall the New York cityscape. All New Yorkers acknowledge
the universal truth of this belief. But Kivi Sotamaa, a young
Finnish architect, likes the building very much. Most startling of
all, Satamaa appreciates the closure that the building brings to
the southern end of Park Avenue, and to the grand boulevard of
International Style office towers leading toward it. To him, and to
a surprising number of other architects and city-lovers, the
so-called Park Avenue Corridor is the architectural heart of the
20th century. The corridor is the crystallization of the New York
myth, the soaring city of work and ambition, where the sky is the
limit and dreams are fulfilled. It symbolizes New York's
displacement of Paris as the century's most vibrant City of Light.

HALLINAN DECLARED WINNER IN SAN FRANCISCO RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RYAN KIM and PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ District Attorney Terence Hallinan, holding a
slim lead over challenger Bill Fazio with less than a thousand
votes left to process from the Dec. 14 run-off election, was
declared the winner Wednesday night in a race that had been too
close to call since polls closed.
</P>
<P>
   Fazio conceded defeat, marking the third close election loss to
Hallinan dating back four years to the run-off election for
district attorney. Fazio attributed this defeat to Board of
Supervisors President Ammiano, whose surprising challenge to Mayor
Willie Brown sent a record number of voters to the polls, many of
whom were progressive and more inclined to cast ballots for
Hallinan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an argument that Hallinan ran on the coattails of
Brown four years ago,'' said Fazio, a former prosecutor. ``This
time he had two coattails and though they were not as long, it
looks like it was enough to get him over the hump.''
</P>
<P>
   Naomi Nishioka, acting director for the Department of Elections,
made it clear that Hallinan was the victor when she updated the
election totals in an excruciatingly slow ballot count. Hallinan,
whose lead steadily increased as the days passed, led with 104,947
votes to Fazio's 103,184 _ a 1,763-vote margin.
</P>
<P>
   Nishioka said any additional votes would not affect the outcome
of the election.
</P>
<P>
   That was enough for Fazio, who said he did not plan to ask for a
recount or challenge the results. Instead, he said, he is
considering another run for district attorney in four years or for
a Board of Supervisors seat next year.
</P>
<P>
   Hallinan, whose second term begins next month, said he would
turn his attention over the next four years to some new areas,
hoping to use the power of his office to protect juveniles and the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney is San Francisco's top prosecutor,
overseeing 130 lawyers and a $26.4 million budget. The post pays
$139,899 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Hallinan, 62, narrowly defeated Fazio, 52, in the November
general election, but did not win the majority needed to escape a
run-off.
</P>
<P>
   During a race that at times turned nasty, Hallinan cast himself
as ``America's Most Progressive District Attorney,'' while Fazio,
who has worked as a criminal defense lawyer, portrayed himself as a
kind but no-nonsense prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Hallinan said it was his record as district attorney and
tenacious campaigning that pushed him to victory more than
Ammiano's presence in the mayoral run-off, which the supervisor
lost to Brown in a landslide.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants to give me credit. They say last time Willie
Brown helped me, this time Ammiano helped me,'' Hallinan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of the run-off, I was out there on my own. I was
not getting a lot of help from anybody.''

 McCAIN, BRADLEY ATTRACT THE SAME KIND OF VOTERS  
 (EDS: Filed in the ``w'' and ``p'' categories)

   WASHINGTON _ As they surge upward in the New Hampshire polls,
Democratic contender Bill Bradley and Republican hopeful Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., find themselves facing unlikely competitors _ each
other.
</P>
<P>
   With less than six weeks before the Feb. 1 New Hampshire primary
_ the nation's first _ these two anti-party mavericks are racing to
attract the same kind of voters.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of 139 Republican-leaning New Hampshire independents
earlier this month by Utica, N.Y.-based pollster John Zogby, 28.7
percent of the independents said McCain was their first choice,
with 21.7 percent preferring the national GOP front-runner, Texas
Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   No surprise there. Independents represent about 37 percent of
the iconoclastic Granite State's electorate, one percentage point
ahead of Republicans and 10 points ahead of Democrats. Swaying
independents has enabled McCain to pull even or go ahead of Bush in
most New Hampshire polls, as has Bradley in his race against Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the surprise.
</P>
<P>
   When asked their second choice for president, more of the
Republican-leaning independents selected Democrat Bradley over any
of the Republican candidates. The former senator from New Jersey
and New York Knicks basketball star got 15.5 percent, ahead of
publishing magnate Steve Forbes with 14.3 percent and Bush with 9.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The same pattern shows up for Democratic-leaning independent
voters who favor Bradley. Asked their second choice, 31.1 percent
picked Republican McCain, while 24.6 percent picked Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dynamic worth watching in the New Hampshire primary
and elsewhere,'' Zogby said. The race for the independent vote ``is
kind of a second-level primary ... A late surge for McCain may be
based on Bradley voters defecting, or vice versa.''
</P>
<P>
   Some party regulars discount the trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The polling data is (from) New Hampshire, which is obviously
different than the country as a whole,'' said Democratic National
Committee chairman Joe Andrew. ``I don't see that (as a broad
trend) at all.''
</P>
<P>
   But other polling data suggests supporters of McCain and Bradley
share an important characteristic: They care more about personality
than politics.
</P>
<P>
   A nationwide poll of 1,073 adults last week by the
Washington-based Pew Research Center for the People &AMP; the Press
showed that Bradley's support is based more on his reputation as a
star basketball player than on his liberal political leanings or
18-year record in the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, McCain's record as a U.S. Navy pilot in Vietnam who
spent five-and-a-half years as a prisoner of war is more important
to his supporters than his conservative leanings or 12 years in the
U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Genuineness and outsider-ism are things that draw people to
these candidates,'' said Andrew Kohut, the Pew Center's director.
``It's a good thing for them, but independents could be drawn from
one to the other.''
</P>
<P>
   The twinning of McCain and Bradley is surprising because they
are far apart in ideology and voting records.
</P>
<P>
   True, they appeared together in New Hampshire Dec. 16 to stump
for campaign finance reform. And both have expressed support in
varying degrees for vouchers to help parents pay private school
tuition.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain opposes legal abortion while Bradley favors it.
</P>
<P>
   McCain opposes banning guns while Bradley favors banning
inexpensive handguns, ``Saturday night specials.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain supports greater defense spending to improve military
battle readiness. Bradley says eliminating pork-barrel military
weapons programs can yield savings.
</P>
<P>
   Why are independent voters willing to leap the ideological fence
so easily?
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to do with (McCain's and Bradley's) anti-party,
anti-establishment attitude toward politics,'' said Linda Fowler, a
political scientist at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H., who
oversees the Dartmouth-Associated Press Poll in New Hampshire.
``Partly that's the culture of the state. Independent voters make
up their minds late, and they're less tied to philosophy than
personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether this pattern repeats itself in other states may depend
on whether primaries are open or closed. New Hampshire is an open
primary state, meaning any voter may vote in either party primary
regardless of party membership or lack of it. Twenty other states
have open primaries, including Michigan and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, four states (including Washington and California)
have ``blanket'' primaries. In these states, primary voters get a
combined ballot and vote for one candidate for each office,
regardless of party.
</P>
<P>
   Both the open and blanket primary systems give added strength to
independent candidates because independent voters can cast ballots
in those system, whereas they are prohibited from voting in
primaries in states that require party membership to participate in
primary voting.
</P>
<P>
   The primaries in the remaining 25 states are closed, meaning a
party primary is open only to voters who are registered with that
party. Among these are New York. Closed primaries by definition
encourage party loyalists and diminish the potential of
independents.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain and Bradley will do better in any state that allows
independents, and less well in states that don't allow them,'' said
Larry Sabato, government professor at the University of Virginia.
``This is the point where independents have influence, but after
New Hampshire the partisans will reassert control.''
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, McCain led Bush by 9 points, 39 percent to 30
percent, in a poll earlier this month by the American Research
Group. On the Democratic side, the same polling organization found
44 percent for Bradley and 40 percent for Gore.

`TALENTED MR. RIPLEY' RINGS TRUE IN SEDUCTIVE TAKE ON ETHICAL
ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' is a seductive, sly work from
Oscar-winning director Anthony Minghella (``The English Patient'').
</P>
<P>
   It throws us into a hedonistic, gorgeous world where anything
goes and then asks us to gauge what is right and wrong when things
go awry _ which they do with alarming frequency.
</P>
<P>
   Novelist Patricia Highsmith created Tom Ripley, a charming,
chameleonlike sociopath, and made him the unlikely central
character of a series of crime thrillers beginning with ``The
Talented Mr. Ripley'' in the late 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Director Rene Clement turned the story into a brilliant,
perversely chilly 1960 classic film, ``Purple Noon,'' which starred
French film idol Alain Delon.
</P>
<P>
   Minghella's version, which invites critical comparison to
Clement's film, has its own charms. It is warmer, contains a less
cut-and-dried sense of accountability, has a powerfully ambiguous
ending and is a certifiable guilty pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   There is something morbidly fascinating about the idea of a poor
young man without any sense of self or identity who is paid to
bring home the rich, perfect son of a New York shipping magnate,
then goes to any extreme to take on someone else's persona because,
after all, it's ``better to be a fake somebody than a real
nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   Minghella creates an elusive, golden, idyllic and head-spinning
world that Ripley, played with leechlike vulnerabilty and drooling
desire by Matt Damon, can barely fathom. After he's dispatched to
remove Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law) from the hedonistic ways he's
adopted in a lush, ripe 1958 Italy, Tom is as much seduced by the
lifestyle as he is by the man.
</P>
<P>
   Only one thing stands in the way of his taking over Dickie
completely: Marge Sherwood (Gwyneth Paltrow), Dickie's equally
glowing and absolutely understanding writer/fiancee, who at first
embraces Tom and then repels him after she sees through his facade.
</P>
<P>
   And once Dickie mysteriously disappears, Tom becomes strangely
omnipresent, warding off friends, family and police in a masquerade
that ends in a prison of his own making. It's a far different slant
than the one taken by Clement, but it rings more frightening and
true in this age of random acts of violence _ and it adheres to
Highsmith's own vision.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, Minghella has cast each of his actors _ save Law,
who should finally take on real movie star status with this
show-stealing turn as Dickie _ against type. He has allowed each,
including Oscar winners and nominees Paltrow, Damon and Cate
Blanchett, to tackle complex character roles. As a result, they
bring depth and humanity to their roles of people desperate to
reinvent themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' runs the risk of being interpreted
as a too accepting view of libidinous behavior or as a gay
serial-killer film. While its ambiguity is certainly the beauty and
crux of the story _ told against a backdrop of filtered, exquisite
light and Italy's crumbling, historical architecture _ the film is
really about ethical issues.
</P>
<P>
   It demands people pay attention and look inward to find the
private compass that will navigate us through murky sensibilities
that are as capable of seducing us as they are Tom Ripley. And in
an era when movies tell us everything in the first 10 minutes,
that's the beauty and point of Minghella's seductive and
entertaining moral barometer of a movie.
</P>
<P>
   The Talented Mr. Ripley. Directed and written by Anthony
Minghella. Cast: Matt Damon, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate
Blanchett. Paramount Pictures. 139 minutes. Rated R for violence,
nudity.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+

 GWYNETH PALTROW: TRYING TO FORGET ABOUT HER OSCAR

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Gwyneth Paltrow
with Matt Damon in a scene from ``The Talented Mr. Ripley.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Winning her first Oscar earlier this year _ for her
career-defining performance in ``Shakespeare in Love'' (1998) _ was
a dream come true for Gwyneth Paltrow.
 &HT;    But, the 27-year-old actress says, it was also something of a
nightmare.
 &HT;    As her latest film, ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' prepares for a
Christmas opening, Paltrow admits that she may have been too young,
or simply too new to acting and movie stardom, to cope with the
dark side of picking up the treasured best-actress statuette. She
might have been better served, she says, if she'd had more time to
develop sufficient armor to deflect the publicity onslaught that
Oscar brings in his wake.
 &HT;    Paltrow shows up for an interview at Beverly Hills' Four Seasons
hotel looking, well, thoroughly unlike Gwyneth Paltrow. I have to
look twice, actually, to make sure that it's really her.
 &HT;    Gone is the shoulder-length, golden-blonde hair that has
reminded so many of the young Grace Kelly. Instead her locks are
dark brown, colored for her role in ``Bounce,'' which she has
recently finished shooting with her on-again/off-again boyfriend,
Ben Affleck.
 &HT;    ``I think the director of `Bounce' was sick of the whole Blonde
Gwyneth person,'' she says. ``And so was I.''
 &HT;    Wearing virtually no makeup, Paltrow nevertheless looks elegant
in an ankle-length, black-leather skirt and matching top, set off
with dazzling diamond earrings which reportedly were a gift from
Affleck.
 &HT;    The timing of her Oscar was particularly unfortunate, Paltrow
says, because her life was finally beginning to settle down after
the tabloid furor over her breakup with fiance Brad Pitt. Then
along came Oscar, and the paparazzi went on red alert.
 &HT;    ``I became a prisoner in my house,'' she recalls, ``because
after a while I just didn't want to go out. One day I was driving
and the gas gauge on my car had broken, so I ran out of gas. There
are pictures of me walking down the street with a gas can, looking
for the nearest service station, and the paparazzi didn't have the
decency to give me a ride. They just wanted those demeaning
pictures.
 &HT;    ``I wanted to go hide somewhere,'' she concludes. ``I felt I
couldn't sustain all of the energy that comes with all that
attention.''
 &HT;    The whole thing was exacerbated by the fact that her acceptance
speech became fodder for late-night comedians. Not since Sally
Field's ``You like me, you really like me'' acceptance speech for
``Places in the Heart'' (l984) had so many had so much fun with so
little.
 &HT;    At the time Paltrow's father was ill, her grandfather was dying
_ he has since died, and she still can't mention his name without
tears _ and her brother was also having health problems. Not
surprisingly, the actress broke down in front of the world's
largest audience.
 &HT;    ``The nightmare about that evening was that I had one of the
most personal moments of my life in front of the whole world,'' she
says. ``I felt so terribly exposed. Of course I'd like to go back
and change some things, but that's impossible. It's there for
posterity.''
 &HT;    She reacted in the only way she knew how, by turning inward and
taking stock of her life and career.
 &HT;    ``It made me see the emptiness in everything I had achieved,''
Paltrow says. ``It's wonderful and I appreciate it, but nothing you
can buy, nothing you can do, achieve or win, no boy, no
relationship will help you retain contentedness.''
 &HT;    She plunged back into work _ a stage stint at the Williamstown
Theater Festival and several upcoming films _ determined, she says,
not to let the award affect the direction of her career.
 &HT;    ``I have been working so hard not to let it make any changes in
my life,'' the actress says. ``I still only accept roles if I want
to do them, as an artist, not because they are a potential
award-winning role.''
 &HT;    One of those roles is Marge Sherwood, the beautiful, wealthy
girlfriend of Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law) in writer/director
Anthony Minghella's ``The Talented Mr. Ripley.''
 &HT;    ``I liked Marge, she was very sweet,'' Paltrow says. ``But I
didn't understand how deep she was and how layered it all was until
I got there and started doing the film. I thought she was lighter.
I didn't realize she was so deep and warm and complicated, which is
a testament to my stupidity.''
 &HT;    Based on a Patricia Highsmith novel _ one that Minghella made
Paltrow promise not to read _ and set in 1950s Italy, the movie is
the fascinating story of Tom Ripley (Matt Damon), who is asked by a
millionaire shipbuilder to persuade his playboy son Dickie to come
home. Ripley becomes so fascinated by the lavish lifestyle Dickie
and Marge enjoy that he goes to extraordinary and disturbing
lengths to become exactly like them.
 &HT;    The film is gorgeously shot in some of Italy's most glorious
locales, and Paltrow and Law are as golden a couple as anything F.
Scott Fitzgerald ever conjured up. Which isn't too surprising,
since Minghella says he wrote the screenplay with Paltrow in mind
for the role of Marge.
 &HT;    ``She was the first person I cast,'' he says in a separate
interview. ``The character of Marge in the film _ womanly,
trusting, compassionate, a rebel in her own way _ has as much to do
with Gwyneth herself as it has to do with Patricia Highsmith's
Marge.''
 &HT;    It's a dark tale, one which some critics have suggested will be
too much for mainstream American audiences. Predictably, Paltrow
disagrees.
 &HT;    ``I think it's a very different movie,'' she admits. ``It's an
epic, Hollywood movie that is totally subversive.
 &HT;    ``But I think to say it will alienate middle America is to
underestimate those people as a moviegoing audience,'' Paltrow
adds. ``They like to be challenged as much as anyone else. Our
movie is about a very lonely, desperate person who wants to be
loved and will do anything to get that love. That's a universal
trait, that people want to get out of their own lives and inhabit
someone else's.''
 &HT;    At times, it seems, even lovely, blonde Oscar-winners feel that
urge.
 &HT;    ``I never wished I had someone else's life,'' she says
thoughtfully. ``I never wanted to be someone else _ but there were
many times when I felt really uncomfortable in my own skin.
 &HT;    ``I may have had celebrity quite quickly,'' she adds, ``but I've
had to work so hard to get respect and recognition. It's a bit like
Nicole Kidman _ she is one of the greatest actresses of her
generation, but she was never mentioned without reference to her
being Tom Cruise's wife. Until very recently, I was always
somebody's daughter or somebody's girlfriend.''
 &HT;    Paltrow's discomfort with her own success, Minghella says, shows
in her lack of confidence in her own ability and her deference to
other performers, such as ``Ripley'' co-star Cate Blanchett.
 &HT;    ``Gwyneth really underestimates herself as an actress,''
Minghella says. ``She was so in awe of Cate Blanchett, which is
deliciously ironic because everyone else knows what an incredible
actress and what a natural actress she is.''

Phillips in a scene from ``Supernova.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Diamond in the rough or unsalvageable hunk of junk?
 &HT;    On Jan. 14, moviegoers can decide for themselves precisely what
``Supernova'' is ... or was.
 &HT;    For those unaware of the ``Supernova'' saga, it's the
otherworldly tale of a would-be sci-fi blockbuster that wrapped
production in early 1998 _ with Walter Hill directing a cast that
included Angela Bassett, Lou Diamond Phillips, Robin Tunney, James
Spader, Robert Forster, Wilson Cruz and Peter Facinelli _ and has
since been subject to a series of re-edits, directorial contretemps
and release-date delays.
 &HT;    ``It is an incredibly ambitious film,'' Phillips says. ``It is,
or at least it was at the time we were working on it, more of a
cerebral sci-fi film.
 &HT;    ``I don't know what it has become,'' he adds. ``It was not a
slam-bang-'em-up. It depended on a lot of plot twists, and there
was character development going on in the piece.''
 &HT;    Phillips, the 37-year-old star of ``La Bamba,'' ``Stand and
Deliver'' and the recent ``Bats,'' signed on for ``Supernova''
because he felt Hill was taking a fairly straight-ahead story and
molding it into something interesting.
 &HT;    ``I'd actually passed on the original script,'' he recalls,
``because I didn't think the characters were there. When Walter,
who was instrumental in shaping the `Alien' franchise, came in, he
individualized each character and gave us all something specific to
do.''
 &HT;    And how did Hill improve Phillips' character, Yerzy Penalosa,
the doctor aboard the medical-rescue vessel Nightingale 229?
 &HT;    ``They gave him a love interest, for one,'' replies Phillips,
speaking by telephone from his Los Angeles home. ``I never get the
girl, man. In `Courage Under Fire' I worked with Meg Ryan,
America's sweetheart _ and I shot her.
 &HT;    ``Penalosa became a guy who's in love and gets very jealous,''
he says. ``There were two big twists in the film I thought were
very, very clever. One of them I can't reveal, but the other is
primary setup _ we find the Fountain of Youth in space.
 &HT;    ``This alien object brought aboard our ship has the ability to
reverse the aging process,'' the actor says, ``and I get involved
in a love triangle with Robin Tunney and Peter Facinelli, the guy
who brings this alien object on board.
 &HT;    ``For me, all of a sudden, there was something to play,''
Phillips adds. ``Before, I felt we were all these straight-ahead,
stock action figures. Walter came in and gave each character a
little wrinkle, something we could hang our hats on.
 &HT;    ``So we had something we could really play amidst all the
unfolding action.''
 &HT;    But rumors from the set suggest that MGM executives kept a tight
rein on Hill, forcing him to account for every minor change, for
every extra cent spent. In all his days as an actor, Phillips
acknowledges, he's never witnessed so many set visits by studio
suits.
 &HT;    Things only got worse. After filming ended, Hill and the studio
apparently failed to see eye-to-eye on the editing. Hill left the
project, and director Jack Sholder was called in to assemble
``Supernova.'' Phillips reports that he got the impression that
Sholder was trying to transform ``Supernova'' into more of a
traditional sci-fi/action film.
 &HT;    Then came an offer the producers couldn't refuse.
 &HT;    Francis Ford Coppola, director of the ``Godfather'' films and a
member of MGM/UA's board of directors, swooped in to save the day.
And so it is that ``Supernova,'' edited by Coppola and most likely
bearing a pseudonymous director's credit _ did someone page Alan
Smithee? _ will explode into theaters on Jan. 14.
 &HT;    ``This has been a fascinating process, a Hollywood film of the
highest order,'' Phillips says. ``At the end of the day, we can
say, `Francis Coppola finished the film.'
 &HT;    ``I received a wonderful letter from Francis,'' the actor adds.
``He liked the film, and asked for the opportunity to come up with
a product that the studio would be happy with and that he hoped
Walter Hill would be happy with.
 &HT;    ``It's yet to be known whether or not he achieved that,''
Phillips admits, ``but in his letter he stressed the importance of
maintaining the film's original concept. He even tossed out the
phrase `big-budget art film.'
 &HT;    ``So we'll see.''

   INTERNATIONAL-STYLE (New York) _ The Met Life (formerly Pan Am)
Building at the foot of Park Avenue is one of the worst disasters
ever to befall the New York cityscape. All New Yorkers acknowledge
the universal truth of this belief. But Kivi Sotamaa, a young
Finnish architect, likes the building very much. Most startling of
all, Satamaa appreciates the closure that the building brings to
the southern end of Park Avenue, and to the grand boulevard of
International Style office towers leading toward it. To him, and to
a surprising number of other architects and city-lovers, the
so-called Park Avenue Corridor is the architectural heart of the
20th century. The corridor is the crystallization of the New York
myth, the soaring city of work and ambition, where the sky is the
limit and dreams are fulfilled. It symbolizes New York's
displacement of Paris as the century's most vibrant City of Light.

THIS `CRADLE' IS JUST TOO CROWDED

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the Depression year of 1937, the 22-year-old, pre-``Citizen
Kane'' Orson Welles directed a pro-labor musical for Roosevelt's
Federal Theater Project called ``The Cradle Will Rock,'' which was
written by Marc Blitzstein and set in the midst of a steel strike.
</P>
<P>
   But the day of its opening, the government (possibly because it
feared the play's communist sympathies, possibly for more benign
reasons) canceled the opening, closed the Maxine Elliott Theater
and forced the company to perform the play illegally in another
venue _ making it a great succes de scandale.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Welles himself was involved with a movie project based
on this incident and wrote a screenplay (which has been published
as ``The Cradle Will Rock: An Original Screenplay''). But after the
film was cast (with Rupert Everett as Welles) and all the sets had
been constructed, the financing fell through and the project died.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cradle Will Rock'' (missing its article) is a new version
written and directed by Tim Robbins. It apparently bears no
relationship to the Welles project and fans out to not only
chronicle the famous theatrical incident but to be a broadly
comedic cross-section of the Manhattan cultural scene of the time.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, it's an interesting and likably ambitious movie
with an ensemble of mostly engaging character vignettes, but,
sadly, it misses its mark.
</P>
<P>
   At times it resembles a low-budget television docudrama, and its
efforts to be an analogy _ and a warning _ to our own time fall
flat.
</P>
<P>
   The story is set during three periods _ conception, first
rehearsals and opening night _ and weaves in and out of a tapestry
of real and fictional characters, including:
</P>
<P>
   _Composer Blitzstein, (Hank Azaria) who struggles to compose the
piece at his piano and sell it to the theater arm of the Works
Progress Administration.
</P>
<P>
   _Olive Stanton (Emily Watson), a homeless actress-singer who
wangles herself an audition and the play's prostitute lead role.
</P>
<P>
   _Nelson Rockefeller (John Cusack), a capitalist who becomes
locked in a battle of wills with left-wing Mexican muralist Diego
Rivera (Ruben Blades).
</P>
<P>
   _Margherita Sarfatti (Susan Sarandon), a Jewish Italian envoy
who is trading her country's art treasures for U.S. industrial
support for Mussolini.
</P>
<P>
   _Tommy Crickshaw (Bill Murray), a vaudeville ventriloquist who
joins a right-wing WPA employee (Joan Cusack) to rid its theater
arm of ``red'' control.
</P>
<P>
   _Aldo Silvano (John Turturro), a poor Italian American cast
member obviously based on the great left-wing character actor
Howard DaSilva.
</P>
<P>
   _Countess La Grange (Vanessa Redgrave), a silly New York society
matron and patron of the arts married to a thick-headed steel
magnate (Phillip Baker Hall).
</P>
<P>
   Also in the mix are Welles (Angus Macfadyen), his producer John
Houseman (Cary Elwes), Theater Project director Hallie Flanagan
(Cherry Jones) and such important cultural and political figures of
the time as William Randolph Hearst (John Carpenter), Marion Davies
(Gretchen Mol), Frida Kahlo (Corina Katt), Congressman Martin Dies
(Harris Yulin) and Harry Hopkins (Bob Balaban).
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Robbins tosses all these ingredients into his
pot, mixes them together with rapid cross-cutting to give the
proceedings a lightning-fast, screwball comedy pace, and hopes his
souffle will rise. It doesn't, at least not as high as he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Despite several good performances (Murray, Blades, John Cusack
and Jones, in particular), the blessings are unevenly distributed.
The film fails so consistently as knockabout comedy that it makes
one wonder if it might have worked better with a more serious
approach (as in the Welles screenplay).
</P>
<P>
   It also ends with little satisfaction. First it fails to tell us
that the play went on to many other performances and a successful
tour, and it closes with an enigmatic coda that seems to be warning
us about the dangers of corporate ownership of art. Unfortunately,
it is so vague it doesn't make its point.
</P>
<P>
   Cradle Will Rock. Directed and written by Tim Robbins. Cast:
Hank Azaria, Ruben Blades, Joan Cusack, John Cusack, Cherry Jones,
Bill Murray, Vanessa Redgrave, Susan Sarandon, John Turturro, Emily
Watson. Touchstone. 125 minutes. Rated R for some brief nudity.

`AFFAIR' FOLLOWS NOVEL MORE CLOSELY THAN 1955 FILM, BUT STILL
STRAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Publicists for the new film version of Graham Greene's 1951
novel, ``The End of the Affair,'' sent a copy of the book to movie
critics, which is a good thing because I don't think I would know
what was going on in the movie if I hadn't read it.
</P>
<P>
   When Neil Jordan announced the film last year, he was openly
contemptuous of the 1955 version directed by Edward Dmytryk and
starring Van Johnson and Deborah Kerr _ saying he didn't consider
his film a remake because the first film was ``not even close'' to
the novel.
</P>
<P>
   But, though Jordan's movie is very stylish and well-acted and
follows the first half of the novel faithfully, it takes a big
swing away from fidelity in the last act and misses the intense
religious struggle of both main characters that is the heart of the
story. The result is an engaging but essentially routine tragic
romance.
</P>
<P>
   Like the novel, it opens in 1946 postwar London, as successful
novelist Maurice Bendrix (Ralph Fiennes) has a chance meeting with
Sarah Miles (Julianne Moore), a beautiful but somewhat troubled
married woman with whom he had a long, torrid, wartime affair that
ended abruptly two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   What happened, we soon learn, is that while he and Sarah were in
the afterglow of making love at his flat on that fateful day in
1944, a German V1 buzz bomb landed nearby and nearly killed him.
When the smoke cleared, Sarah would have nothing more to do with
him. And not knowing why, it's been eating him up ever since.
</P>
<P>
   When Sarah's clueless and dull husband, Henry (Stephen Rea),
privately tells Bendrix that he suspects Sarah is having an affair,
the writer is consumed by jealousy, hires a private detective (Ian
Hart) to watch her and plunges into a quest to find out why their
own affair ended, and how he might get her back.
</P>
<P>
   In the novel, he finds _ mostly from reading Sarah's stolen
journal _ that Sarah is still deeply in love with him, but has made
a deal with God, and, though she went into the deal as an agnostic,
it sent her on a difficult, almost saintly, mystical-religious
quest that precludes a love affair with Bendrix or anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   And as he learns all this and desperately tries to pull her back
down to earth, and she resists his efforts, the total-atheist
Bendrix is brought into an internal struggle with the Supreme Being
he doesn't believe exists _ and the strange love triangle
ultimately affirms the existence of God.
</P>
<P>
   In short, it's a story with a very religious subtext: It's
completely autobiographical _ based on Greene's own affair with an
American woman in the same period, and more or less following the
story of his own intellectual and religious struggles.
</P>
<P>
   The film hits the few high points of this internal conflict in
some of Bendrix's narration and in one last-act miracle; but Jordan
_ obviously not wanting to make a ``religious'' movie _ has tossed
most of it out, combined characters, and twisted the plot into a
rather conventional tragic love story with perhaps the box-office
appeal of ``The English Patient.''
</P>
<P>
   The four performances (especially Moore and Hart) are strong,
and the visual evocation of wartime London in numerous flashbacks
has a moody beauty. But, as good as it is in all these departments,
it doesn't really work. It seems to have a hole in the center of
it: a love triangle in which one of the participants is missing.
</P>
<P>
   The End of the Affair. Directed and written by Neil Jordan.
Cast: Ralph Fiennes, Julianne Moore, Stephen Rea, Ian Hart.

GENUFLECTING AT THE ALTAR OF ADVERTISING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The green-and-white tags, secured to the towering Giving Tree
with pieces of red yarn, gently fluttered like scores of butterfly
wings in the indoor breeze made as mall shoppers hurriedly passed
by.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens upon dozens of tags hung there, each with a mini-profile
of a boy or girl who hoped that strangers would find it in their
hearts to supply a little bit of Christmas for children who might
otherwise not have any.
</P>
<P>
   Perusing the tags provided an instant snapshot of the
consumerization of Christmas and the corporatization of America's
youth _ an alphabet soup of desire.
</P>
<P>
   Interspersed with the generic requests for TVs, CDs and VCRs
were appeals for the retail icons of the late 1990s. Gameboy.
Discman. Nintendo. PlayStation. Nike. Air Jordan. Tommy. DKNY.
</P>
<P>
   The marketing masterminds must be as gleeful as Scrooge on the
morning after the Ghost of Christmas Future visited to know their
efforts are paying off.
</P>
<P>
   America's youth are worshipping at the altar of advertising
hype, bolstered by the ``synergy'' between companies and spin-off
products that puts a Pokemon in your face at the movie theater, on
TV, and in toy stores, fast-food restaurants _ even the check-out
line at the grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper cannot escape culpability here. A quick scan of
the Tuesday Family Day! section revealed a PokeWatch column for the
``gotta-buy-it-all'' shopper. How adolescent or adult can get
jazzed by that insipid yellow pillow of a monster named Pikachu and
his less-than-inspired friends is beyond me. But then, I didn't get
the whole Beanie Baby thing, either.
</P>
<P>
   Yet only a bahhing humbug would begrudge the youngsters whose
names adorned the fluttering green-and-white tags for wanting the
same things as children whose parents are more than eager and
financially able to indulge such wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the repetitive petitions for electronic gadgets and color
TVs and apparel labeled with the names of anorexic designers or
obscenely paid professional athletes were enough to make your head
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Even at Christmas, a time to celebrate the birth of the one who
came to save us all from our sins, perhaps it is too much to expect
requests for a crucifix or a Bible to mingle with the CD games and
high-dollar running shoes.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever happened to kids who just wanted a bike, or a doll,
or a sweater?
</P>
<P>
   Then I saw it. The tag that simply bore the name ``Christine''
and her clothing sizes. No special requests. No demands for
electronic gizmos or brand-name merchandise. Just small sizes _ can
anyone really have size 2 1/2 feet? _ and a statement of fact:
Favorite color is purple.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'm reading too much into it, looking for meaning when
perhaps the child just couldn't make up her mind, but what was
unwritten on that green-and-white tag secured by a piece of red
yarn to a giant artificial tree summoned like the angels who
announced His birth: I will be grateful for whatever you can give.
</P>
<P>
   Her favorite color is purple, the color of kings.
</P>
<P>
   Her name is a feminine derivative of Christ, the King of Kings.
</P>
<P>
   And she asked for nothing beyond whatever someone felt moved to
give.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping for her made my Christmas.
</P>

`GALAXY QUEST' GOES FORTH AND PROSPERS BY MOCKING SCI-FI TV 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Galaxy Quest'' doesn't exactly go boldly where no man has gone
before, but it does contain several formidable laughs and some
silly spoofing of ``Star Trek'' and the die-hard contingent of fans
who refuse to let the show rest in peace.
</P>
<P>
   Most sci-fi spoofs _ think Mel Brooks' 1987 debacle
``Spaceballs'' _ that have tried to do parodies of the ``Star
Wars'' or ``Star Trek'' phenomena have fallen flat on their
interstellar faces.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of making fun of the series' fans and their
lifestyle, ``Galaxy Quest'' targets actors and how an onscreen
image can forever lock a performer in a particular role. And that
proves to be its saving grace.
</P>
<P>
   The movie almost pays tribute to the people who slavishly
worship the genre and it pokes fun with mostly good-hearted, if
goofy, affection.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Allen plays Jason Nesmith, who starred as Commander Peter
Quincy Taggert, the popular, self-absorbed leader of the Galaxy
Quest crew. Nesmith makes his living signing autographs at sci-fi
conventions around the country and he revels in the adoration of
the show's followers, who refuse to think of him as anything other
than Commander Taggert.
</P>
<P>
   But the rest of the crew is not so happy with the way life has
turned out after their long run on television.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen DeMarco (Sigourney Weaver) is forever hounded by blond
girls in revealing uniforms who want to be just like her ``Galaxy
Quest'' character, Lt. Tawny Madison. Shakespearean actor Alexander
Dane (Alan Rickman) played ``Richard III'' on the London stage but
he's doomed to a seedy life repeating the role of the
half-humanoid, half-reptilian Dr. Lazarus from the planet Tev'Meck
at Burbank shopping mall appearances.
</P>
<P>
   There is also Fred Kwan (Tony Shalhoub), the TV show's Tech Sgt.
Chen; Tommy Webber (Daryl Mitchell), who was only a kid when he
played the ship's expert navigator, Lt. Laredo; and Guy Fleegman
(Sam Rockwell), whose one-episode character was instantly killed
off.
</P>
<P>
   The bickering bunch is pulled back into action by a dying race
of aliens who think the show was for real and need the cast's help
in a battle with their enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the stellar cast _ Rickman, Shalhoub and Rockwell are
terrific _ the film has a streak of offbeat, dark humor that
propels the one-note joke at the core of the story.
</P>
<P>
   Director Dean Parisot, who has directed TV movies and shows
prior to his feature film debut with ``Home Fries,'' is familiar
with the small-screen format and its quirks. He humorously captures
the cheesiness of the sets and the idiosyncrasies that are part of
TV science fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy Quest. Directed by Dean Parisot. Written by David Howard,
Robert Gordon. Cast: Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Alan Rickman,
Tony Shalhoub, Sam Rockwell. DreamWorks Pictures. 102 minutes.
Rated PG for mild violence.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-

THIS LITTLE PIGGY ... WENT TO HARVARD? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some readers are charmed. Others rev up a mild huff. Most,
though, are just puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   David Mamet's latest work tells the story of a self-educated and
persistent pig named Henrietta who, after being rejected from a
certain esteemed law school in Cambridge, Mass., ultimately gains
entry, becomes valedictorian, goes on to the Supreme Court, and
speaks loftily about social justice and the disenfranchised
classes.
</P>
<P>
   Like one of Franz Kafka's parables, Mamet's ``Henrietta'' seems
to be a simple children's tale about defeating the odds. But the
31-page illustrated book is being snapped up in Cambridge book
stores and has provoked speculation at Harvard Law School about the
playwright and filmmaker, and about the author's deeper meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Some see the tale of the Shakespeare-savvy swine as a thinly
veiled jab at elitism. Others view the book as an attack on what
they perceive as Harvard's legacy of discriminating against
minorities. And some believe it's just a story about making it on
your own.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an anti-elitism lesson for kids,'' said Alan
Dershowitz, the outspoken Harvard Law School professor who added a
blurb on the jacket praising the fable's ``truth.'' ``No matter
what you are, no matter what people perceive you as, you can make
it to the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Hulings, a 24-year-old law student, gleaned a different
meaning: ``The moral to me is that finding value in what other
people hold in esteem is ultimately a shallow endeavor,'' referring
to the pig's lack of success before Harvard was affixed to her
resume.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the book's illustrator knows Mamet's meaning. Elizabeth
Dahlie, a Wellesley artist who jazzed up Henrietta with a red
ribbon on her squiggle of a tail, glasses perched low on the sow's
snout, and a crimson-striped muffler to help her brave the cold,
said: ``Really, I'm not sure. I just drew the pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   Mamet did not clear up the confusion. He declined an interview
through his agent in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But if the book is chiding Harvard Law School for the period in
its history when it excluded almost everyone except white males,
officials at the nation's oldest law school are quick to come to
its defense.
</P>
<P>
   About 47 percent of the students in the class that entered this
fall are women and more than 25 percent are minorities, said Mike
Chmura, a Harvard spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look for people who provide some difference, who have made
good use of their opportunities, who have overcome disadvantage _
just like Henrietta,'' said Joyce Curll, the law school's
admissions director. ``We have probably the most diverse law
school. If Mr. Mamet really looked around at this institution, he
would see that.''
</P>
<P>
   While the student population has grown more diverse in the past
decade, the law school's faculty has been slow to change. Of 79
professors, only 13 are women and eight are minorities, Chmura
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mamet, known for his black-humor plays including the Pulitzer
Prize-winning ``Glengarry Glen Ross'' and provocative movies such
as ``Wag the Dog'' and ``The Spanish Prisoner,'' named his heroine
after a pig once owned by his friend, the wealthy Boston developer
and presidential host on Martha's Vineyard, Dick Friedman. The
developer named the restaurant in his Charles Hotel in Cambridge
Henrietta's Table, after his departed sow.
</P>
<P>
   And while Mamet never comes out and calls the ``Great
University'' by name, illustrations clearly depict Cambridge's
Charles Square and the Weeks Memorial Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The story starts with the learned pig leaving her solitude and
studies on some ``Eastern Isle'' to follow her dream of addressing
juries. ``Having seen the barriers to the Professions crumble
before now this and that disadvantaged group,'' Mamet writes, ``she
presented herself at the institution of her choice.''
</P>
<P>
   But without credentials or an undergraduate degree, the law
school rejects her. Later, after ``she haunted the libraries and
folded herself into the backs of the lecture halls,'' the school
banned her. Dahlie, the illustrator, paints a sign hanging from a
door: ``No pigs.''
</P>
<P>
   After living like a bum in the streets of Cambridge, things
change for the better for Henrietta. She meets the ``Old
Vagabond,'' who turns out to be the Great University's president.
But the president misplaces his glasses and doesn't realize she's a
pig. He's so impressed with her knowledge of Hamlet, Oedipus, and
Henry Fielding, that, even after he discovers she's a pig, he
invites her to attend the law school.
</P>
<P>
   Henrietta marches onward from there. And so have sales of
Mamet's book.
</P>
<P>
   But while many may be reading it, they are often left shrugging
quizzically.
</P>
<P>
   Leaning over his thick textbooks and cramming for his final at
the Harvard Law School's imposing library earlier this week, a
25-year-old law student shook his head after reading ``Henrietta''
several times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's driving at something,'' Jake Erhard said. ``But
I'm not quite sure what it is.''

2000 CHRYSLER LHS: BIG, STYLISH AND POWERFUL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GRIFFITH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You have to pay for the gas (it's getting expensive if you
haven't noticed), but opinions are still dispensed for free at
Irving's Service Center in Stoneham.
</P>
<P>
   For example, we'll take today's subject: a 2000 Chrysler LHS.
</P>
<P>
   I pull up to the pumps and walk inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, that's a nice-looking car,'' says Irving.
</P>
<P>
   ``How's the sound system?'' asks son Matt, looking up from the
study guide for his upcoming test on the new auto inspection
equipment. ``I hear it's really something special.''
</P>
<P>
   I flip Matt the key and watch him crank up the windows and sound
on the four-disc, in-dash CD changer that's part of a 360-watt
system with Infinity speakers in nine locations. As I walk out to
finish gassing up, the smile on his face tells all as he leans back
in the seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got it right,'' he says as he relinquishes the car in
exchange for gas money.
</P>
<P>
   That applies to more than the sound system.
</P>
<P>
   This is the big car your father always wanted to drive, except
it's only been built for the last two years. And it is right.
</P>
<P>
   It's also big. And stylish. And comfortable. And powerful. And
luxurious. And built in America.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, and it's fun to drive.
</P>
<P>
   And for you, the son or daughter? All of the above holds true,
too.
</P>
<P>
   The LHS, a sibling of Chrysler's performance-oriented 300M, has
plenty of strong selling points of its own. Under the hood, they
share the same 3.5-liter, 24-valve V6 that puts out 253 horsepower,
enough to get an LHS from 0-60 in 7.7 seconds with good economy (18
m.p.g. city and 27 highway).
</P>
<P>
   The LHS is a little longer than the 300M, offers a softer (but
not spongy) ride, has more interior and trunk space and comes at a
decent price: $28,090 (ours added the CD changer at $515 and
17-inch chrome wheels at $750).
</P>
<P>
   The styling _ as it is across the Chrysler line _ is stunning,
and the reliability in these big cars is encouraging. The black
(heated) mirrors and a black trim strip between the hood and
windshield offset the bright silver of our test car. The LHS shares
the retro-look, airplane-styled dash instrumentation of the 300M,
including an analog clock (we won't argue with Chrysler's claim
that the cluster is reminiscent of Swiss-made watches).
</P>
<P>
   On the road, a trip with four aboard to Worcester saw the LHS
cruise easily at 80 and hold the road just fine. In town, where the
Central Artery is a tougher test, a late-night drive home on a
rainy night saw the suspension hop through the ruts a bit but
perform nicely overall.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't cold enough that week for the wet roads to turn to
black ice that would test the traction control, but, returning home
from the Globe in the wee hours one Sunday night, I got to give the
four-wheel disc brakes and antilock braking system a real-life
test.
</P>
<P>
   As I came onto the Expressway North at Columbia Road, an Acura
and Honda raced past, door handle to door handle in excess of 90
mph, rapidly disappearing from sight. A mile or so down the road,
they came a cropper in the South Station Tunnel, leaving a trail of
metal, plastic, glass and vital (automotive) fluids all over the
road with one car against each wall. The young lady driving the
Honda already had crossed over and was ``communicating'' with the
Acura driver who seemed OK but was unable to open the well-battered
driver's side door.
</P>
<P>
   The LHS made a quick, straight, pedal-pulsating stop, then
gingerly followed an 18-wheeler through the mess. A call to 911
went unanswered, leaving the conclusion that the trucker already
had officialdom on the phone. Ten minutes later, WBZ's traffic
report relayed news of a multicar crash in the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the LHS seemed removed from the fray.
</P>
<P>
   Family and friends who came along during the week commented
favorably on the ride, the styling and the roominess of the
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The leather seats were comfortable and heated. Heated seats
always sounded like a ``Who needs 'em?'' amenity _ until I tried
them. They're one of life's welcome luxuries, and just this week I
heard of a driver who uses his all year to ease a chronically
aching back.
</P>
<P>
   The obligatory cupholder report: Hit a bar on the front of the
center armrest and a double cupholder pops out. It was fine for our
various test beverages: a medium cardboard coffee cup, a soda can,
and an insulated travel mug, keeping them safely within reach and
out of the way of all controls.
</P>
<P>
   The equally-obligatory owner's manual report: You'll need to
read it to fully understand the many features of the
climate-control and audio-CD systems. Only a true gadget-person
will figure them out completely without help.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   --Power, styling, spaciousness, combination of ride and
handling.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --No easy place to put a turnpike toll ticket (the CD changer
took care of any in-dash cubbyhole spaces).
</P>
<P>
   --It took time to get the seat/mirror adjustments just right.
And rearview mirror visibility was somewhat limited.

U.S. CAPITOL TO CELEBRATE ITS BICENTENNIAL  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Dec. 26)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 By JUDY HOLLAND   
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Congress first moved into the new Capitol on
the Potomac nearly 200 years ago, lawmakers viewed the classical
white marble building in the wilderness as a symbol of balance,
stability and harmony for the rapidly growing nation.
</P>
<P>
   They never envisioned that the British would stack Library of
Congress books on members' desks in 1814, sprinkle them with gun
powder and set the House and Senate wings ablaze until only the
walls were left standing.
</P>
<P>
   They never expected the Capitol would become a barracks for the
first Union troops at the start of the Civil War in 1861 and that
the famous 19th century poet Walt Whitman would nurse wounded
soldiers in the Rotunda.
</P>
<P>
   And no one imagined these halls would become the scene of a
murder in 1889, when Louisville Times reporter Charles E. Kincaid
fatally shot former Congressman William Preston, a Kentucky
Democrat, who had threatened him for writing an unfavorable story.
</P>
<P>
   To capture these historical jewels and others, the U.S. Capitol
Historical Society is celebrating the Capitol's 200th anniversary
by sponsoring a traveling exhibit of the history, art and
architecture of the building. The exhibit will visit the capitals
of all 50 states starting next spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to take the Capitol to the public,'' says
Clarence J. Brown, a former Republican congressman from Ohio and
retiring president of the historical group. ``We are not educated
today in the civic history of our country as well as we should
be.''
</P>
<P>
   For the bicentennial, the society will sell a replica of the
gavel that George Washington used to lay the cornerstone of the
Capitol in a Masonic ceremony in 1793.
</P>
<P>
   Despite long-standing efforts to identify the cornerstone,
historians remain divided over exactly where it is located in the
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ask anyone in the Capitol where the cornerstone is and you
get a fight,'' says Brown. Brown says he believes the cornerstone
was accidentally carried out of the Capitol when the East Front was
expanded in 1959. He suggests that the silver plate it was laid
upon has disintegrated over time.
</P>
<P>
   But George M. White, architect of the Capitol from 1971 to 1995,
scoffs at Brown's theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question in my mind'' that the cornerstone lies in
the corridor of the East Front of the Capitol, near a carryout
cafeteria, White says. A stone at that site is unusually large and
matches descriptions in early newspaper accounts, he notes.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Wolanin, the curator of the Capitol, says the federal
building deserves more study as ``the symbol of democracy both in
our country and in the entire world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The more people understand about the history of the art and
the building itself, the more they'll get out of the experience of
being in the building,'' Wolanin says. ``Hopefully more people will
want to understand it and to take care of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit will explain how the states decided which of their
famous residents would be portrayed in the Capitol's Statuary Hall.
Two statues of people prominent in the state's history represent
each state.
</P>
<P>
   One panel of the exhibit will show how the Capitol's classical
Greek and Roman architecture is reflected in state capitals across
the country.
</P>
<P>
   The display will explain that the Capitol's classical lines were
intended to symbolize that America's political system was designed
like the democratic republics in Greece and Rome, instead of like
the British monarchy that the settlers had left behind.
</P>
<P>
   The group is also extending its reach into cyberspace next
spring by launching The Web Site of the History of Congress, a
guide that eventually will include biographies of more than 12,000
federal lawmakers who have served since the First Continental
Congress in 1774.
</P>
<P>
   Plans are also underway for educational forums for high school
students, which are ``intended to bring kids into contact with
people who are public servants and inspire them to want to become
active in their communities,'' says Matt Wasniewski, the society's
associate historian.

TO TRANSFER DATA FROM OLD TO NEW, YOU'LL NEED CONNECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I just bought a new PC and need to transfer all
the stuff from my old hard drive to the new one. My old PC has
Windows 95 and the new one has Windows 98. When I got the old one,
I used a DOS program called InterLink to transfer files, using a
cable between the two computers. I don't remember how to do it and
can't find anyone who knows what I am talking about.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moving day
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DAY: Don't let that bother you. I can never find anyone who
knows what I'm talking about either. In fact, sometimes even I
don't know what I'm saying. Here's one thing I do know, though: It
doesn't matter if Microsoft has a simple way of doing things,
because it'll shove it under the rug as soon one of its Poindexters
comes up with a way to do the same stunt in Windows, even if it's
three times as complicated.
</P>
<P>
   InterLink was a wonderful little DOS 6 utility allowing two
computers to share files. Then along came Win95's Direct Cable
Connection, and things really got gummed up. Now you had to make
sure all your networking properties were set just right and that
file sharing was turned on and take care of about a dozen other
nuisances. If you did manage to get it to work, the remote
computer's drives were only visible in the DCC window, not in
Explorer or other applications.
</P>
<P>
   If you've still got InterLink stashed somewhere, you'll probably
have better luck with it. First, connect the computers' parallel
ports with a cable you can get at almost any computer store, or
glom one from anybody who's bought a copy of pcAnywhere or LapLink.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure one of the computers (the client) has Interlnk.exe on
it; the other (the server) should have Intersvr.exe. On the client,
edit the Config.sys file to include the line
``Device\KInterlnk.exe,'' including a path if necessary. Reboot it.
Start the other machine in DOS, and type in ``Intersvr.'' That
should connect the two, and the server's drives should be visible
on the client.
</P>
<P>
   Once they're connected, you'll be able to copy all your data
files to the new machine by dragging and dropping in Explorer.
Don't try it with applications, though. Do fresh installations
instead. When you install a Windows program, support files get
slapped all over your hard drive. Simply copying a program's folder
to a new machine isn't going to copy them, and it's definitely not
going to update your system's Registry with all the info it needs
to make the program work the way it was intended.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that will help in configuring a new PC or make fixing
the old one easier is a CD burner. If you use a lot of shareware,
save your registered installation packages on a CD-ROM along with
the latest hardware drivers, newest virus signatures and anything
else you want to find in a hurry _ besides a baseball bat _ when
you suddenly have to rebuild your PC.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I seriously need help breaking e-mail
passwords. I know what they write about me, and I want it to stop.
</P>
<P>
   _ Heightened Awareness
</P>
<P>
   DEAR AWARENESS: And what makes you think I'm not one of
``them''? Why don't you first try direct confrontation instead of
illegal subterfuge? Or better yet, why don't you e-mail all their
dirty little secrets to the world? But I'm not telling you how to
break into anybody's e-mail. Then you'd be able to see our secret
plans for world domination.

CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR EXPECTS SOME PROBLEMS WITH DATE CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ The state command center is ready. The
National Guard is prepared. High-tech telecommunication devices are
being installed in Gov. Grady Davis' Los Angeles condominium and
downtown office. His staff is working overtime. Yet the
always-cautious governor still expects problems next week related
to the millennium date change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure something will go wrong,'' Davis said Wednesday,
sounding a little like Eeyore, the gloomy donkey from ``Winnie the
Pooh.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure some streetlights won't work, some ATM machines won't
work, but we can live with these things,'' he said. ``As long as
the prison doors don't open and the water projects don't stop
functioning and the major systems keep functioning, we'll be
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he would attend three parties in Los Angeles on New
Year's Eve, then ``probably be home by 12:20 to check in with the
Office of Emergency Services,'' which has set up an elaborate state
command center at its headquarters outside Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Y2K team is convinced absolutely nothing will go wrong.
Having lived almost 57 years, I am sure something will go wrong,''
Davis said again.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have a host of contingency plans in the ready,'' the
governor said.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Information Technology says 100 percent
of California's essential computer systems are prepared for the
date change. The state has spent about $100 million making sure its
computers will work.
</P>
<P>
   Because earlier software and some models of computers were
programmed to recognize only the last two digits of a year _ the
``99'' in 1999, for example _ computer experts say it is possible
that equipment that has not been updated may think 2000 is 1900.
That could result, these experts theorize, in breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   If there are widespread problems, the governor has the power to
call out the 22,000-member Army and Air National Guard and declare
states of emergency. About 1,700 National Guard soldiers will be
training New Year's weekend. The training exercises will allow the
Guard to deploy troops on a few hours' notice.
</P>
<P>
   All state activities will be coordinated through the Office of
Emergency Services in suburban Sacramento. Three other regional
offices _ in Oakland, Southern California and Sacramento _ will
filter information to the command center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that the computer systems are reliable; those seem to
be OK,'' said Tom Mullins, a spokesman for the Office of Emergency
Services.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Emergency Services has prepared a Y2K booklet in
eight languages, available on the agency's Web site,
www.oes.ca.gov.
</P>
<P>
   The booklet advises people to store one gallon of water for each
family member for each day. Residents should have enough
non-perishable food to last each person three to seven days, it
says, and keep extra supplies of medication, a first aid kit and
critical medical records. Have some extra cash on hand and keep
your gas tank at least half-full, the Office of Emergency Services
also advises.

DON'T FORGET THE VICTIMS IN THE CARRUTH CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEFFRI CHADIHA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The body of Cherica Adams was honored and buried
in Charlotte, N.C., Saturday. Let's hope her memory won't fade any
time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Misfortune has struck the Southeast. A young woman is dead. Her
infant son entered the world three months before his time. An NFL
player stands charged with a crime so heinous that death may be the
consequence of his alleged actions.
</P>
<P>
   But as we begin to sort through the details of how former
Carolina Panthers wide receiver Rae Carruth wound up facing a
first-degree murder charge for conspiring to kill Adams, his
girlfriend and supposedly the mother of his recently born son
Chancellor Lee Adams, let's be sure to not become so consumed with
Carruth that Cherica and Chancellor become bit players in his
plight.
</P>
<P>
   If Carruth is indeed a victim himself, the courts will determine
that. But Adams and her child are the most significant victims now
and we can't ignore the possibility that as this story builds
steam, it may become more about Carruth and less about them.
</P>
<P>
   This is a scary topic already, both for the sketchy details
already supplied and the interest it has generated. True, Carruth
isn't O.J. Simpson and Adams isn't Nicole Brown Simpson. We're
talking about a subpar receiver (who was recently waived by
Carolina) and his unknown girlfriend he dated for more than year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even without the Juice's juice, this crime should appall and
not bore us. An NFL player stands accused of murder and if he is
found guilty, he will almost certainly face the death penalty. When
was the last time that happened?
</P>
<P>
   We live in a sports culture where Lawrence Phillips' return to
the NFL generates ethical debates, where Latrell Sprewell chokes
his former head coach and winds up telling his story on ``60
Minutes.'' Now we have a pregnant woman slain as she sat in her
car, and the level of outrage just doesn't fit the crime. This is
why we should worry about Adams and Chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If their story doesn't appeal to us much now, it's unlikely that
it will in the midst of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The overall coverage of this incident already has been sparse.
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks have passed between the time of Adams' shooting and
her funeral in Charlotte, and few details about either the victim,
the crime or the alleged perpetrators have leaked out of North
Carolina. This much we do know:
</P>
<P>
   That the 24-year-old Adams and Carruth, who is 25, had dated for
about a year; that on the night of Nov. 16, she was sitting in her
black BMW when someone opened fire on her, hitting her four times
in the neck and abdomen; that Chancellor Lee was delivered by
Caesarean section and is believed to be the son of Carruth; that
Carruth had already fathered another child and had financial
problems; and finally, that after the police arrested three other
men along with Carruth, two fingered Carruth as the chief
conspirator and within days of Adams' death, Carruth stashed
himself in the back of a friend's Toyota and fled to Tennessee,
where the police eventually caught him.
</P>
<P>
   Within the media, that should be enough to open some eyes and
turn a few heads. But there is a feeling that we've been down this
road, with the Simpsons most notably. Their drama clearly had
theatrical appeal long before it swelled out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Most people had opinions, theories and agendas concerning the
subject, and as a result that story probably jaded the response to
a situation like that of Carruth and Adams. Or is there more to
this than that?
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, that Adams was an exotic dancer when she met
Carruth was unearthed along with information of a relationship she
had with former Charlotte Hornet and current New York Knick Larry
Johnson. Though these elements of the story shouldn't be viewed
suspiciously, they do make Adams more real to those who didn't know
her, which also means that people are starting to take time to
discover who she was.
</P>
<P>
   One concern here is that she will wind up portrayed as just
another woman about to bear a child to a wealthy athlete, that
because she performed lap dances for a living, she didn't merit the
kind of sympathy or outrage generated by the death of a Nicole
Simpson. Even worse would be to overlook the long-term effects on
Chancellor, who was born fighting for his own life, and both the
Adams and Carruth families.
</P>
<P>
   The boy faces a world of potential custody battles and his
mother will only come alive through the memories of others.
</P>
<P>
   The Adams family is just learning about an existence without
their daughter, and the Carruths may have to do the same if their
son is found guilty and receives the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the predictable story will be how Carruth declined
from a first-round pick into a murder suspect. He is about to start
fighting for his freedom. But once this legal process starts
rolling, let's pay special attention to the woman who died too
young and a child whose innocence was robbed at birth.

&HT;     NOT-SO-PERFECT BOOKS OFFER GOOD CAREER LESSONS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I get dozens of career books each year. A handful are so
wonderful that I write about them right away; most of the rest get
discarded in a hurry. But there is a third group: Some books are
intriguing enough to be useful to some people, but have one flaw or
another that keeps me from wholeheartedly recommending them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they are too good to ignore. Some could be perfect gifts,
if you know someone who fits into a particular book's niche
audience. Here are four such books, ones I was able to put down,
but couldn't throw away:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Who Moved My Cheese?'' by Spencer Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   If this book would just come out in paperback for $9.95 or so, I
would recommend it without hesitation. But it is only the size of a
long magazine article and sells for $19.95, which would buy a heck
of a lot of Gorgonzola.
</P>
<P>
   The main part of the book is a parable about four mice who live
in a maze and survive by eating cheese. One day the cheese
disappears from its usual place, confounding a couple of the mice.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, co-author of ``The One Minute Manager,'' uses the
parable to illustrate how difficult it can be to deal with change,
and what people need to do not only to survive, but to thrive.
</P>
<P>
   The people who struggle most in their careers these days are
those uncomfortable with change. They had a job that was at least
reasonable, then the company merged or they got laid off or their
duties changed dramatically. They dwell on what used to be rather
than moving on.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's book can help them. It also can be useful when life
gives you a nasty twist, like a serious illness or divorce or the
death of a loved one.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Clarity Quest,'' by Pamela Ammondson.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most valuable things you can do in your career is
take a sabbatical, giving yourself some time to think about how
things are going and whether you need to go in a new direction.
</P>
<P>
   But many jobs don't let you take a break, and some workers can't
afford any unpaid time off because they live from paycheck to
paycheck. Ammondson's book tries to help, describing how you can
take a sabbatical of sorts while using up only one week of vacation
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clarity Quest'' outlines an eight-week process, but only the
eighth week involves taking time off from work. During the first
seven weeks, Ammondson guides you through various exercises
designed to help you relax and focus on the things that really
matter in your life.
</P>
<P>
   The book is too touchy-feely for my tastes, and I think a lot of
people could achieve the same results on their own, if they just
took the time to focus on their careers and their lives.
</P>
<P>
   But many people simply don't know how to begin. Even if they
take a sabbatical, the only insight they will gain is from watching
``Oprah.''
</P>
<P>
   If you know something needs to change in your career or your
life and you are not sure how to approach it, ``Clarity Quest''
could help.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Power of Positive Criticism,'' by Hendrie Weisinger.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the advice in this book ought to be superfluous;
managers with a few street smarts ought to know how to criticize
employees constructively, and rank-and-filers ought to appreciate
the need for criticism to help the company function better.
</P>
<P>
   But often they don't.
</P>
<P>
   Weisinger's book offers insights into why criticism is valuable
and how it is often abused. He explains how bosses need to use
careful timing and just the right words to correct employees
without making them feel hurt or bitter.
</P>
<P>
   Rank-and-filers can benefit from the book as well. The book
explains how to handle touchy situations, such as criticizing your
boss or dealing with co-workers who are constantly negative.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The 75 Greatest Management Decisions Ever Made ... and 21 of
the worst,'' by Stuart Crainer.
</P>
<P>
   There are some classic lessons in here, such as Henry Ford's
innovations in automobile manufacturing, and how Walt Disney
listened to his wife, Lillian. He wanted to call his cartoon
character Mortimer Mouse, but she thought that was a Mickey Mouse
idea.
</P>
<P>
   The 21 bad decisions are also useful, particularly because some
of them were made by people like Ford (who decided to build
submarines during World War I) and some of the leaders of Silicon
Valley. Even brilliant people can screw up royally.
</P>
<P>
   The book's biggest flaw is that it is overly ambitious. Having
75 decisions makes it seem too much like a laundry list rather than
offering much insight.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Crainer's book could be a good reference for a lot of
managers, and a reminder of how fine the line can be between
brilliance and stupidity.

&HT;     DIRECTOR EXAMINES THE NATURE OF FACADES IN `MOTHER' 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By WESLEY MORRIS  
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until ``All About My Mother,'' there were two faces to Pedro
Almodovar. The angular, style-is-substance one and the downy-soft
one that feels increasingly touched by an angel.
</P>
<P>
   (It should be noted that even the angels in an Almodovar film
wear leopard-print miniskirts and Gucci shades.)
</P>
<P>
   But since ``The Flower of My Secret'' in 1996, and most
alarmingly with ``Live Flesh'' in 1997, he's been experimenting
with a formalism that felt conventional, like someone was standing
over him saying, ``Oh, behave!''
</P>
<P>
   How does a man ostensibly fed up with being the Agnes (``All My
Children'') Nixon of Spanish cinema satisfy fuddy-duddy critics who
have derided him for his lack of maturity and emotional sincerity?
He gets introspective and makes a movie about sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   For Almodovar, looking inward is unusual therapy that is as much
to do with his artistic loves as his deepest self. Soul
searchingly, he's dedicated ``All About My Mother'' to ``all
actresses who have played actresses, to men who act and become
women, to all the people who want to be mothers.'' It's a
romantically labyrinthine tribute that piles layers of intertextual
shout-outs to ``All About Eve,'' Tennessee Williams, Truman Capote
and Alfred Hitchcock, and beautifully assesses the nature of
facades. Once you peel away the performance, what is left is the
emotion it masks.
</P>
<P>
   Sincerity was not something Almodovar's films needed  &Cx1f; _ there is
no more sincere and smitten a socio-sexual gamesman.
</P>
<P>
   His mothers were never just mommies, they were Madonnas of the
highest, most glamorously neurotic order. To see him flirting with
conventions like the flaccid noir in ``Live Flesh'' was upsetting
because you could see him struggling to ``grow up'' by trying to
keep a straight face.
</P>
<P>
   But in ``All About My Mother,'' Almodovar imbues his
Harlequin-novel-meets-Marvel-comic-book melodramas with something
more than a wink and a smile, and it's beguiling.
</P>
<P>
   His expressionism and his screenwriting have always had fun
together, but now there is a kind of faith and spirituality that
sexcapades like ``Laws of Desire'' and ``Kika'' only laughed at.
</P>
<P>
   The film is about Manuela (Cecilia Roth), a Madrid nurse
dedicated to her teen-age son Esteban (Eloy Alzorin), who is
writing a story about her. Her birthday presents to him are
perfectly thematic _ Capote's ``Music for Chameleons'' and a
production of ``A Streetcar Named Desire.'' In a shatteringly shot
and performed sequence, Esteban is killed chasing Huma Rojo (Marisa
Parades), the show's Blanche du Bois, in her limo one rainy night.
If there is a difference between the Almodovar of old and the one
working here, it has been the replacement of irony with a more
astral, less literary idea of destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Before, with Almodovar, a sudden tragedy like Esteban's death
would have weakened Manuela, depraved her. But here and in Roth's
delicate hands, Manuela is an emblem of sacrifice, nearly crippled
by grief.
</P>
<P>
   She sets out to fulfill her son's birthday wish: to know his
father. As Manuela heads to Barcelona to find Esteban's father,
``All About My Mother'' unfurls into a journey film, the breadth of
which makes for Almodovar's most profound writing. Where he was
once an iconographer and cartographer of a woman's identity, he has
now forsaken sex, per se, for gender, eroticism for sensuality.
While other aging directors (Almodovar is only 48) from Scorsese
(``Bringing Out the Dead'') to Lynch (``The Straight Story'') are
looking for humanism, Almodovar is merely plumbing the depths of
his own.
</P>
<P>
   Every soul Manuela encounters in Barcelona _ from Huma and her
co-star (and lover) Nina (Candela Pena) to the philosophically
narcissistic transsexual Agrado (Antonia San Juan) and the
pregnant, AIDS-struck nun (Penelope Cruz) _ is cosmically,
symbiotically stitched into her quest.
</P>
<P>
   ``All About My Mother'' is Almodovar's 14th feature, but it
contains a host of superlative firsts: a handful of the only truly
moving scenes he has filmed, the most gorgeous dialogue he has

DEBORAH NORVILLE SAYS NO TV BEFORE BED

<P>
   Kids watching a little too much TV? Are you concerned that
images of bad guys in video games just before bedtime make for a
restless night? Snuggle up together with ``I Don't Want to Sleep
Tonight,'' a new children's book about the perils of television
viewing written by Deborah Norville.
</P>
<P>
   That's Deborah Norville, an Emmy-winning reporter who anchors
the TV magazine ``Inside Edition.''
</P>
<P>
   She's well aware of the irony in someone who has made a career
in broadcasting telling children and their parents that there
sometimes are better things to do than be a couch potato.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who better to say turn off the tube?'' Norville said. ``I've
been very blessed to work on TV and, Lord willing, I'll continue to
do so. But I don't think there's anybody who works on `Inside
Edition' that thinks kids should watch it.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the rhyming, lift-the-flap book (Golden Books;
$12.99) came from Norville's experience with her 8-year-old son
Niki, big brother to Kyle, 5, and daughter Mikiela, 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote this as a poem for my little boy who tended to watch
more TV and play more video games than he should, and those tended
to be the same nights when he had what we call the `scaries,' those
middle-of-the-night, calling-for-help (nightmares).
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell a child something and it goes right past them,
but if they make the discovery themselves there's a greater chance
that it's going to stick. So I thought, `How can I help him make
that connection?' and I thought of making up a rhyme.''
</P>
<P>
   Norville is in the habit of composing little bits of poetry for
her children for different occasions, so her message flowed easily
in that form.
</P>
<P>
   ``The verse that came to me was,' ... and one thing I have
noticed about these visits from these creatures, they only come on
nights when I've seen some TV features,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So using that as the center point, I worked my way back to the
annoying monsters that were bugging you when you were trying to
sleep, and then going forward to dreamland, which is a really cool
and wonderful place if you hadn't been glued to the tube before you
tried to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Norville and her husband, Karl Wellner, have set limits on
their children's TV watching and video game time: No TV or video
games Mondays through Thursdays, and none Friday until after
school. During the weekends, they are allowed to watch television,
but Norville and Wellner try to steer them away from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've become much more proactive about offering alternatives
to television,'' she said. ``If it's a Saturday and our son says,
`Hey, Mom, can I go play Nintendo,' we don't say, `No,' flat out.
What we try to do instead is say, `Yeah, but you know what, we've
got that new football, and you asked me the other day to go play
football and now would be a great time.' We try to offer
alternatives. Often if you get engaged in another activity with
your children, they forget they wanted to play Nintendo or watch
TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many times they're making that choice out of boredom _
`There's nothing else that seems intriguing so I'll watch TV or
I'll play video games.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Norville said she recently learned that Golden Books wants her
to do a series of books along the same lines, possibly illustrated
by Rachael O'Neill, who did the vivid crayonlike drawings in ``I
Don't Want to Sleep Tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Norville said if the book does become a series, the next entry
might be based on a poem she wrote for Niki when he was dealing
with a bully: ``Today I feel sick. I will not go to school/My
stomach feels wiggly, my hands clammy and cool./I squeezed shut my
eyes, tried hard to sleep./I saw nothing but visions of Ricky the
creep.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't a dream I've had, but it's been one of the most
fulfilling professional experiences I've ever had,'' Norville said
of her first children's book, now in its second printing just six
weeks after hitting the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of the book is television is a great thing and it
can open horizons, but great things should be enjoyed in moderation
and there are just wonderful worlds that can be opened in a
book.'' &QL;

OLIVER STONE TACKLES FOOTBALL IN `ANY GIVEN SUNDAY'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: EMBARGOED until Sunday, Dec. 26) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago, word was out that Oliver Stone was going to make
a football movie. The National Football League did not consider
this to be good news. Stone would show up at games, and league
officials would warily watch him out of the corners of their eyes,
trying to see just what the maverick filmmaker was up to, in the
same way, say, a dog peers at his owner who has a bottle of shampoo
and garden hose in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you blame them?'' asks Dennis Quaid, who plays an aging
quarterback in Stone's movie, ``Any Given Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL is a corporation, just like Disney, and corporations
like that have a thing about their image. And if you have a loose
cannon like Oliver roaming around, you'd have every right to be a
little concerned about what he's going to do to that image.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a whole lot, it turns out. Sure, ``Any Given Sunday'' is
filled with drugs, prostitutes and violence _ the staples of an
Oliver Stone movie _ but in the end, the film plays almost as a
loving homage to football, a sport Stone calls both a ``pagan
rite'' and ``the religion of America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's America's version of the gladiator games of Rome, taking
place on Sunday, the day people used to go to church,'' Stone says.
``It's ritualized violence. But it's allowable. It's legal _
unlike, say, marijuana.''
</P>
<P>
   That is Stone's pointed way of pooh-poohing (and perhaps calling
your attention to) his recent arrest for hashish possession, his
second such offense. At 53, Stone may be a little old to be playing
the rebel, particularly for someone who has made so much money
making commercial films for Hollywood studios. But he still likes
to provoke _ both with his movies and his personality _ even if he
has moved away (although not by choice) from chronicling his own
fevered version of history.
</P>
<P>
   ``People expect Oliver to be out there on the edge,'' Quaid
says. ``They not only expect it, but they seem to like it. It's
like, `Oh, look what he's doing now.' I find people's reaction to
him a curious mix of envy and disdain.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL's reaction to Stone's script, not surprisingly, was one
of outright dismissal. Stone was thus compelled to create a
fictional football league (the Association of Football Franchises
of America), complete with made-up teams (the Miami Sharks are the
featured franchise), uniforms, logos and a championship game for
the ``Pantheon Cup.'' (The name is another nod to the
football-as-gladiators concept, as is the footage from ``Ben-Hur''
that Stone inserts into the film during one of the coach's big
speeches.)
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks' coach, Tony D'Amato, is, appropriately enough,
played by Al Pacino, no stranger to screaming or vein-bulging
speech-making. Tony is a for-love-of-the-game guy, disconcerted by
the way corporate money has transformed football into a business
instead of a sport. Quaid plays the old-school quarterback; TV's
Jamie Foxx is the up-and-comer who spends more time making
commercials than studying the playbook. And that's OK with the
team's owner (Cameron Diaz!), who has a pragmatic, market-oriented
approach to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunday'' also features a host of football players, past and
present, including Hall of Famers Lawrence Taylor and Jim Brown in
featured roles, and five other legends (Y.A. Tittle, Dick Butkus,
Bob Sinclair, Warren Moon and Johnny Unitas) in cameos as coaches.
Former Dallas Cowboys coach Barry Switzer also shows up, playing a
sportscaster paired with Stone himself.
</P>
<P>
   Stone's movie doesn't exactly call any audibles in its depiction
of the win-at-all-costs mentality prevalent in professional
football. ``North Dallas Forty'' got there 20 years before, and did
a much better job in showing the various abuses football players
must endure for the team. Where ``Sunday'' breaks new ground is in
portraying the ways the sport has become less a game than a weekly
pageant run by and for large corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football today is all about the spectacle and the show,'' says
Brown, the former Cleveland Browns star, generally considered to be
the greatest running back who ever played. ``Now, there's nothing
wrong with the hoopla and the dancers. It makes for a good show.
But it doesn't make for a good sport. Everything today is motivated
by money. Owners want it; players want it. It dilutes the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this being an Oliver Stone movie, the purity of the
game ultimately becomes secondary to the bone-rattling violence
(``in six-track Dolby stereo!'' Stone enthuses) and the indelicate
extracurricular activities. (``Tell me something,'' Stone asks.
``Have you seen more beautiful women in a movie per cubic feet?
Have you? I love women!'')
</P>
<P>
   These twin obsessions often had a way of turning the ``Sunday''
set into a giant locker room, a place where, Quaid says, ``chaos
reigned supreme'' and ``your manhood was challenged on almost a
daily basis.'' Actors learned to be football players; football
players learned to be actors. The football players had an easier
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of a lot of days, I needed a Tylenol IV,'' says
Foxx, who played quarterback in high school. ``The problem was that
you'd get hit and there would be something wrong with the camera
angle, so they'd have to film it again ... and again ... and again.
They gave me the option of using a stunt double, but in the same
breath they told me I'd be a pansy if I did so. You heard the
`pansy' word a lot during those football scenes.''
</P>
<P>
   For Taylor, who played linebacker for 13 years with the New York
Giants, hitting people didn't pose much of a problem. Remaining
patient did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I don't mind contact,'' Taylor, now 40, says. ``But
in a movie, you've got to do the same thing so many times that it
gets old. I wanted to ask: `Aren't you professional? Can't you get
it right the first time?' But seeing as it was my first movie, I
thought it best to keep my mouth shut.''
</P>
<P>
   During the down time, Taylor took notice of some striking
similarities between Stone and his old Giants coach, Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things that make Bill Parcells a great coach _ his
personality, his attitude, his ability to see things other people
don't see _ are the same things that make Oliver a great
director,'' Taylor says. ``Oliver will say something to you and you
won't understand a word of what he's talking about, but then you do
it, and you say, `Wow. That's why he makes all those great, weird
movies.'''
</P>
<P>
   When told of the compliment, Stone laughs, and admits there are
some similarities between himself and another coach _ ``Sunday's''
fictional leader of men, Tony D'Amato. For one, both are men who
are more comfortable among men. For another, both wonder if they
are perhaps past their prime. Self-pity colors their worlds. And
then there's the shared propensity for screaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is D'Amato,'' says Jamie Williams, a former tight end for
the San Francisco 49ers, who had a hand in developing the movie's
script.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I have a life,'' Stone counters. ``But, yeah, we share
the same intensity, the same appetites. And I love football.
There's something about sports that brings men together and excites
their passions. The players get to be savages out on the field, and
we live vicariously through that. To me, that's a beautiful
thing.'' &QL;

THE 2,000 BEST THINGS ABOUT TELEVISION, ACCORDING TO TV LAND
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: EMBARGOED until Monday, Dec. 27) 
 
 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are lists that serve as uncanny mirrors of our society _
Time magazine's People of the Year, for example, or the Beatitudes
as delivered by Jesus during the Sermon on the Mount, or David
Letterman's Top 10 lists. Then there are lists that are patently
and risibly pointless, a waste of everyone's time and energy _ the
American Film Institute's 100 best films of all time, Joe
McCarthy's Hollywood 10 during the Red Scare of the '50s, or
anything compiled in Entertainment Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the lists that are so patently and risibly
pointless that they serve as uncanny mirrors of our society. Which
brings us to TV Land's recent declaration essaying the 2,000 Best
Things About Television.
</P>
<P>
   Folks at the cable outfit worked long, but apparently not too
hard, to concoct this list. The point seems to be to get media
pundits across the country opining over what morons in their right
mind would rate the Pocket Fisherman (671) above the Skipper from
``Gilligan's Island'' (686), who for some unknown reason ranks
higher than Richard Pryor (1,305) !ital!and!off! ``Rocky and
Bullwinkle'' (1,034).
</P>
<P>
   Not wanting to disappoint anyone, here are my observations.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the list is aimed at the imbecile in all of us. MTV is
in the top 30 _ of a full 2,000 things, remember _ while HBO didn't
crack the top 100. Edward R. Murrow barely makes the top 200, a few
notches above ``Athletes mouthing the words `Hi, Mom.''' ``The
Sopranos,'' gaining steam as the best TV series ever, barely makes
the top 700, while special compilations of TV commercials comes in
150 slots higher! Tony Danza is considered better by 60 positions!
``The Brady Bunch'' gets 15 separate mentions! The outrage!
</P>
<P>
   ``The rerun'' is No. 9 _ remember, all TV Land does is show
reruns _ while ``Saturday Night Live,'' which has been excruciating
a heck of a lot longer than it was ever actually funny, is No. 14,
with at least 34 other separate entries, like Mr. Bill (227) or
``Deep Thoughts'' (1,205), most of them from the early, funny days.
``Wayne's World'' ranks 278, while Wayne himself is a lowly 1,043 _
did the people compiling the list even bother to pay attention to
what they were up to? If so, they might have wondered where,
besides the phone book, Jon Lovitz (1,561) could possibly come
before Eddie Murphy (an astonishing No. 1,880, just one slot ahead
of Jack Carter).
</P>
<P>
   And that's just a smidgen of the inconsistencies within the
small subset of ``SNL'' listings (which inexplicably accounts for
1.5 percent of !ital!all!off! that is good about television). We
have a full 50 years of logical lapses to pick apart here.
</P>
<P>
   Relax _ we don't have the stomach for it, either. Let's look at
some pointed choices.
</P>
<P>
   David Letterman (No. 23) ranks !ital!waaay!off! ahead of Jay
Leno (312); Letterman comedy bits rate eight other slots, while I
couldn't find one other reference to Leno _ even Conan O'Brien, who
at 485 follows Leno, has at least three routines elsewhere on the
list. Johnny Carson, of course, blows them all away: He's No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Multiple Emmy winner and incredibly prolific guy David E. Kelley
only rates a lowly 1,485 on the list, below ``Battle of the Network
Stars'' and just above ``Two Fat Ladies.'' (Someone must've
!ital!really!off! hated ``Snoops.'') Steven Bochco, on the other
hand, is at 359. The highest-ranked person who actually wrote and
created a show is James L. Brooks (34), followed by Rod Serling
(70) and Carl Reiner (196).
</P>
<P>
   Only ``The West Wing'' (608) and ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' (1,839) ranked from the latest TV season.
</P>
<P>
   Some interesting if unlikely calls: the skier's crash landing
opening ``Wide World of Sports'' (No. 57), episodes in which
characters get amnesia (79) or get discovered by Hollywood (850),
Emergency Broadcast System tests (244), the spit-take (588), TV
show board games (1,009), lunch boxes (1,208) and novelizations
(1,363), when a fading show adds a strange new character, often a
child (1,712).
</P>
<P>
   What were they thinking?: Soap operas (No. 87), Billy Jean King
vs. Bobby Riggs (101), Fonzie's leather jacket (261, while the
wimpy blue cotton one from the first season doesn't rate at all),
``I'd like to buy a vowel'' (543), the E! channel (1,148),
``Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp'' (1,626), !ital!two!off! Bob Uecker
references (1,184, 1,344).
</P>
<P>
   Overrated: Live news coverage (No. 5), the Super Bowl (12),
weather reports (31), Fonzie (93), Mr. Haney on ``Green Acres''
(379), Richard Dawson (787), Horshack from ``Welcome Back, Kotter''
(792), technical difficulty cards (908), plate-spinning acts
(1636), ``Arli$$'' (967), ``The Flintstones''' Bamm-Bamm (1,470),
Donny Osmond (1,358), the Osmonds (1,805), ``Seinfeld's'' music
sting (1,634), ``America's Funniest Home Videos'' (1,686), Screech
on ``Saved by the Bell'' (1,999), Charo (2,000) and ABC (1,533).
</P>
<P>
   Underrated: Monty Python's Flying Circus (No. 55), Ernie Kovacs
(167), Bill Murray (343), ``The Larry Sanders Show'' (376),
``Mystery Science Theatre 3000'' (1,912), Mr. Rogers changing his
shoes (675, though it outranks the whole show, at 680), ``Space
Ghost: Coast to Coast'' (718), Dr. McCoy's ``I'm a doctor, not a
...'' line on ``Star Trek'' (1,060), ``Watching the White Bronco''
(1,207), Darren McGavin (1,818), the episode where Mr. Ed plays
baseball (1,268), Emma Peel's leather jump suit (1,275).
</P>
<P>
   Odd juxtapositions: Ellen's coming out (128) is considered just
slightly better than TV commercials (129). ``The Munsters'' bests,
barely, Sarah Michelle Gellar, 1,176 to 1,177. Stuart Margolin
(1,786) and Jesse ``Maytag Repairman'' White (1,790) rank higher
than Katie Couric (1,793). Sally Field's Oscar acceptance speech
(354) rates higher than she does (484). The Pillsbury Doughboy
(363) rates higher than ``The Prisoner'' (364). The ``60 Minutes''
ticking watch (477) barely edges out ``Casper, the Friendly
Ghost's'' theme song (478). ``Wessonality'' outranks ``Everybody
Loves Raymond,'' 1,097 to 1,101.
</P>
<P>
   It's all relative: ``The Simpsons'' episode ``Who Shot
Montgomery Burns'' ranks significantly higher (297) than the
``Dallas'' episode it parodied (1,129). Farrah Fawcett's hair (496)
outranks Farrah herself (573), a fairly crucial distinction. David
Duchovny ranks 638, and his character Fox Mulder weighs in at 723,
while ``The X-Files'' itself is only 752; Duchovny's crush on Larry
Sanders comes in at 1,656.
</P>
<P>
   TV Land somewhat modestly places itself at No. 239. TV critics
rank No. 1,939, which strikes me as somewhat generous _ whoever
compiled this list clearly has never attended TV press tour, or
they wouldn't have made the list at all. &QL;

`TITUS ANDRONICUS': CRUELTY HATH A HUMAN FACE, A HUMAN HEART 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(jt) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A director seeking a path into Shakespeare's goriest play,
``Titus Andronicus,'' basically has two choices.
</P>
<P>
   One is to keep a safe distance from a repellent story that many
regard as one of Shakespeare's lesser efforts by treating it as a
slice of stylized Grand Guignol and staging its chain of murders
and mutilations as the blackest of comedies.
</P>
<P>
   The other, riskier way, which the director Julie Taymor has
adopted in her shattering screen adaptation, renamed simply
``Titus,'' is to shoot the moon and take the play extremely
seriously. In peering into the raging hearts of characters
hell-bent on destroying one another and inflicting maximum pain and
humiliation, Ms. Taymor discovers many unsettling contemporary
resonances.
</P>
<P>
   This splashy elaboration of Ms. Taymor's 1994 Off Broadway
production turns ``Titus Andronicus'' into a fluid time-traveling
fantasia on violence and revenge that has the look and feel of a
sophisticated video game.
</P>
<P>
   One minute we are in ancient Rome, the next in Mussolini's
Italy, the next in an ``Alice in Wonderland'' world of life-size
toy soldiers, the next in a video-game arcade.
</P>
<P>
   As these environments collide and merge, we find ourselves in a
surreal, time-collapsed dream world, a murderously supercharged
virtual reality where the characters loom as recurrent historical
archetypes.
</P>
<P>
   Playing this fast and loose with Shakespeare, of course, carries
a price. Ian McKellen's 1930s fascist ``Richard III,'' for
instance, came off as a glibly streamlined, if entertaining, gloss
on Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   And while ``Titus'' is quite faithful to Shakespeare's text, the
mixture of the ancient and the contemporary and of British
theatrical and American film acting styles can be jarring. Alan
Cumming's flamboyantly prancing, leering, insecure boy emperor,
Saturnius, seems to belong in a different movie from Jessica
Lange's quietly seething Empress Tamora.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Taymor's floating the play through shifting time zones
and locations also pays dividends. It's impossible to watch
``Titus'' without considering the mass slaughters in the Balkans
and Rwanda, and even the Columbine High School killings. What was
then, she forcefully reminds us, is also now.
</P>
<P>
   In connecting these recent horrors to the characters in
``Titus'' Ms. Taymor made the audacious editorial decision to begin
and end the movie with images of children.
</P>
<P>
   The story is prefaced by a scene of a little boy gleefully
stirring up imaginary carnage on a kitchen table with toy soldiers
and ketchup. His private little war game builds to an imaginary
explosion that magically plunges him Alice-like through a tunnel
under the floor into the world of the play.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the film, after most of the major characters have
finished one another off, we see the child, presumably wiser after
all he has been through, leading another child (the illegitimate
son of two of the story's revenge-crazed butchers) into the future.
If this ambiguous ending suggests the possibility of healing, we
also shudder to imagine the legacy of hatred the orphan might be
harboring.
</P>
<P>
   From its opening images, ``Titus'' portrays violence as an
escalating fever, an addictive mass hysteria that consumes the
characters and turns them into bloodthirsty fiends. That notion
seems to be borne out by what we know of the killing fields in
Rwanda and Cambodia, to name two countries where mass slaughter
became commonplace in recent times.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the film, in one of its most indelible and
grotesque images, the title character (Anthony Hopkins), who has
gone mad, throws a cannibalistic banquet of revenge in which he
dons a contemporary chef's uniform to serve meat pies to the
Empress Tamora and her husband made from the bodies of her two
sons.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins got it right in a recent interview when he described his
Titus as a mixture of King Lear and Hannibal Lecter. His
performance, one of his finest, is ghoulishly funny and emotionally
devastating all at once.
</P>
<P>
   The sight of this great actor in a chef's hat, cackling
grotesquely while serving up human carnage, is a coup de cinema by
the director celebrated for her transfixing theatrical images in
shows like ``The Lion King'' and ``Juan Darien.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout ``Titus,'' Ms. Taymor's background as a gifted
puppeteer whose inanimate creations convey a primal psychological
charge is evident. The film's most searing image finds Titus'
daughter, Lavinia, who has been raped and mutilated by Tamora's
sons, reduced into a human scarecrow with branches planted in the
stumps of her severed hands and red ribbons streaming from a mouth
from which the tongue has been removed.
</P>
<P>
   Those murderous sons, Chiron (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) and
Demetrius (Matthew Rhys), are punkish speed-freak sociopaths
straight out of ``A Clockwork Orange.'' Their mother, who ascends
from captured slave to empress, is an elaborately tattooed pagan
goddess for all seasons clad in gold lame and matching gold
breastplates.
</P>
<P>
   The revenge cycle begins when Titus, a popular Roman general,
victoriously returning with his Goth prisoners of war, refuses to
spare the life of Tamora's eldest son and slays him before her
eyes. Ascending to power as the wife of Saturnius, Tamora plots
revenge with Aaron (Harry Lennix), her black servant and lover, who
engineers much of the carnage.
</P>
<P>
   Seething from a lifetime of racial humiliation, Aaron is the
play's (and the movie's) ultimate symbol of the hate that begets
hate. Lennix's cool, wily Aaron stands as the ultimate, vengeful
product of a toxic racism.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, Ms. Taymor has said she wants to help lift
``Titus Andronicus'' from its relatively low regard in
Shakespeare's canon. And her fine, provocative film makes a strong
case for ``Titus Andronicus'' to be taken much more seriously than
it has been.
</P>
<P>
   But any play in which revenge is the single guiding motivation
for most of the characters most of the time inevitably lacks other
human dimensions. In any case, ``Titus'' makes the best possible
argument for a cautionary drama that contemplates the absolute
worst in us.
</P>

ANTIQUES: ROCK CRYSTAL FOR KINGS AND GODS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By WENDY MOONAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Christmastime is just the season for rock crystal,
which has long been revered for its purity, its lucidity and its
magical play of light.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Christians, light penetrating rock crystal is
traditionally symbolic of the Immaculate Conception,'' Sylvie
Raulet writes in ``Rock Crystal Treasures From Antiquity to Today''
(Vendome Press, 1999). ``The Virgin Mary is the crystal and her
son, Jesus Christ, the celestial light.''
</P>
<P>
   The Christian church has always used rock crystal, an especially
colorless form of quartz and the symbol of purity. Angels are often
seen wearing rock crystal pendants in paintings, like Piero della
Francesca's ``Madonna of Sengallia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Middle Ages, rock crystal was mostly used for religious
objects,'' said Tony Blumka, the owner of Blumka Gallery, at 209 E.
72nd St. in Manhattan, which specializes in medieval, Renaissance
and Baroque art. ``It was considered very precious. It was even
used just to take the place of glass.'' The Metropolitan Museum of
Art has a 14th-century faceted rock crystal beaker from Germany
with gilded silver mounts and cover that came from his gallery and
is on display at the Cloisters.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Barnet, the Met's curator of Medieval art and the
Cloisters, said that ``hundreds of thousands of pieces of rock
crystal from the Middle Ages have been lost.'' The Met has a church
monile, or necklace, of silver gilt and rock crystal from the early
16th century. ``It would be kissed by the priest during the
celebration of the Mass,'' Barnet said. ``Ours has rubies set into
it and a hexagonal piece of rock crystal at the center with the IHS
monogram of Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1500s Pope Clement VII commissioned a small rock
crystal casket to give to King Francis I of France on the occasion
of his son's marriage to Caterina de Medici. It was decorated with
gold, enamel rondels and intricately carved rock crystal panels
with scenes from the life of Jesus. It was created about 1530 by a
master craftsman from Vicenza, Italy, named Valerio Belli, who is
mentioned in Vasari's ``Lives of the Most Eminent Italian
Architects, Painters and Sculptors.'' It took two years to make and
cost 2 million florins. It is now in the collection of the Museo
degli Argenti in Florence.
</P>
<P>
   Francis I must have loved rock crystal. He built a royal
treasury in a tower of his chateau in Fontainbleau to display his
most sumptuous objects, including a silver-gilt and rock crystal
ciborium (which holds the eucharistic bread) and a pair of
magnificent rock crystal candlesticks festooned with gold, pearls
and garnets that were made about 1530 and later presented to the
Treasury of the Order of the Holy Ghost. They are now in the
Louvre.
</P>
<P>
   Monstrances on church altars were made of imperfect rock
crystals whose fissures were meant to symbolize the ``tears of
Christ.'' Rock crystal reliquaries containing the precious bones of
saints are often encrusted with pearls and jewels. Clement VII
alone commissioned 41, and they were shown to the public only twice
a year, on the Saturday of Holy Week and Easter Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It seems amazing that bejeweled rock crystal reliquaries have
survived from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. But as Ms.
Raulet put it, ``Anyone who dared steal or damage these treasures _
consecrated because of the relics they contained _ would be
excommunicated.''
</P>
<P>
   More and more antique rock crystal is coming on view now. The
Gilbert Collection, which will go on display at Somerset House in
London in May, for example, includes a splendid tankard from
Strasbourg. ``Rock crystal was much prized in the Renaissance
because it was supposed to be able to detect poison,'' said Timothy
Schroder, the curator.
</P>
<P>
   Rock crystal has been worked since the third millennium before
Christ and carries different meanings for different cultures. The
Egyptians used it in their jewelry and in the eyes of sculptures.
The word is derived from the Greek word for ice, krystallos,
because the Greeks thought rock crystal was formed by water frozen
on mountaintops at such extreme temperatures that it could no
longer melt. In many cultures it was considered a divining stone,
and mediums still use a crystal ball to communicate with the forces
of nature.
</P>
<P>
   In China, rock crystal is said to symbolize victory. ``Rock
crystal was not used much in China,'' said crystal dealer Jim
Lally. ``It's rare.'' He has a rock crystal bear from a late
Warring States or Han burial site in Shandong Province and is
asking $40,000 for it.
</P>
<P>
   The quality of rock crystal carving seems to have deteriorated
in Europe from the 18th century to the 20th. The Paris dealer
Nicolas Kugel sells only rock crystal carved in the 16th and 17th
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gem-cutting tradition initiated by the Medicis faded out
after Louis XIV,'' he said. He is particularly proud to have
17th-century gold-mounted rock crystal cups carved by the Milanese
artist Miseroni, he said, adding, ``He worked for most of the
courts of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Kugel was the underbidder for the famous Moor's Head cup that
Sotheby's sold in London on Dec. 17 for $2,859,580, a record for a
silver object sold at auction in Britain. It was a marriage cup
belonging to the Royal House of Saxony. The head, with a rock
crystal feathered headdress set with precious stones, was made by
the goldsmith Christoph Jamnitzer (1563-1618).
</P>
<P>
   The cup was the top lot in the 143-lot sale of the Moritzburg
treasure, which was buried in wood crates in the forest of the
family estate outside Dresden during World War II as the Soviet
army approached. It lay there undiscovered until 1996, when it was
found by an amateur treasure hunter who called the authorities. It
was displayed in a museum in Dresden in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In this century, rock crystal has been a popular mineral for
jewelry designers, especially Faberge, who single-handedly revived
the princely tradition of rock crystal works meant to be displayed
as status symbols. Cartier, which made Gloria Swanson's
diamond-studded rock crystal cuffs, continues to use rock crystal
in jewelry and clocks similar to those designed in the 1920s and
'30s.
</P>
<P>
   Paris jeweler Alain Boucheron began to reintroduce rock crystal
years ago. A true enthusiast, he uses it for objets d'art, clocks,
jewelry, even chess sets. He has created a bestiary of animal
motifs in rock crystal.
</P>
<P>
   ``A rock crystal represents at once both turbulence and
limpidity, and its dual, even ambiguous nature is the very essence
of the mineral's magic,'' he wrote in the preface to Ms. Raulet's
new book. ``It conjures up all that is finite yet never-ending,
instantaneous though eternal; both heat and cold, immobile yet
changeable. This explains why Georges Sand said that it represented
the limit between `the visible and the invisible.'''

SKI-VIRTUAL-SLOPES) 
 
 
By PHIL DAVIS 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   USC physical therapist Wendy Burke offers the following tips for
people who are planning to hit the slopes this ski and snowboarding
season _ and not end up in one of her grueling rehabilitation
sessions to rebuild a torn muscle or dislocated shoulder:
</P>
<P>
   _ Get loose: Do lunges, squat thrusts and leg stretches to
loosen the muscles up before putting on skis or a snowboard. This
gives the muscles flexibility so joints can go through a full range
of motion.
</P>
<P>
   _ Build strength before skiing: Muscles in the lower extremities
_ quadriceps, hamstrings and calves _ get a workout during skiing
or snowboarding, and they need to be both flexible and strong.
Working out on stairs (jogging or walking up and down) or a stair
machine works out the muscles used for skiing and is a great way to
build the strength and endurance needed to spend a day on the
slopes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't forget the heart muscle: Biking, walking and any form of
aerobic exercise helps prepare the heart for a workout on the
slopes. This also builds endurance.
</P>
<P>
   _ Work on balance: The worst crashes happen when a loss of
balance triggers a catastrophic chain of events. A skier should be
able to stand on one leg for two minutes without wobbling. Burke
suggests trying this while doing the dishes, brushing your teeth or
talking on the phone. It two minutes is easy, take it further by
shooting baskets or hitting tennis balls on one leg. This will help
the body learn to compensate for the constant changes in center of
gravity that occur while skiing. &QL;

SKI-VIRTUAL-SLOPES-TIPS) 
 
 
By PHIL DAVIS 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For Susan Baumgard, having snow rushing past her
cheek as she slashes down the slopes on her snowboard is an
``addiction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I dream about it,'' said Baumgard, 34, an Encino native who
worked as an instructor at ski resorts in Mammoth and Lake Tahoe,
``I've been skiing since I was 9 years old. And I lived for 10
years in the mountains, so I was getting 150 days on my snowboard
(a year).''
</P>
<P>
   Then, a few years ago, two accidents _ ironically unrelated to
snowboarding _ forced her to withdraw from the slopes. She couldn't
work. In fact, some days she could barely move. ``I had to pretty
much pop four Advil every six hours just to live,'' Baumgard said.
</P>
<P>
   But today, three years after it seemed she'd retired her
snowboard and ski parka for good, Baumgard is planning a triumphant
return to the slopes.
</P>
<P>
   She credits her recovery to a unique University of Southern
California sports medicine program that not only helped
rehabilitate her injured body but also taught her snowboarding
techniques that won't aggravate her old wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Baumgard is among the first graduates of USC's fledgling ski
deck program. The $30,000 machine is similar to one you'd find in a
swank ski chalet, or at the home of a world championship skier _ a
rolling carpet serves as snow, and a computer monitor helps create
the illusion of racing down the slopes. Safety bars and a harness
prevent falls.
</P>
<P>
   USC orthopedic surgeon C. Thomas Vangsness and physical
therapist Wendy Burke see the machine as a tool to help return
athletes to an activity they love _ the goal of any sports medicine
program _ and also train better skiers who are less likely to get
hurt on the slopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty novel; there are only three in the state of
California,'' said Vangsness, co-director of the Center for
Athletic Medicine at USC-University Hospital. ``I want to get them
up there to try their knee reconstruction, or, if they have an
injured shoulder, to practice their poling, to get in there in a
real situation _ what we call a sports-specific activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as a computer user must learn how to type correctly after
surgery to correct carpal tunnel syndrome, a skier needs to teach
his or her body to use the proper muscles after surgery to repair
an injury. In both cases, Burke said, it's a matter of correcting
bad habits the body develops while trying to compensate for an
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get injured, it's normal to cheat,'' she said. ``Your
body is like water going down a mountain, it goes to the path of
least resistance. When you step on a tack, you'll either hop on one
foot, or if it went in your heel, you'll just walk on the toe of
your foot. You still get from point A to B, you're just going to do
it differently.''
</P>
<P>
   When the injuries are severe _ like Baumgard's _ the bad habits
stick.
</P>
<P>
   She wrenched her shoulder during a tumble down a flight of
stairs in 1995, then suffered severe whiplash in a 1997 car
accident. Intense pain _ so severe it sometimes made her vomit _
caused her to use all the wrong muscles to do things as simple as
walking her dogs. It twisted her until she stood, as she describes
it, ``like a chicken.''
</P>
<P>
   Vangsness repaired her damaged shoulder with laser surgery and
realigned it during a nonsurgical procedure. Baumgard worked out
with Burke for more than three painful years to rebuild the injured
muscles, but even then a return to snowboarding seemed risky. In
September, she had recovered enough to be among the first patients
to try out the ski deck. Only patients who are almost back to
normal are allowed to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Burke discovered the deck while recuperating from her own knee
injury. She was nervous about reinjuring her knee, and friends at a
ski shop steered her to championship skier Bob Salerno, who was
selling training time on his personal ski deck.
</P>
<P>
   Burke, trained to watch how muscles work, immediately saw the
deck as a great tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can really discriminate the fine subtleties of how people
cheat or compensate,'' she said. ``The (ski slope) is very
forgiving. We can not be perfect and still get down the hill pretty
well. Most of the balance stuff happens instantaneously. You kind
of ziggle zag and wiggle wob and catch your balance. On the ski
deck, if you start to go off balance, it exaggerates all your
imperfections. It makes it easy for me to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Its safety features allow a skier to work on one problem at a
time without worrying about falling or hitting an ice patch or a
tree.
</P>
<P>
   The ski deck was an easy sell to her boss, Vangsness, an avid
snowboarder and believer in creating realistic situations that get
his patients back into their game.
</P>
<P>
   Vangsness hopes the deck's safety features will appeal not only
to injured skiers but also to worried parents who don't want to
turn their kids loose on a snowboard without proper training. USC's
sports medicine program offers ski lessons on the deck at $100 an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get parents with kids who want to snowboard or
ski _ which is pretty darn dangerous _ to come on down, and we'll
teach them how to do it the right way,'' said Vangsness, who broke
a couple of ribs on his first snowboard excursion. ``They can train
on it, practice their edge control and balance and do it with a
safety belt around them.''
</P>
<P>
   Baumgard said the deck is a great training tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can get it all together on the deck, you're going to be
a great skier on the hill,'' she said. She said it gave her the
confidence to once again indulge her addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait _ if it would just snow,'' Baumgard said. ``I was
going to go (two weeks ago), but there's no snow. I need it to dump
some footage before I go out there. The last thing I want to do is
get up on a snowboard, fall on a rock and hurt myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so excited,'' she continued, ``if I have to travel to
Colorado to do this, I'll do it. I won't eat so I can go

CHRISTMAS 1899, JUST LIKE THE ONES I NEVER KNEW

Thomas Mallon's novels include ``Dewey Defeats Truman'' and ``Henry
and Clara.'' His latest novel, ``Two Moons,'' will be published in
February.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There has never been any doubt that in the spectral
trinity Dickens created to preside over the Yule holiday, the Ghost
of Christmas Past reigns as first among equals _ the prime mover of
mood and spirit. Christmas might, in fact, be characterized as a
holiday in continual, necessary decline, a celebration whose
emotional center is our insistence upon the superiority of
Christmases gone by. White Christmases are, by definition, the ones
you used to know.
</P>
<P>
   The impulse to see yesterday's Yuletides through a glowing,
fir-scented mist of nostalgia is hardly a modern one. A glance at
the pages of The New York Times for Christmas week 1899 shows our
late-Victorian ancestors indulging in the same sentiments we feel
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day had not been especially favored by the fickle weather
clerk,'' The Times reported on Dec. 26, 1899. After a stretch of
unseasonable warmth, Christmas turned out ``cloudy for the most
part, with intervals of sunshine, and a brisk, cold breeze, lacking
both the cheer of continuous brightness and the appropriate gift of
a snowstorm.'' The ``two trifling flurries of snow'' only teased
``the spirits of the youngsters to whom Santa Claus had brought
sleds.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper had been braced for disappointment for days. On
Dec. 23, the lead article in its Saturday Review of Books and Art
raised the cultural question: ``Is the Christmas Spirit Decaying?''
It appeared to the essayist that ``into this beautiful custom there
has crept a sort of materialism _ a commercial spirit.'' The author
had less objection to the amount of money being spent than to the
automatic, cheerless way in which the till was jingling: ``There is
too much of the give-and-take feeling, the balancing of virtues,
and the idea that gifts must be sent because received.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there had been ``a great apparent decrease in the number of
jolly-looking people, with tired but happy faces, and arms full to
overflowing with bundles.'' Couldn't everyone remember how, not so
long ago, ``one package-laden individual looked at others who were
equally burdened; the whole scene, the shops, the streets, the
people, producing a certain friendly feeling _ the real Christmas
spirit of love and good will toward all men''?
</P>
<P>
   A hundred years later, as we do our online shopping, filling the
virtual basket with one more point and click, we are equally
tempted to recall yesteryear's sharp elbows and stolen cabs as
having been one long pink-cheeked festival of urban cheer. But it
is memory, and the elaborate tricks played upon it by Christmas,
that turns every crotchet into a Cratchit, each fuhgedaboudit into
a fa-la-la-la-la.
</P>
<P>
   The Times writer, who knew his complaint was already ``an old,
old one,'' wondered if the trouble comes ``simply because we are
growing older and losing our capacity for illusions.'' Actually,
our capacity for nostalgia, the grandest illusion of all, is the
single faculty that expands as we get older, with Christmas the
evergreen herbal firing its big annual growth spurt.
</P>
<P>
   At Christmastime in 1899, New York City seemed to keep its mind
more on the holiday than the approaching turn of the century, and
when the future did force itself upon the mind, there was the
comforting possibility that things might not change so much after
all. E.S. Nadal, writing for the paper on Dec. 24, predicted that
even with the advent of the bicycle and trolley and automobile,
``it does not follow that the use of horses will be superseded or
even very greatly circumscribed by them.'' There is not, alas, much
comfort here for those now counting on the survival of the printed
book and retail store.
</P>
<P>
   At the close of 1899, the nation was generally in a mood to
count its blessings. With the Spanish-American War well over, the
bodies of sailors blown up on the Maine 22 months earlier were at
last returning for home burial: President William McKinley would
preside over ceremonies at Arlington on Dec. 28. Those New Yorkers
who found the warmer-than-usual weather still too cold for comfort
could let themselves be tempted by an advertisement in The Times
for Puerto Rico, ``Uncle Sam's new possession, this charming
island.''
</P>
<P>
   Things across the Atlantic were not nearly so sunny. France
remained riven by the Dreyfus case, and England had just suffered
unexpected reverses in the Boer War. Queen Victoria, spending her
life's second-to-last Christmas at Windsor Castle, wished only for
a stiff upper lip.
</P>
<P>
   The Times reported, ``It was ... her express desire that the
grandchildren who assembled about her today should not have their
Christmas marred by the events which have saddened her own heart.''
</P>
<P>
   If the United States was enjoying peace and the beginnings of
its own little empire, Christmas nonetheless magnified the
country's two-nations problem of rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
   The Times' lead story for Dec. 26, 1899, concerned the previous
day's feeding of 20,000 needy New Yorkers by the Salvation Army in
Madison Square Garden. The practice had begun only the year before,
and the newspaper's account paid attention to not only those
serving and being fed, but also to an upper crust of spectators who
had come to watch a show:
</P>
<P>
   ``In the boxes and gallery of the great building during the
evening, when the feast was at its height, sat many thousands of
well-fed and prosperous people, among them many women who had come
in carriages and were gorgeously gowned and wore many diamonds, who
looked on in happy sympathy.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The modern reader may think the reporter's tone is meant to
convey revulsion, or at least irony, but two column inches down one
encounters a heartfelt description of ``the splendid bridge that
yesterday spanned for one brief day at least the chasm that yawns
between the rich and the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``The Battle for Christmas,'' historian Stephen
Nissenbaum surveys press coverage of this event and finds how
``only a single report, in The New York World, suggested that what
had happened was more a matter of voyeurism than of class
reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the rich were beset with some anxieties of their own.
The stock market had recently taken a sharp dip, and ``one
prominent jewelry house had had over 300 orders canceled since the
panic.'' Keene's, on Fulton Street, placed a sizable ad in The
Times promising that it would be open on Christmas Day ``owing to a
large number of articles reserved and not called for.''
</P>
<P>
   If the rich no longer gawk quite so crassly at the feeding of
the poor, the city's vast middle class, after its own big dinner,
still indulges in the slightly pharisaical pleasure of watching
television news crews invade New York homeless shelters to film
celebrity servers and embarrassed diners.
</P>
<P>
   One more easily counts one's own surfeit of blessings by toting
up the scarcity of others, which is why stories of Christmas crime
and catastrophe pack an especially hard punch. 'Tis the season when
fire seems made not just for the hearth, but for the tenement and
crib as well. Two days before Christmas 1899, readers of The Times
found a lengthy front-page story from Quincy, Ill., concerning 11
children killed in a Nativity pageant rehearsal:
</P>
<P>
   ``Laurena Menke, aged 9 years, who was to impersonate a lamb in
a tableaux of the birth of Christ, came in contact with the
gaslight, and the cotton batting from her costume was at once
enveloped in flames, which by running about in her wild frenzy, she
communicated to the costumes of other girls, who, in turn, spread
it still further among the children.''
</P>
<P>
   The details of this lamb-to-the-slaughter tale jump out, however
horrifically, in the spirit of the season, which is wondrously,
cosmically ironic: the world's Savior born in a stable; the last
ready to be made first. Forever after, the promise of redemption
has shimmered more brightly, more mysteriously, beside sudden,
terrible doom.
</P>
<P>
   Calamities that might seem only squalid at another time of year
take on greater pathos and, we're somehow sure, significance.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Dec. 23, 1899, Willis Clark, an unemployed variety
actor who had lost faith in his prospects, shot at his wife,
missed, and then succeeded in killing himself amid ``holiday crowds
surging past the always busy corner of Fifth Avenue and 23rd
Street, in the continuous kaleidoscopic, cosmopolitan parade.''
</P>
<P>
   Readers could take a guilty, debonair pleasure in the high-life
crime drama of the ``young clubman'' Roland B. Molineux, who was
spending this Christmas in the Tombs while on trial for a Christmas
crime from the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Molineux stood accused of having mailed a present _ a bottle of
Bromo Seltzer with a silver holder _ to one Harry Cornish. Not
knowing that cyanide was mixed into the bottle, Cornish allowed his
landlady to partake of the contents with fatal results.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper audience for the continuing story was not yet
aware of another man spending Christmas 1899 in prison for
embezzlement partway across the country in Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   There, William Sydney Porter, who would become better known as
O. Henry, passed away the time in jail by writing stories. ``The
Gift of the Magi,'' even now the ultimate tale of New York
gift-giving, was only several years off, and knowledge of its
imminence might have eased the disappointment of our ``Christmas
Spirit'' essayist, whose nostalgic complaints included the decline
in those ``simple stories which used to fill the Christmas
numbers'' of the magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The newspapers, then as now, were crammed with advertisements
for after-Christmas bargains. Abraham &AMP; Straus beckoned readers to
its ``Annual Event in Muslin Underwear,'' and the Siegel Cooper
department store, disposing of the Yule as if it were a nuisance,
offered ``a clean sweep of all our Holiday Toys,'' including some
``Handsomely Dressed Dolls'' for 10 cents.
</P>
<P>
   One imagines that avid young newspaper reader Virginia O'Hanlon
awakening on West 95th Street to scan the ads in search of
something to make up for yesterday's letdown. Now 10 _ two years
past The New York Sun's famous letter reassuring her that yes,
there is a Santa Claus, and probably more skeptical about the
matter _ she, too, had surely concluded that Christmas isn't what
it used to be.

 &HT;    WASHINGTON'S MALL-ENNIUM: FIREWORKS, MUSIC AND ANXIETY
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (l) lifestyle categories for
release Sunday, Dec. 26.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Champagne, music, a spectacular fireworks display _
and a touch of anxiety _ will set the tone of the ``America's
Millennium'' celebration on the Washington Mall on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   The White House office of the first lady, which is coordinating
plans for ringing in the first year that starts with a ``2'' _
calendar purists say the next millennium won't start until Jan. 1,
2001 _ was predicting last week that 100,000 people would show up
for the festivities.
</P>
<P>
   That's quite a drop from the 600,000 originally expected.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is likely the result of continuous cautions from
President Clinton and other officials for Americans to be
``vigilant'' about possible terrorist acts during the holiday
season.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the customary ``lost kids'' tent, a new
37-foot-long mobile command center has been stationed on the Mall
for use by police, fire and other emergency officials _ another
reminder of the vague but real concern about Y2K terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, a daylong celebration will climax with a
pyrotechnic extravaganza described by its producer as a
once-in-a-millennium cascade of brilliant white ``stars'' raining
down from the 555-foot Washington Monument.
</P>
<P>
   From the Lincoln Memorial several hundred yards away, Clinton
will light a fuse 20 seconds before midnight to set off the finale.
</P>
<P>
   It will take 10 seconds for the fuse to burn its way to the base
of the Washington Monument, currently surrounded by an elaborate
scaffold because of refurbishing work.
</P>
<P>
   Then, starting at 11:59:50, 10 successive bursts of brilliant
white stars will rain down the sides of the monument, each 55 feet
above the one before it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, beginning at precisely midnight, the entire monument
will be covered with ``a stunningly beautiful waterfall'' of white
pyrotechnics, said Philip Butler, who is producing the show for
Fireworks by Grucci, a venerable Long Island company.
</P>
<P>
   For a period of 20 seconds, all 10 segments of the fireworks
display will burn simultaneously. Then, beginning again at the
bottom, they will start shutting down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The monument is a national icon which is held in great
reverence,'' Butler said in an interview last week, ``and we could
never use it as a fireworks stage, except for the scaffolding being
there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Through a lot of effort on everybody's part, including the
National Park Service, we worked out a way to use the scaffolds and
not the monument itself for our spectacular. This will never be
done again _ unless maybe in the year 3000.''
</P>
<P>
   An ``America's Millennium Gala'' show preceding the fireworks
will be televised by CBS.
</P>
<P>
   But the millennium events are to take up most of the day,
beginning at 11 a.m. with performances on the Mall by youth choirs,
the U.S. Marine Corps Band and other performers. The president and
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton will unveil a ``National
Millennium Time Capsule,'' containing artifacts representing
America at the end of the 20th century, at the 11 a.m. event.
</P>
<P>
   Four Smithsonian Mall museums _ the National Air and Space
Museum, the National Museum of Natural History, the Hirshhorn
Museum and the National Museum of American History _ will operate
at their normal 10 a.m.-5:30 p.m. hours throughout the New Year's
weekend, Dec. 31 through Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, auditoriums in the Hirshhorn and the museums of
American history and national history will present a continuous
series of 33 hour-long lectures on subjects ranging from bluegrass
music to the future of sports in America.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets are free, but have all been given out on a
first-come-first-served basis, a Smithsonian spokesperson said.
</P>
<P>
   Beer, wine and champagne will be sold at the Mall celebration,
but alcohol consumption will be monitored with a wristband
accounting system, and limited to a four-block area east of the
Washington Monument.
</P>
<P>
   Streets immediately around the Mall will be closed, and city
officials have urged persons attending the celebration to use the
Metro subway system. Subways will operate until 3 a.m. and buses
until 4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons will host a dinner for 1,000 invited guests at the
White House. A select 320, including Muhammad Ali and Elizabeth
Taylor, will actually sit down with the first couple inside the
White House. The rest, members of Congress and others, will dine in
a heated tent in the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner, the Clintons and 500 of their guests will go to
the Lincoln Memorial for a splashy ``America's Millennium Gala,''
hosted by actor-rapper Will Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The gala will include entertainment by Robert Duvall, Diane
Keaton, Kathy Mattea, Bobby McFerrin, Don McLean, Brian Stokes
Mitchell, Kenny Rogers, Luther Vandross, Tricia Yearwood, Sam
Waterston, BeBe Winans and Luke Cresswell accompanied by
</P>
<P>
   the 25-member company of the Broadway production ``Stomp.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last half-hour of the year, large projection screens
erected beside the Lincoln Memorial will show an 18-minute movie,
``The Unfinished Journey,'' by Steven Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   The president will speak briefly, then light the fuse.

   WHICH WAY THE WIND BLOWS
</P>
<P>
   D.A. Pennebaker gave a literary feeling to ``Don't Look Back,''
his 1967 documentary about Bob Dylan. ``The songs had a Kerouac
quality,'' he said in an interview the other day. ``They
continually surprised you: always the pig who flew through the
window. He took you into literature, whether he intended it or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, to be released on DVD and in a new tape edition on
Jan. 4, travels along on a three-week concert tour of England in
1965. Heard regularly in Britain on Radio Caroline, a pirate
station, Dylan was in the early throes of fame and about to play
the Royal Albert Hall. ``Take that girl off our car,'' a member of
his entourage cries as the limousine edges into the mob after a
performance.
</P>
<P>
   The mood is playful, sort of. ``You had to take part in their
lives in a way that was natural or they'd throw you out of their
room,'' Pennebaker says in a film-length commentary he shares on
the disk with Bob Neuwirth, Dylan's road manager. The director put
his camera on his shoulder and hung out on the fringes. Biography
didn't matter. ``I liked not getting a lot of facts down,'' he
said. ``Because my sense was that he was making it up all along,
inventing himself before our eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan Baez was also on the tour and is prominent in the film.
Life consists of managers and arrangements, small rooms crowded
with friends and their friends. On the disc the two commentators
are always delighted by what they see, which can be infectious.
``Isn't that Allen Ginsberg?'' Neuwirth asks. Dylan is forever
smoking, writing songs and mischievously sparring with the latest
journalist sent to interview him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here comes The Manchester Guardian, in over its head,''
Pennebaker comments on the disc. No one from the press understands
Dylan's songs. He teases them like children. ``If we didn't not
like you, we could put you on,'' he tells one earnest young
reporter who has made the mistake of suggesting that Dylan wasn't
treating him with respect.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, Pennebaker said in the interview, most of the
resulting articles bore Dylan no grudge. ``He was kind in a
sense,'' he said. ``He always pulled back. In literature there are
writers who can't get enough blood on the floor. But he realized
reporters weren't fair contestants. They were just sent out as part
of a job.''
</P>
<P>
   The disc includes new audio performances of ``It's All Over Now,
Baby Blue,'' ``The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll'' and ``It
Ain't Me, Babe'' and, of course, bits of many other songs. In the
film, a reporter from Time magazine tells Dylan that he is going to
attend a concert. ``It's going to happen fast, and you're not going
to get it,'' the singer tells him.
</P>
<P>
   As a film star Dylan was somewhat puzzled himself. ``He was
trying to see what he looked like to people from a more normal
world,'' Pennebaker said. ``He kind of lost track of the film
because it took so little effort and was like a home movie. He had
no thought about how revealing it would be.''

   NEW RELEASES
</P>
<P>
   MICKEY BLUE EYES
</P>
<P>
   Michael Fugate (Hugh Grant) works hard at getting himself into
proper cultural alignment to marry the daughter (Jeanne
Tripplehorn) of a genial Mafia chieftain (James Caan). An
Englishman with Grant's brittle manner, slight stammer and
practiced helplessness is bound to make an awkward fit with
raucous, wear-it-on-your-sleeve future in-laws who are lovable one
minute and deadly the next. With plenty of suave comic timing,
Grant's Mickey negotiates the gangsterish shoals in, Stephen Holden
wrote in The New York Times, ``a lightweight comedy that has more
than enough laughs to justify its silly, scatterbrained premise.''

   1999. Warner. $107.37; DVD, $24.98. 103 minutes. Closed

<P>
   THE HARMONISTS
</P>
<P>
   In telling the story of the Comedian Harmonists, a German
singing group popular in the days when the Weimar Republic gave way
to Nazi control, a handsome and thought-provoking film raises
questions about how the same people could cherish culture and
embrace barbarity. Full of lively, funny and sentimental song, the
group gains in popularity and earns a trip to New York. But three
of its members are Jewish, and on their return they are forced to
disband in a film that approaches Germany's past with ``a
compelling gravity'' (Lawrence Van Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   1999. Miramax. $75.41. 124 minutes. Closed captioned. German
with English subtitles. R.
</P>
<P>
   DROP DEAD GORGEOUS
</P>
<P>
   About as funny as making fun of maimed characters in
wheelchairs, Michael Patrick Jann's film gives the overworked realm
of beauty pageants a scorched-earth treatment that just may finish
the subject forever. (Fat chance.) At a high school in Minnesota, a
pushy pageant organizer (Kirstie Alley) bullies a ragtag field of
entrants through their paces in preparation for a contest that, if
all goes right, will culminate in the coronation of her nasty
daughter (Denise Richards). For viewers all that's left is to
``wince through what may be a record number of miserably unfunny
jokes'' (Janet Maslin).

captioned. PG-13.
</P>
<P>
   THE RED VIOLIN
</P>
<P>
   The discovery by an unscrupulous New York violin restorer
(Samuel L. Jackson) that an instrument he has been assigned to work
on is a legendary violin made in 1681 sets off a fanciful and gaudy
string of tales. Over three centuries the instrument makes its way
from 17th-century Italy to 18th-century Austria, to a tribe of
Gypsies, then to 19th-century England, 20th-century China and
finally to contemporary Montreal. The fiddle experiences a lot over
that stretch, but the intended grand statement about the mystical
power of great music becomes ``too kitschy to let that vision catch
fire'' (Holden).

FEDERAL RESERVE'S Y2K COMMAND POST WILL WATCH BANKS AND MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Dec. 26)   (EDS: Filed in the ``w'' and ``f'' categories.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although the Federal Reserve Board isn't expecting
any widespread Y2K problems, the Fed will operate a special
around-the-clock command post that will monitor banks and financial
markets for computer glitches beginning Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Board Governors Roger W. Ferguson and Edward W.
Kelley will work over the New Year's weekend, helping 100 staffers
at the command center keep track of each time zone's rollover into
the new year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't expecting major problems,'' said Federal Reserve
spokeswoman Rose Pianalto. The financial markets and the banking
industry _ particularly in the United States and major
industrialized countries_ started addressing the Y2K problem early.
As a result, American bankers predict their computers will work
without a hitch on Jan. 1 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K computer problem is the result of old programming that
expressed years with two digits, meaning that uncorrected computers
could interpret ``00'' as ``1900'' and crash, or garble data,
potentially disrupting everything from air travel to
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's main focus will be to ensure that the U.S. banking
system survives the transition into the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed, which regulates about 1,500 U.S. banks, is requiring
the largest of them to do a ``health check'' on Saturday, Jan. 1 _
a day when most banks are traditionally closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will check the lights, the heat and the computers and
report to us,'' Pianalto said. The banks will report to one of the
Fed's 12 regional banks that are also running 24-hour Y2K centers.
The regional Fed banks will report into the Fed's headquarters in
Washington. That information, in turn, will be passed along to the
White House's Y2K command center.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed will also make sure that the nation's money system _ an
electronic network that moves money _ is working. The system helps
keep ATMs running and ensures that payments like paychecks are
correctly transferred from an employer's account to individual
employee accounts at various banks.
</P>
<P>
   Fed officials and bankers were once concerned that people would
withdraw huge sums of money and even close their accounts before
the New Year because of fears that their banks would be paralyzed
by Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   However, fear of an Y2K-inspired run on the banks was apparently
unfounded. Pianalto said bank customers appear to have taken out
more cash in anticipation of the New Year, but not enough to case
alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, there was $530 billion in circulation, up 14 percent
over last November's figure of $464 billion, according to the Fed.
The amount of cash in circulation in November and December
typically increases by 7 percent annually, partly to accommodate
holiday spending, giving rise to the likelihood that only the other
7 percent hike represents withdrawals by customers concerned about
Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great economy,'' Pianalto said, explaining that part of
the increased cash can be attributed to strong holiday retail
sales. ``But some of it is probably Y2K.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's Y2K post is set up in the Federal Reserve's dining
room on the top floor of its five-story building on Constitution
Avenue and offers spectacular views of the Washington Monument and
the Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials.
</P>
<P>
   But other than the view, the center looks like dozens of other
government Y2K command centers sprinkled throughout the Washington
area. It is outfitted with about 100 computers that sit on small
desks with only enough room for the computer monitor and a phone.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed rented several televisions to follow Y2K news. Rented
clocks are set to local time in Hong Kong, London, Moscow, New York
and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand will be the first major country to enter into the
New Year at 6 a.m. Dec. 31. EST.
</P>
<P>
   The busiest day for the Fed will likely come on Monday, Jan. 3,
when banks and many world markets open for business. All U.S.
markets will be open then, though some markets in Japan and London
will be closed in observance of the New Year's holiday.
</P>
<P>
   During the early morning hours on Monday the Fed will check
markets in Hong Kong, Frankfurt, Germany and Paris to see how they
are doing. During the day on Monday, the 12 regional Fed banks will
call each private bank in their respective regions, again to see if
the lights, heat and computers are working. Banks are also required
to report any unusual behavior such as massive withdrawals of
funds.

   QUESTION: Where can I find the Eternity Puzzle, which is popular
in Europe and has supposedly been available in the United States
since October?
</P>
<P>
   _ J.H., Worcester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ANSWER: Eternity, a 209-piece jigsaw puzzle that will pay 1
million British pounds to the person who solves it first, is
available by mail from the Evers Toy Store. The prize is worth more
than $1.6 million at present exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   The puzzle sells for $29.95 plus $6 shipping and handling. To
order, call (800) 962-9481; write to Evers Toy Store, Box 241,
Dyersville, IA 52040; or visit the Web site www.everstoystore.com.
</P>
<P>
   All puzzle pieces are the same color on both sides, no two are
identical in shape, and there's no way to distinguish an edge
piece. They must be placed onto a 12-sided board with no gaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite common to fill most of the board, only to discover
that the last 20 or so pieces just cannot be placed,'' Eternity
enthusiast Mark Pursey writes on his Web site at
homepages.tig.com.au/~snark/eternity.
</P>
<P>
   You also can win the money without purchasing the puzzle. For
rules, write to Eternity, Ertl/Racing Champions, Box 500,

Combs, 518 Union St., Nashville, TN 37219-1750.
</P>
<P>
   Urich, who turned 53 on Dec. 19, said a year ago that he has a
clean bill of health. Chemotherapy and radiation treatments were
used to fight the rare soft-tissue cancer he was found to have in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz, 77, was found to have cancer in November. He will be
retiring from his ``Peanuts'' comic strip early next year, ending
new daily strips Jan. 3 and Sunday strips on Feb. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Varney, 50, recently made public his illness. He had part of his
right lung removed in September 1998 and has had radiation
treatments.

   The busiest day for the Fed will likely come on Monday, Jan. 3,
when banks and many world markets open for business. All U.S.
markets will be open then, though some markets in Japan and London
will be closed in observance of the New Year's holiday.
</P>
<P>
   During the early morning hours on Monday the Fed will check
markets in Hong Kong, Frankfurt, Germany and Paris to see how they
are doing. During the day on Monday, the 12 regional Fed banks will
call each private bank in their respective regions, again to see if
the lights, heat and computers are working. Banks are also required
to report any unusual behavior such as massive withdrawals of
funds.

`IRVING BERLIN': A SMARTLY PRODUCED BIOGRAPHY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review. Time is for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(lh) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The silence at the center of ``Irving Berlin: An American Song''
is the program's subject himself. Berlin utters scarcely a word in
Sunday's two-hour tribute on A&AMP;E to his prodigious career. When we
hear directly from him, it is his famous rendition of ``Oh! How I
Hate to Get Up in the Morning,'' from ``This Is the Army.'' His
reticence offstage can be taken as his way of telling the world
that what he had to say he said in his music and lyrics, and that
there was nothing he could add to that, so why bother?
</P>
<P>
   This smartly produced and edited biography makes a good case
that the sentimentality, the patriotism, the connection to his
country and his audience that we hear in Berlin's songs were real.
In work that some critics, favoring the spirit of a Porter or a
Hart or a Sondheim, dismissed as unsophisticated, an enormous
audience found an expression of its own feelings, whether for
America or Christmas or true love. Berlin was a show-business
natural, but his songs were from the heart.
</P>
<P>
   When he tapped into his audience, he was tapping into himself.
``Always'' was for Ellin Mackay, the love of his life; ``Blue
Skies'' was for their first baby. It didn't matter that he couldn't
read music; the magic was in how he heard it and brought it to
life.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the immigrant boy who became America's best-loved
composer began on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in the early
years of the century. After his inauspicious start as a singing
waiter (32 cents in royalties for his first song, ``Marie From
Sunny Italy,'' which rhymed ``queen'' with ``mand-o-leen''),
``Alexander's Ragtime Band'' swept the nation, and except for the
rare lapse he kept turning out hits for half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin's career ended in the 1950s with the advent of rock 'n'
roll. For all his versatility through the decades, the new pop
music did not come naturally to him, and after a couple of failed
efforts he withdrew from show business. He lived on to 1989, but
with bouts of depression. The program doesn't get very deeply into
the reclusive man, but it does justice to the tunes.
</P>
<P>
   It's still easy to get caught up in Berlin's songs and their
spirit, whether it's a scratchy version of ``A Pretty Girl Is Like
a Melody'' from the Ziegfeld Follies, or Fred Astaire doing ``Cheek
to Cheek'' with Ginger Rogers, or Judy Garland in the Easter
Parade, or Rudy Vallee introducing a radio audience to ``Say It
Isn't So,'' or Ethel Waters having a heat wave, or Bing Crosby
crooning ``White Christmas,'' or Kate Smith rousing the nation with
``God Bless America,'' or Ethel Merman doin' what comes natur'lly.
Berlin stopped writing a half-century ago, but the snatches heard
here of his astounding array of hits can start you humming all over
again.

 &HT;    Face of Jesus a 2,000-year-old mystery
 &HT;    (Eds: The following package on the facts behind Jesus and his
story has moved through the week and is moving again for today. The
package includes JESUS-LIFE, JESUS-APPEARANCE, JESUS-CRUCIFY,

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Jesus Christ is worshiped as the human
incarnation of the son of God, and his likeness has been reproduced
for hundreds of years by thousands of artists.
</P>
<P>
   But they've all been making it up.
</P>
<P>
   The Apostles were assiduous in copying down Jesus' message, but
no one bothered to write about his appearance. We know some things
he said, but not at all how he sounded.
</P>
<P>
   And though Bible readers are given vague hints about the visage
of the Prince of Peace, even those are contradictory. It was
written that Jesus was handsome, and it was written that he was
not.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries European Renaissance painters gave him the benefit
of the doubt. Jesus was portrayed as tall and fair and, well,
angelic, but archeologists and historians say the evidence points
otherwise. By the standards of white America today, the son of God
was probably short, dark and lithe. ``He was probably about
5-feet-4, and 135 pounds with tanned olive skin,'' said the Rev J.
Brabban, chairman of the religion and philosophy department at Palm
Beach Atlantic College in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Since Jesus was a carpenter and a construction worker he
probably had calluses on his hands. In all likelihood he had brown
or black hair, perhaps curly, and an aquiline, Semitic nose. In
short, Jesus looked like a Middle Eastern Jew who worked hard for a
living.
</P>
<P>
   But did he have a beard and long hair like he did on Broadway in
``Jesus Christ Superstar?'' Maybe. Men of that day wore their hair
both long and short, but most of the styles archeologists are
familiar with from the first century come from portraits of rich
people who lived in big cities, hardly a category Jesus fell into.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tradition of Jesus having long hair and a beard is from
the Middle Ages,'' said Michael White, a professor of religious
studies at the University of Texas at Austin. ``They romanticized
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``People make things up and then they get passed down as fact.
It's like the camels in the story of the Magi. There is no evidence
that there were camels and they were not typical domestic animals,
but everybody thinks they were there because that's how the story
is presented.''
</P>
<P>
   What historians are confident of is that Jesus was probably
familiar with four languages. His native tongue would have been
Aramaic, a cousin to Hebrew; the language spoken at the marketplace
was Greek; the formal language of the government was Latin. Jesus
would have both read and written ancient Hebrew, the language of
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   By our standards, Jesus would have been considered, materially
at least, dirt poor. He might have eaten meat _ lamb or goat _ once
every two weeks but he survived largely on grains. Except for the
time he spent near the Sea of Galilee, all the fish he ate was
probably salted.
</P>
<P>
   And he was not well-traveled. With the exception of his family's
exile to Egypt after his birth, he probably never ventured more
than 100 miles away from his hometown of Nazareth. But because he
lived in the Middle East, the crossroads of the world, he probably
saw people from several different countries who came through the
Holy Land to trade their merchandise, and their slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Besides persecution, he probably feared leprosy and knew a few
people with tuberculosis. Since even rudimentary dental care or
optometry was still centuries away, most of the people around him
were missing teeth and suffered from poor vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's all speculation,'' said White. ``From all we know he
looked like any ordinary Jewish person of the first century. But we
can't really be sure.''

 &HT;    Jesus' death quick by Roman standards
 &HT;    (Eds: The following package on the facts behind Jesus and his
story has moved through the week and is moving again for today. The
package includes JESUS-LIFE, JESUS-APPEARANCE, JESUS-CRUCIFY,
JESUS-MISTLETOE and JESUS-GIFTS.)

<P>
   The spikes nailed through Jesus' wrists and ankles did not kill
him. The crown of thorns that cut into his brow was little more
than a nuisance, and the whipping he endured before he was
crucified was almost an act of mercy.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Christ, like the tens of thousands who were crucified
before and after him, died because he could not breathe.
</P>
<P>
   By hanging someone by their arms, a crucifix forced a victim's
diaphragm to lift the weight of their torso and lower body in order
to raise the abdominal wall and give the lungs room to expand. With
the added weight, that diaphragm slowly exhausts. When it can no
longer expand, the lungs have no room to inflate. Jesus was able to
take in less and less air until he suffocated.
</P>
<P>
   As sadistic as the physics of a basic crucifixion sound, the
Romans had engineered methods to make it worse. By placing a small
hump on the vertical post of the crucifix at the small of the
victim's back, the condemned could save himself, for awhile, by
raising himself onto the hump and taking some weight off his
diaphragm. Eventually, his arms would exhaust and he would sink
back down and start the process of suffocation again.
</P>
<P>
   Christ didn't have this opportunity, and in some small way the
Romans were merciful to him. The nails they pounded through his
ankles would have made it impossible for him to raise himself, and
the whipping, the crown of thorns and the spikes through his wrists
_ pounded not through the delicate tissue of the hands, but between
the sturdier bones that run between the elbow and wrist _ would
also bleed every time he shifted his weight. Taken together, all
these things would have weakened him further and hastened his
death.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it could have been worse. By the time Christ was hung on
the cross, the Romans had plenty of practice honing the science of
crucifixion. They had inherited the method from the Persians, who
had pioneered it about 500 years earlier, according to the Rev. J.
Brabban, chairman of the religion and philosophy department at Palm
Beach Atlantic College in West Palm Beach, Fla. But instead of a
cross, the Persians lashed the wrists and ankles of the condemned
to the four corners of a device that looked like the letter X.
</P>
<P>
   The Romans raised the crucifix onto a post a few feet above the
ground to better expose the condemned. The point, after all, was
not just to execute, but to torture and to set an example for
others who were considering breaking the law.
</P>
<P>
   It was, no doubt, effective. It could take almost a week to die.
But in Jesus' case, ``it was probably over in six hours,'' said
Brabban.
</P>
<P>
   Crucifixion continued as a form of execution through the fourth
century, Brabban said. But by then, with Christianity spreading, it
stopped being used because anyone crucified would appear
Christlike. And the point of an execution, after all, is to kill
people, not to martyr them.

 &HT;    Frankincense and myrrh were like gold in their time
 &HT;    (Eds: The following package on the facts behind Jesus and his
story has moved through the week and is moving again for today. The
package includes JESUS-LIFE, JESUS-APPEARANCE, JESUS-CRUCIFY,
JESUS-MISTLETOE and JESUS-GIFTS.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   It takes a little of the magic away from the Magi to be able to
buy frankincense and myrrh for $2.95 in the incense department at
just about any New Age bookstore. But in their day, the Three Wise
Men had a different set of circumstances with which to deal.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, frankincense and myrrh _ not to mention gold _ were
among the most precious commodities in the world. The resins were
collected from trees in Arabia and Africa and carried over land for
hundreds of miles to reach the Middle East. Merchants had to deal
with bandits and, during the Roman empire, very high taxes to get
them to market.
</P>
<P>
   But the trade flourished for more than 2,000 years because the
resins drew fantastically high prices, largely because of the
powers they were said to possess. Frankincense was associated with
divinity and myrrh with suffering. When inhaled, they could help
men get in touch with the divine.
</P>
<P>
   Both scents were used during religious rituals, but they were
also prized as perfumes for courtship. At times they were banned
from non-religious use.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptians would burn frankincense and use the charcoal to
make their black eyeliner. And frankincense was found in the tomb
of Tutankhamen. Queen Sheba and King Solomon both used it and it
was even exported to China during the Ming Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   Myrrh, which was often burnt along with frankincense, was used
in the embalming process of the ancient Egyptians. The crude resin
was typically placed inside the hollowed-out body cavity of the
dead.
</P>
<P>
   To harvest frankincense and myrrh, collectors cut the tree
trunks from which they came. From the cuts, resin drips out and
dries under the sun into hard, knobby masses called tears. The oils
from the resins are distilled by steaming the tears.
</P>
<P>
   Today, frankincense and myrrh are used in aromatherapy.
According to promotional literature, the scents can ``evoke
emotional balance in cases of anxiety or stress and are best used
when seeking emotional insight. ... The curling tendrils of burning
frankincense and myrrh have measured the passage of history, and
facilitate the navigation of inner and outer spiritual realms.''
Might make a nice present ...

 &HT;    Nazareth of Jesus' time was primitive, perilous

   Jesus may have been the Prince of Peace, but if his life was at
all typical of his fellow Nazarenes in the first century, he didn't
live like royalty while he was growing up.
</P>
<P>
   As a young man, he would have lived under the same roof with a
few goats and, maybe, a cow and a couple of sheep. He would have
shared his bedroom with several members of his extended family. And
in the middle of the night, in winter, he probably used the same
chamber pot as the rest of the family.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in first-century Galilee meant working around the
house from the time you were 4 or 5, grinding flour from wheat
grown on your own land and collecting animal dung to burn in the
family fire. It meant bathing weekly and rubbing yourself with
lemon rinds as a deodorant. It meant keeping an eye out for wild
boars when traveling and probably knowing a few people who had been
gored to death.
</P>
<P>
   It meant lugging water from central cisterns shared by everyone
in the community. It meant that if you broke your leg as a child,
you'd probably walk with a limp for the rest of your life.
</P>
<P>
   And according to Eric Meyers, a professor of Judaic studies at
Duke University who has worked on digs around Nazareth for 20
years, it might have meant commuting to work.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Jesus was born, Nazareth was rapidly becoming the
bedroom community of Sepphoris, which Herod Antipas _ the Jewish
ruler of Galilee _ declared his capital about the time Jesus was
born. That declaration set off a building boom that continued
throughout Jesus' life.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus and Joseph, along with dozens of other local craftsmen,
probably walked the three miles to Sepphoris to help construct the
homes, many for the wealthy, as well as public theaters and
government centers that were being erected.
</P>
<P>
   While Nazareth had a population of a few hundred and was more of
a hamlet than a town, Sepphoris was probably home to about 15,000
by the middle of the first century, Meyers said. In the last 20
years, archeologists have discovered a theater and about 50
mikvahs, or Jewish ritual baths.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very religious community,'' Meyers said. ``Nazareth
was poor to middle class, but Sepphoris would have been a lot
wealthier, maybe middle class to upper class, with a lot more going
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Artisans from out of town who were trained in working with
stucco or masonry would likely have lived in Sepphoris to take
advantage of the building boom. And since the city was at the
intersection of several trade routes, foreigners likely passed
through regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Sepphoris eventually grew into a major city and learning center:
The Mishnah, a well-known collection of Jewish laws, was edited
there in the third century. By the eighth century, the city was
taken over by Muslims. And in the 12th century, a decisive battle
that sent the Christians packing and ended the last of the Crusades
took place a few miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The city was taken over by Israel in 1948 and today is a
national park and one of the most popular tourist sites in Israel.
A replica of a first-century household in Nazareth is under
construction and may open this summer, Meyers said.

 &HT;    Folk tale says mistletoe, once a full-fledged tree, was used for
Christ's cross
 &HT;    (Eds: The following package on the facts behind Jesus and his
story has moved through the week and is moving again for today. The
package includes JESUS-LIFE, JESUS-APPEARANCE, JESUS-CRUCIFY,
JESUS-MISTLETOE and JESUS-GIFTS.)

<P>
   The mistletoe you're trying to get caught under this Christmas
season wasn't always the semi-parasitic plant it is today.
According to an old French folk story, mistletoe used to be a tree
in its own right until it was caught in the wrong place at the
wrong time.
</P>
<P>
   The French folk tale has it that mistletoe was used to make
Christ's cross, and thereafter it was cursed and forced to become a
parasite in order to survive.
</P>
<P>
   That's just one of the myriad myths that surround this storied
plant. All heal, Birdlime, Devil's Fuge, Golden Bough, Holy wood,
Witches' Broom, Wood of the Cross _ they're all names for
mistletoe, or Phoradendron serotinum, if you prefer the Latin.
</P>
<P>
   Norse mythology has it that mistletoe became associated with
love when an arrow made from its branches was used to kill Balder,
the Norse god of peace.
</P>
<P>
   Balder, the son of Odin and Frigga, had a premonition that he
would die. When he told the other gods about his fears, Frigga, the
goddess of love, exacted an oath from fire, water, metals, stones,
trees, diseases and even poisons not to do any harm to Balder.
</P>
<P>
   The other gods _ being gods _ heard about this pact and began to
slash at Balder with their swords as a tribute to his
imperviousness. Then they fired arrows at him only to watch them
bounce harmlessly away.
</P>
<P>
   But Balder's enemy, Loki, found out from Frigga that she had not
exacted an oath from one plant: mistletoe. She considered the plant
too feeble to hurt Balder.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing this, Loki tricked a blind man into shooting an arrow of
mistletoe at the god of peace. The arrow struck Balder in the heart
and killed him. His death saddened the rest of the gods so greatly
that they restored Balder's life. The plant was then given to
Frigga who dedicated it as a symbol of peace between enemies and
love between friends.
</P>
<P>
   Frigga, legend has it, decreed that anyone passing beneath a
sprig of mistletoe must seal that love with a kiss.

 &HT;    10 Christian artists who made a difference in the '90s
 &HT;    By James Lloyd
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The '90s brought unprecedented growth in
contemporary Christian music, with more artists than ever finding
mainstream success.
</P>
<P>
   Consider some of the names: Amy Grant, Kirk Franklin, BeBe and
CeCe Winans, Michael W. Smith, Jars of Clay, Sixpence None the
Richer. Thanks to a sentimental song he wrote for his daughter's
high-school graduation, Bob Carlisle became the first contemporary
Christian artist to hit No. 1 with an album, ``Butterfly Kisses
(Shades of Grace).''
</P>
<P>
   According to SoundScan Inc. figures reported by the Gospel Music
Association in July, sales of Christian music the first six months
of 1999 showed a 21 percent increase over 1998. SoundScan numbers
place Christian music fifth in size in '98, with 6.8 percent of the
market, behind R&AMP;B, rap, country and soundtracks and bigger than
metal, jazz, classical, Latin and new age.
</P>
<P>
   As the decade winds down, it seems the right time to look at
some of the personalities who helped stimulate the growth.
</P>
<P>
   When you choose any top 10, you set yourself up for second
guessing. (How dare you leave out Lawrence Welk from the best TV
hosts of the 20th century?) But in the spirit of VH1's ``The
List,'' we will press on, offering three criteria:
</P>
<P>
   _ Each had to be someone you might have heard about, so the
movers and shakers who stayed behind the scenes were mostly
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   _ It's not only influence, but how you use it. Sales of records
couldn't be enough. Artists had to have something else to earn the
title ``influential.''
</P>
<P>
   _ They still had to be having an impact on music at the end of
the decade.
</P>
<P>
   1. dc Talk: Toby McKeehan, Kevin Max and Michael Tait have
changed the face of Christian music, while growing musically and
constantly broadening their fan base. Recently specializing in
densely layered melodies that lyrically address issues where faith
confronts lifestyle, dc Talk's existence as a group _ two whites
and an African-American, sharing equal billing _ spoke volumes in
their early days as a rap group in the late '80s, when contemporary
Christian music tended to be pretty white and bland. They have
taken the push for racial equality into their lyrics _ ``Colored
People'' was a Beatlesque plea for harmony and one of the
most-played songs of the late '90s. It doesn't hurt that Max and
Tait have two of the best voices in any genre. dc Talk may not have
the highest sales in the decade, but these Jesus freaks, probably
more than anyone else, made it possible for eclectic voices to be
heard.
</P>
<P>
   2. Michael W. Smith: This blue-eyed dynamo turned out four gold
and one platinum album in the '90s, and his November release,
``This Is Your Time,'' sold more than 120,000 units in its first
week _ a record for contemporary Christian music. But Smith also
penned music for a bunch of other projects, this year becoming the
first Christian artist to receive the ASCAP Golden Note Award for
lifetime achievement in songwriting. He also began his own record
company, Rocketown, that seeks to re-create the early familylike
Christian music atmosphere for singer/songwriters. The first artist
signed, Chris Rice, already has had two hit albums and remains
committed to his own youth ministry. Still, this year's Gospel
Music Association's artist of the year seems very rooted as a
husband, father and friend. Kids retain a special place in his
heart. In Dayton early this month for the Amy Grant Christmas
concert, he met with pastors, youth workers and Christian music
promoters to discuss his Rocketown outreach, which, according to
its mission statement, seeks to meet ``the social, spiritual and
physical needs of disenfranchised adolescents.''
</P>
<P>
   3. Kirk Franklin: Whether it's with the Family, God's Property
or ``The Nu Nation Project,'' this diminutive man stomps the
competition and breaks down barriers every time he releases a CD.
With a past that shows he understands the temptations an urban kid
undergoes _ abandoned by his teen-age mother and raised by an aunt
_ he's become, according to no less an authority than Rolling Stone
(on its Web site, www.rollingstone.com), ``the most popular gospel
singer of the 1990s, responsible for selling millions of albums
through his talent and charisma, while almost single-handedly
bringing inspirational African-American music to the masses.'' One
way he's done that is to invite guest artists, from energetic kids
to Bono to Mary J. Blige to Crystal Lewis, to join him. Only about
30, he's shown himself to be someone worth leaning on.
</P>
<P>
   4. Amy Grant: What is it about Amy Grant that has kept her in
the limelight for more than two decades? It's not her musical
ability, though her voice is as easy to take as her beauty. Nor is
it her songwriting, which is often underrated. Her '91 release,
``Heart in Motion,'' went five times platinum, thanks to the first
monster crossover hit of the decade, ``Baby Baby,'' about her
daughter Millie. Perhaps her main appeal is her humanity and her
ability to both receive grace and extend it to others. On a good
night on stage, she seems to make eye contact with every person in
the room, to make each feel important. The vulnerability shown on
'97's ``Behind the Eyes'' was courageously uncommon in Christian
music, and it was almost painful to listen to. Even after her
well-publicized divorce from singer/songwriter Gary Chapman, many
remain fiercely protective of Grant, an uncommon occurrence in the
Christian music community.
</P>
<P>
   5. Steven Curtis Chapman: SCC may well be the artist of the
decade in Christian music. With 39, he has practically owned the
Gospel Music Association's Dove Awards, being recognized by his
contemporaries virtually every time he sneezes. According to the
Dec. 20 CCM Update trade publication, Chapman finished with 11 of
the top 100 songs on the end-of-decade Christian adult contemporary
airplay chart, including No. 1, 1992's ``The Great Adventure.'' He
also scored the top two on the '99 AC airplay chart with ``Dive''
and ``Speechless.'' He's a singer/songwriter with a knack for
finding the perfect hook and for writing songs the Christian
community can identify with. He makes it seem so simple, he may be
sold short. Only in his 30s, Chapman is unlikely to go out quietly
for some time.
</P>
<P>
   6. Steve Taylor: Sometimes called ``the clown prince of
Christian music,'' this tall, lanky dude knows how to offend
Christian ``clones'' as well as spark laughs. But hardly anybody
can argue with the results of his Squint label, which he started a
couple of years ago in connection with the Word Music Group. His
label specializes in those groups that don't easily fit the
Christian music stereotype. But it's the success of Sixpence None
the Richer, named Breakthrough Group of 1999 by R&AMP;R magazine, that
shows Taylor's ability to identify artists that can be marketed far
and wide. Thanks to a little love song called ``Kiss Me,''
Billboard's No. 6 pop song of the year, in coming months you'll see
lead singer Leigh Nash's mug all over TV and magazines, which, come
to think of it, is preferable to seeing Taylor's.
</P>
<P>
   7. Point of Grace: This group has had unprecedented success
since its self-titled 1995 debut release. With at least 20
consecutive No. 1 radio singles, gold and platinum albums and three
books, the four women of Point of Grace began perfecting their
airtight harmonies and easy-listening sound in 1991 while on an
Arkansas college campus. They have all married now and started
having kids, but their music continues to encourage people to stay
the spiritual course. They also helped take the message that
abstinence is an option to thousands of teen-age girls early on.
Though some in the mainstream laughed, look how the movement has
caught on. Girl power? Oh, yeah.
</P>
<P>
   8. Rich Mullins: Like Keith Green and Mark Heard before him,
this Ragamuffin left this world much too soon, dying in an
automobile accident in September 1997. Like Green and Heard, he
made no attempt to hide his discomfort with the modern Church's
focus on self-indulgence. He left Nashville, Tenn., eventually
settling on a Navajo reservation to teach reading. Mullins had an
understanding of God's grace only a forgiven sinner could gain, and
that the same man who could worship an ``Awesome God'' could also
accuse God of playing ``Hard to Get'' is what drew troubled souls
to him _ and through him to Christ. His best work, ``The Jesus
Record,'' was released posthumously, and completing that project
birthed A Raggamuffin Band, which releases its first CD without
him, ``Prayers of a Ragamuffin,'' Tuesday. The group seems
determined to carry on his mission and his message.
</P>
<P>
   9. Jars of Clay: Nobody could have predicted the flood of
publicity that would attend the unexpected mainstream success of
the group's single, ``Flood,'' off its '95 debut project. dc Talk
may have paved the way for other rock and hip-hop groups, but Jars
opened a modern-rock superhighway. With unprecedented access to a
young audience and with a message that may have seemed alien to it,
Jars of Clay handled the pressure without cracking. The band's
third effort, ``If I Left the Zoo,'' recently released to critical
acclaim. If the dc boys go their separate ways early in the new
millennium, as is widely expected, Jars of Clay are the heirs
apparent to the male-group throne in Christian music.
</P>
<P>
   10. CeCe Winans: The voice would be enough. But besides
communicating heaven every time she opens her mouth, Winans has
been an influential good friend to the likes of Whitney Houston,
and she's started her own label, Wellspring Gospel, for artists _
like her _ who don't fit easily into a marketing niche (R&AMP;B, pop,
rock). According to an interview in this month's CCM magazine, she
also wants to use the label as a platform for positive urban music
for young people. BeBe's sister may just be getting started.

`GALAXY QUEST': ONE MORE FINAL FRONTIER _ FIGHTING BAD ALIENS, FOR
REAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review) 
(bl) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether you love ``Star Trek'' or laugh at it, your starship is
about to come in, docking in the form of ``Galaxy Quest,'' an
amiable comedy that simultaneously manages to spoof these popular
futuristic space adventures and replicate the very elements that
have made them so durable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Galaxy Quest,'' opening Saturday, spins out of a single joke,
about a bunch of washed-up actors from a canceled television series
who are enlisted by some credulous interplanetary simpletons to
champion them in conflict with a scaly, bellicose villain who has
all but exterminated their people. If ``Galaxy Quest'' never
attains consistently giddy heights as it plays out its combination
of knowing satire and heroic adventure, it nevertheless keeps its
tongue firmly in its cheek, offers a few genuine laughs, moves
swiftly, if not at warp speed, and is led by a talented cast.
</P>
<P>
   The crew includes Tim Allen as the egotistical Jason Nesmith. To
his legions of fans, he is Cmdr. Peter Quincy Taggart, of the
immortal line ``Never give up; never surrender.'' Sigourney Weaver,
no stranger to combat with slimy space aliens, plays Gwen DeMarco,
known to her fans as Lt. Tawny Madison, the voluptuous
communications officer aboard Taggart's ship, Protector. And Alan
Rickman is Alexander Dane, who sadly remembers that he once
portrayed Richard III in the days before he signed on to become the
Spock-like humanoid Dr. Lazarus.
</P>
<P>
   These actors and Tony Shalhoub as Fred Kwan, alias Tech Sgt.
Chen, and Daryl Mitchell as Tommy Webber, the navigator Lt. Laredo,
have been reduced to signing autographs at fan shows for $15 a pop
and snipping ribbons at supermarket openings when fate (directed by
Dean Parisot from a script by David Howard and Robert Gordon)
intervenes.
</P>
<P>
   In a scene that skewers the ubiquitous ``Star Trek'' fan
conventions, as the testy, disheartened crew copes with costumed
cultists, minutiae-obsessed teen-agers and giggling groupies,
Nesmith-Taggart is approached by a group of odd creatures he
assumes are fans. He dismisses their monotonous babble.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, after he wakes up on the floor at home, hung over
after a night of solitary drinking, they whisk him off to what he
thinks is another re-enactment: a negotiation as Taggart with the
evil Sarris (Robin Sachs) on behalf of the gentle Thermians. But
when Nesmith-Taggart is miraculously returned, he realizes that he
has been aboard a genuine spaceship.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that the Thermians, led by Mathesar (Enrico Colantoni),
believe the courage- and principle-filled ``Galaxy Quest''
television episodes they have witnessed to be actual historical
documents and have sought out Taggart to lead them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alexander,'' Taggart tells the once and future Dr. Lazarus
after he rises to the challenge and enlists his old crew, ``this is
the role of a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   So off they go, joined _ in one of the film's best comic
conceptions _ by Guy Fleegman (Sam Rockwell), now a convention
organizer but once an obscure bit player who died a quick death in
episode 81.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the adventure, as the heroes do battle with Sarris
and his minions, encounter cannibalistic space creatures who
resemble children, face off against assorted monsters and other
perils while standing between the Thermians and extinction,
Fleegman remains convinced that being an unknown actor, he is fated
by the laws of scriptwriting to perish once more.
</P>
<P>
   In the parched comic landscape that now stretches over much of
planet Earth, ``Galaxy Quest'' may not be a monument to the genre,
but it offers a ray of hope for the future.
</P>

 &HT;    BETHLEHEM MIXES CHRISTMAS SPIRIT AND POLITICAL ASPIRATIONS
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHLEHEM _ Almost 2000 years later, people in the city where
Christ was born are hoping for a lot more than just a Merry
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Bethlehem is not a ``little town'' any more. It's a crowded
Palestinian city trying to rebuild after decades of neglect and
Israeli occupation. Christmas and the millennial year 2000 are
opportunities for Bethlehem to emerge anew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, one-third of the world is looking toward Bethlehem. The
burden is very heavy but we are prepared,'' Bethlehem Mayor Hanna
Nasser said recently. ``We know very well this is a religious
occasion, but we should never forget that it has more than one
dimension.''
</P>
<P>
   The other dimensions, he stressed, are ``political, tourism and
development.''
</P>
<P>
   This week around Manger Square, the plaza in front of the Church
of the Nativity, work was going full speed on all three fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Workers polished the tile road markers on Star Street, where new
stone walkways, sewage systems and electrical wiring are still
being completed between the crowded homes.
</P>
<P>
   Shopkeepers opened the doors on new stores along an area _ long
ignored by visitors _ remade into a ``Christmas Market.''
</P>
<P>
   And across the base of the large stage where choirs will sing on
Christmas Eve, Arabic letters make the political point: ``From
Bethlehem 2000 to the independence and building of the Palestinian
state, with its capital of holy Jerusalem and under the leadership
of President Yasser Arafat.''
</P>
<P>
   Raja Zacharia, 38, recently converted his grocery store to a
shop for the olive wood Christmas ornaments he makes. A Roman
Catholic, his father was killed by Israeli shelling in the 1967
Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need peace here in the land of peace,'' Zacharia said,
adding that he is skeptical that the city will never find
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The city, just five miles south of Jerusalem, was under British
and then Jordanian control until Israel captured it in 1967. The
following years saw it beset by tens of thousands of Palestinian
refugees. Road work, sewers and water systems were overloaded.
</P>
<P>
   The town joined the rest of the West Bank during the Palestinian
Intifada uprising of the late 1980s, and was for years the scene of
stone throwing, rubber bullets and tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Israel transferred control of the city to the
Palestinian Authority, run by Arafat. Still bracketed by Israeli
roadblocks, Bethlehem is one of more than 100 sectors of the West
Bank that have been turned over. But, the Palestinians' dream _ of
their own state with a capital in Israeli-controlled Jerusalem _ is
still subject to the hard haggling of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Bethlehem has a population of about 50,000 and is the center of
a district with about 150,000. With the influx of mostly Muslim
refugees, the Christian majority in the city has fallen to a
30-percent minority. Many Christians say they feel pushed aside by
the Muslims when it comes to jobs and other levers of power. Neon
crosses atop some homes and businesses are seen by some as an
assertion of their faith.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser, however, the mayor appointed by Arafat, is a Christian
and Christianity is acknowledged as the city's claim to fame.
</P>
<P>
   Each Christmas eve is marked by a Manger Square block party,
culminating with the midnight mass in the church. This year more
than 60,000 are expected there and more than 900 journalists have
credentials to attend.
</P>
<P>
   With foreign donations of more than $86 million, overseen by the
Palestinian Authority agency called Bethlehem 2000, Manger Square
has been converted from a noisy bus parking lot to a tree-lined
piazza.
</P>
<P>
   A museum and cultural center was built in place of a former
British and Israeli prison on the square. A five-star
Inter-Continental Hotel is being built around a former sultan's
palace on the edge of downtown. It will overlook the block houses
and dirt streets of a refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   City officials hope to shave off a greater percentage of the
tourist money spent by pilgrims coming from Israel next door. Signs
in the Christmas market proclaim, ``Come do your Christmas shopping
in the real capital of Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, a Muslim, has been an enthusiastic booster of the year
2000 effort, in contrast to his subdued Israeli rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinians have put the Israelis in the shade,'' said
Israeli Rabbi David Rosen, Israel director of the Anti-Defamation
League. He faults Israelis for late millennium preparation and says
they might miss a chance to improve relations between Jews and
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   In Bethlehem, residents see it as an opportunity they cannot
afford to miss.
</P>
<P>
   If the year 2000 is a success, Mayor Nasser said, people around
the world will ``consider Bethlehem as a spiritual capital and not
think of Bethlehem only on the 24th and 25th days of December.''

   RUSSIA-TALBOTT (Moscow) _ As Russian forces continue to pound
rebel positions in the breakaway region of Chechnya on Thursday,
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott accused Russia of
violating ``international norms'' by treating civilians as
``terrorists.'' Stepping up U.S. criticism of Russia's three-month
war, Talbott wound up two days of meetings with top officials in
Moscow by saying that ``substantial differences, even
disagreements'' remain between the two countries, including over
modifications to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. By

 &HT;    Bush's silence on census draws fire from right, left
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The controversy over how to count the population
for the 2000 Census is threatening to ensnare Texas Gov. George W.
Bush's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether the next president will give the states
population figures that have been adjusted by the Census Bureau
after the traditional head count. Proponents say that the figures,
adjusted using a process called statistical sampling, will give a
truer picture of the population and particularly of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of sampling say that only an actual count of the
population should be used to draw electoral districts and
distribute federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's response has so far been silence, which has angered
people on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is trying to have it both ways,'' said Matt Glavin,
president of the Atlanta-based Southeastern Legal Foundation. The
public interest law firm has successfully sued the government to
prevent the adjusted numbers from being used to determine how many
seats in the U.S. House of Representatives go to each state.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic members of congressional caucuses representing
African-Americans, Hispanics and Asian-Americans also asked Bush to
take a position. ``We ask you to end your silence on this issue,''
said a letter that was signed by Democratic Reps. Carrie Meek of
Florida and Charles Gonzalez of Texas and Delegate Eni Faleomavaega
of American Samoa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you stand with those who would deny minorities, children
and the poor fair representation and economic benefits for purely
partisan political reasons?'' the letter added.
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma for Bush is that he is making a determined effort to
attract Hispanic support and yet not alienate his Republican base.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic groups, like other advocates for minorities, support
the use of sampling because they believe it will correct the
massive undercount that plagued the 1990 Census.
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans, including the majority of Republicans in the
U.S. House who support Bush, oppose sampling on philosophical and
political grounds. They argue that sampling is unconstitutional and
fear that Democrats would gain from its use since sampling would
likely increase the numbers of traditionally Democratic minority
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is going ahead with sampling all
purposes other than apportionment, including redrawing electoral
boundaries and population-based formulas for federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   The data, however, will not be sent until April 1, 2001, or
three months after the next president takes office.
</P>
<P>
   This explains the emergence of this issue in the GOP campaign.
Bush's refusal to answer is ``unconscionable,'' Glavin said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker repeated the governor's standard
line on the issue when she was asked specifically whether he would
allow the use of the adjusted numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believes everybody should be counted,'' Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the other Republican candidates have taken a stand. Gary
Bauer, Steve Forbes and Alan Keyes said they would not send the
adjusted numbers to the states. John McCain has said that he would.
</P>
<P>
   N.Y. BALLOT BATTLE MOVES INTO COURT
</P>
<P>
   McCain filed a lawsuit in New York last week to make it easier
for candidates to get on the ballot for the state's March 7
primary. New York is legendary for its arcane ballot requirements,
which favor well-funded candidates and those who are backed by the
party leadership. Bush is the choice of most of New York's top
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates who want to be on the ballot across the state have to
obtain signatures on petitions in each of New York's 31
congressional districts. The petitions often are challenged, and
disqualifications are frequent. A registered voter can sign only
one petition, and the signature must be witnessed by the person
circulating the petition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a daunting process, and you never know where a mine is
going to go off,'' said Staten Island borough President Guy
Molinari, McCain's leading supporter in New York. ``We're doing our
damnedest, but we're also hoping for some help.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's lawsuit seeks to make it easier for candidates with
``legitimate statewide'' support to appear on the ballot and to
reduce the potential for challenges. As evidence of McCain's
support, his campaign pointed to a new Quinnipiac College poll,
which shows that McCain is the choice of 24 percent of likely
Republican primary voters.
</P>
<P>
   Molinari said he doubts that McCain can qualify in all 31
districts. In some districts, the campaign has not yet begun
circulating petitions, he said.

 &HT;        Small business has many voices in Washington 
 &HT;     By Tania Anderson  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- When a small business owner gets fed up enough to
put money into a Washington advocacy group, they have plenty of
choices.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is notorious for having different kinds of voices to
fight for certain issues on Capitol Hill. And the small business
community is not lacking. Almost every piece of legislation going
through the hands of Capitol Hill politicos affects small business
in some way.
</P>
<P>
   Advocacy groups are preparing the battleground for the proposed
ergonomics rule, health care issues, the death tax and other
regulatory restrictions on small business.
</P>
<P>
   With annual membership dues ranging from $100 to $2,500, why
would a small business owner invest in one of these groups? The
lure is dictated by three factors - the fear of adverse action on
Capitol Hill; an ideological affinity with the group; or some
economic incentive to join.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers on the Senate and House small business committees
recognize certain players in Washington when it comes to small
business interests - The National Federation of Independent
Business, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Small Business Survival
Committee and the National Small Business Union. The leaders of
these groups often get tapped to offer congressional testimony on
certain issues facing the committees.
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   Tied with the National Rifle Association as the second most
powerful lobbying group in Washington by Fortune magazine, NFIB
lobbies for its 600,000 small business members on a variety of
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Its victories include deductions on self-employed health care, a
reduction in the death tax and a cut in the capital gains rate.
</P>
<P>
   NFIB has been lead by Jack Ferris for the last seven years and
has made his mark fighting against government-mandated health care
coverage. Dubbed by the press as ``silver-haired and
``acid-tongued,'' Ferris lead a fight to repeal the death tax and
convinced Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich that greater estate
tax relief was a priority.
</P>
<P>
   Ferris' ability to build up a financially powerful lobbying
organization comes from his days as the campaign finance director
for former presidential candidate Lamar Alexander's gubernatorial
campaign in 1978. Ferris also worked as executive director of the
Republican National Finance committee.
</P>
<P>
   NFIB's $4.2 million budget is one of the largest in Washington
association groups. The 1998 budget - the latest numbers available
- is almost double from the previous year. The group also makes
$1.2 million in political campaign contributions, 93 percent going
to Republican candidates, according to the Center for Responsive
Politics.
</P>
<P>
   NFIB celebrates the small business owner on its website by
sprinkling it with small business success stories and anecdotes.
Each day's home page features a large color picture of one of its
members.
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has always had the reputation of
being a big-business advocacy group, but 96 percent of its members
are businesses with 100 or fewer employees.
</P>
<P>
   The Chamber represents 3 million companies, 3,000 state and
local chambers, 850 business associations and 87 American Chambers
of Commerce abroad. The organization, lead by Thomas Donohue, has
been working to stop Y2K lawsuits, helping companies to find
workers and expanding American exports.
</P>
<P>
   Victories for the last year include putting caps on punitive
damages on Y2K lawsuits for businesses with fewer than 50
employees, stopping Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy's amendment to
raise the minimum wage by $1 over two years and restoring Medicare
funding to service providers.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue, the chamber's president and chief executive since 1997,
is credited with putting some life back into an organization that
lost its spark in the early 1990s. He expanded the organization
from three lobbyists to 17 and increased the chamber's annual
budget from $60 million to $90 million in the last two years. The
chamber also reports $31,151 in political campaign contributions,
98 percent going to Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Donohue's lobbying command started as the head of the American
Trucking Associations. The New York City native also worked as
deputy assistant postmaster general in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Chamber recently secured $24 million from a Washington area
venture capitalist to start an Internet portal for small business
owners.
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   The Small Business Survival Committee may sound like some
militant activist group, but the SBSC is regarded as a serious
Washington player among advocacy groups.
</P>
<P>
   The group, established five years ago, has more than 50,000
members representing both entrepreneurs and small business owners.
The main focus on its two leaders is to fight against ``unchecked
regulation and burdensome taxes imposed on America's small business
sector and workforce.''
</P>
<P>
   The group is often called to Capitol Hill to testify before the
Senate and House small business committees. The latest testimonials
from its chairman, Karen Kerrigan, range from pushing for small
business start-up accounts to electricity deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   SBSC was one of the only small business interests represented at
the most recent Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce meeting
in San Francisco. The commission is mandated by Congress to find a
solution to the issue of taxing Internet commerce by April 2000.
Chris Wysocki, the newly-appointed president of SBSC, gave one of
13 presentations and pushed for a permanent ban on taxes on
electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan's name appeared on National Journal's 1995 short list
of Washington's conservative lobbyists under age 40 who will most
likely make a difference on Capitol Hill soon after she started
SBSC in 1994. Kerrigan previously worked as the national field
director of the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste and
headed the Taxpayer's Action Network.
</P>
<P>
   Wysocki joined SBSC four months ago to increase the membership
base by establishing cross-marketing agreements with other
companies that provide discounts on goods and services like
shipping and pre-paid legal insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The group's 1998 expenditures hit $600,000, a significant
increase from the $100,000 it spent in lobbying the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   National Small Business United, started in 1937, helped initiate
the White House Conference on Small Business, where 20,000 small
business owners crafted 60 recommendations designed to address
issues facing small business and forwarded to Congress and
President Clinton in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   NSBU's priorities include tax reform, entitlement reform and
payroll tax relief and improving pension options for small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The organization is represented by a board of 32 small business
owners and lead by NSBU's president, Todd McCracken, who has
testified on Capitol Hill on the Small Business Year 2000 Readiness
Act.
</P>
<P>
   One of the ways the group raises money is through the Small
Business Victory Fund, which endorses candidates with a record of
support for small business or are former small business owners
themselves.

week away, many of them are booked solid and some have had to turn
away business. Some security guards are getting $20 an hour to work
Y2k. The security scenario is one more tale of a city bulging with
jobs and no one to take fill them. (Joyner, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)

   SHOPLIFTING _ It's a gangbuster holiday season for retailers,
but it's also one for shoplifters. The more shoppers in retail
stores, the greater the chance that the employees will be
distracted. Thieves are lifting everything from athletic shoes to
CD's, which rank among the nation's most stolen items, according to
a 1998-1999 study conducted by Loss Prevention Specialists, a
consulting group in Winter Park, Fla. (Degross, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)

   BELLSOUTH _ ATLANTA With the millennium rapidly approaching,
BellSouth is lending a helping hand to CARE, the international
humanitarian relief organization, to assist with its Year 2000
readiness program. (Kanell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   WEB-CHURCHES _ AUSTIN, Texas _ You'd think that the Internet,
with its reputation for perpetuating pornography and its new bent
as a shopping mecca, would be enough to discouarage the Web as a
serious place to begin a spiritual journey. But houses of worship
are hoping that the Internet will educate, inspire and spread the
word as they rush to create online presences to promote their
churches, synagogues and even online-only religions. (Gallaga,
Austin American-Statesman)

MAXIMA MAXIMIZES COMFORT AND PERFORMANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An already good car just got a whole lot better.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan has updated its flagship Maxima sedan for 2000, and if
you're in the market for a family car in the same class as the
Toyota Camry, Honda Accord and Ford Taurus, you'd better take a
look at this one.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 Maxima is one of several new vehicles rolled out in the
past few months by the revitalized Nissan, whose current lineup
proves that this Japanese automaker means business and plans to
stay around awhile.
</P>
<P>
   With prices starting at $21,049, the Maxima offers a lot of
comfort and performance for the money.
</P>
<P>
   If value is more important than prestige, remember that a fully
equipped Maxima, at about $28,000, is essentially the same car as
the Infiniti I30. But prices on the Infiniti run into the low
$30,000s. (The I30 is also completely updated for 2000.)
</P>
<P>
   As with the Camry and the Lexus ES 300, the main difference
between the high-end Maxima and the I30 is the price: You pay more
for the luxury-brand name.
</P>
<P>
   With the Maxima and the lower-priced Altima, Nissan is in the
enviable position of having two good midsize sedans in two distinct
price ranges. If you can't quite afford a Maxima, you can choose
the lower-priced yet outstanding Altima.
</P>
<P>
   But if you can swing a higher price tag and monthly payment, the
Maxima will reward you. The car is roomy enough for five adults,
the trunk holds up to 15.1 cubic feet, and the updated exterior
styling gives the vehicle a distinctive, appealing look.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the sportiest sedans on the market in the low- to
mid-$20,000s, and for 2000, the car is more fun to drive than ever.
That's partly due to the upgraded 3.0-liter V-6 engine, now with a
whopping 222 horsepower _ up 32 from last year. This engine is
standard throughout the Maxima model lineup; there is no extra
charge to get this much power.
</P>
<P>
   Three models are offered: the base GXE, with the $21,049 price
tag for a five-speed manual version and a sticker of $22,749 for
the one with a four-speed automatic transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Next in the lineup is the SE, the one we tested. Listing at
$23,649 for the manual version and $24,149 for the automatic, the
SE is the sportiest Maxima.
</P>
<P>
   The most luxurious model is the GLE, which comes only with
automatic transmission. List price is $26,249. Leather interior is
standard on the GLE.
</P>
<P>
   Our test car came with leather, but it was a $1,249 option. For
those who want the best performance, the SE is the best choice. It
comes with a stiffer suspension than the GLE or GXE, offering much
better road-hugging abilities and true driver road feel. With the
manual transmission, this is the car for driving enthusiasts who
must have a sedan for practical purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Standard equipment is plentiful even on the base model. The GXE
comes with manual air-conditioning, alarm system, automatic
headlights, AM/FM/cassette stereo, cloth front bucket seats,
split-folding rear bench seat, cruise control, power windows and
door locks with remote control, intermittent wipers, tilt steering
wheel, rear defroster, dual power mirrors, tachometer and more.
</P>
<P>
   With the SE, you get some sportier accessories, including
15-inch aluminum alloy wheels, AM/FM/cassette/compact-disc stereo,
front fog lights, leather-wrapped steering wheel, rear spoiler and
sport suspension.
</P>
<P>
   The GLE, the one that is essentially the same as the I30, comes
with automatic transmission, automatic climate control, leather
seats and leather-wrapped steering wheel, eight-way power driver's
seat, four-way power passenger seat, premium Bose
AM/FM/cassette/compact-disc stereo, built-in garage-door opener,
simulated leather door panels and wood interior trim.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not a big fan of manual transmissions in family sedans. But
if you must have a manual gearbox, the Maxima's is one of the best.
Nissan, in its belief that most auto reviewers are ``car guys'' who
eschew automatic transmissions, furnished only a manual
transmission Maxima for me to test. Therefore, I can't tell you how
well the automatic works. That's unfortunate, because about 95
percent of Maxima buyers will choose the automatic.
</P>
<P>
   Options on our test model included the ``SE comfort and
convenience package'' ($1,799), which added a sun roof, 17-inch
alloy wheels with V-rated tires, the eight-way power driver's seat,
built-in garage-door opener, variable intermittent wipers and a
trunk cargo net; the leather package ($1,249), which also brought
the power passenger seat and automatic climate control; and the
Bose audio system ($899).
</P>
<P>
   These additions raised the sticker to $28,295, including $520
transportation. The included equipment made our test car the
equivalent of an I30 with manual transmission and sport suspension.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings for the manual transmission models are
21 miles per gallon in the city and 27 mpg on the highway. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   AT A GLANCE: 2000 Nissan Maxima SE sedan &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE PACKAGE: Midsize, front-wheel-drive, four-door,
five-passenger, V-6 powered sports sedan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HIGHLIGHTS: Completely redesigned for 2000, Nissan's flagship
sedan is essentially the same car as the much higher-priced
Infiniti I30. The SE model is the sporty one, with a firmer
suspension and sportier trim. Great power from the V-6 engine,
excellent roadhandling and wonderful creature comforts inside. This
is a truly nice vehicle. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEGATIVES: Suspension is not as good as it could be; the rear
suspension is not independent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MAJOR COMPETITORS: Ford Taurus/Mercury Sable, Honda Accord,
Toyota Camry, Mitsubishi Diamante, Pontiac Grand Prix, Volvo S70,
Mazda Millenia, Oldsmobile Intrigue, Volkswagen Passat, Saab 9-3,
Chevrolet Impala LS. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EPA FUEL ECONOMY: 21 miles per gallon city/27 highway (manual
transmission). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BASE PRICE, SE model, manual: $23,649 plus $520 transportation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PRICE AS TESTED: $28,295, including transportation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ON THE ROAD RATING: A-plus. &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A powerful jet stream disturbance, driven by winds over 170 mph,
will cross the Appalachians Friday. This will induce low pressure
over the Carolinas, which will bring a bit of light snow to the
Smokey Mountains and parts of the North Carolina piedmont.
Meanwhile, high clouds and cooler winds will follow a cool front in
Florida as morning showers depart southern sections.
</P>
<P>
   An exceptionally cold air mass both aloft and at the surface
will swing eastward from the Ohio Valley into the Northeastern
states. As a result, snow showers will be common near the eastern
Great Lakes and over the higher terrain of New England.
Temperatures will average about 10 degrees lower than Thursday, and
a brisk breeze will raise the risk of frostbite during lengthy
exposure outside.
</P>
<P>
   In the central states, milder air will push eastward from the
upper Plains, but cold air will be stubborn to depart the upper
Midwest. Clouds will be abundant from the eastern Dakotas to the
western Great Lakes. Sunshine and light winds will mark a warming
trend in the central Plains. A disturbance over northern Mexico
should keep low clouds and drizzle over the Rio Grande Valley. Some
clouds will advance into southern New Mexico and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Expansive high pressure, crested over Idaho with a central
pressure of nearly 31 inches of mercury, will dominate conditions
over the western half of the nation. Very mild air will circulate
from the Southwest into the northern Rockies. Gusty canyon winds
will persist in southern California.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Weather balloons launched in the Ohio Valley on Wednesday
measured winds over 200 mph at 35,000 feet. A wide river of very
fast moving air was located from the southern Plains to New
England. This jet stream was driven by a huge temperature contrast
between arctic air in the Midwest and the remnants of autumn warmth
off the East Coast. The density difference between these air masses
causes air pressure to decrease more rapidly with height in the
colder air mass. This leads to strong pressure differences at high
altitudes. These strong pressure differences produced the fierce
winds.

 &HT;    Holidays busy season for shoplifters
 &HT;    By Renee DeGross
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's a gangbuster holiday season for retailers, but
it's also one for shoplifters.
</P>
<P>
   Thieves, including store employees, are lifting everything from
athletic shoes to CDs, which rank among the nation's most stolen
items, according to a study conducted by Loss Prevention
Specialists Inc., a consulting group in Winter Park, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   And they're doing it at a time when stores are struggling to
find enough personnel to staff their aisles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employees are less vigilant (in spotting shoplifters) because
they're busy,'' said Read Hayes, president of Loss Prevention
Specialists. ``Many are temporary help and may not be well-trained
or motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   Danny Murphy, vice president of loss prevention for Wolf Camera,
added, ``As the traffic and volume increases, so does the
shoplifting.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. businesses lose $17 billion to shoplifting and employee
theft each year, Loss Prevention Specialists' 1998-1999 Retail
Theft Trends Report says. The average theft amount per incident was
$60.74, up from $58.43 in the 1997-1998 survey. The thefts account
for about 2 percent of retailers' gross sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``That adds up to lost profits to the retailer,'' said Don
Taylor, a marketing vice president of the Boca Raton, Fla.-based
Sensormatic Electronics Corp. ``And it ends up costing consumers.''
Sensormatic makes store surveillance and merchandise theft devices.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers pass along their increased costs to patrons, Taylor
said. Among the hardest hit during the holidays are department
stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoplifting is a problem,'' said J.C. Penney spokeswoman
Stephanie Brown in Plano, Texas. ``During the holidays, we do beef
up security, but we don't disclose as to what extent. We don't want
to give any hints (to shoplifters).''
</P>
<P>
   To combat the problem, retailers install theft sensors on
merchandise and at doors, hire security guards and use mystery
shoppers. Some businesses are fighting back by installing more
sophisticated surveillance cameras and placing more guards inside
and outside their stores.
</P>
<P>
   A large part of the theft, 43 percent, is committed by
employees, according to Sensormatic. That's where mystery shoppers
come into play, said Mark Michelson, president of the Chicago-based
Mystery Shopping Providers Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mystery shopper is commonly used to do a cash transaction at
a store and observe what happens to the receipts,'' said Michelson,
who is also president and chief executive of Michelson &AMP; Associates
in Atlanta. Mystery shoppers often wear tiny cameras to record
employee actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more technology we have, the more safeguards we have,''
Michelson said.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 deterrent, Murphy said, is customer service, which he
says lets patrons know salespersons are aware of their presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``When retailers do that correctly, that's the best thing to
prevent shoplifters.''

<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `ANY GIVEN SUNDAY,' starring Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz, Dennis
Quaid, James Woods and Jamie Foxx. Directed by Oliver Stone (R, 160
minutes). Stone's brawling, hyper-macho professional football film
has enough in-the-thick-of-it playing-field action to satisfy the
fantasies of most armchair players. In the style of Stone's ``Wall
Street,'' the movie is also a crude morality play that pits the old
ways versus the new with the veteran coach Tony D'Amato (Pacino)
embodying tradition and a young hot-shot quarterback Willie Beamen
(Foxx) the new. Although the acting is uneven (Ms. Diaz is
disappointing as a tough team owner), and the final scenes are
shamelessly ``Rocky''-ish, the movie delivers a credible,
action-charged vision of the frenzied world of professional sports
as a metaphor for the volatility of American culture (Stephen
Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `AMERICAN BEAUTY,' starring Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Chris
Cooper, Wes Bentley and Thora Birch. Written by Alan Ball. Directed
by Sam Mendes (R, 116 minutes). With heavenly finesse Spacey plays
a buttoned-down 42-year-old suburbanite who flips his lid for a
teen-age cheerleader. And he never gets it back on. The midlife
crisis motif is familiar, but the stage director Sam Mendes brings
terrific visual flair and dry humor to this barbecuing of the
bourgeoisie. All the actors display coolly expert timing,
especially Ms. Bening as the antihero's grasping wife. Although the
story spreads itself thin among many characters, the film coalesces
for a devastating finale (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``AMERICAN MOVIE,' featuring Mark Borchardt and friends.
Directed by Chris Smith (R, 104 minutes). An insightful, funny,
not-to-be-missed documentary about a no-budget Wisconsin filmmaker
who makes a horror film as if his life depended on it. And as Smith
so affectingly reveals, Borchardt's hopes really do hang in the
balance. This knowing and often hilarious look at try-anything
indie filmmaking becomes a moving portrait of one man's uphill
struggle and finds Borchardt often describing success and
prosperity as his goals. Meanwhile, his own life is eloquently
presented as a very different, no less authentic kind of American
Dream (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `ANNA AND THE KING,' starring Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat.
Directed by Andy Tennant (PG-13, 140 minutes). The same story that
inspired the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical ``The King and I'' is
the basis for this movie about the British schoolteacher Anna
Leonowens (Ms. Foster) who travels to Bangkok in 1862 to educate
the 58 children of King Mongkut (Chow). Although the story has been
given a contemporary multicultural perspective that's critical of
British imperialism, the picturesque film tells essentially the
same story but without the beloved songs, which are badly missed.
Ms. Foster's Anna is another of her nobler-than-thou ice queens,
and Chow's king is authoritative but less than thunderous
(Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `BEING JOHN MALKOVICH,' starring John Cusack, Catherine Keener,
Cameron Diaz and (of course) John Malkovich. Written by Charlie
Kaufman and directed by Spike Jonze (R, 112 minutes). Welcome to
the fun house: in this exhilaratingly quirky first feature by a
stellar video director, the reigning fears and obsessions of a
technology-crazed, voyeuristic culture are given an even wilder
workout than they got from ``The Truman Show.'' Cusack plays a
discouraged puppeteer who accidentally finds a way into Malkovich's
mind. While the ordinary science-fiction plot might go downhill
after revealing its gimmick, this one's inspired craziness goes on
and on. Originality and cleverness abound (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `BICENTENNIAL MAN,' starring Robin Williams, Embeth Davidtz, Sam
Neill and Oliver Platt. Directed by Chris Columbus (PG, 132
minutes). This year's gushy Christmas card from Robin Williams
follows the 200-year quest of a household robot named Andrew to
become human. Directed by the schmaltzmeister Chris Columbus, who
steered this star through ``Mrs. Doubtfire,'' the movie is a
joke-strewn sentimental man-machine allegory determined to make us
feel good about being human and is punctuated by corny speeches
exalting freedom, the joys of sex and the mystery of mortality.
Except for Williams, the acting is strictly of sitcom caliber
(Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `BOYS DON'T CRY,' starring Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny.
Directed by Kimberly Peirce (R, 114 minutes). This stunning debut
feature tells the strange and resonant story of Brandon Teena, who
despite being born Teena Brandon went on to create a charismatic
identity as a young man. Brandon's ultimately wrenching tale may
sound tabloid-ready, but on screen it turns into Theodore Dreiser's
idea of American tragedy. The film makes it hauntingly real and
even tenderly romantic, with the astonishing acting needed to make
it work. One of the year's best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE CIDER HOUSE RULES,' starring Tobey Maguire, Charlize Theron
and Delroy Lindo. Directed by Lasse Halstrom (PG-13, 125 minutes).
Radically downsized in scope, and its examination of the issue of
abortion greatly softened, John Irving's sixth novel (with a
Dickensian screenplay by the author) has been turned into a lovely
World War II-era fable about a young man venturing out into the
world. Maguire is Homer Wells, a doleful innocent raised in an
orphanage by Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine), who performs
abortions. Fleeing the institution with a golden young couple (Ms.
Theron and Paul Rudd), he becomes an apple picker. Sentimental but
smart, the movie has the sweetness and narrative drive of a '40s
``David Copperfield'' (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `CRADLE WILL ROCK,' starring Emily Watson, John Turturro, Ruben
Blades, John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Bill Murray and Vanessa Redgrave.
Written and directed by Tim Robbins (R, 132 minutes). This huge
Depression-era story features well-known figures from Orson Welles
to Nelson Rockefeller to Diego Rivera, and it works them into an
ambitious ``Ragtime''-like tableau. Though too many figures in this
landscape are reduced to naive caricature, Robbins and his
impressive cast bring strong passions to bear upon this (mostly)
true story of a legendary event: the trouble-fraught production of
the banner-waving 1936 agitprop musical ``The Cradle Will Rock'' by
Welles and John Houseman. Robbins and his cast play out all sides
of this event with the certitude that its importance lives on
(Maslin).

 UNDATED: lives on (Maslin).  
<TEXT>
<P>
   `THE END OF THE AFFAIR,' starring Ralph Fiennes, Julianne Moore,
Stephen Rea and Ian Hart. Directed by Neil Jordan (R, 105 minutes).
Jordan's intoxicating version of Graham Greene's 1951 novel, in
which an illicit affair becomes a far greater gamble than either
lover could have imagined. For this fearlessly eclectic filmmaker,
this is one more intelligent, brooding love story with a secret
twist. Fiennes and Ms. Moore breathe life into this story with a
dreamy, erotic intensity that in no way trivializes the film's
underlying ideas about religious faith. Period detail (the setting
is London in the mid-1940s) is sumptuously heightened by the
inspired costume designer Sandy Powell (``Shakespeare in Love'')
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `END OF DAYS,' starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Robin Tunney,
Gabriel Byrne and Kevin Pollak. Directed by Peter Hyams (R, 118
minutes). The star modestly tackles the role of a new savior who
may just keep mankind free of Satan for the next thousand years.
And that's not even the worst thing about this pointlessly nasty
would-be thriller. The material is so derivative that it amounts to
a tag sale of used parts from better apocalyptic films, with
special credit owed to ``The Exorcist'' for grisly sacrilegious
tricks. Hyams favors a jack-in-the-box approach to delivering shock
value. The star dutifully protects a nice young woman from demonic
forces. But Byrne plays the swaggering embodiment of pure evil and
has the better role (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `GIRL, INTERRUPTED,' starring Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie.
Directed by James Mangold (R, 120 minutes). Except for being
several years too old for the role, Winona Ryder, an actress who
oozes high-strung intelligence, is ideally cast as Susanna Kaysen,
a pre-college-age girl who lands in a Cambridge mental institution
in 1967 after a halfhearted suicide attempt. (The movie is based on
Ms. Kaysen's memoir.) The period details are perfect, and Ms. Ryder
has the courage to make her character a pain in the neck. But the
small, introspective movie is nearly stolen by Ms. Jolie as a
charismatic, brutally truth-telling sociopath who becomes Susanna's
best friend (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE GREEN MILE,' starring Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan,
David Morse, Doug Hutchison, Sam Rockwell and Bonnie Hunt. Written
and directed by Frank Darabont (R, 180 minutes). In adapting the
death row drama that Stephen King wrote in multiple installments,
the director of ``The Shawshank Redemption'' could have managed
more economy and fewer talky bits of business around the cell
block. Still, this lengthy film is vivid and well played. Smooth
ensemble acting builds up to the discovery that a gigantic
condemned man (Duncan) is a prisoner with very special abilities,
which gives the film its mixture of religious overtones and mild
horror. Hanks, as a wry Southern prison guard, is so unaffectedly
good that it's redundant to say so (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE INSIDER,' starring Al Pacino, Russell Crowe and Christopher
Plummer. Directed by Michael Mann (R, 155 minutes). Mann directs
this taut thriller about the tobacco industry whistle-blower
Jeffrey Wigand with pulse-quickening panache. And he illustrates
why, in the corporate climate of the 90s, truth-telling is a
riskier business than it was circa ``All the President's Men.''
While Pacino delivers galvanizing moral outrage as a producer for
``60 Minutes,'' and Plummer wickedly mimics Mike Wallace, Crowe
movingly captures the complexity of Wigand's situation. Shaky
docudrama ethics cloud the film's take on ``60 Minutes.'' But this
is an inordinately well-played thriller, with Mann's stylistic brio
at its best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `LIBERTY HEIGHTS,' starring Adrien Brody, Joe Mantegna and Ben
Foster. Directed and written by Barry Levinson (R, 134 minutes).
This semiautobiographical comedy-drama remembering teen-age life,
anti-Semitism and racism in mid-1950s Baltimore is the fourth movie
by Levinson to be set in his native city. A deeply felt nostalgia
trip, the movie adroitly captures the look and social attitudes of
the city 45 years ago. But the screenplay and performances are too
muted for the movie to come to terms with growing pains cushioned
in the nostalgic haze (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `MAGNOLIA,' starring Tom Cruise, Melinda Dillon, Philip Seymour
Hoffman, William H. Macy, Julianne Moore, John C. Reilly and Jason
Robards. Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson (R, 180
minutes). In ``Magnolia'' the colossally talented Anderson has set
up an artfully orchestrated symphony of intersecting L.A. stories,
with many of the cast members from his ``Boogie Nights'' assembled
to form a charismatic ensemble. The movie is saved from its own
worst ideas by the intimacy of the performances. Its single biggest
surprise is Tom Cruise in the role of a strutting,
obscenity-spouting cult figure named Frank Mackey (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `MAN ON THE MOON,' starring Jim Carrey and Danny DeVito.
Directed by Milos Forman (R, 118 minutes). Carrey delivers an
electrifying homage in Forman's vivid re-creation of Andy Kaufman's
too-short and enduringly strange career. In a film that summons its
subject's most memorable creative inventions as a series of
greatest hits, Carrey makes a flawless, uncanny impersonator. But
what is missing here, though it might have been the first thing
expected from an ostensible film biography, is an answer to the
simplest question: Who was Andy Kaufman, and how did he get that
way? (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `MANSFIELD PARK,' starring Frances O'Connor and Jonny Lee
Miller. Written and directed by Patricia Rozema (PG-13, 105
minutes). In Ms. Rozema's skillful screen adaptation of Jane
Austen's third novel, the protagonist Fanny Price (Ms. O'Connor)
has been sharpened into a proto-feminist heroine who triumphs over
the materialist, patriarchal values of her wealthy relatives
through a combination of wit, beauty and daring. Without bearing
down too heavily, the screenplay (which incorporates fragments of
Austen's letters and diaries) equates early 19th-century slave
trading with the oppression of women. The message is leavened with
smart humor and warm three-dimensional performances (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `ONEGIN,' starring Ralph Fiennes, Liv Tyler and Martin Donovan.
Directed by Martha Fiennes (not rated, 106 minutes). As the
directorial debut of Fiennes' sister Martha, ``Onegin'' diminishes
Alexander Pushkin's epic 19th-century novel ``Evgeny Onegin'' into
a cramped little soap opera whose two stars are painfully
mismatched. While Fiennes acts up a fine storm as the arrogant,
cynical title character who doesn't believe in love, Ms. Tyler, who
plays his romantic nemesis, is an inert cipher. Somehow, even the
grand ballrooms of 1820s St. Petersburg look drab and chintzy
(Holden). &QL;

<P>
   `SLEEPY HOLLOW,' starring Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda
Richardson, Michael Gambon, Jeffrey Jones, Michael Gough and
Christopher Walken. Written by Andrew Kevin Walker and directed by
Tim Burton (R, 110 minutes). This ornate visual fantasy, artfully
concocted using a palette that suggests nuclear winter, has little
to do with Washington Irving's story and everything to do with
Burton's macabre vision. Depp makes a dashing hero as the film's
shy detective, but the story (by the writer of ``Seven'' and
``Fight Club'') is determined to put the ick into Ichabod Crane. A
first-rate cast and extraordinary technical talents are
attention-getting here, but so is the film's penchant for sardonic
beheadings. It's possible to admire Burton immensely for the secret
tenderness and rich imagination of his work without wanting to peer
at the exposed brain stems of his characters (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS,' starring Ethan Hawke, James Cromwell
and Max Von Sydow. Directed by Scott Hicks (PG-13, 130 minutes).
This director's follow-up to ``Shine'' is the cinematic equivalent
of an arty coffee-table book. It is so busy illustrating the story
(with elaborate flashbacks and montage sequences) that it forgets
to be dramatic. Set in the Pacific Northwest in 1950, the movie
looks back to World War II and the charged relationships between
Japanese-Americans and whites on an island north of the Puget
Sound. Hawke is the brooding reporter covering the trial and Von
Sydow the defense lawyer who is the film's official conscience.
Robert Richardson is responsible for the gorgeous cinematography
(Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `STUART LITTLE,' starring Geena Davis, Hugh Laurie and Jonathan
Lipnicki. Directed by Rob Minkoff (PG, 92 minutes). E.B. White's
1945 children's classic has been adapted into a lovely family film
about a little mouse (the voice of Michael J. Fox) who is adopted
by humans but runs afoul of their fluffy white Persian house cat,
Snowbell (Nathan Lane). The movie creates an enchanted storybook
version of New York and has what may be the most exciting toy boat
race (in Central Park) ever filmed. Thanks to Lane's sly, wise-guy
vocal impersonation, Snowbell nearly steals a movie that is funny
and sweet but never cloying (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `SWEET AND LOWDOWN,' starring Sean Penn, Samantha Morton and Uma
Thurman. Directed by Woody Allen (PG-13, 95 minutes). In homage to
the kind of jaunty 1930s jazz that has been heard on many of his
other films' soundtracks, Allen imagines a consummate jazz
character: Emmet Ray (played with gusto by Penn), who can play the
guitar as gorgeously as Django Reinhardt but lacks certain
interpersonal skills when it comes to his private life. Borrowing
attributes of various real musicians, the film turns Emmet into
another one of Allen's cad-geniuses and gives him a long-suffering
mute laundress as a sweetheart. (Ms. Morton works miracles in her
wordless role.) But on the storytelling level, the film remains
flimsy. It's the musical interludes, frequent and lovingly
presented, that keep it alive (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TOPSY-TURVY,' starring Allan Corduner and Jim Broadbent.
Directed by Mike Leigh (R, 161 minutes). Leigh's grandly
entertaining ``Topsy-Turvy'' is one of those films that create a
mix of erudition, pageantry and delectable acting opportunities,
much as ``Shakespeare in Love'' did last year. Instead of a
love-struck young playwright, it presents the curiously matched
personalities of the librettist William Schwenk Gilbert and the
composer Arthur Sullivan in the midst of a robust, knowing,
frequently hilarious look at the musical theater over which they
held sway (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TOY STORY 2,' with the voices of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen.
Directed by John Lasseter; a Pixar Animated Studios film (G, 98
minutes). A wonderfully playful sequel, sustaining the first film's
wit and novelty while bringing new sophistication to
computer-generated animation. And here is welcome proof that
Hollywood can still make movies to please audiences of any age or
persuasion. From its opening (a perfectly adorable ``Star Wars''
parody) to its Capraesque conclusion, this is seamless work with
more metaphorical cleverness than that usually found in the toy
bin. Colorful new characters and more adventurous action enhance
the story of how Woody falls into the clutches of a sleazy toy
dealer, experiences new-found celebrity and needs to be rescued by
his fabulous old friends (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TUMBLEWEEDS,' starring Janet McTeer and Kimberly J. Brown.
Directed by Gavin O'Connor (PG-13, 100 minutes). An astoundingly
vital performance by the British actress Janet McTeer makes this
small, beautifully acted slice of contemporary Americana a must-see
film. Ms. McTeer is Mary Jo Walker, a sexy, free-spirited woman
with four marriages behind her who travels across the country with
her 12-year-old daughter, Ava (Ms. Brown). Like few other films,
this one captures an intimately loving (though not conflict-free)
relationship between a parent and child without becoming
saccharine. The director plays Mary Jo's trucker boyfriend, who is
only the latest in a series of romantic disasters (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `THE WAR ZONE,' starring Freddie Cunliffe, Ray Winstone, Tilda
Swinton and Lara Belmont. Directed by Tim Roth (not rated, 99
minutes). Roth is an actor known for roles in tough films, but
never for anything quite as raw as this. In this searing first
feature, the title battlefield is a rural English home where a
teen-age boy looks upon his own family with helpless rage and
astonishment. Sensing the incestuous relationship between his
father and older sister, the film's wordless, baleful young hero
struggles to come to terms with this household horror. Understated
but extremely graphic at times, and shot with mournfully expressive
simplicity by Seamus McGarvey (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH,' starring Pierce Brosnan, Sophie
Marceau, Dame Judi Dench, Robert Carlyle and Denise Richards.
Directed by Michael Apted (PG-13, 128 minutes). This director is
much admired for his ``Up'' series chronicling the lives of former
schoolchildren as they mature. And he has managed to make James
Bond grow up a little, too. Brosnan has grown much more comfortable
with the role of Bond, and most of the other characters are also
more interesting than might have been expected. Ms. Marceau slinks
memorably through the role of a treacherous oil heiress. Ms.
Richards seemed a lot smarter playing high school vixens than she
does as a brilliant scientist here. The itinerary roams from
Scotland to Central Asia. And Apted handles the action as well as
he does the talk (Maslin). Film Series
</P>
<P>
   `COLUMBIA 75.' With more than a month behind it and three weeks
still to go, Film Forum is past the midpoint of its 75-film
festival celebrating the 75th anniversary of Columbia Pictures. But
there are still plenty of cinematic riches to come. Friday's double
feature consists of two Kim Novak starring vehicles, Joshua Logan's
``Picnic'' (1955), with William Holden, and Richard Quine's ``Bell,
Book and Candle'' (1958), with James Stewart, Ernie Kovacs and Jack
Lemmon. For Saturday and Sunday the attractions are George Sidney's
``Bye Bye Birdie'' (1965) with Ann-Margret and Dick Van Dyke, and
Elliot Silverstein's ``Cat Ballou,'' with Jane Fonda as an outlaw
and Lee Marvin in an Academy Award-winning dual role as a drunken
gunslinger and his tin-nosed evil twin. The series continues
through Jan. 13 at Film Forum, 209 W. Houston St.t, in the South
Village. Admission is $9; $5 for members. Screening schedule and
information: (212) 727-8110 (Lawrence Van Gelder).

<P>
   The disillusionment that followed World War I and was felt all
over Europe saturates ``Rebellion,'' a spare, brooding novel by
Joseph Roth and the last of this brilliantly allegorical writer's
books to be translated into English. Serialized in the German
socialist newspaper Vorwarts in 1924, ``Rebellion'' was the third
of Roth's 15 novels, published after the similarly disillusioned
``Hotel Savoy'' but a decade before his masterpiece of the fallen
Austro-Hungarian Empire, ``The Radetzky March.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rebellion'' is reminiscent of Chekhov in its uncluttered,
melancholy simplicity, while its sense of the larger, crushing
incomprehensibility of things echoes Roth's older contemporary,
Franz Kafka. It provides brief, crisscrossing lives of several
characters, though mostly it tells of the short, afflicted span of
Andreas Pum, a war amputee who enjoys a few brief weeks of
happiness before he is crushed.
</P>
<P>
   Crushed by what? That is the question. ``Rebellion'' was written
during what is seen as Roth's leftist period (he later became a
monarchist nostalgic for the defunct Austro-Hungarian Empire), and
so it is reasonable to see this novel as an allegory of the
brutality of capitalist power.
</P>
<P>
   It is in some ways. Roth's Andreas is an unschooled
working-class man ignorant of the means of self-advancement known
to the more privileged castes. He is therefore defenseless against
the middle class' unreasoning fear of the workers, the brutality of
the police, the indifference of the courts and the lurking
anti-Semitism that conflates Jews with Bolsheviks.
</P>
<P>
   But what destroys Andreas Pum is something subtle and mysterious
and not obviously political. It is Andreas' own passivity, for one
thing, his very obedience to the institutions that roll over him
without even noticing him. ``Rebellion'' in this sense is a satire
on a kind of Candidean naivete, a misplaced trust. Andreas' fate is
very different from that of another working-class down-and-out,
Willi, who hustles his way to the top of the heap by virtue of a
criminal aptitude that Andreas doesn't possess.
</P>
<P>
   But what gives ``Rebellion'' its mystifying power is its
depiction of personal fate as governed by the blind, casual
workings of a machine controlled by no one and for which no one is
responsible. Roth's novel in this sense can be read as a
theological statement about the capriciousness of a universe devoid
of a benevolent God. Or it can be read more philosophically, with
Andreas Pum representing one of the first alienated antiheroes of
European literature.
</P>
<P>
   The reader first encounters Andreas in a military hospital at
the end of World War I. His leg has been amputated and he has been
awarded a medal. Far from being emotionally stricken, he feels
proud and superior to the other wounded soldiers, those with ``no
God, no Emperor, no Fatherland,'' whom Andreas calls heathens.
</P>
<P>
   When he is released from the hospital, Andreas' chest decoration
provides him with a certain honor, and he has papers that give him
the right to operate a barrel organ on the street. One day he meets
a widow, Frau Blumich, and he immediately decides that ``there was
no one in the world who meant more to him.'' The widow, stout and
amply endowed, has other suitors, but she chooses Andreas as her
husband not in spite of his war wound but because of it. ``Reason
counseled a bird whose wings had already been clipped, because that
would be easier to keep and required less in the way of strenuous
training.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as Andreas' cup becomes full, it is abruptly emptied
because of a capricious chain of circumstance. A certain Herr
Arnold, a well-off businessman, makes a clumsy pass at his
secretary, and the awkward consequences of this gesture put him
into a foul and aggressive mood. Arnold's troubles have nothing to
do with Andreas. But the two of them encounter each other on a
tram, and, as a consequence, Andreas is dragged off to jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``But such is the treacherous way of Fate: we are doomed not by
our own fault, and sometimes without our even perceiving a
connection; we are doomed by the blind rage of a stranger with
whose story we are unfamiliar, to whose misfortune we are
unconnected, and with whose opinions we are even in agreement. He
and no other is the instrument in the casually devastating hand of
Destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   The terrifying misadventure that befalls Andreas is mirrored and
intensified by Roth's narrative detachment, which is an essential
part of this writer's genius. As Michael Hofmann, the novel's
translator, puts it in a helpful introduction, Roth's sensibility
resembles that of other figures of early Weimar culture, for
example the caricaturist George Grosz, who took ordinary subjects
from ordinary life and gave them monstrous forms.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with Grosz, Roth is understated. Yet his simple
narrative sentences tread like jackboots over the reader's
consciousness. When Andreas' wife repudiates him with the words
``wretched cripple,'' she knocks over a plaster vase. ``The water
drained out of it, gurgling, and fell in single melancholy drops
from the edge of the oilcloth cover onto the floor.'' With that
image, one sees the spilling of Andreas' very existence and the
utter absence of redeeming love.
</P>
<P>
   Andreas, in his shock and disillusionment, transforms himself
from a dutiful subject of God and Empire into one of the heathens
he used to scorn, expressing his new awareness in a furious
how-could-You-have-abandoned-me complaint shouted directly to the
Divinity. But while he achieves a kind of enlightenment, it is the
bitter epiphany of philosophical nihilism, one that seems eerily
appropriate in light of what subsequently happened to Roth himself.
</P>
<P>
   At the time he wrote his early novels, Roth was a successful and
well-paid journalist with no evident reason for pessimism. But in
1926, we learn from Hofmann's introduction, he visited the Soviet
Union and soured on the idea of the radiant revolutionary future.
When the Nazis came to power in Germany in 1933, he moved to Paris,
where he turned to drink and died in 1939. The biting pessimism of
``Rebellion'' spookily prefigures Roth's own fate in a Europe that
would crush many more worldly figures than Andreas Pum, and with
far greater savagery and evil purpose.

   &UR; FINANCIAL &LR;  (``f'' code)
</P>
<P>
   BANKS-VENTURE-CAPITAL (Undated) _ For venture capitalists, times
have never been richer. Now big banks want a piece of the action.
Since 1996, major commercial banks like Chase Manhattan have
tripled the money they devote to venture capital, the high-risk,
high-return world of financing startup companies. The appeal is
obvious. Chase and its kin are happy to get 8 percent interest on a
typical loan, while the average venture capital investment in a new
company almost doubled this year. And bank stocks have been weak
this year, while stocks in publicly traded venture capital
companies like CMGI have soared. But as banks move deeper into
venture capital, they face some risks of their own. A few banks,
notably Chase and Wells Fargo, have had successful venture arms for
years, but others have little experience with the hyper-competition
of Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-INDUSTRY (Frankfurt, Germany) _ The German government
says it plans to repeal taxes on capital gains from the sale of
industrial holdings inside the country, a move that could reshape
the country's corporate landscape. The large stakes in industrial
companies held by big banks and financial companies have helped
preserve ``fortress Germany'' at a time when the rest of Europe is
undergoing sweeping consolidation. German stocks surge more than 4
percent, led by Allianz, Deutsche Bank and other financial
companies. Allianz alone holds industrial stakes worth $30 billion,
while Deutsche Bank owns stakes worth about $25 billion. The
proposal, however, is vague on many details and in any case must be
approved by both houses of Germany's Parliament. By Edmund L.
Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET (New York) _ Stocks surge. At 2:15 p.m., the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 205 points to 11408, a record. The S&AMP;P
500 was up 23 points, and the Nasdaq composite index up 47 points.
Treasury prices were little changed. European markets were also
higher, with London up 0.85 percent and Frankfurt up 4.17 percent.

Hang Seng index ended up 0.64 percent. By Robert D. Hershey.

`ANGELA'S ASHES': A NEW GLOSS ON POVERTY IN IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(jt) 
 By JANET MASLIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who thinks poverty is not pretty would think twice after
watching the film version of Frank McCourt's best-selling boyhood
memoir. Not since Walker Evans distilled the mournful beauty of
Appalachia, or at least not since the latest fashion layout flirted
with arty desolation, has misery looked this fabulously pristine.
</P>
<P>
   As reverently directed by Alan Parker, ``Angela's Ashes''
presents the tough tales of McCourt's upbringing while harking back
to a quaintly romantic view of deprivation. So in the Irish setting
where the McCourt family wanted for food, coal and decent housing,
it also happens that graffiti, clutter and nonbiodegradable junk
were also in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angela's Ashes'' thus unfolds against fading wallpaper
backdrops that coordinate with the characters' tattered clothing;
alongside clotheslines where the prop department has worked wonders
with the laundry; and on rain-slick streets where sewage looks a
handsome shade of midnight blue. The actors radiate health even
when made up to look pallid. Nobody has indoor plumbing. Everybody
has clean hair.
</P>
<P>
   This emphasis on aesthetic niceties, in a film whose tidily
controlled palette keeps any sense of real suffering at bay, allows
``Angela's Ashes'' to offer a cathartic tsk-tsk for the holiday
season. Just as McCourt's readers could laugh and weep vicariously
at his silver-tongued storytelling, so the film invites empathy
from a comfy distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He turns toward Mam,'' McCourt wrote of his chronically
unreliable father, ``and she says `You're not sleeping in this bed
tonight.' He makes his way downstairs with the candle, sleeps on a
chair, misses work in the morning, loses the job at the cement
factory and we're back on the dole again.'' There's as much craft
as hardship to a recollection like that.
</P>
<P>
   While readers who made the memoir so popular will miss some of
its grit, they are sure to find the material's essential glossiness
familiar. McCourt summoned his anecdotes with indefatigable charm,
no matter how dire the circumstances, to the point where his
autobiographical story became an exemplary pilgrim's progress.
</P>
<P>
   As adapted by Laura Jones and Parker, the film parades a
succession of trials and milestones for young Frank (played
successively by Joe Breen, Ciaran Owens and Michael Legge) like so
many picture postcards. From young Frank's first confession to the
first shilling he earns to support his family, the film's narrative
is as neat as its look.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angela's Ashes'' follows the McCourt family from New York
City, where they are out of place, back to Limerick, Ireland, where
they find themselves even more so. The stalwart, long-suffering
Angela, played with patience and backbone by Emily Watson, comes
from a family that has no use for her husband Malachy (Robert
Carlyle, making the best of a more problematically written role).
</P>
<P>
   Malachy comes from Northern Ireland, which makes him a virtual
foreigner in Limerick, and Angela's family would in any case not
welcome more mouths to feed. In the first part of this lengthy
film, the family suffers ill will and unspeakable hardship,
including the loss of three young children. The kind of detail that
McCourt so memorably provided, and that the film dutifully
reiterates, is that Malachy committed the ultimate offense by
resting a pint of beer on the tiny coffin of one of his sons.
</P>
<P>
   With due respect to the pain that is described here, the film
isn't wrenching enough to do it justice. The family's suffering,
like the carefully mottled paint on supposedly run-down walls, is
curiously unreal.
</P>
<P>
   For all the scenes in which Angela, with her children in tow,
endures shame and humiliation (``Beggars can't be choosers, Mrs.
McCourt,'' she is literally told when trying to find furniture),
there is a safe and even self-congratulatory predictability in the
film's idea of hardship.
</P>
<P>
   Even the father's drunkenness is somehow sugar-coated, with a
lot of reproachful lines of dialogue (``You drank the money, didn't
you?'' Angela asks while peeling potatoes) and little of the angry,
erratic behavior that goes with this territory.
</P>
<P>
   If Carlyle seems tepid at such times, perhaps that's because
Stephen Rea played nearly the same role with such frightening,
mercurial brilliance for Neil Jordan in ``The Butcher Boy.'' In a
nutshell, the prodigiously talented Jordan (``The End of the
Affair''), with his ability to fuse enchantment and tragedy, is
what ``Angela's Ashes'' is missing.
</P>
<P>
   Among the scenes recreated here with varying degrees of
authenticity are young Frank's experiences with Roman Catholic
clergymen and teachers (believably captured) to his sexual
coming-of-age at the absolute insistence of a beautiful, available
young woman (preposterous as filmed, even if it really happened).
</P>
<P>
   Details like a sheep's head for Christmas dinner, or the McCourt
family's being forced to live downwind of the neighborhood
outhouse, are among those that prompt ``Angela's Ashes'' to make
the deplorable and the sentimental one and the same.

   IN A RECTORY ATTIC, A DEL SARTO
</P>
<P>
   In the early decades of this century, Clara Winthrop, a
parishioner at All Saints Episcopal Church in West Newbury, Mass.,
bequeathed a painting of a Madonna and Child to the church. Until
recently, officials at All Saints thought it was a copy of a work
by Andrea del Sarto, the Italian old master painter and draftsman,
and that it dated from around 1800.
</P>
<P>
   The painting, an oil on panel, hung in the choir stall until
about 20 years ago, when it was stored in the rectory attic.
Curious to know exactly what they had, church officials called in
Christopher Apostle, senior vice president in the old master
paintings department at Sotheby's, to examine the painting.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the old documents said it was a copy, when I saw the
painting I realized it was high-quality and from the 16th
century,'' Apostle said.
</P>
<P>
   He called in scholars, and together they examined the painting
with infrared reflectography, a method that reveals the drawing
beneath the painting's surface. All the experts agreed ``Madonna
and Child'' was painted by del Sarto.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Sotheby's in New York plans to auction the ``Madonna and
Child'' on Jan. 28. The painting is expected to bring $1 million to
$1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Del Sarto was a great proponent of drawing, and the
underdrawings were typical of the way he worked,'' Apostle said.
Examining the painting with infrared equipment, the experts saw
evidence of del Sarto's method. He was known for first making a
detailed, full-size drawing, then blackening the back of it with
carbon. He pinned the drawing to a panel as if were like tracing
paper, then used a stylus to trace the design onto the panel before
painting.
</P>
<P>
   A preparatory drawing for the head of the Madonna is in the
National Gallery of Art in Washington. The painting's composition,
Apostle said, is similar to several versions by the artist, of
which the best-known is in the permanent collection of the National
Gallery of Canada in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   In the work Sotheby's is selling, the Virgin stands behind a
parapet holding a book in her right hand and supporting the infant
Christ with the other. As in the version in Ottawa, the viewer can
see where the artist changed his mind. The position of the child's
fingers, for example, has been visibly altered. ``This discovery is
significant in the old master world,'' Apostle said. ``Del Sartos
don't come up every day.''
</P>
<P>
   SHISEIDO GIFT TO NYU
</P>
<P>
   The Grey Art Gallery at New York University has received a
$500,000 gift from Shiseido, the Japanese cosmetics company, for
its endowment. At the same time the gallery is planning ``Face to
Face: Shiseido Japan 1900-2000,'' an exhibition of the company's
collection of posters, products and package designs, along with its
fine and decorative arts holdings, that explores how the history of
makeup reflects cultural and societal changes in Japan. In addition
to its $500,000 gift, Shiseido is paying for the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   The ethics of museum fund-raising have been a sensitive issue
lately, especially with the debate surrounding the Brooklyn Museum
of Art's ``Sensations'' show, which involves art owned by a single
collector, Charles Saatchi. He contributed $160,000 toward the
exhibition, and many people say the show will increase the value of
his art.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum announced that it
would mount a major retrospective of fashions by Giorgio Armani
that is to be sponsored by In Style, a magazine in which Armani
advertises. Eight months earlier the Guggenheim had reached what it
calls a ``global partner sponsorship arrangement'' with Armani,
something it did not mention when the show was announced. The
fashion company is reported to have given the museum $5 million and
promised $10 million more over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing comments by Guggenheim officials, Lynn Gumpert, director
of the Grey Art Gallery, says she would have organized the Shiseido
show regardless of the company's donation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with experts who say you have to be extremely careful
because you don't want to compromise the integrity of the programs
at the Grey or mission of the institution,'' she said. ``But I am
convinced this is not the case. The material from Shiseido is
fantastic. It traces the history of how Western culture and art was
imported to Japan, bringing up issues of gender and of how one
perceives beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gumpert said the budget for the show had yet to be
determined. ``They did a similar show at the Musee des Arts
Decoratifs in Paris three years ago, which Shiseido also paid
for,'' she added. The money for the gallery's endowment is the
``first really sizable gift we've had for the endowment in 25
years,'' she said. ``It was given to celebrate Shiseido's 10th
anniversary in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   NEW CURATOR AT MOMA
</P>
<P>
   For months there have been rumors that Gary Garrels, the chief
curator and curator of painting and sculpture at the San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art, was trying to choose between job offers from
the Whitney Museum of American Art and Museum of Modern Art, both
in New York. Last week the Modern announced his appointment: in
April, Garrels is to become the Modern's chief curator of drawings
and a curator of painting and sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in San Francisco said they planned an international
search for his replacement.
</P>
<P>
   SHOW LEAVES ARMORY
</P>
<P>
   A so-called armory show will no longer be held at an armory. The
International Fair of New Art, which was first held in February at
the 69th Regiment Armory at Lexington Avenue and 26th Street in
Manhattan, has grown so big that its second version will be held at
the North Pavilion, at 11th Avenue and 39th Street, a new structure
at the north end of the Javits Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the dealers wanted big booths to best show off the
works,'' said Tom Delavan, director of the fair, who added that the
pavilion's proximity to Chelsea was a big factor in choosing the
new site.

ALBUM OF THE WEEK: RODNEY WHITAKER QUINTET'S `BALLADS AND BLUES' 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)

<P>
   Album of the Week &QL;
</P>
<P>
   RODNEY WHITAKER QUINTET: ``Ballads and Blues: The Brooklyn
Session'' (Criss Cross).
</P>
<P>
   The first two albums by Rodney Whitaker, the bassist for the
Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, were valentines to his hometown,
Detroit; he surrounded himself with players he had known before
moving to New York, mixing them in with his new colleagues. The
albums were ambitious and a little unwieldy and often lost focus
and balance with so many different kinds of players.
</P>
<P>
   But his third, ``Ballads and Blues,'' has a streamlined,
economized sound, the benefit of players who know one another. It
includes some of the best young musicians in jazz: the saxophonist
Ron Blake, the vibraphonist Stefon Harris, the pianist Eric Reed
and the drummer Carl Allen. Although Whitaker has included a number
of songs by bassists _ three by Paul Chambers, one by George
Duvivier _ it's not a thematic record. The album has the ring of
the late '50s and early '60s, when great jazz musicians were under
contract to produce several albums a year, and a huge number of
high-quality records that weren't particularly high-concept were
recorded, thus creating the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   The jazz mainstream has two aspects: there's the flat and the
dull, and then there's a form of comfort within traditional
language that allows musicians to let themselves go, which is what
happens here. Allen fills his sound with cymbal-heavy swing; Blake
plays long, connected, rapid lines that accrue an intellectual
weight as they go along; Harris steps out of rhythm to play dots of
sound in strange intervals; and Reed, an alert player, gets into
tumbling waves of rolled chords.
</P>
<P>
   The trombonist Wycliffe Gordon shows up on a few tracks, too,
chattering his solos and using a mute to sound like a singer. The
current anxiety emanating from jazz records _ the need to make a
new sound stick, the dips into stylized retro, the nervous desire
to connect with pop _ is, to our pleasure, nowhere to be found
here.

<P>
   THE TALKING WILL CONTINUE
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be no end to ``The Vagina Monologues,'' and come
February the lone voice of Eve Ensler may be replaced by a
star-filled ensemble of some her biggest fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monologues,'' the provocative show about the majesty and
mystery of that eponymous body part, was tentatively scheduled to
close at the Westside Theater on Jan. 23, when Ms. Ensler, its
creator and sole performer, leaves to work on a new play. But a
production member, who has been part of negotiations, said the show
would continue, assisted by a roster of actresses including Winona
Ryder, Rosie Perez and Gillian Anderson, of ``X-Files'' fame.
</P>
<P>
   David Stone, the producer, would not comment on specific plans
for the show, but he confirmed that several options _ and actors _
were being considered. The production member said the show would
probably reopen, appropriately, around Valentine's Day, and would
feature sets of three women. Each woman will perform a handful of
the piece's 14 monologues. Each group will stay in the show for two
weeks. Twenty percent of the proceeds are to go to V-Day, a charity
that contributes to a variety of women's causes.
</P>
<P>
   The new undertaking will be heavy on feminine star power,
attracted by the show's popularity among women as well as the
relative ease of a two-week commitment (a form of commitment long
popular with the male of the species). Other actresses who have
been in discussions for two-week stints include Marisa Tomei, Kathy
Najimy, Marlo Thomas, Amy Irving, Andrea Martin, Gina Gershon,
Shirley Knight, Ricki Lake and Kristen Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   SHORT RUN IN `INCH'
</P>
<P>
   The post-mortem was continuing this week on the short, troubled
tenure of Ally Sheedy in the musical ``Hedwig and the Angry Inch.''
Ms. Sheedy left the show after Saturday's performance, roughly six
weeks before her contract was to expire. Producers said the
decision was mutual; but reached at her home on Tuesday, Ms. Sheedy
seemed upset by the experience. But she had little comment on the
circumstances. ``I'm just trying to get through all of this,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In September Ms. Sheedy took on the part of Hedwig, a catty
transvestite and overlooked East German rock star. The move was
risky for the show, as Ms. Sheedy had little singing experience and
was the first woman to try a role written for a man. Those fears
were confirmed when she received mixed reviews, and ticket sales
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Her manager, Neil Koenigsberg, said later that Ms. Sheedy had
enjoyed her stay with the show. ``They hired her, and she went
onstage,'' he said. ``She had fun.'' Matt McGrath, who was an
understudy for the role in Los Angeles, has taken it over in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   As for the show itself, at the Jane Street Theater, there are
reports that it may soon wind down its nearly two-year run, perhaps
by February. (The Los Angeles production closed last week.) Susanne
Brinkley, a producer of ``Hedwig,'' denied that any date had been
set but cautioned that ``like any show that's been running for a
long time, we're always looking at the show's sales and health.''
</P>
<P>
   THAT BUSY NATHAN LANE
</P>
<P>
   With plans for a springtime production of ``Wise Guys,'' the new
Stephen Sondheim musical, postponed indefinitely, the cast has been
looking for work. But when you're Nathan Lane, that doesn't take
long.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in June Lane will be appearing at the newly
refurbished Selwyn Theater in the Roundabout Theater Co.'s
production of ``The Man Who Came to Dinner,'' the wicked 1939
comedy by Moss Hart and George S. Kaufman. Lane, who has been known
to inspire a giggle or two, will be playing Sheridan Whiteside, the
irascible New York writer and critic (of all things) who fractures
his hip on the front steps of an Ohio family's home and proceeds to
make the family miserable for the rest of the play. (His opening
line? ``I may vomit.'') Monty Woolley originated the role.
</P>
<P>
   Lane said that after the disappointment of ``Wise Guys'' he
needed a little comedy. ``It's the perfect job,'' he said of his
new role. ``I just sit in a wheelchair and yell at people.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Zaks will direct.
</P>
<P>
   HIP-HOP SHAKESPEARE
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare wasn't the first choice for the gang of student
rappers behind ``Bomb-itty of Errors,'' a hip-hop adaptation of
``Comedy of Errors.'' They originally thought of doing Kafka.
</P>
<P>
   ``I brought in `The Trial,''' said Jordan Allen-Dutton, 22. ``It
didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was Shakespeare who got bomb-ittyed instead. The idea was
Gregory J. Qaiyum's. He started the enterprise as an independent
project at New York University's Experimental Theater Wing. Qaiyum,
23, gathered four collaborators: Allen-Dutton, Jason Catalano, Erik
Weiner and Jeffrey Qaiyum, his brother, all of whom were students
at New York University. (Jeffrey, 20, still is.)
</P>
<P>
   Working on a slapdash schedule of midnight-to-dawn rehearsals,
they translated the iambic vernacular into modern language and set
it to hip-hop's rhyming couplets. (A suitor to his love: ``I'll
serenade ya in Spanish, woo you in Swahili,/Ask you in German,
``Was ist die dealy?'')
</P>
<P>
   ``The first full run-through was opening night,'' said Weiner,
22. ``It was rough. But our teachers said, `You're on to
something.'''
</P>
<P>
   Since that first showing in May 1998 ``Bomb-itty'' has traveled
north to a developmental production in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., picked
up a bushel of prominent producers (including Daryl Roth, Hal
Luftig and Michael Lynne) and has leapt to a full off-Broadway run
at the Salon, a spanking new theater at 45 Bleecker St. in the East
Village.
</P>
<P>
   And while the reviews have been mixed, the show has been drawing
large audiences of young theatergoers. ``We get generally two sets
of audience members,'' said Mr. Catalano. ``Those that expect a
play, and those that expect a concert. We try to please both.''
</P>
<P>
   No word, or word up, on the group's next project, but
Shakespeare may be in for it again. ``Maybe `M.C. Beth,''' Weiner
said with a laugh. ``Or `Jamlet.'''

 &HT;    Mad dash begins to exchange those less-than-perfect gifts
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The blue cardigan sweater from Aunt Martha is:
</P>
<P>
   _ The wrong size.
</P>
<P>
   _ Identical to the one she gave you last year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Definitely not your style.
</P>
<P>
   _ All of the above.
</P>
<P>
   So chances are you'll be heading to the store, package in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Returns and exchanges aren't the most exciting part of the
holiday season, but there are ways to make the transactions go more
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a return speedier if tags are attached to the
garment,'' says Susie Tokasey, assistant store manager at Stein
Mart. ``Once they've been removed, we'll have to verify the ticket
with the merchandise, which means calling the department.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the price tag has been removed, the identifying
merchandise number may still be intact.
</P>
<P>
   Tokasey says many of today's gift-givers include receipts with
their gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing a lot more receipts coming back,'' she says.
``Customers realize if you don't have the receipt you'll receive
the current selling price and after Christmas most things are
reduced.''
</P>
<P>
   She suggests that those who feel awkward including a receipt
offer to return the gift themselves.
</P>
<P>
   During the holidays, most stores will take back items _ even if
they haven't been purchased locally _ as long as its merchandise
sold in the store.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we own it in our inventory, we will take it back,'' says
Dan Bukey, vice president and regional director of stores for
Elder-Beerman, who adds that sales staff is increased in the weeks
before and after Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Customers who aren't exchanging a size may want to postpone
their returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most stores have a 30-day return policy, so if you're not in a
rush, why put yourself through the headache of waiting in line?''
asks one toy store sales manager. At a toy store, he explains, it's
especially important for all boxes and packaging to be returned
with the item.
</P>
<P>
   Tokasey says most stores view returns as an opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times people will bring things back to exchange or
return and find more things and spend more money,'' she says.
``It's an opportunity for us to increase sales.''
</P>
<P>
   For some customers, the return experience can turn out to be a
windfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inevitably, someone might get two of the same Pokemon thing
and bring one back,'' he says. ``Perhaps it's something that
someone else couldn't find before Christmas!''
</P>
<P>
   TO MAKE EXCHANGES LESS FRUSTRATING:
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep all tags, packaging and instructions and return them with
the merchandise. When possible, have the receipt as well.
</P>
<P>
   _ Check the return policy of the store. Most allow 30 days for
returns and exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you don't have a receipt, expect to receive the current
selling value of the merchandise. Without the receipt, you'll
probably receive a store credit. Be certain to note the expiration
date of the credit.
</P>
<P>
   _ Be patient. Remember that store clerks are weary, too.

   A ROYAL HAIRCUT
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Bai Ling walked into the Urth Cafe, a trendy coffee
shop on Melrose Avenue, and lifted her dark eyes and improbable
cheekbones into the air as if savoring the scents of chai tea and
cappuccino. But it was her hair that was on her mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to cut it all off; it was very difficult,'' said Ms.
Ling, the Chinese-born actress who plays a crucial supporting role
as the king's youngest and unfaithful wife in the recently released
``Anna and the King.'' She patted her head every few seconds,
feeling for the curls that wrapped around her ears and almost
willing the four-inch locks to grow faster. ``Before the movie I
had hair so long that I could sit on it,'' she said. ``Down to
here. I like to look beautiful and sexy. But for the movie it had
to all come off. I never felt so naked.''
</P>
<P>
   It is never easy for actors whose native language is not English
to carve careers for themselves in Hollywood, where they are often
relegated to villain or femme fatale roles. For every Arnold
Schwarzenegger who pulls it off, there are a dozen Gerard
Depardieus who give it a go and then head back home.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ling, who lives on the water at Marina Del Rey (``I must be
near the ocean,'' she said), described her unlikely journey from an
impoverished urban upbringing in southwest China through a stint in
the army in Tibet to movie stardom in China, then a move to New
York University and several years of working as a hostess in
restaurants or as a newscaster on Chinese-language cable stations.
</P>
<P>
   It was her casting as a Chinese lawyer in ``Red Corner,'' a
Richard Gere thriller about an American businessman framed for
murder, that brought her to Hollywood and eventually led to the
current role.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Anna and the King'' her character chops off all her hair
and tries to pass as a monk to be near the young man she loves, who
ran off to the monastery when she was forcibly married to the king.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my agent told me that I would need to cut off my hair for
the movie, I thought: `What? Why?''' she remembered. ``Do they want
me to play the Yul Brynner part?'' But she agreed to do it, she
said, when the role was described to her. And it turned out to be a
wonderful experience, outside of the hair thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do no preparation for my acting, none for my scenes,'' she
said. ``I just keep this very peaceful and calm place inside of me
that I can go to and the emotions come through my face.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Tennant, who directed ``Anna and the King,'' vividly
remembered the struggle to have the movie's massive sets completed
in the Malaysian countryside after the government of Thailand
decided not to allow the company to film in the country where the
story is set. For the director of such relatively smaller films as
``Ever After,'' starring Drew Barrymore, this movie multiplied
complications by a factor of 10, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The first day's shoot was a parade down the main street as Anna
and her son are taken by carriage to the Siamese royal palace.
``The call sheet was 20 pages long,'' Tennant said. ``I mean, the
elephants had a 3 a.m. call.'' And when local children spooked one
of the elephants, it bolted, was cornered and eventually sat down
on a parked car.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the first day,'' Tennant said. ``I thought, `Uh-oh,
what have I gotten myself into?' But fortunately, it went fine
after that.''
</P>
<P>
   The sets were so massive that work continued even as the movie
was shooting; the royal palace was not completed until the film was
practically finished. People hired to fix up the gardens were
simply dressed up as 19th-century Thai gardeners and sent to work
in the background of other shots. ``Otherwise we never would have
gotten done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also vividly recalled the scorching day he filmed one of the
movie's most difficult scenes, in which Ms. Ling and her young
lover are tied to posts before an angry crowd. That's the scene
that stands out in Ms. Ling's memory, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very hot,'' she said. ``The sun was making me woozy,
and the wooden platform was burning my feet and my legs. It was
like sunburn: the skin was coming off.'' One of her major
close-ups, she said, was filmed in just one take. ``I said to Andy:
`Are you sure? Do you not want one more take? What if the film is
not right?' But he said, no, it was perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ling rubbed her head for the 50th time, making sure that her
hair was actually growing back.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it was a good scene in the movie,'' she said. ``In my face
you could see the misery. This is because I was feeling misery.''
</P>
<P>
   SWAGGER IS A MUST
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Foxx was taking a leisurely final run-through of a
forthcoming episode of his eponymous television series. The series'
main sets _ a hotel lobby, an office, an apartment _ are lined up
before a half-dozen rows of seats where the studio audience will
eventually sit. Foxx and his fellow actors go through the episode
scene by scene, moving back and forth among the sets as their
producers, writers and assorted crew members follow them, forth,
carting stools and canvas chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward Foxx sat back in one of the greenrooms on the Warner
Brothers lot, where his series is taped, and talked about football
and his hopes for an acting career that extends beyond the sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Oliver Stone, you know, is a diabolical genius,'' Foxx said
with a knowing glance. ``He was always coming up and feeding ideas
to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Foxx, best known as a comic actor, was delighted when he was
chosen by Stone to play an important role in the director's
football drama ``Any Given Sunday.'' In a star-heavy ensemble cast
that includes James Woods, Dennis Quaid, Cameron Diaz, Ann-Margret,
James Brown, Matthew Modine and Charlton Heston, Foxx is a standout
as a brash young quarterback who forges an angry relationship with
the movie's central character, a down-on-his-luck coach played by
Al Pacino.
</P>
<P>
   It was a little intimidating sometimes to play scenes with
actors with the intensity that Pacino, Brown and the others bring
to a scene. ``But that was only while we were shooting,'' Foxx
said. ``After the scene, Al would be so nice and calm. He really
went out of his way. It felt like this generational thing to me,
teaching the young guy how to do it, and I really appreciated it.''
</P>
<P>
   Foxx had been a quarterback in high school in northern Texas, so
he knew a little bit about the swagger and the leadership needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I had to do was to work out and get in shape and put some
attitude with the moves,'' he said. ``I needed to change those high
school moves into professional moves.''
</P>
<P>
   TRUTH WARD
</P>
<P>
   James Mangold said he was interested in directing the movie
adaptation of Susanna Kaysen's memoir, ``Girl, Interrupted,''
because its setting, a mental hospital ward, and its ensemble cast
would allow him to ``return to some of the intimate energy of my
first film.''
</P>
<P>
   Mangold moved from his first film, the critically praised
``Heavy,'' to a somewhat larger canvas with ``Copland,'' which had
a cast that included Sylvester Stallone, Harvey Keitel and Ray
Liotta. In all of his films, he said, he insists on having the
actors, even the top stars, in as many shots as possible, even if
they are just standing in the background. He describes it as
``shooting stars in ways that aren't starlike.'' It gives the movie
a more truthful flavor, Mangold said.
</P>
<P>
   This was one reason that Winona Ryder approached him to direct
``Girl, Interrupted,'' he said. ``I felt that she was interested in
me for the right reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   He was intent on shooting the movie on location somewhere,
rather than building a hospital set at the studio and having the
actors all go home at the end of the day. Finally he located an
empty hospital in Harrisburg, Pa., which was transformed into the
institution where Ms. Ryder's character goes in the late 1960s
after a suicide attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was shot on an actual ward,'' he said. ``When they were not
in a scene, the actresses could go back to their own character's
room to rest and read. And there is something to be said for
looking out the window and seeing the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change from the book was the expansion of the role
of a cunning sociopath, played by Angelina Jolie. In the movie she
becomes first the idol and then the nemesis of Ms. Ryder's
seemingly more fragile character. The interplay between the two
became the key to the movie's dramatic arc, Mangold said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all wish we could be that gutsy and insane and get away
with it,'' he said. ``And we know people _ we all have come across
people in life _ who do seem to be able to get away with it.''

`THE TALENTED RIPLEY': CARNAL, GLAMOROUS AND WORTH THE PRICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review) 
(jt)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A flood of adjectives bursts onto the screen at the start of
Anthony Minghella's glittering new thriller, considering ways to
describe Tom Ripley before settling on ``talented'' as le mot
juste. This is only a minuscule show of ingenuity, but it's also a
promise that the film will keep. ``The Talented Ripley'' offers
diabolically smart surprises wherever you care to look.
</P>
<P>
   Its opening credit sequence alone is a model of exquisitely
economical suggestion, showing how the loan of a jacket with a
Princeton insignia leads Tom from the life of a New York City men's
room attendant to a thrillingly new world of opportunity. In a rush
of gorgeous, agile exposition, Tom winds up in Europe, learning to
say ``This is my face'' in Italian as he trains his binoculars on
Dickie Greenleaf. Dickie is the spectacularly charismatic
dilettante whose life Tom will eventually steal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you, the Greenleaf name opens a lot of doors,''
remarks the chauffeur who drives Tom away from a bleak Manhattan
neighborhood and hands him his first-class ticket for an ocean
passage. In light of the mind games that the movie has in store,
both the remark and the carnal high-low contrast (meat hangs on
hooks near the limousine) are as splendidly barbed as they can be.
</P>
<P>
   As a playwright and television writer who came to filmmaking
with two comparatively modest, whimsical efforts (``Truly, Madly,
Deeply'' and `` Wonderful'') before the exponential leap of ``The
English Patient,'' Minghella now establishes that his Oscar-winning
triumph was no fluke. His hypnotic, sensually charged adaptation of
Patricia Highsmith's fascinatingly reptilian murder story has the
same kind of complex allure that made ``The English Patient'' so
mesmerizing.
</P>
<P>
   This is a more conventional opportunity, being essentially the
story of a homoerotic Faustian bargain played for keeps. But
Minghella, who wrote and directed ``The Talented Ripley'' with
acute attention to every nuance, significantly broadens what Ms.
Highsmith had in mind. Adding a couple of important new characters
and bringing the secrets of Tom's sexual longings to the surface,
he risks losing the profound chill that made Ripley so disturbing
in the first place. The character is several shades less loathsome
and more conscience-stricken than he was to begin with, and his
homosexuality is more openly expressed. But as played by Matt Damon
with a fine, tricky mix of obsequiousness and ruthlessness, the
nicer new Ripley is in no danger of losing his sting.
</P>
<P>
   In a scenic, voluptuously beautiful film (kudos to the
cinematographer, John Seale) that has a traffic-stopping cast,
Minghella carefully plants the seeds of mayhem. When Tom is hired
by Dickie's father (James Rebhorn) to bring the ne'er-do-well
Greenleaf scion home from Italy, he contrives to bump into Dickie
on the beach and to echo Dickie's infatuation with American jazz.
The year is 1958, and it seems an impossibly glamorous time as
depicted among pampered American expatriates in some of Italy's
most breathtaking settings.
</P>
<P>
   Tom's tricks, from wearing an embarrassingly skimpy chartreuse
bathing suit to casually flashing some of Dickie's favorite record
albums, neatly accomplish their purpose. Soon he has made himself
Dickie's latest diversion, and managed this without even alienating
Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow), Dickie's girlfriend. Marge was a thick,
lumpen target for Tom's misogyny in Ms. Highsmith's version. Here,
though still hopelessly oblivious to sexual currents between the
men, she becomes a reminder that Ms. Paltrow makes as savvy a
character actress as she does a swanlike leading lady.
</P>
<P>
   A word about the film's Dickie Greenleaf: this is a star-making
role for the preternaturally talented English actor Jude Law.
Beyond being devastatingly good-looking, Law gives Dickie the
manic, teasing powers of manipulation that make him ardently
courted by every man or woman he knows. During the first half of
the film, Dickie is pure eros and adrenaline, a combination not
many actors could handle with this much aplomb.
</P>
<P>
   During one especially sharp-edged scene here, as the tensions
surrounding Dickie approach the unbearable, the handsome heir
indulges in what he dismissively calls ``Marge maintenance'' on his
sailboat. Leaving Tom and another rich crony, Freddie Miles (Philip
Seymour Hoffman, scene-stealingly wonderful here), to wait uneasily
during this sexual interlude, Dickie avidly plays off each
passenger on the boat against the others. Something has to give.
</P>
<P>
   When it does, in the deadly encounter that sends Tom Ripley into
his new life, the film changes greatly in tone. Once its touristy
idyll is over, ``The Talented Ripley'' becomes an elaborate round
of gamesmanship about Tom's sleight-of-hand and how it can be
sustained. The ruse, which Damon handles coyly and credibly, if not
with the nascent Norman Bates streak that the situation warrants,
is given an added complication by the presence of Meredith Logue.
Meredith is a needy post-debutante played irresistibly by Cate
Blanchett. Once Meredith latches onto Tom, who she thinks is
Dickie, whom she regards as a bored and wealthy kindred spirit, the
story has developed all the dizzying cross-currents it deserves.
</P>
<P>
   The last part of the film runs into problems. Eventually tangled
up, like Tom, in the particulars of a trail of crime, it tries to
use yet another of Tom's attractions (to another new character,
played by Peter Smith-Kingsley) to settle his fate. And despite the
occasional flash of Hitchcockian magic _ like a scene involving a
razor blade in the pocket of a white bathrobe _ there are late
scenes that flounder or lag.
</P>
<P>
   These concluding events are far less meaningful than the ones
that sent Tom on his odyssey of self-invention in the first place.
As with any great impostor, there's more to say about where he came
from than where he has to go.

NEWS FLASH! BIG FOOT SPOTTED IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Friday, Dec. 24) 
(lh) 
 By DAVID GRIMES    
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As if China didn't have enough problems already, what with all
those human-rights protesters gumming up its tank-treads and
everything, an 8-foot-tall, red-haired, corn-loving Big Foot was
recently spotted in the province of Hubei.
</P>
<P>
   The story comes from Chinese ``state media,'' so when I say
``recently,'' I am actually talking about something that happened
two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Two months is a long time when you're talking about a hairy
8-foot creature with 16-inch footprints that goes through cobs of
corn they way the rest of us go through salted peanuts. The Chinese
Big Foot might be running the country now, for all we Westerners
know, or at the very least started a corn-fritter franchise or a
chain of hair salons catering to women seeking that stringy, matted
look.
</P>
<P>
   I worry about the Chinese Big Foot, not so much because he (she?
it?) doesn't speak the language (Big-Foot speech, from what I've
read, basically consists of hooting the letter ``u'' over and over
again), but because the Chinese are not as likely to elevate a
stinky, 8-foot ape with corn-breath to the same celebrity status
that we Americans would.
</P>
<P>
   In America, Big Foot, better known as ``Sasquatch'' (literally:
hairy giant creature that's failed to master consonants), is
immensely popular, especially for something that almost surely
doesn't exist. Sasquatch not only enjoys better name-recognition
than most of the presidential candidates, it is also
better-regarded, which is rather sad given the fact that Sasquatch
is said to enjoy a little leg-o'-human every now and then.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds, if not thousands, of articles have been written about
Sasquatch, one of the more comprehensive being an article by David
Brewster that ran in Seattle Magazine in 1970. (The same year I
graduated from high school; it has been all downhill for me ever
since but Sasquatch's career has really taken off.)
</P>
<P>
   I learned many interesting things about Sasquatch from
Brewster's article, over and above the fact that Big Foot (Big
Feet?) speaks in the kind of monosyllabic slur one normally
associates with teen-age boys.
</P>
<P>
   One thing I didn't know is that Sasquatches can live to be 200
years old, possibly due to their largely vegetarian diet.
(Leg-o'-humans are reserved for special occasions, such as the
occasion where a human wanders close enough to be grabbed.)
</P>
<P>
   Sasquatches also aren't real big in the personal-hygiene
department (another thing they have in common with teen-age boys).
</P>
<P>
   Brewster recounts the story of Warren Scott, a 37-year-old
Seattle man who was camping (alone, of course) near Vancouver in
1961:
</P>
<P>
   ``Late at night, a Sasquatch kidnapped (Scott) and carried him
70 miles. During the journey, Scott was almost suffocated by the
creature's vise-like grip and uremic odor. Eventually, he was
carried through a long tunnel and dumped in a cave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of Scott's ordeal was spent in this hot, fire-lit
enclosure. The mother (Sasquatch) took care of him, bringing him
food (greens and inedible chunks of raw meat); the old man
(Sasquatch) was seldom around.
</P>
<P>
   ```I was treated like a pet,' Scott recalled. He endured some
good-natured whacking on the rump, he was watched intently when
passing wastes, and he engaged in some rock-rolling with the
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which suggests to me that Sasquatches are really nothing
more than overgrown frat boys, the kind that John Belushi (rest his
soul) played to perfection in ``Animal House.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the Chinese find out that their Sasquatch enjoys peeping in
coed's windows, dragging dead horses into the dean's office and
stuffing it's face full of corn until it resembles a giant zit,
they may wish it had stayed in the decadent West, where it belongs.

 &HT;    Marshall tragedy now a triumph
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTINGTON, W.Va. _ Marshall University football coach Bob
Pruett fought back tears of sadness and joy as he addressed the
crowd of more than 500 people in front of the Memorial Fountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know those guys are looking down and sayin, `Way to go,' to
those who stuck it out and made Marshall what it is now,'' Pruett
said on a breezy Sunday afternoon last month. ``From the ashes of
the plane crash to where we are today is a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Unbeaten and ranked No. 11, Marshall is the improbable winner of
a college-best 113 football games this decade. On Monday, the
Thundering Herd plays No. 25 Brigham Young in the Motor City Bowl
in Pontiac, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   But as important as that game is to Marshall as it tries to
complete a 13-0 season and move into the Top 10 for the first time,
the defining date in the school's football history always will be
Nov. 14, 1970.
</P>
<P>
   On that dreary Saturday night, the chartered plane carrying a
3-6 Marshall football team home from a 17-14 loss at East Carolina
crashed into a hillside as it approached Tri-State Airport outside
Huntington. All aboard were killed in what remains the worst air
tragedy in American team sports.
</P>
<P>
   But Marshall football didn't die in that crash, although it was
on life support during more than a decade of losing seasons. Today,
tragedy has been turned into triumph, ashes have been turned into
glory.
</P>
<P>
   In Huntington, an aging city of about 50,000 on the Ohio River,
each victory is to be cherished more because of what came before.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we came here, we really didn't understand the
significance,'' quarterback Chad Pennington said. Pennington, who
finished fourth in the Heisman Trophy voting, is expected to be the
first quarterback taken in the NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``But after awhile, you do (understand),'' Pennington said.
``Every time we go out on the field, we're not only doing it for
ourselves, we're doing it for the community and everyone who died
on that plane.''
</P>
<P>
   The 75 iron prongs on the 13-foot high Memorial Fountain
represent the number of players, coaches and Marshall supporters
who died. As the memorial service closes each Nov. 14th, the water
is shut off _ not to be turned on again until the start of the next
school year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about death; it's what can come from death,'' said
Andre O'Neal, senior linebacker and co-captain and one of six
Marshall players from metro Atlanta. ``We are celebrating the lives
of those who died. Our success has come from their loss.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that sense of purpose and commitment that helped Marshall
overcome a 23-point deficit against Western Michigan in the
Mid-American Conference title game and prompted Pruett to turn down
a lucrative job offer from the University of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only one person in America who would have turned down
that money,'' Pennington said about the six-year Houston deal worth
a reported $8.9 million. ``That's coach Pruett. He loves Marshall
and West Virginia that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Pruett, 56, was born in Beckley, W.Va., and graduated in 1965
from Marshall, also the alma mater of his wife, Elsie. He said he
seriously considered the Houston offer but couldn't tear himself
away from Marshall. At least not now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any of you will be asking me for financial
advice,'' Pruett joked as he and Pennington were greeted by about
300 fans when they returned home from the Heisman ceremonies in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people talk about loyalty, but coach Pruett stood up
for it when he turned down all that money,'' Marshall fan Barry
Brownfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Pruett, a former University of Florida defensive coordinator who
was named Marshall coach after Jim Donnan left for the University
of Georgia, has a base salary of $132,000 per year, plus a $1
million annuity. Recently, a $1,000-a-plate dinner was held to pay
off his house mortgage, and Coach Bobby Pruett's Steakhouse opened
this year in Huntington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marshall needs to show its appreciation to coach Pruett,''
Pennington said. ``Coaches like him don't grow on trees. If he
left, it would be devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnan was 64-21 in six seasons at Marshall, leading the
Thundering Herd to the NCAA Division I-AA national title in 1992
and making the title game two other times.
</P>
<P>
   But Marshall has been even better since Donnan left. It made the
jump to Division I without a hitch after going 15-0 and winning the
I-AA title in 1996 _ the first season for Pruett and Randy Moss.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall is 34-4 in Division I and has won three Mid-American
Conference titles in a row. Marshall, 12-1 last season, has won 16
consecutive games and hasn't lost at home in 31 games, both
national bests. Moss, now a star with the Minnesota Vikings,
finished fifth in the Heisman Trophy voting in 1997, and Pennington
was a finalist this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Marshall _ one of three unbeaten major-college teams this
season _ has had trouble getting national respect. Like unbeaten
Tulane last season, Marshall is not part of the Bowl Championship
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State and Virginia Tech, the other unbeaten teams, will
battle for the national title in the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 4. Marshall
had to settle for its third-straight trip to the low-paying Motor
City Bowl. And it would have been left out of a bowl all together
if it had not rallied to win the Mid-American Conference title
game. Pennington threw a short touchdown pass with four seconds
left to beat Western Michigan 34-30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I think we should be ranked in the Top 10?'' Pruett asked.
``Yes. Do I think we deserve to be in a bigger bowl? Sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``But all we are thinking about is beating BYU. They are ranked
and have a great tradition. Beating them should get us in the Top
10 and help make people take us more seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 25 BYU is the first ranked team Marshall has played this
season. But the Herd did beat Peach Bowl-bound Clemson 10-7 in the
season opener.
</P>
<P>
   Clemson also lost to Florida State (17-14) and to Virginia Tech
(31-11).
</P>
<P>
   ``Marshall has more good players than some people think,'' said
Clemson's Tommy Bowden, who coached Tulane to its unbeaten season
last year. ``Do they have the depth to beat FSU or Virginia Tech? I
don't know, but it would be fun to see them play and find out.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that won't happen. Not this year. Not without a
playoff system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trapped in the world of the BCS,'' Marshall defensive
tackle Giradie Mercer said. ``Sure, I think we could play with FSU
and Virginia Tech. But where we're ranked bothers our fans more
than it does us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Summers, a Marshall fan who lives in Atlanta, was so
outraged when the Herd didn't crack the Top 10 polls released Nov.
14 _ the crash anniversary _ that he sent e-mails across the United
States calling for a boycott of sponsors of the BCS bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Herd deserves better and those who died on that plane
deserve better,'' he wrote. ``Stand up and fight.''
</P>
<P>
   It is because of that fierce loyalty that Marshall's 30,000-seat
stadium is packed for most games. For next season, the capacity
will be increased to about 40,000. Pruett hopes the increase will
enable Marshall to upgrade its home schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Next season, Marshall opens at Michigan State, then plays at
North Carolina. Trips to Virginia Tech and Georgia are on future
schedules. But what Pruett and Marshall fans really want is a
home-and-home series with state rival West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, Marshall will have to be content with home games
against Mid-American Conference teams Bowling Green, Toledo and
Miami of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Before the homecoming game this season, a candlelight march was
held from Spring Hill Cemetery to the stadium. From the monument
honoring the crash victims on the top of the hill, you can see the
campus below. Six players whose bodies could not be identified are
buried under the marker in a communal grave.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very moving,'' Marshall fan Mike Captain said about the
candlelight march. ``Those who died will never be forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Captain was a reserve on the 1971 team that won Marshall's first
home game after the crash. The Herd beat Xavier 15-13 on a
last-second pass play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Good Lord had to be looking out for Marshall that day, and
he still is now,'' Pruett said, thinking about Pennington's
game-winning pass against Western Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall television play-by-play announcer Keith Morehouse lost
his father in the crash. Gene Morehouse was the Herd's radio
announcer.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who haven't been through the crash don't understand why
it's such an emotional thing to see this team succeed,'' Morehouse
said. ``When my father was here, Marshall was so bad. This kind of
allows me to finish the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Pennington, born to Marshall alumni six years after the crash,
said, ``There's no doubt that this is a miracle.''

   NEWYEAR _ ATLANTA _ Rosalyn McCrary had a bad case of the
Millenium jitters. The banquet server at the Marriott Hotel at
Lenox was scheduled to work New Year's Eve but feared leaving her
young son at home alone. So she approached her boss about the
problem. That discussion set into motion a novel way to help
workesrs cope with being sepArated during the holiday. The hotel
management has set aside 50 rooms _ that go for mroe than $200 a
night _ for employees and their families. The hotel will pay the
costs of the room and food for the night. It's a small price to pay
for their peace of mind, said the hotel's GM. (Poole, Atlanta

   SHOPLIFTING _ It's a gangbuster holiday season for retailers,
but it's also one for shoplifters. The more shoppers in retail
stores, the greater the chance that the employees will be
distracted. Thieves are lifting everything from athletic shoes to
CD's, which rank among the nation's most stolen items, according to
a 1998-1999 study conducted by Loss Prevention Specialists, a
consulting group in Winter Park, Fla. (Degross, Atlanta

   JESUS-APPEARANCE _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Jesus Christ is
worshiped as the human incarnation of the son of God, and his
likeness has been reproduced for hundreds of years by thousands of
artists. But they've all been making it up. The Apostles were
assiduous in copying down Jesus' message, but no one bothered to
write about his appearance. We know some things he said, but not at
all how he sounded. And though Bible readers are given vague hints
about the visage of the Prince of Peace, even those are
contradictory. (Belkin, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   JESUS-CRUCIFY _ The spikes nailed through Jesus' wrists and
ankles did not kill him. The crown of thorns that cut into his brow
was little more than a nuisance, and the whipping he endured before
he was crucified was almost an act of mercy. (Belkin, Palm Beach
Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   JESUS-LIFE _ Jesus may have been the Prince of Peace, but if his
life was at all typical of his fellow Nazarenes in the first
century, he didn't live like royalty while he was growing up.
(Belkin, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   JESUS-MISTLETOE _ The mistletoe you're trying to get caught
under this Christmas season wasn't always the semi-parasitic plant

   PANAMA-CANAL _ PANAMA CITY _ After 85 years, the U.S. hands over
the Panama Canal at noon on Dec. 31 in a ceremony sure to kick up a
new round of debate among worried conservatives. Critics have never
been comfortable with the deal brokered 22 years ago by then-U.S.
President Jimmy Carter, fearing the Panamanians will overcharge
ships using the canal and possibly hamstring the U.S. military.
Lately, they've been outraged at a deal cut by the Panamanians to
let a Hong Kong company run the busy ports at either end of the
50-mile-long canal, saying the company is a front for the Chinese
military. Meanwhile Panamanians plan elaborate ceremonies for an
event they believe will showcase their emergence on the world stage
and symbolize their autonomy after decades of U.S. domination.

   CANAL-SECURITY _ PANAMA CITY, Panama _ A terrorist with a
suitcase full of explosives could probably shut down the Panama
Canal for years, American conservatives warn, crippling a vital
U.S. commercial and military link. How real is the threat, how
important is the canal to the U.S. and how vulnerable is the
waterway now that the U.S. military has closed its bases in Panama?
Critics also charge that a company with contracts to run ports at
both ends of the canal is a front for the Chinese military _
charges that Pentagon officials deny. We explore the issue with
comments from conservative activists and canal administrators.

   CANAL-WORKERS _ PANAMA CITY, Panama _ American school kids are
taught that the Panama Canal is one of America's proudest
achievements, an engineering marvel that ushered in the American
Century. But probably few people realize that it was the sweat,
muscle and blood of black Caribbean laborers that actually dug the
50-mile-long ditch. Of 5,000 workers who died during the American
effort, 4,500 were black West Indians, who endured segregated
living quarters, unequal pay scales and the terrible dangers of the
backbreaking job. We interview an 86-year-old black canal worker
whose father and grandfather labored on the project, telling the
story through his eyes. Will seek comments from other black
workers, as well. (MWilliams, Cox News Service). 20. WITH PHOTO

   CHRISTIANITY-WORLD _ The spread of Christianity transformed the
Western world. As the third millennium approaches, the movement is
far removed from what it was at its inception. Today, almost one
third of the world's population is Christian. For believers, Jesus
is the hinge of history. But even by secular standards, Jesus is
the dominant figure of Western culture. In this last installment of
a yearlong project, we explore the growth of Christianity around
the world, especially its impact in Asia and Africa and
re-emergence in Russia. (White, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) 50.

and some say collaborator, that has now emerged as a powerful
political and economic force in the new Russia. (Holmes, Cox News

   CHRISTIANITY-ASIA _ SEOUL, South Korea _ This region of the
world has been one of the more painful ones for Christians and
their beliefs. They face persecution everywhere. Vietnamese police
have raided a number of Christian gatherings across the country in
recent months, detaining and harassing scores of worshipers.
Vietnam's Christian population is unclear, although the country of
79 million has 8 million Catholics, the largest community in
Southeast Asia outside the Philippines. But in secular South Korea,
the number is growing and becoming one of the most active churches
in East Asia. (Kirk, Cox News Service) 40. MOVED TUESDAY.

   CHRISTIANITY-LATIN _ MEXICO CITY _ In this fervently Catholic
country, they build shrines by the thousands and crawl on their
knees to honor the Virgin Mary at her own special basilica. The
main purpose of the pope's trip to Mexico earlier this year _ his
fourth trip to this country _ was to address challenges to the
Catholic Church in the Americas, the most Catholic region in the
world. Mexico is considered a geographic powerhouse for the Vatican
because it is a bridge between South America and North America,
where the church is concerned about the spread of materialism and
secularism. And Mexico, whose Catholic population is second only to
Brazil in number, is home to the Basilica of the Virgin of
Guadalupe, the second-most visited Catholic sanctuary in the world
after St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. (Ferriss, Cox News Service).

continue to come. Mike Mozley, a missionary from Marietta, Ga.,

UNDATED: love these people.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When she started working with the homeless 13 years ago, mental
illness was not part of the equation. ``We used to laugh and say
you don't have to be mentally ill to get to the Night Shelter, you
end up that way once you get there,'' Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   That has changed. A national study on homelessness published
recently found that not only are the homeless deeply impoverished,
but 39 percent also have symptoms of mental illness, as Ruth
McClain does. Two-thirds are suffering from chronic or infectious
diseases, not including AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   That mirrors the situation here, said Guinn, who estimates tha
about 30 percent of the homeless population in Tarrant County is
mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   The new Safe Haven, Suggs said, ``will allow us to give them a
better place to stay than the shelter. It's designed to draw those
who we think can be treated and enticed into accepting treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the only thing to do is wait and hope.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   I wondered if Ruth would remember me when I visited her again
recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kinda do and I kinda don't,'' she says, then asks me to move
out of the sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   I move and try to jog her memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came by a few months ago with John Suggs from the
Presbyterian Night Shelter,'' I say. ``And Lettie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah. You're the reporter from the Star-Telegram.''
</P>
<P>
   I am surprised. ``Yes, how are you?''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth reaches over and shuts off Bennie Goodman playing on KLTY
radio. She spits on two fingers to tidy her hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked like a million dollars yesterday,'' she says, her
smile giving way to embarrassment. ``And you show up today?''
</P>
<P>
   This is on Tuesday, Dec. 6, and the weather has turned colder,
the temperature hovering close to 50 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The ``camp'' has changed from the time of our first visit in
September. A piece of plywood stands guard against the brisk winter
wind at one end and two pieces of dirty white and gray tarp pieced
together with safety pins provide a partial roof. Ruth sits where
she was the first time I saw her, on a dirty blue twin mattress
facing University Drive.
</P>
<P>
   Her clothes are layered to keep her warm, a striped
ramie-and-cotton sweater over a green T-shirt, and navy blue cotton
pants. A green sleeping bag is pulled around her shoulders. A
propane stove burns on the ground between her and the six cats.
</P>
<P>
   It is a gift from her younger sister, Bonnie, Ruth says.
``Patty,'' however, is scribbled on a store receipt she shows me
later. It is one of many such entries she has tucked into a thick
notebook describing the people who have visited her and the gifts
they bring.
</P>
<P>
   On one page, she has scribbled my name with the day and date of
our first visit: Tuesday, Sept. 28, 1999. There is a notation that
Suggs brought coffee and doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth's story hasn't changed much since then. She still insists
that God sent her here, that President Clinton is part of a
conspiracy to kill her, and that she has the power to fend off evil
by simply looking at a person and crossing her hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``They run, I'm so full of the anointing,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   I'm resigned to accepting Ruth as she is.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson, though, has since written me again. His words seem
more frantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lady is still living under the bridge,'' he writes.
``Pretty soon it will get very cold. What do you think will happen
to her then? I wonder what would happen to her if someone did force
her to leave? Would it really mess her up more than she already
is?''
</P>
<P>
   I don't have the answers. But I would like to believe that if I
were in Ruth's shoes, someone would try to help me and insist I go
to a better place. Even against my will.
</P>
<P>
   But Ruth insists she is fine. She isn't. Ruth McClain is the
shadow of another woman who I imagine is smart and funny and full
of life and love.
</P>
<P>
   When Top Cat paws at a withered sunflower on the ground, Ruth
scolds him, and I think that she loves flowers, cares about things
pretty. Watching her with her cat, I wonder if she has children, if
her sister Bonnie is real.
</P>
<P>
   ``An angel planted flowers just yesterday,'' she says. ``You
should've seen this place. I had it looking real nice.''
</P>
<P>
   When I say goodbye, she yells, ``Come back when I've got things
set up looking nice again.''
</P>
<P>
   I tell her I will, but I'm worried now, like Dickerson. There
are more cold fronts now; it's finally raining again. I wonder if
Ruth and her cats will survive.
</P>
<P>
   People say that this is the season for miracles. I hope there's
one left for Ruth.

SAVING RUTH MIGHT REQUIRE A HOLIDAY MIRACLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been nearly three months since John Suggs, executive
director of the Presbyterian Night Shelter, Lettie Zeweldemariam,
manager of the new Safe Haven, and I met Ruth McClain.
</P>
<P>
   The makeshift ``missionary camp'' tucked between two brick posts
under the Rosedale overpass in Fort Worth isn't the sort of place
anyone would want to visit, let alone live. The stench last summer
was almost unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the place McClain has called home for more than a
year. This place, on a small patch of ground between Rogers Road
and South University Drive, is where she says God told her to set
up camp, to build the World Global Mission Ministry for those who
are homeless like her. This is where she is safe from those who
want her dead, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to shut down the Union Gospel Mission and
Salvation Army, but now I'm just going to help them,'' she says.
``I'm waiting on the $200 million now.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, I returned to visit McClain, who was still waiting for
her millions. This time, afraid that her family of six cats might
die in the cold, she was expecting a Winnebago to be delivered as
well.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tony Guinn, director of specialized services for
Tarrant County Mental Health Mental Retardation, as many as 2,000
people in Tarrant County are like Ruth, homeless and suffering from
mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   And nothing can get them off the street and on medication except
gentle persuasion.
</P>
<P>
   I had passed Ruth's camp many times in the past year, en route
to my daughter's piano class or the shops in University Village.
Each time, I'd look to see if she was still there. I wondered how
she ended up in such a place. Because of my fears, I never stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in late September, I received an e-mail from Doug
Dickerson, a former member of the board at the Presbyterian Night
Shelter, telling me about ``a lady'' under the Rosedale Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a miracle she has not been killed or injured,''
Dickerson wrote. ``She is very neat and tidy, and apparently there
are a number of people bringing her food, water, ice, etc., but she
obviously needs help.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson said that the Presbyterian Night Shelter had tried to
intervene, but that she refused to accept help. He said he thought
a story about her might help.
</P>
<P>
   I soon learned, though, that unless Ruth proved to be a threat
to herself or someone else, she was simply exercising her right to
do as she pleased.
</P>
<P>
   The woman I met that day didn't seem capable of harm. I could
see that by the way she cared for her cats. She was a large woman
with a quick smile. She talked nonstop, moving in and out of
reality as quickly as she batted her eyelashes, thick with black
mascara. She talked about the mission God told her to build and the
``plot by the FBI and President Clinton'' to have her killed.
</P>
<P>
   We talked for the first time in September. Although the camp was
cluttered, everything was in its place. It was a perfect rectangle,
bordered by a twin-size mattress, bridge posts and plastic crates
that made a 4-foot wall facing University. Top Cat and the other
cats made their home in one crate on the ground. On top was a Bible
opened to the book of Exodus.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth said she was a computer operator at Texas Christian
University when the Lord called her to the street in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, she said, he has saved her from tuberculosis,
ovarian cancer and brain cancer and, at that very moment, was
healing her of breast cancer. She told me the freckles on her body
represent the anointing of the Holy Spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not nuts,'' Ruth said, laughing. ``I'm an apostle, and an
apostle is called to suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Since I first met Ruth, I've visited with Guinn at the county
mental health offices. I met Carol Sweeney, a board member at the
Presbyterian Night Shelter and a longtime advocate for the
homeless. I visited the shelter, where Sweeney introduced me to
some residents, told me their stories.
</P>
<P>
   The night before, a homeless woman had given birth on the
railroad tracks nearby. As Sweeney described a day in her life at
the shelter, I watched a woman they call Mama Sun.

 &HT;    BETHLEHEM MIXES CHRISTMAS SPIRIT AND POLITICAL ASPIRATIONS
 &HT;    EDS: Corrects grammar in 10th graf 
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHLEHEM _ Almost 2000 years later, people in the city where
Christ was born are hoping for a lot more than just a Merry
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Bethlehem is not a ``little town'' any more. It's a crowded
Palestinian city trying to rebuild after decades of neglect and
Israeli occupation. Christmas and the millennial year 2000 are
opportunities for Bethlehem to emerge anew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, one-third of the world is looking toward Bethlehem. The
burden is very heavy but we are prepared,'' Bethlehem Mayor Hanna
Nasser said recently. ``We know very well this is a religious
occasion, but we should never forget that it has more than one
dimension.''
</P>
<P>
   The other dimensions, he stressed, are ``political, tourism and
development.''
</P>
<P>
   This week around Manger Square, the plaza in front of the Church
of the Nativity, work was going full speed on all three fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Workers polished the tile road markers on Star Street, where new
stone walkways, sewage systems and electrical wiring are still
being completed between the crowded homes.
</P>
<P>
   Shopkeepers opened the doors on new stores along an area _ long
ignored by visitors _ remade into a ``Christmas Market.''
</P>
<P>
   And across the base of the large stage where choirs will sing on
Christmas Eve, Arabic letters make the political point: ``From
Bethlehem 2000 to the independence and building of the Palestinian
state, with its capital of holy Jerusalem and under the leadership
of President Yasser Arafat.''
</P>
<P>
   Raja Zacharia, 38, recently converted his grocery store to a
shop for the olive wood Christmas ornaments he makes. A Roman
Catholic, his father was killed by Israeli shelling in the 1967
Arab-Israeli war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need peace here in the land of peace,'' Zacharia said,
adding that he is skeptical that the city will ever find
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The city, just five miles south of Jerusalem, was under British
and then Jordanian control until Israel captured it in 1967. The
following years saw it beset by tens of thousands of Palestinian
refugees. Road work, sewers and water systems were overloaded.
</P>
<P>
   The town joined the rest of the West Bank during the Palestinian
Intifada uprising of the late 1980s, and was for years the scene of
stone throwing, rubber bullets and tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Israel transferred control of the city to the
Palestinian Authority, run by Arafat. Still bracketed by Israeli
roadblocks, Bethlehem is one of more than 100 sectors of the West
Bank that have been turned over. But, the Palestinians' dream _ of
their own state with a capital in Israeli-controlled Jerusalem _ is
still subject to the hard haggling of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Bethlehem has a population of about 50,000 and is the center of
a district with about 150,000. With the influx of mostly Muslim
refugees, the Christian majority in the city has fallen to a
30-percent minority. Many Christians say they feel pushed aside by
the Muslims when it comes to jobs and other levers of power. Neon
crosses atop some homes and businesses are seen by some as an
assertion of their faith.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser, however, the mayor appointed by Arafat, is a Christian
and Christianity is acknowledged as the city's claim to fame.
</P>
<P>
   Each Christmas eve is marked by a Manger Square block party,
culminating with the midnight mass in the church. This year more
than 60,000 are expected there and more than 900 journalists have
credentials to attend.
</P>
<P>
   With foreign donations of more than $86 million, overseen by the
Palestinian Authority agency called Bethlehem 2000, Manger Square
has been converted from a noisy bus parking lot to a tree-lined
piazza.
</P>
<P>
   A museum and cultural center was built in place of a former
British and Israeli prison on the square. A five-star
Inter-Continental Hotel is being built around a former sultan's
palace on the edge of downtown. It will overlook the block houses
and dirt streets of a refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   City officials hope to shave off a greater percentage of the
tourist money spent by pilgrims coming from Israel next door. Signs
in the Christmas market proclaim, ``Come do your Christmas shopping
in the real capital of Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, a Muslim, has been an enthusiastic booster of the year
2000 effort, in contrast to his subdued Israeli rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinians have put the Israelis in the shade,'' said
Israeli Rabbi David Rosen, Israel director of the Anti-Defamation
League. He faults Israelis for late millennium preparation and says
they might miss a chance to improve relations between Jews and
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   In Bethlehem, residents see it as an opportunity they cannot
afford to miss.
</P>
<P>
   If the year 2000 is a success, Mayor Nasser said, people around
the world will ``consider Bethlehem as a spiritual capital and not
think of Bethlehem only on the 24th and 25th days of December.''

 &HT;    Raise, anyone? Big ones may be scarce in 2000
 &HT;    By Maria Mallory
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you want a fat raise to bring in the new
millennium, you are going to work really hard to get it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a strong economy and tight labor market, consultants are
predicting raises will be moderate for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing around a 4 percent merit increase budget'' from
companies responding to the annual Hewitt Associates Salary
Increase Survey, says Jane Romweber, a principal in the Atlanta
office.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bullish economy continues without a clear sign of
slowing down, employers are worried that higher labor costs can
have a compounding effect. Employees have to overcome those fears
and make their pitch on a personal level, career consultants say.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start talking about raises, everyone gets nervous.
They envision a price spiral,'' says Marilyn Moats Kennedy,
managing partner at Career Strategies, a management consulting firm
in Wilmette, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is going to overpay for an employee. They're going to
pay just what they have to pay to get an employee to work for them
and not a penny more.''
</P>
<P>
   That means, projections or not, nothing is promised. ``The
(projections) are averages, theoretically,'' Romweber advises.
``Your better performers get more, and your worse performers get
less.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even the better performers might have to labor for a
much-deserved raise. ``If you think they're going to recognize you
and give you money just because you're there, get over yourself,''
warns Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   So, how can you be the one to get the big bucks?
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to show that you returned more value to (your)
company this year than last year,'' says Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Here's where the economy plays in your favor. With unemployment
levels at record lows and the supply of skilled workers extremely
tight, companies don't want good employees leaving in a market with
scarce replacements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employers want continuity, so they have every reason to be
reasonable,'' says Romweber.
</P>
<P>
   A company that systematically underpays workers won't be
competitive for long. As a result, ``They have every reason to pay
you because in this full-employment marketplace, everybody's a free
agent.''
</P>
<P>
   To get the raise you deserve, try the ``sandwich technique.''
That's when you ``sandwich'' the request for more cash between
compelling, preferably quantitative support for your case,
according to Emory W. Mulling, president and founder of The Mulling
Group, an Atlanta-based outplacement and executive coaching
consulting firm that teaches this negotiation technique to its
clients.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works:
</P>
<P>
   _ Note all your accomplishments from the past 12 months to
``cost-justify'' your worth to the company, Mulling says. ``Try to
quantify as much as you can. You increased sales by a certain
percentage, you lowered overhead by a certain percentage, or you
implemented a program or system that saved the company this much
money.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask for the raise, using your accomplishments as leverage.
``What you say is, `Since I saved the company X number of dollars,'
or `I added to productivity,' whatever you can quantify,'' says
Mulling. You can check with your industry association or a trade
group for salary ranges to see how you're faring compared with your
peers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Seal the raise request with additional details about what you
accomplished last year, as well as an indication of what you plan
to do in the coming year. ``You try to demonstrate your value to
the company for next year as well,'' says Mulling.
</P>
<P>
   What if they say no?
</P>
<P>
   ``You have three options: Do nothing and accept it. Go look for
another job and possibly leave. Or, go back at a later time and ask
for reconsideration,'' says Mulling.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you do, don't threaten to leave, warned Mulling.
</P>
<P>
   If you get the raise, you don't want to be on the
prove-you're-worth-it side of an ultimatum. ``Sometimes the
employer gives the raise, their expectations go way up and they
say, `OK, kid. We're watching. If you're worth that much money,
you'd better deliver,''' says Romweber.
</P>
<P>
   If you do eventually leave the company, you don't want threats
to come back to haunt you. ``If you burn your bridges before you
leave, you may not get positive references,'' Mulling adds.
</P>
<P>
   If you decide to stay, ``You need to learn to be happy,'' says
Mulling. ``Don't let a bad attitude destroy your reputation and all
the hard work you've done,'' the consultant adds.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, you may have to ask again to receive. ``A lot of
people, when we go into the next recession, will not have asked for
a raise,'' says Kennedy. ``Then, they will go through another long
period and not get a raise. They'll never get it. They think it's
too awful to even broach the subject.''
</P>
<P>
   If last year wasn't your best for work performance, don't fret.
It's not too early to start strategizing for your 2001 increase _
and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   The first step is to sit down with your boss and find out what
high performance looks like, says Romweber. Find out how you're
viewed currently compared to that standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be straightforward,'' she says. ``I'm trying to manage my
career. I'd like to establish what my potential is and what plans
you have for the future. What are your performance expectations
going out?''
</P>
<P>
   With that information in hand, you can begin to shoot for the
top-level performance and start working to bag that big raise for
next year.

`THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY': CARNAL, GLAMOROUS AND WORTH THE PRICE

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A flood of adjectives bursts onto the screen at the start of
Anthony Minghella's glittering new thriller, considering ways to
describe Tom Ripley before settling on ``talented'' as le mot
juste. This is only a minuscule show of ingenuity, but it's also a
promise that the film will keep. ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' offers
diabolically smart surprises wherever you care to look.
</P>
<P>
   Its opening credit sequence alone is a model of exquisitely
economical suggestion, showing how the loan of a jacket with a
Princeton insignia leads Tom from the life of a New York City men's
room attendant to a thrillingly new world of opportunity. In a rush
of gorgeous, agile exposition, Tom winds up in Europe, learning to
say ``This is my face'' in Italian as he trains his binoculars on
Dickie Greenleaf. Dickie is the spectacularly charismatic
dilettante whose life Tom will eventually steal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you, the Greenleaf name opens a lot of doors,''
remarks the chauffeur who drives Tom away from a bleak Manhattan
neighborhood and hands him his first-class ticket for an ocean
passage. In light of the mind games that the movie has in store,
both the remark and the carnal high-low contrast (meat hangs on
hooks near the limousine) are as splendidly barbed as they can be.
</P>
<P>
   As a playwright and television writer who came to filmmaking
with two comparatively modest, whimsical efforts (``Truly, Madly,
Deeply'' and `` Wonderful'') before the exponential leap of ``The
English Patient,'' Minghella now establishes that his Oscar-winning
triumph was no fluke. His hypnotic, sensually charged adaptation of
Patricia Highsmith's fascinatingly reptilian murder story has the
same kind of complex allure that made ``The English Patient'' so
mesmerizing.
</P>
<P>
   This is a more conventional opportunity, being essentially the
story of a homoerotic Faustian bargain played for keeps. But
Minghella, who wrote and directed ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' with
acute attention to every nuance, significantly broadens what Ms.
Highsmith had in mind. Adding a couple of important new characters
and bringing the secrets of Tom's sexual longings to the surface,
he risks losing the profound chill that made Ripley so disturbing
in the first place. The character is several shades less loathsome
and more conscience-stricken than he was to begin with, and his
homosexuality is more openly expressed. But as played by Matt Damon
with a fine, tricky mix of obsequiousness and ruthlessness, the
nicer new Ripley is in no danger of losing his sting.
</P>
<P>
   In a scenic, voluptuously beautiful film (kudos to the
cinematographer, John Seale) that has a traffic-stopping cast,
Minghella carefully plants the seeds of mayhem. When Tom is hired
by Dickie's father (James Rebhorn) to bring the ne'er-do-well
Greenleaf scion home from Italy, he contrives to bump into Dickie
on the beach and to echo Dickie's infatuation with American jazz.
The year is 1958, and it seems an impossibly glamorous time as
depicted among pampered American expatriates in some of Italy's
most breathtaking settings.
</P>
<P>
   Tom's tricks, from wearing an embarrassingly skimpy chartreuse
bathing suit to casually flashing some of Dickie's favorite record
albums, neatly accomplish their purpose. Soon he has made himself
Dickie's latest diversion, and managed this without even alienating
Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow), Dickie's girlfriend. Marge was a thick,
lumpen target for Tom's misogyny in Ms. Highsmith's version. Here,
though still hopelessly oblivious to sexual currents between the
men, she becomes a reminder that Ms. Paltrow makes as savvy a
character actress as she does a swanlike leading lady.
</P>
<P>
   A word about the film's Dickie Greenleaf: this is a star-making
role for the preternaturally talented English actor Jude Law.
Beyond being devastatingly good-looking, Law gives Dickie the
manic, teasing powers of manipulation that make him ardently
courted by every man or woman he knows. During the first half of
the film, Dickie is pure eros and adrenaline, a combination not
many actors could handle with this much aplomb.
</P>
<P>
   During one especially sharp-edged scene here, as the tensions
surrounding Dickie approach the unbearable, the handsome heir
indulges in what he dismissively calls ``Marge maintenance'' on his
sailboat. Leaving Tom and another rich crony, Freddie Miles (Philip
Seymour Hoffman, scene-stealingly wonderful here), to wait uneasily
during this sexual interlude, Dickie avidly plays off each
passenger on the boat against the others. Something has to give.
</P>
<P>
   When it does, in the deadly encounter that sends Tom Ripley into
his new life, the film changes greatly in tone. Once its touristy
idyll is over, ``The Mr. Talented Ripley'' becomes an elaborate
round of gamesmanship about Tom's sleight-of-hand and how it can be
sustained. The ruse, which Damon handles coyly and credibly, if not
with the nascent Norman Bates streak that the situation warrants,
is given an added complication by the presence of Meredith Logue.
Meredith is a needy post-debutante played irresistibly by Cate
Blanchett. Once Meredith latches onto Tom, who she thinks is
Dickie, whom she regards as a bored and wealthy kindred spirit, the
story has developed all the dizzying cross-currents it deserves.
</P>
<P>
   The last part of the film runs into problems. Eventually tangled
up, like Tom, in the particulars of a trail of crime, it tries to
use yet another of Tom's attractions (to another new character,
played by Peter Smith-Kingsley) to settle his fate. And despite the
occasional flash of Hitchcockian magic _ like a scene involving a
razor blade in the pocket of a white bathrobe _ there are late
scenes that flounder or lag.
</P>
<P>
   These concluding events are far less meaningful than the ones
that sent Tom on his odyssey of self-invention in the first place.
As with any great impostor, there's more to say about where he came
from than where he has to go.

 &HT;    A wacky `Quest' for intergalactic fun
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Galaxy Quest,'' opening Saturday, is a sci-fi spoof that looks
great on paper.
</P>
<P>
   It's got all the goods: a beloved old TV show as over the top as
``Star Trek.'' Geeky fans _ let's call them Questers _ who take the
show way too seriously. And wacky aliens from far, far away who
lure the has-been ``Quest'' actors into helping rescue their
galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   On the big screen, however, it clicks only some of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman head the small band
of ex-``Galaxy Quest'' actors whisked off into space by the alien
Thermians to help them save Klatu Nebula from a particularly
nasty-looking race of warrior bug-lizards led by the evil Sarris
(Robin Sachs). The Thermians have latched on to the Earthlings
because they've intercepted transmissions of the TV show and
treated them like the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Galaxy Quest'' takes eons to take off. The opening, set at a
fan convention for the TV show, is so stilted and off-pace that
you'll probably think you're in for a long night at the movies. But
with decent special effects, an absurd sense of humor and the
Thermians' truly bizarre speech pattern, some fun finally kicks in.
</P>
<P>
   As Jason Nesmith (the TV show's Commander Peter Quincy Taggart),
Allen is as straightforward and oddly likable as he was for years
on TV's ``Home Improvement.'' Weaver's one-note jokes consist of
toting around big breasts and repeating everything the spaceship's
computer says.
</P>
<P>
   But the performances really worth seeing here belong to Tony
Shalhoub, who does an inspired, deadpan routine that's the exact
opposite of ``Star Trek's'' hepped-up, brogue-enriched engineer
Scotty, and Enrico Colantoni (TV's ``Just Shoot Me''), who plays
Thermian leader Mathesar with inventive childlike wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Many children will enjoy ``Galaxy Quest.'' Trekkies might even
fall to their knees. Others may resist falling for the movie's
cornball charm.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing is certain. ``Galaxy Quest'' is a bona fide
antidote to holiday stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Galaxy Quest''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman. Rated PG
for mild violence and sensuality. 1 hour,
</P>
<P>
   42 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: It'll beam you way, way up.

 &HT;    Austen falls short in modern world
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In recent years, Jane Austen's work has accommodated everyone
from Ang Lee to Alicia Silverstone. But somehow, Austen and
Patricia Rozema, who gave us the winningly daffy ``I've Heard the
Mermaids Singing,'' don't hit it off so well.
</P>
<P>
   Rozema has ``modernized'' Austen's third novel, ``Mansfield
Park,'' which opens Saturday in metro Atlanta. She's given it a
dash of lesbianism, a pinch of feminism and a dollop of social
conscience (the slave trade figures as the tainted source of the
family's money). Further, she has extrapolated portions of Austen's
own journals into the scribblings of the heroine, who now wants to
be a writer (she has no such literary ambitions in the book).
</P>
<P>
   Thus, this ``Mansfield Park'' becomes a kind of romanticized
gloss _ an imaginative grad-student thesis that melds author and
character. It sounds intriguing enough on paper, but on screen, it
loses much of Austen's sparkle, wit and point. And hearing an
Austen heroine worry about slavery is a bit jarring _ like hearing
one of the Pokemon characters ruminate about the effect of the
atomic bomb on the emotional life of postwar Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The story, in many ways, sounds more like something out of
Dickens. Ten-year-old Fanny Price is lifted from appalling poverty
by fate and genes. She's sent to live with her wealthy relatives,
the Bertrams, at Mansfield Park. Her position is a little uncertain
_ not quite family, yet not quite a servant. But then, everything
at Mansfield Park is a little uncertain _ from the imperious
patriarch, Sir Thomas (playwright Harold Pinter), to his
laudanum-addicted wife (a very funny Lindsay Duncan, who also
doubles as Fanny's poor mother back in Portsmouth).
</P>
<P>
   Fanny grows up to be Frances O'Connor, a cute-as-a-button
paragon of smarts, integrity, writing skills, you name it. Her best
friend and soul mate is Edmond (Jonny Lee Miller), Sir Thomas'
second son (the first is mostly busy slaving in Antigua). Clearly,
they're made for each other, but then there'd be no plot. So onto
the scene burst the thoroughly modern Crawfords, Henry (Alessandro
Nivola) and Mary (Embeth Davidtz), a charmingly unscrupulous
brother-sister act, who manage to turn things topsy-turvy at staid
Mansfield Park.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, an Australian actress who is already attracting
comparisons to Nicole Kidman, seems gloriously happy as a paragon;
she suggests Julie Andrews in ``The Sound of Music,'' without the
songs or the kids to upstage her. Everyone in the movie keeps
telling her how terrific she is (usually addressing her by her full
name). Even Lady Bertram manages to stumble out of her happy haze
to declare, ``The next time the pug has a litter, you shall have a
puppy!''
</P>
<P>
   Rozema's at-arm's-length contemporary agenda may work as an
intellectual exercise, but it robs the movie of any sense of
anything being at stake. Or, for that matter, of who some of these
people are. A last-act reconciliation between Sir Bertram and his
eldest son would be touching, I guess, if the son hadn't spent most
of his time off screen in Antigua. It's as if Rozema, deep down,
didn't trust the material. Maybe ``The Bridget Jones Diaries'' is
more her style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mansfield Park''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring Frances O'Connor, Jonny Lee Miller and Harold Pinter.
Directed by Patricia Rozema. Rated PG-13 for brief violent images,
sexual content and drug use. At metro theaters. 1 hour,

<P>
   52 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A bit clueless.

 &HT;    Minghella's `Mr. Ripley' treads intriguing psychological
territory
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Why is it that when men play, they always play at killing each
other,'' sighs Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow), watching her boyfriend,
Dickie, wrestle with his new best pal, Tom.
</P>
<P>
   What looks like a game becomes something much deadlier in ``The
Talented Mr. Ripley,'' writer-director Anthony Minghella's handsome
follow-up to his Oscar-sweeping ``The English Patient.'' Patricia
Highsmith's novel of the same name was the first in a series of
books featuring Tom Ripley, a smart, charming, sexually ambiguous
con man determined to live the high life, even if he has to kill to
do it.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Ripley,'' Tom (Matt Damon) gets his chance when New York
tycoon Herbert Greenleaf (James Rebhorn) mistakes him for an old
Princeton classmate of his son Dickie (Jude Law) and sends him on a
paid trip to Italy to bring home the prodigal young man. Once
there, glimpsing young Dickie (and his fine clothes and his yacht),
it's obvious that neither man will be swapping la dolce vita for a
ticket back to the States. Instead, Tom insinuates himself into the
wine-buzzed, suntanned ease of Dickie and Marge's days, eager to
make their monied lifestyle _ and even Dickie's identity _ his own.
</P>
<P>
   The couple finds him amusing to have around, like an exotic pet.
Oozing his sense of entitlement, Dickie is the kind to exclaim in
disbelief, ``Tom can't ski! '' He's a reflexive snob, like everyone
else in his social stratum. That includes pal Freddie (Philip
Seymour Hoffman), who derides Tom's corduroy jacket, and the
lockjawed heiress, Meredith (Cate Blanchett), whom Tom meets en
route to Italy. ``I'm only comfortable around other people who have
it and despise it,'' she moans about money.
</P>
<P>
   When he's dealing with class tensions, Minghella's writing is
sharp and perceptive. But when he tries to explain Ripley's psyche,
he oversimplifies. You might not mind, if you've never seen the
elegantly sinister 1960 French film ``Purple Noon,'' a version of
the same book that suggested more by stating less. Minghella's film
is more faithful to the novel's plot, but not to its psychology. He
reveals Tom's determination to steal Dickie's sun-drenched
lifestyle too early in the movie, before the men have even met.
</P>
<P>
   While Highsmith's novel itched with an unspoken homoerotic
attraction between Ripley and Dickie, Minghella puts that front and
center, showing that Tom is as much after Dickie's body as his
identity. (Tom even tries to slip into the bathtub with his new
friend.) In the book, Ripley's unformed sexuality is something he
doesn't act on. Foremost, he's a sociopath who adapts himself to
those he's with, so long as it gets him what he wants. In his film,
Minghella suggests that Ripley acts partly out of repressed
longing; he becomes a gay killer. That might disturb anybody who
thinks that movies such as ``Basic Instinct'' and ``Cruising'' have
done enough damage in linking gay sexuality and homicidal
instincts.
</P>
<P>
   There's a bigger problem. Damon and Law should have swapped
roles. Law has a sexy, menacing energy that better suits Ripley's
charming amorality. Damon, trying to stretch his good-guy image,
doesn't generate the right amount of danger. When Dickie tells Tom,
``You're so white,'' he's talking about his pallor, but the words
could apply to Damon's performance: He lacks shading. Even when his
Ripley is threatening someone with a straight razor (cutting
himself in the process, like Glenn Close in ``Fatal Attraction''),
you can feel him working too hard to convince us.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Ripley'' is an elegant pageant peppered with sharp
performances. Law makes the strongest impression, followed by
Blanchett's amusing, world-weary turn as a deb who falls for
Tom-as-Dickie. Hoffman brings his reliable Ugly American energy to
his handful of scenes as a boorish pal. Paltrow is adequate, but
doesn't come up with any new tricks to make Marge distinct. She's
just The Girl.
</P>
<P>
   As in ``The English Patient,'' Minghella heightens his tale with
visual opulence (the movie was shot in Naples, Rome, Venice and
other Italian cities). He smartly uses the 1950s time frame as an
excuse to literally jazz up the soundtrack. In a way, his
attractive filmmaking is more seductive than the script's mind
games. The movie lets us take as much vicarious pleasure as Ripley
does in the Mediterranean sun and Venetian interiors. It's an
Italian feast, spiked with just enough arsenic to make the flavors
interesting and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Talented Mr. Ripley''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matt Damon, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow and Cate
Blanchett. Rated R for violence, language and brief nudity. 2
hours, 18 minutes. At metro theaters starting Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A handsome adaptation of a twisty thriller.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar prospects: Actor (Matt Damon), supporting actress (Cate
Blanchett), supporting actor (Jude Law), cinematography, costumes,
score and adapted script. It already has received five Golden Globe
nominations, including best drama and actor (Damon).

NEW INVESTOR HELPS OTTEN BUILD MOUNTAINS OF CONFIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for Lewiston and all needing.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As he was forming the American Skiing Company in recent years,
Les Otten, who holds a private pilot's license, saw the
organization grow so fast that he said he felt like he was trying
to land an F-15 on a carrier deck but suddenly realized he hadn't
learned to fly.
</P>
<P>
   But reports after last year's miserable ski season that Otten
had crashed and burned, are unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, while this season's lack of natural snow has prompted
ASC to cobble together an arcane ``guaranteed skiing'' deal to
visitors, Otten's empire has been given a major infusion of new
capital _ $150 million invested by the Texas-based firm of Oak Hill
Partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have stabilized our company,'' says Otten, who still works
out of an office at the base of Sunday River in Bethel, Maine.
``Oak Hill's cash was a pretty important investment. I feel very
secure in the company's position and our ability to perform in the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many new companies, ASC has yet to turn a profit, and since
going public two years ago, the company's stock has taken a
beating. Last year's snowless winter resulted in a $32.3 million
loss and employee layoffs across the resort holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Otten pressed on, developing ever more slopeside real
estate, acquiring new holdings and upgrading almost all the
properties. ASC owns Sunday River and Sugarloaf in Maine;
Killington/Pico, Sugarbush, and Snow/Haystack in Vermont;
Attitash/Bear Peak in New Hampshire; Heavenly in California,
Steamboat in Colorado, and The Canyons in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Having grown so large so fast, then suffering the worst ski
seasons in a generation in the East _ and no great shakes in the
Rockies _ Otten's could be forgiven a case of the nerves about now.
But, he says, ``This time of year, the pressures are all positive.
We're getting psyched for a new season, the adrenline's flowing. If
I had that faint a heart, I shouldn't have gotten into the ski
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ever since his college days in New Jersey more than 30
years ago when he tried to buy a small ski area near home, Otten
has worked fulltime on buying and developing ski areas. And ski
seasons, he has come to know, tend to average out. Financial
analysts have assessed ASC's situation as stable enough to survive,
even through subpar winters. Still, says Otten, ASC needs a decent
winter to resume working toward its longer-range goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is we're entering this year so much stronger
financially,'' says Otten.
</P>
<P>
   But surviving a season or two is far from what Otten _ or his
investors _ had in mind. Known for over 25 years as one of the best
snowmakers in the industry, ASC is staying technologically current
in snowmaking at all areas, according to Otten, and the company is
moving ahead with several projects, some of which were shelved last
season.
</P>
<P>
   The largest single challenge has been the development of The
Canyons in time for the 2002 Winter Olympics. With 3,300 skiable
acres and a vertical rise of 3,200 feet, The Canyons is currently
the seventh largest ski area in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The area currently has the approvals to become the largest ski
in the United States,'' says Otten. ``We're just putting the
finishing touches on about 1,500 new beds that will all be
available by the first of February.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a remarkable opportunity to get it. If you could have
been at Aspen in the 1950s or Vail in the 1960s or Beaver Creek in
the 1980s, that's kind of the opportunity that The Canyons is
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of skiers seem to agree. Early in the New Year a 350-room
Grand Summit _ largest and fanciest of the ASC slopeside hotels _
will be pened. It already is 60 percent sold out. The familiar
quarter share (giving owners one-fourth of the time in a season,
with option trades around the resort world) sells for $115,000 for
a two-bedroom. Total net is $460,000. Another lodge, the Sundial,
opened with an offering of two-bedroom condos at $400,000 each and
sold out in 10 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very happy and optimistic about the fact that young
families are making investments in ski areas at a record pace,''
says Otten, whose new Jordan Grand Hotel at Sunday River is 70
percent sold.
</P>
<P>
   Otten's story is as well known and oft-told as any folk tale in
ski literature _ how a young cast-off executive from the Killington
Ski Company inside of two decades owned that area and eight others,
making him the largest single entrepeneur in skiing.
</P>
<P>
   So meteoric was his rise that as big as the company grew, so did
his status as a target. ``Sure I was up there for people to take
shots at,'' says Otten, who is quick to add that ASC is ``now in a
position to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Longer-term questions, such as the flat number of skier visits
for several years and the aging of the boomer generation do not
worry him. ``Luckily,'' he says, ``Jake Burton invented snowboards.
I'm optimistic. Taking a longer view, we have a record number of
young people entering the sport. We have a record number of people
buying real estate in our company, and the pace they're buying is a
record. It far exceeds anything we saw in the '70s and '80s.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his favorite getaways is still to take off for five-plus
days with family and friends to ski areas outside ASC property
(``Every day skiing at your own area is a work day,'' he says). He
skis all over the world, and even has a snowboard in his office
that he uses ``maybe 10 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still enjoy skiing,'' says Otten, whose wife, Chris, has
been in the retail skiwear business at Sunday River and other Otten
holdings. ``I started with those feelings for the sport, and I
still have a passion for it.''

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Africa's Elephant Kingdom'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary
</P>
<P>
   It has some eye-poppingly large pachyderms, but it isn't as
visually astounding as ``Everest.'' Still, this Imax film has its
share of lovely images, including time-lapse shots of the sun
setting on the dusty horizon and a massive storm whirling across
the plain. (SM) 40 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Alaska: Spirit of the Wild'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Narrated by Charlton Heston.
</P>
<P>
   It's big, it's bold, it's big ... The sheer size of the latest
Imax offering sometimes makes it an eye-opening experience.
Otherwise, this visit to the far, brrr-cold reaches of our biggest
state is just another Discovery Channel-style nature flick. The
film spans millenniums _ and throws in bits and pieces about the
ice age, the Klondike Gold Rush, caribou hunting and bears. (Bob
Longino) 40 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``All About My Mother'' R (profanity, sexuality, drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Cecilia Roth, Marisa Paredes, Penelope Cruz and Antonia
San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   Spain's bad-boy filmmaker Pedro Almodovar grows up with this
humane celebration of nurturing women. ``All About My Mother'' is a
virtually male-free fable with a title inspired by that backstage
classic, ``All About Eve.'' It's a movie that can wink at its own
campy sensibility while still grabbing you by the gut. Dark and
tender, the movie beautifully balances humor and heartache. In
Spanish with subtitles. (SM) 1 hour, 41 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' R (strong sexuality, nudity, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   violence and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Spacey
</P>
<P>
   and Annette Bening.
</P>
<P>
   A beaut. The ever-more-remarkable Kevin Spacey leads a stellar
ensemble cast (Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Chris Cooper) in this
scarily disturbing, daringly hilarious comedy-drama in this fin de
siecle tragifarce centering on Spacey as a man caught in a midlife
limbo. The movie is a hauntingly optimistic elegy for America the
Beautifully Screwed Up. (ERG) 1 hour, 58 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Anna and the King'' PG-13 (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jodie Foster
</P>
<P>
   and Chow Yun-Fat.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we didn't need another version, but this one is handsome
and engaging. Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat star in this lavish,
songless costume drama that holds its own against the beloved 1956
musical ``The King and I.'' A mix of old-fashioned moviemaking
doused with contemporary political correctness, it arrives at
exactly the right time of year. (SM) 2 hours, 20 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Given Sunday'' R (profanity, sexuality and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Al Pacino, Jamie Foxx
</P>
<P>
   and Cameron Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Stone takes on pro football's dark side _ pills, booze,
prostitutes, shady back-office deals _ and almost fumbles. The
jarring game visuals come at you nonstop. Al Pacino plays the coach
of the fictional Miami Sharks and argues constantly with young team
co-owner Cameron Diaz. Jamie Foxx plays a rising quarterback and
emerges the best actor in the large cast. (Bob Longino) 2 hours, 50
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere but Here'' PG-13 (sex-related material)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Susan Sarandon
</P>
<P>
   and Natalie Portman.
</P>
<P>
   A monster of an Oscar-nomination machine. Both Susan Sarandon
and Natalie Portman deserve to be on the short list come Academy
Awards time for breathing fresh air into an all-too-familiar
mother/daughter act. Sarandon, the brassy, indomitable mom, brings
her teenage daughter (Portman) to Hollywood to become a star. The
plot is negligible, but the performances are the point. (ERG) 1
hour, 40 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Being John Malkovich'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Cusack, Cameron Diaz,
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Keener and John Malkovich.
</P>
<P>
   It's a loopy original. John Cusack plays a quirky file clerk who
discovers a door that leads into the noggin of actor John
Malkovich. The movie toys with big concepts _ the nature of
identity, the lust for celebrity, sexual desire that blurs gender
lines, the illusion of free will _ without ever stopping long
enough to state a thesis. It's playfully profound one moment, gonzo
the next. And it's often hysterically funny. (SM) 1 hour, 52
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Bicentennial Man'' PG (profanity and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robin Williams,
</P>
<P>
   Embeth Davidtz and Sam Neill.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Williams plays the android Andrews, a metallic butler who
slowly develops human traits (creativity, curiosity and a hint of
emotion). But the people around him age, wither, die. Overlong,
like most flicks this time of year, ``Man'' moves swiftly for its
first 90 minutes, but it slows down to become a disappointingly
conventional love story that isn't really persuasive. The movie has
a heart, but a flagging pulse. (SM) 2 hours, 12 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bone Collector'' R (profanity, violence and grisly images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Denzel Washington
</P>
<P>
   and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Double Jeopardy,'' this crime drama is, at its core, pure
pulp filmmaking. It delivers plenty of sucker punches. But thanks
to the film's two talented stars _ Denzel Washington as a brainy
quadriplegic detective and Angelina Jolie as his equally brainy
forensics cop _ this thriller's got enough electricity to make it
watchable. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 58 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cider House Rules'' PG-13 (sexuality, nudity,
</P>
<P>
   substance abuse, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michael Caine
</P>
<P>
   and Tobey Maguire.
</P>
<P>
   John Irving has adapted his own novel. In the first half, Dr.
Larch (Michael Caine) delivers babies and performs illegal
abortions in his remote Maine orphanage. In the second,
less-engaging half, Larch's protege, parentless Homer Wells (Tobey
Maguire), runs off with a World War II pilot and his girlfriend to
learn about the world. Excellent performances by Caine and by
Delroy Lindo as an apple picker. (ERG) 2 hours, 5 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Dogma'' R (profanity, sex-related dialogue,
</P>
<P>
   violence, drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ben Affleck,
</P>
<P>
   Matt Damon and Linda Fiorentino.
</P>
<P>
   As if God can't take a joke, ``Dogma'' has already been
lambasted by a Catholic anti-defamation group and dumped by its
original studio Miramax (the indie Lions Gate picked it up). While
the film pulls no punches in roasting organized religion, it does
so with such minimal spunk and spare inventiveness you have to
wonder what all the fuss is about. (Bob Longino) 2 hours, 5
minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``End of Days'' R (violence and gore, a strong sex scene,
</P>
<P>
   profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger
</P>
<P>
   and Gabriel Byrne. Bigger than ever, the movies' biggest he-man
Arnold Schwarzenegger leaps into action, going mano a mano with a
beady-eyed Gabriel Byrne as the devil in this explosion-happy
thriller. Awash in often too-dark cinematography and bloated with
bombs, gore and gross-outs, ``Days'' is a movie full of punches but
no spark. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 58 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story Imax
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' (SM) 44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Galaxy Quest'' PG (mild violence and sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tim Allen,
</P>
<P>
   Sigourney Weaver
</P>
<P>
   and Alan Rickman.
</P>
<P>
   It'll beam you up, up and away. Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver and
Alan Rickman lead a small band of has-been sci-fi TV show actors
lured by misguided aliens into helping them save their far, far
away galaxy from an invasion of evil bug-lizards. Though it starts
slowly, ``Quest's'' completely cornball humor sometimes scores
direct hits. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 42 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Green Mile'' R (profanity, violence,
</P>
<P>
   sex-related material)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Hanks
</P>
<P>
   and Michael Clarke Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   A manipulative but meticulously crafted, absorbing, beautifully
acted and deeply satisfying adaptation of Stephen King's prison
novel. Tom Hanks plays a 1930s death row guard whose latest
prisoner, a mysterious hulk played by Michael Clarke Duncan, has
mystical powers of healing. ``Mile'' is exactly the sort of package
Oscar voters love. (SM) 3 hours, 2 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Last Night'' R (sexuality, profanity and brief violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sandra Oh, Don McKellar
</P>
<P>
   and Callum Keith Rennie.
</P>
<P>
   A lovely, offbeat look at the end of the world. Unlike
Hollywood's special-effects behemoths, Canadian
writer-director-actor Don McKellar treats the final apocalypse with
a dry wit and a sense of decorum that consciously tweaks that
nation's reputation for civility. A strong ensemble cast
(especially Sandra Oh) relate a variety of tales that are simple on
the surface, but cut deep. (SM) 1 hour, 33 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Liberty Heights'' R (profanity and sex-related material)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joe Mantegna,
</P>
<P>
   Adrien Brody and Ben Foster.
</P>
<P>
   Warmed-over chicken soup. Barry Levinson's movie about coming of
age in a Jewish neighborhood in 1950s Baltimore is generally
well-acted and sometimes evocative. His anecdotal reminiscences
concerning the Kurtzman brothers (Adrien Brody and Ben Foster)
don't convey much that's fresh or surprising. But Joe Mantegna
delivers an unexpected dignity and a nuanced self-knowledge as the
boys' numbers-running father. (ERG) 2 hours. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Man on the Moon'' R (profanity, sexuality and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jim Carrey,
</P>
<P>
   Danny DeVito and Paul Giamatti.
</P>
<P>
   A dizzying look at the mind of comic genius Andy Kaufman, capped
by Jim Carrey's spectacular performance. Carrey's impersonation of
the late, prankish Kaufman, a performer as interested in making
people squirm as making them laugh, is often so pitch-perfect, it's
more like channeling than acting. The movie's title comes from an
R.E.M. song about the comic, and the Athens band wrote the movie's
score. (SM) 1 hour, 58 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Mansfield Park'' PG-13 (brief violent images,
</P>
<P>
   sexual content, drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Frances O'Connor,
</P>
<P>
   Jonny Lee Miller and Harold Pinter.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Rozema's take on Jane Austen's third novel adds dollops
of lesbianism, feminism and social consciousness to Austen's
19th-century tale of Fanny Price (Frances O'Connor), a poor girl
shipped off to live with her wealthy relatives at Mansfield Park.
Rozema extrapolates bits of Austen's journals into Fanny's own
writing, melding character and author. It seems that Rozema didn't
trust her material. (ERG) 1 hour, 52 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Messenger:
</P>
<P>
   The Story of Joan of Arc'' R (graphic battles, a rape,
profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Milla Jovovich
</P>
<P>
   When Joan (Milla Jovovich) rallies her troops to victory against
the British, the film has considerable visual oomph. But when the
swordplay slows and the characters talk, you realize the film
doesn't know what to make of its heroine. It hedges its bets,
presenting her as equal parts saint and teenage fanatic. The result
is, pardon the term, half-baked. (SM) 2 hours, 21 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Mysteries of Egypt'' Unrated.
</P>
<P>
   Featuring Omar Sharif
</P>
<P>
   and Kate Maberly.
</P>
<P>
   National Geographic's bigger-than-life Imax film offers many
breathtaking views of Egypt's natural and man-made wonders. There
is ample footage of giant pyramids, huge statues and redwood-tall
columns, all frequently displayed from ground view with a seemingly
you-are-there feel. Warning: Some of the narration is pure hokum.
(Bob Longino) 40 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Pokemon: The First Movie'' G
</P>
<P>
   Animated feature
</P>
<P>
   directed by Kunihiko Yuyama.
</P>
<P>
   Hokey Poke. Based on the infinitely popular Japanese toy phenom,
the animated movie features Mewtwo, a Pokemon clone with psychic
powers who kapows his creators and starts cloning other Pokemons
into his personal arsenal for a world takeover. The movie has
intentionally stilted animation, uninspired music and lame jokes.
Includes the short cartoon ``Pikachu's Vacation.'' (Bob Longino) At
metro theaters. 1 hour, 29 minutes. F
</P>
<P>
   ``Princess Mononoke'' PG-13 (violence and gore)
</P>
<P>
   Featuring the voices
</P>
<P>
   of Billy Crudup, Billy Bob Thornton,
</P>
<P>
   Claire Danes and Minnie Driver.
</P>
<P>
   This is not Disney kid stuff. There's so much going on in this
astonishing, mystically complex animated epic from Japan that it
makes Wagner's Ring Cycle look like the Teletubbies. It's a ``once
upon a time'' tale about the battle between nature and
civilization. Boldly innovative yet eerily innocent, it's the sort
of thing you simply have to see for yourself. (ERG) 2 hours, 15
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Ride With the Devil'' R (graphic war violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tobey Maguire,
</P>
<P>
   Skeet Ulrich and Jewel.
</P>
<P>
   Worth the ride. Ang Lee's fervent, oddly gallant film about the
fringes of the Civil War. The movie is random, sprawling and
piecemeal, but it can be seen as a contemplation on the warring
factions of the American nature _ settling scores vs. settling
down. The film mostly takes place in Missouri and Kansas with
Quantrill's Raid on Lawrence, Kan., providing the blood-soaked
centerpiece and moral fulcrum. (ERG) 2 hours, 14 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Siegfried &AMP; Roy:
</P>
<P>
   The Magic Box'' Not rated.
</P>
<P>
   Featuring Siegfried Fischbacher
</P>
<P>
   and Roy Uwe Ludwig Horn.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Cirque du Surreal. Siegfried and Roy _ those
hocus-pocus, Las Vegas glam guys _ star in this dumbfoundingly
watchable 3-D Imax that's girded like some weird Wagnerian opera.
Elephants disappear. Furry white tigers leap over your head. Giant
metal dragons spew fire. Obviously, the concept of garish didn't
die with Liberace. (Bob Longino) 51 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' PG-13 (intense thematic material
</P>
<P>
   and violent images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette.
</P>
<P>
   A surprising, spine-tingling gem. Eight-year-old Cole (Haley
Joel Osment) can see ghosts, not the Casper variety but restless
phantoms with their skulls blown open. It's a fascinating, odd film
that speculates on what the relationship between the restless dead
and a liaison to the living world might be. Plus, this film has the
best, and loveliest, last-act twist of the year. (SM) 1 hour, 47
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleepy Hollow'' R (violence and gore,
</P>
<P>
   a scene of sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci
</P>
<P>
   and Miranda Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Heads up: Tim Burton is back. His latest is a blend of scary
swordplay, witchcraft and self-spoofing humor served with tongue
planted firmly in cheek. Johnny Depp is effective as Ichabod Crane,
who's sent to investigate a series of beheadings in 1799 Sleepy
Hollow. The movie's comic relief balances the Headless Horseman's
single-minded attacks, which spare neither men, women nor children.
(SM) At metro theaters. 1 hour, 45 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Straight Story'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Richard Farnsworth
</P>
<P>
   and Sissy Spacek.
</P>
<P>
   David Lynch shifts gears in this lyrically simple little film
based on the true story of 70-plus Alvin Straight (Richard
Farnsworth), who drove his John Deere riding mower more than 300
miles to reconcile with his brother (Harry Dean Stanton). It's a
sublime celebration of America at its most beautiful: kind,
welcoming, gloriously eccentric. (ERG) 1 hour, 41 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Stuart Little'' PG (brief profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Geena Davis,
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Lipnicki
</P>
<P>
   and the voice of Michael J. Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Based very loosely on E.B. White's 1945 children's book, Stuart
is a 3-inch-tall computer-animated wonder voiced by Michael J. Fox.
He brushes his teeth, gargles and aw-shucks smiles with such
convincing visuals you'll swear he's the next best critter since
``Babe.'' But his movie, at first charming and angelic, turns into
run-of-the-mill slapstick. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 33 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' R (violence, profanity, brief
nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matt Damon, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow and Cate
Blanchett.
</P>
<P>
   A handsome adaptation of novelist Patricia Highsmith's twisty
thriller. Matt Damon plays the title character, who travels to
Italy to bring back a rich man's son but ends up adopting his
lifestyle and committing murder. Fans of the earlier, superior
adaptation ``Purple Noon'' will likely find this lovely-to-look-at,
but psychologically flawed, version disappointing. (SM) 2 hours, 18
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Toy Story 2'' G
</P>
<P>
   Computer animation
</P>
<P>
   featuring the voices of
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hanks, Tim Allen and Joan Cusack.
</P>
<P>
   More rock 'em, sock 'em fun than families have seen in years.
Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and old and new
characters are locked in a delightful story of toy rustling and
what it means to love a child. With its inspired, hilarious script,
a heartfelt new song (``When She Loved Me'') and downright stunning
visuals, ``Toy Story 2'' isn't just better than ``Cats,'' it's
better than ``Toy Story.'' (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 25 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Tumbleweeds'' PG-13 (profanity, sensuality
</P>
<P>
   and a scene of domestic discord)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Janet McTeer
</P>
<P>
   and Kimberly J. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Definitely give this one a tumble. Janet McTeer and Kimberly J.
Brown are already generating Oscar buzz for their sensational
performances in this funny, heartfelt film. McTeer is a sassy
Southerner with a talent for finding the wrong men. Brown is her
savvy adolescent daughter who knows her mom's hit-and-run tactics
all too well. It sounds like ``Anywhere But Here,'' but it's a far
more real, more affecting work. (ERG) 1 hour, 40 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Is Not Enough'' PG-13 (violence, sexuality and
innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Pierce Brosnan,
</P>
<P>
   Sophie Marceau and Robert Carlyle.
</P>
<P>
   This 19th James Bond movie is more of the same old same old.
Bond is assigned by M (Judi Dench) to protect an heiress (Sophie
Marceau) and her oil pipeline from a nut-case terrorist (Robert
Carlyle). There's the usual eye-popping opening stunt sequence.
It's as if everyone involved knew how to make a Bond movie, but
they were thinking about something else at the time. (ERG) 2 hours,
8 minutes. C-

 &HT;    The straight story? A year filled with good pictures
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Dec. 26.
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's pleasantly difficult to winnow down the best titles in a
year that was unexpectedly bursting with good to great movies. Many
of them were made by young directors, including Paul Thomas
Anderson (``Magnolia'') and first-time feature directors Spike
Jonze (``Being John Malkovich'') and Kimberly Peirce (``Boys Don't
Cry''). Meanwhile, the older masters turned in work that was
disappointingly familiar (Martin Scorsese's ``Bringing Out the
Dead''), borderline bad (Stanley Kubrick's ``Eyes Wide Shut'') or
just peculiarly out-of-character (David Lynch's ``The Straight
Story,'' which many critics loved but for me was a condescending
bore).
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best of the year's movies shared themes, though they
explored them in very different ways. The focus was often on people
coming to a crisis point, causing them to change or rebuild their
lives (``All About My Mother,'' ``American Beauty''). Other movies
tweaked the notion of personal identity (``Boys Don't Cry,''
``Being John Malkovich,'' ``Fight Club,'' ``Man on the Moon'').
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the occasional popcorn-ready crowd-pleasers that
reveled in the thrill of telling a good story, whether made with a
huge budget (``The Matrix'') or almost none (``The Blair Witch
Project'').
</P>
<P>
   Here, in alphabetical order, is a very subjective list of my
faves of 1999:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``All About My Mother.'' Spanish filmmaker Pedro Almodovar's
hymn to strong women is his most mature movie, even while retaining
his usual gallery of drag queens, junkies and other outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``American Beauty.'' One moment a suburban black comedy, the
next a transcendent glimpse of the eternal, this out-of-nowhere
original from screenwriter Alan Ball is a breathtaking look at the
miraculous aspects of the everyday.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Being John Malkovich.'' So maybe you'd rather spend 15
minutes in the mind of Brad Pitt, but writer Charlie Kaufman and
director Spike Jonze created one of the wittiest, weirdest
explorations of identity of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Blair Witch Project.'' Yes, it was overhyped. But this
no-budget horror movie brilliantly reinvented campfire ghost
stories for the camcorder age and reminded Hollywood filmmakers
that a good yarn is more important than special effects.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Boys Don't Cry.'' Hilary Swank amazes as a woman
masquerading as a man; a thrilling debut from writer-director
Kimberly Peirce, who locates a tragic lyricism in the quick-mart
wastelands of Middle America.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Election.'' Alexander Payne's wicked comedy about the battle
of wills between a perky student and an ethics teacher is a
terrific indictment of the ways we all rationalize our bad
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Fight Club.'' Though it plots itself into a corner, David
Fincher's hyperkinetic flick delivers bracing social satire about
the loss of masculinity in the age of IKEA.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Magnolia.'' A kaleidoscopic meditation on love, estranged
parents and children, and the need for forgiveness; a huge leap
forward from ``Boogie Nights'' writer-director Paul Thomas
Anderson. (Opens Jan. 7 in metro Atlanta.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Man on the Moon.'' Jim Carrey gives the performance of his
life as comic Andy Kaufman in a movie that makes explicit the
latent hostility between a performer and his audience.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Matrix.'' Finally, a sci-fi adventure with a plot as
accomplished and witty as its special effects; a visual triumph
headlined by Keanu Reeves in a comeback no one could have
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the other best movies of 1999: ``The End of the Affair''
(opening Jan. 7 in metro Atlanta), ``The Insider,'' ``The Iron
Giant,'' ``Cookie's Fortune,'' ``The Limey,'' ``October Sky,''
``Ride With the Devil,'' ``The Sixth Sense,'' ``South Park: Bigger,
Longer &AMP; Uncut,'' ``The Winslow Boy,'' ``American Movie'' and
``Topsy-Turvy'' (the last two open here Jan. 21).

 &HT;    We laughed, cried, dreamed of big bucks
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Dec. 26.
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer and Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   So many shows, so little to watch. So ran the 1999 viewer
lament, the same as in years past. But even as ratings fell for the
big networks, there were some bright spots to be found as we
clicked around. Here are 10 of the most intriguing shows of the
year:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Sopranos'' (HBO) _ It sang, and will again. Returning in
January, the exquisitely layered mob-family drama made rival TV
executives drool with envy, made a sex symbol (sort of) of a fat,
midlife-muddled New Jersey gangster and made every other treatment
of organized crime on TV and most movies seem like concrete shoes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The West Wing'' (NBC) and ``Sports Night'' (ABC) _ Call it
``Sorkin TV'': Creator Aaron Sorkin provided the networks with a
comic drama and dramatic comedy.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``ER'' (NBC) _ Still the top doc after some past wobbling.
Crash-cart editing, guest star Alan Alda and millions of viewers
wishing someone would take a proctoscope to that nasty Dr. Romano.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Once and Again'' (ABC) _ Who said TV's just for kids? This
smart, sexy prime-time soap for baby boomers stars Sela Ward and
Billy Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Now and Again'' (CBS) _ Wacky idea _ a middle-aged man's
brain is transplanted into a young superman's body _ but it turned
out to be an utterly beguiling and unpredictable romance. With Eric
Close and Dennis Haysbert.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Daily Show'' (Comedy Central) _ Host Jon Stewart has
made this nightly news spoof late night's only appointment TV.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' (CBS) _ The family-based
anti-``Friends'': A ``Honeymooners'' for the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Iron Chef'' (The Food Channel) _ A Japanese cooking
competition, dubbed and subtitled, in which kitchen warriors made
weird dishes of octopus and yogurt while the announcer made it
sound like professional wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Simpsons'' (Fox) _ Just say D'oh! Homer and Co.
celebrate 10 years of nuclear family meltdown in January, and
they're sharper than ever.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Who Wants to Be
</P>
<P>
   a Millionaire'' (ABC) _ The season's guiltiest pleasure. And
that's our final assessment.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    The reason for the season stays the same, times reshape
celebration for everybody
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Saturday, Dec. 25.
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Christmas is changing. Just ask Santa.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Lee has played the role for six years at a metro Atlanta
mall, and has grown accustomed to kids asking for the same gifts _
Barbie dolls, toy soldiers, bikes and video games.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, he says, kids have been coming to Santa with some
strange requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``One little girl came up last year and said, `I want to live
with my man,''' Lee said. ``I told her, `Your daddy is your man. At
your age, that's the only man in your life.'''
</P>
<P>
   The kids' wish lists don't stop there. Some ask Santa's help in
reuniting divorced parents or springing a relative from jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had some teenagers come up to me and say, `Santa, I'm
having trouble at home and I need someone to talk to,''' said Lee,
51, who has spent the past month in a candy-cane red uniform at
South DeKalb Mall in Decatur, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   When Santa starts giving therapy instead of toys, something is
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Americans will greet a Rockwellian scene this
morning _ a warm, comfortable room filled with glittering
decoration and presents offered by loving family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   But this picture has become blurred, a victim of the frenzied
nature of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Critics lament the growing commercialization of the season, but
people like Lee notice more subtle changes. Traditions of
Christmases past _ homemade gifts, singing Christmas carols under
street lamplights and lavish home decorations _ are being squeezed
out by the pressures of modern life.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Gerald Durley, pastor of Providence Missionary Baptist
Church in Atlanta, says the Christmas season, like the pace of life
in general, has become more frenzied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find a certain tension in the worship service, with people
shopping around at the last minute and then flopping into church,''
says Durley, 57. ``It's become a part of the daily grind rather
than a time to reflect on the birth of Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   Durley says he's noticed a decline in many familiar Christmas
touches. Even traditional songs have changed, he says, forcing him
to call a local disc jockey, Frank Ski, to complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `Frank, I gotta turn your show off because I've
never heard anyone rap `O Silent Night,''' Durley recalls.
</P>
<P>
   He was particularly dismayed by a new rap version of ``Jingle
Bells'' that goes: ``Jingle bells, your dad's in jail, pay his bail
and get out all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big difference between that and `dashing through the
snow,''' Durley said.
</P>
<P>
   But Stephen Rasor suggests that all was not wonderful in
Christmases past.
</P>
<P>
   People tend to romanticize those years, says Rasor, a professor
of sociology at Atlanta's Interdenominational Theological Center, a
consortium of six seminaries near downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``As life becomes more complex and more hurried, we probably
exaggerate what may have been in the past,'' Rasor says. But he
doesn't argue that earlier generations had some advantages for
celebrating the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   In the earlier part of the century, families lived closer
together and were able to spend more time with one another, Rasor
says. That's no longer the case.
</P>
<P>
   Generosity also required more imagination. Homemade cards and
handcrafted items, which often took painstaking work, were more
common.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gift-giving was more personal and meaningful. People were
forced to make things. They could not get on the Internet and order
something or go to the mall,'' Rasor says.
</P>
<P>
   People had less money but they had more compassion for needy
strangers who approached them during the holiday, said Joe Burton,
who was born in Atlanta shortly before the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seemed to be more generous in the old days,'' said
Burton, 76, a state senator from Atlanta. ``If you were hungry,
people would share what they had. Nowadays, if a stranger knocked
on your door, if you're smart, you wouldn't open the door.''
</P>
<P>
   There is some good news, however. Not all recent holiday changes
have been bad.
</P>
<P>
   Burton says corporations, churches and shelters offer a holiday
safety net for the needy that didn't exist before.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are now things like the Empty Stocking Fund; the
churches are getting out and working. You can see it, you can feel
it,'' says Burton, who volunteers as a Salvation Army bell ringer
during the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Philip Bray, who operates SafeHouse Outreach Ministries
in Atlanta, says people seem more caring today, but he also thinks
there is a growing need.
</P>
<P>
   Bray says that he sees more women and children at homeless
shelters during the holiday and that homeless youngsters represent
a special problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids are bombarded with commercials about the newest toys,
and the fact that they might not be able to get those toys _ the
despair, the hopelessness _ it just seems to be compounded at this
time of the year,'' Bray says. ``My message is that we are rich
when we have joy, peace and loved ones in our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's the same message that Lee tried to spread this year.
</P>
<P>
   He sees his Santa role as a personal ministry and is convinced
that he's able to help the troubled youngsters who seek him out.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas may change but the need for compassion never does, he
says. ``I ask the Lord to speak for me, and he does.''

 &HT;    Finding rare, refined ways to subvert the mainstream
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Dec. 26.
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar, Sonia Murray, Kathy Janich, Doug Hamilton,
Miriam Longino and Shane Harrison
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If all you knew of pop music in 1999 was the video hit parade on
MTV's ``Total Request Live,'' you could easily assume that the year
was one of the shallowest ever: boy bands and Tommy
Hilfiger-approved Lolitas, surly rap-rockers and one-hit-wonder
acts milking the same watery formula for all it's worth. That's a
deceptive image, however, as inventive artists found new ways to
subvert the mainstream _ making complex but thoroughly entertaining
albums _ while refining the musical approaches that made their
names.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at 10 of those performers, whose CDs were rated by
staff music critics as the best of 1999:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Fiona Apple, ``When the Pawn ... '' (Clean Slate/Epic). Yeah,
the full 90-word title scans like flaky 10th-grade poetry, but the
22-year-old phenom has the musicianly goods most of her peers lack.
Snazzy piano chops and jazzy vocalese give Apple's self-absorbed
relationship rants and reveries a seductive sparkle. Vent, baby,
vent. (Steve Dollar)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Basement Jaxx, ``Remedy'' (Astralwerks). British duo
deconstructs the history of dance music, throwing it all back
together in unexpected ways. What's really impressive, though, is
that the twosome does it without sacrificing niceties such as hooks
and melodies. (Shane Harrison)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Beck, ``Midnite Vultures'' (DGC). A schizophrenic, funked-up
masterpiece, Beck Hansen's latest starts out as the phat soundtrack
to a throwdown at George Clinton's place, goes FM rock in the
middle and slinks to a close with the funniest falsetto-fueled
makeout song Prince never recorded. Think ``Odelay'' in a red
velvet suit and platform shoes. (Doug Hamilton)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Dixie Chicks, ``Fly'' (Monument). The Texas threesome proves
yet again that it is possible to pluck a banjo like Earl Scruggs,
stomp the stage like Sly Stone and be commercially successful on
country radio. (Miriam Longino)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Magnetic Fields, ``69 Love Songs'' (Merge). Underground pop
auteur Stephin Merritt's three-CD opus rivals the Artist for
voluminous indulgence, but there's little filler here. For Merritt,
the love song is a mutable concept, encompassing titles as
disparate as ``Nothing Matters When We're Dancing,'' ``Underwear''
and ``Chicken With Its Head Cut Off.'' (SH)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Meshell Ndegeocello, ``Bitter'' (Maverick/Warner Bros.).
Stripped of prominent bass guitar (``Rush Over'') and sass (``If
That's Your Boyfriend''), this still underappreciated R&AMP;B talent
stands bare and beautiful on her third album. It's our hearts she
exposes. (Sonia Murray)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Mos Def, ``Black on Both Sides'' (Rawkus). As casual observers
of rap watched mainstream favorites Master P go pop and Puffy's
sales go poof, the genre's best combination of smart lyrics and
creative production out this year gurgled almost unnoticed
underground. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  John Prine, ``In Spite of Ourselves'' (Oh Boy). Duets with
some of country/Americana's top female vocalists make this
collection of retro-country tunes burn like a naked light bulb.
``Back Street Affair'' with Patty Loveless is Porter and Dolly gone
bad. (ML)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tom Waits, ``Mule Variations'' (Epitaph). A busted-down
troubadour from the twilight zone of American myth, Waits is like a
hobo Stephen Foster stranded on Bourbon Street with a bullhorn and
a hip flask full of inspired jive. When he boasts, ``I got the
powder, but not the gun / I got the dog, but not the bun,'' you
know exactly what he means _ even if, really, you don't at all.
(SD)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Wilco, ``Summer Teeth'' (Reprise/Warner Bros.). The year's
most gloriously indulged pop album, in which a great Middle
American rock band transcends its niche, with glances back at the
Beach Boys and the Kinks. (SD)

 &HT;    An award-winning book by Emory University professor makes case
for segregated education in the Jim Crow South
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Before she became a Harvard grad and a celebrated
professor, Vanessa Siddle Walker grew up on a 90-acre farm, where
she learned to pick tobacco and feed hogs.
</P>
<P>
   She also learned another skill _ paying attention to people's
stories.
</P>
<P>
   It's a skill she easily mastered. After all, she comes from a
family of storytellers.
</P>
<P>
   She remembers jumping onto her grandmother's lap as a
2-year-old, saying ``Mama Emily, tell about that time when. . . .
`` And for her curiosity, Walker would be rewarded with grand
family tales that mixed joy, poetry and humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave me a sense of self and place and where I belonged in
history,'' said Walker. She eventually compiled many of the stories
and placed them in a family Bible she keeps in her Tucker, Ga.,
home.
</P>
<P>
   Walker is now getting attention for a story of her own. She was
recently named the winner of one of the nation's most prestigious
awards in higher education, the Grawemeyer Award, for a book that
challenges the belief that most black schools in the segregated
South had little worth.
</P>
<P>
   The award is administered by the University of Louisville (Ky.)
and comes with a whopping $200,000 prize.
</P>
<P>
   Walker's book, ``Their Highest Potential'' (University of North
Carolina Press, 258 pages, $15.95), examines a black school in
rural North Carolina that thrived before schools were racially
integrated.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, 42, an associate professor at Emory University, offers a
bold argument in her book that, in some ways, black students were
better off in segregated schools than they are now.
</P>
<P>
   She comes to this conclusion by chronicling the story of the
Caswell County Training School (CCTS), which operated in the
Piedmont area of North Carolina from 1934 to 1969. She focuses her
tale on the school's principal, N.L. Dillard, a leader who made his
students rich in learning though they were poor in just about
everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Under Dillard's leadership, CCTS became one of the few fully
accredited schools in the region (none of the white schools in the
area achieved this distinction). And CCTS students regularly won
academic honors.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Dittmer, chairman of the selection committee for the
Grawemeyer Award, said Walker's book was rigorously researched but
is also an inspirational page turner. He said it holds lessons for
today's educators.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the theories that's typical in education is that we
think if you throw money at the problem, it'll go away,'' Dittmer
said. ``Her book is a testimonial that there's something far more
fundamental than economics or resources.''
</P>
<P>
   It's called caring. Caswell's teachers _ and many parents _
routinely spent their own money to help students or to improve the
school. Walker observed such altruism personally. Her mother,
Helen, taught at CCTS and her father, the Rev. Theodore Siddle, was
a PTA president.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said she was shocked when she received news of the award.
She celebrated by sharing pizza and carrot cake with her Emory
colleagues and later pledged to donate some of the prize money to a
scholarship fund for Caswell County students.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, with the honor, Walker says, comes a measure of anxiety.
She fears that some people will misuse her book in an effort to
justify a return to segregated schools, something she does not
support.
</P>
<P>
   What Walker said she is attempting to correct in her book is a
historical distortion _ that black schools in the segregated South
had nothing to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Common belief suggests that under Jim Crow laws,
African-Americans were forced to go to inferior schools lacking in
resources and instruction. The landmark 1954 U.S. Supreme Court
case, Brown vs. Board of Education, abolished the doctrine of
``separate but equal'' schools, paving the way for school
integration nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   It also paved the way for the demolition of nurturing schools
like CCTS, Walker said. Under integration, the black educational
infrastructure _ black teachers, principals and schools _ was
``subsumed'' into the white school system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still had white superintendents, white school boards, white
teachers _ they fired many of the African-American teachers,'' she
said. ``So where African-Americans had power over how their
children were going to be educated in the segregated schools, they
lost much of that. People were making decisions about
African-American children who did not know them and perhaps did not
believe in what they were capable of doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The book has its critics. Harvard University's Gary Orfield, one
of the nation's leading advocates for school integration, says
Walker's book waxes nostalgic over a period that brutalized black
folks. Walker insists that Orfield ignores the academic research
that supports her claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are looking back at that time are seeing things
that were there, but they're not describing the whole picture,''
Orfield said. ``They remember the best of segregation and the worst
of desegregation.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who know Walker _ a tall, animated woman who switches
easily from academic jargon to down-home stories that reveal her
gift for mimicry _ say she is grounded enough to handle any
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   She lives in Tucker, Ga., with her husband, Melford, an
attorney, and their 6-year-old daughter, Sarah. Her home, like her
work, points to the past. An organ that sits in her foyer belonged
to her late mother. Her dining room set belonged to a great-aunt.
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline Jordan Irvine, a friend and Emory University
colleague, said Walker's rural upbringing stays with her in another
way. In the town of Yanceyville, N.C., where Walker was born, it
was considered taboo to brag. Walker explains much of her
accomplishments with a simple, ``I've been blessed,'' Irvine said.
``She went from rural North Carolina to Harvard, but she
understands that she didn't get there on her own.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker's humble nature also helped her while researching her
book, said Anthony Dillard, son of N.L. Dillard, Caswell's
principle.
</P>
<P>
   ``She came from well-respected people, so she inspired trust,''
said Dillard, whose father died in 1969. ``She has a very warm and
engaging personality. She could talk to anyone.'' Walker decided to
write the book a decade ago after hearing Caswell County residents
lamenting the news that the old county school was to be closed.
Their fond recollections stunned her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I literally remember being on 158 (U.S. 158 in Greensboro)
having this double take,'' Walker said. ``It hit me: `Nothing about
what they're saying matches with anything I know to be true in
academia.' My worlds collided.''
</P>
<P>
   Now those worlds have come full circle. Two pictures tacked on
Walker's office at Emory symbolize her journey. One is a poster
that celebrates the Brown decision. The other is a picture of
Dillard, standing nobly in front of the Caswell County Training
School with his staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brown decision was right,'' Walker said. ``I'm not
advocating a return to pre-Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she pointed to the picture of Dillard.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is the story that hasn't been told,'' she said.
``This picture can exist beside the other without contradiction.''

<P>
   --Why is it that 98 percent of the pictures in ski magazines

Whitefish (Mont.), Steamboat (Colo.), Vail (Colo.), Taos (N.M.),
Stateline (Nev.), Truckee (Calif.), Park City (Utah), Stowe (Vt.),
North Conway (N.H.) overlap only slightly with the Globe Ski

Greenville (Maine), Lennox, and Stockbridge?

skiing?
</P>
<P>
   --Notice who calls the skier's fashion shots these days? Yup,
snowboarders.
</P>
<P>
   --Does it seem to you that many ski areas are morphing into

dreamed that wintersports would be cast in the same light as timber
and mining, rather than as a socially-beneficial form of
recreation.''
</P>
<P>
   --Want your kids to be top ski racers? Get them off the groomed
slopes in their formative years.

<P>
   --The biggest waste of money in ski country? Now, as always:

   --Which reminds me, a warm winter is way worse than a cool
summer.
</P>
<P>
   --The least important ski area statistic? Vertical drop.
</P>
<P>
   --How to experience the downhiller's edge? Says former US Ski
Team member Doug Lewis: sit in a chair in the middle of the floor
and lean back, farther and farther until you're right at the
toppling point. Go back too far, you crash. Not far enough, you're
not even in the race.
</P>
<P>
   --How time schusses: It will be 15 years this winter since Billy
``Red Sleds'' Johnson became the first US skier to win an Olympic
gold medal in downhill.

   --And speaking of ski racing, it was America's winningest male,
Phil Mahre, who said if he had weighed more than 135 pounds in high
school he would have played football rather than ski.

   --And don't forget: The best day of the year to be on the slopes
is New Year's Day, the earlier the better.
</P>
<P>
   --Which raises a further point: If New Year's Eve is for
amateurs, what manner of yahoos are getting all worked up about the
``millennium'' New Year's celebration? One place I know I don't
want to be is the Killington access road.

MONTESSORI WOULD BE PROUD OF HER LEGACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Thursday, Dec. 30) 
(Eds: this is the next-to-last Mary Loftus column.) 
(lh) 
 By MARY J. LOFTUS    
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've had an education this year about a century-old, yet often
misunderstood, legacy: Schools based on the works of Dr. Maria
Montessori.
</P>
<P>
   Both my children are in Montessori schools for the first time:
My 3-year-old in an at-home preschool, and my 8-year-old son in an
elementary program for 6- to 10-year-olds. His second-grade teacher
recommended private school for him this year, sensing his need for
smaller classes, more independent projects and a creative
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Adam's school has a garden planted and harvested by the
students, a wide porch and sun-filled classrooms. But the small
touches are what make it stand apart: the chess set always in use,
the small kitchen where students wash and rinse their lunch plates
and silverware, the list of housekeeping chores. There are no
assigned seats, no grades and no standardized tests. Cooperation is
encouraged _ students often break up into groups to create a book
of nouns, or into pairs to quiz each other on spelling words. It's
such a stimulating environment, almost every parent who sits in on
a lesson says, ``Why couldn't my elementary school have been like
this?''
</P>
<P>
   At the fall harvest celebration, the children had pulled sweet
potatoes from the ground to make muffins and casseroles, and picked
plums from the tree in the corner of the play yard for jam. We
spread blankets on the ground and had homemade lemonade while the
children pulled each other around in a wagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you believe this?'' I kept saying to my mother, who was
visiting.
</P>
<P>
   She smiled and said, ``It's like the old one-room school house
your grandmother used to teach in. The older kids help the younger
ones, and you learn life skills as well as academics.''
</P>
<P>
   The Montessori method, developed almost a century ago by the
Italian educator, prides itself on respect for young students and
their innate desire for purposeful work. A common misconception is
that in Montessori schools the child can do anything he wants.
</P>
<P>
   As Adam says: ``Yes, I can do anything I want to, as long as
it's work.''
</P>
<P>
   At Sarah's preschool, she is one of five children taught by Ms.
Sharon in her home, a comforting, orderly place where morning
circle time often involves her playing guitar for a sing-along. The
students learn to wash the table, to pour water, to sound out
letters, and to name, in order, the planets, the days of the week,
the months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the students put on an impromptu puppet show from
behind a quilt thrown over the coffee table. There is quite a bit
of emphasis placed on outside play, manners, helping others and
moving gently.
</P>
<P>
   For Christmas, my children brought home bags from school filled
with apples and tangerines, walnuts and hazelnuts, homemade
cinnamon ornaments and paper chains, hand-painted pots with herbs
for the kitchen window.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is SO Montessori,'' I said, grinning at my husband.
</P>
<P>
   That long-dead Italian psychiatrist would be proud. In her
words: ``There must be provision for the child to have contact with
Nature, to understand and appreciate the order, the harmony, and
the beauty which are the basis of all sciences and arts.''

   CRUISE-WORKERS (Miami) _ These are boom times for the cruise
industry. Record numbers of passengers are packing bigger and
grander ships, providing record profits for the dominant lines.
Miami-based Carnival Corp., with 45 ships the world's largest
cruise company, is averaging $2.8 million a day in profits this
year, almost all tax-free because the company is registered in
Panama. But the benefits have been slow to trickle down to the
70,000 or so workers who keep the fleets running and passengers
dining and dancing. Though living conditions have improved, pay for
most has risen little, and some workers say their work has become
more grueling as ships have grown into floating cities bustling
with activity 24 hours a day. By Douglas Frantz.

   ``STUART LITTLE''
</P>
<P>
   Geena Davis, Hugh Laurie, Jonathan Lipnicki and with the voices
of Michael J. Fox, Nathan Lane, Chazz Palminteri, Steve Zahn
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Rob Minkoff
</P>
<P>
   PG _ 92 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Stuart, a white digital mouse, gets sprung from a mouse
orphanage and, in Minkoff's adaptation of the E.B. White children's
classic, goes to live with the Little family in their comfy
Manhattan brownstone. Mr. Little ( Laurie) and Mrs. Little (Ms.
Davis) regard Stuart as one of the family, but their young son,
George (Lipnicki), has trouble with the concept. ``He's not my
brother: he's a mouse,'' George tells relatives at a party to
introduce the newest Little, who is neatly dressed, mannerly and
three inches high.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, though, Stuart wins the boy over with his antics and
friendliness. Then during a model-sailboat race in Central Park, he
grabs the helm of George's craft, named the Wasp (one of several
nice little touches in this film), and guides it to victory.
``That's no mouse, that's my brother,'' George proclaims.
</P>
<P>
   But dissatisfactions remain. The Littles' cat, Snowbell (Lane),
doesn't want it spread around that technically speaking he's now
owned by a mouse. Feeling an empty place within him, Stuart wants
to find his real parents. Eventually these elements combine to work
against him when some street cats, drafted by Snowbell to do away
with Stuart, come up with a phony mother and father to get him away
from the Littles and set up a final game of cat and mouse.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: Some very small viewers could be bothered that Stuart
is usually but a gulp away from a cat.
</P>
<P>
   SEX: None.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY: Listen very hard for one mild epithet.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-5: Most children will be aware that the story is a
fantasy, but they will feel Stuart's sadness at being separated
from the Littles. In the end, though, they should weather all
tribulations nicely.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 6-8: Family values will play nicely.
</P>
<P>
   OVER AGE 8: Some viewers will find the film corny, but many
children through the age of 10 or so will be caught by the family
drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``ANNA AND THE KING''
</P>
<P>
   Jodie Foster, Chow Yun-Fat, Bai Ling, Tom Felton, Keith Chin,
Syed Alwi, Randall Duk Kim
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Andy Tennant
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 _ 140 minutes
</P>
<P>
   It's 1862 on the Bangkok docks, and riffling through her Siamese
phrase book Anna Leonowens (Ms. Foster) is annoyed not to find a
carriage waiting to carry her and her young son (Tom Felton) to the
palace of King Mongkut (Chow). Soon thereafter his majesty presents
a bigger inconvenience. Instead of one royal son to teach, Anna
will instruct a class full of his children. (He has 58, with 10 on
the way.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you punish me with imperialist schoolteacher?'' the
king's son (Keith Chin) asks his father. In Tennant's film, Anna,
the widow of a British officer, and Mongkut are in territory
claimed in 1956 by Deborah Kerr and Yul Brynner in ``The King and
I.'' What's more, they are without ``Shall We Dance?'' and the rest
of the Rodgers and Hammerstein score.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, adapting itself from Margaret Landon's novel ``Anna and
the King of Siam,'' the film relies on grand settings and a
multicultural sensitivity that allows the pair to spar over customs
and viewpoints in a more worldly fashion as they build their mutual
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   A prim, severe woman with attitude, Anna confronts the king's
repressiveness and the racism and deceitfulness of her own
countrymen. Dabbling in regional affairs, the British are
encouraging murderous incursions along the Burmese border to secure
their commercial interests. Aware of this, Mongkut finds himself in
tight political quarters and facing a coup attempt. No cause for
singing.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: Considerable and realistic. A young woman, having run
back to her lover after being taken as a royal wife, is caned
bloody. Later she and the young man are beheaded in a ritualistic
execution that spares viewers the actual sword swipes and in some
ways is the more chilling for it.
</P>
<P>
   SEX: None.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY: None.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 8: A bad idea. The violence and complexity will upset
and bore them.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 8-10: Again, remember that this is no musical. Given that,
many children will relate to such issues as parental control and
forces crowding the family from outside.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 11-14: Reactions will vary, but generally teen-agers take
to stories of rebellion. Political and moral issues will be of
interest, though the arguments are pedantic. Many viewers will want
Ms. Foster to lighten up a bit.

   ``BICENTENNIAL MAN''
</P>
<P>
   Robin Williams, Embeth Davidtz, Sam Neill, Oliver Platt,
Kiersten Warren, Wendy Crewson
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Chris Columbus
</P>
<P>
   PG _ 132 minutes
</P>
<P>
   When Andrew, a cheerful and industrious robot working as a
household servant, makes an intricate little wooden carving it
occurs to his master, called Sir (Neill), that Andrew has creative
impulses that go beyond the robotic.
</P>
<P>
   In a story adapted from Isaac Asimov's novel, the robot's
manufacturer says it's an anomaly and wants it back. But Sir
insists on keeping it to see what develops. Andrew, who looks
something like Williams, is particularly fond of Sir's 7-year-old
daughter, Little Miss (Hallie Kate Eisenberg). Years pass. Little
Miss has a crush on Andrew, now a clockmaker, but says she can't
invest her emotions in a machine and marries a mortal.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew wants his thoughts and feelings to show on his face so he
finds a genius (Platt) who mixes a batch of glop that when spread
across robotic facial wiring looks exactly like Williams. Andrew,
financially well-off from clock sales, becomes independent but
always yearns to be even more human.
</P>
<P>
   Generations pass into a science-fiction future. Andrew meets
Portia (Ms. Davidtz), Little Miss' granddaughter, and thanks to
regular upgrades he now has all the emotions to fall in love. But
to marry he needs to be recognized as human, so he petitions a kind
of United Nations to grant him certification. That raises several
interesting bioengineering issues (one elderly judge has as many
mechanical parts inside him as Andrew has human). Is there hope for
this couple?
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: When they are children, Little Miss' sister tries to
destroy Andrew by ordering him to jump out a window.
</P>
<P>
   SEX: Sir teaches Andrew the facts of life. ``People actually do
this, Sir?'' the robot asks. Years later he embraces the practice
enthusiastically and talks about it frankly. While he and Portia go
to bed, his performance is not recorded.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY: A little.
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-6: Too much for the very young.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 7-9: They should begin to understand Andrew's development,
which is not unlike what they are beginning to experience.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 10-12: Ditto only more so.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 13 AND UP: Not one to spare the sentimentality, Williams
waxes strong near the end of the film. By then, though, many
teen-agers (not all) will be hooked by other questions and
developments.

 &HT;    Commercial carpet market looking brighter
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The anemic commercial carpet market is showing signs
of a comeback as it heads into the new year.
</P>
<P>
   An upswing in office projects coupled with a wave of new
floor-covering products are pumping more life into the sector.
Sales of residential carpet have been strong, thanks to a healthy
housing market, but demand for commercial floor covering has been
soft this year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said fear of a possible recession earlier this year put
a dent in corporate demand. And corporate pocketbooks were
stretched thin because of Y2K preparations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commercial (carpet) market has been constantly looking
over its shoulder,'' said analyst Lorraine Miller of SunTrust
Equitable Securities.
</P>
<P>
   The sector, however, can look forward to a brighter 2000.
Corporate projects have picked up in the past two months, and that
translates into higher sales next year, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are forecasting a 5 percent increase in sales of
commercial floor coverings next year. Commercial sales this year
are projected at about $3.5 billion, a 1 percent decrease from
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the sluggish market for commercial flooring, Georgia's
carpet companies are wrapping up their strongest year ever. Total
sales are projected to rise 4 percent over last year's $15.4
billion.
</P>
<P>
   But Wall Street is concerned that the industry will not be able
to maintain the momentum. Share prices have plunged 40 percent this
year for the top two manufacturers, Dalton, Ga.-based Shaw
Industries and Calhoun-based Mohawk Industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the market is bothered by rising interest rates,''
said analyst John Baugh of First Union Securities. Rising interest
rates could put a damper on homebuilding and commercial
development.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has pushed rates higher this year to temper
the overheating economy. But investors fear the effect will be a
damper on home-buying, which would take a bite out of demand for
floor covering.
</P>
<P>
   Given the size and breadth of the carpet giants, Wall Street may
be overreacting, Baugh said. Still, manufacturers have been
steadily diversifying to rely less on one sector, a trend that's
most prevalent among commercial floor-covering products.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the commercial carpet industry has been dominated by
broadloom carpet and carpet tiles sold to corporate office
customers. But a new wave of products outside the traditional
carpet realm has emerged. Schools, health care and retail offer new
opportunities for growth, manufacturers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of surfaces out there that aren't carpeted,
and the industry is going after them in a big way,'' said Baugh.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Interface contends it has created a product that
will compete with vinyl tiles and hard flooring prevalent in
hospitals and schools. Both markets have shunned carpet because of
its tendency to harbor bodily fluids and germs.
</P>
<P>
   Solenium, which hit the market in the summer, features a new
type of synthetic fiber that resists stains and odor. It's
extremely easy to clean, Interface says, and it muffles noise
better than hard surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concentrating on the health care market first, but after
that we'll go after schools and retailers,'' said John Wells,
president and chief executive of Interface Americas.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high in those markets. For example, health care
facilities and schools spend $1.5 billion a year in floor
coverings, according to Interface. The company estimates that
Solenium could become a $100 million business for over the next
five years. First-year sales will reach nearly $5 million for 1999,
Wells said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Interface will continue to market its core
carpet-tile products to office buildings and other commercial
customers. Almost half of Interface's revenue comes from
modular-tile sales. The rest comes mainly from broadloom carpet,
interior fabrics and raised flooring.
</P>
<P>
   Modular tiles, which are popular because companies can replace a
section of the carpet instead of the entire room, are taking market
share from broadloom carpet.
</P>
<P>
   With a focus on carpet tiles, Dalton-based Collins &AMP; Aikman
Floorcoverings has grown from a small niche player to one of
Georgia's leading commercial carpet companies.
</P>
<P>
   Collins &AMP; Aikman, which built its business on recycled carpet,
has been targeting education and health care customers for years.
The manufacturer has recently entered the retail and high-end
corporate market.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Collins &AMP; Aikman bought two companies to expand its
product line. The acquisitions of Santa Ana, Calif.-based Monterey
Carpets and Nova Scotia-based Crossley Carpet Mills gave Collins &AMP;
Aikman a line of high-end products. The new broadloom offerings
mean the company can get a bigger share of corporate projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``In executive offices and boardrooms, companies want stylish
carpet,'' said Mac Bridger, president and chief executive at
Collins &AMP; Aikman. ``They would typically go to another manufacturer
for that. Now, we can fill a broad range of needs, from the
boardroom to the mailroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Mohawk has added both high-end and lower-price products. Mohawk
recently started making carpet tiles at a new mill in Dublin to
beef up its midpriced products. The tiles are being marketed to
schools, hospitals, airports and some retailers, said Frank
Procopio, president of Mohawk Commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Like smaller manufacturers, Mohawk and Dalton-based Shaw have
been beefing up fashion products to target the high-end corporate
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always tried to improve performance and value, but in
the past few years we've also concentrated on style and design,''
said Hal Long, executive vice president of Shaw Contract.
</P>
<P>
   A spate of hotel renovation and casino construction is spurring
demand for high-fashion carpet. The hotel sector is one of the
fastest-growing for Shaw's commercial business, Long said.
</P>
<P>
   The carpet industry has become more complex with the new
emphasis on design and fashion, noted Procopio. Unlike the
residential side of the business, in which the manufacturers strike
alliances with retailers, the commercial sales force has to
continually court interior designers and architects.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a project-by-project business. You can do a great job,
and the designers will remember that, but that doesn't mean you're
going to land the next project,'' Procopio said. ``You've got to
convince each team that you've got what they need on each job. A
lot of what we do comes down to relationships.''

 &HT;    Internet church sites help believers extend religion's reach
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _About two years ago, Pastor Mac Richard started
up a church in much the same way that houses of spirituality have
begun for millennia. Fifteen people joined in Richard's living
room. On that day, a gathering became a congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Lake Hills Church has grown to several hundred
members who attend Sunday services, where live music and Pastor
Richard's up-tempo sermons cater to a tech-savvy audience of teens
and twenty-somethings. Richard, an intense and friendly presence
with close-cropped blond hair and a wide grin, says Lake Hills
Church is going for something a little post-modern in its search to
attract new members to the flock. There is the clean, well-designed
Web site that looks like it could be a portal for an up-and-coming
startup. There is the Sunday service itself, playfully called
``Church 2.0.'' Glossy leaflets for the service invite would-be
parishioners to ``plug and play into meaningful worship.''
</P>
<P>
   The church has no brick-and-mortar foundation. Richard and two
other pastors work in a small office off Mopac and Loop 360. The
services take place at Westlake High School's Fine Arts Facility.
And increasingly, Pastor Richard's message is being delivered on
the Internet, where members stay in touch through an e-mail
newsletter and a continually updated Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're basically a virtual church,'' Richard said. ``We saw the
Web as a way to get the word out about what God is doing through
our church.''
</P>
<P>
   In the increasingly crowded din of the Internet, religious Web
sites are becoming nearly as popular as the mainstays of Web
traffic _ pornography and finance sites. Using nearly any search
engine, typing ``God'' will bring up nearly as many Web sites as
the word ``sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that religious organizations have flocked to the
Internet zealously, seeing it as a cheap, fast and extremely
effective way to educate members of their churches as well as bring
in new people curious to begin a spiritual journey that starts
online.
</P>
<P>
   Quentin Schultze, a researcher who for decades has studied the
link between religion and the media, said religion and the Internet
grew together with the explosion of the Net. ``If you look at the
history of film and television, you see that religious groups
tended to stay out of those media early. However, if you look at
the Web, you see just the opposite. It was the Web that really
launched the Gutenbergian revolution on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizations such as Lake Hills Church say they can reach many
more people on the Net and provide services like posting sermons
soon after they happen or even streaming video to those who are
disabled and can't make it to church every week.
</P>
<P>
   But, Schultze said, the danger to organized religion is that the
online evangelization of religion may further fragment major
religions. ``The Web tends to undermine existing religious
authority and institutions. In fact, a lot of what is happening
with the use of the Web is dissidents within a denomination who are
organizing.''
</P>
<P>
   Little churches, big Web sites
</P>
<P>
   Max Virdell, a large man with long brown hair, a full beard and
a minister's collar, entered the ranks of the ordained one day
after reading an article in Yahoo Internet Life magazine that told
him he could become a priest online.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, with divinity degrees from the World Christianship
Ministry and the Universal Life Church, he started up The Little
Church on the Web. Like the Lake Hills Church, Virdell has no
physical walls to his church. He maintains the site on a Sony
computer in his small North Austin apartment. He invites users to
pray, learn about his beliefs, and read sermons he may type up at 3
a.m. and post whenever the mood strikes him. Members of the Little
Church don't physically meet _ Virdell may speak in his site's chat
room or e-mail directly with those in need.
</P>
<P>
   Virdell, who is a great admirer of Billy Graham, fought and won
to get tax-exempt status for his virtual church from the state
comptroller's office. He also enjoys tax exemption from the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   The low-tech site, with its pictures of cherubs and multicolored
typefaces, is every bit as legitimate as the established churches
with the niceties of pews, stained glass and formal gathering,
Virdell says.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Virdell says he's always had a hard time finding the
right niche for his beliefs and he believes there are many like him
out there who may come away with a positive experience after
visiting the Little Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're in a great need of a spiritual revival in this
country,'' Virdell said. ``This is about having a relationship with
God. I think you can have that without getting dressed up on Sunday
and going to church.''
</P>
<P>
   For the small church, the Internet has opened up a way to
compete with churches that traditionally have had much larger
congregations and, consequently, larger budgets for promotion,
events and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   When the Ethical Society of Austin, a 5-year-old group that
meets regularly to discuss ethics across different religious
persuasions, started its Web site, it got the help of some IBM
workers who are part of the group. Gordon Fossum, the Webmaster of
the Ethical Society's site, said he posts information about
upcoming events and meetings and uses the site to educate people on
the little-known group. ``The Web site is an integrated effort to
reach out to folks. We're just a small group trying to explain to
people that you can exist in our society and act in an ethical
manner without God at the rudder of your moral sailboat.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard said Lake Hills Church has been able to reach a large
audience by spending a fraction of the cost for traditional
mail-outs. ``If you direct-mail 32,000 people, it can cost up to
$10,000. For a Web site, we spent about $750 to $1,000'' to set up
lhc.org. For that price, he said, his church has the potential to
reach an unlimited number of people.
</P>
<P>
   The site, Richard said, promotes the idea that church doesn't
have to be a once-a-week experience. ``We send out an e-mail letter
called `The Connection.' It's another way for people to feel
connected Monday through Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   IN Rome
</P>
<P>
   Several floors below the place where Pope John Paul II sleeps,
the Vatican's Web site is housed. It is run on machines called
Raphael, Michael and Gabriel. The woman who has run the site,
Sister Judith Zoebelein, is an American who sees it a mission to
evangelize via the Net. The organization she answers to even sounds
like a tech firm _ the Vatican Information Service.
</P>
<P>
   If you look around the Vatican's site, which appears with a
parchment-style background and is available in six languages, you
can find video, audio, archives, news and information about the
Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   Where the Internet started as a haven for pornography and arcane
information for tech-heads and researchers, Mark Kellner, author of
the book ``God on the Internet,'' says organized religions have
found they have to brave the Internet, and in the next century they
won't have a choice. ``If there's a church or church leadership
that isn't in step with what's going on online, I can't see how
they'll survive much beyond the next 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Kellner, who also writes for the Washington Times, said
organizations such as the Vatican expect to combat the negative
influences of the Internet by beating it with their own technology.
</P>
<P>
   He compares it to William Booth's use of drinking songs to
promote virtue. ``Booth says, `Why should the Devil have the best
music?''' Kellner said. ``I think the most perceptive people in
religion today should raise the question, `Why should the Devil
have the best Web sites?'''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to fostering communication, the Internet is also a
way to reinforce ``brand loyalty'' to a particular sect and to
evangelize on a scale that not even Billy Graham could physically
match. Kellner foresees the rise of ``cafeteria-style religion,''
in which many people will be able to wander through a spiritual
journey online, finding the pieces that will reinforce or enlighten
them on particular sets of beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Kellner hopes the sheer amount of information
available will create a better environment for religious dialogue.
``The biggest reason for religious prejudice is fear of the
unknown,'' he said. ``I hope it will create a world where we
understand each other a little better.''

 &HT;    GOP luring voters with school prayer initiative
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas Republican Party leaders are adding to the
March 14 primary ballot a question they figure could draw more GOP
voters to the polls: Should student-initiated prayer be allowed
before school sporting events?
</P>
<P>
   Ever since a New Orleans federal appeals court answered no to
that question earlier this year, and with the U.S. Supreme Court
scheduled to consider the issue next spring, the issue has become a
hot-button topic among Republican conservatives and the religious
right.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting earlier this month, the State Republican Executive
Committee voted to include the nonbinding ballot referendum _
called the Texas Religious Freedom Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, both parties have used such referendums to try
and boost turnout at their primaries _ on issues ranging from
gambling to term limits to concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue that goes to the very heart of the rights and
freedoms of Texas students guaranteed in the United States
Constitution,'' said Susan Weddington, head of the Republican Party
of Texas. ``We cannot allow an out-of-control, activist judiciary
to sacrifice our freedoms at the altar of politically correct,
modern-day liberalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Black, the Republican Party spokesman, said the
referendum is an opportunity for GOP voters to express their
opinion about a Feb. 26 decision by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals to ban voluntary, student-initiated prayer at school
sporting events. ``This is basic, basic freedom ... and this is an
opportunity for the public to have a voice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are two court decisions that grew out of complaints by
two families about prayers before football games in Santa Fe, Texas
_ a small town outside Houston. In May 1995, a federal judge
restricted voluntary student-initiated prayer and ruled that prayer
at athletic events and graduation ceremonies was permissible with
court-ordered restrictions on the content of those prayers.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the New Orleans-based appeals court banned
student-initiated prayer altogether at football games. An appeal of
that decision is before the U.S. Supreme Court. Tim Turner, a
Houston member of the State Republican Executive Committee, said
the referendum is intended only as a straw poll, and not to
influence the Supreme Court which is to hear the case within weeks
after the primary. ``It is an issue I think most Texans can relate
to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like other GOP officials, Turner predicts the referendum will
pass.
</P>
<P>
   While Tom Moon, a Houston member of the State Republican
Executive Committee who presented the referendum proposal with
Turner, has predicted the ballot question could draw additional
voter turnout, Travis County Republican Chair Becky Motal says she
has heard little discussion about it so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people are focused on the presidential race and the other
races that will be on the ballot,'' she said. ``We will have
probably 30 people on the ballot (in Travis County). It will be a
very active ballot.'' Texas Democratic party Chair Molly Beth
Malcolm on Thursday denounced the GOP referendum as ``a slap in the
face of religious freedom and spirituality.'' While most Democrats
support the right of students to initiate prayer at school
activities, she said, the referendum insinuates that Republicans
have a monopoly on religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cheap advertising ploy to rally right-wing
supporters.'' Malcolm said. ``Many Texans are deeply committed to
their religious faith and spiritual convictions, but they do not
condone the exploitation of religion for cheap political gain.''

CHANGE OF NUMERICAL ADDRESS CAUSES THE INABILITY TO ACCESS SOME WEB
SITES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Recently, I've had several Web sites that I just can't
access. It's not like they're obscure sites that went away _ I
can't get to AOL's Web site, or Hotmail! When I type these into my
browser, or click on a link, the Internet Explorer icon just spins
and spins until it times out. I also have Netscape Communicator,
and the same thing happens in that browser. What's going on?
</P>
<P>
   A: To fix the problem, launch Notepad and do a File, then Open
command. Navigate in the dialog box to the windows folder, then
change the ``Files of type'' drop-down box so it reads ``All
files.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, search through the windows folder for a file called Hosts
and open it. There, you'll find the names of various Internet
sites, followed by a series of numbers. Look for the names of the
sites that are giving you problems and delete both the name and the
number. Then, save the file.
</P>
<P>
   You should now be able to get to the sites. Why does this simple
action fix such a frustrating problem?
</P>
<P>
   The names commonly used for Web sites are actually aliases for
numeric addresses on the Internet, called IP addresses. The IP
address for my Web site is 130.80.29.206, and you could either type
that or www.dwightsilverman.com into your browser to get there.
</P>
<P>
   When you enter a Web address by name in your browser, your
software checks a computer at your Internet provider for the
numeric equivalent _ like looking up a phone number in the phone
book. It then connects to the site using the IP address.
</P>
<P>
   But if you have a Hosts file in your windows folder, Windows
will check there before it checks the computer at your provider. If
it finds an IP address for the site you entered or clicked on, it
will not bother checking with your provider.
</P>
<P>
   What happened in your case was that some program a while back
inserted those lines into the Host file, with the idea that it
would speed up your access to the site. If you installed America
Online on your machine, the installation process likely added that
particular line. If you upgraded to a new version of Internet
Explorer, then that's probably how you got the Hotmail entry.
(Microsoft owns Hotmail.)
</P>
<P>
   But AOL and Hotmail later changed the IP addresses for their
servers. When they did that, the old address became invalid.
</P>
<P>
   When you tried to go to those sites, your browser found the
now-incorrect entry in the Hosts file and wound up accessing a
non-existent server.
</P>
<P>
   Although the problem was a bedeviling one, it has revealed
something useful. If you know the IP addresses for sites you visit
regularly, you can enter them into the Hosts file yourself with
Notepad.
</P>
<P>
   Just follow the layout in the file to add them in the right
structure. When you go to those sites, your browser will check that
file first and get to the site quicker.
</P>
<P>
   You can determine the IP addresses for your favorite sites by
opening up an MS-DOS box and typing ping followed by the site's
name, e.g. ping www.chron.com. You'll then see the IP address of
the site.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've been interested in setting up my own home page with my
own name as a domain. I've been looking at various companies that
will do this for me, but they want an awful lot of money. Can I
register this myself?
</P>
<P>
   A: You sure can, and it will save you some bucks. But you do
need to have an Internet provider who's willing to host your site.
And even if you don't intend to put it up right away, you'll need
to get certain technical information from your Internet provider in
order to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Go to www.networksolutions.com and enter your desired domain
name in the Register a Web Address form. The cost is $70 for the
first two years, $35 for each year thereafter. The process is
simple and painless, and you can put it on a credit card.

 &HT;    Security officers at premium for New
 &HT;    Year's jobs
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Companies that haven't secured extra security guards
for New Year's duty by now can forget it. Those that do have extra
help are paying dearly for it.
</P>
<P>
   The double threats of possible Y2K computer glitches and fears
of terrorism have boosted business for security firms this year.
With the new year a week away, many of them are booked solid. Some
have even had to turn away business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not taking any more work for Y2K,'' said Randy
Blackwell, a scheduler for Wackenhut Security Corp. in DeKalb
County, Ga. ``Between now and the end of the year, it's going to be
hard to find enough (people) or get them trained in time. We're at
ground zero now in terms of hiring any extras to help us for Y2K.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia law requires five to eight days of training before a
person can become a security guard and a month of training and
several days of background checks for those who carry firearms.
</P>
<P>
   For security guards already on the job, Y2K work is a bonanza.
Many will be ringing in the New Year making overtime and double
time. Wackenhut's 500 Atlanta-area guards will get an average of
$20 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incentive to get them to work,'' Blackwell said.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Wackenhut will be billing its customers, which range
from high-tech firms to convenience stores, at a rate of $34 an
hour, double the normal rate.
</P>
<P>
   The hectic holiday in the security business is the latest
example of a region bulging with jobs and few people to fill them.
Security firms, retailers and other employers in the service
industries hired extra seasonal workers, triggering a drop to
record low of 2.8 percent unemployment in November for the metro
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest problems is with the unemployment rate so
low, we can't find many people. There's so many (competing) jobs
out there,'' said Kelly Davison, office manager for Pro-Tec
Security Services Inc. in Norcross. ``We've had to turn down a lot
of requests for service because we don't have the staff.''
</P>
<P>
   With only 25 guards, Davison said the company is focusing on
providing extra help to its longtime clients, which include car
dealers, churches, banks and a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Guardian Security, on Powers Ferry Road in Atlanta,
expects to pay a lot of overtime to its 240 guards to secure banks,
plants and office buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time of year, the wages are outrageous,'' says Paul
Santana, Guardian's vice president of operations. ``In order to get
people, we're paying $15 to $16. We're not finding enough people.''
</P>
<P>
   The urgency doesn't end with security guards.
</P>
<P>
   There's a hot pursuit for all sorts of workers: caterers, sales
clerks, waiters and waitresses. In downtown Atlanta, Mick's
restaurant and Wherehouse Music have help-wanted signs posted.
</P>
<P>
   Even baby sitters in metro Atlanta are commanding anywhere from
$20 to $50 an hour to work New Year's Eve. In other parts of the
country, the going rate for baby sitters on New Year's Eve has
reached the-unheard-of sum of $300 for the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``People that use our service have children and want to make
this a big event,'' said Terri Durshimer of TLC Sitters of Atlanta
in Smyrna.
</P>
<P>
   TLC is charging $20 an hour, double its normal rate. ``Some of
the caregivers are not willing to give up the night for family or
sentimental reasons,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who will be working will be in homes where
families are hosting parties and need someone to watch a group of
children, Durshimer said.
</P>
<P>
   One metro area couple said they are paying five times the normal
rate for a private sitter in their home.

Y2K FRENZY A TEST OF COMMON SENSE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After years of wild speculation, outrageous predictions of a
global silicon meltdown and dire warnings of a digital apocalypse,
the end of the 1999 is finally here. In a week, the world's
computers face the daunting task of figuring out what 00 means.
</P>
<P>
   The Year 2000 bug, better known as Y2K, has been squashed, at
least in the United States, according to most experts who've been
bird-dogging the situation. What happens overseas remains a
question, but it appears that the nation most reliant on high tech
has wrestled the problem to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   We hope, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Although calamities are unlikely, irritations are almost
certain. Chances are, someone's going to get billed for goods or
services dating back to 1900 _ with interest. The older PCs of many
home users will default to 1980 _ Year One in the internal clock
for the IBM-compatible computer _ which could play havoc with all
those old copies of Quicken that cheapskates have refused to
upgrade since, oh, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But most of these glitches will be found and dealt with in short
order, and life will go on.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PROBLEM HAS BEEN ADDRESSED &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's important to remember that most businesses and governments
have been coping with 2000 dates for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Reach into your wallet and pull out some credit cards. Note the
expiration dates that end in 00 or later. The banks and businesses
that issued them already are billing for 2000 dates. Some
businesses, the federal and some local governments currently are in
their 2000 fiscal years, so their computers also have been working
with double-aughts for some time.
</P>
<P>
   What is of most concern to those who've been watching Y2K play
out is the idea that people may overreact to something that's not
Y2K-related, but assume that it is.
</P>
<P>
   This is known as ``background noise'' _ the concept that there
are system failures happening to computers and the infrastructure
of everyday life all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose, for example, that a little after midnight on Jan. 1, a
car skids off an icy road somewhere and knocks down a power pole. A
neighborhood's power goes out, and residents there panic, thinking
power is out to the whole city.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Y2K had nothing to do with that accident _ unless the
driver is a computer technician who had one too many eggnogs while
celebrating a successful Y2K fix of his system _ but the folks left
in the dark don't know that. All they figure is, after months of
scare stories in the press and talking to that loony neighbor down
the street who's stockpiled water, guns and a year's worth of
canned peaches, the end obviously must be near.
</P>
<P>
   This whole problem could be aggravated by broadcasters who,
itching for some sexy Y2K news to report, decide to break into
regular programming to announce that power is failing everywhere
because of the Millennium Bug.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PERCEPTION CLOUDS REALITY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem related to Y2K, in other words, is likely to
be one of perception rather than reality. Grocery stores are not
likely to be out of food because their computers couldn't place
orders for them. Instead, they're more likely to be low on food
because people began hoarding.
</P>
<P>
   (Notice that financial analysts who cover the grocery industry
have quit talking about Y2K problems and now are talking about the
profits stores will make if the public goes bonkers. That should
tell you something ... )
</P>
<P>
   And the phone company, rather than warning that the telephone
network might not work, is urging people not to pick up the phone
at midnight to test it. The reason: Every time you get a dial tone,
even if you don't make a call, you use up a switch in the network.
There are a finite number of switches _ far fewer than the number
of actual phone lines _ and if too many people pick up the phone
out of curiosity at midnight, some will not hear dial tones.
</P>
<P>
   The most important thing to keep in mind about Y2K is a key
phrase in Douglas Adams' classic novel ``The Hitchhiker's Guide to
the Galaxy'': Don't panic. Think about what's going on and what the
other causes may be before you decide that the world is coming to
an end.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, there's another phrase you should keep in mind:
Be smart.
</P>
<P>
   There are some simple things you can do to shield yourself
against the irritating little things that are more likely to happen
as a result of Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   _ Read the main feature story on this page and use it to get
your own personal computer up to Y2K speed if you have not already.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you have records of your own that are tied to
electronically held records elsewhere, then make physical copies of
them. For example, if you do electronic banking, then print out a
statement to have in case there are disputes with your bank.
</P>
<P>
   _ Many ATMs will print out a bank statement for you, and if you
don't do electronic banking, this is a quick, simple way to get the
paperwork you may need.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep the receipts for every credit card transaction that may
show up on your January bill. And keep copies of all your December
credit card statements.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pay close attention to any legal or governmental documents
sent to you, such as license renewals, land records, tax bills and
so on. Keep an eye out for strange numbers or dates.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stay out of the yard of your nutty neighbor with the
guns-and-peaches stockpile for a few weeks. He's apt to be testy,
no matter what happens.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Season's greetings! Time to tickle another sacred
cow.
</P>
<P>
   The MetLife (formerly Pan Am) Building at Park Avenue and East
42nd Street is one of the worst disasters ever to befall the New
York cityscape. All New Yorkers acknowledge the universal truth of
this belief. None would dare challenge it, unless they are stupid,
desperate for attention or completely out of their minds.
</P>
<P>
   But Kivi Sotamaa, a young Finnish architect who is not mad, dumb
or sensationalistic, likes the MetLife Building very much. Sotamaa
may hesitate before saying so. He is 28, polite and lives in
Helsinki. He understands that the dreadfulness of the building is
an article of local faith. But on a recent evening, as we were
walking down Park Avenue, we looked up the gray cliff of MetLife's
concrete northern facade, and I found myself looking at the
architecture through his eyes. Att-r-r-ractive brute!
</P>
<P>
   Sotamaa, a finalist in the competition held earlier this year to
design a time capsule for The New York Times, admires the
proportions of the three-dimensional facade and the rhythm of its
windows. He likes the procession through the lobby to the
escalators that descend to the main concourse at Grand Central
Terminal. Most startling of all, Sotamaa appreciates the closure
that the building brings to the southern part of Park Avenue, and
to the grand boulevard of International Style office towers leading
toward it.
</P>
<P>
   Sotamaa's view will not be applauded by those who have long
considered this stretch of Park Avenue a sorry display of the
skinny glass boxes that began to take over the skyline in the
postwar decades. But to him, and to a surprising number of other
architects and city-lovers, the so-called Park Avenue Corridor is
the architectural heart of the 20th century. The corridor is the
crystallization of the New York myth, the soaring city of work and
ambition, where the sky is the limit and dreams are fulfilled. It
symbolizes New York's displacement of Paris as the century's most
vibrant City of Light.
</P>
<P>
   The corridor contains several individual buildings of
distinction from the 1950s to '60s, including the Seagram Building,
Lever House, 500 Park Ave. (originally the Pepsi-Cola Building) and
the Chase Building (originally the Union Carbide Building), the
last three designed by the New York firm Skidmore, Owings &AMP;
Merrill, and Philip Johnson's Russell Sage Foundation (originally
Asia House). James Ingo Freed's Park Tower, completed in 1981, is a
somber late addition to the group, while Frank Lloyd Wright's 1958
Mercedes-Benz (originally Jaguar) Showroom offers a quirky footnote
to the ramp of the Guggenheim Museum's rotunda.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the corridor's power lies in the aggregate, in the
mix of lesser buildings with well-known landmarks. At the century's
outset, long before the first curtain wall was actually hung,
architects used to dream about the gleaming cities that glass would
enable them to build. Here, the dream was realized. It looks
particularly misty at this time of year, when the sun sets early
and the street shimmers with holiday sparkle. Like towering ice
palaces, the buildings glint with silver, white and gold.
</P>
<P>
   The term International Style was coined by Philip Johnson and
Henry Russell Hitchcock for an exhibition in 1932 at the Museum of
Modern Art. Though the show included a few United States buildings
and established Johnson as an arbiter of American architectural
taste, the term became mainly linked to the work of European
modernists like J.J.P. Oud, Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier and
Alvar Aalto. In the postwar decades, the International Style became
shorthand for the steel and glass towers like the Seagram Building,
the supreme example of the genre, designed by Mies and Johnson in
1957-58.
</P>
<P>
   Mies described his own aesthetic as one of ``almost nothing,'' a
paring down of form to the discreet articulation of construction
and enclosure. Walls were reduced to the transparent membrane of
the glass curtain wall. Structure was expressed on the exterior by
the application of nonstructural I-beams. This approach exemplified
the architect's belief that less is more. It enlarged the artistic
significance of proportion, scale, quality of materials and
refinement of detail.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, it was said that these buildings represented a
rejection of history. In fact, modern architects merely declined to
use historical period styles. No movement has ever set down roots
into deeper historical soil. Mies himself was strongly influenced
by Karl Friedrich Schinkel, the exemplar of neo-Classicism in
19th-century Berlin. The rationalism associated with the style
harked back to the ideal of scientific objectivity promoted by the
18th-century Enlightenment. From the 19th-century realist movement
came such modernist beliefs as truth to materials and the rejection
of showy display. Above all, the International Style was grounded
in 19th-century historicism: the view that each epoch should
produce a distinctive architectural style.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Will of an Epoch
</P>
<P>
   According to this linear view (restated by plaster casts in
countless turn-of-the-century museums), Egyptians, Romans and the
medieval French had each produced a style. Therefore, the modern,
industrial age should have its own manner of building. As Mies
famously said, architecture is the will of an epoch translated into
space. As an embodiment of this belief, the International Style can
be seen as the 19th century's last gasp. Though it became a symbol
of the 20th-century metropolis, in fact it represented an
aestheticized version of the train sheds, factories, bridges and
other engineering marvels of the 19th-century industrial city. Far
from rejecting history, in other words, the architects of the Park
Avenue Corridor were actually behind the times. They developed the
perfect vernacular for an era in urban history that had already
begun to wane by the time their buildings arose.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in the International Style has been building in the
last decade. In 1992, Terence Riley, now chief curator of the
Modern's architecture and design department, remounted the museum's
1932 show at Columbia University. The same year, Hani Rashid, a
professor at Columbia's architecture school, chose the Park Avenue
Corridor as one of three Manhattan sites for a design project in
his studio. This past term, Michael Maltzen, an architect based in
Los Angeles, led a group of students at Harvard's Graduate School
of Design in a similar project based on Craig Ellwood's classic Art
Center College of Design in Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Park Avenue Corridor's buildings have reached the
age when they qualify for landmark designation, which would afford
them the protection of the city's preservation laws. This is a
moment of irony: those laws were enacted partly to curtail the
proliferation of modernist buildings and the loss of the fine old
masonry edifices that they replaced. Like them or not, however, the
historic and aesthetic value of these buildings must now be
reckoned with. Interpretations of their meaning must be rethought.
</P>
<P>
   Is it really true, for example, that the International Style
contradicted public taste? This has been one of the hoary myths on
which preservationists and postmodernists have relied since the
1970s. But in the early 1960s, the International Style was a symbol
of urban sophistication in many Hollywood movies, as accurate a
barometer as we have of popular desires. In ``Breakfast at
Tiffany's,'' ``The Best of Everything'' and even several Doris Day
comedies, the glass tower epitomized worldly aspiration and
success.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is the collision between preservation and the
International Style more apparent than in the space that once
served as the lobby for 500 Park Avenue. Originally designed for
Pepsi-Cola, now PepsiCo, which subsequently sold it to Olivetti, it
is a paragon of excellence in corporate design. Furnished simply
with a reception desk, the lobby was a rectangular bubble of space
on which the entire building seemed to float. Two years ago, the
gorgeous space was chopped in two to house a pair of retail
establishments. (Lever House is more fortunate. The building's
owners have hired David Childs of Skidmore, Owings, &AMP; Merrill to
restore the exterior and to design new office interiors in keeping
with Gordon Bunshaft's original design.)
</P>
<P>
   The desecration of 500 Park raises the issue of how effectively
landmark laws can protect glass buildings. Since the main effect of
the glass is to dissolve the boundary between inside and outside,
it makes little sense to preserve only exteriors. But interiors,
which are usually bland as well as subject to the changing needs of
owners and tenants, scarcely seem worth designation. At the same
time, when office lighting fixtures are replaced without
sensitivity, the effect on the facade can be ruinous.
</P>
<P>
   Landmark experts face the same question that the Museum of
Modern Art has had to tackle. Does modernism refer to a finite
historical period, or to an ongoing tradition of innovation? In its
plans for expanding the museum, the Modern has more or less dodged
the issue by hiring an architect (Yoshio Taniguchi) whose work,
while contemporary, is rooted in Miesian ideas. This approach makes
sense for an institution that wishes to show that it is both
receptive to the present moment and respectful of its past. But it
won't be of much use to preservationists who hope that the period
could be historically bracketed, any more than terms like Late
Modern or neo-Modern accurately describe architects like Freed,
Richard Meier, Charles Gwathmey or Rafael Vinoly, whose work
extends what they themselves regard as an unbroken line of
historical development.
</P>
<P>
   Essence Over Style
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if the modern movement was historicism's last gasp,
then the whole concept of identifying works by period and period
styles has become fairly pointless. A curatorial conceit, the term
International Style never meant much to the architects who were
chosen for the Modern's 1932 show. To most of them, for that
matter, modernism was not to be seen as a style, but rather the
rejection of style in favor of essence. Mies, in fact, described
his work as building art (Baukunst); to him, the word architecture
was overly freighted with superfluous connotations.
</P>
<P>
   My view of this work is partly nostalgic, partly polemical. At
52, I'm old enough to recall New York as the city where, in the
1960s, the most creatively ambitious work in the world was
happening. Today, I'd like to see the city rescued from the
suburban rage for safety that postmodernism ushered in.
</P>
<P>
   I can't see the MetLife Building with any pretense of
impartiality. Much of the meaning it held for me evaporated when
they banned helicopter flights from the roof and later when Pan Am
itself shriveled away. The airline conferred on the building a
unique set of relationships between it, the city and the rest of
the world. To many young baby boomers, Pan Am signified the idea
that United States hegemony in the postwar world was essentially
benign. The airline's blue and white globe logo represented freedom
_ the power to go anywhere, be anyone, lose oneself in the clouds.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   You could arrive at the building by subway, train, taxi or on
foot, take the escalator from Grand Central's concourse up to the
lobby, ride the elevator to the roof, grab a helicopter to Kennedy
Airport and board a jet clipper overseas. This sequence was the
closest the city ever came to realizing the 1920s dream of airships
moored to the tops of skyscrapers. The connection to Grand Central
was critical: a pylon to the glory of 20th-century travel soared
above a triumphal monument to the earthbound transport of an
earlier day. The building implicitly enlarged the meaning of Grand
Central to include the place of New York in the nation and the
place of the nation in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Today, air travel is not something to look forward to, flight
attendants have lost their glamour, the depleted ozone layer has
been identified as carcinogenic and United States global dominance
sometimes calls forth images of exploited Third World workers. Yet
the MetLife Building nonetheless retains intrinsic merits. For a
start, it bears the signature straightforwardness of the Bauhaus
founder Walter Gropius, one of three architects who collaborated on
the design. Gropius preferred collaboration to individual artistic
statement. Even Miesian elegance was superfluous to him. Japanese
vernacular architecture was his aesthetic ideal. It is expressed
here in the uniform prefabricated spandrels, the ribbon windows and
the exposed concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Like Gio Ponti's Pirelli Tower in Milan (another transportation
landmark), the lozenge form of the floor plan expresses the service
core at the center, containing the elevators that make tall
buildings possible. The plan also created a faceted facade that
diminished the impression of bulk. Compared with the Pirelli Tower,
the MetLife Building lacks finesse. In compensation, the building
offered public access: to its generous lobby spaces, the rooftop
heliport, and the Sky Club restaurant on the penthouse floor.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbies were destroyed in 1987 by Warren Platner's
remodeling: a parade of golden headdresses, earrings, ferns and
limp hankies evidently conceived to evoke a floor-show version of
an Aztec wedding festival at a fifth-rate Las Vegas casino. The
building's true core, however, is ethical and remains intact. It is
the surrender of the individual voice to a collective cultural
expression.
</P>
<P>
   A Different Angle
</P>
<P>
   Architects younger than I am _ like Sotamaa, Lindy Roy, Rashid,
Lise Anne Couture, Jesse Reiser and Nanako Umemoto, who were joined
by the critic Jeffrey Kipnis at a recent meeting with Philip
Johnson at the Seagram Building _ see the slice of architecture
along Park Avenue from a slightly different angle. They weren't
around when buildings like the Ford Foundation, the Guggenheim
Museum, the CBS Building and Lever House were new. They can't
recall a time before the distinction had broken down between art
and art history, and the city was more inclined to accept
Whitehead's idea that the business of the future is to be
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they've managed to remain insulated from the
hostility that International Style buildings still arouse. Most of
them teach in schools where the work of Eero Saarinen, Mies and
Bunshaft is studied and venerated. They are able to see well beyond
the glass box surface into deeper levels of meaning and value. None
of these architects are reworking the International Style. If
they're united by any aesthetic, it is the polymorphous one still
being forged with the aid of computer software. But they appreciate
the intellectual rigor that animates this work and the solidarity
among the architects who produced it.
</P>
<P>
   Many young designers have learned to look at Manhattan through
the lens ground and polished by the Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas.
In his 1978 book ``Delirious New York'' and other writings,
Koolhaas resisted the standard, simplistic pro or con: rational on
the one hand, sterile on the other. Instead, he showed that in
pursuit of a rational city modern architects had brought forth a
highly surrealistic one. In the reflections of the crystal canyon,
the world of external reality merges with the subjective realm of
ambition, fantasy and desire.
</P>
<P>
   No design in recent years has given firmer shape to this idea
than Christian de Portzamparc's LVMH Tower at 19-21 E. 57th St.
Described by Portzamparc as an homage to the city of glass, the
23-story tower features a faceted glass skin that unfolds like a
crystal flower. While the tower can't possibly be mistaken for an
International Style skyscraper, LVMH responds to the context of the
mythical New York where modernity took root. And it is the first
blossom that this root has sent forth in many years.
</P>
<P>
   So here's my holiday toast to our great city. Architecture is
back. May it stick around a while.

TAKING CARE OF THAT TURN-OF-THE-CENTURY BUG SHOULDN'T BE TOO
DIFFICULT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's the bad news: If you have not yet tackled the issue of
making your home or small-business personal computer ready for
2000, your time is almost up.
</P>
<P>
   This is one deadline that's hard and fast.
</P>
<P>
   But there is good news: Fixing Y2K problems in a personal
computer is not difficult. It just takes a little time and an
organized approach.
</P>
<P>
   Computer industry experts say that when it comes to the PC the
Y2K bug is more of an annoyance than anything else. A personal
computer is not going to become a nonfunctioning block of metal,
glass and plastic Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it may report dates oddly. Programs that rely heavily
on dates, if they are not Y2K-compliant, may alter important data.
</P>
<P>
   The problems, however, should be rare. Experts estimate that 90
percent of PCs can handle 2000 as a date. In some older computers,
users may have to correct the date manually every time they boot
up, rather than having the system handle it for them.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Y2K bug has been a reality for personal computers
since the creation of the original IBM PC in 1981, the PC industry
only began tackling the problem in earnest in the mid-1990s. Most
computer companies say that products purchased in 1997 and on
should be considered Y2K-compliant.
</P>
<P>
   The problem in a personal computer begins in the interaction
between two components _ the BIOS and the real-time clock.
</P>
<P>
   The BIOS, which stands for Basic Input Output System, handles
the simplest functions of the computer. It is the BIOS, for
example, that starts the process of launching operating systems
such as Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The real-time clock's function is to keep track of the time and
date. The root of the Y2K problem in a PC lies in the fact that the
year is only expressed as two digits in the real-time clock.
</P>
<P>
   When the computer is turned on, the BIOS gets the time and date
information from the clock. When software programs need to know the
date for some function, they ask the BIOS, which then supplies the
century information.
</P>
<P>
   In the earliest PCs, BIOSes didn't ``know'' about the 21st
century. For these systems, the real-time clock's turnover to the
year 2000 made no sense.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike bigger computers, PCs usually don't interpret 00 as
1900. On those machines that can't handle 2000 as a year, users
likely will see Jan. 1, 1980, which is considered ``Year Zero'' for
personal computing.
</P>
<P>
   The problem does not affect Apple Computer's Macintosh per se,
but some Macintosh software may have Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, computer makers have come up with fixes for the
BIOS problems, and they are making use of the Internet and its
World Wide Web to deliver those fixes. Most of what you need you
can find online at specific vendors' Web sites _ nearly all have a
special Y2K area set up to discuss the readiness of their products.
</P>
<P>
   Software and hardware manufacturers say there is a series of
steps PC owners can take to make sure 2000 rolls around smoothly:
</P>
<P>
   Begin by determining whether your personal computer's hardware
is capable of handling 2000 as a valid year.
</P>
<P>
   Check first with the maker of your PC. Many computer makers have
posted on their Web sites Y2K-compliance information about their
products. In some cases, every machine they've ever made is listed.
</P>
<P>
   If you own an off-brand PC, or one that was home-built,
determine who made the motherboard _ the main system board in the
computer _ and contact that vendor. Many clone systems come with a
manual for the motherboard that should provide contact information.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't determine who made the motherboard, you can at
least find out the maker of the BIOS. When your PC is first turned
on, the brand and model number of the BIOS appear briefly.
</P>
<P>
   You can always try to determine on your own if your PC is
Y2K-compliant with a simple and obvious test. Advance the system
clock to 11:55 p.m. on Dec. 31, 1999, then shut down the computer.
Turn it back on 15 minutes later. If the date is shown as Jan. 1,
2000, then the hardware is ready for the new century.
</P>
<P>
   There also are software programs that will test a PC. One of
them is available as a free download from the National Software
Testing Laboratory at www.nstl.com/html/nstly2k.html.
</P>
<P>
   Computers that won't handle 2000 don't necessarily have to be
doorstops. Some BIOSes can be upgraded to make them compliant _
manufacturers make these patches available online or through
technical support services.
</P>
<P>
   For computers that have BIOSes that can't be upgraded, there are
software drivers that can be inserted into a system's config.sys
file. These patches can be used with very old PCs _ in some cases,
they will work with computers that use the Intel 80286 processor,
circa 1986.
</P>
<P>
   A generic version of the driver is available from some
commercial software publishers. Symantec's Norton 2000 program
includes one, for example, and it's also available as a free
download at www.symantec.com/sabu/n2000/n2000ret/.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do the same kind of research on your operating system. All of
Microsoft's operating systems have some problems _ mostly minor _
with 2000 as a year.
</P>
<P>
   And that includes Windows 98, the company's newest. In fact, one
of the marketing draws for the release earlier this year of Windows
98 Second Edition was that it included Y2K patches that have been
issued for Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also has released stand-alone Y2K patches for Windows
95, 98 and NT, as well as including them in larger updates known as
service packs. But MS-DOS and Windows 3.1 are considered legacy
operating systems and Microsoft has released only limited fixes for
them. Consider upgrading to one of the newer versions if you are
still using DOS or Windows 3.1.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, it's important to make sure you have the latest patches
for your operating system. Several fixes in the latest service pack
for Windows NT 4.0 are required to bring it into Y2K compliance,

<P>
   The most recent versions of IBM's OS/2 operating system, Warp 3

</P>
<P>
   Most versions of Unix either are or can be made Y2K compliant,
including Linux, the increasingly popular Unix-like operating

finance program, your e-mail software and any productivity titles
you use, such as a word processor or a spreadsheet.
</P>
<P>
   A small business owner would look at accounting and inventory
packages, spreadsheets and databases, word processors and

systems, make sure you have the most recent upgrades to your
current applications.
</P>
<P>
   _ Check the documents you've made with those applications.
</P>
<P>
   Are you using two digits to indicate the year in your

<P>
   _ Be wary of any Y2K ``fixes'' that may be sent unsolicited to
you via e-mail. Anti-virus experts warn users to expect a flurry of
malicious software masquerading as Year 2000 patches.

<P>
   In general, it's a good idea to delete any executable files that
you didn't request, even if they come from people you know. Many
viruses replicate by attachments sent by e-mail in a way that the
sender doesn't know it's happened.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true of unsolicited Microsoft Word documents, which
can contain macro viruses. If you receive an unsolicited Word
document, delete it and ask the sender to re-transmit the
information in text-only format.

`SEX': A GENTLE NOSTALGIA TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.)

 By D.J.R. BRUCKNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ If it helps a writer to know a lot about her subject,
Mae West brought great authority to her first play, ``Sex,''
written and first produced in New York in 1926. The writing is not
as accomplished as it is in some of her later film scripts, but
there are enough characteristic West lines to let you know who the
author was, and it was good enough to get her tossed into jail in
1927 as the creator and star of an indecent public performance. As
a publicity stunt the trial was perfect; from then on she was a
star whatever she did.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the text of the play was lost for 70 years. So the show
was never revived in the city. But now the Hourglass Group has
resurrected it in a production at the Gershwin Hotel _ a setting
that has the '20s written all over it _ under the direction of
Elyse Singer. It is smart, funny and even a little irreverent to
West's creaky plot and often corny dialogue. Ms. Singer is one of
the three founders of Hourglass, and the other two, Nina Hellman
and Carolyn Baeumler, play key roles. Hourglass itself is devoted
to bringing attention to the work of women, but the production is
by no means a captive of the playwright.
</P>
<P>
   West's plot is right out of the pulps. A bright young prostitute
in Montreal, Margy (originally played by West, here by Ms.
Baeumler), determined to get out of her racket and marry well,
takes the advice of a British naval officer to ``follow the
fleet.'' That takes her to Trinidad, where she meets the naive
scion of a rich family from Greenwich, Conn. He proposes to her and
whisks her home to his parents' sprawling mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Then the plot thickens. One of Margy's Montreal boyfriends had
seduced an American society matron _ out slumming in a town where
she wouldn't be recognized _ to follow him one night to Margy's
apartment, where he slipped her a mickey and stole her jewels.
Margy and her naval officer friend return home, find the comatose
woman and help her get back to her hotel. Of course, the woman
turns out to be the mother of Margy's fiance. And Margy's sailor
friend, who truly loves her, turns out to have been invited as a
house guest by the fiance. The matron's seamy escapade might be
revealed and ... well, you can write the rest of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only difference between us is you can afford to give it
away,'' Margy says to the trembling mother. There are many more
needless complications here, but since most give rise to comic
situations and good lines, what's to object to?
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Baeumler is alluring and almost maliciously provocative as
Margy, even if she displays little of the sense of mockery
(including occasional self-mockery) that made West such a natural
show-stealer. Ms. Hellman, first as Margy's friend Agnes, a fellow
prostitute miserably nostalgic for her rural religious past, and
then as Marie, a maid in the Greenwich mansion, creates two comic
characters so distinct it is hard to believe they are played by the
same woman.
</P>
<P>
   Agnes, who would make a fitting bride for a scarecrow, all fray
and no nerve, has a voice like failing brakes on a New York subway
train, but louder. Marie, all curves, seduction and impertinent
curiosity, purrs in a French accent that gets a laugh about every
second word.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Darlow, a Broadway veteran, is hilarious as the society
dame on a lark and even funnier as the frightened mother trying to
evade the consequences. T. Ryder Smith, as Margy's naval admirer,
Lt Gregg, is virtually a compilation of early American film
depictions of British men; he seems to extend the notion of stiff
upper lip to his neck, back, knees and elbows, to wonderful effect.
And Andrew Elvis Miller as Margy's clueless young fiance is a
delicious contrivance; he manages to look like a wax mannequin that
talks like a book, with so much sincerity he makes honesty seem
quite obscene. Little else in the play sounds obscene at all,
despite the long strings of innuendo that always marked West's
writing and speech.
</P>
<P>
   Hourglass surrounds the acts of the play with snippets from the
1927 trial of West, which is probably a good idea because few in
the crowd this company attracts can have been 10 years old when
West died in 1980 and probably have little idea how the legend
began. The scene in a hotel cafe in Trinidad gives the troupe a
chance to liven up things with some '20s songs, and sound tracks by
Steven Bernstein's Sex Mob thread modern jazz, intelligently
anchored in that era, through the whole evening.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, this show is good comedy, if sometimes at the
expense of the script, and for those who can remember Mae West
alive, it is also a gentle nostalgia trip.

 &HT;    Pruning of story for big screen reduces `Cider' appeal
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ John Irving so despised last year's adaptation of
``A Prayer for Owen Meany'' that he refused to allow the filmmakers
to use his name or that of the book and its characters, resulting
in the rechristened ``Simon Birch.''
</P>
<P>
   The acclaimed novelist took a much more active role in
translating ``The Cider House Rules'' to the screen. Irving wrote
the screenplay himself and reportedly demanded director and cast
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Academy Award-nominee Lasse Hallstrom, the film is
the most successful adaptation of one of Irving's works since
1982's ``The World According to Garp.'' However, the 500-page-plus
historical novel proves to be an unwieldy subject even for its
author.
</P>
<P>
   The sweet, touching drama is very much a surface reading of the
epic coming-of-age tale about an orphan, Homer Wells (Tobey
Maguire), who is searching to find his place and purpose in the
world. The 1985 novel's time frame has been condensed, and a number
of subplots were trimmed because of the demands of cinematic
storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, ``The Cider House Rules'' retains the central story
but lacks a strong narrative structure. The plot doesn't really
kick in until the second half of the film.
</P>
<P>
   Homer has been raised in pre-World War II-era Maine by Dr.
Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine), who heads the St. Cloud's orphanage.
Trained as a doctor by Larch, who treats Homer like a son, the
young man helps deliver unwanted babies and looks after the
abandoned children. However, moral qualms prevent Homer from
helping Larch with the illegal abortions that he performs, despite
the latter's reasoning that he is saving lives by preventing women
from being butchered by back-alley abortionists.
</P>
<P>
   When a young pilot, Wally Worthington (Paul Rudd), and his
pregnant girlfriend, Candy Kendall (Charlize Theron), visit St.
Cloud's for an abortion, Homer seizes the chance to leave with the
couple. He happily finds work in the apple orchard owned by Wally's
family, producing cider with Mr. Rose (Delroy Lindo) and his crew
of migrant workers after Wally goes off to war.
</P>
<P>
   Larch discovers he is to be ousted from the orphanage and wants
Homer to return and take his place. Having found love and
acceptance, Homer refuses _ until a series of difficult situations
force him to make tough decisions about the direction his life will
take.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cider House Rules'' is classic Irving, featuring the
colorful characters and tragic twists of fate that are hallmarks of
the author's work. The story is warm and gentle, but conservative
viewers may be turned off by its pro-choice stance on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Maguire (``Pleasantville''), one of Hollywood's best young
actors, does a fine job as Irving's wide-eyed hero. British actor
Caine adopts a convincing American dialect, and the lovely Theron
(``The Astronaut's Wife'') delivers her most appealing performance
to date.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the novel may still be disappointed. The story has lost
much of its flavor by being reduced to its core.

 &HT;    Dreams of a new life turn tragic in `Boys'
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If Matt Damon dropped 50 pounds, he would look a
lot like Hilary Swank. In the redneck horror story ``Boys Don't
Cry,'' the gamine Swank plays a 21-year-old man-boy who's full of
sweet swagger and has a mouth that stops traffic. Her Brandon Teena
is cadaver-thin, marking a powerful jawline that accommodates
water-balloon lips. When he smiles, those lips part like soft
curtains to reveal a toothy colonnade a mile wide. She, er, he, is
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   In this true story that unfolded in Nebraska in 1993, the
``man'' Brandon Teena (who was born the woman Teena Brandon; stick
with me) racked up an unlikely streak of female paramours, bundled
together with a string of brazen lies. Teena, we're told, wrestled
with a sexual identity crisis. At one point in the film she insists
she's a he-- maphrodite; at another she says she wants a sex-change
operation.
</P>
<P>
   She's complicated, but ``Boys Don't Cry'' unfortunately makes no
effort to suss out this unisex question mark. We have to take her
issues for whatever they may be (was she gay? bi? abused as a
child? dying to see what the men's room looks like?) without
motivational signposts.
</P>
<P>
   The film, directed and co-written with studied compassion by
Kimberly Peirce, hews closely to the story told in last year's
documentary ``The Brandon Teena Story,'' though it telescopes
chronology and twiddles some facts. This may annoy viewers,
especially the lesbian overtones Peirce fastens to her version.
</P>
<P>
   What makes ``Boys Don't Cry'' so compelling _ makes you want to
take the journey wherever it may go no matter how horrible _ is a
uniformly magnetic cast that animates the grungy real-life
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by a linear body shy on contours, Teena accomplished her
subterfuge with a transformation into a beguiling androgyne. She
cut her hair, strapped down her breasts, stuffed a sock in her
Levi's, and put some schwing in her step. (She becomes a bird-size
Damon.) Brandon's absolute lack of five o'clock stubble evidently
raised no flags with the smitten young women with whom he rubbed
cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   There's no need for our suspension of disbelief; Brandon's
conquests really happened, with the girls none the wiser. Swank's
remarkable De Niro-esque metamorphosis, which has been trailing
Oscar buzz for months, erases your incredulity. You can see why
these girls fell for Brandon. Knowing what we know, it's
heartbreaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys'' doesn't show us Brandon's early chain of girlfriends.
It focuses on his last relationship with a girl named Lana, played
by druggy-faced Chloe Sevigny with a tough, languid fervency.
Sevigny gives a terrific performance, so cool and organically
nuanced, its impact registers as an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys Don't Cry'' would be a stronger movie had the filmmakers
walked us up to the point that Teena decided to become Brandon.
Instead it begins with her leaving Omaha for rural Falls City,
where she plans to escape a lie-littered past and start fresh. The
excitement in her eyes portends the euphoria and danger that awaits
her. She glows with the high of liberation. She has lived her life
in parentheses, and now, at last, she's going to live out loud.
</P>
<P>
   In Falls City Brandon befriends a rough group of partiers that
includes Lana, belligerent ex-convict John (a frightening Peter
Sarsgaard) and dim-witted Tom (Brendan Sexton III in his best
performance). These are bored people, marking their time with fast
driving and heavy drinking (having these Nebraskans drink Austin's
Celis beer is a gaffe, even if the film was shot in Dallas). Not
until Brandon's past catches up to him do they suspect his sexual
orientation is a hoax. The results are explosive and sickening.
</P>
<P>
   Peirce tells the story with quiet understanding and empathy,
avoiding the misstep of making Brandon a martyr, even if he is
destined for martyrdom in the name of intolerance, small-mindedness
and hate.
</P>
<P>
   Peirce has style. She uses visual motifs, such as time-exposure
tricks and persistent shots of open rural highways speeding past,
to conjure the idea of escape. Her voluptuous evocation of place _
the dusty farm roads, T-shirts and flannel, large American cars _
is on par with Gus Van Sant's knack for rural tableaux.
</P>
<P>
   If there's a complaint it's that the movie offers no narrative
surprises you wouldn't anticipate given the well-publicized case
facts. Its power is built-in. The facts alone will leave you
shaken.

 &HT;    `Liberty' glosses over travails of Jewish life
 &HT;    By Jeff Salamon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If there was resistance to the 1954 integration
of the Baltimore public schools _ and there was _ Barry Levinson's
``Liberty Heights,'' which opened Wednesday at the Arbor, doesn't
have the heart to show it to us. Levinson is so eager to please,
his camera would avert its gaze if a pigtail got dunked in an
inkwell that year.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe Levinson was too busy juggling his other
storylines to pay attention to such details. ``Liberty Heights,''
the fourth film in his ``Baltimore Quartet'' (``Diner,'' ``Tin
Men'' and ``Avalon'' came before) boasts a busy, tripartite
structure, centered on the Kurtzmans, a middle-class Jewish family.
Van Kurtzman (Adrien Brody), law student, pines for a blonde shiksa
goddess he meets at a Halloween party. His brother Ben (Ben
Foster), high school senior, pines for the black girl who sits near
him in homeroom. Their dad, Nate (Joe Mantegna), numbers runner and
burlesque theater owner, pines for a legit line of work.
</P>
<P>
   Levinson tries to lend these strivers depth by hitching an irony
to every subplot. The WASP elite Van is trying to infiltrate turns
out to be full of drunks with sexual hangups; Sylvia (Rebekah
Johnson), the black girl Ben falls for, is the daughter of a
well-to-do surgeon; Nate, who surrounds himself with henchmen and
flunkies, has a sense of fair play incompatible with the gangster
life.
</P>
<P>
   None of these wan turnabouts, however, compensates for the hole
at the center of ``Liberty Heights'': the sentimentalized portrait
of mid-century Jewish culture. Levinson etches a trio of Jews
looking for vitality, soul and success outside the confines of
their tribe, without hinting that American Jews were, at that very
moment, on the verge of a cultural takeover. Philip Roth, Lenny
Bruce and Allen Ginsberg, among others, were about to radically
transform the American popscape. But Levinson is so busy
sentimentalizing his childhood he can't see Judaism as anything but
a source of rectitude and accommodation.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Levinson sentimentalizes everything. The preppies
who beat up Van's friend Yussel for being Jewish turn out to be
alrightniks after all. Scribbles, the small-time pimp Nate is in
hock to, is never allowed to work up a sense of menace, which
simply deflates the kidnapping subplot at the film's climax.
</P>
<P>
   When Boogie, in ``Diner,'' got in trouble with a loan shark, his
panic was palpable. Here, Levinson is too concerned with warming
the heart to let that happen. That's what you get, I suppose, from
making too many movies with Robin Williams. (How many movies with
Robin Williams is too many? If the movie in question is ``Toys,''
the answer is one.)
</P>
<P>
   There are a few amusing scenes here and there, especially those
between Foster and Johnson (who is simply beguiling), but they only
point up how slack the rest of the script is. When he has nothing
else to do, Levinson tries to recreate the sort of mesmerizing
chatter Paul Reiser, Steve Guttenberg and Daniel Stern passed back
and forth in ``Diner.'' But now that Quentin Tarantino has elevated
this shtick into a full-blown aesthetic, Levinson's lost the spark.
These days, Paul Reiser gets handed better material when he's
shilling for AT&AMP;T.

   &UR; GAME OF THE WEEK &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville (13-1) vs. Tennessee (11-3)
</P>
<P>
   The lone blemish on Jacksonville's record is a 20-19 loss at
home to Tennessee in September. In the rain-swept game, the Titans
ensured the victory when Samari Rolle intercepted Mark Brunell in
the final seconds. The result was friction between Jaguars Coach
Tom Coughlin _ ``It was a bad pass,'' he said of the play _ and
Brunell, who replied, ``I only run the plays that are called.'' The
Jaguars are a happy bunch now, especially with 11 consecutive
victories and with the league's best record. Watch Jevon Kearse,
the Pro Bowl rookie defensive end, chase Brunell, two fleet players
who should dance in a cat-and-mouse tango all day long. Fred
Taylor's running is the key. If Tennessee contains Taylor _ and it
will _ The Titans gain the winning edge.
</P>
<P>
   Titans, 21-17.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FRIDAY NIGHT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Dallas (7-7) vs. New Orleans (2-12)
</P>
<P>
   It has been a frustrating season for Dallas, one of lost
opportunities mixed with infrequent gains. But Dallas remains alive
for a playoff berth, and this is a game it should not lose in any
fashion _ offense, defense or special teams. The Saints are reeling
and cannot wait for the season to end so they can get rid of Coach
Mike Ditka and more than a few malcontent players who have ruined
the atmosphere and any chance of success. Look for Dallas to
compile a bushel of big plays in both the passing and return games.
This Dallas victory sets up a heated clash next week in a season
finale between Dallas and the Giants in Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys, 31-16.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHRISTMAS DAY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Denver (5-9) vs. Detroit (8-6)
</P>
<P>
   These teams have not met since 1990. Thus, they know little
about each other but familiarity will come quickly. For Denver, the
season was lost from the start with quarterback controversy and
critical injuries. Detroit's season looked like a wash from its
first kickoff, but the Lions surprised and roared to a quick start
before melting in recent weeks. Charlie Batch (thumb injury)
returns at quarterback for Detroit in hopes of jolting the team's
sputtering playoff drive. Batch gives the Lions something extra in
mobility, decision-making and spirit. Detroit owns a +8 turnover
differential, much better than Denver's turnover-laden team, and
this is how the game is won early and late.
</P>
<P>
   Lions, 24-17.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUNDAY 1 P.M. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Arizona (6-8) vs. Atlanta (3-11)
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons blew up long ago, suffering through injuries and
giving the ball away at an alarming rate, nothing like their Super
Bowl team from a year ago. Now that they have hit rock bottom, it
is time to show a little life. And it is easier to do against a
team that last week in its 31-21 loss to Buffalo ruined its slim
playoff chances and now falls flat in despair. Watch Falcons
receivers Terance Mathis and Tim Dwight against Pro-Bowl cornerback
Aeneas Williams. Despite the records, that is a top-flight matchup
that will be full of tricky strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons, 16-14.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo (9-5) vs. New England (7-7)
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo is bubbly about its playoff chances, New England is
sour. What happened to the Patriots? They have collapsed,
especially on offense, and this game will be a reminder of why. The
New England fans will be booing from start to finish, and after the
game, the Patriot players will have to prevent their emotions from
spilling into an locker-room ugly scene. New England is in need of
a makeover, one that will happen likely sooner rather than later.
Buffalo, however, moves one step closer to the post-season. Doug
Flutie has passed for touchdowns in 12 straight games. With 41
yards, he will earn his first 3,000-yard passing season in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Bills, 23-20.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina (7-7) vs. Pittsburgh (5-9)
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh is another team that will likely change its
leadership and lineup dramatically after this season. It will not
make the playoffs this year, but Carolina still can with plenty of
help from other teams. First, the Panthers must win their final two
games. They cannot because they slip here. Pittsburgh is primed for
a turnaround game. It is a team that has more pride than it has
shown of late, especially last week in getting trounced at Kansas
City, 35-19. The Steelers have committed a league-low four fumbles.
They are plus 2 in turnover differential. Their pass defense ranks
third in the AFC. They should be better than 5-9, but inconsistent
play at quarterback has crushed their chances. For a game,
quarterback Mike Tomczak gets it right.
</P>
<P>
   Steelers, 31-20.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Chicago (6-8) vs. Rams (12-2)
</P>
<P>
   Bears' receiver Marcus Robinson did not make the Pro Bowl this
year but he should have. He is a big, tall, athletic receiver who
exhibits no fear. He leads the NFC in receiving yards and has
caught 71 balls, 9 for touchdowns. With another 79 receiving yards
he will own the Bears' career single-season record. He has a new
quarterback, the rookie Cade McNown, throwing him passes for an
entire game now, and this duo looks promising. The pair, however,
are no match for the Rams' quarterback, Kurt Warner, and his
quartet of dynamic receivers led by Isaac Bruce. Warner has tossed
36 touchdown passes, tops in the league, and Bruce has caught 11 of
them. The Rams also won the league's best rushing defense, allowing
an average of only 76.4 yards per game. The Bears are overmatched.
</P>
<P>
   Rams, 28-10.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati (4-10) vs. Baltimore (7-7)
</P>
<P>
   Too bad the Bengals and Ravens waited too late to begin
exploding on offense and winning games. The Ravens still own a
slight chance of making the playoffs, but more likely, it is
wait-till-next-year again for the Ravens. This victory gives them
more hope for a playoff-caliber team next year. For the Bengals,
Corey Dillon is a fluid and fun back to watch. The Ravens can earn
their first-ever 4-game winning streak and will behind quarterback
Tony Banks. These are his numbers in his last five games: 1,386
passing yards and 14 passing touchdowns. This is a shootout that
fits Baltimore best.
</P>
<P>
   Ravens, 38-33.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis (12-2) vs. Cleveland (2-13)
</P>
<P>
   The Colts can match a club record with their 11th straight
victory. They can also match their club record with their 13th
victory of the season. They can win their sixth straight road game.
The Browns can look across the field and see a team they can
emulate. They can hope for a turnaround next year like the Colts,
who last year were a 3-13 team. Indianapolis has plenty to play
for, including a shot at gaining home-field advantage throughout
the AFC playoffs. Once again, they will be led by Peyton Manning,
who has thrown at least one touchdown pass in 27 consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   Colts, 30-16.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota (8-6) vs. Giants (7-7)
</P>
<P>
   Both teams enter with high playoff hopes, the Vikings off a
victory (24-20 at home against Green Bay), the Giants off a loss
(31-10 at the Rams). The Vikings' victory was emotional, but so was
the Giants' loss. The Giants entered cocky and confident against
the Rams and left completely deflated. But the Giants are a team
that rebounds with vigor, and now their season is a two-game
season. Two victories and they are playoff bound. What a breakout
year for Giants receiver Amani Toomer (68 catches, 1,049 yards,
15.4 average yards gained per catch and 6 touchdowns). Last week
against the Rams, Toomer caught 9 passes and could have caught 9
more; he was that open. He will be again against the Vikings, but a
healthy dose of the rookie running back Joe Montgomery topples the
Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   Giants, 21-19.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUNDAY, 4 P.M. GAMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City (9-5) vs. Seattle (8-6)
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs have won four in a row and are sizzling, while
Seattle, which once owned a dominating lead in the AFC West, have
sunk. This game will likely decide the division, and the Chiefs
look prepared _ even on the road, even in the noisy Kingdome.
Chiefs tight end Tony Gonzalez, who earned his first Pro Bowl berth
this week, is finishing the season with flair _ he has six
touchdown catches in his last four games. Defenders are marvelling
over his body control in his pass routes, his soft hands and his
determination. Few tight ends affect the game the way Gonzalez can.
This game will be extremely hard-fought, but Kansas City wins it in
the end on a Pete Stoyanovich field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs, 19-16.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Oakland (7-7) vs. San Diego (6-8)
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders are the league's best rushing team, and the Chargers
allow the AFC's fewest rushing yards per carry. Brick meets brick.
Few teams want to see the Raiders make the playoffs. They are
dangerous because of their running game, led by a robust offensive
line and backs Tyrone Wheatley and Napolean Kauffman. Oakland's
45-0 mauling of Tampa Bay, the NFC Central Division leader, last
week was another reminder of how special the Raiders can be. They
are point here and there from being a 12-4 team. After this game,
they are an 8-7 team still hoping for a miracle playoff finish.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders, 17-13.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay (7-7) vs. Tampa Bay (9-5)
</P>
<P>
   Last week Tampa Bay could have clinched a playoff spot with a
victory. Instead, they collapsed against the Raiders. This week
Tampa Bay can clinch a playoff spot. Green Bay, however, will not
allow it. The Packers are underachievers and have struggled through
an inconsistent year. But this is a team that will rise in this
moment. It is Packers' quarterback Brett Favre vs. the Buccaneers'
rookie quarterback, Shaun King. Favre will simply not allow his
team to lose this game and kill its playoff chances.
</P>
<P>
   Packers, 16-14.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUNDAY NIGHT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Washington (8-6) vs. San Francisco (4-10)
</P>
<P>
   Playing the 49ers in December used to mean meeting a team
playing its prime football in an awfully tough place. Now the 49ers
are a shell of that that team, powerless against good teams and
pitiful against elite teams. Washington is a good team. There are
reasons to believe the 49ers will put up a fight _ pride, unbeaten
record against Washington Coach Norv Turner, the strong pass rush
of tackle Bryant Young. However, go with the Redskins. The
Washington offense is so much better than the 49ers' offense that
the game is won when Washington has the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Redskins, 30-24.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MONDAY NIGHT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Jets (6-8) vs. Miami (9-5)
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have beaten Miami in three straight games. The Jets are
plus 11 in turnover differential, and Miami stands at 0. Bill
Parcells is 7-7 vs. the Dolphins; Jimmy Johnson is 5-4 vs. the
Jets. But the Jets cannot make the playoffs, and Miami still can.
That's the difference. Under the national glare, Miami will regroup
and focus on a playoff sprint that includes winning this game. Look
for a big game from Dolphins' receiver Tony Martin, who with 65
receiving yards gains 1,000 for the season and becomes the second
player in league history to gain 1,000 with three different teams
(Irving Fryar is the other). Miami's Pro Bowl kicker, Olindo Mare,
needs one field goal for his 38th of the season, which would be a
league record.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins, 24-17.

 &HT;    High-tech BellSouth team eases CARE's Y2K worries
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sometimes it is the ``high-touch'' people who need
help from high-tech.
</P>
<P>
   And, recently, with the millennium just months away, one of the
world's premier humanitarian organizations (CARE, based in downtown
Atlanta offices) went to the region's largest telecommunications
company in an effort to head off any potential Y2K computer
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Without the help from BellSouth Corp., CARE would have spent
about $1.5 million to make sure its technology didn't get in the
way of its mission _ if it could have even been done without
outside assistance, said Pavan Rai, the organization's chief
information officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the high-tech guys helping high-touch people. They
have done just an outstanding job.''
</P>
<P>
   From the summer until this week, CARE relied on a BellSouth team
led by Robert Schwartz to get it ready. The group did an inventory
of CARE's processes, identifying all the places where a Y2K bug
might hide. A list was made of all software and hardware.
Contingency plans were written _ just in case things went wrong.
And then BellSouth helped set up a ``war room'' for CARE to monitor
its offices around the world during the first few days of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   CARE, which has a budget of $400 million and about 10,000
workers, last year provided emergency assistance to more than 6.5
million people in 28 countries. While most of that aid was
fundamental _ food or clothing _ the delivery systems often include
devices that are vulnerable to the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there are ships and cranes that rely on computers.
If they can't be operated properly, food cannot be smoothly
unloaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have Y2K compliance around the world if we are
going to continue helping the poorest of the poor,'' Rai said.
</P>
<P>
   CARE also uses computers to keep track of its work. Computer
databases update warehouse contents and shipments. Other databases
manage the financing that pays for the work. Thousands of workers
depend on communications systems _ wireless and otherwise _ to make
the work happen.
</P>
<P>
   Duane Ackerman, BellSouth's chairman and chief executive, said
he was glad that BellSouth was approached. ``By working closely
with CARE, we're able to give locally while affecting millions
globally. There is no better investment.''

TALBOTT SAYS RUSSIA'S CHECHNYA CAMPAIGN VIOLATES `INTERNATIONAL
NORMS' 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott ended two days
of talks on a sour note here Thursday, accusing Russia of
``indiscriminate killing'' in Chechnya and leaving without breaking
a lingering stalemate between Washington and Moscow over a major
arms control treaty.
</P>
<P>
   As Russian forces continue to pound rebel positions in the
breakaway republic of Chechnya, Talbott offered some of the
harshest U.S. criticism to date of the Kremlin's military campaign,
which proved enormously popular in the parliamentary elections last
week. He said Russia was violating ``international norms'' in
Chechnya by treating civilians in Chechnya as ``terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when Russian-U.S. relations are strained by Chechnya
and lingering disagreements over a series of other issues. Talbott
wound up his meetings with top officials in Moscow by saying that
``substantial differences, even disagreements'' remain over
Washington's proposal to modify the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty over Russia's vigorous objections.
</P>
<P>
   Washington wants to amend the treaty to allow both nations to
field defense systems to protect against limited long-range missile
attacks. The United States says this would help the two countries
protect against nuclear terrorism, but Russia asserts that changing
the treaty could set off a new arms race.
</P>
<P>
   As Talbott left, the Russian Foreign Ministry said that Moscow
``confirms its fundamental position of not accepting any attempts
to undermine this agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on Russian-U.S. disputes, Talbott said: ``We have
been through a tough year. But the stakes are high, and the common
interests are definitely there.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. envoy had come to Moscow at a time of renewed optimism
on arms control. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, buoyed by the
strong showing by his supporters in parliamentary elections last
Sunday, had said he would push for a long-delayed vote on
ratification of START II, the arms control treaty signed in 1993
that calls on both countries to reduce their nuclear warheads to
3,500 by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   But as Talbott left Moscow, the Russian defense minister, Gen.
Igor Sergeyev, offered a gloomy view to reporters in Belgrade,
Yugoslavia, saying that Russia's relations with NATO are sinking to
a new low.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our relations with the alliance have apparently entered a new
phase of getting colder,'' Sergeyev told the Russian news agency,
Interfax. ``The alliance is trying to talk to Russia about the
problem of Chechnya from a position of force.''
</P>
<P>
   Talbott expressed support for Russia's goals in eliminating
``extremism and terrorism'' in Chechnya, but said its methods
should correspond to international law. ``The feeling is that this
standard has not been met,'' he told reporters after a meeting with
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly there are many people in Chechnya who don't want to
see their territory used as a base for operations against Russia,''
said Talbott. ``But they also don't want to see themselves treated
as terrorists and enemies, not to mention victims of indiscriminate
killing and driving people from their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   The international rights group Human Rights Watch has reported
that at least 17 people were killed earlier this month in the
village of Alkhan-Yurt, in eastern Chechnya, when Russian soldiers
went on a rampage of looting and killing after clearing the village
of rebel guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As Russia moves into what one general said were the final weeks
of its Chechen offensive, Chechnya's top Muslim leader, Mufti
Akhmed Kadyrov, who has broken with the Chechen leadership, said
Thursday that he would be ready to act as a go-between in talks
between Moscow and Chechen leaders.
</P>
<P>
   After an hourlong meeting with Alexander Voloshin, a top Kremlin
aide to President Boris Yeltsin, Mufti Kadyrov said Moscow should
define its goals in Chechnya, and open up talks with Chechnya's
reigning warlords, but not with the Chechen president, Aslan
Maskhadov. The mufti, who backed Chechnya's war of independence
against Russia in 1994 to 1996, broke with Maskhadov last fall when
the Chechen president failed to speak out against armed raids
against the neighboring region of Dagestan, led by Chechen field
commander Shamil Basayev.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support talks to halt the war,'' Mufti Kadyrov told a press
conference. ``No matter with whom.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A day after Putin said that almost all of Chechnya is already
under Russian control, Russian military spokesmen said federal
forces were fighting guerrillas on several fronts _ near Chechnya's
western border with Dagestan, another Russian region, and in its
southern mountains, where 350 rebels were reportedly trying to
break out of the village of Sezhen-Yurt.
</P>
<P>
   Russian television Thursday night reported that federal troops
were closing in on the Chechen capital of Grozny where thousands of
civilians _ between 8,000 and 35,000, according to various reports
_ remain trapped, hiding in their cellars, afraid to move because
of continued bombardment of the city.
</P>
<P>
   A top Russian commander, Col. Gen. Viktor Kazantsev, said that
Grozny would be taken by special operations, not by storm. In an
interview published in Krasnaya Zvesda, the armed forces newspaper,
he also said that Russian troops would be in full control of the
entire region, including its mountainous south, within three weeks
``at the most.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Russian troops have already made forays into the city, described
by military spokesman as reconnaissance operations. During one
foray last week, journalists in Grozny reported that dozens of
Russian soldiers _ as many as 100 according to one account _ were
killed. Those reports have been vigorously denied by Russian
military spokesmen.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to charges about the killings of civilians in
Alkhan-Yurt, the Defense Ministry, in a statement Thursday said
Russian troops had used adequate force in taking the village on
Nov. 29. According to the statement, federal troops, assured by
local leaders that guerrillas had left the area, moved into the
village only to find themselves under attack. Thirty federal
soldiers were wounded, and 10 military vehicles, including a tank,
were destroyed in the fierce fighting that followed, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers for Human Rights Watch, who interviewed survivors
from the village, have said that the killings took place after the
village was secured by federal troops, as soldiers went on a door
to door rampage, loading up their vehicles with stolen goods and
killing residents who protested.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Prime Minister Nikola Koshman, Moscow's main envoy to
Chechnya, said Thursday night that an investigation into the
incident by a military special prosecutor is still underway.

 &HT;    Online stores see boom during holidays
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was the best of times and the worst of times for
online retailers this holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   According to Web measurement firm Media Metrix, the number of
online shoppers ordering gifts this year increased 33 percent from
last year during the last week before Christmas. But an equal
number were nervously following the delivery process with repeated
visits to the Web sites for UPS and Federal Express.
</P>
<P>
   In the final days before Christmas, traffic to e-commerce sites
decreased by 6 percent. Media Metrix said the decline was due to
the shrinking number of days left to order gifts in time for the
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   However, part of the slowdown could be due to the e-commerce
backlash, as some popular e-commerce sites including Toysrus.com
and others announced they could not fulfill the orders they
received.
</P>
<P>
   Toysrus.com began e-mailing shoppers late Tuesday that their
purchases would not arrive but said they would be compensated for
the inconvenience with $100 coupons that can be used in its stores.
</P>
<P>
   Customer concerns may also have led to an increase in the number
of visits to both UPS.com and FedEx.com. Customers looking to see
whether packages had been dispatched and/or delivered increased
visits to the two sites by 57 percent and 94 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   In the final days of the holiday shopping season, the
flowers/gifts/greetings category was up by 10 percent as shoppers
looked for last-minute gifts. An advertising campaign by Web site
ProFlowers.com said that customers could order as late as Thursday
and be assured of Christmas delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers also spent more time shopping online, according to
the measurement service. Visitors aged 12-17 were up 89 percent
over last year.
</P>
<P>
   This could be due in part to the many efforts this year to bring
teen shoppers online, including wish lists, gift registries and
sites targeted at teens, such as RocketCash, Delias and FastFrog.
Teen-agers now make up 5 percent of total online shoppers, up from
3 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, led by Time magazine Person of the year Jeff Bezos,
was the top e-commerce site for the week ending Dec. 19.
</P>
<P>
   The online retailer had 6,967 unique visitors to the site _ up a
whopping 94 percent from the same time last year. EBay, eToys,
Barnesandnoble.com, Toysrus.com, CDNow, Buy.com, Egreetings,
Expedia travel services and Egghead software and electronics sites
rounded out Media Metrix's list of the top e-commerce sites for the
week.
</P>

   MAYVILLE, South Africa _ The lacy curtains from the secondhand
shop flutter over the bedroom window. The white tiles salvaged from
the garbage dump gleam on the kitchen floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The white people, they threw this away, too!'' exclaimed
Patrick Mbatha, 38, chuckling over his good-as-new wicker sofa and
the inexplicable ways of wealthy white people. ``You can see the
quality! It's a good cane. I saw it and right away I put it in the
boot of my car.''
</P>
<P>
   Mbatha is a hard-driving taxicab driver, a doting father of four
and a proud new member of this country's swelling class of
homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   He is a leader of his block association, which meets under a
shady tree on Sundays, and he reminds his neighbors to keep their
grass cropped and their garbage bagged. He grimaces over
electricity bills, counts pennies for school uniforms and grows
corn in his garden for lean times.
</P>
<P>
   And on slow days, when his cab stalls or customers lag, he
marvels at his family's journey from a mud shack into this
fledgling suburb of frilly curtains, vegetable gardens and
strivers' dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last five years, the South African government has put 3
million poor people in brick houses for the very first time,
spending $6 billion to shelter a population bigger than Chicago's.
</P>
<P>
   The modest one-room houses are the most tangible symbol of the
post-apartheid government's commitment to redressing this country's
stark inequalities. And the changing lives within the brick walls
offer an intimate view of the hopes and hardships of ordinary black
people still struggling to climb the economic and social ladder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never dreamed it could happen,'' said Mbatha, proudly
displaying his tiny house, his flush toilet, his two-room extension
and the mailbox that he built when postal delivery started in
September.
</P>
<P>
   He stood quietly when a visitor asked how three years of home
ownership had changed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a man,'' he said finally. ``I'm proud. We may not
always have enough food. But here no rain will get you.''
</P>
<P>
   If the houses impart a new sense of dignity, it is also true
that Mbatha's sturdy roof cannot shield his family from the
problems that continue to bedevil this new democracy.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa still has one of the highest crime rates in the
world. Unemployment stands at nearly 40 percent, by some estimates.
And these social ills infect nearly every house on Mbatha's narrow
street, which is still so new that it has no name.
</P>
<P>
   Mandla Ngwane, 50, a father of three, is jobless. Bongiwe
Mkhize, 30, a single mother, worries about the increasing number of
rapes of young girls.
</P>
<P>
   Mbatha's wife, Anna, who was laid off as a clerk in a clothing
store in 1997, worries about feeding her family. Sometimes the
family runs so low on cash that the electricity is cut off, and
they spend a night or two in darkness, Mrs. Mbatha said. Other
times, the secondhand refrigerator goes empty, and the children go
to sleep hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mbatha loves her house and her new life in it. It is the
first time, she confides, that she has ever really enjoyed daily
chores. After all, it is much nicer to mop a tile floor than to
sweep a dirt one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like a white lady now,'' she laughed. ``Madam of my own
house.''
</P>
<P>
   But at night, when the guns sing in the nearby squatter camp,
she and her husband lie in bed wide-eyed and frightened.
``Sometimes,'' Mrs. Mbatha said, ``I think about moving.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows whether the new communities will sustain themselves
as sought-after first stops on the road into the tiny black middle
class or whether they will deteriorate into crime-ridden slums that
lead nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   In some places, shoddy developers have already left people stuck
with crumbling houses that are quickly declining in value. In other
areas, homeowners cannot pay for basic services like water and
electricity, forcing city councils to abandon plans to improve or
maintain the neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury is still out on whether we've created new vibrant
suburbs or new ghettos on the peripheries of our cities,'' said
David Porteous, an expert on low-income housing and the managing
director of Gateway Home Loans, a lending agency that works with
the government to provide loans for poor homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, the demand for houses in Mayville, 15 minutes
outside Durban on the eastern coast, is enormous, despite its
problems. Nationwide, three million people are on a waiting list
for housing.

 MAYVILLE , South Africa : for housing. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It only takes a look down the hill, a glimpse at the teeming
squatter camp that her family left behind, for Mrs. Mbatha to
remember how lucky she is. So she builds a fence to deter potential
robbers and plants corn while her neighbors make their own
adjustments to suburban life.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mkhize had to become used to the quiet. In the squatter
camp where she grew up, music blared, drunks wailed and chatty
neighbors passed easily from shack to shack. Here, neighbors lock
their doors and radios fall silent at night.
</P>
<P>
   Ngwane had to figure out how to expand his house without any
cash, a problem that he solved by slapping together an illegal
shack in the backyard, much to the dismay of the block association.
</P>
<P>
   And the local drug dealer had to adjust to angry neighbors who
threatened to have him evicted if he continued to use his house as
the headquarters for his bustling marijuana business. He now hawks
his wares in town, the neighbors said.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Mbatha grumbled about some neighbors, the one who drinks
too much and the one who lets the grass grow two feet high. But he
said he loves his new life.
</P>
<P>
   While his wife reminds the children to turn off the lights to
keep the bills low, Mbatha dreams about expanding even further,
about building a living room and a sitting room with views of the
tall skyscrapers that glitter on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are back in the land of our fathers,'' said Mbatha, whose
relatives lived on this land for generations until 1960, when the
white government forced them to move to make room for Indian
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``This family will never leave this place again.''
</P>
<P>
   But his 10-year-old daughter, Sindy, wrinkles her nose at his
plans. She attends a multiracial school, speaks English with an
ease that astonishes her Zulu-speaking parents and dreams of buying
a big house with a Jacuzzi where the white people live.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to live in town,'' Sindy said. ``Not here.''
</P>
<P>
   Mbatha laughs at his pretty, precocious daughter. But in truth,
he fears that none of his children will choose to live in this
community as adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they don't belong to this society,'' he said sadly.
``They interact with children from better areas. Their eyes, they
start to see. They tell us, `My friends live in better places.'
They will not stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he has considered moving to the white suburbs that
his daughter dreams about, Mbatha said, ``I don't even want to
dream about something I cannot achieve.'' And he slumped for a
moment, ashamed.
</P>
<P>
   But then his wife called his name, and he was the proud
homeowner again, bustling about the house, pointing out the newly
laid foundation for the living room and the battered phone that he
had just bought at a secondhand shop.
</P>
<P>
   There are no telephones lines in Mayville yet, and the Mbatha
family has no money to pay an extra bill. But the phone sits on a
shelf of honor in the wood china cabinet, a silent symbol of one
man's faith in a better future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The telephone lines will come,'' Mbatha said. ``And when they
come, we will be ready.''

TRAFFIC FLOWS SMOOTHLY ALONG BORDER DESPITE SECURITY ALERT 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROWNSVILLE, Texas _ Heightened security along the Mexican
border has not slowed international traffic at the many bridges and
ports of entry into the United States, according to officials and
travelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took about 20 minutes, which is normal,'' said Sylvia
Silva, a Matamoros resident who drove across the Gateway
International Bridge to Brownsville early Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Other residents reported a 40- to 45-minute wait to cross any of
the three international bridges at Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell they are checking more, and asking more
questions,'' Silva said. ``They didn't ask us, but you can tell
they were asking other people.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States increased security personnel at U.S. airports,
ports and border crossings this week to keep an eye out for
terrorists in response to the Dec. 14 arrest of suspected terrorist
Ahmed Ressam in Washington state. Authorities said Ressam, 32, was
smuggling explosives into the United States from Canada and has
ties to an Islamic fundamentalist group.
</P>
<P>
   At the Gateway bridge in Brownsville, passenger cars, buses and
trucks crept across the two northbound lanes and were routed to
four inspection booths. U.S. Customs officers and immigration
inspectors at the booths seemed to check most vehicles in a few
minutes, and only a few of the cars were sent to more intensive
secondary inspections or pulled over for looks under their hoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had any problems so far,'' said Maria Reba,
director of field operations for the U.S. Customs Service in South
Texas. ``You should expect the same long lines you have every
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1,500 inspectors in the district from Brownsville to Del
Rio, and at the Austin and San Antonio airports, are working
overtime in an effort to avoid lengthening the traditionally long
lines caused by holiday traffic, Reba said. A number of inspectors
normally assigned to administrative duties have been pulled from
their desks and sent to border crossings, she said. But no
additional personnel from outside the district has been needed.
</P>
<P>
   Since the heightened security measures were implemented, nothing
suspicious had occurred in Reba's district or anywhere along the
southern border, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is not disturb that too much,'' Reba
said of normal Christmas congestion. ``We're doing additional work.
We're doing more examinations, talking to more people, talking
longer and spending a little more time to be satisfied there is
nothing out of the ordinary.''

 &HT;    Indexes set records as Santa rallies on Wall Street
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Santa Claus paid an early visit to the stock market
Thursday. The Nasdaq composite topped 4,000 for the first time and
the Nasdaq, Dow Jones industrial average and Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
closed at record levels.
</P>
<P>
   It was a classic case of the so-called Santa Claus rally,
according to analysts, as seasonal trading pushed stocks higher
despite a holiday-related drop in volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a seasonal upside bias at this time of the year based
on money flows accelerating and liquidity becoming thinner as some
institutions close their books for the year,'' said Prudential
Securities strategist Larry Wachtel.
</P>
<P>
   Volume diminishes as traders and investors leave their desks
before the Christmas holiday weekend, which means the market rises
on weaker than usual demand.
</P>
<P>
   New York Stock Exchange volume totaled 726.9 million shares,
down from 844.2 million Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On average, U.S. stock markets have gained on seven of the 10
trading sessions before the Christmas holidays since 1989, said
Wachtel.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq, continuing its torrid climb on the strength of
strong demand for technology stocks, briefly moved above 4,000
shortly after noon, when it peaked at 4,001.63. Although it pulled
back, it still rose almost 1 percent for the day, to a new high of
3,969.53.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq closed above 3,000 for the first time Nov. 3 en route
to a year-to-date gain of 81 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow rose 1.8 percent to a record 11,405.76, the first since
Aug. 25. The S&AMP;P-500 gained 1.6 percent to 1,458.34, also a record.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks rose to within 9 points
of its all-time high of 491.41, reached April 21, 1998. Analysts
said the index's rise reflected the wider breadth of market demand
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the market was also buoyed by fresh evidence that
the U.S. economy is still growing at a moderate rate. The Commerce
Department said personal income, which includes wages, interest and
government benefits, rose 0.4 percent in November. It was the
smallest increase since August, although the gain was twice what
analysts had anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   The government also said orders to U.S. factories for big-ticket
manufactured goods rose 1.2 percent in November, the first gain
since August.
</P>
<P>
   That means manufacturing industries will continue to improve in
the coming year, but analysts said it also suggests inflation will
still be a potential threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The monthly economic numbers, many of which track the factory
sector, will remain strong and that will keep the heat on the bond
market and the (Federal Reserve),'' said First Union economist Mark
Vitner.
</P>
<P>
   After raising short-term rates three times earlier in the year,
the Fed declined to raise them again at its December meeting this
week _ the last of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes of the Fed's November meeting, released Thursday, show
policy-makers decided to bump up interest rates in November because
the century date change would make such a move less attractive in
December.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts continue to be wary about interest rates, knowing
of Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's commitment to keeping inflation
down even if it means putting the brakes on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   As for bonds, prices have continued to fall as concern about the
inflation outlook in that market grows.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in bond prices has had the effect of pushing 30-year
Treasury yields to their highest levels in more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   The yield is just shy of 6.5 percent, a level that analysts
regard as a threat to stocks by providing investors with an
attractive return offered by a relatively risk-free security.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rising bond yields, many analysts remain bullish on
January, when buying historically picks up as investors enter the
market with year-end bonuses, pension fund payouts and the
repurchase of stocks they sold for tax purposes late in the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starting Jan. 3, 2000, we see a good rally from normal
first-of-year buying,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, chief market
strategist for A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons. ``By year-end, we look for the
(30-year) bond to start trending down, to a yield of 5.7 percent by
spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman also said the market is likely to get a boost from
pent-up demand caused by the year 2000 concern threat.
</P>
<P>
   There's a widely held belief that investors unwilling to buy
stocks in December from fear of a computer glitch will rush back
into the market in January after the year 2000 threat has passed.

FELICIA KAPLAN; POLITICAL SATIRIST, WRITER OF LIGHT VERSE; AT 83 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Felicia Kaplan, who, writing under her maiden name,
Felicia Lamport, earned a reputation as one of America's best-known
writers of light verse and most distinctive political satirists,
died Thursday at her Cambridge home. She was 83. The cause of death
was pneumonia. She had been in increasingly frail health for many
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word for Felicia is `unquenchable,' '' New York Times
columnist Anthony Lewis said Thursday of Mrs. Kaplan, a friend of
many years' standing. ``I can't think of anyone who could have
survived what she did for so many years with such fire of wit and
love unquenched.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1981, the Globe's Focus section had run Mrs. Kaplan's
``Muse of the Week in Review,'' in which she deployed her intricate
wordplay to skewer the latest folly in Washington or on Beacon
Hill. Her work also appeared in The New Yorker, The New York Times,
The Atlantic Monthly, Harper's, McCall's, The New Republic,
Saturday Review, Look, and the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.
</P>
<P>
   As such an eclectic list of publications might suggest, Mrs.
Kaplan's work ranged far and wide. She was as comfortable parodying
T. S. Eliot, in ``The Love Song of R. Milhous Nixon, 1973'' (``Let
us go then, in my plane/For a weekend of repose in Key Biscayne'')
as she was sounding like a latter-day Edward Lear, in ``Lines on an
Aching Brow,'' which in its entirety reads, ``I hereby confess/That
of all I possess/I'd most gladly be minus/The sinus'').
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kaplan's verse was collected in four volumes: ``Scrap
Irony'' (1961), ``Cultural Slag'' (1966), ``Light Metres'' (1982),
and ``Political Plumlines'' (1984). Her first book was a novel, the
best-selling ``Mink on Weekdays'' (1950).
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kaplan was born and raised in New York, the daughter of
Samuel C. Lamport and Miriam (Dworsky) Lamport. The antic milieu in
which she was raised provided material she would later use in her
novel. She graduated from Vassar College in 1937 and went to work
as a writer for MGM.
</P>
<P>
   She married Benjamin Kaplan, a lawyer, in 1942. They moved to
Cambridge in 1947 when he joined the faculty of Harvard Law School.
At both their Bond Street home and on Martha's Vineyard, where the
Kaplans summered for many years, they entertained a lively and
eclectic mix of guests from the worlds of academe, law, politics,
and media.
</P>
<P>
   ``She suffered fools politely, but not gladly,'' Robert Manning,
the former editor of The Atlantic Monthly and a longtime friend,
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having Felicia as a friend protected you from enemies on all
sides: She was so loyal, in addition to being so entertaining and
ingenious.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kaplan taught expository writing at Harvard from 1980 to
1988 and then creative writing at the Harvard Extension School. She
was a past member of the board of the MacDowell Colony and the
American Chess Foundation. Chess was a great passion of Mrs.
Kaplan's, as were bridge and gardening. She was a member the
Author's Guild, and the National Writers Union.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her husband, she leaves a son, James L. of
Northampton; a daughter, Nancy Mansbach, of Newton; and four
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral services will be private. A memorial service will be
held at a later date.

 &HT;    Celebrating the New Year in Century
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CENTURY, Fla. _ They'll ring in the New Year here with minature
pony rides, a pie eating contest, ugliest man competition,
fireworks and horseshoes.
</P>
<P>
   Why not welcome the new year, organizer's figure, in a place
named for the last turn of the century?
</P>
<P>
   No one's quite seen anything like it in this former lumber town
of 2,500 people, which has been in an economic coma since the mill
shut down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt it would be more
</P>
<P>
   well-received this year given the name of the town,'' said
Century CPA Ann Brooks, who's helped organize the celebration.
</P>
<P>
   When Michigan businessman Russell Alger needed to expand his
timber empire in 1900, he purchased 250,000 acres of forest in a
black community of Northwest Florida called Teaspoon. The Escambia
River flowed past. A train station took the name of the community.
</P>
<P>
   In 1901, Alger _ a former Michigan governor and Secretary of War
under President McKinley until he resigned after being criticized
for the lack of military preparation prior to the Spanish-American
War _ rejected naming the remote Florida station after himself. But
he agreed to a later suggestion, brought on by the change in the
calendar: Century.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the town's historical society today brag they haven't
been able to find another town in the nation named Century.
</P>
<P>
   Remnants of the old Alger-Sullivan Lumber Company are scattered
throughout Century's historic district, where Spanish Moss cascades
down the branches of towering oak trees. Just a few generations
ago, moonshiners and honky-tonks pervaded the dense woods and
flatlands along the Escambia River.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whiskey was rampant and I was right in the middle of it,''
recalled Jerry Fischer, 60, a local photographer and city
councilman. In pockets of town, poverty lingers. Crack cocaine
dealing has replaced bootlegging.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an economic boom throughout the South, Century's
unemployment rate soars near 20 percent. Many residents are on
welfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the lumber company left town, they left behind a whole
lot of people who depended on them for everything,'' said Century
Mayor Benny Barnes. ``When they left, they took a whole lot of the
leaders with them.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1957, Alger-Sullivan sold its timberlands to a group of paper
companies. In 1967, Jim Walters Corp. added a door manufacturing
factory to the plant and slowly phased out the sawmill.
</P>
<P>
   There's been some resurgence. A state prison built about 10
years ago has provided jobs. A nearby industrial park has attracted
medical companies. The city offers financial incentives to
businesses that locate here. In the 1970s, the Florida town of
South Flomaton annexed the community of Century then changed its
name to Century. U.S. 29, which cuts through town and is a familiar
route to Atlantans who travel south to Pensacola, is four-laned.
CVS has replaced the Big B. Still, the Piggly Wiggly remains the
only grocery store in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just not lots here,'' said Daniel Moore, Piggly Wiggly
manager. ``So you have to go other places if you want to get a job
and you're going to be a professional.'' Chicken crackled as Barnes
dropped freshly floured pieces in a black kettle of boiling oil
fired by a propane burner set up behind the police station. As he
does every year, the mayor cooked for the annual city hall
Christmas party.
</P>
<P>
   This much is certain: The town is Y2K complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than fret whether the town's 7-year-old computers would
survive New Year's Day, Century spent $20,000 on new ones. A
generator is hooked up to city hall to keep them running.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think the lights might go off,'' Barnes said.
There will be a generator hooked up to the lights at the city park
_ named for Century native and Arizona Diamondbacks manager Buck
Showalter _ Dec. 31, when the town's celebration begins. A crowd of
7,000 is expected.
</P>
<P>
   A 30-minute fireworks display will bring the New Year in with a
bang. The city kicked in $5,000 for the celebration and was matched
by the county. Billboards promote the event all along U.S. 29.
``There are people that would not be happy here,'' said resident
Margaret Collier, 73. ``We are not a sophisticated town. But if you
want good, hearty people, then they're here.''

DISASTER DEEPENS UNCERTAINTY ABOUT VENEZUELA'S FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By LARRY ROHTER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ A week of immense landslides and floods has
done more than destroy lives, homes and public works here. The
country's worst natural disaster of modern times has also left an
institutional vacuum and deepened uncertainty about how the
government and economy are to be run over the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   The torrential rains that brought on the calamity began on Dec.
15, the same day that Venezuelans overwhelmingly approved a new
Constitution that confers broad new powers on President Hugo Chavez
and his allies in the military. Chavez, a former Army colonel, was
elected to office a year ago this month.
</P>
<P>
   Although the new charter has already been promulgated, the
measures putting it into effect have not been taken, and they are
not likely to be under current conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In a hurried effort to fill the gap, the Constitutional
Assembly, dominated by followers of Chavez, formally dissolved
Congress late Wednesday, replacing it with an appointed 21-member
body drawn mostly from its own ranks. The assembly itself is to go
out of existence on Feb. 3, and the interim council, to be led by
former Interior Minister Luis Miquilena, will take over all
legislative functions until new elections can be held.
</P>
<P>
   Before the referendum on Dec. 15, Chavez had said that he wanted
elections for all public offices, including his own, to be held
``as soon as possible'' or early next year.
</P>
<P>
   But the disaster and the devastation that it has inflicted on
the economy and the schools, hospitals and other government
buildings that would be polling places have led to speculation that
elections may have to be postponed until later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   The decree on Wednesday also appointed a new Supreme Court and
dismissed Comptroller General Eduardo Roche Lander, an independent
who had been aggressively investigating what he describes as
corruption in the military and mishandling of public funds by the
Chavez government.
</P>
<P>
   A result is to give the president virtually unlimited authority,
leading newspapers here to predict that a dictatorial ``war
economy'' could soon be declared.
</P>
<P>
   Already there have been complaints that the military is seeking
to exclude any other group, including elected civilian officials,
from meaningful participation in relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people in the Armed Forces wanted to impose a single
authority,'' Pablo Medina, a pro-Chavez member of the Constituent
Assembly, complained in a speech on Wednesday in which he also
warned that during ``great tragedies, great fortunes are made, and
we must avoid that.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar objections have been made by police officers, some of
whom have found themselves barred from entering areas they usually
patrol, even though victims are clamoring for protection from
robbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The army is acting like they are the only ones in charge, and
there is no role for anyone else,'' said Inspector Jose Contreras
of the Caracas metropolitan police who is working in Blandin, the
neighborhood of the capital most damaged by the disaster.
</P>
<P>
   As for Chavez, the crisis appears to have intensified the
populace's feelings, both positive and negative, about him. Those
who admired him before blame previous administrations for creating
the conditions that led to the catastrophe and are even more
solidly behind him. Critics, who accuse him of mismanaging the
disaster, now have more reason than ever to dislike him.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since the disaster began, Chavez has been everywhere, wearing
camouflage fatigues and a red military beret as he personally
supervises relief efforts. He has also halted his attacks on what
he calls a ``rancid oligarchy'' of politicians, business executives
and church leaders, instead praising them for making supplies,
transportation and money available to victims of the floods.
</P>
<P>
   That display of good will has not been universally returned,
however. The archbishop of Caracas has said Chavez's arrogance
``attracted the wrath of God'' and brought down the floods. In the
heavily damaged coastal area of Los Corales, an angry painting on a
wall proclaims, ``Thanks to Chavez, the world has ended.''
</P>
<P>
   That statement would appear to be a reference to long and
sharply critical reports in two newspapers, El Nacional and El
Mundo, that accused the Chavez administration of ignoring weather
reports and warnings from community leaders that waters were rising
and that a disaster was on the way. Instead, the reports contend,
the government chose to focus its attention on the constitutional
referendum in an effort to assure a big turnout and a resounding
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Against that backdrop, former Planning Minister Teodoro Petkoff,
who became editor of El Mundo when Chavez came to power,
unexpectedly announced his resignation on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Petkoff complained that a ``cynical'' and ``unscrupulous''
government was exerting ``tremendous pressure'' and ``blackmail''
on the paper's owners to have him soften its reporting by falsely
claiming that the paper had not paid taxes that it owed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I can say it openly,'' Petkoff wrote in a farewell
statement, ``the government has been extorting the Capriles Lopez
family in order to force a change of policy at El Mundo.''
</P>
<P>
   Government spokesmen declined to comment on the case. But a
foreign political analyst here described El Mundo's disaster
coverage of recent days as ``the straw that broke the camel's
back.''

 &HT;    Southern health chief has children on her mind

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ann Rosewater, a chief adviser to U.S. Health and
Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, this month was appointed
regional director of HHS in the South. Her Atlanta office serves
Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina,
South Carolina and Tennessee. Rosewater has developed an expertise
on protection of children. She recently shared some of her opinions
on health and social issues with staff writer Marlon Manuel. Some
excerpts:
</P>

   Q: Sen. Mike DeWine, a Republican from Ohio considered an expert
on children's issues, has been quoted as saying that foster care
really isn't on the radar screen with a lot of folks in Congress.
As a former congressional aide, what do you think it's going to
take to make that topic an issue in the 2000 elections?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think, actually, issues around children are on the minds of
a lot of people, though not enough. Never enough. And issues about
the most vulnerable children are more challenging to get on
people's screens as an issue, if only because they're less visible
and there are fewer of them. .. This week the president signed a
new piece of legislation ... that will double the independent
living program, which is a foster care transition program for those
kids who are aging out and can help them get on their feet and not
fall back without work or becoming homeless. That's a very big and
exciting change and improvement in the foster care system.
</P>
<P>
   Q: With foster care, should emphasis be placed on family
preservation, on adoption or on some other mechanism to take care
of these children?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's a continuum of support that has to be provided. But
I'd like to step back and learn what's going on in this particular
region. . .. I know it's particularly on the minds of people in
this state, and I certainly would like to be helpful, and I think
there's a continuing role for the federal government in trying to
help states and communities help ensure safety for all children and
families. ... I'm excited there's going to be a new (Georgia
Department of Family and Children Services) director. I know some
steps have been taken and that's very positive, and we're looking
forward to working together and helping out.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Based on what you know about the region, do you have a
priority or goal as you step into this role?
</P>
<P>
   A: I certainly want to listen and learn from the people around
the eight states that are part of this region before I pick a
specific target for myself. ... The demographics of the region are
changing. There are more Latinos, and not just in Florida, but in
Georgia and North Carolina as you look at the Census projections.
One of the things I want is to help people get adjusted to this
diversity and change ... protecting people who may have a harder
time benefiting from the growth, make sure people get work and
opportunities, and of course, give kids a healthy and positive
opportunity to get started. One other thing, of course, is lots of
these changes, lots of these issues through the region have huge
implications for health and for health care. So HHS has huge
responsibilities, obviously, for making sure not only that people
have health insurance but that the quality of care that people get
_ whether it's a nursing home or at home or at whatever level _ is
good.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Picking up on some of that, for instance in Tennessee, Gov.
Sundquist and the General Assembly have been working very hard to
overhaul TennCare. How critical is that issue for that state?
</P>
<P>
   A: TennCare has been an important experiment, and we care deeply
about ensuring that people have continued health care and health
coverage. The state has the challenge to make sure that it can keep
all these folks insured with quality care. Of course, that's a
significant issue ... I have had the opportunity just recently to
meet the governor, and so I'm certainly available as they go
through this process, trying to figure out what they're going to
do. I know they have some serious challenges. It's really an
important state responsibility to figure out how to make TennCare
work.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You mention the growth of the region. Still, there are
pockets of the South that have not experienced the same kind of
boom. This summer, President Clinton went to some of the poorest
areas, Appalachia in Kentucky, the Mississippi Delta. How prevalent
is poverty still in pockets of the South and what type of a threat
is it for children in the region?
</P>
<P>
   A: One of the issues we're seeing _ and it's not only an issue
for the South but the nation _ is while there's economic growth,
some people are really benefiting but, as you're saying, others are
left behind, both in areas of the South and particular groups of
families and children. And that income gap is actually increasing.
What I think is critical is to figure out how we can take the kind
of responsibility as good partners with states and communities and
families, to make sure that people who might be vulnerable _ and I
think kids are in particularly vulnerable situations _ how we can
make sure we create pathways to opportunity. I think the sort of
impression of disparity, as opposed to the reality of disparity, to
the extent that's out there, is something we need to address.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You talked about ``pathways to opportunity.'' Do you have
specific ideas?
</P>
<P>
   A: Again, I'm hoping I'm going to learn a lot about what's going
on state by state. ... Three states in this region just received
what are called high-performance bonuses for some of the good work
they've done in getting people into jobs, helping them retain jobs,
helping them improve their earnings. We're eager to build on that
and get all the states up to speed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There's been a moratorium in place the last six years that
keeps HHS from auditing how states spend federal dollars that have
been earmarked for foster care. Do you foresee an end to that
moratorium, and while that moratorium is in effect, how can
taxpayers be sure their money is being spent on the purposes it was
intended?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was imposed by Congress because Congress perceived that
the basis on which monitoring was being done of states' compliance
was not very meaningful. What HHS has done, which I think has been
quite important and is reflected in a lot of pieces of legislation
that have been enacted regarding foster care and child welfare, is
that we have key goals for the resources that are shared with
states: Safety, permanency and well-being for children. These goals
need to be embedded in the monitoring that we do, and the
monitoring should be designed in a way that we can work with
states. We're not interested in playing ``gotcha,'' we're
interested in getting good service, good care and good movement
toward permanency for these kids. We've been in the process of
redesigning that approach to accountability, and I think we're
eager to get on with that.

DETAILS EMERGE OF MASSACRE OF CHECHEN VILLAGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV AND DMITRY SHALGANOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOZDOK, Russia _ Russia's commanders Thursday said the end of
its war against separatist militants in Chechnya was near, even as
grim details emerged of an alleged massacre by Russian troops and a
top US diplomat accused Moscow of treating civilians as terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   What that means for the fate of tens of thousands of civilians
trapped in rebel-held territory in the breakaway North Caucasus
republic remained unclear. Russia says it is restoring heat, light,
and order to the parts of the strife-torn region it has recaptured,
while Chechens fleeing the fighting speak of looting and summary
executions of defenseless civilians by drunken Russian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The worst reports so far have come from Alkhan-Yurt, a small
village on the southwest outskirts of the besieged capital, Grozny.
There, refugees and human rights groups say, Russian troops went on
a rampage and killed as many as 41 civilians after capturing the
town in heavy fighting earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Russia first denied that anything untoward had taken place, but
it has now opened an investigation. Military sources said the
commander of the troops involved, Major General Vladimir Shamanov,
had been reprimanded.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of the massacre were corroborated Thursday by leaders of
the loyalist Chechen regime handpicked by Moscow. Malik Saidulayev,
the head of the pro-Moscow Chechen State Council, said drunken
Russian soldiers of the 15th Battalion of the 58th Army had
massacred 23 village residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They found some stores of cognac and vodka. . . Soldiers
entered homes, and if they saw that a person was alone . . . they
would kill him,'' Saidulayev told a Moscow radio station.
Saidulayev, who said he had pictures and videos of the massacre,
said only some of the village's houses had been damaged in the
fighting for Alkhn-Yurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest were burned by the troops, who set them ablaze after
looting them,'' Saidulayev said.
</P>
<P>
   Saidulayev, who has spent the last three years in Moscow, is
originally from Alkhan-Yurt, but he is no darling of the
separatists. When he was appointed in September, rebel sympathizers
in Alkhan-Yurt reportedly blew up his house there.
</P>
<P>
   However, Moscow's chief civilian envoy to Chechnya, Deputy Prime
Minister Nikolai Koshman, said rebels were to blame for the events
in Alkhan-Yurt. He said residents had told troops there were no
rebels in the village, but advancing soldiers were met with
grenades and gunfire fired from homes, forcing the troops to return
fire.
</P>
<P>
   But in an amateur video made during a visit to Alkhan-Yurt and
shown to reporters last week, Koshman was shown inspecting the
ruins of the village and upbraiding Russian officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll be held personally responsible for this,'' he tells one
officer in the video, whose contents were first reported by the
BBC. ``I've never seen anything like it anywhere in Chechnya.''
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers in Mozdok said General Shamanov could be soon removed
because of his troops' actions; last week, a commission of superior
officers reprimanded him, citing the looting by his troops. Among
other things, military sources said investigators found that troops
had taken numerous rugs from Chechen homes.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow Thursday, US Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott
met with with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and said later
that Russia had broken international norms by indiscriminately
targetting civilians in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Chechens, Talbott said, ``don't want to see themselves treated
as terrorists and enemies, not to mention victims of indiscriminate
killing and driving people from their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia has shaken off criticism from the West, saying the war in
Chechnya is an internal matter. Officials say foreigners fail to
understand the wave of terror that Moscow says was generated by
hundreds of kidnappings and general lawlessness that marked the
region's three years of de facto independence.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops entered Chechnya after Islamic militants invaded
the neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan and Moscow and other
cities were hit by a wave of deadly apartment bombings, which
Moscow blamed on Chechen rebels. The separatists have denied
responsibility for the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military, out to avenge its defeat in its 1994-1996
war against Chechnya, has waged a relentless and savage assault
that has enjoyed a wave of popular support in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, whose leadership of the Chechen
campaign has won him a 70 percent popularity rating in polls, told
a government meeting Thursday that Russian forces were meeting only
``pockets of resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost all the territory of Chechnya is now controlled by the
federal forces,'' Putin declared.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of Russian forces in Chechnya, Colonel General
Viktor Kazantsev, predicted in an interview published in the
military paper Krasnaya Zvezda that the war would end in ``two or
three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Russian forces launched a furious air and artillery
attack on Grozny, despite having promised to keep open ``safe
corridors'' for the estimated 8,000 to 45,000 civilians believed to
be still trapped in the capital. Thousands more remained caught in
the foothills to the south, where the only escape corridor, a road
through the high Caucasus mountains into Georgia, was closed by
Russian paratroopers last week.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said Thursday
that her office would investigate claims by refugees and rights
groups that refugees were being forced to return to a war zone.
Foreign aid workers have avoided the North Caucasus after hundreds
of people were kidnapped for ransom after Russian troops withdrew
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Now the troops are back, and, Moscow says, they are finding and
freeing hostages held by Chechen captors. This month, troops sent
home a 12-year-old girl who had been kidnapped from a neighboring
region and kept in a basement in Chechnya for months.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, such stories provide ample justification for what
Russian are doing. But in the Caucasus, Chechen civilians fear what
will happen to them if they return home, and stories like
Alkhan-Yurt do not make it any easier.

UN, WOMAN AT ODDS OVER $700,000 DEPOSIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAURIA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Susan Madakor lives in a housing project in Brooklyn.
Two years ago, as mysterious wire transfers started depositing the
first of $700,000 into her bank account, it seemed as though her
dreams would finally be realized.
</P>
<P>
   Madakor says she spent more than a third of the money to pay off
debts and open a laundromat.
</P>
<P>
   Then the money stopped a month ago. She tried to close the
account but found it blocked.
</P>
<P>
   Chase Manhattan Bank and the United Nations discovered that 13
foreign governments had for two years wired money into Madakor's
account instead of into the UN Environment Program's account, which
differs from hers by a single digit.
</P>
<P>
   The voluntary contributions to help clean up the Earth instead
went to Madakor.
</P>
<P>
   The bank immediately froze the $435,000 she had left in various
accounts and told her to return the rest.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Madakor filed a lawsuit in New York State Supreme
Court, alleging that she won the money in an ``international
lottery'' but never received notice of her winnings. She wants
Chase to unfreeze the funds and pay her damages.
</P>
<P>
   Her suddenly deflated lifestyle has left her with bounced checks
and unpaid food and medicine bills, the suit says. A court hearing
is set for Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   The money was transferred in amounts ranging from $12 to ``six
figures,'' said Ken Herz, a Chase spokesman. ``I don't think if you
win a European lottery you get a wire of $12.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Quiblier, a spokesman for the environment program, said
the money was not considered missing because the program is
voluntary and funds are deposited sporadically. Most of the
program's money comes from the regular UN budget, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she tried to close out an account we questioned her and
we weren't satisfied with her responses and we froze the money,''
Herz said. ``It's not her money, it belongs to the United
Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``This lady has spent between $250,000 and $350,000 of
the United Nations' money, yet she wants to keep the rest and seek
damages from us. As far as we're concerned, the $700,000 was the
best thing that ever happened to her and I don't see how it's
damaged her.''
</P>

DOCTOR POPS SUNKEN CHEST BACK INTO SHAPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A twist of the wrist by two surgeons helped give
13-year-old Patrick Delaney a new look to his formerly sunken chest
last Tuesday in a dramatic demonstration of minimally invasive
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts General Hospital surgeons had inserted a bowed
metal bar from one side of Delaney's chest to the other, through
small incisions under each arm.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as if turning a crank, the doctors rotated the rod so that
its arched shape pointed upward, pushing the boy's concave chest
wall outward and giving it a normal contour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those jaw-dropping things,'' said Dr. Daniel
Doody, the MGH pediatric surgeon who performed what appears to be
the first such procedure in Massachusetts. ``Everybody in the
operating room said, `Oh, my goodness!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the standard, invasive operation that involves
cutting the ribs apart from the breast bone and rebuilding the
chest from inside, the new procedure was like popping a dent out of
a car door panel. The ribs can be moved like this because they are
attached to the breast bone at the front and the spine at the back
by flexible cartilage.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday afternoon, Patrick, who was born with what's called
``funnel chest'' or more properly, ``pectus excavatum,'' was being
weaned from pain medications. He hoped to come home Friday, his
third postoperative day. The metal piece, called a strut, that is
supporting the front of his chest will stay there, sewed in place,
for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick's nurse, Anita St. John, has taken care of many children
following the standard operation. This innovation, called the Nuss
procedure after the Virginia surgeon who developed it, ``makes just
an incredible difference'' in recovery time, she said, judging by
Patrick's rapid improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's already been up and walking _ it usually takes a week or
so before they're really walking on their own,'' she said. And his
once-indented chest ``looks completely normal'' without the large
incision scars from the standard operation, she said.
</P>
<P>
   About 1 in 1,000 children are born with a bowed-in chest, said
Doody, the surgeon, and Patrick's was moderate to severe. The boy
said it was like having a soup bowl in his chest.
</P>
<P>
   Many children don't need surgery, but in some patients, like
Patrick, the bent-in ribs actually crowd the heart and lungs. ``I
couldn't run for two minutes, I couldn't ride my bike as fast or as
far as my friends, and I couldn't keep up with my friends in
sports,'' Patrick said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The standard method of repair involves, first, making a
``nipple-to-nipple'' lateral incision, said Doody, and then lifting
the chest and abdominal muscles away from the ribs. The ribs are
attached to the sternum, or breastbone, by tough but flexible
cartilage, and to reshape the chest, the surgeon removes the
cartilage, freeing the ribs from the sternum.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the sternum is lifted up and held in place by sutures,
while the ribs are positioned so that they will reattach themselves
over a period of months. The operation can cause a lot of bleeding,
though transfusions are rarely needed.
</P>
<P>
   The new procedure was actually invented about 10 years ago by
Dr. Donald Nuss, a surgeon at Children's Hospital of The King's
Daughters in Norfolk, Va. He didn't discuss it much publicly, but
in 1997 published his accumulated results, drawing a lot of
attention. Doody and his partner, Dr. Daniel Ryan, visited Nuss in
September and learned the procedure from him.
</P>
<P>
   In fixing Patrick's chest, the surgeons first chose a rod of the
right size, 13 inches long, and bent it to fit what would be the
normal curve of his chest.
</P>
<P>
   The small incisions under his arms allowed the surgeons, looking
inside the chest with a video-equipped instrument, to tunnel
through the chest tissue, bypassing the heart and lungs, clear to
the other side.
</P>
<P>
   A long piece of tape (the same kind used to tie babies'
umbilical cords) was passed through the tunnel and then was used to
pull the metal bar through the same space until both ends of the
bar protruded on either side.
</P>
<P>
   Then Doody and Ryan, using handles attached to the bar, rotated
it 180 degrees in one smooth motion, pushing the chest up so that
it formed a normal curvature.
</P>
<P>
   ``After seeing it, I was impressed,'' said Doody. ``After doing
it, I was even more impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so every surgeon who repairs chest deformities, however. Dr.
Robert Shamberger, a pediatric surgeon at Children's Hospital who
performs most of the pectus excavatum repairs there, said, ``We are
awaiting further support that it's associated with less
complications and optimal results.''
</P>
<P>
   Shamberger said the conventional operation really isn't that
traumatic and patients are out of the hospital in three or four
days. Some surgeons have adopted the Nuss procedure but then
dropped it after complications occurred, Shamberger said.
</P>
<P>
   Doody, however, remains enthusiastic after carrying out
Patrick's repair. ``He's already better'' than other young patients
who've had the standard operation,'' the surgeon said. ``He's way
ahead of them.''

CATHOLIC CHARITY HELPS POOR PALESTINIAN FAMILY IN BETHLEHEM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIT JALLA, West Bank _ Up a dusty gravel path not far from the
lighted square and gilded grotto that mark the traditional
birthplace of Jesus, a plastic Christmas tree, small and bare,
graces a corner of the Masou family's living room.
</P>
<P>
   No ornaments hang from the tree, no presents lie underneath it
and none of the five children in the Palestinian family expects any
to appear by Christmas Day.
</P>
<P>
   Like many among Bethlehem's Christian community, the Masous are
poor. Their living room is cold, chilled by a steady winter wind
that breezes through windows that the family hasn't yet been able
to afford to cover with glass.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this Christmas, they tell a visitor, is the best one yet.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few months ago, the seven family members lived together
in one room in a relative's small house next door, while the
father, a house painter, slowly built his own home.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of Caritas, the Roman Catholic Church's charity,
they put enough finishing touches on the house to move in just the
other day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so cramped before, we never felt like it was
Christmas,'' said Ibtisam Masou, the family's 33-year-old mother.
``I couldn't relax. The kids were always fighting. Now we can do
what we want. We're comfortable here.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Caritas gave no-interest loans of about $2,000 to 50
needy Christian families in the Bethlehem area. It's not much, but
the money helps to ease the poverty of Bethlehem's vanishing
Christian population and thus, Christian leaders hope, stem the
tide of emigration.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, the town of Jesus' birth was 90 percent Christian,
according to officials. Today, just 35 percent of its 30,000 people
are Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 13,000 inhabitants in neighboring Beit Jalla, the
Bethlehem suburb where the Masous live, the Christian population
stands at 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Most live in hilly communities that flank either side of
Bethlehem, along cramped and narrow alleys that the tourists rarely
see. Some survive by carving Christian figurines out of olive wood
to sell in souvenir shops.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Munir Masou, work odd jobs in construction and
carpentry in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Few make more than $1,000 a month, and that's where the
charities come in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Christian community doesn't receive much help so we try to
fill in the gap,'' said Edward Dabdoub, the administrative director
of Caritas. ``We don't like to be too public about it. We could
never fulfill the demand. But we do help an average of 45 families
a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Masou family's new house is small and unfinished,
they now have the relative luxury of living in three bedrooms,
instead of one, a necessity now that the eldest daughter, Navine,
has turned 12.
</P>
<P>
   With the younger children sleeping in one room and the parents
in another, Navine has a room all her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cold, but I'm not afraid to sleep alone anymore,'' she
said. ``I can move more freely here.''
</P>
<P>
   And the house seems to have helped ease the children's
disappointment over a Christmas likely spent without presents.
Navine wants a mystery book, Nasri and Amir, boys aged 11 and 10,
want remote-controlled toy cars, and 3-year-old Mary would like
some chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   But the children seem to understand that their parents are
struggling just to pay back loans for their new house and cannot
afford to put any presents under the tree.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought his father would bring him a toy car, Nasri
shrugged. ``I didn't ask for anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the children have set their sights on the celebrations
set here for Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Only 3 percent of West Bank Palestinians are Christians. Most,
like the Masou family, are Greek Orthodox, which means they mark
Christmas on Jan. 7, according to the Eastern calendar.
</P>
<P>
   But the big night for everyone here is still Friday, when
leaders of all the Christian denominations will gather at Manger
Square and choirs from around the world will sing. That's when
Nasri and Amir will join others in their Boy Scout troop to parade
along the streets of Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
   By spring, the Masous hope to buy glass windows for the house.
The first loan from Caritas was spent putting tiles on the floor,
painting the walls and building the window frames, which made the
place livable.
</P>
<P>
   The family has applied for another loan of $1,000 to buy glass
panes, however, Caritas' administrators have not yet approved the
request.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I put presents under the tree, but not this year,''
said Ibtisam Masou, whose long brown hair tied in a ponytail makes
her look even younger than her 33 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this year will be better,'' she said. ``I'll take the kids
and go to church. Then my family will come here to visit. It will
be nice because we'll have room.''
</P>

SEARCH FOR SUSPECT IN OFFICER'S SHOOTING WIDENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JORDANA HART  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hunt for the alleged killer of a popular Holyoke, Mass.
police officer spilled into neighboring states Thursday as scores
of police combed the old mill city for the second day.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone calls continued to pour into Holyoke police
headquarters with sightings of the suspect, 27-year-old Eddie
Morales, and in Lawrence, where he previously lived. Morales had
also lived in Boston, about 80 miles to the east.
</P>
<P>
   State police manned roadblocks around Holyoke during the early
morning hours, said Sergeant George Girard.
</P>
<P>
   Morales, who, officials said, has an extensive record of drug
arrests, allegedly pumped five bullets into Patrolman John A.
DiNapoli as the plainsclothes officer chased Morales in an unmarked
car Wednesday around 9 a.m. DiNapoli, 52, had volunteered to help
break up a fight. Bullets hit him in the heart, abdomen, shoulder
and arm _ he died at 9:24 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investigation continues and the search continues,'' said
Patrol Officer Jane Deshais. ``We are hearing of sightings
everywhere, and every single one of them is being followed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Melinda Renaudette, a bartender, said she and her son spotted
Morales getting off Interstate 391 near High Street in Holyoke on
Wednesday at about 2:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was driving and he looked straight over at me. There's
another man with him in the passenger seat,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a press briefing, the city's leading Latino
religious leaders, the Rev. Roberto Sierra and the Rev. Miguel
Cruz, said they were establishing two 24-hour hotlines to take
calls about Morales' whereabouts. They particularly urged Morales'
relatives and friends, perhaps too timid to call police, to call
the hotlines instead.
</P>
<P>
   Holyoke has seen its share of problems between police and
Hispanics, including high arrest rates and accusations of
insensitivity by some Latinos against law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relations between Latinos and police have not been at their
best and now this situation strains something that is already
tense,'' said Betty Medina Lichstenstein, director of a Latino
family agency in Holyoke and a former School Committee member.
``Right now, we are trying to help this community move forward as
one, not as a white, a black, and a brown community. We are asking
everyone to please assist us in getting this man arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the magnitude of the crime, Lichtenstein said some in this
city of 45,000 _ half of whom are believed to be Latino _ fear that
Morales on the loose may not come out alive if he resists capture.
She urged him to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   DiNapoli, a 21-year veteran of the force, was on his way back
from dropping another officer off at a courthouse about 9 a.m.
Wednesday when he volunteered to answer a call to break up an
argument between two men on a street corner. He was still in his
cruiser when he was shot several times.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the search for possible leads extended into
Connecticut, about a half-hour drive south from Holyoke, and into
New Hampshire, just north of Lawrence.

<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a tale of two economies and of the intertwined stock
markets that track them and are sending out wildly confusing
messages. One market is in a speculative blowoff; the other may be
in a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   The more exciting of the economies is the new one, the
Internet-driven high-technology model that has captivated
investors. That is the economy that has caused the Nasdaq composite
index to leap 48 percent in 10 weeks. Companies in that market are
showered with capital, and new issues routinely double in price on
the first day of trading.
</P>
<P>
   But the other economy _ the old non-Internet one that still
accounts for most economic activity _ is starting to slow, and many
of the stocks in it are weak. Soaring tech stocks have pushed the
Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks up more than 18 percent in
1999, but most of the stocks in the index have gone down. On both
the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, two-thirds of the stocks
are down at least 20 percent from their peaks.
</P>
<P>
   The old economy's stock market is reacting to the economic
forces that usually affect markets. Interest rates are up, and the
Federal Reserve is hinting that more increases lie ahead. Oil
prices have doubled, and wage pressures are growing.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar may be vulnerable, with the trade deficit at an
unprecedented level. If it weren't for the dominance of new economy
stocks in market indexes, analysts might be asking whether the
market's weakness was sending a recession warning.
</P>
<P>
   But the new economy stocks are in a Millennium Melt-Up. Doug
Kass, a hedge fund manager, reports that 57 of this year's new
issues now rank among the 200 largest technology companies in the
country, as measured by market capitalization. Most of them have
little if any revenues, no profits and soaring share prices. Their
investors won't be bothered if the Fed raises interest rates again.
</P>
<P>
   What would bother them? Some stocks will collapse when it
becomes clear that their business models are not working. That
could happen to some e-retailers when Christmas-season results are
in. But for most new economy stocks, such a verdict is years away.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those business models, however, rely on ready access to
cheap capital to finance years of losses before the (hoped-for)
bonanza arrives. A change in investor psychology could conceivably
cause some companies that would have succeeded to fold up because
of lack of capital. But there is no indication that will happen
soon.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves us with two stock markets in one. One has many
stocks that seem fairly, or even cheaply, valued by traditional
valuation measures. The other is completely oblivious to such
measures. ``There is,'' says Leon Cooperman, a hedge fund manager,
``an unbridled willingness to speculate, but no willingness to
speculate on value.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed may come in for harsh criticism if the new economy bull
market ends badly. Many billions of dollars may be lost if most of
today's young stars fade into obscurity rather than shoot into
prominence in the real economy, where revenues and profits are
important.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps those losses will damage the overall economy, just as
the profits from soaring stock prices have helped to pump up
consumer spending. Then the critics will want to know why the Fed
did not slow the speculation before it got out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not clear what the Fed could have done, or can do now.
Stock markets can take on a life of their own, and the new economy
market has done that. It may be that all the Fed can do is watch
and worry.

   RUSSIA-TALBOTT (Moscow) _ Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott ends two days of talks on a sour note, accusing Russia of
``indiscriminate killing'' in Chechnya and without breaking a
lingering stalemate between Washington and Moscow over a major arms
control treaty. As Russian forces continue to pound rebel positions
in the breakaway republic of Chechnya, Talbott offered some of the
harshest American criticism to date of the Kremlin's military
campaign. By Celestine Bohlen. (The story has moved in ``i'' news

the verge of declaring his candidacy for the Senate and needs

   JENNE-JENO, Mali _ Standing at the bottom of a 10-foot-deep pit,
in a field where the only other activity came from a nomadic
herdsman urging his cows to munch on yellowing shrub, the American
archaeologist and his African students were surrounded by
tantalizing clues to life here in the oldest African city south of
the Sahara.
</P>
<P>
   A brownish vase lay buried on the pit's floor with its rim
protruding, not far from a pot with a lid. The side of a small red
urn jutted out of a wall. And embedded in a wall at the center of
the pit was the great find of this dig: a big brown urn, perhaps as
old as a millennium, that the archaeologists had sliced in half,
top-down like a pear, to reveal skeletal remains.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of men hoisted the big urn onto a stretcher and
carried it with some urgency, as if it were a patient not beyond
resuscitation, to a Land Rover nearby. The American, Roderick J.
McIntosh, held on to the pot with both hands, trudging with visible
effort under the sun on a field littered with countless pottery
shards and the occasional protruding vase rim.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are thousands of sites like this in Mali,'' said
McIntosh, an archaeologist at Rice University, who has been
excavating sites in this West African country since 1977. ``Next to
Egypt, Mali has the richest deposit of artifacts in Africa. There
are parts of the Sahara here you can't set foot on and not crunch
something underneath.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the wealth of artifacts, little is known of the ancient
history of Mali, or the rest of sub-Saharan Africa, compared with
other areas of the world. In the landlocked territory now occupied
by Mali, great empires _ with names like Ghana, Mali, Songhai _
rose and fell almost silently.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim Arabs crossed the Sahara in the 11th century, and the
texts of Islamic historians then bring some light to life here.
Cities with fabled names like Timbuktu and Djenne, a couple of
miles from here, grew into important centers of Islamic culture and
learning.
</P>
<P>
   The great mosque in Djenne, which stands as the largest
mud-brick building in the world, with a facade that thousands of
townspeople help refresh after every rainy season, was restored
early this century. Its model, which was built on the same site in
the 11th century, was known as far as Europe.
</P>
<P>
   What was here, though, before Islam? The long held, if
simplified, view was that Islam brought the features of
civilization to West Africa: cities, trade, commerce, organized
political structures, professions. But research in the last two
decades, whether in the land of the Yoruba in southwest Nigeria, or
here in the Niger River basin of Mali, strongly suggests that some
of those developments preceded the religion's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Today, nothing much survives of Jenne-Jeno except its ruins. And
even though McIntosh's research suggests that the city died around
the 12th century, for reasons that remain unclear, people in the
area seemed aware that a place called Jenne-Jeno once existed just
outside Djenne.
</P>
<P>
   Jenne-Jeno was surrounded by a 1.3-mile wall that was 12 feet
thick at its base, McIntosh said, standing among the remains of the
structure. From the artifacts he has dug up over the years, he
surmises that masons, blacksmiths, fishermen and weavers lived
together in a sign that urban life permitted divisions of labor.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the discovery of similar possessions and tools in
most houses suggests that the inhabitants enjoyed comparable social
status, and were not ruled by a despot _ the political structure
that was widely believed to have produced the beginning of urban
living in West Africa. The unearthing of materials like gold and
copper, which are not found in the region, point to long-distance
trade and commerce well before Arabs established the trans-Saharan
trade routes in the 11th century.
</P>
<P>
   Radiocarbon dating of scores of relics showed that those found
deepest in the soil went back to 250 years before Jesus, making
Jenne-Jeno the oldest known city in sub-Saharan Africa. At its
height, McIntosh estimated, more than 15,000 people lived in the
city of 68 to 85 acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would have been Chinese cities bigger than that, but not
by much,'' he said. ``And only a handful of European cities would
have been of that size.''
</P>
<P>
   The artifacts go up to the 12th century and Jenne-Jeno's
mysterious death. Did the increase in trade bring diseases that
wiped out its inhabitants?
</P>
<P>
   Boubacar H. Diaby, an archaeologist and head of Mali's ministry
of culture and tourism division in Djenne, says the absence of
Islamic relics in Jenne-Jeno suggests that its inhabitants
converted to Islam and moved to Djenne.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all the findings, you can tell that they precede the
arrival of Islam,'' Diaby said. ``For example, people are buried in
urns sitting up, not lying down in the Islamic way. It's possible
that the people of Jenne-Jeno left this animist city, but kept it
untouched because of their ancestral ties to it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some questions may never be answered. Although a preservation
campaign by Diaby has stopped looting around Jenne-Jeno in the last
decade, illegal digging continues in Mali. The site here bears the
scars of looters: crudely dug holes that have created depressions
where water has accumulated and grass now grows, effectively making
it impossible for archaeologists to study the area.
</P>
<P>
   For years, looters fed African art dealers in Paris and Brussels
with Malian artifacts, especially prized statuettes with human or
animal shapes that sold for thousands of dollars. A five-year
campaign with the strong endorsement of President Alpha O. Konare,
an archaeologist by training who dug alongside McIntosh in
Jenne-Jeno in 1977, has slowed the traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term goal, Diaby said, is to use Mali's cultural legacy
to develop tourism. It is a daunting task in one of the world's
poorest nations. Roads are bad; gas stations few; Djenne, which
becomes an island in the rainy season when the Bani River floods,
does not even have a bridge for cars. From independence in 1960 to
the early 1990s, socialist or military governments ruled this
country of 10 million people, and kept it closed off to the
outside.
</P>
<P>
   Diaby pointed to the example of another West African country,
Ghana, where tourism was nonexistent until several years ago. Using
its critical role in the history of the trans-Atlantic slave trade,
Ghana has made tourism one of its leading industries.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in Mali, Diaby said, developing tourism is something
of a race against the clock, against indifference, erosion and
looting.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's hard to tell a poor peasant that he shouldn't dig
because it will preserve his cultural identity,'' Diaby said,
standing not too far from a pit where Malian students would find a
pot an hour later, ``and that sometime in the future his culture, a
place like Jenne-Jeno, might bring development.''

ON NEW YEAR, EVEN JAPAN'S PRIME MINISTER WILL BE ON DUTY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ While President Clinton and many other world leaders
will be attending lavish banquets or otherwise feting the arrival
of the new millennium, Japan's prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, will
reportedly be cloistered with senior aides throughout the night
just in case major Y2K problems erupt.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi's caution may be owing to a recent history of weak
government responses to disasters, from the 1995 Kobe earthquake to
this year's accident at a nuclear fuel plant at Tokaimura.
</P>
<P>
   Elections must be held sometime in the next 10 months, and with
the economy in uncertain health, Obuchi's political advisers seem
to have decided that it is prudent for him to appear to be on the
case.
</P>
<P>
   For two weeks already, the prime minister has been appearing in
television announcements warning of the possible consequences of
computer mishaps, even as he seeks to reassure the public. ``We do
not think any major confusion will occur, but you are advised to
prepare for the one-in-ten-thousand chance of trouble,'' Obuchi
says in one of his announcements. ``May everyone have a peaceful
New Year.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, given the almost martial feel of Japan's preparations for
the problem _ in which some computers may malfunction after
midnight on Dec. 31 _ many here wonder if a real shock is in store.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the government has placed 96,000 soldiers on
alert over the New Year's weekend, and ordered that the top 160
officers of the country's military remain on duty.
</P>
<P>
   In Tokyo, 24,000 police officers will be on duty, far more than
the ordinary level of 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of mid-level bureaucrats are being ordered to report
to work. And as is the case in many other countries, employees of
computer, securities and other industries highly dependent on
computers have been ordered to cancel their year-end vacations to
be on call in case of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   People with long experience of Japan say this country's reaction
to the Y2K problem reflects more on the political and corporate
culture than it does on the preparation for the possible computer
glitch, which most experts here say has been thorough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever they see a problem coming, they just throw people at
it, and that is exactly what is happening here,'' said John
Neuffer, a senior research fellow at the Mitsui Kaijyo Research
Institute in Tokyo. ``They are putting an awful lot of people on
duty, essentially to cover their backsides. Japan is really a
worst-case-scenario culture, where people imagine the worst, and
this is what they prepare for.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of the extra workers being thrown into action, Japan has
not merely chosen a human wave approach to the problem. Indeed, if
initially the country seemed a bit slow to react to the challenge,
the last several months have been marked by a highly aggressive
readiness campaign, both in government and industry.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most mundane events of daily life, from riding the
subway to entering an elevator, are accompanied by recorded warning
messages spoken by women with squeaky voices.
</P>
<P>
   According to the prime minister's task force, at the
government's insistence ``all major banks, regional banks and
second tier regional banks'' completed major systems corrections
and millennium dry runs by the end of September.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been working on this since 1996, and have had a
special team in place since April 1998,'' said Kazuyuki Hashimoto,
a spokesman for Daiwa Securities, Japan's third-largest brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's financial markets have an added advantage of a public
holiday on Jan. 3, which means that on the Monday when the rest of
the world's stock markets and banks will discover if they have
serious computer problems, this country will still be closed for
business. If there is havoc in any major international market,
officials here say, at least Japan will have the luxury of a day's
warning.
</P>
<P>
   Public utilities, airports, airlines and hospitals, meanwhile,
have performed similar industrywide blanket checks, government and
industry officials say. To be extra safe, service will be
interrupted for several minutes on the country's rail and subway
lines, which will run all night to accommodate revelers.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, major hotels and other large buildings say their
elevators will be taken out of service shortly before midnight, and
tested for several minutes afterward, to make sure that they work
properly.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had any particular areas of concern in Tokyo, one of
the world's largest and most densely populated cities, Shintaro
Ishihara, the governor of Tokyo prefecture, said that although he
remained vigilant, he could not pinpoint any particular area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come up with the best measures we could,'' he said.
``But even at that, there are limits to what you can do. There are
millions of systems with chips out there, and even if you check
with their manufacturers, you can't always know what will happen.
We will simply have to wait until the New Year to see.''

COMMENTARY: WHERE WERE YOU IN 1002? 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe a millennium is too big a thought. There's a lot of
resistance to this celebration. If we were just turning over a
century, people might have found it easier to wrap their minds
around the whole concept. Or they could be afraid that if they
engage in a conversation about the last 1,000 years, somebody will
ask for their opinion of the Song dynasty or the St. Bryce's Day
massacre.
</P>
<P>
   And of course we're being deflected by critics who complain that
the real turn of the millennium won't happen until Jan. 1, 2001.
(Note to the 2001 purists: It doesn't matter. The whole thing is
arbitrary, and we're in it for the zeroes.)
</P>
<P>
   This great, if totally artificial, event has at least one
important story to tell us. It's that no people has a lock on
history. The nations and ethnic groups that look as if they're on
top now were definitely somewhere else 1,000 years ago, and as time
goes on, the wheel will turn again.
</P>
<P>
   The term Dark Ages has gone out of fashion, but I think it's
fair to say that 1,000 years ago Western Europe was evolutionally
challenged. Since the fall of the Roman Empire, things had been
slipping backward.
</P>
<P>
   The West had lost the Greek classics and, if the squabbling of
two 11th-century French correspondents can be believed, the
mathematicians had forgotten what the interior angle of a triangle
looked like. Most people lived in feudal villages, eating what they
grew and producing little else.
</P>
<P>
   Rome was a semi-rural tourist trap, surviving off the pilgrims.
Genoa had declined to a fishing village. England was governed by a
king named Ethelred the Unready; 'nuff said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Cordoba, the Caliph Hakam II had a library of
400,000 manuscripts and supported 27 advanced public schools for
poor but promising students. Muslims, Christians and Jews lived
together more or less amicably. Food was abundant and cheap. Even
the common folk ate meat, fish and fresh fruit at a time when the
famine-racked peasants to the north were eating each other.
</P>
<P>
   Constantinople was the shopping center of the universe. You
entered the city through a gold-plated gate and walked along
streets lined with colonnades to protect pedestrians from the
elements. The streets were paved, lighted at night and policed
around the clock, more amenable to pedestrians than London in the
19th century.
</P>
<P>
   In the Middle East, Baghdad was famous for its culture, wealth
and religious tolerance _ one of the rare places where a poet could
make a good living. ``People immigrate to it from all countries,
both near and far, and everywhere there are men who have preferred
it to their own country,'' reported a 10th-century visitor.
</P>
<P>
   Kumbi Saleh, the capital of Ghana, was another mecca for
travelers and traders. The king could raise an army of 200,000 for
battle, and visitors to his palace said he was the richest monarch
in the world. (It might have been the 30-pound gold nugget he used
to tether his horse.) At night the streets were filled with dancing
and singing.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the visitors to these cities were Jewish
merchant-adventurers who were almost the only navigators willing to
sail the commercial routes from China to Africa to England. At a
time when the world was torn between Christian and Muslim, being
Jewish seemed like a fairly safe, neutral position.
</P>
<P>
   That was at least the thinking of the Khazars, a tribe of nomads
who lived along the Volga River. Deciding that paganism was passe,
the Khazars held a communal debate to choose the most promising
theological direction. They decided to all become Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   We can look back now and realize that Constantinople's culture
had begun to atrophy, and that soon Venice, a little marsh-bound
city with visions of grandeur, would begin stealing away its trade.
</P>
<P>
   By the middle of the 11th century, Cordoba's glory days were
over. Baghdad would be leveled by the Mongols in the 13th century.
China, which had been so far ahead of Europe on almost every front
in 1000, soon began to slow down and become static.
</P>
<P>
   We don't often contemplate the inevitability of our own
civilization's decline, and really there's not much point. We can
no more stop history than the Indians could turn back the
Mayflower. But we can use this moment to remind ourselves that it's
wise to honor the cultures you pass on the way up, since you're
likely to see them again on the way down.

GRAND JURY CONTINUES PROBE IN FBI-MOB CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The federal grand jury that charged retired FBI Special
Agent John J. Connolly Jr. with committing crimes to protect prized
informant-gangsters James ``Whitey'' Bulger and Stephen ``The
Rifleman'' Flemmi is investigating more allegations of FBI
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   A number of current and retired agents have been called in from
around the country to appear before the grand jury in US District
Court in Worcester over the past few months and more agents are
scheduled to testify in the coming weeks, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   US Attorney Donald K. Stern declined to comment on the probe,
other than to say that a task force of out-of-town FBI agents
formed two years ago to scrutinize the FBI's handling of Bulger and
Flemmi is continuing its work.
</P>
<P>
   But sources familiar with the investigation say it is hampered
by the passage of time. While some agents have admitted they failed
to pursue tips that Bulger and Flemmi were involved in drug dealing
or extortion, it happened so many years ago that the five-year
statute of limitations on most federal crimes has run out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the evidence is old,'' said one source familiar with
the investigation, noting that Bulger, 70, has been a fugitive
since his indictment in January 1995 on racketeering charges and
Flemmi, 65, has been jailed since then while awaiting trial in that
case.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly, 59, was charged Wednesday in a five-count racketeering
indictment with Bulger and Flemmi just as the statute of
limitations was about to run out on the most recent alleged crime:
that Connolly tipped off Bulger, Flemmi, and New England Mafia boss
Francis ``Cadillac Frank'' Salemme on the eve of their January 1995
indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Boston attorney R. Robert Popeo, who represents Connolly, said
it is obvious that Salemme, who pleaded guilty on Dec. 9 to
racketeering charges, testified against his client before the grand
jury.
</P>
<P>
   The Connolly indictment alleges that he warned Salemme during a
meeting in early 1994 that he was under investigation by a grand
jury and promised to alert him, through Flemmi, when he was about
to be indicted.
</P>
<P>
   Salemme ``will tell them anything they want to hear,'' said
Popeo, noting that Bulger and Flemmi had provided the FBI with
information about the criminal activities of Salemme and other
mobsters for years.
</P>
<P>
   Also, it was Connolly who arrested Salemme in New York City in
the early 1970s when he was wanted for attempted murder in
Massachusetts for maiming an attorney by blowing up his car.
Salemme served 15 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``First you have Bulger and Flemmi as the sources of information
that brings down organized crime,'' said Popeo. Now, he said, the
people they informed on, like Salemme, are being allowed to testify
against agents like Connolly. ``It's hardly objective evidence,''
Popeo said.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly is charged with protecting Bulger and Flemmi beginning
in 1975, when he first cultivated Bulger as an FBI informant, and
continuing through 1995. He allegedly tipped them off to
investigations and falsified FBI reports to cover up their
involvement in extortion, loansharking, bookmaking, and drug
dealing.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly, who retired from the FBI in December 1990 after 22
years, is also accused of funneling payoffs totaling $7,000 from
Bulger and Flemmi to his former FBI supervisor, John Morris, during
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   It was Morris, who was granted immunity from prosecution, who
offered some of the most damning testimony against Connolly during
hearings in federal court last year that unmasked the FBI's
relationship with Bulger and Flemmi.
</P>
<P>
   Morris admitted pocketing $7,000 in payoffs from Bulger and
Flemmi and claimed Connolly delivered two payments of $1,000 each.
He also claimed that he and Connolly tipped off Bulger and Flemmi
to investigations. But Flemmi testified that the money was paid
directly to Morris and that Morris was the one who warned him of
the indictment five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Several agents admitted during the hearings that they failed to
pursue tips against Bulger after Connolly assured them they were
not true and reminded them that Bulger was a valuable informant.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Kenneth Fishman, who represents Flemmi, accused
prosecutors Thursday of a ``whitewash'' for indicting Connolly for
conduct that he contended was blessed by his superiors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is hoping that the public will conclude there
is one bad apple in the FBI, rather than acknowledge that these
relationships were approved at the highest levels of the FBI and
the Justice Department,'' Fishman said.

MERCHANTS WARY OVER LAST-MINUTE VISIT FROM FIRST PROCRASTINATOR 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Eds.: This story, sent and held yesterday, is now released for
publication.)  (nk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton plans to embark on his annual
Christmas shopping trip on Friday afternoon, joining thousands of
other procrastinating holiday shoppers searching for the perfect
gift.
</P>
<P>
   The news has shopkeepers here alternating between delight and
dread at the prospect of a presidential visit and the disruption it
can create.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he is buying something, he is usually pretty generous,''
said Andrew Twillman, vice president of the Washington Pen Co. at
Union Station, a mall at the train station here. ``But if he
doesn't buy anything, you are shut down for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Twillman, who noted that Clinton has made 11th-hour purchases
from him in the past, said that the section of the mall where the
president shops is blocked off from the rest of the shopping area.
And Clinton's last-minute shopping occurs at a prime time for
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is publicity, but two hours of business as usual the day
before Christmas would be pretty good,'' Twillman added.
</P>
<P>
   Others like the novelty of seeing the president doing his own
shopping for the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   David Mowery, the historical consultant and salesman at
Political Americana, a shop in the Union Station mall that sells
political memorabilia, said he was expecting the president this
year, and would wait for him to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   The store displays old campaign buttons and bumper stickers,
``Mondale and Ferraro for America,'' and campaign posters,
``Kennedy for President _ Leadership for the 60's.'' Democratic
merchandise lines one side of the store, Republican items on the
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will point him toward the Democrat side,'' Mowery said,
adding that the president, who he referred to as the First
Customer, has a collection of political buttons. ``I am absolutely
looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the store had some new FDR buttons, and one from
William Jennings Bryan, that he would like to show Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A large photograph of the president inspecting the showcase of
political buttons hangs at the entrance to the store. Clinton
visited in 1997 while shopping with his daughter, Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Camp, manager of Brookstone, a specialty gift shop, said
he was ``well-informed of the traditional visit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to meet him, even with the checkered history,''
Camp said, adding that if the president asked for recommendations,
he would point to what he called the store's ``tempurpedic
products,'' which are promoted as relieving pressure and stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I might suggest the massage chair,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Clinton did the bulk of his shopping at a store in
the Peace Corps headquarters in downtown Washington _ a building
that Hillary Rodham Clinton dedicated in September 1998 _ before
joining Chelsea for their traditional Christmas Eve shopping
excursion at the Union Station mall. The Peace Corps store sells
merchandise from countries around the world and uses the proceeds
to support Peace Corps volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time this year, said Nanda Chitre, a White
House spokeswoman, Clinton skipped at least one early trip to the
mall in favor of shopping online. From his antique wooden desk in
the Oval Office, he used a Compaq laptop computer adorned with the
presidential seal to order jewelry and children's books. The
president ordered horsehair bracelets from a Web site run by a
private nonprofit group that helps raise money for the people of
the Oglala Lakota Nation in southwestern South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chitre said the president's practice was to pick things up
on trips, particularly international trips, so he might already
``have a stockpile of gifts.''
</P>
<P>
   Twillman, at the pen company, with his eye on the bottom line,
did finally yield a bit on the prospect of serving the president of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would welcome him with open arms,'' he said. ``I just wish
he would come back in January.''

MCCAIN UNDER ATTACK IN TV AD SPONSORED BY CONSERVATIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Bill dal Col is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Welcome to the front of the pack, Senator McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Just two days after Governor George W. Bush of Texas said he
would begin sharpening his differences with Senator John McCain of
Arizona, a conservative activist group has launched a scathing
television advertising campaign in New Hampshire that charges
McCain with hurting Republicans and the conservative movement.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial lambastes McCain for helping ``labor unions,
trial lawyers, and pro-abortion groups'' with his campaign finance
legislation, and pictures the face of the senator morphing into
President Clinton's. The antitax group spent $100,000 on a
three-week advertising campaign that began Wednesday night on
WMUR-TV, said Grover Norquist, president of the Washington-based
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the only Republican candidate approved by the liberal New
York Times,'' the announcer in the ad intones. ``Bill Clinton, Al
Gore and big labor all endorse his top legislative priority.
Senator John McCain _ helping Democrats pass a campaign finance
bill that would keep the Republican Party from fighting the liberal
national media.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's bill, cosponsored by Senator Russell Feingold, a
Wisconsin Democrat, would ban unlimited ``soft money''
contributions to parties or other organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Norquist said he had no contact with the Bush campaign and paid
for the advertising with money collected from his 90,000 members.
Though he has praised Bush for his tax plan, Norquist said he has
not endorsed any candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other candidates are not in this fight,'' Norquist said.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the cosponsor of McCain's campaign finance bill,
Senator Russell Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat, Norquist said, ``We
will stop the ads as soon as McCain stops trashing the First
Amendment and withdraws his support from Feingold's legislation
that would be so damaging to the conservatives.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack ad immediately raised suspicions among campaign
officials for McCain and Steve Forbes that Bush was using an
intermediary to do battle on his behalf. It was only a few weeks
ago that a group called the Republican Leadership Council _ which
has numerous ties to Bush _ paid for a television ad warning Forbes
against running negative commercials, even though Forbes had not
done so.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Governor Bush has anything nasty to say about John McCain,
he should step up and say it himself,'' said Bill dal Col, Forbes's
campaign manager. ``He shouldn't hide behind third-party groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Dal Col, who called for Norquist to pull the ad off the air,
said it was particularly outrageous to blend McCain's likeness with
Clinton's: ``Anyone who would dare show John McCain morphing into
Bill Clinton had better look into the mirror. The evil they see is
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Duprey, GOP chairman in New Hampshire, said he does not
believe Bush had anything to do with the ad. But he, too, said he
was outraged by the suggestion that McCain is anything like
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``For them to engage in this kind of negative, nasty, and
distorted and unfair advertising is a disgrace to the New Hampshire
primary,'' Duprey said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain officials Thursday would not directly point the finger at
the Bush campaign. But Peter Spaulding, McCain's New Hampshire
chairman, said, ``The real question is, who is paying for these
ads? Norquist should release the names of his contributors and tell
the American people who is really behind this attack.''
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, Texas, spokesman Ari Fleischer said the Bush campaign
had nothing to do with the new television spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a very heavy burden on anybody who would make
such a suggestion to back it up with proof,'' Fleischer said.
``Governor Bush has been the victim of many such independent
negative attack ads and he hasn't complained. It's part of being a
front-runner.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Sierra Club has been running a television ad in New
Hampshire that excoriates Bush for his handling of the environment
in Texas. Another ad, paid for by a little-known presidential
contender from Florida, accuses Bush of having a cocaine and
alcohol problem and says he cannot handle the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is McCain's dedication to overhauling the campaign
finance system and eliminating unregulated, unlimited ``soft
money'' donations to political parties that has been a source of
the unbridled animus some have felt toward him for years.
</P>
<P>
   In September, a group of conservatives from the National Rifle
Association, the National Right to Life Committee, the Christian
Coalition, the American Conservative Union and Americans for Tax
Reform assembled in Concord, N.H., to denounce McCain and his
campaign finance legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The subject came up again last week at McCain's town hall
meeting in Claremont, N.H. with Bill Bradley, the former Democratic
senator from New Jersey who is also running for president. A member
of the New Hampshire Citizens for Life told McCain that his bill
would hurt his group's ability to communicate its views to voters.
McCain told the man that he had delivered ``a very clever
misrepresentation of my position.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Norquist said in an interview that conservatives are
upset with McCain for not including in his bill so-called
``paycheck protection,'' which would allow union members to block
their dues from being used for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   While McCain favors that idea, he dropped the provision in order
to win Democratic support for the overall ban on soft money. On
Monday in Manchester, Bush told The Boston Globe that McCain's
legislation would hurt the Republican party by leaving labor unions
free to contribute to Democratic causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that the kind of leadership you want?'' Bush asked. ``I
can't imagine, `Elect me, I'm the kind of leader willing to hurt
the party.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said in the interview that he planned to spend the
month of January letting voters know that he has differences with
McCain on campaign finance, taxes and education. Thursday, a new
poll by the American Research Group showed McCain leading Bush in
New Hampshire by 39 to 30 percent, with a margin of error of plus
or minus 4 percent.

CLINTON PARDONS PORT CHICAGO 50 SURVIVOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton issued a pardon Thursday to
Freddie Meeks, one of the last survivors of the Port Chicago 50, a
group of black sailors whose convictions on mutiny charges during
World War II became a civil rights cause and helped spur
integration of the armed services.
</P>
<P>
   After a huge accidental explosion killed 320 men, sank two Navy
vessels and flattened the docks at Port Chicago north of San
Francisco in 1944, Meeks and 49 others refused to go back to their
jobs loading ammunition aboard ships.
</P>
<P>
   The 50 black stevedores believed that the dangers of their work
had been downplayed by the then-segregated Navy because the
enlisted members of the loading crews were all black. Meeks and
others asked for combat duty instead, but they were prosecuted for
mutiny, convicted, and jailed.
</P>
<P>
   Meeks, 80, who lives in Los Angeles and is in frail health after
suffering a stroke this fall, was informed of the pardon Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we had a good president and I figured he would do the
right thing, and he did the right thing,'' Meeks told the
Associated Press. ``I appreciate it very much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yes, he's happy,'' added his wife, Eleanor Meeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy, as recently as 1994, had refused to expunge the
convictions. William J. Perry, who was then defense secretary, told
Congress that ``sailors are required to obey the orders of their
superiors, even if those orders subject them to life-threatening
danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Loading ammunition onto ships was an essential part of the war
effort, the Navy said, and was no more dangerous than combat. Since
a Marine ordered to move forward to attack a machine-gun nest did
not have the right to question orders, the Navy argued, then
neither should an ammunition handler.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also gave presidential pardons to 36 other Americans
Thursday in a traditional Christmas-season practice, using a power
granted him by the Constitution. But Meeks was the only one of
three surviving mutineers to file an official request with the
White House, said Brian Busey, a Washington-based attorney who
represented Meeks at no charge.
</P>
<P>
   Because the servicemen were convicted and served time in prison
so long ago, the action Thursday was largely symbolic. Jack
Crittenden, another of the Port Chicago 50, declined to join Meeks
and told reporters that a pardon would be an empty gesture. A third
survivor, Busey said, is thought to be living in South Carolina and
did not petition the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The July 17, 1944, explosion of more than 3 million pounds of
ammunition obliterated Port Chicago, on the Sacramento River.
Windows were shattered in San Francisco, more than 30 miles away.
Most of the 320 men killed were black sailors who had been given no
special training in handling explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Though their white officers were given 30 days leave to recover
from the emotional toll of the disaster, the black enlisted men
were dispatched to the docks to collect the bodies and body parts
of the dead, Busey said.
</P>
<P>
   Scarred by the grisly duty and frightened by the destructive
power of the blast, more than 200 black seamen refused to go back
to work when ordered three weeks later to resume loading
ammunition. Three-fourths of them relented after the Navy
threatened to shoot them as mutineers, but 50 remained steadfast.
Instead of being charged with the lesser offense of disobeying
orders, they were court-martialed for mutiny, convicted by an
all-white panel, and sentenced to 15 years at hard labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us, `You know you could be shot.' But we made up our
mind _ you go back you might be blown to pieces _ so we didn't go
back,'' Meeks recalled. He served 18 months in prison before his
sentence was commuted in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   ``I firmly believe the prosecution and conviction was improper
and racially tinged . . . and replete with a lot of evidence this
would never have happened if they were white sailors,'' Busey said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The civil rights community agreed. Thurgood Marshall, a young
black counsel for the NAACP who would later serve on the US Supreme
Court, represented the seamen in their appeals process. Eleanor
Roosevelt interceded on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Chicago story was told last spring in an NBC-TV movie.
Led by Representative George Miller and Senator Barbara Boxer, both
Democrats from California, 35 members of Congress asked Clinton in
the fall to grant Weeks a pardon. The NAACP, at its convention last
summer, passed a resolution calling on Clinton to pardon the Port
Chicago survivors.

PACKAGES FROM GERMANY TO GET X-RAY TREATMENT, US SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Responding to an FBI warning of a possible
terrorist threat, the US Postal Service will X-ray every package
and parcel arriving from Frankfurt to check for bombs, government
officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of an abundance of caution,'' the public is urged not to
open any parcel from Frankfurt if the sender is unknown or the
package is not expected, the FBI said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the FBI nor the Postal Service would discuss how the
threat of a mail bomb was discovered, who might be behind it, or
why the German city is believed to be the origin of a possible
threat.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI statement said the threat that ``individuals'' might
post a bomb to a US address were ``unsubstantiated.'' But
government officials _ even while urging Americans not to panic _
are on high alert following the recent arrests of several
suspicious people entering the country.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement fueled fears that a terrorist group might use
the occasion of the millennium to mount an attack against Americans
at home or abroad. Airport and border security already have been
tightened.
</P>
<P>
   As the nation's capital slows down for a holiday rest,
government agencies, ranging from the FBI to the Postal Service,
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the Federal Aviation
Administration, are in high gear, preparing for possible computer
glitches or a terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   But President Clinton and members of his administration appealed
for calm as well as caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice to the American people would be to go about their
business and do what they would intend to do at the holiday season,
but to be a little more aware of people and places,'' Clinton said
on ``Larry King Live'' on CNN Thursday night. ``If you have a hunch
about something, if you see something that's suspicious, you should
report it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were me, I would not . . . refrain from activities,''
the president said. ``I'm going to go out and do my Christmas
shopping. I wouldn't just hunker down until it was all over.''

   Robert Bethel, spokesman for the Postal Service's inspection
division, said parcels from Frankfurt would be X-rayed, but he
would not say what other protective measures would be taken because
he did not want to ``tip off'' potential terrorists. Mail from
Frankfurt comes into 10 airports around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that the American people not be traumatized
over this,'' Bethel said. ``We want people to be alert to this, but
we don't want any panicking.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``if you're not expecting anything from Frankfurt, bells
and whistles should go off,'' Bethel said, and the package should
be immediately turned over to the Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has issued a ``worldwide caution'' to
Americans, urging them to be on the lookout for trouble, especially
if they are in large groups.
</P>
<P>
   The department does not have any specific information on any
particular country or city where a potential attack is suspected,
Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   The White House-sponsored ``America's Millennium'' celebration,
expected to draw many thousands of people on The Mall, will go
ahead as scheduled, with both the president and Hillary Rodham
Clinton present.
</P>
<P>
   At no time did Clinton consider changing his New Year's plans or
staying out of the public crowd to protect himself from a possible
terrorist threat, said White House spokeswoman Nanda Chitre.
</P>
<P>
   The fear of a domestic attack was heightened Dec. 14 when an
Algerian man, Ahmed Ressam, was discovered entering Washington
state with bomb-making materials. Lucia Garofalo, one of two people
arrested earlier this week at the Vermont-Canadian border, has
connections to an international group that has allegedly sponsored
terrorist activities in Algeria and Europe, prosecutors charged
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on Algeria said they did not recognize the name of the
organization, the Algerian Islamic League. The league could be a
splinter group of a terrorist organization, the analysts said. It
is also possible that the name of the group was mistranslated, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   Algeria has been the site of terrorist and counter-terrorist
violence since the early 1990s, when the secular government,
unwilling to hand over power to the Islamic Salvation Front,
canceled the national election.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, a variety of Islamic groups, some of them engaged in
violence, have fought against the government. About 100,000
civilians have died in the struggle.
</P>
<P>
   The largest group, the Armed Islamic Group, or GIA for its
French language acronym, is considered a terrorist organization by
the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the group has attacked targets in Algeria and France.
France colonized Algeria, and Algerian Muslims perceive France to
be supportive of the secular Algerian government, said Gavin
Cameron, senior research associate at the Monterey Institute of
International Studies in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be surprised if the United States was a target,''
Cameron said, ``but the GIA, this year in particular, has become
much less predictable.''

   ITALY: GO-AHEAD FOR D'ALEMA
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema narrowly received agreement from
the lower house of Parliament to start a new administration. The
vote was 310-287, with 18 abstentions. His new center-left
coalition is smaller, but perhaps more cohesive, than the one he
started out with 14 months ago. ``It worries me that my government
is born of a slimmer majority,'' D'Alema told the legislature.
``But it is better than continuing to live with constant
bickering.''

   NORTHERN IRELAND: PRISONER FURLOUGH
</P>
<P>
   Some 335 prisoners, mostly convicted terrorists and murderers,
were sent home for Christmas from prisons around Northern Ireland.
As a sign of confidence in the region's efforts to establish peace,
the Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, allowed eight
prisoners not eligible for the usual parole program to go home as
well. The prisoners are to return in 12 days.

   BRITAIN: LIBEL LAW REVIEW
</P>
<P>
   The government said it would study ways of reforming its libel
laws after it turned out that a former Conservative trade minister
had raised more than $640,000 from supporters in order to bring a
libel action against Mohamed Al Fayed, the owner of Harrods. The
ex-minister, Neil Hamilton, lost the case and incurred more than
$1.6 million in legal costs. One of the concerns raised by the case
is that Hamilton's backers are now liable to pay a further share of
the overall legal costs.

   Authorities said a second van bomb belonging to the Basque
separatist group ETA was timed to explode at the same time as
another van bomb discovered earlier. Both vehicles were on their
way to Madrid when they were found by the police. Interior Minister
Jaime Mayor Oreja said both devices were set to go off at 7:56
p.m., although the exact date and locations are unknown.

of ``an act of aggression against our sovereignty.'' The action
came a day after a new treaty went into effect in which Colombia
and Honduras divided up some 50,000 square miles of Caribbean

YEAR-END BUYING LIFTS MARKET INDEXES TO NEW HIGHS

 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A year-end buying spree drove the three main stock
gauges to new peaks Thursday, with the technology-laden Nasdaq
composite index surging briefly above the 4,000 mark before falling
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing the market exploding to the upside,'' said Daniel
C. Mathisson, a senior trader at D.E. Shaw, citing pressure by
institutions to hold winning stocks for year-end reports and a
general preholiday euphoria that has prevailed in late December for
most of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also pointed to tax strategies, with investors tending
to defer sales of winning stocks until after the new year, when
capital gains taxes will not be due until April 2001. At the same
time, losing stocks were being unloaded to generate deductions for
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 202.16 points, or 1.8
percent, to 11,405.76, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index
rose 22.21 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,458.34. The Nasdaq, which
climbed 32.14 points, or 0.8 percent, to 3,969.44, is now up 81
percent for the year, the biggest jump for any major index since
the Dow soared 81.7 percent in 1915.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a major milestone,'' said Alan Skrainka, chief
strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis. ``But it also should serve
as a warning to investors not to get carried away with technology
stocks and to maintain balance in their portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most recent sessions, advancing stocks substantially
outnumbered declining ones, cheering analysts who have long worried
about poor breadth, with a relative handful of technology issues
accounting for the bulk of gains as market gauges surged into
uncharted territory.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's breadth was the best since late October as 1,932 New
York Stock Exchange issues rose and 1,155 fell. But new lows
continued to outnumber new highs, by 248 to 108.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty is that there's more winners,'' said David G.
Sowerby, a strategist at Loomis Sayles in Detroit. ``The breadth is
looking delightful.''
</P>
<P>
   Sowerby also said that another factor contributing to the rally
was institutions and investors who might have otherwise bought
stocks next week, perhaps those depressed by tax-selling, did so
Thursday to avoid having their transactions caught up in possible
problems related to turn-of the-year computer glitches. Buyers have
three business days to pay for stock.
</P>
<P>
   Trading on the New York Stock Exchange moderated to 728.6
million shares from 844.2 million as many traders and investors
left work early because of the approach of the Christmas holidays.
The markets are closed Friday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Internet stocks were prominent nonparticipants in the rally.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com and eBay, reported to be the two most popular
shopping sites last week, slumped 7 11/16, to 90, and 7 3/16, to
142 5/16, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   But telecommunications and other high-technology stocks were
among the biggest gainers. MCI Worldcom, up 4{, to 81, was the
biggest contributor to the advance of the S&AMP;P 500 while
Hewlett-Packard, up 5 11/16, to 112|, paced the rise in the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 30 Dow components, 25 advanced, nine of them by more than
2 points as basic industry issues like Alcoa, up 2 9/16, to 79[,
and International Paper, up 2\, to 55 13/16, joined financial, drug
and other groups in posting big gains.
</P>
<P>
   Another reflection of the broad nature of the advance was a 1.33
percent climb in the Wilshire 5000 index, which covers nearly every
American public company.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers, up 3{, to 66 11/16, paced the drug group, with
Merck, Schering-Plough and Warner-Lambert each climbing more than 2
points.
</P>
<P>
   Nextel was another of the high-technology winners, leaping 8
7/16, to 105, aided by a PaineWebber report that it stood to
benefit from a reauctioning of wireless licenses. Novell jumped 7\,
to 34 5/16, after a Fahnestock official named it a favorite stock,
likely to grow 35 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Weis Markets, which has been strong lately because a family
dispute has raised speculation about a possible sale, rose 1 7/16,
to 42~, after it authorized an adviser to explore all options.

SEEING WINDFALLS, BIG BANKS FINANCE START-UPS AGAIN

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For venture capitalists, it has never been easier to get rich.
Now even big banks are catching on to the potential profits in
start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, major commercial banks like Chase Manhattan Corp.
have tripled the money they devote to venture capital, the
high-risk, high-return world of financing companies before they go
public. Overall, they'll spend more than $4 billion this year, and
their investments are rising every quarter.
</P>
<P>
   For banks, the appeal of venture capital is obvious. Chase and
its kin are happy to get 8 percent interest on a typical loan. By
contrast, the average venture capital investment in a new company
almost doubled this year. And bank stocks have weakened this year,
while stocks in publicly traded venture capital companies have
soared.
</P>
<P>
   But as banks move deeper into venture capital, they face some
risks of their own. A few banks, notably Chase and Wells Fargo,
have had successful venture units for years; others have little
experience with the hyper-competition of Silicon Valley. Skeptics,
recalling fiascoes like the bust in high-yield bonds of the early
1990s, note that commercial banks have a bad habit of finding
trends just as they peak.
</P>
<P>
   Yet banks have further reasons to jump into venture capital.
Accounting rules give financial institutions flexibility about when
they choose to recognize venture capital profits. Some analysts
worry that banks will apply that power to set aside ``honey pots''
of unrealized profits on successful venture capital investments.
Banks could then take those profits in difficult quarters to hide
problems in other divisions from investors.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Charles Peabody, an analyst for Mitchell
Securities, noted that J.P. Morgan recorded a pre-tax gain of $255
million, or 83 cents a share after taxes, on its venture capital
portfolio in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Companies can realize
gains on shares of nonpublic companies when they sell the
investments at a profit, but what was notable in this case was that
the bank did not even sell its stakes. It simply reappraised them
upward.
</P>
<P>
   That raise let the bank handily beat analyst estimates of its
profit for the quarter by 7 cents a share, Peabody said. Peabody
has a ``sell'' rating on Morgan stock, which has risen 20 percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan said that the write-up was proper and consistent with
accounting rules, which require the bank to measure the fair value
of its investments each quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the potential pitfalls, banks are increasingly
enthusiastic about venture capital, particularly in new companies
with strong prospects in fields like healthcare and technology.
Traditionally, venture capitalists count on a few big winners to
pay for lots of failed investments. This year, the winners are
bigger than ever, thanks to the raging market in technology stocks,
which has allowed even unprofitable companies to sell shares to the
public at enormous valuations.
</P>
<P>
   For all of 1999, venture capital funds that invest in
early-stage companies are expected to post returns of 85 percent,
according to the National Venture Capital Association, compared to
a 15 percent gain so far this year in the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index. During the last five years, early-stage venture
investments have risen 45 percent annually, compared to a 28
percent yearly gain for the S&AMP;P.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is going to be a growing business,'' said Ron
Mandle, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co., a New York
investment firm. ``Chase and some of the other banks are increasing
the amount of investments that they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Big banks have long had private equity divisions that put up
capital for deals too complex or risky for individual shareholders
to finance. But the stepped-up venture financing reverses trends
earlier in the decade, when following years of subpar venture
capital returns, banks largely abandoned the market to focus on
providing equity for management and leveraged buyouts.
</P>
<P>
   That decision has proven costly. During the last five years, the
return on capital devoted to buyouts has averaged just 17 percent
annually, less than half the returns for early-stage venture
financing. And the gap is widening.
</P>
<P>
   ``The buyout game has played its course,'' said John Watkins, a
managing director at J.P. Morgan Capital.
</P>
<P>
   So banks, which in retrospect scaled back their venture
financing at exactly the wrong time, are racing back into the
business. They are being led by Chase and Wells Fargo, two banks
reaping benefits today from their decisions not to abandon venture
capital completely in the lean years.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Through its Chase Capital Partners subsidiary, Chase provided
almost $2 billion in venture and buyout funding in 1999, including
$800 million for investments in technology, telecommunications, and
media companies. Overall, Chase's portfolio includes investments of
$7 billion in more than 500 companies, according to Jeffrey Walker,
a Chase Capital managing partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were investors in the beginning of the Internet,
particularly on the East Coast, where content providers rather than
technology companies are dominant,'' Walker said. ``We're the
largest Internet investors in Latin America.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase's winners include investments in StarMedia Networks, an
Internet portal that focuses on Spanish and Portuguese speakers,
and Geocities, a community Web site Yahoo bought in May for $3.7
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The portfolio is only a tiny fraction of Chase Manhattan's total
assets of $370 billion, but it has had an outsized impact on
Chase's bottom line this year. In total, Chase Capital Partners
contributed $952 million to the bank's profit in the first nine
months of 1999, 17 percent of its pre-tax income during that span.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley, Wells has been the biggest winner. The bank's
Norwest Venture Partners subsidiary earned $550 million on a $12
million investment in the Cerent Corp., a tiny networking equipment
start-up, when Cisco Systems bought Cerent for $7 billion earlier
this year. For all of 1999, Wells Fargo will earn roughly $1.2
billion from its private equity division, more than a fifth of the
bank's total pre-tax profits.
</P>
<P>
   Successes like that have fueled Wells' commitment to the venture
business, said John Whaley, a Norwest Venture partner. The company
nearly doubled its venture financing to $450 million this year,
from $230 million in 1998, and Whaley said he has had no problem
finding places to invest the extra money.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tremendous amount of competition, but there's also a
tremendous amount of new business development,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins of Morgan said his firm shares that view. Morgan will
invest almost $500 million in telecommunications and technology
startups this year, nearly triple its investment three years ago,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology, telecom, and the Internet are undergoing
fundamental change and are really attractive for private equity,''
Watkins said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he thinks Morgan's reputation and worldwide reach
will be increasingly attractive for start-up companies choosing a
venture capital partner. ``We bring a window into a large global
firm that has contacts all over the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Isaak Karaev, the chief executive of Multex.com, a financial
services company that was financed in part by Chase Capital and
went public earlier this year, said that Multex's relationship with
the Chase venture capitalists opened doors throughout the bank. As
a result, ``Chase became one of our reasonably large customers,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some big banks remain wary of venture capital. Despite its name,
Citicorp Venture Capital is largely a provider of buyout financing
for bigger, older companies, and Richard Cashin, its president,
said that his firm has no plans to change.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, traditional independent venture capital firms aren't
exactly quaking at the thought of banks entering their turf. Walter
Kortschak, the managing partner of Summit Partners, a Silicon
Valley venture firm that has invested about $3 billion in
technology start-ups, said he doesn't see banks as serious
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   For now, analysts seem to share that view. They have been
relatively conservative in valuing banks' venture gains, figuring
that the profits are too unpredictable to count on indefinitely.
``If there are huge windfalls, I would tend to discount them,''
Mandle said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That course might be wise. If the boom-and-bust history of
venture capital is any indication, the gains will not continue
forever. Total investment from banks, independent venture capital
firms, corporations like Intel and wealthy individuals is expected
to double to $38 billion in 1999, according to the National Venture
Capital Association. More than half that money, $20 billion, will
go to Internet-related companies, triple the 1998 figure and a
tenfold rise from the level three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the flood of money has not hurt returns. But Whaley
warned that new venture capitalists looking for riches _ banks or
anyone else _ might be disappointed. ``It's tough to get into it
overnight, if that's what people are thinking,'' he said. A
windfall like Wells Fargo's on Cerent, he added, ``is the
culmination of many years in the business.''

BUYING BINGE DRIVES NASDAQ INDEX OVER 4000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The holiday weekend started early on Wall Street Thursday as the
Nasdaq composite index briefly topped 4000 for the first time, less
than two months after passing the 3000 mark. The Dow Jones
industrial average, meanwhle, jingled past its August high to close
up 200 at a record 11,405.76.
</P>
<P>
   The buying binge was driven by computer hardware and Internet
stocks that hit record highs on the last day of trading before
Christmas (the stock and bond markets are closed Friday). On the
New York Stock Exchange, technology advances were also buoyed by
gains in pharmaceutical and oil stocks along with financial
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had rallies before at this time of the year, but the
current speculative frenzy is more extreme than anything we have
seen in this century,'' said Thoms O'Neill, chief investment
officer at Fleet Bank. ``What is concerning is the level of
financial participation by the public in speculative stocks to the
point that when the downturn comes, a lot of investors will be
hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill and others see investors scrambling to own Internet
stocks _ from infrastructure software firms to electronic commerce
``dot-com'' companies _ so they will not be left out of the
Internet economic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Casting aside traditional investment yardsticks of profitablity,
return on assets, and other financial measurements, investors
pushed up tech issues to record levels _ even abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The overseas buying binge toppled market indicators in London,
Paris, and Frankfurt, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest gain was in the United States on the
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite, which hit 4001.63 shortly after
noon _ just 36 trading sessions after it reached 3000 _ before
closing at 3969.50 for a gain of 32.14 points, or 0.8 percent. Even
with the late-afternoon dip, the Nasdaq index has soared 81 percent
this year, with just a week of trading remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``This milestone is nice to watch, but it is not something to
get overly hyperactive about,'' cautioned Richard Babson, president
of Babson-United Investment Advisors Inc. in Watertown. ``None of
these statistics are startling.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors also pushed up Big Board issues as the Dow surged
202.16 points _ a 1.8 percent increase _ to close at a record
11,405.76. The previous record, set Aug. 25, was 11,326.04.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index climbed 22.21 points or 1.6
percent, to a new high of 1458.34. The S&AMP;P has gained more than 18
percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the hefty gains in stocks led all three indexes _
Nasdaq, Dow, and the S&AMP;P _ to rise 1 percent in the first 10
minutes of trading, reaching their highs in the afternoon before
Nasdaq retreated in the last half-hour of trading, mostly from
Internet retailers Amazon.com Inc. and Yahoo! Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these indexes show how technology plays an increasingly
important role in the US economcy,'' said Peter Bennett, head of
equities for State Street Research. ``And with improving economies
in Europe, significant growth in Asia beginning with the recovery
in Japan, and the bottoming out in South America, we should see
continuing improvements next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond tech stocks, pharmaceutical issues also rebounded with
Bristol-Myers Squibb, up 3 1/2 to 66 11/16, and Warner-Lambert, up
2 3/16 to 85 1/8, leading the way. Even smaller drug companies
benefited as the American Stock Exchange's pharmaceutical index
gained 2.67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the record-breaking results reflected the past. Since
1989, US stock markets have gained on eight of the 11 last trading
sessions before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Volume, however, was off on all the exchanges as many traders
got a head start on their three-day holiday weekend. Still, 727
million shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange by the
4 p.m. close, 19 percent below the three-month daily average of 906
million.

CANADA'S LAX IMMIGRATION POLICES MAKE COUNTRY A HAVEN FOR
TERRORISTS
</HEADLINE>
   (See also see TERROR-U.S., TERROR-VOICES) 
(sw) 
 By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ All street and shop signs here, by Quebec provincial
law, must be in French. But walk a few blocks from the modest
bachelor apartment at 1250 Fort Street where Ahmed Ressam lived
under the name of Benni Antoine Noris, and sometimes Mario Roig,
and the signs tell of a rich ethnic bouillabaisse.
</P>
<P>
   Here is Boutique Ali, a shoe repairman, next to Bombay Palace _
Cuisine Indienne, and then, in quick succession, Thai, Chinese,
Italian, Russian and Swiss restaurants, as well as two Middle
Eastern groceries and ``Pandit A.B. Chowdhury, immigrant consultant
for refugee claimant.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Ressam's arrest near Seattle last week and his indictment
Wednesday on charges of trying to smuggle enough bomb-making
material into the United States to flatten a building, that rich
ethnic mix and the loose immigration controls that have made it
possible have come under close scrutiny in Montreal and across
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Officials here have been trying to explain, among other things,
how Ressam managed to remain in the country after his application
for asylum was refused, and then, two months after a warrant for
his deportation was issued, when he was arrested in the spring of
1998 for breaking into automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam seems to have simply melted into the immigrant community
in Montreal, which includes more than 15,000 Algerians, managing to
obtain drivers' licenses under his false names and even a Canadian
passport last February, a year after the initial deportation order,
by using his French-sounding alias and a forged Roman Catholic
baptismal certificate. In Quebec, a baptismal certificate is
sufficient identification to receive a passport.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam was not alone. Critics of the government charge that as
many as 10,000 people a year who are seeking asylum simply vanish
from official view, some smuggling themselves across the porous
border into the United States, many apparently disappearing into
the population here.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
said the United States has had similar problems with asylum
seekers, especially those who file for asylum after being charged
with violating immigration law. A 1995 study by the INS found that
90 percent of these vanished while their applications were pending.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent report by Canada's intelligence agency,
the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, the country's openness
to immigrants has helped make it ``a haven for terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Canadian intelligence official told the Toronto Globe
and Mail that the intelligence agency had been watching Ressam
since shortly after he arrived in early 1994 with a fake French
passport and a tale of being falsely accused and tortured by
Algeria's military government, which is battling Islamic
insurgents. But, he added, the intelligence agency dropped the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been known to us for some time,'' the official was
quoted as saying in Thursday's issues. ``We had to drop it recently
because of lack of resources. We just don't have the time and
people to continue these investigations indefinitely.''
</P>
<P>
   Montreal's Algerians came under closer scrutiny by the city's
police last October, when a team of French counterterrorism
investigators arrived in Canada. Montreal had been plagued with a
rash of car break-ins around the financial district, in which cell
phones and laptop computers were stolen and then peddled on the
street
</P>
<P>
   The French were conducting an investigation based on the arrest
of Fateh Kamel, an Algerian Islamic militant, and they wanted to
question two men they believed to be his lieutenants _ Ressam and
Karim Said Atmani, who the police now say had been directing the
Montreal theft ring. Ressam was not found.
</P>
<P>
   Kamel had fought with Afghan rebels against the Soviets, and was
arrested by the authorities in Jordan last spring and extradited to
France.
</P>
<P>
   According to the French, Kamel had been the leader of a band of
gangster-terrorists who carried out a series of armed robberies and
shootouts around Roubaix in northern France. He had also operated
out of Montreal in the 1990s and may have married a Canadian woman,
and purportedly directed a loose group of Islamic terrorists, some
of them veterans of fighting in Bosnia, which, like Afghanistan,
attracted Arab Muslim volunteers to what they regarded as a holy
war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was der of this group,'' a senior official
of the French police and judicial antiterrorism task force said in
Paris. ``We have material evidence he conducted this group from
Montreal. He moves around _ Bosnia, Syria, Turkey, Saudi Arabia,
Jordan.''
</P>
<P>
   Atmani, the other man sought by the French, had been deported
last year to Bosnia because he carried a Bosnian passport when he
arrived in Montreal as a stowaway on a cargo ship. His whereabouts
are unknown, although officials suspect he may have slipped back
into Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Montreal police arrested 11 men _ most of them
Algerians _ who they said had been stealing from the parked cars in
groups of two and three and extorting money from other Algerians.
The police said that part of the proceeds were going to fund the
Armed Islamic Group, an Algerian group that has carried out
massacres in villages there.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are financing organizations that train people to
assassinate fathers of families, pregnant women, old people and
children,'' said Jean-Yves Mailloux, head of the Montreal police
counterterrorism division.
</P>
<P>
   As the investigation accelerated, the police found a second
apartment where they believe Kamel, Atmani, Ressam and two others
spent several months together in 1998, in a separate municipality,
Ville d'Anjou. It is just east of Montreal, near the working-class
neighborhood where Ressam had been making preparations to open a
small grocery store with a license issued to his identity as Benni
Noris.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also believe they have identified the second man
who shared the cheap rooms at a motel in Vancouver with Rassem
before he made his unlucky ferry trip. He was said to be Abdul
Majid Dahoumane, an Algerian who applied for asylum here in 1995,
was refused, and, like Rassem, was under a deportation order.
</P>
<P>
   Police and intelligence officials say that Canada's generous
immigration policies have also meant that foreign terror groups can
more easily establish and maintain cells here.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service reported
that it had active investigations into 50 terrorist groups and 350
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's director, Ward Elcock, told the Canadian Senate's
security and intelligence commitee last year that terrorists have
been taking advantage of the system for years and that almost every
terrorist group in the world had a foothold in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrorist groups are present here whose origins lie in every
significant regional ethnic and nationalist conflict there is,'' he
said. ``The nature of our society and the related policies
concerning refugees and immigrants make us particularly vulnerable
to terrorist influence and activities.''
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence agency's Web site lists a wide variety of
terrorist groups operating within Canada, including Hezbollah,
Hamas, groups from Algeria and Iran, the Tamil Tigers of Sri Lanka,
the Irish Republican Army and ``all the major Sikh'' separatists.
It adds that more group are arriving, including the Kurdish
Worker's Party, ``trained assassins'' from the Palestinian Force
17, and the Iranian intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, Canada has deported only 11 people as terrorists.
Before that, none.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Canada's general welcome of immigrants, Rassem
was probably helped by official Quebec policy of trying to bring
more French-speaking immigrants into the province. Many Algerians
speak French as a legacy of French colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, 12,600 French-speaking immigrants were admitted. Next
year the number is expected to reach as high as 14,600.

FEDERAL OFFICIALS WARN OF SUSPICIOUS HOLIDAY PARCELS FROM GERMANY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
and STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
(Eds.: See optional trim) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alerted to the possibility of mail bombs from
Germany, federal officials began screening holiday parcels Thursday
and renewed warnings that terrorists _ both foreign and domestic _
might be targeting Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, two of the three people arrested recently at U.S.
border crossings have been linked to international terrorist
organizations in Algeria and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday, the Postal Inspection Service began X-ray
examinations of all parcels and first-class mail from Frankfurt,
Germany, after receiving a mail-bomb alert from the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued at 2 a.m. Thursday in Washington, the FBI
reported that ``unsubstantiated information'' had been received
saying ``that individuals may be planning to send bombs in small
parcels to addresses in the United States'' from Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   Except to say that airlines _ along with state and local
authorities _ were notified once the tips had been received, bureau
officials declined to provide any other details about the
information or its sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of an abundance of caution, the public is being promptly
alerted to this information,'' the FBI statement said.
``Questionable packages should not be handled and local authorities
should be notified.''
</P>
<P>
   Postal Inspector Dan Mihalko said anyone receiving an unexpected
parcel from Frankfurt should exercise caution, especially if there
is no return address. ``If you receive something that in your mind
is suspicious, something that you're not familiar with, don't open
it. Call the professionals _ the postal service and the police,''
Mihalko advised.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to screening packages at 11 U.S. facilities that
process mail received directly from Frankfurt, postal and aviation
officials are working with airlines to examine any mail over 16
ounces before it leaves Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to cover it at both ends,'' Mihalko said.
</P>
<P>
   Persistent threats of violence _ from international terrorists
and home-grown extremists _ have prompted officials to increase
security and heighten public awareness while walking a fine line to
avoid a panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that at the millennium, a lot of people who may even
be a little crazy by our standards, or may have a political point
to make, may try to take advantage of it,'' President Clinton said
late Thursday on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you see something that's suspicious, you should report it,
just to make sure that we do everything we possibly can to maximize
our protection,'' the president said. ``But I wouldn't just hunker
down until it was all over.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, security has been stepped up at airports, seaports
and the Post Office in the wake of warnings this week from
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking aggressive steps to use all the technology and
tactics that we have available,'' said John Babb, director of field
operations for the U.S. Customs Service's East Texas office.
</P>
<P>
   An extra 600 Customs agents have been assigned to ports of entry
around the country. In Houston, additional agents have been
assigned to Bush Intercontinental Airport, the Port of Houston and
to mail-processing centers.
</P>
<P>
   With Thursday's alert focusing on the Frankfurt area, Babb said,
``we're paying particular attention to (flights from) that part of
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett Johnson, assistant inspector in charge of the local
office of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, said most mail
arriving in Houston already has been screened, so his agents are
concentrating on the small number of parcels coming by foreign
airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for anything that might have missed the regular
routing process,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to warning about possible anti-American attacks by
foreign militants, U.S. officials have alerted local law
enforcement about evidence that domestic hate groups and religious
extremists are preparing for year-end violence.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI report in late October said members of militias and
racist groups, such as Aryan Nations, Christian Identity and
Odinism, have begun stockpiling weapons, food, clothing and money,
and have been surveying potential targets for attack.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a federal magistrate ordered a Canadian woman and
an Algerian national to be held without bond. The pair _ Lucia
Garofalo, 35, and Bouabide Chamchi, 20 _ were arrested Sunday at a
checkpoint as they tried to enter Vermont from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo is charged with trying to smuggle Chamchi into the
United States. Chamchi was charged with violating immigration rules
and possession of a false French passport.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents produced at a detention hearing in Burlington,
Vt., indicated that the car and cell phone used by Garofalo have
been traced to Brahim Mahdi, a member of the Algerian Islamic
League, a group of militants suspected of terrorist activities in
Europe and Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   During an inspection, Vermont border officials found a false
French passport in Chamchi's coat belonging to him. He denied any
knowledge of the passport. Garofalo, according to investigators,
said she had given the passport to Chamchi.
</P>
<P>
   Two explosives-sniffing dogs also detected possible traces of
explosives during an inspection of Garofalo's vehicle. No
explosives were found and authorities said subsequent tests turned
up nothing else to indicate explosives were carried in the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Mahdi, 34, denied any connection to terrorism and told The
Associated Press from his Montreal home that he had never heard of
the Algerian Islamic League.
</P>
<P>
   He said Garofalo was a friend and that he knew of no links
between her and terrorism. The car was registered in his name
because she has bad credit, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities stressed there was no evidence linking Garofalo or
Chamchi to another Algerian who was apprehended Dec. 14 in Port
Angeles, Wash, about 60 miles northwest of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Ressam, 32, has pleaded not guilty to charges of trying to
smuggle bomb ingredients and timing devices into the United States.
When he was arrested driving a rental car off a ferry from
Victoria, British Columbia, Ressam also allegedly was carrying two
false passports.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, The Associated Press reported that the Canadian
Security and Intelligence Service has told U.S. officials that
Ressam was trained in the early 1990s in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators in France, Canada and the United States are trying
to determine whether Ressam has any ties to the international
Islamic terrorist network blamed in last year's bombings of U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The group is headed by
anti-American Islamic militant Osama bin Laden, who is based in
Afghanistan and has issued a call for attacks against Americans
during the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Canada and the United States are continuing their
search for Abdel Majid Dahoumane, an Algerian who shared a
Vancouver hotel room with Ressam for three weeks before he tried to
enter the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported that French authorities had been
searching for Ressam and are still looking for his former roommate,
a dual Bosnian-Algerian national named Said Atmani, on suspicion of
links to a group of Islamic radicals who carried out attacks in
northern France.

SERB TELLS MILOSEVIC WAR WASN'T WORTH SON'S LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KRALJEVO, Yugoslavia _ Last week, eight months after his
20-year-old son was killed in Kosovo, Dusan Vukovic hit out at the
man he holds responsible: President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   When he was presented with a posthumous medal for his son,
Aleksandar, at a televised ceremony in his home town, Vukovic
refused to take it, and demanded that it be sent back to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them to take that medal and give it to Milosevic to
give to his son, because as far as I know, war decorations are
given to war heroes who are standing up,'' he said in an interview
Wednesday in this small town in southwestern Serbia. ``My son is
lying down and I cannot put it around his neck.''
</P>
<P>
   Vukovic's angry rejection to the medal was virtually the only
public protest since the end of the war by relatives of fallen
soldiers. But it touched a raw nerve and exposed a ground swell of
bitterness among ordinary families.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, Vukovic became a local hero. Several newspapers even
proposed that he be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. He says he has
received hundreds of telephone calls from people all over Serbia
and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `Thank you, you have done a good job to stop this,
to stop us losing our kids, and to show what people are
thinking,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the president of Montenegro, Serbia's sister republic
within Yugoslavia, sent a message commending him for his stance, he
said. As secretary of the local veterans' organization, Vukovic has
now become a rallying point for many Serbs who lost their relatives
in the war to suppress Kosovo Albanian separatists and who say they
will make similar protests.
</P>
<P>
   It was the scrap of cheap paper that was brought round to his
home last week that spurred Vukovic's protest. A standard military
form used to call up conscripts to military service, it is headed:
``The Fatherland Calls You.'' But this paper called him to a
reception at noon the following day to receive a ``decoration for
your dead son, Aleksandar.''
</P>
<P>
   To Vukovic, 49, a factory worker and organizer of the local
soccer fan club where his son played, this was an insult. ``Is it
appropriate to call the father of a son who died on toilet paper?''
he asked, holding up the flimsy brownish paper.
</P>
<P>
   It summed up everything that he was angry about: Milosevic's
politics, the indifference of the system and the senseless war that
took his son's life.
</P>
<P>
   Aleksandar died from bullet wounds in northern Kosovo on April
13, apparently shot by ethnic Albanian rebels of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, although his father is still awaiting the results
of the forensic analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Aleksandar had been in Kosovo just three days, sent in with the
rest of his tank unit from their base in Nis, in southern Serbia.
``He did not have time to see a gun, or to shoot anyone,'' Vukovic
said. ``He did not want to shoot anyone. A kid of 20 does not want
to be in a war.''
</P>
<P>
   Aleksandar telephoned his parents the night before he left for
Kosovo. ``He told us to take care of ourselves,'' his father
recalled. ``He said this guy will destroy us,'' a reference to
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always told us: `Do not vote for him because you will
destroy the kids,''' Vukovic went on.
</P>
<P>
   Some 7,000 people turned out for Aleksandar's funeral at the New
Cemetery on the edge of Kraljevo, two days after his death. The
family still visits the grave every day, whatever the weather,
sitting for hours on a nearby bench. ``My wife cries all the
time,'' Vukovic said.
</P>
<P>
   He brushed the snow from the grave, revealing the grass
underneath that he had laid to resemble a soccer field. A tall
black granite headstone bore a full-length picture of his son as a
young soccer player, his foot poised on the ball. On each side was
the grave of another young man, each also a victim of the war in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Milosevic came to power, Kraljevo has lost 75 sons in 10
years of wars,'' Vukovic said. More than half of them _ 41 men from
the town and its surrounding districts _ died in Kosovo, seven
apparently from NATO bombing and the rest in the conflict with the
Kosovo Liberation Army, he said. Some 95 men were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   So when Vukovic received the invitation to the ceremony for his
son, he made his plans. He prepared his speech and took along a
local television crew and an Agence France-Presse journalist,
Miroslav Filipovic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic's family is together at breakfast, lunch and dinner,
while my family has breakfast and dinner at my son's grave,'' he
told the colonel from the defense ministry who presented the medal.
</P>
<P>
   Then he criticized the army, which he said had failed to protect
his son and sent young, inadequately trained conscripts to war.
``They do not react in the right way to protect the youth of this
country,'' he recalled saying. ``They churn out these decorations
daily, but one decoration means nothing if you do not have your
boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I refused the medal because they did not call the other 40
families to participate in that farce of a decoration ceremony,''
he said. ``They will do it one by one, so that people do not see
how many here are wearing black.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Vukovic's speech in front of the military officer, who stood as
if turned to stone, was broadcast on local television and, in a
rare incidence of free viewing in Yugoslavia, was picked up by the
national television network and shown around the country.
</P>
<P>
   It was particularly striking for its criticism of Milosevic, who
is usually praised on the nightly news by loyal regional figures,
who repeatedly call for him to be awarded medals for his leadership
of the nation during the 11-week NATO bombing campaign to force
Serbian forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   It also reminded local residents of the tumultuous events in
June, when Serbian troops returned home from Kosovo, angry,
humiliated and disillusioned, and took up armed positions in the
town, aiming the weapons on their armored vehicles at the local
police headquarters. The standoff lasted several days and the
ringleaders were eventually arrested, but feelings in the town
clearly have not changed.
</P>
<P>
   Vukovic admits he is confused about the war in Kosovo. He has no
love for the Albanians and believes Kosovo should remain part of
Serbia. But he strikes a chord among all Serbs when he denounces
the government's attempt to resolve the issue by war.
</P>
<P>
   ``This war was pushed by Milosevic,'' he said. ``It was not the
will of Serbian or Albanian people. It all could have been agreed
in a democratic, humane way. No one has kids they can waste.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the snow by his son's grave, he said: ``When you ask
if he did not want to go to war, none of them did. All of them were
against this war.''

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton issued a pardon Thursday to
Freddie Meeks, one of the last survivors of the Port Chicago 50, a
group of black sailors whose convictions on mutiny charges during
World War II became a civil rights cause and helped spur
integration of the armed services.
</P>
<P>
   After a huge accidental explosion killed 320 men, sank two Navy
vessels and flattened the docks at Port Chicago north of San
Francisco in 1944, Meeks and 49 others refused to go back to their
jobs loading ammunition aboard ships.
</P>
<P>
   The 50 black stevedores believed that the dangers of their work
had been downplayed by the then-segregated Navy because the
enlisted members of the loading crews were all black. Meeks and
others asked for combat duty instead, but they were prosecuted for
mutiny, convicted, and jailed.
</P>
<P>
   Meeks, 80, who lives in Los Angeles and is in frail health after
suffering a stroke this fall, was informed of the pardon Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we had a good president and I figured he would do the
right thing, and he did the right thing,'' Meeks told the
Associated Press. ``I appreciate it very much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yes, he's happy,'' added his wife, Eleanor Meeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy, as recently as 1994, had refused to expunge the
convictions. William J. Perry, who was then defense secretary, told
Congress that ``sailors are required to obey the orders of their
superiors, even if those orders subject them to life-threatening
danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Loading ammunition onto ships was an essential part of the war
effort, the Navy said, and was no more dangerous than combat. Since
a Marine ordered to move forward to attack a machine-gun nest did
not have the right to question orders, the Navy argued, then
neither should an ammunition handler.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also gave presidential pardons to 36 other Americans
Thursday in a traditional Christmas-season practice, using a power
granted him by the Constitution. But Meeks was the only one of
three surviving mutineers to file an official request with the
White House, said Brian Busey, a Washington-based attorney who
represented Meeks at no charge.
</P>
<P>
   Because the servicemen were convicted and served time in prison
so long ago, the action Thursday was largely symbolic. Jack
Crittenden, another of the Port Chicago 50, declined to join Meeks
and told reporters that a pardon would be an empty gesture. A third
survivor, Busey said, is thought to be living in South Carolina and
did not petition the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The July 17, 1944, explosion of more than 3 million pounds of
ammunition obliterated Port Chicago, on the Sacramento River.
Windows were shattered in San Francisco, more than 30 miles away.
Most of the 320 men killed were black sailors who had been given no
special training in handling explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Though their white officers were given 30 days leave to recover
from the emotional toll of the disaster, the black enlisted men
were dispatched to the docks to collect the bodies and body parts
of the dead, Busey said.
</P>
<P>
   Scarred by the grisly duty and frightened by the destructive
power of the blast, more than 200 black seamen refused to go back
to work when ordered three weeks later to resume loading
ammunition. Three-fourths of them relented after the Navy
threatened to shoot them as mutineers, but 50 remained steadfast.
Instead of being charged with the lesser offense of disobeying
orders, they were court-martialed for mutiny, convicted by an
all-white panel, and sentenced to 15 years at hard labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us, `You know you could be shot.' But we made up our
mind _ you go back you might be blown to pieces _ so we didn't go
back,'' Meeks recalled. He served 18 months in prison before his
sentence was commuted in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   ``I firmly believe the prosecution and conviction was improper
and racially tinged . . . and replete with a lot of evidence this
would never have happened if they were white sailors,'' Busey said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The civil rights community agreed. Thurgood Marshall, a young
black counsel for the NAACP who would later serve on the US Supreme
Court, represented the seamen in their appeals process. Eleanor
Roosevelt interceded on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Chicago story was told last spring in an NBC-TV movie.
Led by Representative George Miller and Senator Barbara Boxer, both
Democrats from California, 35 members of Congress asked Clinton in
the fall to grant Weeks a pardon. The NAACP, at its convention last
summer, passed a resolution calling on Clinton to pardon the Port
Chicago survivors.

PACKAGES FROM GERMANY TO GET X-RAY TREATMENT, US SAYS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Responding to an FBI warning of a possible
terrorist threat, the US Postal Service will X-ray every package
and parcel arriving from Frankfurt to check for bombs, government
officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of an abundance of caution,'' the public is urged not to
open any parcel from Frankfurt if the sender is unknown or the
package is not expected, the FBI said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the FBI nor the Postal Service would discuss how the
threat of a mail bomb was discovered, who might be behind it, or
why the German city is believed to be the origin of a possible
threat.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI statement said the threat that ``individuals'' might
post a bomb to a US address were ``unsubstantiated.'' But
government officials _ even while urging Americans not to panic _
are on high alert following the recent arrests of several
suspicious people entering the country.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement fueled fears that a terrorist group might use
the occasion of the millennium to mount an attack against Americans
at home or abroad. Airport and border security already have been
tightened.
</P>
<P>
   As the nation's capital slows down for a holiday rest,
government agencies, ranging from the FBI to the Postal Service,
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the Federal Aviation
Administration, are in high gear, preparing for possible computer
glitches or a terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   But President Clinton and members of his administration appealed
for calm as well as caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice to the American people would be to go about their
business and do what they would intend to do at the holiday season,
but to be a little more aware of people and places,'' Clinton said
on ``Larry King Live'' on CNN Thursday night. ``If you have a hunch
about something, if you see something that's suspicious, you should
report it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were me, I would not . . . refrain from activities,''
the president said. ``I'm going to go out and do my Christmas
shopping. I wouldn't just hunker down until it was all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bethel, spokesman for the Postal Service's inspection
division, said parcels from Frankfurt would be X-rayed, but he
would not say what other protective measures would be taken because
he did not want to ``tip off'' potential terrorists. Mail from
Frankfurt comes into 10 airports around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that the American people not be traumatized
over this,'' Bethel said. ``We want people to be alert to this, but
we don't want any panicking.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``if you're not expecting anything from Frankfurt, bells
and whistles should go off,'' Bethel said, and the package should
be immediately turned over to the Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has issued a ``worldwide caution'' to
Americans, urging them to be on the lookout for trouble, especially
if they are in large groups.
</P>
<P>
   The department does not have any specific information on any
particular country or city where a potential attack is suspected,
Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   The White House-sponsored ``America's Millennium'' celebration,
expected to draw many thousands of people on The Mall, will go
ahead as scheduled, with both the president and Hillary Rodham
Clinton present.
</P>
<P>
   At no time did Clinton consider changing his New Year's plans or
staying out of the public crowd to protect himself from a possible
terrorist threat, said White House spokeswoman Nanda Chitre.
</P>
<P>
   The fear of a domestic attack was heightened Dec. 14 when an
Algerian man, Ahmed Ressam, was discovered entering Washington
state with bomb-making materials. Lucia Garofalo, one of two people
arrested earlier this week at the Vermont-Canadian border, has
connections to an international group that has allegedly sponsored
terrorist activities in Algeria and Europe, prosecutors charged
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on Algeria said they did not recognize the name of the
organization, the Algerian Islamic League. The league could be a
splinter group of a terrorist organization, the analysts said. It
is also possible that the name of the group was mistranslated, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   Algeria has been the site of terrorist and counter-terrorist
violence since the early 1990s, when the secular government,
unwilling to hand over power to the Islamic Salvation Front,
canceled the national election.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, a variety of Islamic groups, some of them engaged in
violence, have fought against the government. About 100,000
civilians have died in the struggle.
</P>
<P>
   The largest group, the Armed Islamic Group, or GIA for its
French language acronym, is considered a terrorist organization by
the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the group has attacked targets in Algeria and France.
France colonized Algeria, and Algerian Muslims perceive France to
be supportive of the secular Algerian government, said Gavin
Cameron, senior research associate at the Monterey Institute of
International Studies in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be surprised if the United States was a target,''
Cameron said, ``but the GIA, this year in particular, has become
much less predictable.''

CELTICS ACTIVATE FORTSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Behind closed doors at the Celtics' workout facility in
Waltham, the sight of Danny Fortson chasing after a loose ball
frightened general manager Chris Wallace. The 6-foot-7-inch,
260-pound forward was 20 feet away, but Wallace sprinted from his
courtside vantage point and out of harm's way. One player Wallace
did not want to collide with was Fortson.
</P>
<P>
   The memory of that preseason practice has stuck with Wallace the
last couple months. The moment reinforced the prediction that
Fortson would be an important part of the Celtics' 1999-2000
campaign. Wallace knew the forward's tenacity and toughness, not to
mention rebounding skill, would greatly benefit Boston. But the
general manager did not know it would be at least 25 games before
Fortson made a contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the Celtics activated Fortson from the injured list.
To make room on the roster, Jamel Thomas was placed on waivers.
Fortson hasn't played this season after suffering a stress fracture
in his right foot Oct. 20. With Paul Pierce still nursing a
sprained left ankle and a rigorous West Coast trip ahead, Fortson's
return comes at an important time for the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited because we've had a long wait,'' said
Wallace. ``When you make a deal such as the major one we did in the
offseason, you've got this guy penciled in to hopefully give you
consistent contributions. That's what you're looking for. You put
your roster up on the board and you have this guy there. But we've
not had him for 25 games. We really want to see what we've got
here. We think Danny will pay dividends.''
</P>
<P>
   The GM noted that Fortson was ``the key ingredient'' in Boston's
Augus with Denver. In exchange for Ron Mercer, Popeye Jones,
and Dwayne Schintzius, the Celtics received Fortson, Eric
Washington, Eric Williams, and a No. 1 draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   The impressive rebounding statistics Fortson accumulated during
his second year in the NBA attracted the Celtics. He averaged a
double-double (11.0 points and 11.6 rebounds per game) and ranked
fourth in the league in rebounding. He led his peers in rebounds
per 48 minutes (19.7) and offensive rebounds per game (4.2).
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been watching Danny play since high school,'' said
Wallace. ``He has never backed down to any challenge. He played in
what is considered a toughness/work-oriented program at the
University of Cincinnati. And in just his second season in the NBA,
he was way up on the charts in several different rebounding
categories. He doesn't have great size, in terms of his height. So
in order to be a great rebounder at that level, you have to have
some toughness. During pratice, he was a sight to behold sometimes.
Early on, he was just dominant, particularly on the offense boards
in our practice sessions.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace also lauds the rebounder's strength, knack for
positioning, and ability to get to the ball. What Fortson lacks in
height, he makes up with a wide body and rugged determination.
Wallace does not have a timetable of expectations for Fortson, and
coach Rick Pitino will keep it simple as the forward refamiliarizes
himself with plays in game situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't really know the plays as well as he should,'' said
Pitino. ``When he does play we will limit him to three or four
different things and not complicate things too much.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pitino fully expects Fortson to be prepared to rebound. Even
though the Celtics have performed reasonably well on the glass
without Fortson, Wallace knows that against teams with strong,
physical frontcourts, Boston can use a wide-bodied rebounder. In
its recent loss to the Lakers, where it was overmatched by
Shaquille O'Neal, a strong presence on the glass was missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got some real NBA-level characteristics and you're
willing to work hard and be unselfish, you can fit into any
system,'' said Wallace. ``And Danny will certainly be able to fit
into ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Thomas only spent 10 days with the team, he will
forever be part of Celtic lore. Late in the Celtics' 98-81 win over
Atlanta Wednesday, Thomas put home a fast-break dunk to register
the final basket ever scored on the parquet floor.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics already have one All-Star. Ed Lacerte, who is in his
13th season on the job, was selected to be trainer for the East
All-Star team for the annual game Feb. 13 in Oakland. Golden
State's Tom Abdenour will take care of the West squad.

SPORTS COLUMN: TED SHOULD JUST FIRE THE BIGOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BBN-ROCKER) 
(jt) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   That's the perverse part. John Rocker would feel right at home
in Shea and Yankee stadiums, beating up on opposing fans, shouting
all kinds of vile things, often with racial connotations.
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker is not alone. Other bullies and bigots lurk behind
microphones on talk radio, dropping shaded messages of ``us'' and
``them.'' Just flip the dial. The ``Beirut'' that Rocker mentioned
is a white code word for a neighborhood of color.
</P>
<P>
   Does anybody really think Rocker just made it up on the spot,
while aiming his expensive automobile at breakneck speed through
Atlanta's tangled roadways (and spitting into toll boxes)? It's not
steroids or greenies, nothing that simple. It's a deep-seated
hatred of the other.
</P>
<P>
   In this holiday season it is a rather sad chore to discuss the
bigotry incarnate in one relief pitcher, but John Rocker left us no
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker is a muscle-twitching, wide-eyed specimen who happens to
fling a baseball at high speed. He prattled to a Sports Illustrated
reporter this week that he hates a good deal of the populace of New
York, particularly anybody not exactly like him _ people with
purple hair, gays, unwed mothers, whatever. Most of all, he hates
foreigners, his definition most obviously including
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   New York, however, is only a convenient symbol for what really
bothers a lot of Americans about their country. When they say ``New
York,'' they really mean diverse, different, new. People who live
30 miles out of the city talk the same way, sometimes in the
ballpark. Rocker must also abhor much of the city in which (for the
moment) he earns his living. How barren would Atlanta be without
soul food at Son's, Indian food at Haveli's, Caribbean food at
Bridgetown and even the new Vietnamese pho shops? Rocker barrels
contemptuously past all of it, out beyond the 'burbs, to where he
feels in the majority again.
</P>
<P>
   His parents and his neighbors and officials from his private,
religion-based high school in Macon, Ga., are saying they are
saddened and shocked at his words. They say this is not the John
Rocker they know, but it stands to reason that Rocker did not just
pick up his bile from one ugly segment on talk radio. His prejudice
comes from deep in the heart of a national schism, people who think
the borders should have been closed the day after their own
ancestors arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker has since issued an apology whose coherence and maturity
make it impossible to have been written by him. The ghostwritten
mea culpa will not work. He said it, now he has to live with it.
</P>
<P>
   The community must also deal with him because he represents the
city every time he puts the cap with the A on his thick skull.
Atlanta is a city of careful good will, exemplified by Braves fans'
allowing Yankees fans to celebrate during the first two games of
the World Series. Official Atlanta, black and white, must back far
away from John Rocker and his vicious sense of disenfranchisement,
which is no small factor in rural America.
</P>
<P>
   There is some doubt whether baseball can do much with Rocker. It
suspended Marge Schott for praising Hitler, but she was an owner
whereas Rocker is just a lug with a fastball. There is probably
some ``conduct detrimental to baseball'' clause that even his union
(which defended Roberto Alomar when he spat at an umpire) cannot
totally ignore.
</P>
<P>
   So baseball may fine Rocker a few thousand and may suspend him
for a few games, but he must still dress in a room with decent
people named Maddux and Smoltz and Jordan and Lopez. The black and
Hispanic players must know how he really feels about them. They
don't check their instincts at the clubhouse door.
</P>
<P>
   If the players took a vote, they'd probably opt for firing him
right now. Rocker throws hard, but he admits he is not exactly into
the subtlety of the game. Now he could get any of his teammates
skulled at any moment from the psychological assassins already
present in New York grandstands.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Turner has built his CNN empire on a quirky message of
universal brotherhood. He was reaching out to the Soviet Union and
preaching environmentalism early in the '80s. More than any other
owner in sports, Turner has the moxie to just fire this rube.
(Besides, some team will pick Rocker up. Pitching is pitching.)
Turner should do it right away, as a gesture to peace on earth, a
gesture that bigotry is bad form in every season, particularly the
holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   Then the rest of us can examine our radios, our televisions, our
papers, our Internet sites, our companions, our souls, and ask if
John Rocker acted alone.

<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Tuesday, Dec. 21,
about Bruce Teitelbaum, an adviser to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani who
has been under scrutiny for his role in dealing with Hasidic
builders in Brooklyn, misstated an account from Brooklyn
prosecutors about their interviewing of Anthony V. Carbonetti,
Giuliani's chief of staff. According to prosecutors, Carbonetti
spoke with investigators once in person and later by telephone. But
they say the telephone conversation was initiated by the Brooklyn
District Attorney's office, not by Carbonetti.

NEW DETAILS EMERGE IN CASE OF CHILD WHO TOLD TEACHER MOTHER DIED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARCELLA BOMBARDIERI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEABODY, Mass. _ The School Committee said Thursday the staff at
the Kiley School acted properly after seven-year-old Lydia Hanson
came to school saying her mother had died.
</P>
<P>
   ``The staff acted in a manner that was appropriate under the
circumstances,'' the committee concluded in a unanimous vote taken
Monday and released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Written testimony from a teacher and a guidance counselor,
obtained by the Salem Evening News, painted a first-hand portrait
of what happened, contradicting some details previously offered by
family members and school officials.
</P>
<P>
   The panel was investigating why the teacher and the guidance
counselor allowed Lydia to take the school bus home, where she
spent a night in the arms of her mother's dead body.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to some previous reports, Lydia's teacher, 57-year-old
Janet Makar, said in her testimony that she never asked Lydia if
her mother was in fact dead.
</P>
<P>
   Makar's statement describes the events of Dec. 9 beginning at
8:35 a.m., when her first-graders lined up outside to enter the
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of children came to me and said, `Mrs. Makar, Lydia
said her mother died,' '' Maker wrote in her statement. ``I
approached Lydia and said, `We don't say things like that,' ''
wrote Makar, a teacher of 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   A school department source previously said Makar had asked Lydia
why she told her classmates her mother was dead. The source said
the girl had not responded, after which Makar raised the matter
with a guidance counselor.
</P>
<P>
   Lydia's mother Kimberly Hanson, 33, had died that day,
apparently of an enlarged heart. Hanson, a single parent, was
diabetic and, at 5 feet 10 inches, weighed about 200 pounds because
of her illness, said Lydia's grandmother, Sharon Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker blamed Makar for chastising Lydia, whom she called a
``timid and shy'' child. Had the teacher been gentler, Tucker said,
perhaps she would have discovered the truth, sparing Lydia the
trauma of a solitary night with her dead mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Lydia is approached by an adult and they're talking firmly,
she'll shut down. She won't talk,'' Tucker said. ``The teacher had
her in class since September. She should know how she is.''
</P>
<P>
   In her testimony, Makar descr otherwise normal day. The
first-graders, she wrote, completed math assignments, a vocabulary
drill and group reading. Makar ``introduced the letter `Y.' '' The
children ate snack and lunch and played at recess.
</P>
<P>
   Lydia ``didn't cry. She didn't daydream or look spacey. She did
her work and showed no frustration,'' wrote Makar.
</P>
<P>
   When Makar consulted a guidance counselor, Jennifer Colt, about
the girl's odd remarks about her mother, Makar suggested ``maybe
they could have had an argument that morning about something like
what to wear,'' according to Colt's statement.
</P>
<P>
   After Makar described Lydia's ordinary demeanor, Colt asked,
``What do you think?'' Makar wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I don't know,' and I used body language and shrugged
my shoulder,'' wrote Makar.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher and the guidance counselor apparently satisfied
themselves that nothing was seriously amiss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finished my conversation with Mrs. Makar, deciding that
according to her observations, that she had appropriately
intervened and monitored the child,'' Colt said. ``The statements
that she made led me to believe that this child was fine. She did
not request that I speak with the child, nor did she relate to me
the need for further follow-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Lydia's grandmother expressed frustration that two staff members
never questioned Lydia directly or attempted to contact her mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``They worked backwards on this,'' Tucker said. ``They took the
time to monitor her all day and they didn't take the time to pick
up the phone and call the police _ even the Peabody Police said
that's what they're there for.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Mayor Peter Torigian, who chairs the school committee,
said ``hindsight is 20/20.''
</P>
<P>
   `You're in the midst of a hectic day with 450 students in a
school, and some things can slip through the cracks,'' Torigian
said. ``I don't call it a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Adults unfamiliar with young children have no idea how tough a
job teachers have deciphering the truth behind what kids say, said
Kerry Costello, a psychologist in the Andover public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come out with some outrageous stories,'' Costello said.
``If you believed everything you heard in the course of a day with
little kids, you'd never get any teaching done.''
</P>
<P>
   Although first-graders rarely say their parents have died, they
may imagine the deaths of pets or grandparents they see
infrequently, said Costello.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can go on and on. You ask, `Is it really true your dog died
last night?' And it turns out they don't even have a dog,'' she
said. ``You're always walking a fine line.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, said Maryellen Cunnion, assistant professor of education
at Simmons College, such a serious statement is worth checking out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a worrisome thing for a child to say something like
that,'' Cunnion said. ``I don't want to second-guess this woman,
but I'd err on the side of caution. At least pursue it with a phone
call home.''

TERROR SUSPECT LIVED OUTSIDE OF BOSTON

<P>
   BOSTON _ Boston's most solid link to world terrorism to emerge
in the jittery days before the dawn of a new millenium was known to
his neighbors as a taxi driver with regular visitors who drove with
Quebec plates.
</P>
<P>
   Raed Hajazi is one of three people still at large from a
terrorist ring tied to Osama bin Laden that allegedly plotted the
bombing of Christian holy sites in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen other alleged members of the ring were arrested last
week in Jordan, but Hajazi escaped. He has not been linked by law
enforcement officials to any of the other Middle Easterners who
have recently been apprehended in Canadian border crossings on
suspicion of terrorist links.
</P>
<P>
   Althought Hajazi hasn't lived in suburban Everett in two years,
he still has a valid Massachusetts driving license. The FBI's
counter-terrorism squad has been on alert for any sign he has
returned, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents went door to door in Hajazi's old neighorhood two
weeks ago, showing residents a photo of the suspected terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Li said he recognized Hajazi as his downstairs neighbor
in a two-family house, where the taxi driver lived with two younger
men Li thought might have been students. More than a year ago, all
three men moved out and left no forwarding address, Li said.
</P>
<P>
   Hajazi's driving license lists a birthdate that would make him
21-years-old. But Li said he thought Hajazi was as much as a decade
older than that.
</P>
<P>
   It was the bombing scheme Hajazi is linked to that prompted US
officials to issue warnings to all Americans traveling abroad over
the holidays to possible terrorist attacks. Security at airports
and other travel points has been tightened in the wake of those
warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanian security forces arrested 11 Jordanian nationals, an
Iraqi and an Algerian who are suspected of planning terrorist
attacks in the Hashemite kingdom. Jordanian authorities said the
ring was funded by Omar Abu Omar, known as a close associate of bin
Laden.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Everett neighborhood where Hajazi rented an apartment
two years ago, he hardly cast a shadow.
</P>
<P>
   Li's wife, Be Trin, said she vaguely remembers seeing Hajazi
around their Appleton Street two-family. But she remembers the note
FBI agents left on their door two weeks ago _ before the arrests in
Jordan.

<P>
   President Clinton pardoned an 80-year-old former sailor
Thursday, forgiving a World War II conviction for mutiny that had
become a reminder of the history of segregation in the armed
services.
</P>
<P>
   The former serviceman, Freddie Meeks, is one of the few
survivors of a group of 50 black sailors who were convicted of
mutiny because they refused to resume loading ammunition onto ships
at a California port after an explosion there killed 320 men on
July 17, 1944. Most of those who died were members of black work
crews, and the 50 who refused to resume the loading said blacks had
been forced to do dangerous and menial tasks by white officers who
ignored the risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson is we stood up for our rights,'' Meeks said
Thursday at his Los Angeles home after learning of the pardon. ``We
stood up to get the same rights the whites had. We all should have
been treated the same, because we were all in the Navy and were
going to fight for the same purpose. But they thought we should do
the dirty work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Christmastime pardon was among 37 that Clinton granted
Thursday. But none of the others proceeded fromng nearly so
sweeping as the role that the mutiny at Port Chicago, just north of
San Francisco, played in American race history.
</P>
<P>
   More than half a century ago the story of the Port Chicago
explosion and the subsequent refusal of the 50 black sailors to
follow orders became one inspiration for a civil rights movement
just beginning to stir. Big-city black newspapers in particular
closely followed the 50 as they were court-martialed, found guilty
of mutiny by an all-white panel and imprisoned. Long before he
became a Supreme Court justice, Thurgood Marshall handled an
unsuccessful appeal of the convictions.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Chicago incident and the focus it beamed on segregation
in the Navy, some historians say, influenced President Harry S.
Truman's order formally desegregating the military in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless Meeks' application for a pardon presented a
difficult choice for Clinton, because the federal government had
been divided over the case in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   At a memorial it opened at the site of the explosion in 1994,
the National Park Service distributes literature describing the
risks faced by the black sailors. One brochure acknowledges that
for many Americans, the events at Port Chicago ``became a symbol of
what was wrong with American society.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the Navy reviewed the case in 1994, it declined to
expunge the convictions. ``Sailors are required to obey the orders
of their superiors,'' said William Perry, then secretary of
defense, ``even if those orders subject them to life-threatening
danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeks, a seaman 2nd class, was sentenced to 15 years in prison.
But, like many of the others, he was released after serving 17
months. The men then rejoined regular Navy units and, except for
those who committed later offenses, were eventually discharged
``under honorable conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the decades, the story of the Port Chicago incident faded
in memories. And some of the men, like Meeks, said they did nothing
to draw attention to what they felt was the shame of having been
branded mutineers.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the 1980s the Port Chicago story was rediscovered.
Scholars and journalists sought out sthe aging sailors. The
National Park Service began work on a memorial to the 320 men
killed in the explosion. Of those, 202 were black. This March a
television movie told the story of the Port Chicago sailors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 Congress directed the Pentagon to review the case. But
the Navy concluded ``the convictions were not tainted by racial
prejudice'' and declined to expunge the convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Port Chicago sailors were dead by the time the law
firm of Morrison &AMP; Foerster filed a petition seeking a pardon for
Meeks last June. The lawyers said Meeks was the only one of perhaps
three surviving Port Chicago sailor who wanted to ask for a pardon.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers read through old files on the case, including the
testimony of the 50 convicted mutineers.
</P>
<P>
   Working in what Meeks said was an effort to clear the historical
record, the lawyers retold the Port Chicago story in their petition
seeking the pardon. They described the black sailors' accounts of
handling tons of explosives in tight quarters with little training.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers of 1999 recounted the 55-year old testimony of the
sailors. ``I am willing to be governed by the laws of the Navy and
do anything to help my country win this war,'' Meeks had testified
in 1944. ``I will go to the front if necessary, but I am afraid to
load ammunition.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he said the pardon would be important for young
blacks who are going into the military because it showed Clinton
was interested in correcting the record of segregation.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Although he has been suffering from severe health problems in
recent years, Meeks said he had believed he would live long enough
to enjoy the symbolic victory of the pardon. ``I knew God was
keeping me around for something to see,'' he said. ``But I am just
sorry so many of the others are not around to see it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meeks added that he was focusing, on a victory that, while
mostly symbolic, was sweet.
</P>
<P>
   The pardon was issued in his name alone. But he seemed to want
to share it with 49 other men. ``It makes a big difference to know
the president gave us a pardon,'' he said. ``We've been waiting a
long time.''

HIGH-TECH BORDER SURVEILLANCE URGED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL CROWLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The recent arrests of three suspected terrorists at the
Vermont-Canada border show the need for a computerized system that
would track foreigners moving through the United States, say
supporters of such a program.
</P>
<P>
   The system, opposed by much of the New England congressional
delegation, would require border officials to check documents of
all non-residents entering and leaving the United States, and
create a new computerized system to track foreigners traveling
through the country.
</P>
<P>
   Authorized by a measure passed by Congress in 1996, the system
was scheduled to be up and running this October. But intense
opposition from border state congressmen, including Vermont Senator
Patrick Leahy and New Hampshire Senator Judd Gregg, has delayed the
plans until March 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the measure say it would tighten US borders
against drug traffickers and the growing threat of terrorism. They
argue the recent border arrests, which have heightened terrorism
fears around the country, underscore the need for better monitoring
of who is entering and leaving the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best wake-up call we're going to get,'' said Allen
Kay, a spokesman for Republican Representative Lamar Smith of
Texas, the measure's chief proponent.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, border agents in Vermont arrested an Algerian man and
a Canadian woman, both believed to have ties to terrorist groups,
as they were entering the United States. Last week, agents arrested
another Algerian man who entered Washington state with a load of
bomb-making materials in his car.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the suspects, Kay said: ``We don't know if they
have entered the US before. How any times have they entered? When
did they leave previously? That kind of information is invaluable
to investigators and to prosecutors and is a significant deterrent.
Right now we don't have any of those tools.''
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of the measure _ known as ``Section 110,'' its
location within a broad 1996 immigration law _ argue the measure
will cause massive disruptions in trade and tourism, including huge
traffic jams at the border. The White House and the US Chamber of
Commerce have said they oppose the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents also say the measure was designed to help ensure
foreigners do not overstay their visas in the United States and
would do little to deter terrorists or drug traffickers. The text
of the law, they note, clearly focuses on tracking immigrants with
visas and identifying those ``who remain in the United States
beyond the period authorized by the attorney general.''

ANALYSIS: FOR CREW AND GIULIANI, THE DIVORCE IS FINAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also NY-CREW-EDUC) 
(sw) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As recently as last week, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was
grudgingly content to leave the fate of his former friend, Schools
Chancellor Rudy Crew, in the hands of the seven members of the
city's Board of Education. After all, the mayor is on the verge of
declaring his candidacy for the Senate. He needs stability, not
complication.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent days, people close to the issue say, Giuliani
became fed up with the long-playing Rudy Crew psychodrama, and let
it be known that the chancellor's ouster would make a fine
Christmas present. The telling detail behind the mayor's decision
came when his two appointees to the board and a third ally suddenly
called for an emergency meeting to discuss the vexing matter of
whether to extend Crew's contract.
</P>
<P>
   So there was little need to hold one's breath when school board
members emerged from a closed-door meeting on Thursday afternoon.
By a 4-3 vote, Crew had essentially been fired. And the Giuliani
administration had spoken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt that the outcome of this vote occurred because
this was precisely what the mayor wanted,'' said Steven Sanders,
chairman of the State Assembly's Education Committee and a
Manhattan Democrat. ``At this point it is ridiculous to assert that
the mayor does not control the Board of Education. He always did.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials declined public comment on the end of
Crew's tenure. As for Giuliani, he was coy in the hours before the
vote, acknowledging that he had been talking ``for some time'' with
board members, and sidestepping a question about the chancellor's
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement after the vote, he was a tad more generous. ``In
light of all of the facts I believe the board made the right
decision,'' he said, adding, ``Rudy Crew did a good job in a system
that is not accountable or properly organized, and needs to be
thoroughly reformed.''
</P>
<P>
   Then on Thursday night, in an impromptu discussion with
reporters in City Hall, the mayor said that he talked with the four
members who eventually voted to end Crew's contract, and that they
had already made up their minds. When told that school board
chairman William Thompson said that the mayor's fingerprints were
all over the ouster, Giuliani joked, ``I'll have to check my
fingers.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the complex emotions that have surrounded the
Crew-Giuliani relationship, the mayor might as welsaid:
``The divorce is final.''
</P>
<P>
   After orchestrating the removal of Ramon Cortines as chancellor
in 1995, Giuliani endorsed Crew, an educator from Washington state,
as just the person to rein in a massive, out-of-control school
system. Before long, the two men had become confidants who
discussed personal matters as easily as they did matters of
education. Their friendship surprised acquaintances, given
Giuliani's brusqueness and Crew's acute sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   But a series of misunderstandings, miscommunications and basic
philosophical disagreements led to a very public unraveling of that
friendship over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   It began when Crew publicly threatened to resign if the mayor
successfully lobbied the school board to begin a pilot program for
school vouchers, in which tax money would be used to send
disadvantaged students to private schools. The mayor thought Crew
had gone from A to Z too quickly; the chancellor thought the mayor
was playing politics at his expense.
</P>
<P>
   From then on, every action prompted a reaction that smacked of
hurt and distrust. The mayor suggested that the school system
should be blown up; the chancellor responded with a letter to city
leaders and educators that criticized the mayor's ``unfortunate
remarks'' as ``destructive rhetoric.'' The mayor's allies on the
board rejected the chancellor's capital budget package; the
chancellor was photographed laughing it up with Hillary Rodham
Clinton, the mayor's expected opponent in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   For a few months the dispute disappeared amid the daily travails
of City Hall. But it resurfaced this fall when the school board had
to decide whether to renew Crew's contract by the end of the year.
And the misunderstandings continued.
</P>
<P>
   One person close to the administration said that two weeks ago
the mayor had effectively signed off on a deal in which Crew would
get a one-year contract extension, which a majority of the school
board was leaning toward approving.
</P>
<P>
   But then, in the mayor's estimation, Crew acquitted himself
poorly on several occasions _ from suddenly pushing for a
multi-year contract to ridiculing a critic on the City Council as
``too short'' to pass judgment on his performance. And there
remained lingering questions about the chancellor's desire to
remain in New York; he had a standing job offer in Seattle, where
his children from a former marriage live.
</P>
<P>
   Now, critics will likely argue that a mayor powerful enough to
remove a chancellor must accept some responsibility for a school
system that seems to have more success in garnering headlines for
scandal than in raising the reading and math scores of its
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows he's going to take a political hit,'' an adviser to
Giuliani said, ``but in the long run it's good for the school
system because Crew doesn't want to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   By late Thursday afternoon, the political martyrdom of Crew had
begun. City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone and Public Advocate
Mark Green, Democrats both, decried the school board's actions.
Then came a prepared statement by Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's
spokesman, e-mailed to reporters throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today Dr. Crew learned what happens when you disagree with
Rudy Giuliani,'' Wolfson said. ``Rudy Crew stood up to the mayor by
opposing his voucher scheme and paid the price. He deserved
better.''

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has denied that he would ask the
government to reimburse him for legal fees arising out of inquiries
by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel who investigated the
Whitewater land deals and the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Larry King of CNN, recorded on Wednesday
and broadcast Thursday night, Clinton said an article last week in
The Washington Post that said he was strongly leaning toward
seeking reimbursement ``is not true.'' He said he believed that the
article had been ``leaked from the independent counsel's office.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Independent Counsel Act, individuals who are targets
of investigations but who are not indicted may apply to the federal
court here for reimbursement of legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he believed ``I may be entitled to it, but my
instinct is not to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had been fortunate: ``I've had this legal defense
fund. People have helped me pay for my legal fees.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense fund is known to have raised more than $6 million.
The Clintons' legal bills are believed to total well over $10
million, though about half that amount has already been paid.

PROSECUTORS CITE WOMAN'S LINK TO ALGERIAN TERRORISTS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGTON, Vt. _ The Canadian woman arrested Sunday at a
Vermont border crossing is linked to a radical Algerian group
believed to ship arms to terrorist groups, prosecutors told a
federal judge Thursday at a detention hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The government's allegation that Lucia Garofalo, 35, of
Montreal, is connected to a key member of the Algerian Islamic
League heightened concerns that Garofalo and Algerian extremists
based in Canada might have transported explosives into the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo was ordered held until Dec. 30 so investigators can
pursue other leads that might tie her to international terrorist
organizations. She and Buoabide Chamchi, an Algerian national
arrested with her, so far have been charged only with immigration
and passport violations.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors said that the car Garofalo was driving was
registered to Brahim Mahdi, an Algerian national living in Canada
whom prosecutors identified as a ``primary member'' of the Algerian
Islamic League. In addition, they said, Mahdi bought the cell phone
she was using.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the Algerian Islamic League, Mourad Dhina, is
connected to groups that have committed terrorist acts in Europe
and Algeria, according to Assistant US Attorney Tristram J. Coffin.
</P>
<P>
   Dhina, a physicist who now lives in Switzerland, is reported to
be an international arms dealer ``actively involved in the shipment
of arms to terrorist organizations,'' Coffin told US Magistrate
Judge Jerome J. Neidermeier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Particularly troubling is the connection between the
defendants and persons affiliated with known Algerian extremist or
terrorist organizations and sympathizers,'' US Attorney Charles R.
Tetzlaff told the judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the possible ramifications for national security,
this is far from an ordinary detention case.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamchi was ordered detained until a probable cause hearing Jan.
6. Niedermeier ruled that Chamchi, 20, who has been living in
Canada under temporary refugee status, poses too great a risk of
flight.
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo, who officials said listed $8 in assets but travels
extensively in Europe and the Middle East, told US Customs
officials on recent attempts to enter the United States that she
was traveling to Boston. Tetzlaff declined to say what efforts
investigators are making to track Garofalo's connections in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public can rest assured that the government is
investigating this case in a very thorough and extensive manner,''
Tetzlaff said.
</P>
<P>
   But Garofalo's court-appointed attorney, Maryanne Campmann, said
the case appeared to be ``ethnic profiling,'' based on her client's
statement that she has an Algerian husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that much of this case is based on assumptions and
innuendo,'' Campmann said.
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo's arrest followed a series of attempted border
crossings.
</P>
<P>
   She successfully entered the United States, with two men that
officials described as ``Middle Eastern'' in appearance, on Dec. 6
at Pittsburg, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   At the remote crossing, controlled by only a camera and two-way
speaker at the time, Garofalo said she was heading to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   She returned to Canada through Stanstead, Quebec, on Dec. 12,
this time with a self-described Algerian national and another
person identified as her son. On Dec. 15, once again using the same
car, she retreated from the US border at Pittsburg, after guards
instructed her through a loudspeaker to report to an inspection
station. A Pakistani-born Canadian traveling with her said he did
not have identification papers.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Chamchi produced an apparently altered French
passport when he and Garofalo were stopped at the remote border
crossing in Beecher Falls, Vt. The pair said they had accidentally
entered Vermont while seeking a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   After questions were raised about the passport and the
circuitous route that the pair had taken from Montreal, two dogs
trained in explosives detection alerted officials to the right rear
panel of the 2000 model Neon that Garofalo was driving.
</P>
<P>
   FBI analysis of the substances found there did not yield any
evidence of explosives or ``explosive precursors,'' Coffin said. A
test for nitrates, often used in explosives, has not been
completed, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities previously had said that trace amounts of explosives
might have been found in the car. Tetzlaff declined Thursday to
identify the substances sent to the FBI lab in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Chamchi, who has been arrested at least twice in Canada for
stealing and breaking into motor vehicles, is said by Canadian
intelligence sources to be linked to Algerian radicals living in
Montreal who help finance terrorist acts through crime.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Ressam, the Algerian arrested in Washington state last
week with bomb-making material in his car, also lived in Montreal
and had ties to the criminal group, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors said their evidence indicates the case might
be much more than smuggling illegal immigrants across the border.
Neidermeier said the case ``is either a run-of-the-mill
alien-smuggling case or something more serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Coffin said the account on the cell phone Garofalo was using was
activated by Mahdi on July 29 and, four days later, transferred to
Garofalo. Preliminary analysis shows many international calls,
including countries in the Middle East and Canada, the attorney
said.
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo's husband, Yasim Rachek, is an Algerian national
deported from Canada in 1993 for using a fake French passport.
Rachek, now living in Italy, was arrested in London in 1996 for
using a fake Greek passport with a substituted picture, Coffin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo, a Canadian native who receives welfare and has three
children, has in-laws residing in Algeria from a previous marriage,
her attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   US investigators are working with Canadian authorities to
determine if Garofalo is linked to a 1992 theft and sale of
dynamite in Ontario. A phone number connected to Garofalo was
called several times in January 1992 from a telephone used by a
person being investigated in the heist.
</P>
<P>
   US attorneys produced little background on Chamchi. Coffin said
Canadian immigration officials reported that he entered that
country in June 1997 as a stowaway, contradicting Chamchi's
assertions that he had been living in Canada for 3 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
   Chamchi told US law enforcement officials that he worked full
time, Coffin said, but he could not remember the name of the
company. A default warrant for his arrest is outstanding in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   If a link to Dhina, the director of the Algerian Islamic League,
can be shown, the possibility of a terrorist conspiracy would be
heightened. Dhina, who has worked for the European Center of
Nuclear Research, fled his native Algeria for Europe a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dhina, also known as Sheik Ahmar, is believed to have been the
main go-between in Europe for Kamareddine Kerbane, the coordinator
of the Islamic fundamentalists' foreign networks. Dhina fled France
for Switzerland in 1995 after police raided his home.
</P>
<P>
   Dhina is believed to have provided much of the equipment
deployed in a car-bomb campaign in Algeria in 1994. He also has
made extensive use of the Internet and other modern computer
technology in his arms-purchasing efforts, according to Swiss media
reports.

 &HT;    Deal with Padres simmered until done
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A watched phone never rings. Out in San Diego, Kevin
Towers watched anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw Gerald Williams was going to Tampa Bay and
(Fernando) Vina going to St. Louis, I had a feeling the phone would
ring,'' the Padres' general manager said.
</P>
<P>
   Which it soon did. One call led to one of the biggest trades of
the winter. Because Braves GM John Schuerholz had explored the
possibilities of a similar deal with Towers just the week before
during the winter meetings, barely 48 hours passed between the
free-agent exodus of Williams and the six-man trade the Braves
formalized Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In giving up second baseman Bret Boone and left fielder-first
baseman Ryan Klesko, the Braves became a predominantly right-handed
hitting team with less power. In gaining second baseman Quilvio
Veras, outfielder Reggie Sanders and first baseman Wally Joyner,
the seven-time division champions emerged a more resourceful
offensive team. It could be their best defensive team. It is surely
a different team from what went before, in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think our run-creation and run-production capability is
better,'' Schuerholz said. ``Our team is going to be speedier, a
little more athletic.''
</P>
<P>
   The offensive impact should be felt immediately. On-base
percentages recorded by the Braves' leadoff (.318) and No. 2
hitters (.312) both ranked 15th among 16 National League teams last
season. The switch-hitting Veras ran up a .377 on-base average in
1999 (sixth among NL leadoff hitters), while the right-handed
hitting Sanders, appearing primarily third in the Padres' order,
scored a career-high 92 runs, tied a career-high with 36 steals and
recorded his second-best year in eight full major-league seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Both players have their downsides. Sanders, dealt to his third
team within 10 months, was almost run out of Cincinnati in 1998
after a steadily declining performance. Veras' durability has been
questioned through his five-year career, and he lately developed an
overly deliberate throwing habit that alarmed the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   ``One guy's got a Gold Glove and, not to knock Quilvio, but he
doesn't have those merits and honors,'' Towers said. ``Bret's got
more range left and right.''
</P>
<P>
   But Williams' defection as the club's only viable leadoff man
forced Schuerholz's hand. And if the Braves needed a final push, it
came from incoming batting coach Merv Rettenmund, who spent his
past nine seasons in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very, very strong on the acquisition of these three
guys,'' Schuerholz said. ``He especially likes the job Sanders and
Veras did. And of course, Wally Joyner played with a broken
shoulder for most of last year.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Joyner is the most intriguing aspect of the deal.
Limited to just 110 games and 323 at-bats by a fractured left
shoulder, Joyner's production (.248-5-43) was the lowest of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Joyner turns 38 on June 16, the Braves still regard
him as one of the league's reigning clutch hitters. Over the five
seasons before 1999, Joyner hit .344 with runners in scoring
position. Even during his MVP campaign last summer, Chipper Jones
managed just .308 in those situations.
</P>
<P>
   If Andres Galarraga is not prepared for full-time service,
Joyner becomes the left-handed bat for the middle of the order. If
Galarraga can resume his place at first, Joyner becomes a critical
late-inning reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a part-time player and sharing time with Andres,''
Joyner said, ``might be the best for both of us.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton pardoned an 80-year-old former sailor
Thursday, forgiving a World War II conviction for mutiny that had
become a reminder of the history of segregation in the armed
services.
</P>
<P>
   The former serviceman, Freddie Meeks, is one of the few
survivors of a group of 50 black sailors who were convicted of
mutiny because they refused to resume loading ammunition onto ships
at a California port after an explosion there killed 320 men on
July 17, 1944. Most of those who died were members of black work
crews, and the 50 who refused to resume the loading said blacks had
been forced to do dangerous and menial tasks by white officers who
ignored the risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson is we stood up for our rights,'' Meeks said
Thursday at his Los Angeles home after learning of the pardon. ``We
stood up to get the same rights the whites had. We all should have
been treated the same, because we were all in the Navy and were
going to fight for the same purpose. But they thought we should do
the dirty work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Christmastime pardon was among 37 that Clinton granted
Thursday. But none of the others proceeded from anything nearly so
sweeping as the role that the mutiny at Port Chicago, just north of
San Francisco, played in American race history.
</P>
<P>
   More than half a century ago the story of the Port Chicago
explosion and the subsequent refusal of the 50 black sailors to
follow orders became one inspiration for a civil rights movement
just beginning to stir. Big-city black newspapers in particular
closely followed the 50 as they were court-martialed, found guilty
of mutiny by an all-white panel and imprisoned. Long before he
became a Supreme Court justice, Thurgood Marshall handled an
unsuccessful appeal of the convictions.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Chicago incident and the focus it beamed on segregation
in the Navy, some historians say, influenced President Harry S.
Truman's order formally desegregating the military in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless Meeks' application for a pardon presented a
difficult choice for Clinton, because the federal government had
been divided over the case in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   At a memorial it opened at the site of the explosion in 1994,
the National Park Service distributes literature describing the
risks faced by the black sailors. One brochure acknowledges that
for many Americans, the events at Port Chicago ``became a symbol of
what was wrong with American society.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the Navy reviewed the case in 1994, it declined to
expunge the convictions. ``Sailors are required to obey the orders
of their superiors,'' said William Perry, then secretary of
defense, ``even if those orders subject them to life-threatening
danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeks, a seaman 2nd class, was sentenced to 15 years in prison.
But, like many of the others, he was released after serving 17
months. The men then rejoined regular Navy units and, except for
those who committed later offenses, were eventually discharged
``under honorable conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the decades, the story of the Port Chicago incident faded
in memories. And some of the men, like Meeks, said they did nothing
to draw attention to what they felt was the shame of having been
branded mutineers.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the 1980s the Port Chicago story was rediscovered.
Scholars and journalists sought out some of the aging sailors. The
National Park Service began work on a memorial to the 320 men
killed in the explosion. Of those, 202 were black. This March a
television movie told the story of the Port Chicago sailors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 Congress directed the Pentagon to review the case. But
the Navy concluded ``the convictions were not tainted by racial
prejudice'' and declined to expunge the convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Port Chicago sailors were dead by the time the law
firm of Morrison &AMP; Foerster filed a petition seeking a pardon for
Meeks last June. The lawyers said Meeks was the only one of perhaps
three surviving Port Chicago sailor who wanted to ask for a pardon.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers read through old files on the case, including the
testimony of the 50 convicted mutineers.
</P>
<P>
   Working in what Meeks said was an effort to clear the historical
record, the lawyers retold the Port Chicago story in their petition
seeking the pardon. They described the black sailors' accounts of
handling tons of explosives in tight quarters with little training.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers of 1999 recounted the 55-year old testimony of the
sailors. ``I am willing to be governed by the laws of the Navy and
do anything to help my country win this war,'' Meeks had testified
in 1944. ``I will go to the front if necessary, but I am afraid to
load ammunition.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, he said the pardon would be important for young
blacks who are going into the military because it showed Clinton
was interested in correcting the record of segregation.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Although he has been suffering from severe health problems in
recent years, Meeks said he had believed he would live long enough
to enjoy the symbolic victory of the pardon. ``I knew God was
keeping me around for something to see,'' he said. ``But I am just
sorry so many of the others are not around to see it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meeks added that he was focusing, on a victory that, while
mostly symbolic, was sweet.
</P>
<P>
   The pardon was issued in his name alone. But he seemed to want
to share it with 49 other men. ``It makes a big difference to know
the president gave us a pardon,'' he said. ``We've been waiting a
long time.''

TRAVELERS APPARENTLY UNFAZED BY ARRESTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The high-profile border arrests this week in Washington
state and Vermont, and cautious statements from government
officials suggesting the possibility of terrorist attacks in the
United States, have not put a damper on holiday travel plans in the
Boston area.
</P>
<P>
   While some travel agencies and hotels said customers have voiced
concerns over the threat of terrorism or Y2K glitches, most people
have not canceled their plans to travel to or from the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had no cancellations to speak of,'' said Dawn Curtis,
spokeswoman for the Seaport Hotel. ``Most of the hotel's guests
will be those working in the city over the holiday. For us, it's
not an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Michaels, a travel agent at Longwood Travel in Boston,
said people have ``no real concern, but are voicing the awareness
that something might happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Michaels said travelers have not been influenced by recent media
reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think the media hype is overblown . . . I don't think
people are panicking,'' she said. She added that her agency had
customers leave Thursday on international trips without expressing
any worries at all.
</P>
<P>
   John Moore, director of operations for the Marriott Long Wharf,
said that the threat of terrorism ``sure is alarming, but has not
had any affect on us. We're looking forward to a busy New Year.''
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Robinson, a travel agent at Liberty Travel, said that
her customers are talking about the possibility of terrorism and
paying attention to new developments, but no one has taken steps to
cancel their travel arrangements.``I don't think people are that
concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Dana Vannasse, owner of Beacon Hill Travel and the spokesman for
the New England chapter of the American Society of Travel Agents,
said that he recently sold a holiday trip to Egypt for a family of
eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I closed some deals Thursday, I was sort of amused that
people would even do it, based on what we heard in the press. But
that doesn't deter people,'' Vannasse said. ``People will not be
suppressed in their desire to learn, and that's what travel's
about.''

REHEARING SOUGHT ON ELIGIBILITY RULING 
</HEADLINE>
  (pr) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lawyers for four African-American athletes who sued the National
Collegiate Athletic Association over the minimum test score
requirement for athletic scholarships said Thursday that they would
ask the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to rehear their arguments
and promised to pursue legal remedies, if necessary, all the way to
the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, in a 2-1 opinion, the judges reversed a lower
court decision that struck down the eligibility requirement, ruling
that it was unfair to African-Americans. The decision did not
address the merits of the case _ that the African-American
student-athletes are unfairly affected by the initial-eligibility
rule as determined by test scores.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the court said that college sports' governing body did
not directly receive federal funding and did not have to conform
with Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which forbids
discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin.
Because of that, they said, it was not necessary to address other
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The battle is far from over,'' said Adele P. Kimmel, a staff
lawyer for the Washington-based Trial Lawyers for Public Justice.
``We will ask them to rehear it. If necessary we'll ask the entire
court to hear arguments. I'm certain that no matter what the
decision, both sides will want to take it to the Supreme Court.
This is that important.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, Judge Ronald I. Buckwalter held that the NCAA's
Scholastic Assessment Tests and American College Test minimum score
requirement _ 820 on the former or 16 on the latter _ ``has an
unjustified disparate impact against African-Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was originally brought by two African-American
students, Tai Kwan Cureton and Leatrice Shaw. Both graduated from
Simon Gratz High School in Philadelphia in June 1996, and both
excelled in track. But despite earning academic honors, they did
not do well on the Scholastic Assessment Tests and could not get
athletic scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   The suit took aim at the standards, called Proposition 16, which
dictates initial eligibility for freshmen in the NCAA's 302
Division I schools. The standards include a core group of high
school courses and a minimum grade-point average in that core.
</P>
<P>
   Buckwalter cited the NCAA's own research showing that the
practice harmed African-American students' chances of being
declared academically eligible and that the organization's goal of
improving graduation rates _ could be achieved by other methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effect of this ruling is that the association's
initial-eligibility bylaws remain in effect, and two more important
jurisdictional questions have been answered with regard to the
application of federal law to the NCAA,'' said Graham B. Spanier,
chairman of the NCAA Division I board of directors and the
president of Penn State University.

 E-Tailing's Holiday Helpers  &HT;     By David Lazarus

<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The ``e'' drops out of e-commerce around 1 a.m. as thousands and
thousands of packages arrive at the United Parcel Service
processing center in South San Francisco.
<P>
   Although volume at this and other UPS facilities nationwide
peaked earlier, the machinery will remain at full throttle all day
today as the country's largest delivery service gives Santa a final
assist in getting presents beneath trees in time for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, UPS moved more than 307 million packages globally
between Thanksgiving and Christmas, including as much as 55 percent
of all online purchases.
</P>
<P>
   This year, company officials say the total will surely be
greater, with the Internet once again accounting for a major
percentage of holiday shipments.
</P>
<P>
   UPS handles the bulk of traffic for such prominent e-tailers as
Amazon.com, Gateway, Dell Computer and Land's End.
</P>
<P>
   ``These days, it seems like I'm delivering more and more
computers,'' said Bob Koga, who has been a UPS driver for 26 years.
``And I know people will use those computers to buy even more
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   VNo wonder analysts are so starry-eyed about the future of
e-commerce _ and the projections are indeed stratospheric. For just
about every PC that arrives for the holidays this year, an
exponentially greater number of online purchases will be made by
next year at this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Gateway alone we're moving somewhere in the neighborhood
of 300,000 packages a week,'' said Steve Holmes, a UPS spokesman at
the company's head office in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Many, if not most, of those packages, as with the vast majority
of e-commerce shipments, fall into the business-to-business
category. But that changes as the holiday season kicks into high
gear and the familiar brown UPS vans stream into residential
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The sun has yet to rise, and an early morning chill fills the
hangar-sized processing center as sorters pluck packages spilling
off the conveyor belts.
</P>
<P>
   Each package has arrived by tractor-trailer truck from Oakland
airport and other hubs. The sorters quickly determine the final
destination and place the packages into color-coded bins that
shuttle on tracks around the loading bay.
</P>
<P>
   Loaders at the backs of open vans reach into the bins _ red for
Pacifica, green for Daly City _ and place each parcel into the
appropriate vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Early deliveries are placed near the front of the van, later
deliveries near the rear.
</P>
<P>
   It's a finely tuned system, which, when working correctly,
allows drivers to make as many as 270 stops and deliver more than
300 individual packages each day during the peak season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very intense,'' said Sunny Chan, a driver who has been
with UPS for 15 years. ``This week, I'll be making about 30 stops
an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   A glance inside just one truck reveals a virtual who's who of
online retailing. Cow-patterned Gateway boxes, books from Amazon
and Barnes &AMP; Noble, goodies for critters from Pets.com _ the
parcels are stacked all the way to the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   UPS estimates that its busiest single day this year fell on
December 17 as some 18 million packages were shipped worldwide. But
drivers at the South San Francisco facility said they were making
more deliveries on Monday and Tuesday of this week.
</P>
<P>
   The disparity illustrates the slippery nature of e-commerce
statistics. The simple fact is that nobody really knows how much
stuff is being purchased online, or when, or at what price.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the ``experts'' don't try. Forrester Research, the
Cambridge, Mass., consulting firm that specializes in Internet
trends, estimates that online shopping this holiday season will
total $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Its New York rival, Jupiter Communications, places this figure
at $6 billion, while the Gartner Group's Dataquest unit projects
$8.6 billion in online gift purchases.
</P>
<P>
   At the high end of the crystal-ball gazing, consulting giant
Ernst &AMP; Young says this season's shopping spree on the Net will
rack up as much as $15 billion in sales, or nearly four times as
much as Forrester's best guess.
</P>
<P>
   Every organization crunches the numbers differently, so analysts
at each defend their predictions by stressing that Internet-related
projections are an inexact science and that their goal is to
provide a broad view of online activity as opposed to hard and cold
facts.
</P>
<P>
   But ask Glen Ramos, a sorter at the UPS facility, and he'll be
happy to explain specifically how e-commerce is changing the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the Internet, we worked five or six hours a night,'' he
said while transferring packages from the conveyor belt into
constantly moving bins. ``Now it's six or seven hours. The volume
is much heavier.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramos has been arriving at work in recent weeks at 1 a.m. During
nonpeak times he usually starts around 4 a.m. He goes pretty much
nonstop channeling packages toward the right delivery vans, and
then, after the vans roll for the day, Ramos heads off to his
second job with an insurance firm.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, UPS says it has no problem with night workers
holding day jobs as well. In fact, the company will do just about
anything it can to keep employees happy. It can't afford to lose
them.
</P>
<P>
   To meet the crush of the holidays, UPS has to hire more than
90,000 seasonal workers, mostly high school and college students
looking to score some extra cash during winter vacations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell people, `If you can get to work, I can make you
successful,''' said Dave Jensen, the ``preload primary
coordinator'' who oversees part-timers shifting parcels between
conveyor belts.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the most intellectually demanding work, but Jensen
noted that a lapse in concentration can send a package bound for
San Francisco on its way to San Mateo.
</P>
<P>
   Such mishaps can be among the myriad reasons an item ordered
online may take an inordinately long time to reach a buyer's hands.
</P>
<P>
   The popular conception of e-commerce is one of bright, shiny
information technology fostering sales that are untouched by human
hands. But the reality, more often than not, is a yawning, sleepy
teenager tossing boxes onto belts.
</P>
<P>
   To help expedite things, UPS posts its own employees at the
shipping facilities of major customers. At Amazon's warehouses, for
example, UPS loaders will ensure that parcels make it onto the
right trucks bound for the correct hub.
</P>
<P>
   The sun is up at last and the morning bright and clear in South
San Francisco as the final packages are loaded onto some
approximately  &LR; 200 vans waiting to begin their rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're almost there,'' Ed Lynch, manager of the portion of the
processing hub serving the Peninsula, told a gathering of drivers.
``Keep it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Hicks, the only woman driving a van (or working at the
facility, for that matter), joined her colleagues in expressing
relief that the peak season is almost over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really heavy, especially with the Internet shopping,''
she said. ``It's pretty crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   And then the drivers climbed aboard their vehicles, started
their engines, and a long convoy of brown vans poured onto the
street, jingling all the way.

PROSECUTORS CITE WOMAN'S LINK TO ALGERIAN TERRORISTS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGTON, Vt. _ The Canadian woman arrested Sunday at a
Vermont border crossing is linked to a radical Algerian group
believed to ship arms to terrorist groups, prosecutors told a
federal judge Thursday at a detention hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The government's allegation that Lucia Garofalo, 35, of
Montreal, is connected to a key member of the Algerian Islamic
League heightened concerns that Garofalo and Algerian extremists
based in Canada might have transported explosives into the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo was ordered held until Dec. 30 so investigators can
pursue other leads that might tie her to international terrorist
organizations. She and Buoabide Chamchi, an Algerian national
arrested with her, so far have been charged only with immigration
and passport violations.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors said that the car Garofalo was driving was
registered to Brahim Mahdi, an Algerian national living in Canada
whom prosecutors identified as a ``primary member'' of the Algerian
Islamic League. In addition, they said, Mahdi bought the cell phone
she was using.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the Algerian Islamic League, Mourad Dhina, is
connected to groups that have committed terrorist acts in Europe
and Algeria, according to Assistant US Attorney Tristram J. Coffin.
</P>
<P>
   Dhina, a physicist who now lives in Switzerland, is reported to
be an international arms dealer ``actively involved in the shipment
of arms to terrorist organizations,'' Coffin told US Magistrate
Judge Jerome J. Neidermeier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Particularly troubling is the connection between the
defendants and persons affiliated with known Algerian extremist or
terrorist organizations and sympathizers,'' US Attorney Charles R.
Tetzlaff told the judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the possible ramifications for national security,
this is far from an ordinary detention case.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamchi was ordered detained until a probable cause hearing Jan.
6. Niedermeier ruled that Chamchi, 20, who has been living in
Canada under temporary refugee status, poses too great a risk of
flight.
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo, who officials said listed $8 in assets but travels
extensively in Europe and the Middle East, told US Customs
officials on recent attempts to enter the United States that she
was traveling to Boston. Tetzlaff declined to say what efforts
investigators are making to track Garofalo's connections in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public can rest assured that the government is
investigating this case in a very thorough and extensive manner,''
Tetzlaff said.
</P>
<P>
   But Garofalo's court-appointed attorney, Maryanne Campmann, said
the case appeared to be ``ethnic profiling,'' based on her client's
statement that she has an Algerian husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that much of this case is based on assumptions and
innuendo,'' Campmann said.
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo's arrest followed a series of attempted border
crossings.
</P>
<P>
   She successfully entered the United States, with two men that
officials described as ``Middle Eastern'' in appearance, on Dec. 6
at Pittsburg, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   At the remote crossing, controlled by only a camera and two-way
speaker at the time, Garofalo said she was heading to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   She returned to Canada through Stanstead, Quebec, on Dec. 12,
this time with a self-described Algerian national and another
person identified as her son. On Dec. 15, once again using the same
car, she retreated from the US border at Pittsburg, after guards
instructed her through a loudspeaker to report to an inspection
station. A Pakistani-born Canadian traveling with her said he did
not have identification papers.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Chamchi produced an apparently altered French
passport when he and Garofalo were stopped at the remote border
crossing in Beecher Falls, Vt. The pair said they had accidentally
entered Vermont while seeking a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   After questions were raised about the passport and the
circuitous route that the pair had taken from Montreal, two dogs
trained in explosives detection alerted officials to the right rear
panel of the 2000 model Neon that Garofalo was driving.
</P>
<P>
   FBI analysis of the substances found there did not yield any
evidence of explosives or ``explosive precursors,'' Coffin said. A
test for nitrates, often used in explosives, has not been
completed, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities previously had said that trace amounts of explosives
might have been found in the car. Tetzlaff declined Thursday to
identify the substances sent to the FBI lab in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Chamchi, who has been arrested at least twice in Canada for
stealing and breaking into motor vehicles, is said by Canadian
intelligence sources to be linked to Algerian radicals living in
Montreal who help finance terrorist acts through crime.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Ressam, the Algerian arrested in Washington state last
week with bomb-making material in his car, also lived in Montreal
and had ties to the criminal group, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors said their evidence indicates the case might
be much more than smuggling illegal immigrants across the border.
Neidermeier said the case ``is either a run-of-the-mill
alien-smuggling case or something more serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Coffin said the account on the cell phone Garofalo was using was
activated by Mahdi on July 29 and, four days later, transferred to
Garofalo. Preliminary analysis shows many international calls,
including countries in the Middle East and Canada, the attorney
said.
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo's husband, Yasim Rachek, is an Algerian national
deported from Canada in 1993 for using a fake French passport.
Rachek, now living in Italy, was arrested in London in 1996 for
using a fake Greek passport with a substituted picture, Coffin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo, a Canadian native who receives welfare and has three
children, has in-laws residing in Algeria from a previous marriage,
her attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   US investigators are working with Canadian authorities to
determine if Garofalo is linked to a 1992 theft and sale of
dynamite in Ontario. A phone number connected to Garofalo was
called several times in January 1992 from a telephone used by a
person being investigated in the heist.
</P>
<P>
   US attorneys produced little background on Chamchi. Coffin said
Canadian immigration officials reported that he entered that
country in June 1997 as a stowaway, contradicting Chamchi's
assertions that he had been living in Canada for 3 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
   Chamchi told US law enforcement officials that he worked full
time, Coffin said, but he could not remember the name of the
company. A default warrant for his arrest is outstanding in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   If a link to Dhina, the director of the Algerian Islamic League,
can be shown, the possibility of a terrorist conspiracy would be
heightened. Dhina, who has worked for the European Center of
Nuclear Research, fled his native Algeria for Europe a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dhina, also known as Sheik Ahmar, is believed to have been the
main go-between in Europe for Kamareddine Kerbane, the coordinator
of the Islamic fundamentalists' foreign networks. Dhina fled France
for Switzerland in 1995 after police raided his home.
</P>
<P>
   Dhina is believed to have provided much of the equipment
deployed in a car-bomb campaign in Algeria in 1994. He also has
made extensive use of the Internet and other modern computer
technology in his arms-purchasing efforts, according to Swiss media
reports.

 Not All Internet Startups' Draw Venture Cash  &HT;     By Kelly Zito 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
So there are dot-com firms that don't have massive amounts of money
thrown at them.
<P>
   CookExpress, a year-old San Francisco company that delivers
semi-prepared ingredients for gourmet dinners, shut down its site
yesterday during one of its peak times of the year, citing
financial woes.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to www.cookexpress.com who type in their ZIP codes to
receive a menu see this message:
</P>
<P>
   ``CookExpress.com has suspended service until further notice. We
hope to reopen for business the beginning of the year, after we
have completed a key round of funding. We would like to thank you
for your ongoing support and apologize for any inconvenience this
may have caused you.''
</P>
<P>
   Company officials say they simply ran out of money.
</P>
<P>
   The firm didn't fail to meet sales goals, said founder Darby
Williams. But it has had trouble luring investors who believed in
the potential for selling gourmet-quality food over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   CookExpress, whose ``kits'' arrived as fresh ingredients,
measured, prepackaged and ready to cook, isn't cheap. Entrees range
from $14.95 to $21.95 and delivery is $4.95 per order for orders
under $60.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had a problem executing on our strategy, it's just
a matter of the capital to take us to the next step,'' Williams
said.
</P>
<P>
   The company has raised roughly $3.5million through two rounds of
funding in the past 18 months and is now looking for another round
worth about $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the shutdown, Williams said CookExpress' customers
haven't turned against the company and ``will be there waiting for
us to relaunch.''
</P>
<P>
   But others aren't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't help in building the brand,'' said Allen Bonde,
director of the market research arm of Extraprise, a Boston
e-commerce consulting firm. ``I don't know how much money they're
spending driving people to the site, but they're basically pouring
that revenue down the drain. Plus the negative impression of
consumers trying (to use the site) and saying `I'll never go there
again.'''
</P>
<P>
   Each week, the dot-com world seems to defy common sense,
offering up another record-setting IPO or stock price. But failures
aren't uncommon, said Tamar Zemel, corporate communications
director at VentureOne, a venture capital research firm in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that weird,'' she said, noting that VentureOne
doesn't track firms that don't meet funding goals or go out of
business. ``How many investments go bad? There are plenty of
companies that don't make it. It's possible (CookExpress) will get
their round, and it's possible that they will not.''
</P>
<P>
   CookExpress, along with online grocery sellers Webvan.com and
Peapod.com, has been the subject of scores of articles regarding
the expected growth of Internet food shopping.
</P>
<P>
   The company, founded by Williams, an ex-Microsoft executive,
launched its site in January 1999 and counts among its board
members Bay Area culinary guru Bradley Ogden.
</P>
<P>
   Although Internet food and beverage sales were a modest $235
million last year, Forrester Research predicts they will double
annually, hitting $5 billion in 2002 and $10.8 billion in 2003.

ON SECOND OUTING, ASTRONAUTS CONTINUE UPGRADE OF TELESCOPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By WARREN E. LEARY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Hubble Space Telescope got smarter and better able
to point at distant astronomical targets on Thursday as
spacewalking astronauts replaced two major pieces of the
observatory's gear.
</P>
<P>
   On the second spacewalk of the shuttle Discovery's Hubble repair
mission, the astronauts, C. Michael Foale and Claude Nicollier,
swapped out the observatory's central computer and one of its fine
guidance sensors, a precision pointing device.
</P>
<P>
   The spacewalkers ventured into Discovery's cargo bay, where
Hubble towers almost four stories above, at 2:06 p.m. EST, about 45
minutes earlier than scheduled, to get a jump on their busy day of
replacing some of the telescope's most important components.
</P>
<P>
   The excursion followed the first spacewalk by Steven L. Smith
and John M. Grunsfeld on Wednesday. They replaced Hubble's six
stabilizing gyroscopes, the focus of the mission, and added
protective devices to the observatory's six aging batteries to
prevent them from overheating and overcharging.
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials said Thursday that initial tests of the
gyroscopes and the voltage-temperature improvement kits for the
batteries showed that they were properly installed and in good
working order.
</P>
<P>
   John Campbell, NASA's Hubble program manager, declared the
repair mission's objectives 80 percent complete with the success of
the first spacewalk. Hubble, scheduled to be released by Discovery
on Christmas Day, should be back on the job making scientific
observations about two weeks later, Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   In the second of three scheduled spacewalks, Foale and Nicollier
got to work immediately upon exiting the shuttle, which was flying
above Australia at the time.
</P>
<P>
   For Nicollier, a Swiss astronaut with the European Space Agency
who has flown on three previous shuttle flights, including the
first Hubble service mission in 1993, it was his first spacewalk,
or EVA (for extra-vehicular activity) in NASA terminology.
``Welcome to the EVA fraternity,'' said Smith from inside
Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great privilege to work on Hubble for the astronomical
community all over the world,'' said Nicollier, an astrophysicist,
after first exclaiming, ``What a view!''
</P>
<P>
   Foale, a veteran of five previous shuttle flights and two
earlier spacewalks, led the effort to extract Hubble's central
computer while positioned on a workstation at the end of the
shuttle's 50-foot robot arm. It took more than two hours to replace
the computer and move to the next task, but the astronauts soon got
confirmation that they had succeeded when Mission Control said
initial tests showed that the computer was functioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hubble not only has new brains, it's thinking,'' said
Steven Robinson, mission communicator at the Johnson Space Center
here.
</P>
<P>
   While the new computer is a big improvement for Hubble, having
20 times the speed and six times the memory of the old one, it is
hardly state-of-the-art by current personal computer standards.
</P>
<P>
   Hubble's new brain is powered by an Intel 486-DX2 chip running
at a speed of 25 megahertz, a processor long obsolete in desktop
computers now driven by newer Pentium chips. NASA officials said
computer chips used in space must be specially manufactured and
tested to work in that harsh environment, which keeps them
generations behind what is used on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to keep in mind that we don't do Windows, we don't
have disks and we don't do the Internet,'' Campbell explained,
jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   Following the computer work, the astronauts tackled the
laborious task of exchanging a bulky Fine Guidance Sensor, one of
three optical devices used for precision pointing and measurement.
</P>
<P>
   The 480-pound device is one that was removed during the second
Hubble servicing mission in 1997 and refurbished.
</P>
<P>
   With Nicollier working on the robot arm, the spacewalkers
removed an older sensor and tried to slide the new one into place
along a set of guiderails.
</P>
<P>
   The new unit initially stuck part way into its slot. After
discussion with ground controllers, the astronauts removed it and
were successful on the second attempt. Early tests indicated that
the replacement was working as planned, mission officials said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The old guidance sensor was stowed on the shuttle and will be
refurbished for reinstallation on the telescope during a service
mission planned for 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's walk in space is to be the only one for Foale and
Nicollier during this mission. When the mission was planned, the
pair had been scheduled to make another excursion, but that EVA was
canceled when Discovery's much delayed flight was cut from 10 to
eight days.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Grunsfeld are to make the third and final spacewalk of
the mission on Friday, when they will replace a faulty radio
transmitter and exchange a tape data recorder with a solid-state
model. The telescope is scheduled to be released into space on
Saturday. Discovery is set to return to Earth on Monday.

 &HT;    The two faces of John Rocker
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARNER ROBINS, Ga. _ It was a wonderful Christmas story. An
8-year-old boy, who has spent most of his life indoors because of a
condition that robbed him of an immune system, is asked if he has a
special wish.
</P>
<P>
   He wishes he could play baseball. So some nice people who live
in Middle Georgia arrange for Ben Fuller to play ball with a couple
of home-grown major-leaguers. John Rocker of nearby Macon and the
Atlanta Braves would pitch. Mark Johnson, who still lives in town
and catches for the Chicago White Sox, would be behind the plate.
</P>
<P>
   The wish came true last weekend at the local high school
baseball diamond.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Ben Fuller's mom wonders. Did the real John Rocker show
up? Or was the whole thing a fairy tale that ought to be remembered
with, ``Once upon a time ...''
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker, who exposes himself with disparaging comments in
this week's Sports Illustrated, even seems in the article to be
unkind to children. While driving to a school for the
learning-disabled, Rocker was asked if he enjoys speaking to
children. ``No,'' he said, ``not really.''
</P>
<P>
   That comment hurt Ben's mother, Jean Langston, more than
Rocker's slurs against nearly every ethnic group on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe it,'' Langston said. ``I can't see a person
who would give up part of his Saturday to pitch to a little boy he
didn't know being so mean-spirited. But I will never let Ben or my
other children know what he said. I'm not sure that Ben would even
want to bat against him, if he knew that.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she will try not to let Rocker's controversial opinions
ruin the memory of last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In advance of the big day, Rocker had sent Ben a Braves shirt.
He autographed a sleeve. Rocker, his parents and his girlfriend
arrived at Langston's home to drive in a police-escorted caravan
down Russell Parkway. Only about 50 friends and relatives watched
Ben's wish come true, but Jake Rocker was happy that they could see
this soft side of his son. The senior Rocker said he regretted that
John would have to leave after a few pitches to attend a relative's
funeral in Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   ``John doesn't like to disappoint anyone,'' Jake said. ``He'd
like for there to be four of him and 48 hours of every day.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it began, Rocker lobbing left-handed pitches to Ben,
who'd never hit a baseball in his life. Ben had swung at a tennis
ball in his yard the few times he had ventured out, wearing a mask
that keeps him from germs.
</P>
<P>
   After fouling off a number of Rocker's first 15 pitches, it
happened. Ben hit a sharp liner past first base. The crowd of 50
screamed like 50,000. ``Go, Ben,'' Langston yelled.
</P>
<P>
   He stole second _ never mind that there weren't any fielders _
while his brother, Hiram, was batting. He raced all the way home
from second. A youngster handed Langston the ball. ``Ben's first
hit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Next time up, he got another hit and Rocker chased him down the
first base line, laughing. And then another hit, and another.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun,'' Ben said. ``Really fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good feeling for me,'' Rocker said. ``It's important to
do stuff like this for kids. I'm sure Ben never expected me and
Mark to come out and give him a treat like this. Who knows, maybe
it will make a difference in his illness and it'll turn him around
and he'll get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Langston is a 34-year-old single mother going through a second
divorce. She had to give up a good job as a dental assistant to
care for her four boys. Three of them have serious conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Ben, who will be 9 in January, is a ``bubble boy,'' born without
an immune system. It is risky for him to leave an antiseptic
environment; a common cold could be fatal. This week, Langston had
to send Ben to his nurse's home in Atlanta while she battled
bronchitis.
</P>
<P>
   Hiram, 13, has a heart condition. Lance, 11, recently had a
three-pound tumor removed from his brain and experiences violent
siezures. Preston, 7, is healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life has had a lot of hardship, but I'm a very happy
person, believe in God a lot, and I lean completely on the Bible,''
Langston said. A turning point for Ben came last fall, when doctors
at Duke University told his mother that a bone marrow transplant
would be too risky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed to choose,'' Jean said. ``Was I going to keep him in
the house until he's 18 (a fatal turning point for those with his
condition) or did I want to try and let him get out a little bit.
If you think of David, the bubble baby in the '70s, his mom kept
him in that bubble until he was 18. He left the bubble and died
within days. So what is my purpose in not giving Ben a little life?
This is life. Me, my family, my friends and the doctors decided
together, `Let him go.' If it's one year or one month, give him
that glory.''
</P>
<P>
   She'd already tried to treat Ben like something of a normal kid.
He collects baseball cards, plastic horses and plastic and glass
angels. He has more angels than he can count. Country singer Shania
Twain heard about Ben from her doctor. She's been calling him the
past three years.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball outing was arranged by Steve Rogers, a local Air
National Guard cop who has developed one fund-raiser after another
for Middle Georgians in need.
</P>
<P>
   When Rogers asked Ben if he could have a wish come true, what
would it be, he replied, ``Well, I already know Shania Twain. I
guess if I could have any wish in the world I'd like to play
baseball.'' He's only been allowed outside to play without a mask
the past three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `Ben, you're going to get to play ball with one of
the Braves and someone from the White Sox,''' his mother said. ``He
goes, `Why?' Then he asked me, `Am I gonna play 'cause I'm gonna
die?' I said, `No, Ben, no. You're going to play because you want
to play.' He doesn't talk of it much and he's not afraid of it, but
he knows the illness.'' Which makes what has become of John
Rocker's image all the more perplexing.
</P>
<P>
   It has put Rogers, a friend of the pitcher for only the past
several months, on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If John's boat is the Titantic, I won't jump,'' Rogers said.
``I won't leave him.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Rogers called Jim Schultz, the Braves'
public-relations man, and offered to do anything on Rocker's
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to stand in front of a thousand microphones and
defend John Rocker, I'd do it,'' Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a 25-year-old kid who was shooting from the hip,''
Rogers said. ``Yesterday, when the story broke, he was in a charity
benefit for Nicaraguan relief. Is that a racist? When he played for
the Macon Braves, he had Andruw Jones living at his house for 18
months. Is that a racist?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of other people have done more serious things and gotten
past them,'' he said. ``John's a good person. His heart is good.
``This is the season for forgiveness and love and coming
together,'' Rogers said, ``not for crucifixion.''

<P>
   Online holiday shopping is increasingly gnawing at the business
of traditional retailers this year, with preliminary indications
that seasonal Internet sales may nearly triple from last year.
</P>
<P>
   Visa, which represents about half the nation's credit card
spending, estimates that Internet shoppers using its cards will
have spent $1.47 billion this November and December, 179 percent
more than in those months last year.
</P>
<P>
   In the overall retail market, that figure is still small _ 1.79
percent of Visa's total retail sales, up from 0.76 percent last
November and December. And with the economy buoyant and retail
sales expected to rise by 6 percent overall this holiday season,
the big store chains have yet to see the Internet take a
substantial bite out of their sales.
</P>
<P>
   But the overall trends may mask a more troublesome phenomenon
for those retailers, experts say, as stores find that their best
customers are the quickest to move online.
</P>
<P>
   ``The retailers are feeling the pain because the fattest part of
their market is moving online,'' said Mel Bergstein, chief
executive of Diamond Technology Partners, a Chicago consulting
firm. ``The guys online don't buy the $10 gifts. They're the big
spenders.''
</P>
<P>
   And this year there are more of them. A New York Times/CBS News
poll of 1,026 adults Dec. 17-19 found that 17 percent had bought
gifts over the Internet this holiday season or planned to do so,
compared with 7 percent who said they had done so last year.
</P>
<P>
   The growth in Internet holiday spending reflected in the Visa
data is at the high end of industry forecasts. Various analysts had
predicted online holiday sales would be up from 61 percent to 219
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   American Express said its online retail sales had increased
roughly 200 percent from last year's holiday season, although it
would not provide precise numbers. (MasterCard said it did not
track online sales.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, sales were bound to increase given the blitz of
television advertising by Internet stores over the last month, many
offering deep discounts and free shipping. And some wonder whether
the rapid growth might taper off, were Wall Street to demand that
Internet companies ever turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to give away stuff for free,'' said Toby Lenk, the
chief executive of eToys, one of the fastest growing Internet
stores. ``A lot of dot-com start-ups and wanabees are spending more
in advertising than they are taking in sales, and they are
discounting heavily. You've got to question the viability of that
business model.''
</P>
<P>
   To others, though, the rapid growth in Internet shopping this
holiday season reinforces the predictions that the share of online
shopping will continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have seen so far is the tip of the iceberg,'' said
Gerry Sweeney, a vice president of Visa's electronic commerce unit.
``By 2003, we believe that 10 percent of our volume will come from
the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   With that potential threat, this year many of the best-known
names from the country's malls and mailboxes have opened up major
stores on the Internet as well.
</P>
<P>
   And early measures show that some of the traditional players
have attracted quite a lot of traffic, with their well-known brands
and the convenient potential of returning unwanted items to their
stores. Surveys show that Toys ``R'' Us, KBKids, the Gap, Costco,
Wal-Mart Stores, and Lands' End along with Barnes &AMP; Noble, already
a Web veteran, appear to have significant growth in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   But there is some evidence that while many traditional retailers
are attracting visitors to their Web sites, the Internet-only
stores are doing a better job of making sales.
</P>
<P>
   Next Card, a credit card company, notes that based on its tally
of sales, a greater percentage of the people who visit eToys, an
Internet-only toy store, make purchases than visitors to
Toysrus.com. And the average purchase is $65 for eToys and $45 for
Toysrus.com.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Toysrus has attracted far more sales than it can
handle. On Wednesday it said it would give $100 gift certificates
to a group of customers who might not receive their toys by
Christmas. It declined to say how many customers were affected.
Toysrus was hardly alone. eToys and KBKids were among the toy
stores that left some parents giftless.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, the problems faced by the online toy companies spoiled
what many people said was otherwise a very satisfying experience
shopping on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times/CBS News poll found that of those who shopped
for gifts online, 62 percent said the experience was better than
shopping in a store; 25 percent said it was the same, and 8 percent
said it was worse than a store. The online shoppers cited the
convenience, lack of crowds and the speed of shopping as the main
benefits over traditional stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toys are the perfect category for online shopping,'' said
Katherine Borsecnik, a senior vice president at America Online, on
which toys and other children's merchandise has been the top
selling category this holiday season. ``No one likes to go to a toy
store between Dec. 15 and Christmas, and a Pokemon from an Internet
site is no different than a Pokemon from a Toys `R' Us store.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the online sales are not just at the expense of
retail stores. While traditional mail-order catalog sales are still
greater than Internet sales, the catalog business is growing
slowly, and some merchants are reporting tough going. Lands' End,
for example, said its sales fell by 18 percent in the first five
weeks of the fourth quarter, a much bigger drop than expected.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the rise in online buying is proving a boon to
the delivery business. The Postal Service says that Priority Mail
shipments are up 8 percent this holiday season, largely because of
Internet businesses. It has had to charter an addition 100
airplanes mainly to serve customers with major online operations,
like Amazon.com, eToys, QVC, Lands' End, and a few others, a
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Express says its volume is up about 20 percent this
holiday season, in part because of electronic commerce. United
Parcel Service says that Internet companies are driving a volume
increase and that many of its biggest customers are now online
stores, but it declined to give specific numbers.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Studies of Web surfing behavior show that visitors to shopping
sites peaked the week ended Dec. 13. Media Metrix, a New York
research firm, estimates that the online shopping audience declined
by 6 percent in the week ending Dec. 20 from the previous week. But
traffic increased at some sites offering gifts that do not require
packages to be shipped, like Enews.com, which sells magazine
subscriptions, and Americangreetings.com, which offers e-mail
greeting cards.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Putting an overall dollar figure on holiday e-commerce is far
from a science. Since Visa represents about 54 percent of card
spending in the country, its data suggest that about $3 billion is
being spent on online retail purchases in the last two months of
the year. But Visa cautions that the numbers may slightly
underestimate sales levels because some merchants with both
traditional and online business may not be identifying Internet
sales separately. And while nearly all purchases from online stores
are made by credit card, many buyers on person-to-person auction
sites like Ebay, are made by check.
</P>
<P>
   Market research firms have been predicting online sales for the
holiday season as high as $6 billion to $9.5 billion, but their
methodologies and definitions may vary significantly from those of
Visa. Many rely on surveys of consumers and merchants rather than
actual transaction records. The National Retail Federation
estimates that total retail sales over the holiday season will be
$185 billion.

 &HT;    The other guy: Rocker's
 &HT;    volatility surfaced down stretch
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two years ago this month, John Rocker was banished to
Puerto Rico, wondering if the baseball thing would ever work out.
</P>
<P>
   A four-year minor leaguer who had only made it to Class AA a few
months before, Rocker had been shipped off to the Puerto Rican
winter league to test his stuff as a potential closer. Ignored on
all the prospect lists, he was just another hot-rod arm with a
vague affiliation with the strike zone; the Braves had sent him to
the bullpen because they had run out of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   And then one afternoon with a game on the line, Rocker was
called in to face Juan Gonzalez, hero to all the island and pure
murder on left-handed pitching. For reasons he has never been able
to clarify, Rocker determined he would sprint to the mound, where
he promptly struck out Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I said to myself, `This can work,''' Rocker said. It became
a trademark, soon joined by a Goldberg T-shirt and a mound act so
packed with flinches and winces, he flits around like Rodney
Dangerfield on speed.
</P>
<P>
   And he also became nearly unhittable. Steeled by the Puerto
Rican winter, Rocker just needed one break, which came in the form
of Mark Wohlers' back strain two months into the 1998 season. What
has happened since, accelerated by Kerry Ligtenberg's elbow injury
last spring, is one of the joys of the Braves' player development
department.
</P>
<P>
   Forty saves in 49 career opportunities, 146 strikeouts in 110
1/3 innings, 13 career playoff innings without an earned run. And
for now, the Braves want to be as far from him as they can get.
</P>
<P>
   ``He happens to be an employee of ours. He works for us,''
general manager John Schuerholz said. ``He wears the name of our
company on his uniform. But in no way do the comments and the
attitudes and the feelings that he expressed represent those of the
Atlanta Braves.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker's one-man siege upon political correctness, as reported
in this week's Sports Illustrated, has laid open an unseen aspect
of his character, a fairly unknown commodity until the later
stretches of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he has ``no place in my heart'' for Rocker's comments,
Hank Aaron, the most storied player to wear a Braves uniform said,
``I'm sick and disgusted about the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened? Was Rocker somehow transmuted this season into
the crowd-baiting loon who sparred with all Shea Stadium last fall?
No. Rocker was always loose. He hit the Braves clubhouse trailing
stories of the times he had bitten into baseballs that would not
behave in the bullpen, of challenging catchers to throw balls into
his chest when his control wavered in side sessions.
</P>
<P>
   But there were a pair of incidents last season that hinted at
Rocker's deep irascibility. On June 29 in Montreal, he produced the
worst performance of his major-league career, allowing five runs in
two-thirds of the ninth inning in a 6-5 loss. Vladimir Guerrero
ended it with a three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Most pitchers might drop the memory _ an almost mandatory
ability for relievers _ but Rocker was still so livid 45 minutes
after the fact, he wound up in a bitter tirade against the Expos,
one of the game's worst teams last season. His comments had most
Braves shaking their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how a team that's 28 games under .500 can sit on
every pitch like they knew what's coming,'' Rocker fumed that
night. ``If they're that good, why aren't they at least a .500
team? It amazes me.''
</P>
<P>
   That hardly made Rocker the first pitcher who has had trouble
absorbing defeat, but a September incident stunned the club. Rocker
had saved a Sept. 5 game against Arizona, striking out Kelly
Stinnett for the 27th out and what should have been a 5-4 win.
</P>
<P>
   But catcher Eddie Perez dropped the third strike, first baseman
Randall Simon forgot to cover first, Perez threw the ball away and
the Diamondbacks wound up scoring three runs and winning 7-5. Simon
confessed to his error, but Rocker singled him out to the media
afterward, bad form in any clubhouse, especially with the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Within three weeks, Rocker had begun taunting Mets fans at Shea
Stadium and what followed is highlight-reel history. It hardly
presaged what happened this week, but in retrospect, it describes a
man who, rather than avoid confrontations, rushes straight to them.

FOR CRUISE SHIPS' WORKERS, MUCH TOIL, LITTLE PROTECTION
</HEADLINE>
   (Special Report) 
(rk) 
 By DOUGLAS FRANTZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The kitchen on a cruise ship starts bustling for
breakfast before 6 a.m., and some days the workers do not stop
peeling, cooking and washing until after the midnight buffet. For
laboring as long as 18 hours a day, seven days a week, most galley
workers are paid $400 to $450 a month.
</P>
<P>
   These are the migrant workers of the oceans, the thousands of
dishwashers, assistant cooks, cabin cleaners and brass-rail
polishers who toil unnoticed and unheard aboard luxury cruise
ships. Most are from third world countries, working for months
without a day off, living in shared quarters with little or no
access to the ship's public areas.
</P>
<P>
   Long hours and subsistence wages are part of their contracts, as
is the threat of being fired without notice or cause. Yet people
from some of the world's poorest nations are so eager for work that
some pay middlemen the equivalent of a month's wages to get these
job, a fee that violates international law.
</P>
<P>
   These are boom times for the cruise industry. Record numbers of
passengers are packing bigger and grander ships, providing record
profits for the dominant lines. Miami-based Carnival Corp., with 45
ships the world's largest cruise company, is averaging $2.8 million
a day in profits this year, almost all tax-free because the company
is registered in Panama.
</P>
<P>
   But the benefits have been slow to trickle down to the 70,000 or
so workers who keep the fleets running and the passengers dining
and dancing. Though living conditions have improved, pay for most
has risen little, and some workers say their work has become more
grueling as ships have grown into floating cities bustling with
activity 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Even though 90 percent of the nearly 6 million passengers
sailing out of U.S. ports in 1999 were American, and most lines
have their headquarters in the Unates, the companies escape
American minimum wage requirements and other labor laws the same
way they avoid corporate income tax and many criminal and
environmental laws: they register their corporations and ships in
countries like Liberia and Panama, where laws are lax and
enforcement is weak.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise industry representatives say that they provide good job
opportunities and that wages are competitive with the rest of the
maritime industry, and often much better than what workers could
earn at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most appropriate comparison to shipboard jobs would be
jobs that these individuals would be able to obtain in their home
countries _ jobs that do not offer either the earning potential or
opportunities for advancement and that do not include full room and
board, medical care and transportation benefits that are provided
to cruise line employees,'' the International Council of Cruise
Lines, the industry trade group, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Per capita income in the Philippines, for example, which
provides thousands of workers to the cruise industry, is about
$1,000 a year. Over the course of their long hours, Filipino
waiters and bartenders on a ship can earn 20 times that in tips, in
addition to being provided room and board. Even the lowest-paid
crew members earn about $400 a month, a substantial sum in many
places.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival Cruise Line said that its starting salaries have
increased for many jobs and that it recently created the industry's
first retirement plan for shipboard employees. Carnival would not
disclose its pay scale, but said that a good waiter, with tips,
could earn as much as a counterpart on the mainland in the United
States, and that cabin stewards earn more than maids do in American
hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Critics in Congress and the American maritime industry describe
the foreign-flagged cruise ships as operating ``inside our waters
and outside our laws,'' as several put it. They contend that the
practice has led to increased pollution and problems enforcing some
criminal laws. In addition, American cruise companies say that the
economic advantages of foreign-flagged ships have stifled any
attempt to create a sizeable fleet in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Even those laws that do govern the foreign-flagged cruise
industry are often ignored or bent. Despite a 70-hour week
suggested by the International Labor Organization, which is
affiliated with the United Nations, seafarers routinely work 80 to
90 hours a week without extra pay, many said in interviews.
</P>
<P>
   And despite laws requiring free medical care and adequate sick
pay for injured or sick seafarers, crew members sometimes find
themselves shipped home or living on a few dollars a day in sick
wages while waiting for care. Some unions have negotiated benefits
below those available by law; some workers do not even realize they
are covered by a labor agreement.
</P>
<P>
   After questions about work conditions were raised as this
article was being prepared, the industry trade group announced on
Thursday that its 17 members had adopted voluntary guidelines to
govern the shipboard workplace. Among the guidelines are pledges
that wages will be competitive with international pay scales, that
crew members will be given opportunities for training and career
development, and that employees have the right to voice complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Seafarers are not indentured servants, and many develop
satisfying careers on ships. Some outside advocates applauded the
industry for improving working and living conditions on board and
said complaints of exploitation have declined in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it an ideal lifestyle? No,'' said the Rev. Peter Larom,
executive director of the Seamen's Church Institute, an advocacy
group based in New York. ``Is there a sharp improvement curve? I
would say yes. And for seafarers, these are valued jobs.''

</P>
<P>
   But just as passenger accommodations range from luxury
staterooms with balconies to cramped interior cabins, life for the
1,000 or more crew members aboard a cruise ship is rigidly
stratified.
</P>
<P>
   At the top are the captain and other officers, who are usually
European and earn $40,000 to $60,000 a year or more. They have
staterooms and are encouraged to socialize with passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Next come the skilled seamen and various supervisors, who earn
$1,500 to $2,000 a month, usually share a cabin with someone else,
and have little contact with passengers unless their jobs require
it. Some workers, like waiters and cabin stewards, are paid as
little as $50 a month by the lines, but can earn $2,000 a month or
more through tips.
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom are the unskilled workers who clean the kitchens
and cabins, wash the laundry, polish the brass and mop the engine
rooms. They routinely sleep four to a cabin and are restricted to
crew quarters below deck. They are told to speak to passengers only
if spoken to first. Most send their earnings home; some, to help
their families, work a second shipboard job.
</P>
<P>
   These workers sign contracts that keep them at sea from four to
ten months. When the contract is up, they get a few weeks off _
without pay, insurance or a guaranteed job when they return. In the
best of circumstances, it can be a hard life.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The model wage and hour scale established by the International
Labor Organization, suggests a minimum wage of $435 a month for
low-level seamen who work 10 hours a day, seven days a week. More
often, workers and their lawyers say, the hours are longer. And
those at the bottom of the heap are most likely to have paid a fee
to get their job, to have paid their own air fare, to know the
least about their rights and to have little chance for advancement.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to pay $400 for my job,'' said Del Ray Miller, who
started out earning $415 a month cleaning kitchens on Norwegian
Cruise Line ships 80 hours a week, and was making $500 a month
three years later cleaning vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought it from a cruise agent in Jamaica,'' Miller said. ``I
had to borrow the money for my job and air fare. I did this to help
my family. I have three kids and my wife plus my mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who has been unable to work for more than a year because
of an injury, said: ``I thought my pay would rise and I would be
able to pay back the loan. It did not happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Another crew member, Julio Castillo, was given a receipt, marked
``job placement fee,'' for $500 cash for a job on a Norwegian
Cruise Line ship. The stories and the sums were similar in
interviews with many workers for other cruise lines.
</P>
<P>
   International conventions, as well as the laws of the United
States and other countries, expressly prohibit charging seafarers
fees for jobs. The cruise lines say that they pay outside agencies
to find employees but that they forbid charging workers for
anything except administrative fees. Carnival, the largest line,
said that it would terminate any agency that charged seafarers for
a job.
</P>
<P>
   Employees at several agencies in Miami would not discuss
recruiting practices, but the owner of Velkin Personnel Services,
Ludmila Velasquez, acknowledged charging placement fees to
seafarers. She said she did it because cruise lines had told her
they did not have the money to pay her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a nonprofit,'' Mrs. Velasquez said, adding that she
had no idea such fees were illegal. She said she had recently
stopped recruiting for the cruise industry.

</P>
<P>
   The same needs that drive people to pay for these jobs help keep
workers silent about long hours that violate their contracts and
about difficult conditions, according to advocates and lawyers for
seafarers. Often those who do object find themselves unable to get
work at the end of their contract. Several people said recruiting
agencies blacklist workers who complain.
</P>
<P>
   Four Filipino waiters filed suit in state court here three years
ago, claiming that they had been blacklisted after objecting to
being forced to return part of their tips to their cruise line and
hiring a lawyer, Luis A. Perez, to represent them. Lawyers for
Majesty Cruise Line, the company that employed the waiters, denied
retaliating and said the lawsuit was the result of a
misunderstanding. The case is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas B. Stevenson, director of the Center for Seafarers'
Rights, which is affiliated with the Seamen's Church Institute,
said there was ample evidence of blacklists. ``There are so many
people ready, willing and able to take these jobs that you are not
going to find too many people willing to complain, because they are
afraid of losing their job and being blacklisted,'' Stevenson said.
</P>
<P>
   In October, at a sentencing hearing in Miami for Royal Caribbean
Cruises on pollution-law violations, the Justice Department said
the disparity in work, pay and opportunities for advancement on
ships made employees less likely to call attention to crimes like
the cruise line's yearslong dumping of contaminated waste water.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work practices hardly empower the lowest levels to
challenge pollution practices or provide such employees a direct
route of communication with senior ship or shore-side managers, as
good corporate compliance practices would dictate,'' prosecutors
said in court papers.

   There is other evidence that workers fear complaining. Santos
Alfredo Henriquez, a kitchen worker aboard a Carnival ship, fell
down a flight of stairs while carrying a load of plates. Henriquez,
who is from El Salvador, hurt his back, but did not report his
injury until the pain became nearly intolerable, according to a
suit he filed against Carnival in Miami-Dade County Circuit Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of Carnival's inhumane policy of requiring the poor
seamen to pay for the plates that they break, the plaintiff was
afraid to report his accident, and also thought that he would be
fired because Carnival is well known to send men who are injured
home and not to rehire them,'' the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival's lawyers said that Henriquez had received proper
medical care and that the company did not retaliate against injured
seamen. A spokesman said the line did not charge employees for
breaking dishes. The case was settled last March when Carnival paid
Henriquez $100,000.

   Maritime laws have protected seamen for centuries because they
are so much at the mercy of the owners and officers of their ships.
One of the earliest written codes, the Rules of Oleron, dating from
13th century Europe, required ship owners to provide free medical
care for sick or injured seamen. Seven centuries later, seamen
still sometimes run into trouble collecting their benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Prem Prakashram Sukram worked 15 years in the engine rooms of
cruise ships before he broke his ankle in a fall last year. He said
his supervisor had told him the injury was not serious and insisted
that he return to work. Eventually, he said, the ship's doctor sent
him home to Guyana for medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Sukram said he had been reluctant to go because he had seen
other injured workers sent home and never return to work, and also
because he was concerned about his medical bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they would pay,'' Sukram, a 37-year-old father of
three, said. ``I went home for six months and I sent the bill to
the company. There was no reply. I called and they hung up the
phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated and in debt, Sukram said, he borrowed money and flew
to Miami, where he stayed in the basement of a rundown hotel for
several weeks waiting for his money. Eventually Sukram filed suit
in state court in Miami against a management agency that operated
the ship on which he was injured.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, in court papers, denied any wrongdoing, and its
lawyer, Domingo Rodriguez, declined to comment. Two weeks ago
Sukram received money for his medical bills and back wages and
returned home.

<P>
   Miller, the injured kitchen worker from Jamaica, filed suit in
state court here, claiming he had not received proper medical care
and full sick pay from Norwegian Cruise Line. He was injured in
1998 and has languished since January in a modest Miami motel room,
where several printed prayers are tacked to the headboard of his
bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the money was small, I sent my money home because
I have to take care of my family,'' Miller said. ``But since I was
injured there is no pay to send home.''
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian Cruise Line paid for Miller to see several doctors and
is paying for his motel room. In addition, he receives money for
food and $12 a day in sick pay. The company's lawyer said in
responding to the suit that doctors had determined that Miller was
fit to return to duty and therefore should no longer entitled to
sick pay and maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually the only American law that does apply to crew members
aboard foreign-flagged ships is the maritime law provision for sick
pay to injured and ill seafarers. American courts have generally
agreed that the law applies to ship owners with substantial
business interests in the United States, a definition that covers
the major cruise lines.
</P>
<P>
   The maritime law says seafarers are entitled to sick pay equal
to full pay while they were working, including overtime and tips,
until the end of their contract. But cruise companies have fought
aspects of the law, sometimes calculating sick pay on base salary
only and cutting off sick pay at the end of a voyage.
</P>
<P>
   The differences can be significant, as Christina Gheorghita
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gheorghita, who is from Romania, was a cabin stewardess
aboard Royal Caribbean's Enchantment of the Seas in early 1998 when
she got sick and had to leave the ship. She was earning about
$2,500 a month in tips, or roughly $80 a day, but her sick pay was
$12.50 a day.
</P>
<P>
   When she questioned the discrepancy, she discovered that $12.50
was set by a collective bargaining agreement with the Norwegian
Seaman's Union. The agreement also permitted Royal Caribbean to
fire Ms. Gheorghita and stop her sick pay at the end of the
seven-day voyage, even though she had a six-month contract.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being protected, Ms. Gheorghita discovered that a
union to which she did not know she belonged had bargained away
some of her rights under American maritime law, according to a suit
she filed in federal court in Miami against Royal Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   The non-Norwegian workers, who make up the majority covered by
the agreement, did not have union cards, never attended union
meetings or voted for officers, and did not approve the contract
terms, according to the complaint. It also said most workers, like
Ms. Gheorghita, did not even know they were in a union, in part
because Royal Caribbean paid the $300,000 a year in dues directly
to the union, rather than deduct them from paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Rose Bernard, a lawyer for Royal Caribbean, said in
court papers that the company had negotiated in good faith with the
union. She said the terms were incorporated in Ms. Gheorghita's
contract, and a company official testified that workers were given
copies of the union agreement when they were hired.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean is registered in Liberia and its ships fly
Liberian and Norwegian flags. When asked in a deposition last year
if he knew what benefits were provided by American maritime law,
Johan N. Oyen, the director for the Norwegian union in Miami,
insisted that American law did not apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Norway is an independent country with its own constitution and
we couldn't give a damn about American law under that respect and,
you know, just as the United States doesn't give a damn about
Norwegian law,'' Oyen s   In an interview, he defended agreements with Royal Caribbean,
Norwegian Cruise Line and other companies, saying they represented
the best wages and conditions available in the competitive market
and met standards set by the International Labor Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The Gheorghita case was tried before Judge William M. Hoeveler
and a decision is expected soon.
</P>
<P>
   Had the cruise industry's Washington lobbyists succeeded three
years ago, the Gheorghita case and others might never have been
brought, at least in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The House approved legislation drafted by the industry, and
sponsored by Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska., to prohibit foreign
seafarers from filing suit in American courts in most instances.
The cruise lines said most suits should be handled in the home
countries of the seamen. The bill was blocked in the Senate and has
not been resurrected.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, cruise lines have had mixed success using other
means to shift cases to foreign courts, where awards are sometimes
smaller and the laws often prohibit lawyers from taking cases on a
contingency basis, making it harder for aggrieved seafarers to find
representation. Many companies put clauses in employment contracts
requiring that suits be filed in the seaman's home country or the
flag country of the ship. Even a distinctly American icon, the Walt
Disney Co., has a clause designating that suits be filed in the
Bahamas, where its ships are flagged.
</P>
<P>
   Larry W. Kaye, a lawyer who represents cruise companies, said
that nothing was unfair about requiring a seafarer to bring a case
in his or her country and that legal remedies available elsewhere
were often equivalent to or better than those here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a mistaken premise to assume that we are the only nation
with decent laws and a decent court system,'' Kaye said. ``In
certain third world countries where the system doesn't function,
they should have access to our courts. In other cases, they should
litigate at home.''

<P>
   Online holiday shopping is increasingly cutting into the
business of traditional retailers this year, with preliminary
indications that seasonal Internet sales may nearly triple from
last year. Visa estimates that Internet shoppers using its cards
will have spent $1.47 billion this November and December, 179
percent more than in those months last year. In the overall retail
market, that figure is still small _ 1.74 percent of Visa's retail
sales _ but it signals troublesome phenomenon for traditional
retailers, experts say. Stores are finding that their best
customers are the quickest to move online.

 By MICHAEL WINES    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Santa Claus is coming to town. And is Ded Moroz ever
annoyed about it.
</P>
<P>
   Ded Moroz _ in English, Grandfather Frost _ is the beloved
embodiment of the Russian holiday season, an ancient gent decked
out in a fur-trimmed suit and a white beard who rides around in a
sleigh and brings presents to all good children. Walk around
downtown Moscow these days, especially near the big toy emporium,
Detsky Mir, and you are likely to see him roaming the streets. This
is, after all, his turf.
</P>
<P>
   It was, anyway, until Santa Claus began muscling in on the
action. Now, whatever the spin about a kindly old elf with a fat
belly, the message to Ded Moroz is unmistakable: You better watch
out.
</P>
<P>
   However likely it is to spot Ded Moroz tramping through the
snow, missing his Western rival has become all but impossible,
thanks mostly to the power of multinational marketing. Every corner
grocery has at least one huge poster of Santa Claus hawking
Coca-Cola; his image is plastered in stores selling consumer goods
from clothes to jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's thousands of street vendors sell Santa Claus trinkets.
A giant inflatable Santa hangs atop a collection on shops on
upscale Petrovka Street. Even Detsky Mir, which employs its own
live Ded Moroz, sells Santa Claus ornaments and Santa Claus dolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, in big cities like Moscow, he has become even more
important than Ded Moroz,'' said Mariya Volkenshtein, general
director of the Russian market research firm Validata. ``You can
see it in the shops, in the things you can buy, in the drawings.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether even a place as big as Russia is big enough for two
bearded, gift-dispensing icons is an open question, for despite the
surface similarities, the two men are really nothing alike.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Ded Moroz (pronounced dead morose, to English
speakers' amusement) is a closet Stalinist and an atheist. Before
the Communist revolution in 1917, Russians celebrated Christmas _
albeit in early January, as specified in the Julian calendar _ and
St. Nicholas was the Christmas spirit of choice.
</P>
<P>
   Stalin ordered the traditional gift-giving shifted to New Year's
Day and rehabilitated St. Nick as Ded Moroz. Thinner, more
imperious and less given to ho-ho-ho's, Ded Moroz wears an
ankle-length robe, carries a scepter and rides in a troika pulled
by three horses rather than reindeer.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing as the horses do not fly, Ded Moroz delivers presents by
knocking on the door rather than plunging down chimneys. He is
accompanied by Snegurochka, the Snow Maiden, a pigtailed fairy who
must be called out from hiding by children.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of communism swept away many Soviet traditions, but
Ded, Snegurochka and the notion of gift-giving on New Year's have
stuck fast. Thus the return of religion and St. Nicholas, in the
form of Santa, have created a dizzying state of holiday confusion.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1998 survey by Moscow's Public Opinion
Foundation, 13 percent of Russian families observe a Western-style
Christmas on Dec. 25. The remainder exchange gifts on Jan. 1, and
observe a Russian Orthodox Christmas on Jan. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone takes off from work and parties until Jan. 14, the New
Year according to the Julian calendar _ or, as Russians call it,
Old New Year.
</P>
<P>
   For a nation that already observes two New Years and two
independence days (Soviet and Russian), two Christmases and two
Santas may not seem much of a leap. But as with all things Western
these days, Russians seem decidedly ambivalent about Santa Claus.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Merchants tend to love him, and if they sell Western goods, they
have little choice. Ordinary workers have adapted to Christmas
Western-style by starting their annual New Year's break on Dec. 25
instead of Jan. 1, bringing the nation to a halt for three weeks
instead of two.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians, riding a wave of Russian patriotism, increasingly
view Santa Claus as an interloper and a cultural imperialist. They
are led by Mayor Yuri Luzhkov of Moscow, who has vowed to make Ded
Moroz a symbol of Russia's cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Luzhkov paraded Ded Moroz around town in a troika
and held a reception for the old fellow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at our huge, beautiful Ded,'' he boasted then. ``You
can't compare him to that puny Santa Claus!''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not. But this year, Luzhkov has chosen to compete with
Santa on his own terms: he has arranged a marketing deal for Ded
Moroz.
</P>
<P>
   By agreement with the governor of a northern region, the mayor
has proclaimed that Grandfather Frost's legendary home is in a
remote forest town, Veliky Ustyug, 500 miles northeast of the
capital. Hoping to build tourism, officials there will open Ded
Moroz's palace this week.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Luzhkov will open a sprawling winter home for Ded
Moroz on the site of a vast souvenir flea market in northern
Moscow. There Grandfather Frost will greet children, preach the
spirit of giving and sell Ded Moroz knickknacks.
</P>
<P>
   In Veliky Ustyug, a joint stock company, OAO Ded Moroz, has
trademarked Grandfather Frost's name, and companies there are
busily producing Ded Moroz wooden souvenirs, Ded Moroz postcards,
Ded Moroz candy and Ded Moroz vodka.
</P>
<P>
   Putting Grandfather Frost's mug on a bottle of vodka is
something at which even jolly old capitalist Santa might blanch.
But there is an explanation: ``Every adult, in his heart, is
nonetheless a child,'' a tourism specialist from Veliky Ustyug's
regional government says.

BOARD OF EDUCATION VOTES AGAINST RENEWING SCHOOL CHANCELLOR'S
CONTRACT
</HEADLINE>
   (See also NY-CREW-MAYOR) 
(sw) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After weeks of complaining that Schools Chancellor
Rudy Crew had lost his focus and slipped into deep ambivalence
about his job, the New York City Board of Education voted 4-3 on
Thursday to end Crew's tenure when his contract expires next June.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Crew said he was so disgusted by the board's action
that he might leave sooner, raising the possibility that the
nation's largest school system, with 1.1. million children, would
be left rudderless at a time when it is under enormous pressure to
introduce tough new graduation standards and raise test scores.
</P>
<P>
   The votes to oust Crew were cast by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
three allies on the board and by Terri Thomson, the Queens member
who in recent months has acted as the swing vote.
</P>
<P>
   Those members said after the vote that they had been
particularly troubled by Crew's behavior in recent weeks. They
cited his persistent refusal to reveal whether he wanted to stay
on, his shrugging off a state report charging widespread attendance
fraud, and his jibe last week that a city councilman was ``too
short'' to criticize him.
</P>
<P>
   But a supporter of Crew, William C. Thompson, the board
president, said after the vote that ``the mayor's fingerprints are
on this'' and that it was ``a recipe for disaster for this school
system.''
</P>
<P>
   For Crew, Thursday's vote, which took place 10 minutes into a
closed board meeting that lasted less than an hour, ended a
four-year tenure marked by several major accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Crew persuaded the state Legislature to curtail the power of the
city's 32 local school boards, giving the chancellor more say over
the appointment of local superintendents, ended the automatic
promotion of failing students and helped negotiate a deal to end
lifelong job protection for principals.
</P>
<P>
   But standardized test scores have largely remained flat under
Crew's leadership, and New York City still lags behind the rest of
the state on graduation rates, spending per pupil and the
percentage of students taking and passing tough new Regents tests.
</P>
<P>
   Crew benefited from strong political support for much of his
tenure, but his close relationship with Giuliani deteriorated last
April after he fiercely and successfully resisted the mayor's plan
to experiment with school vouchers. In May, Giuliani infuriated
Crew again by persuading a majority of board members to reject the
chancellor's $11 billion school construction plan, handing Crew his
first defeat by the board since it hired him in October 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Crew kept a low profile on Thursday, staying inside his home in
Brooklyn Heights with his four grown children, who were visiting
for the holidays. He issued a long, at times emotional statement
that did not address the vote at all, but alluded to his battle
with Giuliani over vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   In the statement, Crew said that he had realized last spring
that ``it might be impossible to restore the solidarity that marked
my first three years as chancellor.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has not publicly criticized Crew in recent months, but
he has frequently complained that the school system is a failure
and has refused to say whether Crew should remain on the job. But
one person close to the Giuliani administration said on Thursday
that the mayor had planned to support a yearlong extension for Crew
because Giuliani was presumably running for the Senate next year,
and he did not want to face the political repercussions of ousting
a popular black chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   But the person close to the administration, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said that Giuliani's anger at Crew boiled
over this week after Crew made a last-minute request for a raise
and a pension supplement. Crew already makes $245,000 a year,
compared with $195,000 for Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   The board members voting not to renew Crew's contract were Ms.
Thomson, Deputy Mayor Ninfa Segarra, Jerry Cammarata of Staten
Island and Irene H. Impellizeri of Brooklyn. Voting for him were
William Thompson, of Brooklyn, Dr. Irving S. Hamer Jr. of Manhattan
and Dr. Sandra E. Lerner of the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The board had a deadline of Jan. 1 to tell Crew whether they
wanted to extend his contract, but William Thompson and the other
members said in recent weeks that they needed to know whether Crew
truly wanted to stay before making a decision. Early last week,
Crew finally told Thompson that he wanted to stay for two or even
three years, and he asked Thompson to work out the details of a new
contract with his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Crew's aides said that when he asked for the extension, he also
requested a pension supplement worth twice his annual salary, or
nearly $500,000. Ms. Segarra, one of Giuliani's two appointees to
the board and one of Crew's harshest critics, said after the vote
on Thursday that the chancellor had also requested a raise and that
those last-minute demands were ``the straw that broke the camel's
back.''

TRADE PANEL RULES AGAINST U.S. PENALTY ON SUBSIDIZED STEEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (pr) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ A World Trade Organization dispute panel sided with the
European Union on Thursday in a challenge to American duties
imposed to counter state subsidies for British-produced steel. If
upheld, the ruling could prevent the United States from levying
penalties on products made by state-owned companies that are later
privatized.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, though, in a broader case, a separate WTO panel
ruled in favor of the United States, finding that although part of
a 1974 U.S. trade law permitting the use of sanctions was contrary
to current international rules, the law had so far been carried out
in a way that conformed with WTO requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's ruling, which declared American steel duties contrary
to global trade rules, comes at a time that the country's steel
industry is struggling to limit imports.
</P>
<P>
   The office of the U.S. trade representative, Charlene
Barshefsky, quickly said that it would appeal the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We strongly disagree with the panel's reasoning,'' said Thomas
Tripp, its spokesman. ``A mere change in ownership doesn't render a
company's production unsubsidized.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue are American import duties imposed from 1994 to 1996 on
leaded bars produced by British Steel Corp. _ since merged into
Corus Group _ which received an estimated $14 billion in government
assistance. The 15-member European Union, backed by Brazil and
Mexico, argued that the United States had erred by imposing
countervailing duties on British-produced steel because of the
benefits gained from subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   The United States maintained that a company receiving such
government aid gained an unfair advantage for its products that
continued into any new ownership situation.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, in a 47-page ruling, said Washington failed to show
that the subsidies ``had been bestowed directly or indirectly on
the production of those imports'' where the duties had been levied.
It suggested that American officials ``take all appropriate
steps,'' including changes in administrative practices, to prevent
such violations from reoccuring.
</P>
<P>
   The American Iron and Steel Institute, whose officials were not
available for comment, filed friend-of-the-court papers arguing
that huge subsidies for British Steel permitted it to ``buy
equipment and facilities that the market could not justify, train
workers who could not have been trained without subsidies, lower
debt, or otherwise artificially benefit its production.''
</P>
<P>
   The infusion of cash between 1977 and 1986 ``literally kept
steel-making afloat'' in Britain, with serious consequences for
other countries' manufacturers, the institute declared.
</P>
<P>
   Any appeal of Thursday's decision must be made within 60 days.

CRUISE INDUSTRY ADOPTS WORK RULES

<TEXT>
<P>
   The cruise ship industry Thursday released voluntary guidelines
setting forth the rights of crew members to fair treatment,
including pledges to provide clean quarters, competitive pay and
the right of seafarers to voice complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines were adopted by the International Council of
Cruise Lines, the trade group in Washington that represents the 17
foreign-owned major cruise lines operating in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia A. Colenda, the council president, said in a statement
that most of the guidelines reflected practices already in place
and that they extended beyond the requirements set by agencies that
regulate the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines were approved after questions were raised by The
New York Times about workplace conditions on cruise ships. Bridget
Ann Serchak, the group's spokeswoman, said the issue had been under
consideration since summer. Earlier this year, the council adopted
guidelines requiring that shipboard crime be reported to proper
authorities and that cruise lines improve compliance with
environmental laws.
</P>
<P>
   The code for crew members calls on cruise lines to comply with
international regulations on labor practices, pay wages equal to or
exceeding those in the nations from which crew members are
recruited and provide them with free medical care and room and
board in clean, well-maintained quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The code also says that the workplace will be safe, that
employees should be at least 18 years old, and that crew members
cannot be subjected to physical, sexual or verbal harassment. In
addition, it says, seafarers have the right to voice complaints
without fear of retaliation. The new code is be made available to
all crew members.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise council also released a set of guidelines governing
gambling aboard ships that it said were designed to ensure fair and
professional gaming for customers.

PROPOSED CHANGE IN TAX LAW SENDS GERMANY'S STOCK MARKET SOARING

<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ In a move that sent Germany's stock market
soaring, the government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder endorsed
plans Thursday to untangle the web of cross-ownership in German
companies that have defined their structure since the end of World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, which came as a big and pleasant surprise to
business executives and investors, would allow banks and insurers
to sell their huge industrial shareholdings without paying a tax on
the profits, unleashing tens of billions of dollars into the German
economy.
</P>
<P>
   That tax, currently at 50 percent, is among the highest in the
world, and it has effectively prevented such share sales in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Executives cautioned that the proposed change has a long way to
go before becoming law, partly because it is unclear if the
chancellor's Social Democratic Party, senior partner in the
governing coalition, will fully support it or give in to pressure
from its left wing.
</P>
<P>
   But if the proposal does become law, it would strike at the very
heart of the corporate structure in Germany, Europe's largest
economy _ a structure, that has been built around cross-ownership
between banks, insurers and industrial conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   This is an important reason why, for example, Deutsche Bank, the
country's biggest, has been a major shareholder in DaimlerChrysler,
the biggest automaker, and why Allianz AG, Germany's leading
insurer, is a longtime shareholder in 17 of the 30 big companies in
the benchmark DAX stock index.
</P>
<P>
   The present system contributed mightily to Germany's postwar
economic boom, but it has also bred what critics see as cronyism,
rigidity and arrogance toward smaller stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   Banks and insurers have long wanted to prune such industrial
stockholdings and reinvest the proceeds in their core businesses.
But they faced billions of marks in capital-gains taxes if they did
so.
</P>
<P>
   German political leaders have chafed at the power of financial
institutions, but did not want to be accused of handing out big
corporate tax breaks. Yet Thursday, government officials said that
was what they planned to do. ``This change will give an important
boost to the modernization and restructuring of industry,'' the
Finance Ministry said in a brief statement.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks here soared on the news, particularly those of banks and
insurers. The DAX index rose 4.46 percent, the biggest one-day gain
in more than nine months. Shares of Munich Re AG, one of the
world's biggest insurers, soared almost 17 percent, to 255 euros.
Deutsche Bank stock jumped 15 percent to 81.4 euros. Allianz, the
biggest direct insurer, rose 12 percent, to 336.51 euros.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Callow, chief European economist at Credit Suisse First
Boston, said the proposed changes went ``to the heart of the way in
which the German economy is financed and structured and owned''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are really seeing,'' he added, ``is a key turning
point, away from the post-1945 methods of financing the German
economy to a more Anglo-Saxon approach based on widespread
shareholder ownership.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's biggest banks and insurers hold more than $150
billion of ``hidden reserves,'' shares in companies that were
acquired over many decades.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank's portfolio is worth about $22 billion. It
includes 12 percent of DaimlerChrysler and about 7 percent of
Allianz.
</P>
<P>
   Allianz has a $30 billion portfolio, which includes major stakes
in two other big German financial institutions, Dresdner Bank and
Bayerische Hypo-Vereinsbank.
</P>
<P>
   German banks and insurers have wanted to prune these holdings
for years, so they could move their money into faster-growing
companies, but have been deterred by the prospect of taxation.
</P>
<P>
   Bank executives and industry analysts remained skeptical about
the government's plans. Schroeder has come under attack from the
left wing of his party on other matters, and has shifted between a
pro-business pragmatism and the Social Democrats' more traditional
left-wing positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would still be skeptical,'' one executive said. ``But if it
is true, it is a very positive thing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Executives were equally surprised by the government's way of
disclosing the plan. It was buried in a much broader tax reform
plan introduced on Tuesday, not even mentioned until banks and
insurers started asking questions Thursday. The government offered
no explanation for why it did not announce the proposed change more
prominently.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said the proposal, if adopted, would unleash tens
of billions of dollars worth of stock for re-investment. They also
said it would probably accelerate an already-blistering pace of
mergers and acquisitions in Europe, where economic integration and
the single currency have been reducing barriers to corporate
takeovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should this proposal be put into effect, it would be positive
for the economy,'' said Diethard Breipohl, chief financial officer
of Allianz. ``A restructuring of the German corporate landscape
would be possible, leading to more growth and employment.''
</P>
<P>
   Allianz is already gearing up for an overhaul of its holdings.
This fall, it hired the head of Goldman Sachs' Frankfurt office,
Paul Achleitner, as its new chief financial officer. Achleitner,
who was been in the middle of Germany's biggest mergers, has been
given the responsibility of streamlining Allianz's portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank, which has been a pillar of the old system, is
also poised for restructuring. More than a year ago, it put all its
stockholdings into a separate new subsidiary, DB Investor, with a
goal of managing the portfolio much more actively.
</P>
<P>
   But such efforts have been constrained by the tax liability, and
the matter appeared to be in political deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   Detlev Rahmsdorf, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank, said the new
proposal, if it became law, would be a breakthrough. ``From an
economic standpoint,'' he said, ``it means that capital allocation
would be much more improved and much more dynamic. The links
between banks and big corporations will become looser, that's for
sure. Everything will be judged and every deal will be decided on
its own economic merits.''
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank's own experience provides vivid examples of the
old system's weaknesses. Like other big German banks, it has been
the lead lender to many of the biggest companies. When things went
sour, it stepped in with financial help, often exchanging its old
debt for new equity.
</P>
<P>
   But Deutsche Bank lost heavily in the early 1990s, when it was
forced to help bail out Metallgesellschaft AG, a conglomerate that
ran up billions in losses in commodity trading.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank also led a rescue attempt for Philipp Holzmann AG,
a huge but troubled construction company, in which it owns a 15
percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   Holzmann received a bailout in 1997, and one of Deutsche Bank's
board members became chairman of Holzmann's supervisory board. But
Holzmann again got into deep trouble, and Deutsche Bank was stuck
with several billion marks in loans as well as potentially
worthless stock.
</P>
<P>
   After Schroeder volunteered government guarantees and loans,
Deutsche Bank was able to corral other lenders into a new bailout
for Holzmann totaling $2.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Johannes Reich, head of equity research at Metzler Bank in
Frankfurt, said the tax proposal could increase earnings at the
biggest banks and insurers by 10 to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really would be a revolution,'' he said. ``Germany as a
closed shop wouldn't exist anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Reich said the Finance Ministry appeared to be serious. He
cautioned that the proposal had not yet been put in full legal
language, let alone passed by Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But he said government officials had provided detailed technical
reasoning on how the proposal could be melded with existing law.
``They all said that this is what they want to do,'' Reich said,
``and that there is nothing that should dilute the plan from their
point of view.''

CONSERVATIVE PANEL MEMBER LEAVING `THIS WEEK' PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (pr) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the first move of a promised makeover of ``This Week,'' the
troubled ABC Sunday morning political discussion show, the network
has parted company with the conservative commentator William
Kristol, a member of the program's weekly roster of pundits.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen Murphy, the vice president for communications at ABC
News, said the network had decided not to offer Kristol a new
long-term contract. His current contract ends on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to keep Bill, but only on a short-term deal,'' Ms.
Murphy said. ``That was not what he wanted. We did not want to
stand in his way.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristol said he declined the ABC offer. ``I had three good years
on the show,'' he said. ``I feel like I worked hard and made a good
contribution. I like the people very much. I have no complaints.''
</P>
<P>
   The ratings for ``This Week,'' which for years was the dominant
Sunday morning network talk show, have been in a deep slide over
the last year. ``This Week'' is now well behind the network leader,
``Meet the Press'' on NBC, and more recently has begun to fall
behind ``Face the Nation'' on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   The timing could hardly be worse as the shows enter an election
year, when there is additional focus on them as they try to book
the prospective presidential candidates as guests. ``Meet The
Press'' and its anchor, Tim Russert, have scored several booking
coups in recent weeks, including the first extended interview with
George W. Bush and last week's news-making debate between Al Gore
and Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a decision to fix the show,'' Ms. Murphy said.
``It was a step along the way. In no way did anybody think he was
the problem with the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristol said he was gratified Thursday by the number of calls he
had received from other networks and cable outlets. ``I heard from
every other network and all the cable news channels,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kristol said he had not committed himself to any other program,
though he works for The Weekly Standard magazine, which is owned by
Rupert Murdoch. Murdoch's News Corp. also owns the Fox network,
which has its own program, ``News Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kristol said he did expect to land somewhere else soon,
adding a self-deprecating prediction, ``I don't think the American
public will be suffering from being deprived of my views.''

CLASS ACTIONS NEED THE RIGHT ELEMENTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Class-action lawsuits are one of the ways employees
can recover damages if their civil rights have been violated. There
are lawyers who will take the cases and front the expenses, which
can be thousands of dollars, to win big discrimination verdicts
involving hundreds of employees.
</P>
<P>
   However, that ability to certify a class of people _ a group
that has faced systematic discrimination that is typical in a race,
sex or national-origin lawsuit _ is getting more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans ruled
in a case involving Venezuela's state-owned Citgo Petroleum Corp.
that mental anguish and other compensatory damages can't be grouped
together in a class action.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that mental anguish is inherently individual, so
a general class-action ruling on compensatory damages isn't
feasible _ even though all the employees in the group may have
experienced discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The case, which is known as the Allison decision, after Citgo
employee James E. Allison, has thrown a wrench into the strategy
used by plantiff's attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, David Berg, the well-known criminal and civil
trial lawyer, has filed a race discrimination class action against
GC Services, a Houston-based debt collection agency and phone
servicing center. To get around the Allison decision, Berg is
asking the court for front pay, back pay and punitive damages. The
company has 6,400 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Back pay is compensation for lost wages between the time of
termination and the time of trial. Front pay is typically an
alternative to reinstatement and is money intended to minimize the
effect of discrimination in the future. It may take someone who has
been unlawfully fired awhile to get back to his former income
level.
</P>
<P>
   With the number of employees involved, front and back pay still
is worth several million dollars, Berg said. Individual employees
could then file their own lawsuits for mental anguish.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PROVING DISCRIMINATION &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Berg argued before U.S. Magistrate Judge
Calvin Botley that GC Services systematically refuses to hire
blacks as managers and that the case should be certified as a class
action. Botley is expected to rule later this year or early next
year on whether the case will be certified for class status.
</P>
<P>
   Berg said that while 48 percent of the employees are minorities,
only 2 percent are above the level of assistant manager. (However,
GC Services hired a black executive earlier this month, Berg said.)
And Berg said company officials repeatedly told hiring managers in
Atlanta to hire only white employees.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence appears strong: The former head of the Atlanta
office testified at the hearing in front of Botley that he was
instructed many times to hire just white employees.
</P>
<P>
   GC Services, which is owned by Jerold B. Katz, is a big company.
Berg said the company's annual revenues are at least $7.5 billion.
And the company, whose clients include American Express, MCI and
the IRS, has hired Daryl Bristow, the famous trial lawyer from
Baker &AMP; Botts, to launch its defense.
</P>
<P>
   Bristow argues that Berg can't make an end run around Allison
like he is trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   It was tried in a case in West Texas, Bristow said, and it
didn't work then. And, he said good lawyers will take individual
cases that may be worth $100,000 or $50,000 or even $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   However, ``they may not attract a David Berg who doesn't want to
touch something for less than $1 million an hour,'' Bristow said in
his Oklahoma drawl.
</P>
<P>
   Bristow disputes the allegations of race discrimination at GC
Services and said there was no central hiring authority that
directed race-based hiring.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
GAINING PERSPECTIVE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though Berg storms ahead, the Allison decision has made
employment lawyers reluctant to take on class-action cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many cases are worth trying over front pay?'' asked Larkin
Eakin Jr., who represented 600 black Pennzoil employees in a race
discrimination case that was settled earlier this year for $6.75
million.
</P>
<P>
   Eakin believes the U.S. Supreme Court eventually will weigh in
because other federal circuit courts have allowed class-action
verdicts that included mental anguish. However, Eakin isn't looking
for a test case anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a hot issue, he said, and the high court probably will
wait for more circuits to rule. A more interesting question, he
said, is whether a class member can sue later for mental anguish
and punitive damages.

U.S. LINKING JAILED COUPLE TO TERRORISTS FROM ALGERIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TERROR-CANADA, TERROR-VOICES) 
(sw) 
 By DAVID STOUT with ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal authorities said on Thursday that they had uncovered
links between a man and a woman arrested at a remote U.S. border
crossing in Vermont on Sunday and people associated with Algerian
terrorist organizations.
</P>
<P>
   A federal magistrate ordered the suspects _ Lucia Garofalo, 35,
of Montreal, and Bouabide Chamchi, 20, of Algeria _ held for
further investigation after the U.S. attorney for Vermont, Charles
R. Tetzlaff, said their case had ``possible ramifications for
national security.''
</P>
<P>
   But the government was not specific on what, if anything, its
investigators think Ms. Garofalo and Chamchi were planning to do in
the United States. And a statement by the Justice Department, which
included a reminder that the defendants are innocent until proved
guilty, illustrated the tight rope that the authorities have been
walking recently in trying to alert citizens about terrorist
threats without causing panic.
</P>
<P>
   The government did not cite any connection on Thursday between
the two people arrested in Vermont and the arrest of Ahmed Ressam,
who was stopped as he tried to enter Washington state by ferry on
Dec. 14 and whose rented car was found to contain bomb-making
materials.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Ms. Garofalo and Chamchi said in court on Thursday
that the cases against their clients were thin. Ms. Garofalo's
court-appointed counsel, Maryann E. Kampmann, said her client was
being held on the basis of ``associations and innuendoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garofalo and Chamchi were arrested on Sunday at Burlington,
Vt., on immigration charges after a border check found Chamchi's
French passport to be fake, the authorities said. A day later,
bomb-sniffing dogs acted as though they had sniffed traces of
explosives, although the authorities have conceded that later tests
turned up nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the authorities say telephone-billing records and
the car the two were arrested in link Ms. Garofalo to Brahim Mahdi,
who according to American intelligence officials is a ``primary
member'' of a group called the Algerian Islamic League.
</P>
<P>
   Citing their intelligence sources, the authorities said on
Thursday that the Algerian group was founded and headed by Mourad
Dhina, whom they described as an Algerian arms dealer living in
Switzerland who is connected to groups that promote terrorism in
Europe and Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   Mahdi and Dhina immediately denounced the government's
descriptions of them, saying they are anything but terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know her _ I don't know Chamchi,'' Dhina said in an
interview outside his Geneva apartment, where he lives with his
wife and five children. Dhina, 38, is a physicist who studied at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am personally against any act of violence in the United
States or any other part of the world,'' Dhina said. He described
the rumors about him as ``surreal,'' and said the Algerian
government had tried to discredit him for being critical of its
oppressive rule.
</P>
<P>
   Dhina said he was active in a group called the Front Islamique
du Salut, which he said was a social organization, not a nest of
terrorists. He said he was a spokesman for a political arm of the
group and had no connection with any other organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Mahdi, in an interview with The Associated Press outside his
Montreal apartment, said he had never heard of the Algerian Islamic
League. Mahdi said the telephone records and the car that so
intrigued investigators were easily explained. He said he had
transferred his cellular phone to Ms. Garofalo, whom he described
as a friend, when he realized that he could not afford it. And he
said that while the car the defendants were arrested in was
registered to him, it had actually been paid for by Ms. Garofalo's
mother. Ms. Garofalo herself could not get a car loan, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont on Thursday, federal prosecutors told the magistrate,
Judge Jerome J. Niedermeier, that they needed more time to assess
the risk posed by the defendants and whether they would be likely
to flee if released. The judge scheduled a hearing for Thursday on
whether Ms. Garofalo should be released, and he set a hearing for
Chamchi on Jan. 6.

REMARKS COULD HURT ROCKER MOST OF ALL

<P>
   John Rocker's remarks about New York Mets fans and New York
residents in general, as reported in Sports Illustrated this week,
have put his future as the Atlanta Braves' closer in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks, which were also ethnically and racially offensive
in tone, have ignited a firestorm of protest and condemnation of
Rocker from his teammates and residents of Atlanta, and may make it
impossible for the Braves to keep him on the team.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the very fans whom Rocker clearly dislikes so much
could well be cheering him next season if the Mets overtake a
Braves team weakened by the loss of their top reliever.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Schultz, the Braves' public relations director, said the
Braves offices were ``swamped'' with calls on Wednesday. The
offices were closed Thursday at the start of the team's annual
holiday vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most were very, very negative,'' Schultz said. ``We had people
calling and identifying themselves as gay or Spanish or
Asian-American. Half a dozen or so threatened to cancel their
season tickets. A lot of people said they'd never watch a Braves
game on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Glavine, one of the Braves' veteran starting pitchers, and
Brian Jordan, their right fielder, criticized Rocker on Atlanta
talk shows. Leo Mazzone, the Braves pitching coach, said he should
be traded.
</P>
<P>
   Hank Aaron, the club's senior vice president, said he was
sickened by Rocker's remarks and questioned how Rocker could remain
in baseball, not just with the Braves. About 15 people protested
outside Turner Field on Thursday, urging the Braves to dump the
25-year-old reliever.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Bill Campbell of Atlanta tried to distance Rocker and his
comments from the city and the team when he said ``we regard
ourselves as a city of great tolerance. This is the birthplace of
Dr. King; the civil rights movement sprang from the loins of
Atlanta.'' He called it more of a ``personal tragedy'' for Rocker
that was ``largely the product of ignorance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have said they will address the issue when their
executives return from vacation after the start of the new year.
They plan to meet with Rocker, discuss the dilemma and decide on a
course of action.
</P>
<P>
   Not that most of the protesters care, but from a baseball
standpoint, the situation could prove extremely troublesome for the
Braves. If the Braves have had one problem through their dominance
of the National League in the 1990s, it has been their inability to
come up with a consistent closer.
</P>
<P>
   They thought they finally had one in Mark Wohlers, a young
hard-throwing right-hander, who gained 25 saves in 1995, 39 in 96
and 33 in 97. But then Wohlers inexplicably lost his ability to
throw strikes and wild-pitched himself out of the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   To replace Wohlers, the Braves tried Kerry Ligtenberg, a rookie
right-hander, who secured saves in 30 of 34 save situations in
1998. He was the first National League rookie with 30 saves in a
dozen years. But Ligtenberg did not have a chance to add to that
success last season. In spring training he tore the medial
collateral ligament in his right elbow and underwent ``Tommy John''
ligament transplant surgery.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the Braves came up with Rocker, a left-hander in his
second season with the team. He was eager and he capitalized on the
opportunity he received. He earned 38 saves, one short of Wohlers'
club record of 39, including three against the Mets in a critical
September series.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After weeks of complaining that Schools Chancellor
Rudy Crew had lost his focus and slipped into deep ambivalence
about his job, the New York City Board of Education voted 4-3 on
Thursday to end Crew's tenure when his contract expires next June.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Crew said he was so disgusted by the board's action
that he might leave sooner, raising the possibility that the
nation's largest school system, with 1.1. million children, would
be left rudderless at a time when it is under enormous pressure to
introduce tough new graduation standards and raise test scores.
</P>
<P>
   The votes to oust Crew were cast by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's
three allies on the board and by Terri Thomson, the Queens member
who in recent months has acted as the swing vote.
</P>
<P>
   Those members said after the vote that they had been
particularly troubled by Crew's behavior in recent weeks. They
cited his persistent refusal to reveal whether he wanted to stay
on, his shrugging off a state report charging widespread attendance
fraud, and his jibe last week that a city councilman was ``too
short'' to criticize him.
</P>
<P>
   But a supporter of Crew, William C. Thompson, the board
president, said after the vote that ``the mayor's fingerprints are
on this'' and that it was ``a recipe for disaster for this school
system.''
</P>
<P>
   For Crew, Thursday's vote, which took place 10 minutes into a
closed board meeting that lasted less than an hour, ended a
four-year tenure marked by several major accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Crew persuaded the state Legislature to curtail the power of the
city's 32 local school boards, giving the chancellor more say over
the appointment of local superintendents, ended the automatic
promotion of failing students and helped negotiate a deal to end
lifelong job protection for principals.
</P>
<P>
   But standardized test scores have largely remained flat under
Crew's leadership, and New York City still lags behind the rest of
the state on graduation rates, spending per pupil and the
percentage of students taking and passing tough new Regents tests.
</P>
<P>
   Crew benefited from strong political support for much of his
tenure, but his close relationship with Giuliani deteriorated last
April after he fiercely and successfully resisted the mayor's plan
to experiment with school vouchers. In May, Giuliani infuriated
Crew again by persuading a majority of board members to reject the
chancellor's $11 billion school construction plan, handing Crew his
first defeat by the board since it hired him in October 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Crew kept a low profile on Thursday, staying inside his home in
Brooklyn Heights with his four grown children, who were visiting
for the holidays. He issued a long, at times emotional statement
that did not address the vote at all, but alluded to his battle
with Giuliani over vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   In the statement, Crew said that he had realized last spring
that ``it might be impossible to restore the solidarity that marked
my first three years as chancellor.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has not publicly criticized Crew in recent months, but
he has frequently complained that the school system is a failure
and has refused to say whether Crew should remain on the job. But
one person close to the Giuliani administration said on Thursday
that the mayor had planned to support a yearlong extension for Crew
because Giuliani was presumably running for the Senate next year,
and he did not want to face the political repercussions of ousting
a popular black chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   But the person close to the administration, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said that Giuliani's anger at Crew boiled
over this week after Crew made a last-minute request for a raise
and a pension supplement. Crew already makes $245,000 a year,
compared with $195,000 for Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   The board members voting not to renew Crew's contract were Ms.
Thomson, Deputy Mayor Ninfa Segarra, Jerry Cammarata of Staten
Island and Irene H. Impellizeri of Brooklyn. Voting for him were
William Thompson, of Brooklyn, Dr. Irving S. Hamer Jr. of Manhattan
and Dr. Sandra E. Lerner of the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The board had a deadline of Jan. 1 to tell Crew whether they
wanted to extend his contract, but William Thompson and the other
members said in recent weeks that they needed to know whether Crew
truly wanted to stay before making a decision. Early last week,
Crew finally told Thompson that he wanted to stay for two or even
three years, and he asked Thompson to work out the details of a new
contract with his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Crew's aides said that when he asked for the extension, he also
requested a pension supplement worth twice his annual salary, or
nearly $500,000. Ms. Segarra, one of Giuliani's two appointees to
the board and one of Crew's harshest critics, said after the vote
on Thursday that the chancellor had also requested a raise and that
those last-minute demands were ``the straw that broke the camel's
back.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TYSONS CORNER, Va. _ Pat Buchanan styles himself lately as
``that troll still waiting out there under the bridge,'' hoping for
political magic to strike his impish presidential candidacy as a
Reform Party insurgent.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this troll's campaign along the third-party route is
hardly that lyrical. It is an arduous slog, state by state, into
the arcane thicket of a party whose organizations in 21 states are
the withered branches from the moneyed taproot of Ross Perot. Each
has its own cadre of political mavericks often wary of an intruder
like Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, Buchanan field workers are finding rules and
meetings of the Reform Party suddenly being altered at the approach
of his organizers. Buchanan strategists say they have found no sign
of organized opposition in the states where the actual nomination
must be won, despite all the aggressive sound bites and media
coverage of his chief antagonists, Donald Trump and Gov. Jesse
Ventura of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a whole new universe, as basic a form of politics as
anything I've ever seen in 20 years in the business,'' said Bay
Buchanan, the candidate's sister and field general. ``That's what
so refreshing about it: Guys trying to outwit you in numbers you
can deal with, not the Bush machine pumping in millions and buying
support by the busload.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather, this is the sort of campaign where one canny Buchanan
opponent, outnumbered at a meeting, drove off and returned with
carloads of homeless people newly enrolled as Reform stalwarts.
``We countered that by going to our people _ a bunch of Catholic
parishioners we found building a new rectory for their pastor,''
said Tim Haley, Buchanan's political director, who insisted that
anxiety within the party about Buchanan seemed to be easing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's a stealth campaign _ very stealthy,'' Buchanan said
of the opposition as he employed Perot's past specialist in state
election laws, Matt Sawyer, a lawyer from Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   With the Reform Party already on the ballot in 21 states,
Buchanan's task, carried out in the shadow of the major parties'
cycle of primary contests, is to impress Reform loyalists by
organizing the other 29 states for his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, he is about to launch a painstaking petition
campaign to gather 800,000 certified signatures across those 29
states, a six-month drive that will cost more than $2 million for
the hiring of professional canvassers.
</P>
<P>
   In the 21 states where the Reform Party is already on the
ballet, Buchanan operatives are trying to put their people in
power. But they are finding that each state has its own peculiar
set of abstruse, often shifting regulations for a candidate's
entry, leaving even a gifted troll facing a national political game
of Chutes and Ladders.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times we hear about a state meeting but they've changed the
rules by the time we arrive,'' said Ms. Buchanan, who has a network
tracking the obscure doings of Reform organizations. ``They'll say
the meeting's at 11, but it's really at 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, that's human nature, the instinct for
self-preservation,'' she said, grateful for the tricks that she
learned from such masters as Lee Atwater, a former strategist of
the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you finally pinpoint there's a meeting and find out in
which hotel, you make sure to call the hotel to double-check and
you ask what the capacity of the meeting room is,'' she said,
explaining a time-honored tactic. ``Then you know how many people
to have there to dominate the meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Haley is working from assorted state rule books bristling with
restrictions. In Massachusetts, he cautions, an entire roster of
legitimate petitioners can be rejected if someone has
absent-mindedly put check marks on the document pages. He now knows
that each Reform signatory in West Virginia must be formally told
not to partake in anyone else's campaign or the entire petition
roster fails. Texas and North Carolina are the toughest challenges,
needing more than 50,000 certified signatures.
</P>
<P>
   In one skirmish, the New Hampshire Reform leaders suddenly
canceled an organizing meeting as Buchanan supporters approached,
rescheduling the gathering two weeks later but creating a rule that
attendees must be in the party at least a month to participate.
</P>
<P>
   The result was the creation of a larger rival Granite State
Reform Party by Buchanan's ``pitchfork brigade,'' loyalists from
his Republican primary runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing our best not to intimidate,'' Haley added,
emphasizing that he talks not of a party putsch but of a
professional operation dedicated to bolstering cooperative state
leaders. ``I think they're less squeamish after we leave,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of progress included success by Buchanan supporters in
shifting the meeting of Texas Reformers from Dallas, the party
hotbed, to Houston, where there are more Buchanan supporters. Even
more encouraging, Ventura supporters were rebuffed in Minnesota
when they tried to introduce a one-year party membership
requirement to derail the Buchanan campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as they decipher each twist and turn, the Buchanan
organizers know they must endure the ultimate Catch-22 in the
national Reform Party's complex set of convention rules next
August. It is the rule that allows two-thirds of the 590 delegates
to suddenly introduce an 11th-hour candidate on the floor despite
the results of all the preceding months of caucus and primary
struggles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that crazy,'' Ms. Buchanan said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Other strategists say the antidote lies in the two ways Buchanan
can get his delegates into the convention hall: either as formal
Reform Party representatives more susceptible to the intrigues of
party leaders, or as independent delegates committed to Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   The expectation is that Buchanan forces will organize perhaps
four of the 29 targeted states within the Reform Party, while
protecting their strength within the other 25 states by organizing
as independent delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, there is a wild-card party procedure by which
anyone in the nation can enroll and vote _ by e-mail message, fax,
the manner is not fully clear _ in choosing the nominee. This will
require a full-court alert for the more than 100,000 ``pitchfork
brigadeers'' on the Buchanan list of supporters from past
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frightening,'' Ms. Buchanan admitted in summarizing the
hairpin turnings of the Reform route. ``But so far, we don't find
anyone else on the road out there,'' she said of her brother's
intended path from troll to nominee.

PLANS HASTENED FOR START OF TRADING IN NASDAQ JAPAN 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Association of Securities Dealers is speeding up
its plans for an electronic stock market in Japan that will promote
cross-trading of United States and Japanese stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In an announcement planned for Friday, Nasdaq Japan, a
partnership between the NASD and Softbank Corp. of Japan, will
describe a deal that could result in some new Japanese stocks being
traded in the United States as early as next September. Previously,
Nasdaq Japan was not expected to be open for trading until the
fourth quarter of 2000 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, the Osaka Securities Exchange will provide
Nasdaq Japan with back-office services like clearing and settling
of trades, as well as surveillance of suspicious or unusual trading
activity. In return, Osaka will get a share of the profits
generated from trading on Nasdaq Japan, although Osaka has not
decided whether to buy a stake in the exchange. This agreement will
speed up the introduction of Nasdaq Japan by allowing trading to
begin on Osaka's current computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the NASD, the parent of the Nasdaq market in the
United States, will build a computer platform that will link Nasdaq
Japan to the original Nasdaq market, as well as a planned Nasdaq
Europe. The Japan-U.S. connection will represent the first concrete
part of an ambitious NASD plan for a single 24-hour global stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the association hopes to interlink ``pools of
liquidity, so U.S. companies can be exposed to pools of investors
outside the U.S. and non-U.S. companies can be exposed to investors
in the U.S.,'' Frank G. Zarb, the chairman of the association,
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq Japan will open in stages. The first stocks to be traded
on the new market will be Japanese initial public offerings. By
September 2000, U.S. investors will be able to trade Japanese
public offerings that meet listing standards on the original
Nasdaq. By the end of 2000, big U.S. Nasdaq companies like
Microsoft and Intel will be available for Japanese investors to
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq's move toward 24-hour trading is proceeding even though
the NASD, and regulators have not fully resolved the vital issue of
when companies will disclose important information like earnings
releases and takeovers to investors in a world of continuous
trading.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, companies have made major announcements before or
after the close of trading so that all interested investors and
analysts are apprised of the news before trading resumes in their
stocks. But Zarb acknowledged that the NASD remained unsure what
model would replace that system.

A SHOT OF THE ONE THE BABE `CALLED' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Neb., Wyo.)  (rk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harold Warp attended one major league baseball game in his life,
and it was Game 3 of the 1932 World Series. Warp was a businessman
living in Chicago who loved collecting artifacts of the past and
filming his experiences to show to his family back in Nebraska. So
he toted his 16-millimeter camera to Wrigley Field that Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Nice choice.
</P>
<P>
   Warp wasn't an artiste, but in his jiggly style, he filmed one
of baseball's legendary sequences: Babe Ruth gesturing in a way
that made some witnesses believe he was pointing to a spot in the
outfield where he would slug a home run.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth then hammered a solo shot off the Cubs' Charlie Root that
the film shows, for the first time, landing in faraway center
field. Then, Ruth rounds the bases, making mocking gestures to the
bench jockeys on the Cubs who were riding him mercilessly.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Ruth actually called his shot has been a subject of
debate for more than six decades. And now, as millennium lists have
proliferated, the spotlight has been shined on the century's great
moments in sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he made a gesture, to indicate `I'm going to hit
one,''' Robert Creamer, the author of ``Babe,'' considered the
definitive Ruth biography, said Thursday. ``But he did that a lot.
It doesn't matter if he's pointing to a spot. He did something. He
challenged them. He gestured. He stuck it to the Cubs and he loved
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Warp's film took its place among the many reels of family
doings, and few members of the large Warp clan, who assembled at
annual reunions in Minden, Neb., gave much thought to the
significance of the ancient footage, James Jacobs, Warp's
great-great-nephew, said.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1993 reunion, a relative videotaped the films as they
were projected on a meeting room wall in a motel owned by Warp. The
old man was then in his 90s, yet he provided detailed
extemporaneous narration of 30 years of celluloid family history.
Jacobs was enchanted to see his grandfather, at age 8 or 9, goofing
for the camera as he walked off the porch of a house with 30 or 40
other relatives.
</P>
<P>
   When the Ruth footage was played for the family, Jacobs said
Thursday, ``You could hear Harold say, `This is Wrigley Field,
there's Lou Gehrig, there's Babe Ruth.' But he wasn't a big fan.''
In 1994, Warp died.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, Jacobs' great-aunt, knowing that Jacobs worked at
a television station, asked him to edit the tape in a professional
manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody could tell the family history like Harold,'' Jacobs
said.
</P>
<P>
   But each time Jacobs watched the tape, the more he realized he
had a historic artifact. He researched the incident and wondered if
his great-great-uncle's film had solved the ``called shot''
mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs felt the film should be in the Baseball Hall of Fame. He
showed it to members of the Society for American Baseball Research,
who did not doubt its authenticity. Ruth played only two games in
Wrigley Field with the Yankees, and the film clearly showed Ruth
swatting a home run at the ballpark. Jacobs gave a copy of his tape
to a society member who works at the Hall of Fame. But Jacobs still
had no deal.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that Jacobs did not own the film and felt
reluctant to give it to anyone without the approval of Warp's son,
his third cousin, who is also named Harold but is nicknamed Skip.
</P>
<P>
   Despite letters and calls, Jacobs said, he got little feedback
from Skip Warp. ``I was frustrated,'' said Jacobs, who lives in
Cheyenne, Wyo. ``I knew he was very busy and this wasn't that
important to him. I told him about the people I was talking to. I
was trying to convince him this is a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Jacobs' luck began to change. Online at ESPN.com, he
read a request for unusual footage and home movies from ESPN's
``Sports Century'' series, which was down to its last four
biographies of the century's top 50 North American athletes _ Ruth,
Muhammad Ali, Jim Brown and Michael Jordan. The final order will
not be known until Sunday's finale at 5 p.m. EST on ABC, when Nos.
1 and 2 will be named. ESPN will carry Nos. 3 and 4 Friday night at
10.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs' first e-mail to ESPN was ignored. A second one, routed
through a co-worker's friend at ESPN, found Mark Shapiro, the
series' coordinating producer. ``I called him at 11 o'clock Tuesday
night and told him I'd have a courier at his house in 45 minutes,''
said Shapiro, who subsequently made a deal with Skip Warp.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, Jacobs spoke to his cousin. ``His feedback was
positive, but I don't know if he was thrilled that I went ahead
without him,'' Jacobs said. ``But he realized the film belongs
here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports Century'' was the perfect place because of the quality
of its programs and its reputation for archival research. The Ruth
biography was not completed and Shapiro had already planned to open
it with a look at the ``called shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro said, ``For a guy who's so mythic, we went with the
moment that symbolized that the most.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro already had another 16-millimeter amateur movie of the
home run taken by Matt Kandle Sr., which surfaced in 1994. A fan
blocked Kandle's view as Ruth rounded third base, so the Warp
footage completes the circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the home movies provide telling evidence that Ruth's
gestures were directed at the Cubs' dugout, not to the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not pointing to the outfield,'' Shapiro said. ``He's
turning left and yelling at the Cubs.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ruth might have gestured and boasted to Charlie Grimm's
Cubs that he would hit a home run. He had already hit one that day.
</P>
<P>
   And the legend lives.

DEMOCRATS CRITICIZE BUSH AS OUT OF TOUCH ON POVERTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (pr) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Gov. George W. Bush's skeptical response to a federal
report detailing hunger in Texas has brought criticism from
Democrats who say Bush is out of touch with poverty in his state.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Agriculture, in a study titled ``Measuring
Food Security in the United States,'' found that 5 percent of Texas
households had reported suffering from hunger from 1996 through
1998. Only Oregon had reported a higher percentage, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the report that children in Texas are going hungry.
Where?'' Bush said earlier this week in an interview with The Fort
Worth Star-Telegram. ``You'd think the governor would have heard if
there are pockets of hunger in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats quickly criticized Bush, who has campaigned for the
Republican presidential nomination as a ``compassionate
conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Democratic National Committee distributed the
comments to reporters. In Texas, state Rep. Elliott Naishtat, a
Democrat who is chairman of the House Committee on Human Services,
issued a statement Thursday saying that he was ``appalled'' at the
governor's comments and that ``there are massive numbers of people
who go hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Could it be the governor also doesn't know that Texas ranks at
or near the bottom in every recognized national poverty-related
category?'' Naishtat said in the statement. ``Perhaps so.''
</P>
<P>
   A Bush campaign spokesman, Scott McClellan, noted that Bush's
remarks to The Star-Telegram included a fuller comment in which the
governor said, ``I want to know the facts. I would like for the
Department of Agriculture to show us who, where are they, and we'll
respond.''
</P>
<P>
   McClellan said Bush signed a measure earlier this year approving
$2 million for nutrition education and outreach efforts to needy
families. One of the governor's priorities, the spokesman said, has
been to mobilize religious groups and charities to help the poor.
Bush is proposing tax benefits for people who donate money to such
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is committed to doing something about hunger,'' McClellan
said.
</P>
<P>
   After a campaign appearance in Manchester, N.H., on Monday, Bush
was asked whether he had been surprised by the hunger report.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there are some people who are hungry,'' he replied.
``I don't believe 5 percent of the children in my state are hungry,
and if they are, we'll fix it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'm surprised. I'm surprised all of a sudden a report
floats out of Washington, D.C., as I'm launching my campaign for
president. There seems to be a lot of reports to be coming out of
Washington, D.C., these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Celia Hagert, nutrition policy analyst for the Center for Public
Policy Priorities in Austin, a nonprofit organization focusing on
issues affecting low-income Texans, said statistics compiled by
America's Second Harvest, a network of food banks, showed that food
banks in Texas distributed 25.9 percent more food in 1999 than in
1996. The amount was 118.6 million pounds, up from 94.2 million
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Pruitt, executive director of the North Texas Food Bank in
Dallas, said demand at the food bank had increased about 12 percent
over last year while donations had increased by 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pruitt said the people seeking food were different from a
decade ago, when the needy were mostly the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen not only the need increase but the whole face of the
hungry change,'' she said. ``Now it's working people. They're
employed, and they cannot feed their families.''

<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Before leaving for the winter meetings in early December, Astros
general manager Gerry Hunsicker classified any player not under
contract beyond the 2000 season as a ``trade possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   In the span of eight days, possibilities have become realities.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros unloaded two more high-priced veterans Thursday,
shipping Cy Young Award runner-up Mike Hampton and right fielder
Derek Bell to the New York Mets for center fielder Roger Cedeno,
righthander Octavio Dotel and minor-league lefthander Kyle Kessel.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 15, the Astros traded center fielder Carl Everett to the
Boston Red Sox for two minor-leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   All three ex-Astros _ Hampton, Bell and Everett _ were set to
become free agents after the 2000 season, and each will command
salaries of at least $5 million in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing they would lose Hampton, the lefthander who led the
National League with 22 wins in 1999, to free agency, Hunsicker
said the Astros decided to trade now rather than run the risk of
losing him later without compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind there was a lot of interest in Mike, but we
certainly weren't in the mode to just trade him for the sake of
trading him,'' Hunsicker said. ``If we were going to trade him, it
had to make sense from a baseball standpoint. We certainly needed
to receive something back valuable enough to make it work from a
baseball standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno, 25, will move into the starting center-field spot
vacated by Everett and may solve the Astros' search for a No. 2
hitter. His acquisition will allow Richard Hidalgo, coming off knee
surgery, to replace Bell in right field.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno, a switch hitter, hit .313 with 36 RBIs in 1999, his
first full season in the majors after spending parts of four
seasons with the Los Angeles Dodgers. He made $487,500 last season
and is eligible for salary arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy has world-class speed,'' Hunsicker said of Cedeno,
who was second in the National League with 66 stolen bases. ``He's
among the fastest in the majors. It gives (Hidalgo) an opportunity
to get back in the groove instead of tracking down balls in the
massive center field that we'll have in the new ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   Dotel, 24, is a highly regarded prospect who is expected to move
into the starting rotation, likely as the No. 4 or 5 man. In his
first shot at the majors in 1999, he was 8-3 with a 5.38 ERA in 14
starts and five relief appearances.
</P>
<P>
   He made the league minimum of $270,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets offered Cedeno and Dotel to Seattle earlier this month
in talks involving Ken Griffey Jr. The proposed deal collapsed when
Griffey told the Mariners he would exercise his right to block all
deals except one that would send him to Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``As opposed to the Carl Everett trade that was focused on the
future, we wanted to make sure if we were going to trade Hampton,
we got some talent back, players to help us compete and win in the
year 2000,'' Hunsicker said. ``I really believe we accomplished
that with this trade. They are major-league-ready players.''
</P>
<P>
   And they come at a considerably lower price.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros have made no secret of their intent to try to pare a
player payroll that reached $56 million in 1999. By trading
Hampton, Bell and Everett, they will save approximately $16 million
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros indicated they may attempt to sign a free-agent
pitcher with the extra money.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things this trade does give us is some flexibility
budget-wise,'' Hunsicker said. ``We've gone from a position where
we were pushing up against a limit _ and quite frankly over where
we wanted to be _ to one where we can now do some things.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, who will earn $5.75 million this season and be eligible
for free agency following the 2000 season, was 22-4 with a 2.90 ERA
in 1999, finishing second to Arizona's Randy Johnson in voting for
the NL Cy Young Award. Down the stretch, Hampton won 11 straight
decisions to help lead the Astros to a third straight NL Central
Division title.
</P>
<P>
   He told the Astros on Dec. 15 he was not interested in
discussing a contract extension and would test the free-agent
market a year from now.
</P>
<P>
   ``His representative called and indicated he would rather play
out the final year and explore the market,'' Hunsicker said. ``That
hit us between the eyes. I was shocked and didn't see it coming. In
my mind, that forced our hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were more than glad to acquire Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I heard Mike  was available, I thought
it was a ploy to get a lot of offers of players going to Houston,''
Mets manager Bobby Valentine said. ``He's one of the best offensive
players hitting in the ninth spot in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   The departure of Bell, 31, was less of a surprise. The Astros
have openly shopped him for the past two seasons, finding little
interest because of Bell's high price tag and sporadic play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided internally that we were not going retain him past
the 2000 season,'' Hunsicker said.
</P>
<P>
   Bell lost his starting job during the final week of the season
after hitting .236 with 12 homers and 66 RBIs. A year earlier, Bell
hit .314 with a career-high 22 homers and 108 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to play hard and make them wish they hadn't traded
me,'' said Bell, who will make $5 million in 2000. ``I'm going to
make Houston eat its words.''
</P>
<P>
   After trading Hampton, one of the most popular Astros, and
Everett for younger talent, Hunsicker expects the initial public
view to be unfavorable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've reiterated many times that the key to the success of
this franchise is the continuation of blending veteran players with
young players,'' Hunsicker said. ``With salaries escalating to the
levels they currently are for premium players, clubs are looking at
situations where you only have a handful of real premium players
and you're going to be even more dependent on the young people
coming up, either through your system or via trades.''

NEWHALL LAND MAY SEE RECORD EARNINGS
</HEADLINE>
 -LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A recent major land sale is expected to thrust The
Newhall Land &AMP; Farming Company to record earnings for 1999, with
profits estimated as high as $90 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company's strong performance was bolstered by the recent
sale of the 36,000-acre Suey Ranch that straddles Santa Barbara and
San Luis Obispo counties. That sale is expected to add nearly $22
million to fourth-quarter earnings for the Valencia-based developer
north of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company expects 1999 to be the best year in its history,
achieving new records in revenues, net income and net income per
unit,'' Thomas L. Lee, Newhall Land's chairman and chief executive
officer, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Suey Ranch sale will add an estimated 70 cents per
shareholder unit, projected to bring fourth-quarter, per-unit
earnings to as much as $1.85. Last year, per-unit earnings were
$1.86, up 58 cents from 1997's rate of $1.28.
</P>
<P>
   ``The area is performing very strongly for them,'' said
Katherine Flores, an analyst at Sutro &AMP; Co. in Los Angeles, the
only research firm that actively tracks the publicly traded Newhall
Land. ``The demand for land is very strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Flores said that closing the sale of the Suey Ranch was
particularly important to the company's year-end bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   The major sale in the fourth quarter gives Newhall Land its
third straight year of increased profits and eighth straight year
of increased per-unit earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said they expect the trend to continue,
predicting a new record in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Year-end results show record earnings across the board
</P>
<P>
   Newhall Land's residential, commercial and industrial divisions
all logged successes.
</P>
<P>
   To date, approximately 113 acres of commercial and industrial
land sales have closed escrow, including sales of 45 acres in the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Residential lots closing escrow in the fourth quarter totaled
544, including 250 lots in the Bridgeport Lake Community under
construction and 294 unimproved lots in the Hasley Hills, just
north of Valencia.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 891 residential lots were sold this year, including
some valued at more than $1 million per net acre, a company-record
high.
</P>
<P>
   Much of last year's performance was credited to the second
quarter $111 million sale of the Valencia Marketplace to Samuel S.
Mevorach, a private investor.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that 1999 sales prices across all real estate
segments exceeded 1998 appraised values by 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the coming year, company officials expect to generate
approximately $200 million cash from a combination of land sales,
as well as recurring commercial and agricultural income.
</P>
<P>
   Newhall Land also is looking at selling 700 residential lots in
the North River area of Valencia.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial and industrial land sales are targeted at
approximately 100 acres and will be concentrated in the Valencia
Commerce Center and Valencia Town Center areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next year should also be a great year for them,'' Flores said.
``They're looking to sell commercial land portfolios and pushing
land sales.''

   John Paton Davies, a leading diplomat who was among the ``old
China hands'' driven from the State Department after Sen. Joseph
McCarthy questioned their loyalty and labeled them Communist
sympathizers in the 1950s, died Thursday at his home in Asheville,
N.C. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Davies and about a dozen of the country's most eminent China
scholars and diplomats found themselves accused of having ``lost
China'' after Mao Tse-tung's Communist forces defeated Chiang
Kai-shek's Nationalists, which were supported by the American
government, in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   In his attacks, McCarthy was echoing the indignant arguments of
the China lobby, as the powerful American backers of Chiang
Kai-shek were known. Among those accused of ``selling out'' Chiang
were several diplomats, including Oliver Edmund Clubb, John Carter
Vincent and John Stewart Service, and academics like Owen Lattimore
and John King Fairbank.
</P>
<P>
   But of all those Americans whose careers were blighted in the
hunt for scapegoats, Davies may be one of the most poignant
examples. He was a decorated hero of World War II destined,
according to his superiors, for high rank in the State Department.
He was regarded as a tough foe of Stalinism whose World War II
reports from China were much concerned with the threat of Soviet
domination. In 1950 he had even proposed that the United States,
with its superiority in nuclear weapons, engage in a ``preventive
showdown'' with the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on Nov. 5, 1954, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles
dismissed him from the Foreign Service, maintaining that Davies had
``demonstrated a lack of judgment, discretion and reliability.''
According to ``The China Hands,'' a book by E.J. Kahn published in
1972, Davies was then told that if he ever needed a recommendation
for a new job, the secretary of state would be happy to provide
one.
</P>
<P>
   The dismissal took place four years after McCarthy began his
pursuit of the State Department's Far Eastern division, describing
it in a Senate speech as the home base of ``individuals who are
loyal to the ideals and designs of Communism rather than those of
the free, God-fearing half of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   As he stepped up his accusations that the Eisenhower
administration was sheltering Communist sympathizers, McCarthy
first asserted that he had a list of 205 State Department policy
shapers who were ``known to the secretary of state as being members
of the Communist Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Later he mentioned a list of 57 names, and a list of 81. Pressed
to identify anyone, he declared that Lattimore, a Johns Hopkins
University professor who specialized in Mongolian studies and had
no official ties to the State Department, was ``the top Russian spy
in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   When Davies and his colleagues were accused, it was noted that
many were named John, which gave rise to a bitter riddle: Who was
responsible for losing China? John S. Service, John Carter Vincent,
John Paton Davies and John Kai-shek.
</P>
<P>
   In hearings that lasted for years, several of the China hands,
including Davies, Service and Vincent, were accused by Gen. Patrick
J. Hurley, Roosevelt's special envoy and then ambassador to China
in 1944-45, of sabotaging his efforts to prevent the collapse of
the Nationalist government. Among other things, they were attacked
for having known and met with Chinese Communist leaders.
</P>
<P>
   One part of the case against Davies arose from his role in the
Tawny Pipit Affair. The tawny pipit, a bird that sings loudly in
flight, was the code name for a covert intelligence-gathering
operation contemplated after the fall of the Chinese Nationalist
government in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   After the lowering of the Bamboo Curtain when the Communists
took over, Davies was delegated by George Kennan, director of
policy planning in the State Department, to attend a meeting with
Defense and Central Intelligence representativays to obtain
intelligence from China. Davies suggested that approaches be made
to half a dozen Americans friendly with the Chinese Communist
leaders, with an eye toward enlisting them as double agents.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was never pursued, but in 1952 Davies' critics
contended that he had been trying to infiltrate the U.S.
intelligence network with Communist sympathizers so they might
eventually subvert their country in support of China.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning by a Senate subcommittee on internal security,
Davies parried questions while adhering to his understanding that
anything involving the CIA had to be kept secret. Later,
subcommittee members tried to charge Davies with perjury on the
basis of his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Kennan, who had worked with Davies in Moscow, strongly defended
him. In his ``Memoirs 1950-1963,'' Kennan noted that Davies had
originally run afoul of Hurley by trying to warn him against Soviet
perfidy, and largely as a result of the general's charges had
suffered ``years of harassment and humiliation.'' This, Kennan
said, reflected ``the nightmarish quality'' of that time, and he
described Davies as ``a man of broad, sophisticated and skeptical
political understanding, without an ounce of pro-Communist
sympathies, and second to no one in his devotion to the interests
of our government.''

SWISS AIRCRAFT DEAL TO CREATE 6,000 JOBS IN PALMDALE REGION OVER 5
YEARS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A deal to bring a major Swiss aircraft
maintenance facility to Palmdale Regional Airport north of Los
Angeles will create 6,000 jobs for the region in the next five
years, representing the biggest foreign investment of the 1990s in
California and a comeback for the local economy, California Gov.
Gray Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal is another indication that California is back,''
Davis said Thursday at a news conference at Los Angeles
International Airport where the agreement was officially announced.
``This is a phenomenal day for California and a phenomenal day for
the Antelope Valley (region). We expect this project to generate $1
billion in state tax revenues over the next 20 years, and that's a
conservative figure.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the jobs created at SR Technics, a subsidiary of
Swissair, are expected to average $50,000 per year in salary, and
would likely go to local residents left unemployed by the massive
downsizing in the aerospace industry over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Incentives from the state include $79 million in tax subsidies,
Davis said, in return for the Swiss company hiring locally for the
facility which is expected to open in June.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 jobs are expected by the time the facility opens,
with another 5,000 jobs by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Looking beyond the next five years, SR Technics President Hans
Ulrich Beyeler said the facility has a total job capacity of 7,000
positions, and the company hopes to fill at least that many in the
next decade, becoming the largest employer in the Antelope Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just another facility,'' Beyeler said. ``This is a
building block in our long-term global strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft maintenance and restoration facility will be
located on Site 9 of the airport, land being leased by Los Angeles
World Airports to Boeing Corp. where military aircraft were built
during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing was also a key player in the deal, agreeing to contract
with SR Technics to convert 57 DC-10 passenger jets to MD-10 cargo
freighters at the Palmdale site.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is part of an ongoing effort by Los Angeles to lure
commercial air carriers and commuter airlines to the airport, city
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement is a major milestone in my long-standing
commitment to a regional solution to meet our ever-growing air
transportation needs,'' Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan said in a
written statement Thursday. ``It follows the joint cooperation
initiative Los Angeles has with the city of Palmdale.''
</P>
<P>
   John Agoglia, president of the Los Angeles Airport Commission,
said the new facility will also help in the negotiations to bring
high-speed rail transportation to Palmdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it definitely shows the airport to be a marketable
asset, and will play a vital role in bringing better public
transportation to the area,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Los Angeles will also contribute improvements to the
site, said Deputy Mayor Rocky Delgadillo, including a $12.5 million
fire sprinkler system for the two main hangars on the site.
</P>
<P>
   City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, a longtime supporter of
increasing activity at Palmdale to relieve some of the traffic at
LAX, praised the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is living proof, as I've contended for years,'' she said,
``that with some serious marketing efforts, Palmdale Airport can
really take off.''
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Contreras, the head of the local AFL-CIO, said the county
was in dire need of the influx of new jobs, most of which will be
held by union members, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have an agreement yet, but we're going to make sure
the jobs are union,'' he said.

 UNDATED: our government.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like several other American figures in the Chinese drama, John
Paton Davies Jr. was born in China _ in Kiating, Sichuan province,
on April 6, 1908. His parents were Baptist missionaries.
</P>
<P>
   He spent two years at the University of Wisconsin, another at
Yenching University outside Beijing and a fourth at Columbia, where
he graduated in 1931. He joined the Foreign Service and returned to
China the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Stationed successively in Kunming, Beijing, Mukden and Hankou,
Davies spent the next decade observing the advance of the Japanese
armies into China, protecting U.S. interests and eventually
evacuating U.S. civilians. In Hankou, then the Nationalists'
capital, he met the leading Communists, witnessed the rout of the
Nationalist forces by the Japanese and saw atrocities committed by
Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   When Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, Davies was in
Washington, on the State Department's China desk. He seized an
opportunity to join the staff of Gen. Joseph Stilwell, who had just
been named commander of the China-Burma-India theater.
</P>
<P>
   Stilwell's forces suffered defeat in Burma; after leading a
painful retreat, Stilwell was given responsibility for organizing
the defense of India and China. Davies served as his chief
diplomatic aide, political adviser, interpreter, sometime press
spokesman and Dutch uncle (occasionally warning the tough soldier,
known as Vinegar Joe, to restrain his candor and optimism).
</P>
<P>
   Tensions quickly developed between the Americans and the Chiang
government, then based in Chongqing. In his reports, Davies
expressed fear that China was headed toward a civil war that the
Communists would win, and that American support of Chiang against
Mao would drive the Chinese Communists toward the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Long afterward, he said he had mistaken the Communists' evident
popularity with the idea that their ascent to power had something
to do with democracy. He also said he had underestimated the grip
of Maoist ideology in theorizing that the Communists would be open
to American investment. In essence something like this did happen,
but it took another three decades.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 2, 1943, Davies was on a C-46 transport flying to China
from India when an engine failed and all aboard were ordered to
jump.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Sevareid, who was aboard as a radio correspondent,
recounted the story: none of the 17 passengers had ever used a
parachute, and all hesitated. Davies, as the senior official,
jumped first, his attache case stuffed inside his shirt. It took a
month for the group to walk out of the jungle, and according to
Sevareid it was Davies who rallied them when it seemed impossible
to go on. At one point, Sevareid said, Davies gave him his last cup
of water. Davies received the Medal of Freedom.
</P>
<P>
   In summer 1944, an observation group called the Dixie Mission
was sent to the Communist headquarters at Yenan after prodding by
Davies and the U.S. Army. The mission confirmed reports of
Communist strength in the north. Davies made several trips there
and passed along two offers from Mao, one to visit the United
States to discuss further ties and the other to cooperate with a
contemplated U.S. landing on the Japanese-held coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not now abandon Chiang Kai-shek,'' Davies wrote in a
memo on Nov. 15, 1944, ``but we must be realistic. We must not
indefinitely underwrite a politically bankrupt regime. We must make
a determined effort to capture politically the Chinese Communists
rather than allow them to go by default wholly to the Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurley, who at the time accepted Stalin's assurances of support
for Chiang and of disdain for the Chinese Communists, now began to
denounce Davies and his colleagues, saying their criticism of the
Nationalists was meant to undermine his attempt to unify the
various Chinese military forces against the Japanese. Arriving in
Yenan in November 1944, he sent Davies back to Chongqing. Davies
was relieved to obtain a transfer to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow in
January 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Hurley gained the Communists' assent to a coalition with the
Nationalists, but Chiang rejected it, proposing one unacceptable to
the Communists. In August 1945 the Japanese surrendered, and the
opposing Chinese armies raced to take over their sectors in a civil
war in which the United States backed the losing side.

<P>
   Hurley returned to Washington and resigned as ambassador in
November 1945, blaming the China hands, including Davies, for the
failure of his mission. The hunt for those who ``lost China'' was
well under way.
</P>
<P>
   The first victim was Service. The FBI arrested him, accusing him
of espionage in providing classified reports on China to a small
magazine called Amerasia, but he was cleared by a grand jury. He
was then accused of disloyalty on nine more occasions before
finally being dismissed on the ground of ``reasonable doubt'' of
his loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   At the embassy in Moscow, where Davies had been promoted to
first secretary, echoes of Hurley's charges aroused indignant
rebuttals from Ambassador Averell Harriman and Kennan. Secretary of
State James F. Byrnes, on a visit, jestingly asked a Soviet leader
to be nice to Davies because Hurley was calling him a Communist.
</P>
<P>
   From 1947 to 1951, Davies served on the State Department's
policy planning staff, under Kennan. He foresaw the French defeat
in Indochina and urged that the United States avoid getting
involved. Like Kennan he remained suspicious of Moscow, and in one
paper called for a ``preventive showdown'' while the United States
still had a monopoly on atomic bombs.
</P>
<P>
   He was nevertheless a major target of the China lobby, one of
whose stalwarts was another son of missionaries to China, Henry
Luce, founder and publisher of Time magazine. When Time accused
Davies of undercutting Gen. Douglas MacArthur by warning of Chinese
intervention in Korea, Kennan wrote an angry rebuttal.
</P>
<P>
   Assigned to Germany in 1951, Davies was called home in the next
year to testify about the Tawny Pipit Affair. He was cleared of a
Senate subcommittee's perjury charge but was transferred to Lima,
Peru, where he served as charge d'affaires.
</P>
<P>
   Still McCarthy hammered away at him and at Tawny Pipit until, in
late 1954, a special security board ruled that while Davies'
loyalty could not be questioned, his employment was ``not clearly
consistent with the interests of the national security.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies was informally invited to resign, which would have
assured him a pension. He refused. Dulles summoned him and, in a
few words, told him he had been dismissed. It was then that the
secretary offered to provide a recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Davies said nothing, although he later termed the offer
``bizarre,'' because he had been found lacking ``in judgment,
discretion and reliability.'' In a statement he said: ``There has
been enough recrimination. I am not prepared to add to it and
thereby detract from the strength of my country in its mortal
struggle with the Communist enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   He returned to his family in Lima.
</P>
<P>
   In India in 1942, he had married Patricia Grady, a correspondent
for The Washington Post and the daughter of Henry F. Grady, the
first American ambassador to India. She survives, as do their seven
children: Sasha, of White Plains, N.Y.; Tiki, of Washington; John
G., of Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Susan, of Chatham, N.Y.; Jennifer,
of Seattle; Deborah, of London, and Megan, of New Orleans. Also
surviving are a brother, Donald, of State College, Pa., and 11
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had no experience in the woodworking trade, Davies
set up a shop in Lima to design and make furniture. It succeeded,
modestly. He also wrote a weekly column for a local newspaper, and
worked his writings into a book published in 1964, ``Foreign and
Other Affairs.'' In it he took a tough view of American policy in
Latin America, suggesting that Washington show more willingness to
support strong governments.
</P>
<P>
   About this time Davies returned to Washington to, as he put it,
raise his children in a democratic American climate. Friends began
a quiet effort to obtain his official rehabilitation, but it was
not until 1969 that he was granted a government security clearance
to work on a research project on Latin America at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. Even this action was not formally
announced by the State Department, though he did obtain a pension.
</P>
<P>
   Davies and his family then lived for several years in Malaga,
Spain. He and his wife settled in Asheville, N.C., when their
children began attending college.His second book, ``Dragon by the
Tail,'' was both a memoir and a history of Chinese-American
relations from 1931 to 1945. It appeared in 1972, as the Nixon
administration's involvement with China was renewing American
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Davies concluded the book with this thought: ``The truth of the
matter is that China has been since the fall of the Empire a huge
and seductive practical joke. The Western businessmen, missionaries
and educators who had tried to modernize and Christianize it
failed. The Japanese militarists who tried to conquer it failed.
The American government, which tried to democratize and unify it,
failed. The Soviet rulers who tried to insinuate control over it
failed. Chiang failed. Mao failed.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1971 Davies, along with Fairbank and Service, was invited to
testify before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Its
chairman, William Fulbright, welcomed them by saying: ``It is a
very strange turn of fate that you gentlemen, who reported honestly
about conditions, were so persecuted because you were honest about
it. This is a strange thing to occur in what is called a civilized
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, while Davies was still living in Spain, the
American Foreign Service Association held a luncheon at the State
Department in honor of the old China hands. Davies was among those
invited, but he stayed home. He told friends it would have been a
long way to go for lunch.

NEW YORK IS GROUND ZERO, ALL AGREE, BUT FOR FESTIVITY OR FEAR?
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By JANE GROSS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three generations of the Errico family were making
their way through Times Square on Thursday, craning their necks at
the panorama of neon and disagreeing about whether the gridlocked
triangle was tourist heaven or ground zero for possible terrorist
activity on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   The children, riding on their fathers' shoulders, were too young
to have understood the drumbeat of cautionary announcements from
government and law enforcement officials in recent days. Their
fathers _ one a real estate broker from Colorado, the other an
engineer from Maine _ were brashly confident that those warnings
were needless overkill.
</P>
<P>
   But the grandfather, a retiree from Westchester County, N.Y.,
was edgy as the new millennium approached, and edgier still each
time the president, the State Department, the mayor of New York
City or its police chief urged revelers to pay special attention in
public places.
</P>
<P>
   ``By playing it up,'' said the grandfather, Bob Errico,
``they're only scaring people more and giving ideas to the people
who are cuckoo.''
</P>
<P>
   As in the Errico family, there is no consensus in New York, or
in the nation, about whether this New Year's Eve will be just
another midnight gala or a millennial nightmare. But a few things
are clear: In New York and its suburbs there is substantial concern
about the potential for outbreaks of terrorism, particularly at the
traditional celebration in Times Square. Outside New York, by
contrast, people are generally confident that any trouble will take
place too far away to immediately affect their lives.
</P>
<P>
   But in and around New York, even those who were complacent a
week ago found themselves increasingly unnerved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I nervous? Honestly, yes,'' said John Garabieta, a
filmmaker from Rye, N.Y., who is planning to attend a New Year's
Eve party at a Times Square skyscraper. ``It started a few days
ago, when I kept reading things and hearing things on the news.
Everyone's pretending it's not a big deal, but then again they're
making it a big deal. So where I wasn't worried about it before, I
am now.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere was the nervousness more palpable _ or the government
warnings more appreciated _ than at the World Trade Center, where a
1993 terrorist bombing is seared in the memories of witnesses and
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people out there whose only purpose is to hurt us,''
said Faye Black, an administrative assistant who has worked in the
downtown towers for a decade. ``Officials are not scaring people;
they're giving us the reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Catanzaro, a longtime temporary worker there, shuddered at
the memory of ``the helicopters, the smoke, the ambulances'' on the
day of the fatal attack. That dreadful day, she said, was ``a
wake-up call that we live in a city that's a target. There are a
lot of fanatics out there who will take advantage of the
celebration going on in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   In cities or hamlets removed from New York, the epicenter of the
celebration and round-the-clock live television coverage, people
said they felt safer, certain that terrorists would choose a site
that guaranteed them maximum visibility.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, at Faneuil Hall Marketplace, Heather Midgley Douglas
said she thought that ``something is going to happen,'' but not in
her backyard. ``I definitely wouldn't be caught dead in New York in
Times Square,'' she said. ``That would be too good a target.''
</P>
<P>
   Sentiment was similar in the town square of tiny Holly Springs,
Miss. ``You hit a town like this and you're just wiping out a bunch
of hicks,'' said Tina Rhea, whose aunt owns Nadine's City Cafe,
which buzzed with holiday chatter. ``If you're a terrorist and want
to make a statement and you blow a small town like ththe
map, who cares? I mean, what do we have to offer the world besides
good sweet tea and great sweet potato pie?''
</P>
<P>
   Steven E. Roberts, the police chief of Westbrook, Maine, just
north of Portland, was also counting on quiet in his little corner
of the world. But on Thursday, he was sampling the holiday
excitement in Times Square with his wife, daughter and
mother-in-law. Roberts gave a rousing defense of the escalating
warnings coming from New York City officials as the big day
approached.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't business as usual,'' he said, noting that
terrorists ``would get the biggest bang for the buck'' by striking
Times Square. ``This is a unique situation and people can't be
complacent. A healthy degree of fear is fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts added that city officials face a dilemma. They must
reassure would-be partygoers to boost attendance in Times Square
and also remind people that their safety cannot be guaranteed.
``Cops call it `cover your butt,''' he said of the double message.
``But people must make a conscious decision to take a risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Many ordinary citizens, without law enforcement experience,
worried that all the talk of terrorism would increase its
likelihood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every nut watching TV, anybody with a screw loose thinking,
`This could be my claim to fame,' I'm more worried about them than
the actual terrorists,'' said Ivy Herman, a television producer who
was waiting for colleagues in Manhattan's Grand Central Terminal
for their annual holiday lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Herman, like many other people interviewed in the New York
metropolitan area, also doubted the motives of officials issuing
daily warnings. Their goal, she guessed, was to avoid criticism.
``So some family from Wisconsin doesn't say to the mayor, `You said
it would be all right.'''

BEANIE BABIES SUCCESSOR? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVE WALKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although Pokemon rules the mall this Christmas, the Beanie
Babies market hasn't exactly gone soft. &QL; 
Still, the maker of the squishy collectibles has decreed that the
line ends at 264 _ the total of cuddly characters issued since
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning, Beanie Babies collectors and retailers are
watching the World Wide Web for word of the Beanies' successor,
sure to be a hot commodity by Christmas 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In a cryptic Internet posting Aug. 31, Beanie boss H. Ty Warner
announced that production would cease at the end The news was met
with disbelief and raging rumors among fans, but it was confirmed
two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Ty Inc.'s official Web site (www.ty.com) carried this
note, signed by Warner: ``A VERY IMPORTANT GLOBAL NEWSFLASH WILL BE
MADE ON DE CEMBER 24, 1999. EXPECT THE UNEX PECTED!!!''
</P>
<P>
   A mysterious character even to toy-industry experts, Warner
birthed the Beanie Babies in 1993 and has masterfully manipulated
the little dolls into a huge industry. Though conceived as a soft
plaything for toddlers, they quickly became a hot commodity among
collectors and a business worth hundreds of millions, if not
billions, of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Based in suburban Chicago, Ty Inc. is a privately held company,
so precise sales figures aren't available. Multiple phone calls
from The Arizona Republic were unreturned.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no estimate, because he's been so guarded on
everything,'' said Mary Beth Sobo lewski, editor of Mary Beth's
Bean Bag World Monthly magazine, a favorite independent information
source among collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Outside observers can only guess at the Beanies' sales figures.
For example, Sobolewski assumes that a Princess Diana tribute doll
sold 21 million copies, because Ty Inc. donated that many dollars _
$1 per doll _ to a charity fund in Diana's name.
</P>
<P>
   Another popularity indicator: Ac cording to one published
source, a McDonald's co-promotion moved more than 240 million
miniature (or Teenie) Babies in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Each baby carries a heart-shaped name tag, complete with ``birth
date'' and poem. Hallmark and Nordstrom stores sell them, but Ty
has otherwise generally limited dis tribution to smaller toy shops
and specialty stores. Every Beanie re leased is eventually
``retired,'' cap ping supply and feeding demand.
</P>
<P>
   The Beanies phenomenon pre dated the dawn of e trade, but Web
sites such as eBay quickly arose to connect collectors in real
time. (Ty's Web site, font of all official Beanie news, claims more
than 3.4 billion hits, or viewer visits.) Rare retiree Beanies,
originally sold for $5, routinely trade at e-auction for four
figures.
</P>
<P>
   On the resale market, about 20 percent of the 264 character
dolls are worth $1,000 or more, Sobo lewski said, adding that
interest in Beanie Babies peaked in the sum mer of 1998 and had
been waning slightly before the retirement an nouncement.
</P>
<P>
   The impending production shut down has prompted many fans to
fill holes in their collections, Sobo lewski said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run, I think your older, more valuable Beanies
that weren't out very long will become more and more valuable,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Later issues ``will hover in the $10, $15, $20 range'' on the
resale market because they were manu factured in greater numbers.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent collectibles show at Chris-Town Mall in central
Phoenix, Leslie Billings, 36, bought a black Beanie Baby bear named
The End _ issued Aug. 31, to commemorate the production shutdown
announce ment.
</P>
<P>
   Billings, who estimated her Beanie Babies collection at 175,
said she's not a speculative collec tor, but she does track her
menag erie's market value.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we needed something, they'd get sold,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Billings purchased The End from dealer Mark Cunningham, who said
collectors ``are being more selec tive, weighing the long-term
value.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody thinks they're going to get rich, they're out of
their minds,'' Cunningham added.
</P>
<P>
   Most Beanies followers expect Friday's announcement to reveal
Ty's next set of critters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know what's rumors and what's not,'' said Linda
Burner, co-owner of Bears &AMP; More in Glendale, adding that the
Beanies' forced retirement hasn't had much impact on her business,
which remains strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still had 15 ladies waiting for me to open my store this
morning,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sobolewski speculated that Ty's next set of collectible dolls is
likely to be smaller in size than Beanies (to maximize shelf space)
but will be stitched from a Ty-patented material called Tylon.
</P>
<P>
   And ``it'll definitely be coun terfeit-proof,'' perhaps by way
of holographic label stamp, she said. Burner said Warner is ``going
to the top end of plush.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People want very limited things,'' she said. ``I have a
feeling he's going to come out with some thing limited.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, ``Nobody knows,'' Cun ningham said, adding that Warner
isn't likely to abandon one of the most lucrative marketing phenom
ena of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't walk away from a $1 billion-a-year business.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Your card is in the mail!
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ This year, I just didn't feel up to it.
</P>
<P>
   The stress. The expectation. The last-minute scrambling. The
nagging fear that you're forgetting someone.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the Christmas card list.
</P>
<P>
   No, it isn't shopping that stresses me out. I'm a reluctant _
and therefore efficient _ shopper.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Christmas cards have always been my big holiday
production. When I was single, the Christmas card factory cranked
up the day after Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   I devoted night after night to long, heartfelt letters to
faraway friends explaining how much I'd been thinking of them _
even if I had somehow forgotten to write or call them during the
entire preceding year.
</P>
<P>
   And the funny thing was . . . I meant it. Friends stay in your
heart, whether or not you're in constant communication. You may
think of someone once a week, yet manage to get in touch only once
or twice a year.
</P>
<P>
   The list doubled when I married Jim. Then we had the kids . . .
the long, heartfelt letters dwindled to a few heartfelt paragraphs,
or the scrawled _ and habitually broken _ promise: ``Will write
after the holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, we were lucky to get heartfelt stamped names in return.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow I couldn't resort to form letters, much as I enjoyed
reading them myself. There was this family we dubbed ``The Perfect
Family,'' you see, and the arrival of their annual Christmas
letter, with its enumeration of all their perfections, was much
anticipated. What could we boast of? Getting our daughter
potty-trained at 4?
</P>
<P>
   The Christmas card list became as ponderous as Jacob Marley's
chain, and still, the compulsion persisted. I never felt ready
until that last card had been mailed out, that last envelope
sealed.
</P>
<P>
   This year, I greeted the Christmas cards _ not with the usual
delight, but with a sense of dread: ``Oh, no! Another one I'll have
to answer.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked myself: ``Why not just let it go this year? Other people
do it all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   And, so, it came to pass that, Sunday night _ five days before
Christmas Eve _ not a single missive had been mailed.
</P>
<P>
   I looked forlorn at the overstuffed basket of Christmas cards,
the form letters I hadn't yet read. I noticed a real letter in the
basket _ 10 pages! _ from a friend of Jim's we hadn't heard from in
several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly apologize for being out of touch for so long,'' she
wrote. ``You know how it goes _ you don't write . . . so you feel
bad . . . so you don't write . . . and you feel WORSE . . . There
were some mitigating circumstances, but I can only say I do value
you and your friendship, and I hope you forgive me.''
</P>
<P>
   The mitigating circumstances turned out to be the deaths of her
parents, two years in a row, and she hadn't had the heart to send
out Christmas letters.
</P>
<P>
   No apologies were necessary, of course, but she felt they were.
That's the beauty of Christmas cards _ you can call, write, sneak
into town, re-enter your friends' lives without embarrassment. You
are officially ``in touch.''
</P>
<P>
   I rummaged through the neglected basket and kids' pictures fell
out like confetti. The short notes sparked with affection,
encircling me in their warmth like the lights stringing our
Christmas tree. They told of new babies, new jobs, new homes _
short notes linking friends from year to year, milestone to
milestone.
</P>
<P>
   I took out the boxes of cards and checked off the first name on
the official list: Eric Ash. ``Love you, cousin. Will write after
Christmas.'' Check.

<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ If retail is war, then the students of
Providence Place Academy are the first cadets in the country to
have their boot camp on the field of battle.
</P>
<P>
   The academy, a fledgling alternative public high school oriented
toward business training, may be the first vocational high school
in the nation to be based in a working mall. Classrooms have yet to
be moved to the gigantic new Providence Place mall in the heart of
this reviving city, but the academy's initial 14 students, as
afternoon interns, are seeing their first combat just as the
fighting is fiercest: Christmas shopping season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can handle this, they can handle anything,'' Jo-Ann
Ward, the school's curriculum-design specialist, said. ``The rest
will be a walk in the park.''
</P>
<P>
   The academy's administrators have been tested as well in the
debate that has arisen over the school's creation.
</P>
<P>
   With Nordstrom and more than 100 other stores and restaurants,
Providence Place, which opened in August, is a giant deal here,
tangible proof that the tired old industrial city has new life. A
highway traveler who suddenly sees the mall looming above an
overpass might think he had just entered the city of Filene's.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Vincent A. Cianci Jr. provided much of the motivational
force behind the mall and was instrumental in the conception of
Providence Place Academy as well in discussions with city, school
and chamber of commerce officials.
</P>
<P>
   But the school's link to the mall is so unusual it has met with
resistance, said Paul Gounaris, director of the ``school to
career'' programs in the Providence school system. There have been
complaints from school committee members that it will be too
expensive, and criticism from opponents that it will simply funnel
students into dead-end cashier jobs they could have had anyway.
</P>
<P>
   One letter to The Providence Journal argued that the students
would be better served by interning at high-tech companies. Another
said: ``This school is recruiting our most precious assets: our
children. They are training them to serve the `white elite' in
menial jobs such as sales clerks, maids, food servers, and
janitors. Is it just another coincidence that the majority of the
students are poor and minority kids?''
</P>
<P>
   The second letter-writer was partly right. Most of the 14
afternoon interns, all juniors, are black, Asian or Hispanic, and
the program, which began in November, does have them ringing up
sales, stocking shelves, greeting customers and busing tables. (An
hour and a half of their labor is considered their internship, and
if they work longer, which most do, they are paid.)
</P>
<P>
   But the whole thrust of the school, its founders say, is to help
the students parlay their work experiences into learning and into
aspirations that can make the difference between success and
failure in the real world. The idea, they say, is to use the mall
as a great textbook, per a City Council resolution saying that the
mall should function in part as an educational setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think many of them will end up working in retail for
most of their lives,'' said Bernard Lough, the school's principal.
``They're using the skills they learn to broaden their horizons.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, among a half dozen students interviewed, there seemed to
be no stampede toward careers at Sak's Fifth Avenue. Rather, they
were full of the revelations of that first venture into the serious
working world: how to tie a tie, how so many things must be done
just perfectly, even how personal tribulations must be kept at
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you have troubles in your house, you have to always
have a smile on your face,'' said Ana Hernandez, an intern at
Nordstrom.
</P>
<P>
   That is the less formal learning that goes on at the academy.
The juniors also take a full academic course load in the mornings
and, perhaps most important, will be linking their work experiences
to the traditional ``three R's'' with requirements like keeping a
workday log that must be grammatically correct.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer, Gounaris said, the students will practice
analytical, research and communications skills: figuring out what
their store's market is, for example, researching the potential of
that market and giving an oral presentation.
</P>
<P>
   The academy is to move into its mall classrooms by late spring
and is scheduled to expand to 100 students next fall.
Administrators say there were many more applicants for the program
than there were slots. Its focus on learning by experience fits
into a broader movement intended to shift schools in that
direction, Gounaris said, as well as fitting into a growing
tendency for businesses to enter partnerships with schools. The
academy was created in conjunction with the mall's developers,
Commonwealth Development Group, and with Johnson &AMP; Wales, a
Providence university that includes a well-known culinary college
among its divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Wales is providing classroom space and its students
are serving as mentors. The mall, aside from providing the venues
where the students try their working wings, is giving them a kiosk
at which they can sell their own wares. The students are planning
to publish a children's book called ``Hair-o'' about a little
Jamaican boy whose long dreadlocks have magical powers.
</P>
<P>
   The stores seem happy with their roles as educators, although
there has been little time to teach the finer points of Retail 101
during the Christmas rush, school officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Almeida, manager of the Godiva chocolate store, said that
her intern, Saveth Som, had learned what a Christmas crush was all
about. ``She's either going to love retail after this or hate it,''
Ms. Almeida said. ``There's no gray in retail.''
</P>
<P>
   It is love for Jairo Garcia, the intern in Restoration Hardware.
Still, Garcia said, ``I want to be a pilot and have my own
airlines.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether they love or hate their jobs, Providence Place interns
had better not act like those teen-agers who ``hang'' at the mall
merely to wile away their time. The difference between the interns
and their peers, Ms. Ward said, is, ``Ours don't hang.''

MIDSTREAM: BABY BOOMERS A BLIP, BUT WITH A LEGACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Dec. 26)  
 (bl)  
 By JAMES SCHEMBARI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In barely 50 years, we baby boomers have certainly made our mark
on the current millennium. We have risen to political power and
created a high-technology world that will shape the future. On the
calendar, we have been but a blip in this millennium, but one that
has made much noise. Who can dispute that boomers are on top now?
</P>
<P>
   But as we celebrate on Friday, we should be aware that what
dawns on Saturday will be the beginning of the end of baby-boomer
dominance. It won't be our millennium; it won't even be our
century. I suspect that when our great-grandchildren celebrate the
arrival of 2100, the phrase ``baby boomer'' will have long gone out
of the vocabulary. What exactly was a flapper, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   So what will happen to boomers in the next century? We will soon
know whether boomers were able to accomplish the basics, like
saving enough for retirement and enough to send the baby boomlet
through college, and some of us may learn whether it was wise to
spend $1 million in the New York suburbs for a five-bedroom home on
a quarter-acre lot. Will we really be retiring early, as many of us
dream, or will we be hanging on until someone puts us out to
pasture?
</P>
<P>
   To get an idea of what is in store for us, I asked two experts,
both of them baby boomers themselves: Edward N. Wolff, a professor
of economics at New York University, who has long studied wealth
and its effects, and Bambi Holzer, a senior vice president for
investments at PaineWebber, who wrote ``Retire Rich: The Baby
Boomer's Guide to a Secure Future'' (John Wiley &AMP; Sons, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   Optimistic about their generation, both said boomers were likely
to meet all their financial goals. Wolff said it would be a
remarkable achievement, considering that boomers entered the work
force when the economy was stagnant and that the sheer volume of
workers kept wages low. And the money they did have, he said, they
spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the spendthrift generation 20 years ago, the
generation that didn't save at all,'' he said. ``Now they've
accumulated a large amount of wealth. It will turn out that they
did better than their parents because their parents were more
conservative. Baby boomers have been much more adventurous.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolff said his research showed that in 1998, the average wealth
of baby boomers 44 to 49 years old was about $245,000, more than 60
percent more than what their parents had at the same age, adjusted
for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   He and Ms. Holzer said one reason was that with the decline of
traditional pensions, boomers had to take over saving for their
retirement. That taught them how to invest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baby boomer generation was the first do-it-yourself
generation in investing,'' she said. ``As a result of that
education, our generation is aware of the investment process. It
has been forecast that the 401(k) assets amassed by individuals
will be greater than the value of their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   If we're so smart, will we be smart enough to get out in time,
before a market crash?
</P>
<P>
   Wolff says yes, and he even thinks that we probably won't get
stuck with overpriced houses. But it may not have anything to do
with savvy. We will just become more conservative with money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's going to happen is those close to retirement
are going to buy retirement homes,'' he said. ``Boomers will also
begin to diversify more into bonds and liquid assets, such as CDs
and Treasury bills. And they will pay off outstanding mortgages.''
</P>
<P>
   On retirement, Wolff and Ms. Holzer both predicted that boomers
wouldn't keep it simple. ``Boomers won't want a rocking-chair
retirement,'' Ms. Holzer said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff said boomers did not identify with careers as their
parents did and would gladly let go of the reins. They would then
direct energies elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby boomers are more interested in personal fulfillment,'' he
said. ``They will be much more in tune with bettering themselves. I
think they will still be a force politically and culturally and
will contribute to the intellectual life of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   That's quite an assessment for a generation that had such a
countercultural start. Boomers, Wolff said, will accomplish their
goals ``despite their gloomy beginning and the initial perception
of the generation, much to our parents' surprise.''

   Tracking down embezzlers, computer hackers, money launderers,
shady stock promoters and other white-collar criminals may lack the
pizazz of James Bond outwitting Goldfinger or decapitating Oddjob.
</P>
<P>
   But in a post-Cold War global economy, don't be surprised if
some of the first movie heroes of the new millennium are
bespectacled, Palm VII-packing auditors from Big Five accounting
firms, Web browsers at the ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``The breadth of criminal activities facilitated by global
computer networksas lifting personal credit card
information, redirecting electronic funds and stealing proprietary
and other confidential information, continues to grow,'' said
Stephen O. Pierce, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers who heads
its investigations unit.
</P>
<P>
   And crimes could hit close to home. One of the firm's clients,
the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., a federal agency that sends
checks to some 500,000 retirees, recently found its computer
defenses penetrated by security experts who could have robbed it
blind. The reason they didn't was that the break-in was a test of
the agency's systems, determining that for all the electronic
safeguards, it was vulnerable to external and internal attack.
</P>
<P>
   With businesses rushing to go online, theft and fraud are not
far behind. E-commerce has spawned its own array of hard-to-detect
cybercrimes, like transaction fraud and Web site destruction. The
crimes are producing not only fear in corporations, but also many
new assignments for auditors and consultants, who are increasingly
being asked to trace e-mail and ferret out smoldering diskettes.
</P>
<P>
   But in trying to find gumshoes who can sniff out white-collar
crime from three cubicles away, Big Five recruiters obviously won't
find many candidates on the B-school campus. That is why, over the
last 18 months, almost all of the 25 new employees hired for the
Deloitte &AMP; Touche forensic and investigative services division came
with law-enforcement experience. And PricewaterhouseCoopers, in
addition to hiring former FBI and Interpol agents, has just
recruited Scott Charney, 43, formerly a top cybercop at the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   At Ernst &AMP; Young, the forensic investigations practice has more
than tripled in two years, said Cheryl Sparkes, a partner. ``We've
gone from 30 to 100 employees and we're aggressively seeking
more,'' she said, ``mostly with law enforcement and other
investigative backgrounds.''
</P>
<P>
   C &QL; 
onsider Don Svendson, 50, hired last year after a 26-year career
with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to run Deloitte &AMP; Touche's
investigative office in Chicago. ``There's no end in sight to the
rise in embezzlement, executive malfeasance and money laundering,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though a roaring economy and the dot-com invasion make pastures
greener for criminal activity, Svendson says there is more to it
than that. ``Corporations are leaner and meaner, the management
turnover is high and companies can't exercise all the controls they
really need,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Svendson may well be a typical recruit _ someone with
professional training in criminal justice and decades of hands-on
experience. While the job may not sound as adrenaline-pumping as
his previous work _ which included commanding a SWAT team in
Manitoba and breaking up riots _ he says he finds it thrilling.
</P>
<P>
   Having extracted confessions from rapists and hit men, Svendson
was recently asked to put his interrogation skills to work on
someone suspected of embezzlement at a company after irregularities
were found. Svendson said he got the employee to confess; the
employee was dismissed. ``You need to know what body language to
look for and how to ask the questions,'' Svendson said. Ed Rial,
40, recently made the leap from criminal justice to corporate fraud
investigation, and is now a Deloitte partner. Rial, who dreamed as
a boy of being a detective, graduated from the University of
Pennsylvania law school in 1984 and took a job at the Justice
Department in Manhattan. He spent almost a decade as a federal
prosecutor and four years in charge of a New York office of the
department's business and securities fraud unit, bringing to trial
cases involving drugs, murder and kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   With Deloitte since November, Rial specializes in hunting down
corporate fraud, kickback schemes and insurance fraud. These days,
he sees stock fraud as the fastest-growing white-collar crime. In
particular, he cites outfits that take shell companies public,
trade with cronies, then dump the shares into the public's lap
through cold calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these boiler-room brokers worked for years as
telemarketers,'' Rial said. ``They have phenomenal sales skills and
are completely unscrupulous. And it's incredible the amount of
participation they get from smart people _ doctors, lawyers and
educators.''
</P>
<P>
   The quick stock-market success of Internet companies, he added,
makes people more susceptible to high-technology pitches from
fraudulent promoters. And many people don't think of white-collar
crime as a big issue anyhow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's because the perpetrators are often the people you grew up
with, the best friend of your father,'' Rial said.``They're almost
always people in very senior positions. Believe me, no one ever
says, `I always suspected him.'''

RAIL STOCKS: WHAT'S BEYOND THE TUNNEL? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Dec. 26)  
 (bl)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A little more than a century ago, railroads were the equivalent
of today's Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the $40 billion North American railroad industry
remains a core component of the economic and transportation
infrastructure. But no one will confuse Burlington Northern Santa
Fe or Canadian National Railway _ which last week announced a $6
billion deal to form the biggest railroad on the continent _ with
Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   The merger is the latest of many over the last few years. But
consolidation and good economic times have yet to do much to raise
the bottom line. And investors are really turned off: for the last
three years, the group has badly underperformed the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Yablon, a managing director and transportation analyst at
Credit Suisse First Boston, took some time last week to talk about
the merger, the railroads and their competitors. Following are
excerpts from the conversation:
</P>
<P>
   Q. Wall Street was not immediately impressed with the
Burlington-Canadian deal. Do you think this is a good marriage?
</P>
<P>
   A. It makes sense longer term. Both companies will achieve more
together than they would separately.
</P>
<P>
   A big part of the reason it makes sense is that these two roads
are leveraging themselves to north-south trade, be it Canada-U.S.
trade or Mexico-U.S. trade. The volume of this NAFTA trade, if you
like, is growing two to three times faster than the volume of
domestic trade flowing from east to west, or vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   But when investors see the results they have seen over the last
couple of years, they tend to be skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   Q. There is also some doubt about whether it will be approved by
regulators. Will it?
</P>
<P>
   A. I suspect it will get approved. There is not much overlap
between the two roads. The things I understand the Surface
Transportation Board looks at are public harms and public benefits,
and how much one offsets the other. And I don't think the other
railroads feel this is such an intrusive merger that they will need
to fight it.
</P>
<P>
   Q. The strong economy and the cost-cutting that comes as an
industry consolidates are conditions that Wall Street usually
loves. But the railroads haven't yet seen much benefit. Why not?
</P>
<P>
   A. To begin with, we are in an economy that has been driven more
by service improvements than by rising production of things like
chemicals, coal, grain and lumber. And hauling those sorts of
things is what the railroads do.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the strong economy masks some things. Because the dollar
has been strong, coal traffic, which is a lucrative market for
railroads, has been declining due to more attractively priced coal
from other countries. Similarly, grain traffic bound for Asia has
been anemic because of the crisis in that region. That has hurt and
put a cloud over revenues.
</P>
<P>
   And there have been integration issues stemming from these
mergers, particularly in the East, where Norfolk Southern and CSX
split up Conrail. Whatever revenue stream you have seen from these
mergers has been masked by integration costs.
</P>
<P>
   Railroads realize they must get service up to satisfy their
shippers before they can turn to looking out for their
shareholders. That is one of the reasons the stocks have not done
so well.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can you make an investment case for owning railroads right
now?
</P>
<P>
   A. I am not making the investment case for railroads right now.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, we have been quite bullish on the group. But over
the last couple of years, that has not been the case. I think the
industry needs to improve service levels and show that
congestion-related issues are falling by the wayside. Improvement
in those areas will raise investor confidence and the valuation of
these stocks. Broadly speaking, that is not happening on a
steady-enough basis at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at the moment, we are recommending Union Pacific and
Burlington Northern.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Of the freight transportation groups you follow _ air
transport, railroads and trucks _ which one has the best investment
potential over the next year?
</P>
<P>
   A. Over the course of the next year, truckers have the best
potential, followed by rails and then air freight, with the
exception of United Parcel Service.
</P>
<P>
   Trucking share prices are trading at almost recession-like
levels and shippers are using fewer and fewer truckers.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the only stock that is working and has worked is
USFreightways.
</P>
<P>
   Two others are Swift Transportation and Covenant Transport. Both
companies are 20 percent growers whose stocks are trading at
historically low valuations. Both are non-union organizations with
enormous, enormous potential. They do have the risk of rising
gasoline prices, but they can pass that through to customers in the
form of higher prices.

 FIVE QUESTIONS FOR jIM STRUPP: THINKING SMALLER ABOUT BEER

<P>
   NEW YORK _ What does Platinum Holdings see in the also-rans of
the beer business?
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 16, Platinum, a little-known New York investment
company, announced a deal to acquire the brewing operations of the
Genessee Corp. of Rochester. Platinum will add Genessee to its City
Brewing unit, which last July acquired the former G. Heileman
brewery in La Crosse, Wis., which most recently was used to make
Stroh's beer. Terms of the Genessee deal were not disclosed; the
price tag on Heileman was $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   In a business ever more dominated by Anheuser-Busch, the Miller
Brewing unit of Phillip Morris and Adolph Coors, which together
have 80 percent of the market, Genessee was in fifth place, at
$103.3 million in sales. That put it far behind the No. 4, Pabst
Brewing, which has been buying up other second-tier brands.
Analysts saw little chance Genessee could stay independent.
</P>
<P>
   Other midsized breweries have been crushed between the vice jaws
of the mass market beers on one side and the more expensive imports
and microbrewery products on the other. But Jim Strupp, chairman of
both Platinum and City Brewing, sees an opportunity. After slashing
payrolls at the La Crosse plant, City Brewing introduced two beers
marketed for regional appeal last week, with others in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Strupp took time last week to discuss a strategy that holds
obvious risks. Here are excerpts from the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   _ By ELLEN ALMER
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why move into beer now, when the giants dominate the market
and many midsized breweries are foundering?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, number one, we don't want to take on the giants. We
think there's an opportunity for a small regional brewery to be
successful, if the costs are very competitive and if we focus on
niche marketing.
</P>
<P>
   We don't try to spread ourselves too thin. We're not going to
compete with Miller or Budweiser; we're not trying to be all things
to all people. Rolling Rock is a success, and a good example of
what we're doing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why would consumers choose your brew over a beer like
Budweiser that might be a bit cheaper or more heavily promoted? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. First of all, it's very good beer. We just introduced City
Lager and City Light to rave reviews here in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   We believe people will support a good local beer because it
comes from here. In La Crosse, we've kept the brewery open. These
are premium local beers, made by the people who live here. There's
a big demand.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What are the bottom-line advantages of limiting yourself to a
regional approach? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Obviously, your distribution costs are much less. Our costs
are one-eighth what Stroh's were.
</P>
<P>
   And your chances are greater for your brewery to be identified
with an area. People are familiar with it (the La Crosse plant)
because it's been here for 140 years, and it's got a long tradition
_ it's part of the heritage in Wisconsin. I'm from La Crosse, I
went to college in Milwaukee, and I'm familiar with the beer in the
area, and the work force _ they're very hard-working people.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe County (N.Y.) is the same. It's a good region, and
Genessee is a great name.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You have said you hope to pare down overhead at Genessee, and
step up production from 1.6 million barrels a year to 3 million.
How will you do both at the same time? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You cut out corporate staffs. And you work with the labor
unions in terms of simplifying labor contracts, which is what we
did in La Crosse.
</P>
<P>
   We went from 26 labor classifications to one, so now people can
do more than one job, they have multiple skills, and you have fewer
workers. The employees benefit on the other end: They get gain
sharing, stock appreciation rights, 401(k)'s.
</P>
<P>
   Plus the typical unions knew if we weren't successful, all the
jobs would go away.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Where will future growth come from _ acquisitions of more
regional breweries? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Possibly, depending on what's available. Plus we'll do a lot
of contract work for other (beer) companies.
</P>
<P>
   We're also in the water and fruit juice business. And in La
Crosse, we're putting in an ethanol plant _ it comes right out of
the brewery. You just run the corn through some similar processes
as the beer, then you add some distillation, blend it off and sell
it. Our investment costs are one-fifth of what they'd be if we
started from scratch.

   Crazy markets call for wacky stock valuation methods. Forget
price-to-sales ratios; why not rank stocks based on the gross
domestic products of the world's nations?
</P>
<P>
   GDP, to be sure, is the yearly output of goods and services of a
country, while market value, a company's total worth, changes
daily. Moreover, GDP cannot capture all that is generated in the
information age.
</P>
<P>
   But with stocks so high, it is a telling exercise. ``These
stocks have become like major land masses,'' Theodore Aronson,
principal of Aronson &AMP; Partners in Philadelphia. ``There's nothing
to compare them to anymore. It's price to fantasy.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Edward Hartman Reisner Jr., a cancer specialist known for
his work with vitamin B12, died Dec. 16 at Valley Hospital in
Ridgewood, N.J. A longtime resident of Tenafly, N.J., he was 84 and
lived in a retirement community in Allendale, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his research and a private practice, Reisner had
a 43-year affiliation with St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan, where
he kept his laboratory and where he was chairman of the department
of oncology. He retired in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   He published more than 85 papers relating to his research in
nutrition and cancer. In the 1950s, he and Dr. Randolf West
reported results of a study showing that B12 was the element
missing from the blood of patients with pernicious anemia, which is
often fatal. Their discovery led to a treatment.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Manhattan, Kan., Reisner was reared in New York City
and graduated from Columbia College in 1935 and from Columbia's
College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   He was a captain in the Army Medical Corps in World War II and
earned a Bronze Star for bravery in the Battle of the Bulge.

SHUTTLE ASTRONAUTS REPLACE HUBBLE COMPUTER 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Spacewalking astronauts from the shuttle Discovery
scaled the towering Hubble Space Telescope on Thursday for a second
time, replacing the observatory's sluggish main computer with a
faster model and finishing repairs to the recently disabled
pointing system.
</P>
<P>
   As the second spacewalk of Discovery's repair mission to the $4
billion observatory drew to a close, the seven astronauts had
accomplished the tasks NASA considered essential to qualify the
flight a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hubble Space Telescope is essentially back up to full
capability,'' said NASA spokesman Kyle Herring.
</P>
<P>
   The astronauts planned a final excursion Friday to make the near
10-year-old observatory even more robust.
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday, the six new gyroscopes installed during the
first spacewalk passed an exhaustive test, allowing NASA managers
to declare the repair with the highest priority a success. Crucial
to the precise pointing of the telescope, the new gyros will enable
astronomers to resume the celestial observations halted in
mid-November because of successive failures.
</P>
<P>
   Voltage regulators installed during the first spacewalk to
prolong the life of the telescope's six aging power storage
batteries passed a thorough checkout as well.
</P>
<P>
   Astronauts Mike Foale and Claude Nicollier teamed for Thursday's
eight-hour excursion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonderful. Beautiful,'' exclaimed Nicollier, as Discovery
sailed more than 360 miles above the Pacific Ocean. ``It's a great
privilege to work on Hubble for the astronomical community all over
the world.``
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Foale and Nicollier were perched on the tip of the
shuttle's 55-foot-long robot arm, rising to an equipment bay that
houses the Hubble's main computer at the midsection of the
42-foot-long space telescope.
</P>
<P>
   The observatory has towered from a berthing mechanism in the
shuttle's cargo bay since the Discovery astronauts rendezvoused
with the telescope Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Within two-and-a-half hours, Foale and Nicollier had removed the
telescope's original, late 1970s-era computer and replaced it with
a newer model.
</P>
<P>
   The new $7 million computer has 20 times the processing speed of
the older model and six times its memory.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Foale assisted Nicollier with another time consuming
repair task.
</P>
<P>
   Again riding the tip of the shuttle arm, the two spacewalkers
ascended midway up the side of the telescope to replace one of the
observatory's three fine guidance sensors. Like the gyros, the
sensors are crucial to aiming the telescope at celestial targets
and holding it steady.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing the large sensor proved difficult. A $13 million
replacement wedged out of position as the two spacewalkers tried to
slide it into place. Nicollier and Foale wiggled it free, removed
it and reinserted the sensor without difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, concerned ground controllers noted a high carbon
dioxide reading from medical sensors within Nicollier's space suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm working hard, but I feel fine,'' Nicollier assured mission
control, where experts determined the high readings were probably
coming from an errant sensor. ``I'm just thirsty, but I'm OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Thursday's successful spacewalk completed all of the
major Hubble repair tasks assigned to Discovery's crew, astronauts
Steve Smith and John Grunsfeld will return to the telescope again
Friday during a third and final excursion.
</P>
<P>
   As an encore to Wednesday's gyro repair, Smith and Grunsfeld
will install a faster data recorder and a new transmitter. Both are
used to store the celestial imagery gathered by the telescope and
relay it to ground-based astronomers.
</P>
<P>
   The space telescope was launched in 1990. Discovery's is the
third shuttle visit to the telescope, which was developed so that
it could be repaired and equipped with new instruments by
spacewalking astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly a decade in orbit, Hubble remains one of the
world's most powerful observatories.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers have used it to refine the age of the universe at
about 12 billion years and to bolster theories that it will expand
forever. Its images have helped to confirm the existence of black
holes and revealed disks of dust and gas around young stars that
seem to be planets in the making.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery's astronauts plan to re-deploy the 12.5-ton
observatory Christmas Day. The astronauts are scheduled to end
their eight-day mission at 5:24 p.m. EST Monday with a landing at
NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. &QL;

MARCEL LANDOWSKI, 84, A FORCE IN CLASSICAL MUSIC IN FRANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Marcel Landowski, a prominent French composer and
conductor who defended the virtues of classical music against what
he called avant-garde ``over-experimentation,'' died Wednesday in a
Paris hospital. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   Landowski was a prolific composer, with 150 works to his name
ranging from symphonies and operas to film soundtracks. But he was
just as well known in France as a promoter of music education in
schools and as the driving force behind the creation of several
regional orchestras and the Orchestre de Paris.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to other renowned postwar conductors, however, he
was never formally associated with a major orchestra. Rather, his
career was built around posts in education and government, most
important among them the job of first director of music, dance and
lyrical arts in the Culture Ministry in the early 1970s, under the
leadership of Andre Malraux.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Pont l'Abbe in Brittany on Feb. 18, 1915, Landowski was
raised in a family of artists. His great-grandfather, Henri
Vieuxtemps, was a famous violinist; his father, Paul, was a
prominent sculptor.
</P>
<P>
   As a young man, he studied at the National Conservatory of Music
and, while still in his early 20s, began composing.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he became director of the conservatory of music in
Boulogne-sur-Seine in 1960, he was well established as a composer
through a broad range of orchestral and instrumental works, ballets
and operas. In the decades that followed, his pace of composing
slowed as he dedicated more time to administrative posts, among
them director of music at the Comedie Francaise and later cultural
director for the Paris city government.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the late 1970s, Landowski was increasingly
overshadowed by the modernist composer and conductor Pierre Boulez,
who benefited from enormous government support for his Institute of
Research and Coordination of Acoustic Music. And it was apparently
Boulez whom Landowski had in mind when he lamented that
``experimentation has become, for some, the goal of art.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Culture, in a statement,
described Landowski as ``open to the language of the 20th century
and impervious to the avant-garde, which he challenged.''
</P>
<P>
   Landowski is survived by his wife, Jacqueline, a former pianist;
a son, Marc; and two daughters, Anne and Manon.

 By DAVID BARRON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
With two shopping days left before Christmas, the Astros on
Thursday executed one of the season's most surprising transactions
by trading their best pitcher, Mike Hampton, and one of their
highest-paid outfielders, Derek Bell, to the New York Mets.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In return, the Astros will receive center fielder Roger Cedeno
and righthanded pitcher Octavio Dotel _ who both did what Hampton
and Bell could not do last year, which was to play prominent roles
in a dramatic playoff-game win over the Atlanta Braves _ along with
minor-league lefthander Kyle Kessel.
</P>
<P>
   They also, in conjunction with the recent trade to the Boston
Red Sox of center fielder Carl Everett, will trim almost $16
million in payroll costs for the 2000 season _ which happens to be
roughly the amount of money the Astros say they lost during 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But there are drawbacks. The trade leaves the Astros without a
lefthanded starting pitcher. It also costs them one of their most
popular players at a time when they need every shred of popularity
to sell seats at Enron Field.
</P>
<P>
   But with Hampton eligible for free agency after next season and
unwilling to discuss a long-term contract extension, the Astros
felt they had to make a deal _ albeit with no hard feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have great respect for what Mike Hampton has done for this
organization, and it doesn't get us anywhere to quarrel about the
decision not to sit down and negotiate an extension,'' said Astros
president Tal Smith. ``That's his right, and it's incumbent on us
as an organization to react and do what is in the best interests of
the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton said he understood.
</P>
<P>
   ``My time in Houston was great,'' he said. ``The fans looked out
for me and backed me all the way. There are no hard feelings, and
there's not one bad thing I can say.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a guy wants to test the market or if a guy is not
comfortable with his situation, it's his right to test it, and in
turn it's the club's right to do what is best for them to ensure
they get something in return. That is the case with both teams'
situations today.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell, the veteran outfielder who last year suffered through his
least productive season with the Astros, was less charitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I had an off year in my career, everybody
turned their back on me.'' he said. ``I'm going to try to turn it
around on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton's departure marks the second straight year the team has
lost its most prominent pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, late-season acquisition Randy Johnson left to sign a
lucrative free-agent deal with the Arizona Diamondbacks. The
possibility of losing Hampton, 27, who was 22-4 in 1999, after the
2000 season spurred general manager Gerry Hunsicker to action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right after the season was over, I expressed an interest to
Mike through his agent that we were interested in sitting down and
exploring a contract extension, and they did not seem real
motivated at the time,'' Hunsicker said.
</P>
<P>
   The parties met about a month ago in Florida, and Hampton's
agent called Hunsicker a day later to say Hampton would play out
his contract and test the free-agent waters for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of hit us between the eyes,'' Hunsicker said. ``I
certainly didn't see it coming. I guess as much as anything, he
forced our hand in this particular situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker then began what he described as ``a number of serious
discussions with a number of clubs,'' culminating in the
announcement of Thursday's trade.
</P>
<P>
   In return for Hampton and Bell, the Astros receive two young
players who had high-profile roles in perhaps the best game of the
1999 season _ the Mets' 15-inning win over the Braves in Game 5 of
the National League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   Dotel was the winning pitcher in that game despite giving up a
run in the 15th, and Cedeno, who stole 66 bases last season, was
the pinch runner who scored from third on Robin Ventura's dramatic
game-winning hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of fit, this trade is almost perfect,'' said Astros
manager Larry Dierker. ``Dotel fits as a starter, based on what he
did last year and Cedeno is a real burner to cover more ground in
center field and is an ideal No. 2 hitter behind (Craig) Biggio.''
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno said, ``I liked the team in New York, but I think things
happen for a good reason. This is perfect for me. This is an
opportunity, and I'm ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Kessel, a former Texas A&AMP;M basketball player, suffered a
shoulder injury in 1998 and had arthroscopic surgery last January.
He is expected to pitch in the Astros' minor-league system.
</P>
<P>
   Shedding almost $16 million in salaries _ $5.75 million for
Hampton, $5 million for Bell and a projected $4.8 million for
Everett, who was eligible for arbitration _ also allows the Astros
some financial wiggle room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone from a position where we were pushing up against a
limit and, quite frankly, were over where we wanted to be, to a
position where we have flexibility to add somebody before the
season or pick somebody up at the trading deadline,'' Hunsicker
said.
</P>
<P>
   And in a game that is as much dollars and cents as hits and
runs, they also are in position to edge into the black next season,
said Astros executive vice president Bob McClaren.
</P>
<P>
   McClaren said the Astros lost $16.5 million in 1999 on revenues
of $89 million with a player payroll of $56 million. With the move
to Enron Field, McClaren said the Astros expect revenues to total
$120 million in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan is to make the Astros a stable, financially secure
organization,'' McClaren said. ``(Owner Drayton McLane Jr.) has
been subsidizing it for several years, and the plan is to get away
from subsidies and go forward. We think a little tweaking now can
save us from having to make bigger moves in years to come.''

KOBE SILENCES CRITICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
LOS ANGELES _ From the NBA's Department of Unassailable Hypotheses
(D.U.H.) comes this news flash: !ital!The Lakers are a better team
with Kobe Bryant!off!.
</P>
<P>
   Seems obvious enough. Hardly seems worth arguing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for much of the past two seasons, critics ranging from
Bryant's own teammates to barstool prophets have posited otherwise:
That Bryant is too undisciplined, too selfish, to make anyone
around him better. That for all his talents, he's more disruptive
to his own team than the opponent.
</P>
<P>
   There was even speculation that Bryant's return to the Lakers
lineup, after a seven-week layoff due to injury, would mess with
the team's chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   It all sounds rather ludicrous right now.
</P>
<P>
   Since Bryant's return from the injured list Dec. 1, the Lakers
have won 11 out of 12 games. Their scoring is up. Rebounding is up.
Blocked shots and steals, both up.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant is averaging 22.8 points, 4.9 rebounds and, yes, 4.2
assists. And as for the presumed delicate balance among the Lakers'
elite triad of Bryant, Shaquille O'Neal and Glen Rice, things are
OK there too. Twice on the Lakers' recent road trip, all three
players scored 20-plus points in the same game. The scoring
emphasis shifts nightly, but all three have been involved.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be the Lakers are finally a three-star show, not a
three-ring circus?
</P>
<P>
   ``I never was concerned about it,'' coach Phil Jackson said
flatly.
</P>
<P>
   In part, Jackson's egalitarian triangle offense has taken care
of some of the ball-distribution issues. But the maturation of the
21-year-old Bryant might be the biggest factor in turning the
Lakers from the disjointed crew of last season into the juggernaut
of the last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's great,'' said Jackson, ``way more mature than I ever
could have imagined a 21-year-old kid to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Even on the Lakers' recent road trip, when Bryant's occasional
freelancing furrowed Jackson's professorial brow, he showed just
how much he's grown. Against the Minnesota Timberwolves, Bryant
dished out a career-high 12 assists to go with 28 points. He's more
than compensating for occasional fits of wildness.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times Kobe will take his own lead out there and I
understand that,'' Jackson said. ``I understand that he's got to be
able to read on his own, and that's very important. That's why
(Ron) Harper's out there with him, because (Harper)'s got a cool
hand, he knows what I want, and he knows how to organize the
offense in ways that are subtle and are purposeful.''
</P>
<P>
   And credit Bryant's seven-week study session for some of the
progress. While Bryant rehabbed a broken right hand, he observed
from the bench, learning the subtleties of the triangle offense,
consulting constantly with the assistant coaches and Jackson. When
he finally re-entered the lineup, the transition was nearly
seamless.
</P>
<P>
   ``My teammates, I feel pretty comfortable with them,'' Bryant
said. ``I know where they like things and what their timing is,
what their rhythm is. It's just a matter of becoming more of a
general of this offense and setting things up and when to set them
up, and kind of line the defense up and knock them down. That's
just going to come as we play more and more together.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that there weren't enough balls to go around
</P>
<P>
   a concern since Rice arrived via trade in March has subsided for
now. Bryant, O'Neal and Rice are one of the top scoring trios in
the NBA, averaging a combined 67 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``All three guys have found a way to be successful
offensively,'' guard Derek Fisher said. ``I think you have to give
credit to those three guys, as well as our offensive execution and
sharing the ball out there. We're trying not to dominate the
basketball to any one or two guys and give everybody a chance to
get some touches and some shots. We've been able to do that for the
most part.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been some bumps. A one-on-one duel with Toronto's
Vince Carter on Sunday showed Bryant is still prone to playing
showman at times. But Jackson has given Bryant enough freedom to
succeed or fail on his own, with only an occasional benching or
long chat to straighten him out.
</P>
<P>
   It's a style Bryant appreciates, and is benefiting from.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil is a different kind of coach, because in the past coaches
might have took me out of the game,'' Bryant said after the victory
at Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil said something to me at the airport, he said something to
me at halftime, and that's it. From then on out, if I mess up, I
know that I messed up right there. So I said, `OK, hold on, gotta
step back.' Some guys don't let you learn on your own.''
</P>
<P>
   The tough part for Bryant is those lessons are learned under the
glare of a national spotlight that has followed his every move
since he entered the league as a much-hyped 18-year-old. His
mistakes are often more exaggerated than his successes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think people are watching very, very closely. I think
they have been since I've been in the league,'' he said.
``Everybody's watching under a microscope, seeing what's going on
and trying to dissect things, pick things apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant is not entirely immune to the criticism, especially when
it comes within the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothers me at the moment, but then when we sit down and
watch film, it won't be as bad as portrayed. It might be one or two
times when (one-on-one play) will take place, but it wouldn't be as
bad as previously thought. So you just eliminate those couple
times, that's it. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not afraid to (tick) people off. I think y'all should know
that by now. I just go out there and do my job. Something goes
wrong, it goes wrong and I can live with that. But for the most
part I'm just out there playing, trying to put W's up in the
column.''
</P>
<P>
   The evidence, an NBA-best 22-5 record, more than suggests he's
succeeding. The Lakers better with Bryant? Duh.

JOHN LYDAY, 78, DIES; INSPIRED `TRAPPER JOHN' 
</HEADLINE>
   Eds.: In lede graf (STAR) should be replaced by symbol 
 (sw) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Elliott Lyday, the surgeon who inspired the character
Trapper John in ``M(STAR)A(STAR)S(STAR)H'' died of cancer Monday at
a hospital in Greensboro, N.C., where he lived. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   The 1968 novel led to Robert Altman's hit 1970 movie, which set
the standard for black comedies in its time. It also inspired both
the hit television series, which ran from 1972 to 1983, and a
sequel named ``Trapper John, M.D.,'' which ran from 1979 to 1986.
Trapper John was played by Elliott Gould in the movie, by Wayne
Rogers in the original television series and by Pernell Roberts in
the spinoff.
</P>
<P>
   The real Dr. Lyday was a highly decorated gunner and radioman on
a B-24 in World War II and served as a combat surgeon in the 8055th
Mobile Army Surgical Hospital in Korea. A fellow surgeon, H.
Richard Hornberger, writing under the pen name Richard Hooker, used
him as a model for Trapper John, one of the book's more colorful
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Lyday, by all accounts, was less flamboyant. But his daughter
Carolyn Lyday said her father had a dry sense of humor and often
used dark humor to describe the horrors of war, although she said
he never laughed about combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the prototype for Trapper John, the one who had the
baby back home,'' she said. ``I was that baby.'' Carolyn Lyday was
6 months old when her father went to Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The fictional Trapper John got his nickname before the war when
he ``trapped'' a beauty queen in the toilet of the Boston-Maine
Express. In one of the book's memorable scenes, he hangs from a
helicopter posing as Jesus, while his accomplices sell genuine
photos of the Savior to the boggle-eyed troops below.
</P>
<P>
   Hornberger, who died in 1997, always stressed that his book was
fiction intended to tell the larger truths of war. He once said
that those in his unit, like most soldiers, were simply too young
for their awful jobs. ``A few flipped their lids, but most just
raised hell in a variety of ways and degrees,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lyday's approach to life, at least after the war, was
exceptionally grounded and pragmatic. He returned to his native
North Carolina in 1958 to practice surgery at Moses Cone Hospital
in Greensboro, rejecting a teaching post at his alma mater, the
University of Pennsylvania Medical School. He was chief of surgery
at Cone from 1973 to 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was tough, loyal, honest as the day is long and
conservative,'' said Dr. Robert Phillips, his friend and
predecessor as head of general surgery at Cone.
</P>
<P>
   Lyday was the son of a mountain farmer in Pisgah Forest, N.C.
His grandfather and a brother were doctors. He graduated from the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he also attended
its two-year medical school. He earned his medical degree from the
University of Pennsylvania Medical School after World War II. After
Korea, he returned to Penn to serve his internship and residency.
</P>
<P>
   He enlisted during World War II and served in the Air Force in
England from 1942 to 1945. His rank was technical sergeant, and he
was in combat aboard B-24's as a gunner and radioman. He flew 32
missions over Europe and won numerous combat medals, including the
Distinguished Flying Cross. His daughter said tears would well up
when he recalled seeing comrades in planes next to him blasted out
of the sky.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his daughter Carolyn, of Newtown, Pa., he is
survived by his wife, Irma Friedrich Lyday; another daughter, Nancy
Lyday Jones of Wexford, Pa.; a brother, Robert, of Bryson City,
N.C.; and a granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter said he never traded on his celebrity status,
though he appeared on a local talk show once with Loretta Swit, who
played Maj. Margaret (Hot Lips) Hoolihan in the television series,
when she visited Greensboro years ago. He also attended reunions of
the 8055th MASH unit with Hornberger.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter said that Lyday felt like a very lucky man. ``He
wanted to make his life count,'' she said.

<P>
   CANON CITY, Colo. _ Excessive speed, the driver's health and the
design of the tour bus are being cited as possible critical
elements in the Tuesday crash that killed three Houstonians and
injured dozens.
</P>
<P>
   An official cause of the accident has not been determined, but
officials inspecting the scene and the bus said there were signs
the vehicle carrying 57 passengers from two youth church groups
back from a ski vacation was going too fast down the icy road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it was excessive speed, given the conditions,'' said
R.P. Quintana, an accident reconstruction investigator with the
Colorado State Patrol. Quintana added that extensive testing of the
brake and electronic systems shows ``the bus was mechanically
sound.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither state nor federal investigators would estimate the
vehicle's speed at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Medical officials said the 72-year-old bus driver, Robert Gene
Hawthorn, who died in the accident, had severe heart disease and
it's possible he had a heart attack during the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount of trauma to his body in the accident was not real
extensive,'' Deputy County Coroner Bill Holt said. ``We're still
weighing all of the possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado state troopers, however, say there is no evidence
Hawthorn's medical or physical condition had anything to do with
the accident, and that he died of massive head injuries.
</P>
<P>
   No alcohol or drugs were found in Hawthorn's system, Holt said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also noted that several of the injuries and at
least two of the deaths appear to have resulted from the victims
being thrown from the bus when its roof collapsed and split open
after rolling over.
</P>
<P>
   There are no federal standards on tour buses concerning safety
during rollovers, said Larry L. Yohe, an investigator with the
National Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 36 motorcoach accidents it investigated between 1968 and
1997, nearly two out of every three fatalities occurred during
rollovers, the government agency reported in a study released in
September. In those rollover accidents, 38 percent of those killed
were ejected from the bus.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB has been concerned about motorcoach window strength and
the ejection of passengers during rollovers for more than 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Larger windows, and therefore fewer vertical supports, have
become increasingly popular in the tourism industry. There is no
maximum window size in tour buses in the federal motor vehicle
safety standards.
</P>
<P>
   After the NTSB made recommendations to study the impact of
increasingly larger windows in tour buses on its overall structural
strength in 1973, the Federal Highwaistration said it found
merit in the request but lacked the funds to act on it.
</P>
<P>
   According to its recent report, the NTSB has since urged the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to study the effect
of larger windows on roof strength, and to design requirements that
newly manufactured buses would have to meet in two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have recommended to the Department of Transportation to
come up with standards and do a better job of keeping occupants in
their seats'' during tour bus rollover accidents, Yohe said.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB, however, still believes school buses and motorcoaches
are two of the safest ways to travel in the United States. On
average, nine school bus and four motorcoach passengers are killed
in crashes each year, according to the agency. In 1998, more than
41,000 people were killed in U.S. highway crashes in other
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators of Tuesday's accident said they will continue to
look into several factors, including Hawthorn's health.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorn and the two other fatalities, Christopher M. Scarberry,
17, and Kevin Matthew Donat, 16, both of Houston, were memorialized
Thursday night at Houston's Windwood Presbyterian Church, which the
teens attended and which co-sponsored the skiing trip.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight passengers remained hospitalized in three Colorado
hospitals Thursday, four in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred on ``Eight-Mile Hill,'' descending the
east side of the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it is a particularly dangerous stretch of
road,'' said Maj. Ron Adams of the Colorado State Patrol. ``It's
wide, and it has passing lanes built in.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the eastbound bus failed to make a curve to
the right, crossed two lanes of oncoming traffic and tumbled down
an embankment on the far side of the road.
</P>
<P>
   The distance the bus traveled across the highway is a major
reason investigators believe excessive speed was a factor, Quintana
said.
</P>
<P>
   Though no one knows the vehicle's speed, he said, passengers
have told investigators the driver was going so fast as to make
them uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Two federal and five state investigators Thursday tested the
brakes and other equipment on the bus.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone on the bus was thrown out as it tumbled and the
roof split open, Quintana said.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorn and one of the teens killed was ejected, he said, while
the other fatality was trapped inside the bus. The vehicle landed
on one of the teens, whom Quintana did not name.
</P>
<P>
   Yohe said he would not comment on the role the ejections might
have played in the deaths on the bus, which has been transported to
an airport hangar just east of Canon City for inspection.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look at it and judge for yourself,'' Yohe said, as
he sat in the driver's seat examining the control panel.
</P>
<P>
   The roof has collapsed and been peeled to the side, so half the
seats are exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Seat belts are also not required on tour buses, though some
members of Congress recently called for such legislation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Senators, including Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, recently
called for creation of a federal oversight agency to regulate buses
and trucks. The move followed a tour bus accident in Louisiana on
Mother's Day that killed 22 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   That accident was caused by a driver who, according to later
medical reports, was high on marijuana and dizzy from Benadryl. The
driver was also suffering from congestive heart failure and bad
kidneys. and had gotten out of the hospital less than eight hours
before reporting to work that morning.

AMERICAN FIGHTS FOR CONTROL OF PRAGUE TV STATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By LADKA BAUEROVA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ A vicious legal battle over Eastern
Europe's most successful television station has turned an important
American investor against the government of the Czech Republic and
now threatens to taint the country's reputation in the business
world.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Lauder, an heir to the Estee Lauder cosmetics giant, has
begun an arbitration case in which he contends that the Czech
authorities failed to protect his investment in the highly
profitable TV Nova, violating a 1991 treaty on mutual investment
protection. In full-page newspaper advertisements, Lauder has
warned investors against entering the Czech market.
</P>
<P>
   Lauder has requested compensation for lost profit and for the
calamitous devaluation of shares in his company, CME, whose stock
has fallen to less than $2 a share from $30 in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He says the loss is a result of unfair treatment by Czech
authorities. If the appointed arbitrators fail to negotiate a
settlement by mid-2000, the parties are expected to go to court.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has alarmed the Czech government, which wants to
join the European Union and has only recently become a full member
of NATO. With its economy stagnating, the Czech Republic depends
heavily on foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We invested $60 million to $80 million into this country
because we believed the contracts would be upheld. I was extremely
shocked when it didn't happen,'' Lauder said in a recent telephone
interview. ``Our station was hijacked.''
</P>
<P>
   The hijacker, Lauder says, is Vladimir Zelezny, the influential
general director of TV Nova. Zelezny maintains close relations with
Czech political circles. He has been seen associating with the
country's political leaders, including Prime Minister Milos Zeman
and the speaker of the house, Vaclav Klaus. With a 50 percent
market share, TV Nova is by far the most powerful opinion maker in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Zelezny, the majority shareholder of the license-holding
company, severed all ties with Lauder's service company after he
was fired for suspected fraud and mismanagement. Zelezny says he is
innocent of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The Czech authorities, Lauder says, have been either ignoring
his appeals or siding with Zelezny. So when the prime minister
visited the United States last month, he was welcomed by Lauder's
newspaper ads that were headlined ``Think Twice Before You Invest
in the Czech Republic.'' The text told readers that the Czech
Republic abused foreign investors and asserted that ``Czech
business, regulatory and legal practices fall woefully short of
international standards.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been trying for several months to talk to them about this
issue and they wouldn't speak to me,'' Lauder said in describing
his efforts to negotiate with the Czech officials. ``I had no other
way but to put an ad in the papers and warn other investors.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has become more serious than the government had
expected. Last month, the Czech minister of foreign affairs, Jan
Kavan, discussed the situation with the U.S. secretary of state,
Madeleine Albright, who warned against its possible negative effect
on American investor trust.
</P>
<P>
   Several influential members of Congress in Washington have
requested hearings into the TV Nova case and written to the Czech
prime minister, expressing their concern.
</P>
<P>
   The Czech government is trying to find a way to avert a court
battle with Lauder, who said he was willing to drop the case in
exchange for regaining TV Nova or another Czech television license.
</P>
<P>
   The finance minister has been mediating talks about the possible
sale of the other Czech commercial TV station, called TV Prima, to
Lauder. So far the negotiations have made little progress.
</P>
<P>
   Other foreign investors have expressed concern about the effect
of the case on the investment reputation of the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If CME wins the arbitration and continues to have difficulties
in the Czech court system, almost undoubtedly investors will
carefully consider that fact,'' said Michael Sonenshine, a senior
analyst at ING Barings in London.
</P>
<P>
   He said the dispute highlighted shortcomings in the Czech legal
and regulatory environment. ``There are gaping holes in the law,
the court process takes an incredibly long time, and laws are
vaguely worded, which makes their interpretation difficult,''
Sonenshine said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The trouble began last April when Lauder's company fired
Zelezny, then the general director of its Czech subsidiary, saying
he had defrauded and mismanaged the business. Zelezny fired right
back.
</P>
<P>
   As a majority shareholder of CET 21, the company that owns the
broadcasting license, he threatened to sever all cooperation with
Lauder's company and find another service provider. He fulfilled
that threat in August, defying Lauder's claim that the relationship
between CET 21 and Lauder's company was exclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Practically overnight, Zelezny cut off Lauder's company from
Czech advertising revenue, moved with his new business partners to
empty film studios on the outskirts of Prague, and began
broadcasting from there.
</P>
<P>
   None of the evidence Lauder's company has so far presented to
courts and police has stopped Zelezny from continuing to broadcast
and collect TV Nova's advertising revenue. He has refused to obey a
preliminary order issued on Nov. 10 by the International
Arbitration Tribunal in Stockholm, which instructed him to break
with all his current business partners and restore TV Nova's
previous relationship with Lauder's company until a final decision
is reached.
</P>
<P>
   For Lauder's company, the loss of TV Nova has come at the worst
possible time. Its other TV stations in Slovenia, Slovakia, Ukraine
and Romania are all losing money.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the company withdrew from Germany after failing to
capture any significant part of the market. The company also sold
its stake in the Polish station TVN after a dispute with the local
partner, and failed to win a TV license in Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his new office overlooking Prague's film studios,
Zelezny was unapologetic in a recent interview. He called Lauder an
arrogant figure who thought he could buy everything with his money.
``But not this time,'' he said, shaking his head vigorously.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is trying to cover up for his poor business skills by
blaming the Czech Republic,'' said Zelezny. ``It's a classic case
where an American businessman gets in trouble and then says, `You
know, it's the locals; it's a banana republic where law doesn't
mean anything.' But if you can't do business, don't blame others
for it.''

GENERAL MOTORS OFFICIAL GIVES UPBEAT REVIEW OF YEAR
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the hottest auto market on record winds to a close, a General
Motors executive gave an upbeat assessment of 1999 Thursday, a year
in which his company has earned record profits even as its market
share has declined. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   G. Richard Wagoner, president of GM, cited as successes the
company's strong profits, peaceful labor relations, new Internet
business initiatives, increased unit sales and revised models like
the Cadillac DeVille, Pontiac Bonneville, Chevrolet Impala and its
Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks. ``On balance, we feel
like 1999 was a pretty doggone good year here at General Motors,''
he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Wall Street analysts have had growing concerns about the GM
slide in market share. While the company's share has slowly
declined for decades it hit record lows for the last two months. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In October, the GM market share was 28 percent, a postwar low
for a nonstrike period. By November, its share sank to 27.1
percent. At its peak in 1962, GM sold 51 percent of the nation's
cars and trucks.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Wagoner said the November result was not part of the larger
trend. ``We had a lousy month,'' he said, adding that GM had failed
to quickly match competitors' rebates in certain segments. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The market share declines in the first 10 months of the year
came about for a different reason, he said: The company could not
build cars fast enough to meet the exceptionally high consumer
demand during this record sales year. Other large automakers,
including Ford, have also watched their market shares shrink. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wagoner said GM's November results were a temporary setback. ``I
don't think we had an 11-month problem,'' he said. ``We performed
poorly in November, and that caused appropriate reflection. Is it
appropriate to panic based on November? The answer is no.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But some Wall Street analysts disputed his interpretation. ``I'm
not sure that November was an aberration,'' David B. Healy, an auto
analyst at Burnham Securities, said. ``I don't really buy the idea
that there was a lack of availability all year long.'' Healy
attributed the GM market share declines to ``the boring product
line.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GM had set an internal goal early this year of selling 30 to 32
percent of the cars and trucks in the United States, based on an
expected total market of 15.5 million vehicles, said Steven J.
Harris, GM's vice president for communications. But this year,
automakers are expected to sell more than 17 million vehicles in
the United States. While GM has sold 750,000 more cars and trucks
this year than last year, its percentage of industry sales has only
matched last year's, when a strike shuttered the company for two
months. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wagoner seemed more willing than Harry J. Pearce, the GM
vice chairman, to excuse the company's market share declines. Both
men are contenders to replace John F. Smith Jr., the chairman and
chief executive, who is expected to retire soon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the November sales were reported, Pearce blamed senior
management for the results, saying, ``We have absolutely not
delivered on our commitment on market share, and that is simply
unacceptable.'' Pearce was unavailable for comment Thursday.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wagoner also said Thursday that GM was ``not crazy about'' a
decision by a South Korean government commission to hold an auction
for the auto assets of the Daewoo group. GM has spent nearly two
years negotiating to buy parts of the Korean company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the auction will lead us to pay more than it is
worth,'' Wagoner said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He also said GM was considering whether to exercise its option
to buy the portion of Saab that it did not already own. ``We have
the option until the end of January and I don't know if we'll get a
decision reached before then or not,'' he said. He said GM was not
in acquisition talks with any other European automakers.

EDITORIAL: IN SEARCH OF A NEW CHANCELLOR 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Dec. 24:
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Board of Education's decision not to extend
Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew's contract beyond its expiration next
June was almost inevitable, given the persistent friction between
Crew and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and the chancellor's failure to say
definitively whether he wished to serve an additional term. To
avoid a lame-duck period during which little would get done, the
board needs to buy out the remainder of Crew's contract and install
an able interim chancellor as swiftly as possible. Steady
leadership in the coming months will be crucial if the system is to
move forward with reforms that were begun on Crew's watch but have
yet to reach fruition.
</P>
<P>
   Crew leaves behind a commendable record after slightly more than
four years in office. First and foremost, he preached
accountability and championed the belief that all the system's
children can learn. His devotion to higher standards allowed the
system to boost reading scores slightly in each of the last three
years. He persuaded the State Legislature to rewrite the school
governance laws so that the system could hold principals and
superintendents accountable for how their schools and districts
perform. But the chancellor had yet to create the administrative
infrastructure to carry out his reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Crew initially enjoyed a close relationship with the mayor. But
his fortunes began to decline last spring when he and Giuliani
clashed over how the system should proceed on school construction.
The two came into conflict again when Giuliani endorsed a school
voucher experiment that the chancellor vehemently opposed. These
disputes eroded Crew's support in City Hall and among the mayor's
appointees on the board of education.
</P>
<P>
   But Crew's biggest mistake in the eyes of his supporters was
failing to make up his mind soon enough about whether he wished to
serve beyond the term of his current contract. His ambivalence
persisted from August _ when it became known that he was being
considered for another job _ right up to this week, when board
members got tired of the uncertainty and called a special meeting
to vote on his contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   Crew has been a stabilizing force both because of his leadership
abilities and the fact that he is the longest-serving chancellor in
nearly 20 years. This page has consistently urged him to stay on in
the interest of seeing his reforms through to the end. But now that
the board has voted to pursue a different course, it must move
swiftly to choose a new leader who can build on what this
chancellor has accomplished.

EDITORIAL: SEEKING JUSTICE IN PAKISTAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Dec. 24:
</P>
<P>
   Two and a half months after the military coup in Pakistan, the
ousted prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, is about to go on trial on
charges of conspiracy, kidnapping and waging war against the state.
If convicted, he could be hanged. But in a real sense, it is
Pakistan that is now on trial. Gen. Pervez Musharraf and the other
military rulers behind the coup have an obligation to ensure that
any former government officials charged with crimes have full
rights to defend themselves. So far the government's performance
has fallen short, particularly in the case of one important former
minister kidnapped by the army last week.
</P>
<P>
   The central case against Sharif and his close aides is that they
tried to dismiss Musharraf as army chief of staff, barring his
plane from landing in Karachi as it was returning from overseas.
The general says that only when he realized his life was in danger
did he carry out the coup. Sharif's lawyers contend that he
dismissed Musharraf to head off a coup.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Pakistan's lively press has been able to cover the
trial preliminaries, reporting on Sharif's arguments and his
complaints about being kept in solitary confinement. The latest
development is a charge that the flight recording system on the
plane supposedly rerouted on Sharif's orders has been erased,
raising suspicions that it was tampered with to destroy evidence
clearing the former prime minister of involvement. It is to the
coup leaders' credit that they have at least allowed these
disclosures to be aired. But nothing can justify the coup. However
unpopular he became, Sharif was Pakistan's duly elected leader. It
would be a grievous mistake to sentence him to death, no matter
what the charges.
</P>
<P>
   In one separate matter, the military rulers' performance has
been ominous. Last week soldiers picked up the former information
minister, Mushahid Hussain, who was under house arrest after the
coup. There is no word on where he is being kept, and the family
fears that he could be beaten or tortured to make him testify
against Sharif. According to some Pakistani press reports, Hussain
has been cleared of criminal activity by General Musharraf's
tribunals.
</P>
<P>
   Before Hussain joined the government, he was a prominent and
outspoken journalist. As a critic of the Taliban and other radicals
in Afghanistan he had many enemies, and his supporters say the
military leaders fear that he will mobilize the public against them
if he is released. Since no charge has been lodged against him, he
should be released immediately.

JOHN PATON DAVIES, 91, DIPLOMAT WHO RAN AFOUL OF MCCARTHY OVER
CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: A full-length version, OBIT-DAVIES, has also been filed)  
(lh) 
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Paton Davies, a leading diplomat who was among the ``old
China hands'' driven from the State Department after Sen. Joseph
McCarthy questioned their loyalty in the 1950s, died Thursday at
his home in Asheville, N.C. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Davies and about a dozen of the country's most eminent China
scholars and diplomats found themselves accused of having ``lost
China'' after Mao Tse-tung's Communist forces defeated Chiang
Kai-shek's Nationalists in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Among those accused of ``selling out'' Chiang were several
diplomats, including Oliver Edmund Clubb, John Carter Vincent and
John Stewart Service, and academics like Owen Lattimore and John
King Fairbank.
</P>
<P>
   But Davies may be one of the most poignant examples of those
whose careers were blighted in the hunt for scapegoats. He was a
decorated hero of World War II destined, according to his
superiors, for high rank in the State Department. He also was
regarded as a tough foe of Stalinism.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on Nov. 5, 1954, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles
dismissed him from the Foreign Service, maintaining that Davies had
``demonstrated a lack of judgment, discretion and reliability.''
</P>
<P>
   In hearings that had lasted for years, several of the China
hands, including Davies, Service and Vincent, were accused by Gen.
Patrick J. Hurley, Franklin D. Roosevelt's special envoy and then
ambassador to China (1944-45), of sabotaging his efforts to prevent
the collapse of the Nationalist government.
</P>
<P>
   One part of the case against Davies arose from his role in the
Tawny Pipit Affair. Tawny pipit was the code name for a covert
intelligence-gathering operation contemplated after the fall of the
Chinese Nationalist government in 1949. After the Communists took
over, Davies was delegated by George Kennan, director of policy
planning in the State Department, to attend a meeting on ways to
obtain intelligence from China. Davies suggested that approaches be
made to half a dozen Americans friendly with the Chinese Communist
leaders, with an eye toward enlisting them as double agents. The
idea was never pursued, but in 1952 Davies' critics contended that
he had been trying to infiltrate the U.S. intelligence network with
Communist sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning by a Senate subcommittee, Davies parried
questions while adhering to his understanding that anything
involving the CIA had to be kept secret. Later, subcommittee
members tried to charge Davies with perjury on the basis of his
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   John Paton Davies Jr. was born in China _ in Kiating, Sichuan
province, on April 6, 1908. His parents were Baptist missionaries.
</P>
<P>
   He spent two years at the University of Wisconsin, another at
Yenching University outside Beijing and a fourth at Columbia, from
which he graduated in 1931. He joined the Foreign Service and
returned to China the following year. He spent the next decade
observing the advance of the Japanese armies into China and
eventually evacuating U.S. civilians.
</P>
<P>
   When Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, Davies was in
Washington, on the State Department's China desk. He seized an
opportunity to join the staff of Gen. Joseph Stilwell, who had just
been named commander of the China-Burma-India theater. Stilwell's
forces suffered defeat in Burma; after leading a painful retreat,
Stilwell was given responsibility for organizing the defense of
India and China. Davies served as his chief diplomatic aide,
political adviser and interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 2, 1943, Davies was on a C-46 transport flying to China
from India when an engine failed and all aboard were ordered to
jump. Eric Sevareid, who was aboard as a radio correspondent,
recounted that none of the 17 passengers had ever used a parachute.
Davies, as the senior official, jumped first. It took a month for
the group to walk out of the jungle, and according to Sevareid it
was Davies who rallied them when it seemed impossible to go on.
Davies received the Medal of Freedom.
</P>
<P>
   In summer 1944, an observation group was sent to the Communist
headquarters at Yenan after prodding by Davies and the U.S. Army.
The mission confirmed reports of Communist strength in the north.
Hurley now began to denounce Davies and his colleagues, saying
their criticism of the Nationalists was meant to undermine his
attempt to unify the various Chinese military forces against the
Japanese. Davies was relieved to obtain a transfer to the U.S.
Embassy in Moscow in January 1945.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1945 the Japanese surrendered, and the opposing
Chinese armies raced to take over their sectors in a civil war.
Hurley resigned as ambassador in November 1945, blaming the China
hands, including Davies, for the failure of his mission.
</P>
<P>
   From 1947 to 1951, Davies served on the State Department's
policy planning staff, under Kennan.
</P>
<P>
   Assigned to Germany in 1951, Davies was called home in the next
year to testify about the Tawny Pipit Affair. He was cleared of a
Senate subcommittee's perjury charge but was transferred to Lima,
Peru, where he served as charge d'affaires.
</P>
<P>
   Still McCarthy hammered away at him, and in late 1954, a special
security board ruled that while Davies' loyalty could not be
questioned, his employment was ``not clearly consistent with the
interests of the national security.''
</P>
<P>
   He returned to his family in Lima.
</P>
<P>
   In India in 1942, he had married Patricia Grady, a correspondent
for The Washington Post. She survives, as do their seven children:
Sasha, of White Plains, N.Y.; Tiki, of Washington; John G., of
Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Susan, of Chatham, N.Y.; Jennifer, of
Seattle; Deborah, of London, and Megan, of New Orleans. Also
surviving are a brother, Donald, of State College, Pa., and 11
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Davies set up a shop in Lima to design and make furniture. He
also wrote a weekly column for a local newspaper, and worked his
writings into a book published in 1964, ``Foreign and Other
Affairs.'' In it he took a tough view of American policy in Latin
America, suggesting that Washington show more willingness to
support strong governments.
</P>
<P>
   About this time Davies returned to Washington. Friends began a
quiet effort to obtain his official rehabilitation, but it was not
until 1969 that he was granted a government security clearance to
work on a research project on Latin America at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Davies and his family then lived for several years in Malaga,
Spain. He and his wife settled in Asheville, N.C., when their
children began attending college. His second book, ``Dragon by the
Tail'' (1972), was both a memoir and a history of Chinese-American
relations from 1931 to 1945.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971 Davies, along with Fairbank and Service, was invited to
testify before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Its
chairman, William Fulbright, welcomed them by saying: ``It is a
very strange turn of fate that you gentlemen, who reported honestly
about conditions, were so persecuted because you were honest about
it.''

COUPLE THINK THEY'RE ON TRACK OF ANSWER TO ASTHMA 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; THE ARIZONA REPUBLIC
</P>
<P>
   Walk into James and Nancy Lee's research lab at the Mayo Clinic
in Scottsdale and you'll see mice, lots of mice.
</P>
<P>
   What you won't see is what makes these mice special: they lack a
gene that's believed to trigger asthma.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're wild-type mice,'' James said, ``except for the gene we
believe is important to asthma has been deleted.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one gene of the 20 to 50 suspected to play a role in
asthma.
</P>
<P>
   But if the one gene knocked out in the tan, red-eyed mice is the
key to asthma, the Lees' work could lead to relief for the nation's
17 million asthma sufferers, includ ing the 316,00 who live in
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Nancy Lee chants with her fists in the air, ``Asthma
vaccine, asthma vaccine!''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband is less optimistic about a vaccine, although he main
tains that all the genetic research going on will lead to
treatments tailored to each patient within the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest changes in the next five years will be in
diagnosis,'' he said. ``We'll be able to do genetic testing in the
future when people come into the emergency room with an asthma
attack so they get targeted treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many things in medicine, asthma is an extremely complex
condition. And not all asthma is created equal. Various forms
affect infants, children and adults, and those patients all respond
differently to treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Attacking the one gene that's common to all sufferers may be the
key to treatment. The debate is over which gene that is.
</P>
<P>
   The Lees believe the answer is the gene that controls immunoglob
ulin E, or IgE, the antibody that stimulates allergic responses
that lead to chronic airway inflamma tion. It's that inflammation
that constricts the lungs and makes it hard to breathe.
</P>
<P>
   Although other researchers are focusing on other genes, the
Lees' work has fans at the University of Arizona College of
Medicine, the Arizona Asthma and Allergy Insti tute and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate answer is in the airway inflammation,'' said the
insti tute's Dr. William Morgan, who also is an associate professor
for the University of Arizona Health Sci ences Center in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once that IgE process gets going, there's a whole lot of media
tors and chemical processes that get going. Ultimately, it's this
IgE response that's the root of all evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Using their backgrounds in mo lecular biology and genetics, the
Lees succeeded in genetically engi neering what they call IgE mice.
They also are able to clone the mice in their lab, which has
received funding from the Arizona Lung Association, the National
Institutes of Health, private foundations and pharmaceutical
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have long known that there's a genetic aspect to
asthma. That's magnified by asthma suffer ers ``self-selecting''
for the ailment by moving to places such as Arizona, for example,
to improve their condition. Asthma sufferers often meet other
asthmatics and end up having children.
</P>
<P>
   The Lees both have asthma, but they married 12 years ago back
East and moved in 1994 to Arizona, where they set up a result lab
at the Mayo Clinic to study asthma.
</P>
<P>
   Almost two years ago, the Lees had twins. Their daughter shows
no signs of the ailment, but their son already has a asthmalike
condition in infants known as ``bronchiolitis.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lees say males are more susceptible than females to asthma
and that women with asthma tend to pass it on to their sons more
often.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers are saddened that their son shares their
ailment, but it gives added urgency to their work and that of their
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid growing up, they didn't do much for you,''
Nancy said. ``No child should have to suffer from asthma in the
same way today.''

FOR NUMBER 19, THE PARTY IS OVER
 BY MARK JONATHAN DAVIS

 THE ARIZONA REPUBLIC 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am the number 19, and my days are numbered.
</P>
<P>
   You've heard the news, you've seen the future, you've checked
your calendar. The countdown is on, and yours truly, Nineteen, is
being eighty-sixed.
</P>
<P>
   You probably know me best for my recent work in the upper right
hand corner of your checks. It was back in the aughts when that
deal was first inked, thanks to some lazy banker who figured my
full-time position would be a colossal time saver. That move proved
to be the job of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the days. I was a prime number in my prime, the most
popular teen in town. 1941, 1963, 1984 . . . the suffix may have
changed each year, but the prefix was set in stone. You could find
me everywhere, on newspapers, year books, tax forms and driver's li
censes. Decade after decade, I was the duke of double digits.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the times they are a-changin', and me a-with 'em. As
the year 2000 approaches, it's dawned upon me that time is no
longer on my side.
</P>
<P>
   I guess all good things must come to an end. Sure, I had a
pretty good run, from 1900 to 1999. With each decade, the 10s would
climb, the ones with them. Some of those years I shared with
perfect strang ers: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and that do-nothing 0.
Other years _ well, they were special.
</P>
<P>
   1919 was my favorite, a once-in-a-lifetime tribute that let me
be me. But the 12-month celebration ended with a huge irony when
1920 ar rived; talk about foreshadowing. It wasn't until 1991, when
I had a chance to reflect, that I realized my time was almost up.
</P>
<P>
   And so, as my century of service comes to a close, I bid a fond
fare well to my starring role on the ep ochal scroll. I'd like to
take a second to thank 1 and 9 for their tireless teamwork, for
standing to gether and making me what I am (or, as of 1/1/2000,
was) today.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, the single digits are the lucky ones. Most of the
memorable things in life come in smaller quan tities: nine planets,
seven seas, five golden rings. Three guys go into a bar, not 19.
Or, just add a few zeroes, and you're a star with 200 Motels,
10,000 Maniacs and 500,000 Elvis Presley Fans Can't Be Wrong. But
nothing comes in 19,000.
</P>
<P>
   No, I never got picked to be in any cool numerical catch
phrases, like 23-skidoo or Catch-22. I would have liked to have
been remembered as the Magnificent 19, or the Fab Nineteen, or even
the Dirty Nine teen. I never had the cachet of 16 candles, 45 rpm
or Heinz 57. And no one got their kicks on Route 19.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, I wasn't un lucky enough to be unlucky 13,
or Area 51 or Turk 182. I'm proud that Johnny Unitas and Greg ``The
Bull'' Luzinski wore me on their uniforms. And I'm eternally
grateful to Paul Hardcastle's n-n-n-n-nice musical tribute in '85
(or 1985 as I should say).
</P>
<P>
   But as time goes by, I'll be counted out. No one will write me;
no more hot dates. So long, teenage.
</P>
<P>
   What will happen to me? Oh, I'll be around. Maybe we'll bump
into each other now and again . . . on a box of Product Me cereal
or, hey, in the echoes of a Steely Dan song. You might take Flight
19, rent Apartment 19, or perhaps pick me on a lottery ticket (go
for it, I'm feelin' lucky!). Most cities have a 19th Street, some
cities have a 19th Arrondissement. And there's always A.D. 19000 _
but don't hold your breath.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I'll make my regular monthly visits, plus I'll be
back for a yearlong stay in less than a score. Until then . . . try
to miss me, will ya?
</P>
<P>
   Before I turn over the 1900s, I have a few words for my replace
ment, numero 20:
</P>
<P>
   I've seen you looming for the last 100 years, crowding your way
into my spotlight all century long . . . all 20th century long,
that is! (Why is it that MY 100 years are known as YOUR century?)
</P>
<P>
   Twenty Flight Rock, 20 Ques tions, 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea,
20 this, 20th that _ nag, nag, nag. The sight of Hugh Downs will
forever make me cringe.
</P>
<P>
   Why, just in the past few years, the ATM has single-handedly
made you the dominating denomination! And I don't even want to talk
about this whole ``Y2K'' thing; I mean, you must be paying your
publicist a fortune!
</P>
<P>
   And now, the brand new millen nium is here, rubbing you in my
face. They're already printing you on the checks. But don't get too
comfy, 20. The clock never stops ticking, and before you know it,
you'll be dealt 21.
</P>
<P>
   So have fun leading the Napo leonic calendar into the future,
but don't make the same mistake I did. One-hundred years become
history quicker than you think, so live it up while you can.
Cherish the time you're here, and treasure those date books,
postmarks and wonderful, wonderful checks. Time will march on, but
even if you're having a good time, don't let it fly.
</P>
<P>
   I, 19, look back sadly, and regret that I may have taken this
fleeting life for granted. I should have sa vored every moment. But
now that I think of it, I guess hindsight is 20 _ aw, forget it.
</P>
<P>
   (Nineteen is a first-time writer. His new book, Why 2K?, won't
be in stores until next year, much to his chagrin.)
Raised in Phoenix, essayist Mark Jonathan Davis is the founder
ofideatownusa.com, a Los Angeles-based creative content con sulting

   And now, the brand new millen nium is here, rubbing you in my
face. They're already printing you on the checks. But don't get too
comfy, 20. The clock never stops ticking, and before you know it,
you'll be dealt 21.
</P>
<P>
   So have fun leading the Napo leonic calendar into the future,
but don't make the same mistake I did. One-hundred years become
history quicker than you think, so live it up while you can.
Cherish the time you're here, and treasure those date books,
postmarks and wonderful, wonderful checks. Time will march on, but
even if you're having a good time, don't let it fly.
</P>
<P>
   I, 19, look back sadly, and regret that I may have taken this
fleeting life for granted. I should have sa vored every moment. But
now that I think of it, I guess hindsight is 20 _ aw, forget it.

COUPLE THINK THEY'RE ON TRACK OF ANSWER TO ASTHMA 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; THE ARIZONA REPUBLIC (Scottsdale, AZ) - Walk into James and
Nancy Lee's research lab at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale and
you'll see mice, lots of mice.
</P>
<P>
   What you won't see is what makes these mice special: they lack a
gene that's believed to trigger asthma.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're wild-type mice,'' James said, ``except for the gene we
believe is important to asthma has been deleted.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one gene of the 20 to 50 suspected to play a role in
asthma.
</P>
<P>
   But if the one gene knocked out in the tan, red-eyed mice is the
key to asthma, the Lees' work could lead to relief for the nation's
17 million asthma sufferers, includ ing the 316,00 who live in
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Nancy Lee chants with her fists in the air, ``Asthma
vaccine, asthma vaccine!''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband is less optimistic about a vaccine, although he main
tains that all the genetic research going on will lead to
treatments tailored to each patient within the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest changes in the next five years will be in
diagnosis,'' he said. ``We'll be able to do genetic testing in the
future when people come into the emergency room with an asthma
attack so they get targeted treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many things in medicine, asthma is an extremely complex
condition. And not all asthma is created equal. Various forms
affect infants, children and adults, and those patients all respond
differently to treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Attacking the one gene that's common to all sufferers may be the
key to treatment. The debate is over which gene that is.
</P>
<P>
   The Lees believe the answer is the gene that controls immunoglob
ulin E, or IgE, the antibody that stimulates allergic responses
that lead to chronic airway inflamma tion. It's that inflammation
that constricts the lungs and makes it hard to breathe.
</P>
<P>
   Although other researchers are focusing on other genes, the
Lees' work has fans at the University of Arizona College of
Medicine, the Arizona Asthma and Allergy Insti tute and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate answer is in the airway inflammation,'' said the
insti tute's Dr. William Morgan, who also is an associate professor
for the University of Arizona Health Sci ences Center in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once that IgE process gets going, there's a whole lot of media
tors and chemical processes that get going. Ultimately, it's this
IgE response that's the root of all evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Using their backgrounds in mo lecular biology and genetics, the
Lees succeeded in genetically engi neering what they call IgE mice.
They also are able to clone the mice in their lab, which has
received funding from the Arizona Lung Association, the National
Institutes of Health, private foundations and pharmaceutical
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have long known that there's a genetic aspect to
asthma. That's magnified by asthma suffer ers ``self-selecting''
for the ailment by moving to places such as Arizona, for example,
to improve their condition. Asthma sufferers often meet other
asthmatics and end up having children.
</P>
<P>
   The Lees both have asthma, but they married 12 years ago back
East and moved in 1994 to Arizona, where they set up a result lab
at the Mayo Clinic to study asthma.
</P>
<P>
   Almost two years ago, the Lees had twins. Their daughter shows
no signs of the ailment, but their son already has a asthmalike
condition in infants known as ``bronchiolitis.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lees say males are more susceptible than females to asthma
and that women with asthma tend to pass it on to their sons more
often.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers are saddened that their son shares their
ailment, but it gives added urgency to their work and that of their
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid growing up, they didn't do much for you,''
Nancy said. ``No child should have to suffer from asthma in the
same way today.''

HOLIDAY BRINGS NICE THOUGHTS ABOUT BAD TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ The spirit of the season moves me toward
benevolence, or maybe I've just been weakened by the odor from
Bourbon Street on Christmas Eve.
</P>
<P>
   There's something rotten in the Big Easy, and the smell goes
beyond both football teams playing here Friday.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, no peace on North Texas earth, not with the
Dallas Cowboys being so weak and wobbly. Goodwill toward mankind
does not currently apply to the Chan Gaileys or the Troy Aikmans.
</P>
<P>
   O' come all ye faithful _ except when the Cowboys are 7-7 there
can be no heaven. Or faithful followers either.
</P>
<P>
   But with the mood so ugly back home, why allow football to
totally tarnish such a joyous time of year? Since it's Christmas
Eve, isn't there something good to be said about the Cowboys, at
least temporarily?
</P>
<P>
   Now that you mentioned it, yes, there is. In fact, I just
happened to have made a list, checked it twice, and what follows is
an attempt to be nice.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a Cowboys fan, climb down from your machine-gun nest
long enough to be thankful for these gifts:
</P>
<P>
   _ No unlawful flight to avoid prosecution for murder conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   _ No breaking-and-entering arrest for lusting after thy
neighbor. The emphasis here is on no arrests.
</P>
<P>
   _ No failed drug tests, no drug busts, no topless lizards
telling the cops wild stories, no fur coats in the court house, no
90 mph Mercedes wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   _ No amount of expense spared for the guidance and counseling
services of Calvin Hill in the locker room. Hill has raised the
do-right awareness level on what formerly was America's Most Wanted
Team.
</P>
<P>
   _ No Daniel Snyder. Finally, there's an NFL owner who makes us
appreciate Jerry.
</P>
<P>
   _ No problems with Alonzo Spellman, despite rip-jobs from here
when the Cowboys signed him. There was a very sordid past in
Chicago, but since his arrival at Valley Ranch, Spellman has been a
good citizen and good player.
</P>
<P>
   _ No on-the-field attacks on a referee, although Kevin Smith had
a case for one after the bogus pass interference in Sunday's game
against the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   _ No more Gunsmoke. Go ahead, barbecue Gailey. Even fire him.
But Chan is a football professional who replaced a national joke.
</P>
<P>
   _ No Randy Moss, but Greg Ellis instead. Moss is a player, and a
touchdown maker. Just the kind of receiver the Cowboys need. But
he's still got punk written all over him. Ellis, as it turned out,
is also a player. And nothing but class.
</P>
<P>
   _ No embarrassing draft busts in two years. Take a bow, Larry
Lacewell. More than any other factor, the Cowboys' current problems
can be directly traced to five previous years of draft disasters.
</P>
<P>
   _ No good news in the NFL on national TV ratings. The league
crowed back in October when ratings surprisingly soared. But since
then, all networks have experienced dramatic plunges. This proves
two things. (1) The fans know bad football when they see it, so
they don't see it as often. (2) The NFL needs the Cowboys to be
good, because after all these years they remain the king of
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   _ No negative goodbyes for Michael Irvin. If his career is
finished, Michael goes out a hero instead of just another name on
the police blotter. Everybody will remember this as a season when
the Cowboys missed him dearly.
</P>
<P>
   No valid excuse from Gailey or anyone else at Valley Ranch,
about the absence of Michael. Last summer in Wichita Falls, Irvin
wasn't even being considered a major contributor to the offense.
</P>
<P>
   _ Probably no more Indy Colts on future schedules for at least
three years. This is the team everyone will be wanting to dodge,
but particularly the Cowboys. The Colts, with their young Triplets,
provide a constant reminder of faded glory days at Valley Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   OK, I've become exhausted with being nice. It was a hard job,
but on Christmas Eve it seemed so appropriate. And truthfully, it
may have been the last chance.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys play the 2-12 Saints here Friday. They close the
regular season with the 7-7 Giants at Texas Stadium next week. A
loss in one of these games _ and after what was on display against
the Jets, it's certainly possible _ will cause a Rambo version of
the Grinch to descend upon Valley Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   It could become real ugly back home. So just in case this is the
final opportunity, I will say it now. Merry Christmas/Happy
Holidays. nn

ASTROS' HAND IS FORCED, SO METS DEALT AN ACE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At the winter meetings in Anaheim, Calif., less than
two weeks ago, the Houston Astros' general manager said his team
was not one of the clubs the New York Mets were badgering in their
efforts to find a front-line starting pitcher or a good-hitting
outfielder. ``They're not going this way,'' Gerry Hunsicker said.
``There's no match.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, the Mets and the Astros made it a match. The Mets
traded Roger Cedeno, the base-stealing outfielder who blossomed
last season, and Octavio Dotel, the young pitcher loaded with
promise, and a minor league pitcher, Kyle Kessel, for Mike Hampton,
who with 22 victories was the National League's No. 1 winner last
season, and Derek Bell, a run-producing outfielder, who suffered
through the least productive season of his career in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, who has not been
outworked by any of his peers the past two off-seasons, pulled off
the deal as neatly as his two middle infielders execute a double
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel this transaction certainly catapults us beyond the
team that won 97 games last year,'' Phillips said, his enthusiasm
for the deal and the team's prospects clearly showing through the
telephone on a conference call.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not often that you get the opportunity to acquire a No.
1-type starting pitcher,'' he added. ``When you get that
opportunity you have to be aggressive and try to bring him in. We
worked hard the last few days to get him. We've waited for this
opportunity for a long time to acquire a starting pitcher of
Hampton's ilk.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were able to acquire Hampton because he had recently
told the Astros that he planned to be a free agent after next
season. That status, of course, is what creates the risk for the
Mets in giving up two good young players to acquire him.
</P>
<P>
   The trade also answered one question. No, the Mets will not
renew their pursuit of Ken Griffey Jr. Cedeno and Dotel were two of
the ingredients the Mariners were considering for Griffey until he
said he would not approve a trade to the Mets. Cedeno and Dotel
were two players everyone sought from the Mets, and now the Astros
have them.
</P>
<P>
   ``One absolute in the deal,'' Hunsicker said, ``was I get a
young starting pitcher back who could go into our starting
rotation. Then it was who had the best overall value for us. I
wasn't focused on the outfield, but Cedeno offered a rather
hard-to-find package.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, 27, only three years older than Dotel, had a 22-4
record last year with a 2.90 earned run average, the third best in
the National League. He reeled off 11 consecutive victories leading
to No. 20, and he suffered only one loss after June 24, compiling a
13-1 record in his last 18 starts. He finished second to Randy
Johnson in the voting for the Cy Young Award.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one competitive nasty pitcher,'' Bobby Valentine, the
Mets' manager, said on the conference call.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, who has a $5.75 million salary next season, said it was
premature for him to think about a contract extension with the
Mets. But he said he was excited about the idea of playing for them
next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is a very exciting city,'' said Hampton, who was born
in Brooksville, Fla. ``I'm from a very small town, a country town,
but I've been able to get out and explore and do some things
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton said he was not scared by the thought of playing at Shea
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an exciting place to play,'' he said. ``The fans are
really into the game and it gets you pumped up. I go out with an
intensity and New York will probably bring it out in me more.''

4 FIRST-TIME DRUG OFFENDERS GRANTED CLEMENCY BY NEW YORK GOVERNOR
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki granted clemency Thursday to
four state prison inmates, and, following his pattern of years
past, he chose first-time offenders who were serving long sentences
under New York's harsh drug laws.
</P>
<P>
   The action brings to 17 the number of people the governor has
given clemency to in his five years in office. Fifteen of these
were convicted under the so-called Rockefeller drug laws, enacted
in 1973 under Gov. Nelson Rockefeller. The laws, which are the
primary cause of a sixfold growth in the state's prison population,
require long sentences for drug offenses. For example, anyone
convicted of selling as little as two ounces of cocaine, or
possessing as little as four ounces, must be sentenced to a minimum
of 15 years to life in prison, which means that the inmate becomes
eligible for parole after 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The four people granted clemency Thursday had each been
convicted of first-degree criminal sale of a controlled substance,
and sentenced to 15 years to life or 20 years to life. They have
actually served from 11 to 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we will not tolerate illegal drug dealing in New York,''
the governor said in a statement, ``we must recognize those
individuals who have paid their debt to society and have taken
substantial steps to rehabilitate themselves while incarcerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the inmates, Elaine Bartlett, 42; Jan Warren, 47; and
Arlene Oberg, 33, were among a group of four whose cause had been
taken up by Charles Grodin, the actor and talk show host, and by
Joseph Bruno, the Republican majority leader of the State Senate.
The fourth inmate was Robert Bavisotto, 50.
</P>
<P>
   Over five years, 10 of the 17 people Pataki has given clemency
to have been women, though women account for just 5 percent of the
prison population.
</P>
<P>
   After his election in 1994, Pataki said he considered the
Rockefeller drug laws too severe. But he made no move to change
them until this year, and even that proposal, which went nowhere in
the Legislature, did not reduce the mandatory minimum sentences.
Rather, it would have allowed defendants in a very limited number
of cases to appeal their sentences, and in return, the governor
demanded an end to discretionary parole, something Democrats in the
Legislature have rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of change in the drug laws complained that Pataki has
ignored the underlying issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for the governor to move on reforming the drug laws
that caused these egregious sentences in the first place,'' said
Robert Gangi, executive director of the Correctional Association of
New York, a prison policy group. ``There are hundreds of people in
the state prisons in the same position as these four individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's prisons now hold 72,000 inmates, up from 12,000 in
1973. As recently as 1980, 11 percent of the people sent to state
prisons were drug offenders; now, they are just under half the
total.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has used his clemency power at about the same rate as his
predecessor, Mario Cuomo, a Democrat who granted it to 35 people in
12 years.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the governor gave clemency to Patricia Feerick, a
former New York City police lieutenant who had been convicted of
conducting an illegal raid on two East Harlem apartments and
terrorizing their occupants. Staten Island Borough President Guy
Molinari, a Republican, had campaigned for her release.
</P>
<P>
   A grant of clemency does not automatically mean release from
prison, though historically it has worked that way in nearly all
cases. It means that the inmate immediately becomes eligible for
parole, and it is up to the parole board whether to order release.

Cowboys' path to playoffs is block by block (For use by NYTimes
News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Songs have been written about less emotion than
the roller coaster the Cowboys have endured this week.
</P>
<P>
   Defeat and despair after Sunday's shocking 22-21 loss to the New
York Jets were replaced by renewed hope and optimism when the NFL
announced Tuesday that the Cowboys indeed control their own playoff
destiny.
</P>
<P>
   According to the league's intricate tiebreaker system, all the
Cowboys (7-7) need to do to guarantee a playoff spot is win their
final two games, starting with a Christmas Eve battle at the
Superdome against the Saints (2-12).
</P>
<P>
   So never mind that the Cowboys have lost six consecutive road
games and four of their seven losses have come to teams with losing
records. There's no way they will leave the Big Easy, home of sweet
jazz and jumping zydeco, singing the blues, again.
</P>
<P>
   Right?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've still got to go play our best,'' Cowboys running back
Emmitt Smith said. ``If we don't, we'll be right back here on
Monday, singing the same old song with the same old nasty tune.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' emotions likely surged even more when they learned
that the woeful Saints, who have lost five consecutive games and 11
of the past 12, were planning to start fourth-stringer Jake
Delhomme at quarterback, making the first building block in their
playoff pyramid seemingly that much easier.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys also must conclude the season with a victory against
the New York Giants Jan. 2 at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints are first. And not only has Delhomme, a veteran of
NFL Europe, not thrown a pass in the league before, he has yet to
take a snap from an NFL center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been beaten by all kinds of quarterbacks and all kinds
of teams that we're supposed to be better than,'' Smith cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   To scale the pyramid to the playoffs by beating the Saints and
stringing together back-to-back wins with a victory against the
Giants _ and notch their first two-game winning streak since
opening the season 3-0 _ Cowboys coach Chan Gailey must rely on
building blocks that the team has rarely shown in 1999:
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said the Cowboys must depart from their penalty-plagued
ways. The Cowboys lead the league in penalties and penalty yards.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Cowboys, who rank 24th in the league in third-down
conversions, must find a way to consistently move the chains. They
have converted on just 33 percent of third downs this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys must not only make more big plays, but they must be
able to do it at crucial times, like in the red zone.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys also can't let the Saints or Giants cripple their
passing game by taking go-to wide receiver Raghib Ismail away.
Tight end David LaFleur, wide receivers Chris Brazzell and Jason
Tucker and cornerback/receiver Deion Sanders must become consistent
factors. Ismail is the only wide receiver to score a touchdown this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to execute,'' Gailey said. ``Doing all that is what I
mean by execute.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no gimmes in the NFL. Any time you don't play well
you can lose. You better be ready to play or you will get beat,
especially if you are not a dominant team. You can't play subpar
and expect to win. We should know that as much as anybody. If we
don't, then we are not smart.''
</P>
<P>
   And specifically against the Saints, the Cowboys' defense must
return to the foundation that has made them one of the league's top
units _ stopping the run and getting consistent pressure on the
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, the Saints will try to use running back Ricky Williams,
the 1998 Heisman Trophy winner from Texas, to take some of the
pressure off of Delhomme. So controlling Williams will be the key.
Once that's done, the Cowboys will look to harass Delhomme
unmercifully into making mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds simple enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, however, are taking nothing for granted against the
Saints. And not just because of the frustrations they've endured so
far in 1999. The Cowboys have vivid memories of a horrifying trip
to New Orleans last season, when the Saints blitzed a heavily
favored Cowboys team into submission in a 22-3 shellacking. Smith
was held to just 6 yards on 15 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Saints' defense is not as stout as it was a year
ago _ New Orleans has allowed at least 30 points in each of its
past five games _ the Cowboys are wary and have prepared all week
for a similar onslaught of blitzes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That does not have to be reminded to anybody,'' quarterback
Troy Aikman said. ``Those who were on the football team last year
know what happened when we went there and how disappointing that
was for us. Right now, we know what's in front of us. If we win the
next two ballgames we're in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The playoff pyramid runs through the Saints. Can the Cowboys
make the climb?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very pleased with the energy our team had in practice
this week. I thought it would be a tougher road back,'' Gailey
said. ``But once the news came in that if we win we are in, then it
was like everyone's energy level went up a notch.'' nn

NEW ORLEANS _ When the Dallas Cowboys face the New Orleans Saints
today, it will be with a bit of a hangover. It wasn't acquired on
Bourbon Street. This is of the five-day variety, a gift from the
New York Jets on Sunday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I think there is some hangover effect,'' Cowboys coach Chan
Gailey said. ``And I think any time you have a tough loss, I think
there always is. To be honest with you, if there is not some
hangover effect, you don't have the right people to a certain
degree anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys won't soon forget the Jets game. After Washington
and the New York Giants lost Sunday, the Cowboys knew by kickoff a
win would put them in good shape for another NFC East title. They
lost 22-21.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would probably agree that last week's loss was, for me
anyway, the most frustrating because of the way we lost,''
quarterback Troy Aikman said. ``And also because if we'd have won
that we would have been in the driver's seat in the division. We
had a real opportunity, and we didn't take advantage of that. It's
disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   But the math still works for the Cowboys. Two wins, and they're
in the playoffs, as division champions or as a wild card.
</P>
<P>
   They couldn't ask for a better opponent today. The Saints (2-12)
have lost their last five and 12 of their last 13. And they'll
start an NFL Europe quarterback who has not thrown a pass in the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have to play our best,'' Cowboys running back Emmitt
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty of room for improvement. Aikman and the Cowboys'
pass offense have dropped to a season-worst 25th in the NFL. Aikman
started the season with a career-best five touchdown passes at
Washington. In the 13 games since, he has thrown only 11. Only nine
teams have thrown fewer. Also, the Cowboys lead the league in
penalties (118) and penalty yards (1,054).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've got deeper issues than penalties,'' Smith said.
``We have yet to convert on third-and-short. That's been an issue.
That's been a problem. Then you add that on top of the penalties
and you have what we are right now, 7-7. In my opinion, we haven't
shown that we're a good enough team to overcome those mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Smith, who will head to another Pro Bowl in
February, has rushed for 1,165 yards and 10 touchdowns and averages
4.1 yards per carry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chances of us having a defensive game like last season are
slim and none,'' said Saints coach Mike Ditka of New Orleans' 22-3
win in which the Cowboys were held to eight yards rushing. ``Not
that we won't try. But the offense has to do their job, and the
defense has to do their job. Yeah, it would be good to stop the
running game, but I don't see that happening.''
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't seen that happen all season. The Saints, who traded
their entire draft to get Texas running back Ricky Williams, fall
near the bottom of the league in almost every category. The defense
is ranked 21st of the 31 teams. The offense is 20th.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, expected back in the lineup after a four-week absence,
has suffered injuries to his left ankle, right elbow and left big
toe.
</P>
<P>
   But the passing game frustrates Ditka the most. Ditka will try
yet another quarterback this week. Fourth-stringer Jake Delhomme, a
second-year player out of Southwestern Louisiana (now
Louisiana-Lafayette), will be the seventh starting quarterback in
Ditka's three seasons in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friday can't get here fast enough,'' Delhomme said. ``It's a
dream come true to play on national TV against the Cowboys. If I go
out and have fun, we're going to have fun, play loose and just let
it go. I'm not looking at this as pressure.''

KINGS KEEP AN EYE ON OILERS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Kings held their final practice on Thursday at Iceoplex
before the two-day Christmas break. They will not reassemble until
the morning before Sunday's game against Pacific Division leading
Phoenix, but coach Andy Murray also has his mind on another team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are only three points ahead of Edmonton for the eighth and
final playoff spot,'' he said. ``We are taking them very seriously.
They struggled early in the season and we have been struggling.
It's exciting, but it's better when you build yourself a little
room.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the Kings had a 12-point lead on Edmonton, which
faced Northwest Division rival Calgary on Thursday night. The Kings
were 10 points ahead of the Mighty Ducks and eight in front of the
defending Stanley Cup champion Dallas Stars.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings and Ducks now are tied for last in the Pacific with 39
points, but both would qualify for the postseason if the season
ended today.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Kings were outscored 23-8 in a three-game
stretch last week, Phoenix also dropped five of six before routing
the Ducks 8-2 on Wednesday. The Coyotes came into that game after
losing 6-0 to St. Louis at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is consistency,'' said captain Rob
Blake. ``You see how tight everything is. You need to come out
every night with a strong effort. We played better (Wednesday vs.
San Jose) but we still lost. Playing better doesn't mean anything
unless you win.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the lopsided victory at Anaheim, the Coyotes remain on
shaky ground. They learned Wednesday they will lose veteran second
line left-winger Greg Adams for four weeks after undergoing surgery
for his sinuses.
</P>
<P>
   Adams was named the top player against the Ducks when he had two
goals and one assist.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!All-Star voting:!off! A poor showing the past week plus a
season of injuries will not help the Kings get players into the
Feb.6 All-Star game at Toronto between North American players and
Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   Ziggy Palffy, among the league scoring leaders until missing
four games with a bad back, should make the European squad. But
Michigan-native Bryan Smolinski, who has 33 points in 34 games
including a goal Wednesday, it not even listed in the top 15 on the
North American club. Blake is second in voting (298,466) for North
America. Left winger Luc Robitaille (167,603) is
seventh.!dlim!!end! &QL;

EDITORIAL: THE EXPANDING REACH OF CIVIL RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Dec. 24:
</P>
<P>
   For people who cared about civil rights and civil liberties,
America at midcentury was a forbidding place. Demagogues and Cold
War politics threatened freedom of speech. Racial discrimination
was rampant, separate-but-equal the law of the land in education.
Women were equal at the polling booth but not in the workplace. It
was not uncommon for people to be convicted on illegally obtained
evidence, without the aid of counsel. There were no class-action
lawsuits to protect the environment from commercial exploitation or
consumers from dangerous products.
</P>
<P>
   It is worth reflecting, at the eve of the millennium, on the
historic revolution in law that has made the United States a freer
and more hospitable nation. This was a revolution of attorneys,
judges and courageous ordinary citizens, all seeking to move the
nation closer to the ideals of freedom, justice and equality. It
was a rapid revolution, achieving astonishing gains in an
astonishingly short span of time. It was and is an unfinished
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution and the Bill of Rights established the basic
principles of free expression, equal justice, due process and
privacy, and wisely put them beyond the reach of whatever
transitory majorities should happen to hold Congress or the White
House. But these rights are not self-enforcing. Making them a
reality requires individuals with the skill and determination to
use the law's majestic machinery by bringing cases that expose the
great gulf between the high-mindedness of the Constitution and the
injustices of everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   Thus it was that in the 1930s the legal arm of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People began plotting a
litigation strategy to force the courts to confront head-on the
evils of official racism. Propelled by Charles Houston, William
Henry Hastie and Thurgood Marshall, this effort eventually led to a
momentous Supreme Court decision, Brown vs. Board of Education,
that finally broke the back of official segregation. From Brown vs.
Board flowed a robust civil rights movement and, in time, a giant
wave of equal rights legislation that even a Congress
disproportionately influenced by old-guard Southerners could not
resist.
</P>
<P>
   Thus it was, too, that in 1920 a visionary non-lawyer named
Roger Baldwin founded the American Civil Liberties Union, the first
permanent organization dedicated to vigorous defense of the Bill of
Rights, especially freedom of speech. One of the group's early
actions was to recruit Clarence Darrow to defend John Scopes, a
young Tennessee schoolteacher who dared defy that state's law
against teaching Darwin's theory of evolution. That famous case, a
legal loss but a public relations triumph, was a precursor to
current fights over the teaching of creationism in public school
science classes _ proof of the old edict that civil liberties
battles never stay won.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the Supreme Court's new openness on civil rights,
ACLU attorneys set out to extend the reach of the Bill of Rights to
new groups and subject areas. This effort, since joined by other
organizations and other lawyers, has helped improve prison
conditions, reduce unnecessary government secrecy and achieve
significant advances for women's rights, children in foster care
and the mentally ill. In a similar spirit, public-interest law
firms and conservation groups, given new weapons by the landmark
environmental statutes of the late 1960s and early 1970s, have been
instrumental in enforcing those laws, often in the face of fierce
resistance by the very government agencies entrusted with carrying
them out.
</P>
<P>
   It has become fashionable to depict the proliferation of lawyers
and lawsuits as something negative _ both symptom and cause of a
self-indulgent ``culture of rights.'' This fashion may pass. At the
moment, though, Congress and the current Supreme Court seem
determined to exploit this misconception in mischievous ways _ by
elevating states' rights over the legitimate power of the national
government to address national problems, or by restricting the
jurisdiction of federal courts to hear certain cases, including the
habeas corpus appeals of death-penalty inmates.
</P>
<P>
   It is true, of course, that periods of social change like the
one America has been going through for half a century will produce
excesses and mistakes. Remedies may not work as intended. But such
failings call for thoughtful refinements, not retrenchment. The
challenge of the new millennium is to build upon the remarkable
legal gains of the past half-century, and to broaden access to a
fair and independent court system that made that progress possible.

A FIREBRAND WHO SEEMED TO LOSE HIS SPARK
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)   (With NY-CREW-EDUC, NY-CREW-MAYOR) 
(rk) 
 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just a year ago, Rudy Crew seemed poised to be the
first chancellor in years to make a lasting difference on New York
City's public schools. From the time he arrived from the
comparatively tiny Tacoma, Wash., embraced by almost everyone in
New York's troubled and politically divided system, he promised
quick results and often seemed to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   He wrested substantial control from corrupt and incompetent
community school boards. He talked about setting higher standards.
He ousted bad principals and took over schools that had abjectly
failed their children, promising to turn them around. He gave hope
that one man could move a huge bureaucracy to new heights.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, after months of Hamletlike indecision, the one-time
giant came crashing down, after his own board rejected his plea for
public affirmation as symbolized by his request for a long-term
contract, more money and higher benefits. As he fell _ going from
hero to a figure some saw as tragic _ he was publicly excoriated by
some politicians and board members who had once been his
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   As word of his ouster became public Thursday, virtually no one _
from parents at the schoolhouse gate to union leaders to academics
and educators _ publicly begged him to stay. In seclusion with his
children in his official town house in Brooklyn Thursday, he stood
alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's real sad,'' said Arthur Levine, the president of
Teachers College at Columbia University and a sometime Crew
confidant. ``I'm still a very big fan of his. There aren't a lot of
excellent urban school superintendents in America, and I thought
New York had the best.''
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath, there are two views of what happened. One
espoused by Crew and his associates is that in standing up for
public education _ opposing the national movement toward school
vouchers and warning of the risks of charter schools _ he became
the target of Gov. George Pataki and, more importantly, of Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, who controlled a majority of votes on the Board
of Education.
</P>
<P>
   The other view is that he came in with a grand vision of taking
control of the city's huge school system, executed it through pure
chutzpah and a network of unions and legislators, then tripped over
the delicate and difficult work of taking his hard-won powers and
improving the schools.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever led to his demise, supporters and detractors all
say that with more political skill and sheer stomach for the fight,
Crew could have salvaged his job. Giuliani, his aides say, was
genuinely torn about Crew, and was looking for signals that the
chancellor was willing to work with him. The mayor had hounded out
a previous chancellor, Ramon Cortines, and a popular police
commissioner, William Bratton, and did not want to be perceived
again as a bully, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My perspective on the fall is that he brought this on
himself,'' said Raymond Domanico, education adviser for the Metro
Industrial Areas Foundation. ``I think to all observers he's been
drifting for a while, and his unwillingness to make a strong
commitment alienated sufficient numbers of the board to lead to his
downfall.''

ON SECOND OUTING, ASTRONAUTS CONTINUE UPGRADE OF TELESCOPE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 3rd graf for update on time of spacwalk) (th) 
 By WARREN E. LEARY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Hubble Space Telescope got smarter and better able
to point at distant astronomical targets on Thursday as
spacewalking astronauts replaced two major pieces of the
observatory's gear.
</P>
<P>
   On the second spacewalk of the shuttle Discovery's Hubble repair
mission, the astronauts, C. Michael Foale and Claude Nicollier,
swapped out the observatory's central computer and one of its fine
guidance sensors, a precision pointing device.
</P>
<P>
   The spacewalkers ventured into Discovery's cargo bay, where
Hubble towers almost four stories above, at 2:06 p.m. EST, about 45
minutes earlier than scheduled, to get a jump on their busy day of
replacing some of the telescope's most important components. The
spacewalk lasted 8 hours and 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The excursion followed the first spacewalk by Steven L. Smith
and John M. Grunsfeld on Wednesday. They replaced Hubble's six
stabilizing gyroscopes, the focus of the mission, and added
protective devices to the observatory's six aging batteries to
prevent them from overheating and overcharging.
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials said Thursday that initial tests of the
gyroscopes and the voltage-temperature improvement kits for the
batteries showed that they were properly installed and in good
working order.
</P>
<P>
   John Campbell, NASA's Hubble program manager, declared the
repair mission's objectives 80 percent complete with the success of
the first spacewalk. Hubble, scheduled to be released by Discovery
on Christmas Day, should be back on the job making scientific
observations about two weeks later, Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   In the second of three scheduled spacewalks, Foale and Nicollier
got to work immediately upon exiting the shuttle, which was flying
above Australia at the time.
</P>
<P>
   For Nicollier, a Swiss astronaut with the European Space Agency
who has flown on three previous shuttle flights, including the
first Hubble service mission in 1993, it was his first spacewalk,
or EVA (for extra-vehicular activity) in NASA terminology.
``Welcome to the EVA fraternity,'' said Smith from inside
Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great privilege to work on Hubble for the astronomical
community all over the world,'' said Nicollier, an astrophysicist,
after first exclaiming, ``What a view!''
</P>
<P>
   Foale, a veteran of five previous shuttle flights and two
earlier spacewalks, led the effort to extract Hubble's central
computer while positioned on a workstation at the end of the
shuttle's 50-foot robot arm. It took more than two hours to replace
the computer and move to the next task, but the astronauts soon got
confirmation that they had succeeded when Mission Control said
initial tests showed that the computer was functioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hubble not only has new brains, it's thinking,'' said
Steven Robinson, mission communicator at the Johnson Space Center
here.
</P>
<P>
   While the new computer is a big improvement for Hubble, having
20 times the speed and six times the memory of the old one, it is
hardly state-of-the-art by current personal computer standards.
</P>
<P>
   Hubble's new brain is powered by an Intel 486-DX2 chip running
at a speed of 25 megahertz, a processor long obsolete in desktop
computers now driven by newer Pentium chips. NASA officials said
computer chips used in space must be specially manufactured and
tested to work in that harsh environment, which keeps them
generations behind what is used on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to keep in mind that we don't do Windows, we don't
have disks and we don't do the Internet,'' Campbell explained,
jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   Following the computer work, the astronauts tackled the
laborious task of exchanging a bulky Fine Guidance Sensor, one of
three optical devices used for precision pointing and measurement.
</P>
<P>
   The 480-pound device is one that was removed during the second
Hubble servicing mission in 1997 and refurbished.
</P>
<P>
   With Nicollier working on the robot arm, the spacewalkers
removed an older sensor and tried to slide the new one into place
along a set of guiderails.
</P>
<P>
   The new unit initially stuck part way into its slot. After
discussion with ground controllers, the astronauts removed it and
were successful on the second attempt. Early tests indicated that
the replacement was working as planned, mission officials said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The old guidance sensor was stowed on the shuttle and will be
refurbished for reinstallation on the telescope during a service
mission planned for 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's walk in space is to be the only one for Foale and
Nicollier during this mission. When the mission was planned, the
pair had been scheduled to make another excursion, but that EVA was
canceled when Discovery's much delayed flight was cut from 10 to
eight days.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Grunsfeld are to make the third and final spacewalk of
the mission on Friday, when they will replace a faulty radio
transmitter and exchange a tape data recorder with a solid-state
model. The telescope is scheduled to be released into space on
Saturday. Discovery is set to return to Earth on Monday.

MENTAL CARE FOR CHILDREN IS THE SUBJECT OF A LAWSUIT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ALAN FEUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Legal Aid Society has filed a class action
lawsuit accusing New York state's mental health system of letting
hundreds of severely mentally ill children languish in hospitals,
juvenile jails and foster care homes instead of providing them with
a place in community-based mental health centers.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, which was filed on Wednesday in U.S. District Court in
Brooklyn, contends that the state's Department of Health and Office
of Mental Health said about 400 children with illnesses ranging
from schizophrenia to severe depression should be allowed to enter
the centers, known as residential treatment centers, but then kept
them on waiting lists, sometimes for more than a year, until spaces
opened up.
</P>
<P>
   The suit seeks a court order that would compel the state to put
all eligible children in residential centers within 30 days of
their being accepted for admission.
</P>
<P>
   Mental health officials and advocates agree that the state's
network of treatment centers is filled to capacity, but state
officials would not comment Thursday on the state's plans to create
additional space.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children bringing this lawsuit are some of the most
gravely mentally ill young people imaginable,'' said Monica
Drinane, the lawyer in charge of the Legal Aid Society's juvenile
rights division. ``The state has recognized this by accepting them
for its therapeutic residential programs. The painful irony is that
at the same time the state promises this help, it does not have,
and never has had, nearly enough of these placements to meet the
demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Kenny, a spokesman for the Health Department, said officials
had not yet received the court papers and could not comment on the
lawsuit. Jill Daniels, a spokeswoman for the Office of Mental
Health, also would not comment on the suit because officials had
not yet seen the papers.
</P>
<P>
   New York's 19 residential treatment centers are generally
considered to be the first place children with severe mental
ailments go after being discharged from more traditional
psychiatric hospitals. Run by nonprofit corporations but regulated
by the state, the treatment centers are typically staffed by
full-time nurses and social workers and part-time psychiatrists.
</P>
<P>
   But mental health advocates say programs for children,
particularly those like residential treatment centers, have been
given short shrift in the larger debate over the soundness of the
state's mental health system, largely because adult mental health
concerns dominate policy and planning efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of mental health services for adults has attracted
increased attention in recent months in particular because of the
case of Andrew Goldstein, a schizophrenic man who shoved a
32-year-old woman, Kendra Webdale, in front of a New York City
subway train last January, killing her.
</P>
<P>
   In the 2000 fiscal year, state mental health officials are
expected to spend about $228 million on programs for children, or
about 5 percent of the total budget of $4.2 billion _ even though
children 18 years old or younger make up about 25 percent of the
state's population, according to a report released this month by
the Citizens' Committee for Children of New York, an advocacy
group.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Gov. George Pataki unveiled a sweeping plan to halt
the longstanding practice of emptying the state's huge psychiatric
hospitals and called for spending an additional $125 million on
services for the mentally ill. While nearly 30 percent of the
additional spending package, or $36.2 million, has been earmarked
for children's mental health services, advocates say it is not
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as if we don't support the governor's initiative _ we
do,'' Ms. Drinane said. ``Realistically, though, it's not broad
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The class action filed by the Legal Aid Society, which
represents children in the child welfare system, does not overtly
seek additional money from the Pataki administration. But Ms.
Drinane said that in order to comply with the suit's demand that
children be moved promptly into residential treatment centers,
``the state is going to have to fund more beds.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials refused to comment on whether there was money
available to pay for more beds. But Mary Abrams, executive director
of the New York State Coalition for Children's Mental Health
Services, the trade association that represents the state's
residential treatment centers, said she planned to give the state a
year to see if the governor's new spending initiative would solve
the problem.

MAPLE LEAFS TOP DEVILS, 4-1 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TORONTO _ This habit of losing the second of back-to-back games
has reached epidemic proportions for the New Jersey Devils. They
have played eight such games this season and have lost every one,
and by at least two goals. They suffered their eighth such loss on
Thursday night by 4-1 to the Toronto Maple Leafs, one of the
National Hockey League's elite teams again this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils have lost such games even to lowly teams, with last
Sunday's loss to the New York Islanders and to Calgary earlier this
month the most vivid examples. It was after the loss to the
Islanders that several players, but not Coach Robbie Ftorek, said
they had a problem with the second of back-to-back games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't play back-to-back games,'' Ftorek said tonight when
asked to analyze the reasons for this phenomenon. ``We play one
game at a time. I don't know why you keep beating a dead horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Claude Lemieux, Lyle Odelein and Bobby Holik are three of the
players who have said the Devils had addressed the problem in team
meetings and private conversations in small groups. ``We talked
about it the last couple of days,'' Lemieux said before Thursday
night's game. ``Your legs can be going like crazy and you're
working hard, but if your brain is not working, it's all for
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux scored the goal for the Devils (19-12-3-2), who took 32
shots against Curtis Joseph at the Air Canada Center but had only a
handful of quality chances. Holik had five shots at Joseph, four in
the third period when the Devils showed signs of fatigue, perhaps
from beating the Philadelphia Flyers a night earlier in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux has been the most consistent goal scorer in recent games
for the Devils. He took the team lead in goals with 12 when he
opened the scoring on Thursday night with his fifth goal in the
past five games, 8 minutes 23 seconds into the game. Lemieux got
his goal when he skated into the slot and deflected Odelein's shot
from the right point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were doing O.K. until they scored that short-handed goal,''
Holik said of Igor Korolev's goal, which tied the game with 3:55
left in the first period. ``We played good for 20 minutes and then
we took some penalties.''
</P>
<P>
   The Maple Leafs (22-11-4-2) also got goals from Nik Antropov,
Jonas Hoglund and Dmitri Khristich for their fifth consecutive
victory. They took 20 shots against Martin Brodeur.
</P>
<P>
   There was little Brodeur could do on Antropov's fifth goal of
the season with 7:11 left in the second period, or on Hoglund's
power-play goal just over two minutes later that gave the Maple
Leafs a two-goal lead. Both scorers were wide open when they took
their shots.

RECORDS SHOW KC OFFICIALS KNEW BRIDGE WAS LIKELY HAZARD IN FLOODING
BEFORE 7 DEATHS IN '98 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. - Months before floodwater swept seven persons
to their deaths off the Prospect Avenue Bridge on Oct. 4, 1998,
Kansas City officials knew the span was a likely hazard during
heavy flooding but did not tell the city's emergency managers,
court records filed Thursday show.
</P>
<P>
   The records, filed in Jackson County Circuit Court as part of a
civil lawsuit against the city, include memos written after the
flood, which killed 11 persons throughout the Kansas City area, and
excerpts from a deposition with the city's emergency management
coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   The memos suggest that city officials had learned the summer
before the flood that computer models had identified the bridge as
a potential hazard. Deposition excerpts show the city's emergency
management coordinator was not told of the threat ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom at City Hall before the flood was that
channel work completed since 1977 had virtually eliminated the
threat of dangerous flooding along Brush Creek. But even though
preliminary computer modeling challenged that belief, the city did
little to address an immediate threat, lawyers argue.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney David Smith, who filed the documents on behalf of
families who lost relatives on the bridge, said that, used
properly, the hazard information on the bridge could have saved
seven lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had five minutes and one barricade, that's where they
would have placed it,'' Smith said in an interview. ``This modeling
study showed them exactly where they needed to go. There wasn't any
guesswork. It would have prevented all those people who died on the
bridge from driving on the bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for the city and its employees, City Manager Bob
Collins declined to comment on Thursday's filings, saying that
neither he nor the city's lawyers had yet reviewed them.
</P>
<P>
   He said, however, that the city was working hard to correct
existing flood hazards along Brush Creek.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of places that are still floodable,''
Collins said. ``Not all of the improvements were available at that
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the flood, the city and the Fire Department have moved to
improve emergency planning and eliminate flood hazards along Brush
Creek, including laying plans to remove and replace the Prospect
bridge.
</P>
<P>
   In an Oct. 28, 1998, memo to Laurie Spoon-Potter, press aide to
then-Mayor Emanuel Cleaver, Public Works Director Ed Wolf said that
computer modeling had shown the bridge to be at risk during heavy
flooding.
</P>
<P>
   ``This computer modeling has not yet been completed, but
preliminary results which became available this summer did show
that the water level during a major flood event such as the one we
had in 1977 and similar to the one that we had on Oct. 4 would be
over the Prospect Avenue Bridge,'' Wolf wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf noted that the city responded to the threat in summer 1998
by opening negotiations with the state to share the cost of
removing and replacing the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The memo was written in response to questions from constituents
who had called the mayor's office seeking help in recovering from
the flood.
</P>
<P>
   Spoon-Potter, who no longer works for the city, said copies of
Wolf's memo were distributed to staff in the mayor's office to help
them answer questions from the public. She said she did not
distribute it to reporters covering the flood aftermath because
they didn't ask for it. She said she didn't recall reading it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do constituent services, but I probably wouldn't have
read it because my focus was (reporters),'' Spoon-Potter said. ``If
you guys weren't asking for it, I wasn't focusing on it because it
wasn't part of my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he hadn't seen the modeling studies Wolf described in
his memo, but had asked the city for them.
</P>
<P>
   One person who said she didn't see the preliminary hazard
reports before the flood was Julie Llorente, the city's emergency
management coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Llorente, who was employed by the Fire Department, said she
first learned of the modeling at her deposition in the civil case
last June.
</P>
<P>
   During the deposition, she acknowledged that such information
could have been valuable had she known it before the flood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had you had that information, ma'am, would you have done
anything differently, with regard to your job as the emergency
preparedness coordinator, on Oct. 4, 1998?'' a lawyer asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe reminded people, the fire chief specifically, that they
thought there might be a problem,'' Llorente replied. ``I don't
really know. It's hard to say what...''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's information you would have liked to have had on Oct. 4,
1998, that (the) Prospect bridge was a dangerous spot?'' the lawyer
followed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably would have been good to know that, yes,'' Llorente
said.
</P>
<P>
   That day, the National Weather Service issued a warning of
imminent flash flooding about 3 p.m. Almost 3 inches of rain fell
in the Brush Creek watershed between 7 and 8 p.m. Friends and
relatives of the seven who perished said the victims were swept
from the tops of their cars and into the creek about 8:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   After the flood, articles in The Kansas City Star revealed that
an unplugged radio decoder had crippled an electronic flood-warning
system on Brush Creek, that the city never had budgeted money to
maintain the system and that the city had no contingency plans for
flooding on the creek.
</P>
<P>
   A subsequent report by City Auditor Mark Funkhouser spurred
further improvements in the city's emergency planning, including
elevating Llorente to the city manager's office to better
coordinate citywide disaster response.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's filing was a change in strategy for lawyers
representing the families of those killed on the bridge. In an
amended lawsuit, the families argue that by systematically ignoring
the possibility of deadly flooding on Brush Creek, the city
violated their loved ones' constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
   Such an argument could force the case out of state court and
into federal court. If successful, the move also could remove a
$100,000 cap on damages the city could pay to the families of each
victim.
</P>
<P>
   The families combined now are seeking more than $100 million in
damages.

FAA APPROVES CLOSING OF RICHARDS-GEBAUR AIRPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DONALD BRADLEY and ROBERT CARROLL  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The runway lights at Richards-Gebaur Memorial
Airport could go dark Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday granted Kansas
City permission to close the airport to make way for an intermodal
rail hub operated by Kansas City Southern Railway.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council must approve the closing first. Councilwoman
Teresa Loar, chairwoman of the Aviation Committee, said Thursday
that she was confident approval would come early next week, perhaps
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   So on the final day of the year, the airport that opened in 1941
and later served 40 years as an Air Force base, is expected to
close to air traffic.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Russell Widmar, Kansas City aviation director,
the FAA wrote that Kansas City ``is hereby released from its
obligations to maintain the Richards-Gebaur Memorial Airport
property for aeronautical use.''
</P>
<P>
   The approval is based partly on Kansas City's commitment to
study options for a replacement airfield in the area.
</P>
<P>
   City officials praised the FAA's decision. Since well before
voters approved the project in August, officials had been
frustrated by opponents who fought to keep the airport open.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a long time coming, but we are ready to move,'' Loar
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are delighted _ it's what we expected,'' said Phil Brown,
deputy director of the city's Aviation Department.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents were not ready to fold.
</P>
<P>
   Tim McDermott, president of Friends of Richards-Gebaur Airport,
vowed Thursday to continue the fight, perhaps with a lawsuit or
another petition. An earlier petition led to an election in August
in which voters approved the intermodal plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``By no means are we ready to give up,'' McDermott said.
</P>
<P>
   His stance did not surprise Loar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The few in opposition will continue to try and stop this,''
Loar said. ``But the citizens have voted. The council has voted,
and now the FAA has given approval.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the new leases held no surprises, but he did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   In granting approval, FAA officials cited an Aug. 6, 1999,
letter from Mayor Kay Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, Barnes told the FAA that the city intended to
proceed with a plan for a replacement airport at or near the
Richards-Gebaur site.
</P>
<P>
   Loar recently said the FAA's approval had been delayed by
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the way government works,'' she said. ``And it's slow
going when you have to work with so many agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for Kansas City Southern to operate a
rail-to-truck freight facility at the airport site. Trains from
Mexico would arrive at the intermodal hub, and the goods would be
transported to trucks for delivery elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents called the arrangement was a ``sweetheart deal'' for
Kansas City Southern and said that the city was throwing away a
perfectly good airport. They also said the city's freeway system
would wilt under additional truck traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters countered that the city could not afford not to take
advantage of its location on the so-called ``NAFTA Highway.'' They
contend that the intermodal hub could make Kansas City a major
player in international trade.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's FAA approval came none too soon for supporters.
</P>
<P>
   There was concern that Kansas City Southern might abandon the
plan if FAA approval was delayed much longer. The railroad had made
clear its desire to have a car-handling facility in operation for
Mazda in April.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Southern official Warren Erdman had said earlier
that the railroad had no date at which it would abandon the
project, but, ``obviously the longer the wait, the less optimistic
you become.''
</P>
<P>
   Erdman could not be reached Thursday for comment.

COUNTDOWN OF THE COUNTDOWNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On a scale of 1-to-10, the quality and variety of
the media-generated sports-related end of the
year/decade/century/millennium lists we've sifted through in 1999
has been a rather unresounding 5.
</P>
<P>
   Which is the number of lists we actually found interesting
enough to read all the way through.
</P>
<P>
   As much as folks complain about the abundance of them, the
gripes might be better aimed at the lack of inspiration that seems
to drive these lists. With our inherent need to organize and
prioritize, why do most of these lists seem so sanitized?
</P>
<P>
   Probably because they've been group efforts. Publications and TV
networks get input from a huge panel of in-house voters, which may
turn out to be more fair and representative _ and avoid the
embarrassment of things falling through the cracks _ but the
results are without much passion. The Associated Press has been
cranking out sport-by-sport top-athlete lists lately, but their
strange-sized body of ``expert'' voters ends up with strange
compromises.
</P>
<P>
   In making our list of the best lists this year, based on
entertainment and information value plus the ability to make us sit
and think, we're going with this notable five:
</P>
<P>
   1. The Hockey News' 100 Most Colorful People in Hockey: Think of
how this idea could have been carried for any other sport _
baseball might have a top 1,000 list. That's why doing it with a
sport treated so reverentially it's a blast to find those who
rocked the boat and got away with it.
</P>
<P>
   Topping this list in the Dec. 24 issue is Eddie ``The
Entertainer'' Shack. Ever heard of him? This part-timer for the
1965-66 Maple Leafs even had a song named for him called ``Clear
The Track, Here Comes Shack'' (not to give any certain Lakers
center any ideas). That song was atop the Toronto Top 40 charts for
nine straight weeks, ahead of anything by the Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 is much more familiar _ the Carlson Brothers of the
Johnstown Jets, who inspired the Hansen Brothers of ``Slap Shot.''
The list also has the imagination to include two fictional TV
characters No. 27 (Eddie Lebec, the Jay Thomas character from
``Cheers'' who played goalie for the Boston Bruins) and No. 79
(NBC's Peter Puck), plus former Kings owner Bruce ``Brucie
Bigbucks'' McNall at No. 73.
</P>
<P>
   2. Keith Olbermann's ``Real'' 50 Greatest Athletes of the
Century: Inspired by the haphazard way in which his former
employer, ESPN, did its week-by-week horn-tooting over its
SportsCentury Greatest Athletes project, historian Olbermann
responded with his own compilation for Fox.
</P>
<P>
   First, he announced the guidelines, which ESPN never did. For
example, there are no horses for Olbermann because ``these must be
athletes who compete voluntarily.'' Social impact is considered as
much if not more than pure athletic ability _ ``sheer greatness''
counts the most.
</P>
<P>
   His list included George Mikan, Arthur Ashe, Steffi Graf, Pele,
Pete Maravich and Greg LeMond. ESPN had none of them in its top
100. ESPN's possible Nos. 1 and 2 guys, Muhammad Ali and Michael
Jordan, are Nos. 7 and 6 on Olbermann's list.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Olbermann finished his list by anointing Jackie
Robinson as his No. 1 guy (ESPN had Robinson at No. 15). As
Olbermann wondered: ``How much better might he have been had there
been no color line, or he had not been the first, or if even the
pressure been just a little less... or if he had not pursued his
fifth-best sport?''
</P>
<P>
   Olbermann's list can be found online
(http://foxsports.com/columns/olbermann50/) with a special on Fox
Sports Net at 7 p.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   3. The Sporting News 100 Most Powerful People in Sports for the
20th Century: The Dec. 22 issue, which revealed its annual power
ranking, went another step and challenged itself to do a century
list. Former NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle came out on top.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, it also took the time to explain that its
definition of power meant someone who has the capability to effect
significant change _ or prevent significant change. Its subtly
different from ``influence'' and shouldn't be mistaken with
``innovative,'' ``popular,'' ``famous'' or winning championships.
</P>
<P>
   By that, we have people like Branch Rickey (No. 4) preceding
Jackie Robinson (No. 21). And there's Al Davis (No. 31), Howard
Cosell (No. 47), and Don King (No. 49) getting their due as well,
like 'em or not.
</P>
<P>
   4. Sports Illustrated's Top 50 athletes by state vs. USA Today's
Top five athletes state-by-state: Both lists came out this week.
Put 'em side by side, and it's one big mess Rand McNally couldn't
clean up.
</P>
<P>
   In its Dec. 27 year-end double issue, SI has decided that an
athlete should be designated to a state where they first showed
flashes of greatness. USA Today's list, compiled by freelance
writer Lance Gould for Wednesday's edition, stays true to actual
birthplace.
</P>
<P>
   Which means Granada Hills-reared John Elway is No. 8 on SI's
California poll, but No. 1 in USA Today's Washington poll since
that happened to be the place where his parents lived when he was
born. It also creates wackiness like Joe Louis scoring No. 1 on
SI's Michigan list and Carl Lewis landing No. 1 on SI's New Jersey
list, but USA Today put both of them in Alabama _ Louis (No. 3) and
Lewis (No. 5) behind Hank Aaron and Jesse Owens with Willie Mays in
at No. 4.
</P>
<P>
   5. The National Examiner's Top 100 Scandals of the Century: O.J.
Simpson's domestic situation came in second. Tied. With Bill
Clinton and Monica Lewinsky. What could have possibly been bigger?
The editors decided it was when Eddie Fisher left Debbie Reynolds
to marry her best friend Elizabeth Taylor in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Egads.
</P>
<P>
   The sports crimes and misdemeanors that were crazy enough to
make this list are impressive _ the Black Sox Scandal (No. 11),
Tonya Harding-Nancy Kerrigan (No. 24), Jim Thorpe stripped of his
Olympic gold medals for having played semi-pro baseball (No. 35),
Marv Albert's sexcapades (No. 36) and Mike Tyson's rape conviction
(No. 98).
</P>
<P>
   Vanessa Williams, who recently married Lakers forward Rick Fox,
came in at No. 92. But for much different reasons. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SMOKES
</P>
<P>
   _After exhaustive research through memorabilia stores, personal
collections and library files, we've found our Sports Illustrated
cover of the century: July 14, 1969 featuring O.J. Simpson under
the headline ``To Play or Not to Play?: O.J. Cools It In
Hollywood.'' He just won the Heisman Trophy at USC, but was already
holding out from the NFL's Buffalo Bills, who drafted him.
According to Frank Deford's story inside headlined ``Ready If You
Are, O.J.,'' Juice was considering a full-time acting career if the
Bills didn't come up with the bills. Deford writes that Simpson was
acting in ``a new CBS-TV series with the stirring title of `Medical
Center''' as he waited to see if the Bills would meet his demand
for a five-year, $650,000 deal, plus a $500,000 loan. Bills owner
Ralph Wilson countered with a $250,000 deal over five years. Deford
quotes Juice's response: ``I don't like to be pushed.'' &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES
</P>
<P>
   _Oliver Stone says you'll never watch football the same after
enduring his much-hyped flick ``Any Given Sunday,'' which came out
Wednesday, but that's ground that NFL Films already covered 20
years ago. The hits, the grunts, the violent body slams _ it's like
one long MTV music video that is definitely a visual and audio
thrill ride for a big screen. But does it make some sort of
statement? Hardly. For as much controversy as it stirred up in its
creative process, there's nothing more here than stylistic
mishmash, trying to get you to believe the Miami Sharks are an NFL
team in the legacy of Lombardi instead of some old USFL team.
Considering Stone plasters his own mug throughout as a TV analyst
(occasionally throwing down some hard liquor and high-fiving the
play-by-play man), the real conspiracy here is how he continues to
make these vanity movies palatable to the public. In this case,
it's the audience participation in trying to identify as many
ex-NFLers and other celebrities as can possibly be crammed into one
movie. Oh, and for a post script: There's not enough Jamie Fox
throwing up. &QL; 
_Our first clue that ESPN's SportsCentury list will be topped by
Muhammad Ali is that ESPN Classic airs the six-part, seven-hour
original production ``The Fights and Times of Muhammad Ali'' on
Christmas Day from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. ESPN's profile of Nos. 3 and 4
are today from 7-8 p.m., while Nos. 2 and 1 air on an ABC special
Sunday at 5 p.m. &QL;

LOSS OF CAR ADDS TO PAIN OF WIDOW AND HER GRANDCHILDREN

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Last week Jewel Napier lost her husband to
diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   This week she almost lost his cremated remains when a thief
stole her car.
</P>
<P>
   The thieves burned the 1997 Dodge Neon, leaving it a total loss.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters found the flaming car Wednesday and extinguished
the blaze. Her husband's remains were not damaged, but Napier now
is left to raise two grandchildren by herself with no car.
</P>
<P>
   She owes more on the car than it is worth, and her husband had
no life insurance when he died, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple had been married 20 years. Jim Napier, 57, was
diagnosed with diabetes after a stroke in 1992 and retired early.
</P>
<P>
   He cared for two grandchildren, now ages 7 and 8, when their
mother no longer could. Jewel Napier, 63, held a full-time job as a
housekeeper and nanny as well as baby-sitting jobs on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the primary child-care giver,'' Napier said. ``He did
really well with them.''
</P>
<P>
   But his condition worsened, and he began dialysis in August. He
died unexpectedly in his sleep Dec. 12.
</P>
<P>
   He had always told his wife he did not want a big funeral. He
just wanted to be cremated. As it turned out, she could not afford
a big funeral anyway.
</P>
<P>
   She had him cremated and took his remains last weekend to
Buckner, where she staged a memorial at a nephew's house. Napier
returned from the trip to her house in the area of 25th Street and
Hardesty Avenue with the cremains in the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why I left the cremains in the trunk,'' she said.
``I guess I didn't even think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she planned to bury the cremains in her in-laws' plot
in Excelsior Springs around the time of her husband's birthday in
April.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday morning, the car, with the remains, was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in a panic,'' Napier said. ``It was just the thought of
not knowing where his remains were.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday firefighters were called to a burning car at 22nd
Street and Denver Avenue. It was towed to the city's salvage lot,
and police called Napier.
</P>
<P>
   The cremains were intact because the fire had not reached the
trunk.
</P>
<P>
   Napier's financial situation has friends worried. She works as a
housekeeper and nanny for Jackson County Circuit Judge Jay
Daugherty and his wife, Lyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine all these terrible things happening to her all
at once,'' Lyn Daugherty said.
</P>
<P>
   The Daughertys are working through their church to set up a fund
for Napier. The Rev. Robert Cueni at the Country Club Christian
Church is overseeing the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a wonderful person,'' Lyn Daugherty said. ``We call her
Our Jewel. She's always donating things to people even though she
doesn't have much herself. Folks at her church donate clothes for
the grandchildren, and when they're finished with the clothes, she
always tries to recycle them to someone else needy.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Napier even donated all of her husband's medical
equipment to a needy woman at church the day after he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's always thinking of others, even at this difficult time
in her life.''

ISLANDERS GAIN BRAGGING RIGHTS OVER RANGERS WITH A GAME TO BOAST
ABOUT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Although the New York Rangers have not been
very good in recent seasons, their fans could always say that at
least they were better than the New York Islanders. Almost everyone
else in the NH L was better than the Islanders, so why should their
nearest neighbors be any different?
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, with about half the capacity crowd at Nassau
Coliseum cheering for each team, the Islanders finally were better
than the Rangers. For the first time in their last nine meetings,
the Islanders emerged with a victory, this one by a score of 4-2.
In the other eight games, the Rangers have seven victories and
there has been one tie.
</P>
<P>
   Claude Lapointe scored twice for the Islanders. Jan Hlavac
scored twice for the Rangers, who fired 38 shots on goal, 17 in the
third period.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders took their first two-goal lead at 10 minutes 25
seconds of the third period while short-handed when Jorgen Jonsson
scored, wristing a high shot over Rangers goalie Mike Richter after
a pass from Niklas Andersson to put the Islanders up 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   The play began up ice when Zdeno Chara, the big Islanders
defenseman, forced the puck off the stick of Theo Fleury, the
smaller right wing of the Rangers. Their individual battle had been
a significant subplot to an interesting match in a building filled
with loud and excited fans.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive in goal for the Islanders was Kevin Weekes, who
seemed nervous early but got sharper as the evening progressed. He
made 36 saves, 17 in the third period, when the Rangers dominated.
</P>
<P>
   The game was a sellout, rare for this building, where current
ownership has slashed payroll while making little attempt to
assemble a team that can compete at the major-league level. Coming
into the game, the Islanders' record of 7-19-5 gave them 19 points,
tied with the expansion Atlanta Thrashers for worst in the 28-team
league.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first game against the Islanders for Rich Pilon, the
Rangers defenseman who moved from Long Island to Manhattan on Dec.
1 in a waiver deal. Pilon, in his 12th season, was honored by a
video presentation on the scoreboard in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got some great young guys and they're going to be
great hockey players,'' Pilon said of the Islanders. When someone
asked about the lack of veteran leadership in the Islanders locker
room, Pilon responded:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my problem. It's the Islanders' problem. I've got
friends over there. They want to win. It puts a lot of pressure on
a couple of guys who shouldn't have that pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the lineup for the Rangers was Valery Kamensky, a right
wing who had played in only nine games this season because of
problems with his right arm. It was his first game since Nov. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Playing goal for the first time as an Islander was Weekes, who
was obtained on Sunday in a multiplayer trade with Vancouver that
sent goalie Felix Potvin to the Canucks. Weekes played twice
against the Rangers earlier this season and won both times.
</P>
<P>
   After two periods, the Islanders held a 3-2 lead. The pace of
play was fast, the action rollicking and rough. The Rangers had the
edge in goaltending over the first 40 minutes, as the Islanders had
better scoring chances. Weekes looked uncertain on several shots,
and Hlavac's second goal came on a strange carom, on a power play.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-6-inch Fleury bothered the 6-9 Chara the way a mouse
might torment an elephant. When the NHL's tallest and shortest
players bumped for the fifth or sixth time, late in the second
period, Chara knocked Fleury down with a clean check. Fleury
responded with a two-handed slash.
</P>
<P>
   He got a minor penalty for it and Chara remained on the ice,
kneeling as if in pain. Fleury, apparently suspecting that Chara
was milking the moment, charged toward him, shouting, and had to be
restrained. When he took his seat on the penalty bench, Fleury
threw his gloves against the glass.
</P>
<P>
   The best hit of the period _ and one of the best of the season _
was a hip check thrown by Jamie Rivers of the Islanders against
Eric Lacroix of the Rangers, which flipped him up and over and down
on the ice. An interference penalty was called against Rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Lapointe's two goals both took advantage of turnovers at the
blue line by Kim Johnsson of the Rangers. Lapointe scored his first
on a backhand, the second with a forehand.

AFTER 28 YEARS, MAN REPAYS KINDNESS THAT GOT HIM STARTED AS SECRET
SANTA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DONNA McGUIRE  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Sixty-nine-year-old Jerry Brooks sauntered
through a Kansas City thrift store Thursday seeking warm clothing
for less than 75 cents, which was all the money in his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Secret Santa struck.
</P>
<P>
   Dashing through the aisle in a red flannel shirt, Santa pushed a
crisp hundred-dollar bill into Brooks' hand, wished him ``Merry
Christmas,'' and disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks' mouth fell open. He planned to pay 45 cents for a winter
scarf. Now he could get a heavy coat, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well!'' he exclaimed. ``I don't even know that man. He gave me
$100. God. I can't believe that. Lor-r-r-d have mercy. I don't know
where he came from, but if he doesn't live to be 500, I'll eat my
hat.''
</P>
<P>
   The glow on Secret Santa's face was even brighter, for numerous
reasons. He's celebrating his 20th anniversary of helping others
anonymously. He's giving away more than normal: a whopping $85,000,
including some special gifts planned today.
</P>
<P>
   And this week, before spreading Ben Franklin's face around
Kansas City, Secret Santa repaid a gentleman who rescued Santa from
a dire situation nearly three decades ago. And he repaid him with
more interest than even Uncle Sam charges.
</P>
<P>
   That story begins in 1971 in Houston, Miss., a small county
seat.
</P>
<P>
   The man-who-would-become-Santa was a young salesman then. Every
week, his employer sent him a paycheck, paid rent on a small office
and paid for Young Santa to stay at a local motel. One day, the
employer went out of business but neglected to tell Young Santa.
</P>
<P>
   After losing his motel room for nonpayment, Santa slept in the
car eight nights. He kept waiting for a paycheck that never
arrived. Out of gas and money, Santa turned to a local church for
assistance. But the person who oversaw a fund to help poor people
was gone the day he inquired.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Santa walked into the Dixie Diner, a small
brick cafe around the corner from Walgreens. Having not eaten for
nearly two days, he ordered a huge breakfast, slowly sipped coffee
refills and planned how he could escape without paying. Finally, he
feigned losing his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   The owner _ who was the cook, the waiter and the cashier _
lifted a counter top door, walked behind Young Santa's
leather-covered stool, reached toward the floor and acted as if he
had picked up something.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must have dropped this,'' the owner said, handing the
young man $20. Santa's heart was pounding as he paid, left a tip,
raced outside and pushed his car to a gas station before fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   As he drove away, Young Santa thought about how fortunate he
was. Suddenly, it occurred to him that no one had dropped that
money. ``Cookie'' behind the counter knew he was in trouble and
helped in a way that allowed him to keep his dignity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm ever in a position to help other people,'' Santa told
himself, ``that's what I'm going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, Santa rode a Greyhound bus to Kansas City,
where he found a sales job and continued living from paycheck to
paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   One cold day shortly before Christmas 1979, he pulled up to a
little drive-in restaurant in Independence. The carhop looked so
cold and miserable, Santa decided to give her the change from $20.
Her face glowed.
</P>
<P>
   Santa smiled. He went to his bank and withdrew more money. He
didn't have a lot to give then, but his spree had begun.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Santa, who has become a successful Jackson County
businessman, hands out $50,000 or more during each of his Christmas
campaigns. In Santa's own words, he has become a man ``who gets his
thrills by filling people's pockets with hundred-dollar bills.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's never forgotten the person who got him started.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Santa asked a friend to help locate the Mississippi
diner owner. After learning the man's name, Santa debated a whole
year whether to call _ and how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Retired diner owner Ted Horn baked some cakes last weekend in
anticipation of receiving visitors from Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   A Missouri gentleman had called about research he was doing on
Chickasaw County, Miss., where Horn ran a 28-seat diner for two
decades. Today, Horn still awakes at 3:30 a.m., the time he used to
rise to open his Houston-based diner by 4:30 a.m. Now 81, Horn
lives in a modest blond brick ranch home 35 miles to the north in
Tupelo, the birthplace of Elvis Presley.
</P>
<P>
   Horn was sitting in his living room with his two children and
his wife when the ``researcher'' walked in Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Horn held in his lap a magazine article about Kansas City's
Secret Santa. The article mentioned Santa receiving help in a
Houston diner. Horn knew it had been his diner.
</P>
<P>
   The researcher took a deep breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm that guy who was there 28 years ago,'' he announced.
</P>
<P>
   Horn, who had hoped to meet Secret Santa some day, smiled. He
just had.
</P>
<P>
   They talked about the diner, about Houston, about how Horn also
used to run a food truck and offered food to people too poor to
pay.
</P>
<P>
   Santa pulled two books, a Royals cap and Chiefs cap out of his
gift bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you reckon that twenty-dollar bill is worth today?''
he then asked. ``Do you know how to figure net present value? I had
somebody figure that for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Santa could tell Horn the answer (roughly $120), Horn
gave a response that fit right into Santa's plans: ``To me, that
$20 bill then was probably like $10,000 to you today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Funny you should say that number,'' Santa said as he pulled
out an envelope thick with $100 bills. ``See what's in that
envelope.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's not that much money,'' Horn said. ``You don't owe
me nothing!''
</P>
<P>
   The cash was wrapped by a strip of paper that said, ``$10,000.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good God,'' Horn whispered.
</P>
<P>
   To save Horn from gift taxes, which kick in at $10,000, Santa
pulled out one bill and gave it to Horn's wife, Ruby. That left
Horn with $9,900.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't have to do this,'' Horn said softly.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I wanted to,'' Santa replied, smiling. ``You never know
what one little act of kindness will do for somebody. It can change
their whole life, and it changed mine. When I got out on the road
after getting gas, I figured out what you did....''
</P>
<P>
   Santa's voice broke, and he stopped talking for a moment. The
emotion he had tried to hide was bubbling to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it hadn't been for you,'' Santa eventually continued, ``I
might have ended up in some jailhouse somewhere, because a hungry
man sometimes will do desperate things.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching in the living room, Horn's children grew glassy eyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe this,'' David Horn said. ``For this man to
come down and do this for my father _ it's almost more than we can
bear.''
</P>
<P>
   Santa offered to take Horn in his red sleigh (a rented Ford
Explorer) for a quick trip to Houston. The diner was right were
Santa remembered. Though a battered neon sign still says ``Dixie
Diner,'' food no longer is served. Instead, patrons receive
haircuts for $5.
</P>
<P>
   They ate lunch at Moore's Restaurant across town, then Santa
began giving out cash. The waitresses and cooks at the restaurant
screamed in joy first. Then Santa visited a laundry, a Sonic and,
finally, the barber working inside the old diner.
</P>
<P>
   Horn watched in amazement.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Ruby, has battled cancer, a broken hip and a broken
leg. Now she has Alzheimer's disease. Horn, who will care for her
as long as he can, plans to save the Santa's gift for the day she
must enter a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no nursing home insurance,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Kansas City on Thursday, Santa headed out with wads of
$100 in his pockets. His first stop: Nick and Betty's Cafe on
Stadium Drive.
</P>
<P>
   After 40 years, Nick and Betty Nichols were cooking their last
meals and closing for retirement. A new owner will reopen in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Santa had to stop in. After all, Nick used to let him run a tab
at his cafe in 1971, when Santa was a poor salesman. He gave money
to the customers, employees and the Nichols' children, who were
there to savor the cafe's last day.
</P>
<P>
   Waitress Kim Hoy cried when Santa provided $100. Then Santa gave
her two more bills, one for each of her children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't handle this,'' Hoy said between sobs. ``This is the
first Christmas without my mom. I wasn't looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Santa then searched Kansas City streets for other needy people.
He found them standing by an old pickup truck, waiting at bus
stops, walking on a sidewalk, sitting in grocery store parking
lots, buying gas and shopping in that thrift store.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Birdsong, a homeless woman, nearly fainted when Santa gave
her $300 on a Truman Road sidewalk. Her fiance, Cecil Jones,
clutched her around the waist to keep her from falling down. He
also received $300.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm not staying in a (vacant) house tonight,'' Birdsong
said. ``I want to get an apartment.''
</P>
<P>
   Two men promised to forward Santa's gift to their church.
</P>
<P>
   Most planned to use their newfound money for Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``God bless you!'' retired electrician Ivan Mullen, 71, yelled
after Santa outside Thriftway on Truman Road. Mullen had just
purchased $10 in groceries and needed the money to pay for siding
and porch work on his house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you,'' he said in a shaky voice, ``there really is a
God in this world.''
