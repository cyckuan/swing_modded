<HEADLINE> UK to Take Measures to Curb Teenage Pregnancies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The British government is drawing
up plans to curb teenage pregnancies in an attempt to prevent
young girls being trapped by early pregnancy into long-term
dependency on benefits, said local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
One of a number of proposals introduced by Social Security
Minister Frank Field is to urge young single mothers to talk their
experience in schools.
</P>
<P>
Another plan is to use school tests to pinpoint academic
underachievers, the girls believed to be most at risk.
</P>
<P>
These plans were welcomed by family planners, saying this is a
great program and they do a wonderful job.
</P>
<P>
However, they also warned that they do not see this as a
deterrent in itself and said that the project needs to be
accommodated into a wider sex education program, which would
increase sex education in the classroom, involve parents, and make
health services more accessible to young people.
</P>
<P>
They also stressed the need to educate young men as well,
saying that plans should not place the emphasis entirely on young
women as pregnancy does involve both.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that under-age pregnancy in Britain rose by 4
percent in 1994-1995, when there were around 36,329 unmarried
teenage mothers, 12,803 aged 16 or under.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets US Presidential Assistant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIDAIHE, Hebei, August 12 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin,
meeting today with Samuel R. Berger, assistant to the US President
for National Security Affairs, described the general atmosphere of
Sino-US relations as good.
</P>
<P>
"Since my meeting with President Clinton in Manila last
November, relations between the two countries have had positive
progress, with common ground in many fields," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"This situation is the result of joint efforts made by the two
sides. It has been painstakingly achieved and should be
treasured," he said.
</P>
<P>
About his visit to the US this fall, Jiang said: "I expect to
discuss significant issues about developing Sino-US relations with
President Clinton and join hands with him to bring a long-term,
stable and healthy relationship of co-operation to the 21st
century."
</P>
<P>
He said that because China and the US have different social
systems, ideologies, cultural traditions, historical backgrounds,
and levels of development and because they are both large
countries with different principles in handling things, it is
natural that there are disagreements between the two.
</P>
<P>
In properly dealing with these disagreements, he said, the
first thing is to deepen mutual understanding. In doing so,
direct, face-to-face dialogues and exchanges between the two
countries' leaders are especially important. These contacts cannot
be replaced by any other modern means of communication.
</P>
<P>
Discussing Sino-US relations, Jiang emphasized the importance
of the two sides sticking to the principles of mutual respect,
non-interference in each other's internal affairs, and equality in
consultations.
</P>
<P>
"We should ascend the heights and be farsighted, and proceed
from a strategic level in mastering the general situation of
relations between the two countries," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We should strive to expand common ground, enhance trust,
diminish differences, and join hands to create the future," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Berger said that President Clinton is looking forward to
Jiang's visit and that he hopes it will be a new starting point
for relations between the two countries and a milestone for
friendly co-operative relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that the US side is ready to work with the Chinese side
to get prepared for Jiang's visit, so as to ensure its success.

<HEADLINE> China Becomes Largest PC Market in Asia-Pacific Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- China has overtaken South Korea
to become the largest market for personal computers (PC) in the
Asia-Pacific region in the last six months, Financial Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Citing a report by market analyst Dataquest, the newspaper said
that almost 1 million computers were sold in China in the first
half of 1997, roughly a quarter of the total 4 million sold in the
region.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Chinese sales grew by 41 percent on last
year, compared with only 15 percent for the Asia-Pacific PC market
as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the growth of China's PC market was
underpinned by a low penetration rate and vast market potential,
which contrasted sharply with the rapid maturity of some of the
region's major markets that has resulted in declining demand.
</P>
<P>
Figures show that China's demand for PCs has been increasing at
an average annual rate of 40 percent in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chinese domestic branded PCs expanded their domestic
market share to 27 percent in 1996 from 15 percent the year before
and are expected to take a large share of the market this year.

<HEADLINE> China Achieves Healthiest Economy Since 1990s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A new cycle of economic growth
is beginning as China's economy enters its healthiest period since
the 1990s, the State Planning Commission announced today.
</P>
<P>
Fast economic growth and low retail prices have become the
hallmark of an economic upswing, with 9.5 percent growth in the
first half this year -- one of the fastest growth rates in the
world during that period.
</P>
<P>
Retail prices rose a mere 0.6 percent in July on a year-on-year
basis, the lowest inflation rate since the end of the 1980s. Qiu
Xiaohua, chief economist of the State Statistics Bureau, says that
China's current economic situation of "high growth and low
inflation" has been generally recognized as the best situation an
economy can be in. It is actually a "decades-long dream of the
country's decision-makers and economists," he said.
</P>
<P>
This follows the soft landing in the second half of 1996, a
result of successful macro-economic controls by the Central
Government in mid-1993, which curbed excessive speculation, a
leading factor of an over-heated economy.
</P>
<P>
The latest economic growth cycle, which began about seven years
ago, is the only one in the history of the People's Republic of
China which has made a soft landing with high GDP growth, said Liu
Shucheng and Li Jingwen, research fellows at the Chinese Academy
of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The smooth landing reflects the ability of the third-generation
of the Communist Party leaders in handling the socialist market
economy, the two researchers said.

<HEADLINE> China Achieves Healthiest Economy Since 1990s (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In contrast to the last decade's economic controls with
numerous administrative decrees and planning methods, the last
economic control drive used a wide range of economic means.
</P>
<P>
With an appropriately tight financial policy, China streamlined
its money supply through a country-wide reform, ushering in a new
economic model that adjusts the money and resource supply by
controlling interest and exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
This method had played a key role in China's anti-inflation
moves over the past few years, and the Chinese government
stabilized prices by increasing input in agriculture, which helped
reap good harvests and calmed the irrational market demand driven
by the fear of shortages.
</P>
<P>
The central government also developed preferential policies to
encourage investment in the western parts of China to establish a
geographically balanced economy free of supply
fluctuations. Increased investment in the western provinces helped
close the gap between interior areas and coastal regions.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the maturity of the controls, the country's spending,
investment, and exports, the three major forces driving the
country's economy, are now on a sound footing, said Xu Hongyuan,
associate research fellow of the State Information Center.
</P>
<P>
A recent study by CASS and SSB says that China will have GDP
growth of 10 percent this year, while increasing investment in
fixed assets by 12.7 percent and reducing the inflation rate to
four percent or lower,
</P>
<P>
Xu said that the economic boom will be useful for solving
micro-economic problems, such as the low-efficiency in the
state-owned sector and unbalanced industrial structure.
</P>
<P>
The 15th national congress of the CPC, which will open this
fall and which is expected to outline a new strategy of economic
development, will promote reforms in the state-owned enterprise
and exert good influence on all levels of the national economy,
he said.
</P>
<P>
As long as the central government can maintain a "moderately
tight" fiscal policy with increased flexibility in policy, China
will extend the present economic growth to the next century, thus
guaranteeing lasting socioeconomic development, Xu said.

<HEADLINE> Former Irish PM Reynolds to Seek Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Former Irish Prime Minister
Albert Reynolds has indicated that he would contend as a candidate
in the presidential election due to be held later his year,
according to reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Ireland's current President Mary Robinson, who has been named
as the U.N. human rights commissioner, announced early this year
that she would not seek another term of the presidency when it
expires later this year.
</P>
<P>
Reynolds, who had been the country's prime minister from 1992
to 1994, was quoted as saying today, "What other people do is
their business. My name was there, maybe unconfirmed, for the last
two months."
</P>
<P>
Reynolds confirmed that he had written to all members of his
parliamentary party at the weekend, saying he would be seeking the
Fianna Fail nomination.
</P>
<P>
"The people have made it very clear that they want to have say
in who the next president is going to be. They are entitled to
that, and I'm quite happy with that," he said.
</P>
<P>
Reynolds noted that he wanted to become president primarily
because he believed he could "do a good job" and he also rejected
the suggestions that he could not be as neutral on Northern
Ireland as Mary Robinson had been.
</P>
<P>
"I would not say that I don't feel neutral. I'm trying to right
injustices and wrong and look for a fair deal for everybody.
That's my view," he said.

<HEADLINE> British Army to Severely Punish Troublemakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The British army has promised to
crack down on those troublesome armymen following a series of
violent incidents involving its troops.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that five British soldiers have been charged
with attacking holidaymakers in Cyprus this month while drunken
off-duty troops smashed up hotel rooms in the Uruguayan capital
Montevideo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a BBC radio interview this afternoon, Major-General
Mike Wilcox, assistant chief of the general staff, said, "It
doesn't matter at all where or when these incidents occur. We in
the army find them totally unacceptable. We totally condemn this
sort of behavior."
</P>
<P>
"The army takes any allegation or any incident extremely
seriously. We always investigate them thoroughly and then we
severely punish the culprits when they're proven guilty," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he denied that overall discipline levels were falling.
"Nothing's wrong with the army. These are isolated incidents," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"They're not symptomatic of wider disciplinary problems. You
will always get one or two isolated incidents by individuals,
usually where alcohol is concerned," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A total of 62 foreign navy
ships from about 20 countries worldwide had visited South Africa
since the new democratically elected government came into office
in 1994, Defence Minister Joe Modise said today.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question by Farouk Cassim, a parliamentarian
from the Inkatha Freedom Party, Modise told the National Assembly
that the naval base at Simon's Town had once again become an
important and widely used facility for international warships,
and 47 of the visiting navy ships had called at the base.
</P>
<P>
Modise said it was anticipated that use of the base at Simon's
Town for rest and recuperation, as well as for its repair
facilities, would increase as more military agreements with other
countries were signed and ratified.
</P>
<P>
These navy ships are from Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Denmark,
France, India, Italy, Kenya, Malaysia, Mauritius, Netherlands,
Pakistan, Poland, Russia, Singapore, Spain, United Kingdom,
Uruguay and the United States of America, said the Minister.

NEW YORK, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Indiana Pacers with a new
coach Larry Bird, broght Chris Mullin, five time NBA All-Star
forward, onto the club.
</P>
<P>
The Pacers obtained 1992 Olympic "Dream Team" mate Mullin from
the Golden State Tuesday in exchange for center Erick Dampier and
forward Duane Ferrell.
</P>
<P>
Mullin, 34, had played his entire 12-year NBA career with the
Warriors but was the subject of numerous trade rumors over the
past several years. He is in the final season of a nine-year
contract with a rebuilding club.
</P>
<P>
After missing an average of 35 games per season over a
four-year span, Mullin played 79 games last year and averaged 14.5
points and 4.1 assists. He averaged more than 25 points a game
from the 1988-89 to 1992-93 seasons.
</P>
<P>
The deal gives Indiana the league's most potent outside
shooting combination with Mullin, 1996 Olympic "Dream Team III"
guard Reggie Miller and rookie Austin Croshere.

At the welcoming ceremony at the airport, Dlamini said the

It was important for Swaziland and Malawi to strengthen

BEIDAIHE, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen, meeting today with Samuel Berger, assistant
to the U.S. President for National Security Affairs, said that
President Jiang Zemin's upcoming visit to the US in the fall will
symbolize the beginning of a new development stage in Sino-US
relations.
</P>
<P>
It will also signify the restoration of high level dialogues
between the two countries in their capitals, he said, and that
Berger is visiting China at a moment of great importance to the
bilateral ties and hopes that this will help with preparations for
Jiang's visit.
</P>
<P>
Qian said he discussed the preparatory work with Secretary of
State Albright during their recent meeting in Kuala Lumpur, and
both sides are busy with their preparations for Jiang's US trip.
</P>
<P>
The question of Taiwan remains as the most important and most
sensitive issue in Sino-US relations, Qian stressed, and said that
history has shown repeatedly that Sino-US relations can stop or
even suffer great set-backs when troubles over the Taiwan issue
arise.
</P>
<P>
China has taken note of the US government's reaffirmation of
the "one China" policy, and abiding by the three Sino-US joint
communiques, Qian said, expressing hope that the US will continue
to honor these commitments.
</P>
<P>
Berger expressed his pleasure with his China visit which is for
making preparations for Jiang's visit, and said both sides have
made a great effort to build a solid foundation for bilateral
ties. The renewal of China's most-favored nation trading status
has helped create a sound environment for Jiang's tour, he added.
</P>
<P>
Both the US and China place great importance on Jiang's visit
to the US, and in addition to its symbolic significance, it should
have certain practical results, Berger said, and the US side is
willing to work together with China toward this end.
</P>
<P>
The US policy towards China is based on the three Sino-US joint
communiques, and the US will continue to pursue the "one China"
policy, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Afghanistan Needs 170,000 Tons of Emergency Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan will need 170,000
tons of emergency food aid for about 1.75 million people in coming
months, despite the expected largest harvest in 18 years of war.
</P>
<P>
The need was announced today by the World Food Program (WFP).
</P>
<P>
The aid, including 150,000 tons of cereals, will be distributed
to the most vulnerable Afghan people including displaced persons,
returned refugees, female-headed households, and sick and old
people.
</P>
<P>
The WFP is expected to supply 140,000 tons food aid while
non-governmental organizations provide the rest.
</P>
<P>
The provision of aid is aimed at increasing the
self-sufficiency of the Afghan people, a press release issued by
the WFP said.
</P>
<P>
The WFP and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
estimated the cereal production in Afghanistan this year would be
3.66 million tons, comprising 2.71 million tons of wheat, 0.4
million tons of rice, 0.3 million tons of maize and 0.25 million
tons of barley.
</P>
<P>
This would be 18 percent higher than the 1996 harvest of 3.10
million tons and the largest harvest since the outbreak of
hostilities in 1978.
</P>
<P>
The press release said improved security in southern
Afghanistan, sufficient rains and relatively little pest damage
favored agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
But fighting in the north could disrupt harvesting, it added.
</P>
<P>
"The eight northern provinces are forecast to produce 1.3
million tons of cereals, but if the intensity of military
activities increases or the conflict widens over the next few
months, harvesting could be interrupted, and a reduction from this
forecast is possible," the report said.

It begins August 23 and announces about 260

improve its art.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's culture authorities began their reform in 1992 and
many people have been given posts through intense competition, and

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets With US Presidential Assistant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIDAIHE, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng, meeting here
today with Samuel Berger, assistant to the U.S. President for
National Security Affairs, said that the healthy advancement of
Sino-US relations is good for both sides and has a far-reaching
influence on world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the Chinese government is placing great importance
on President Jiang Zemin's state visit to the US this fall, and
that it has great significance for Sino-US relations in the 21st
century, but also benefits global and regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
It is reasonable to believe that China will maintain long-term
political stability and growth in its economy under the leadership
of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee with Jiang
Zemin at its core, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng told the US guests that China will progress along the
road of socialism with Chinese characteristics by the late leader
Deng Xiaoping, and that this historical process is irreversible.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that some people, including some in the United
States, are still spreading the so-called China threat. "It is
groundless," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Although China has achieved rapid economic development, it is
still a developing country with a population of 1.2 billion, Li
noted, adding that it needs at least another 30 years to turn
itself into a moderately developed country.
</P>
<P>
To develop the economy is China's main task, Li said, and China
adheres to an independent foreign policy of peace, and advocates
good-neighborliness and poses no threat to anybody else.
</P>
<P>
Li said that Sino-US relations are the ones between the largest
developed country and the largest and the most dynamic developing
country in the world.
</P>
<P>
Berger said he's pleased to have been entrusted by President
Clinton to visit China to prepare for President Jiang Zemin's
visit to the United States, and that the US highly values Jiang's
visit, which has great significance and a far-reaching influence.
</P>
<P>
Berger noted that co-operation in environmental protection and
energy are the two important co-operative areas of the two sides,
which complement each other.
</P>
<P>
The two sides established a sound foundation for co-operation
when Vice-President Al Gore visited China this March, Berger said,
and he believes that Jiang's visit will help promote this
co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Berger emphasized that the US government disagrees with "China
Threat" theory. Instead, it holds that a strong, not a weak China
will be more beneficial to the world.
</P>
<P>
He said the US supports China's access to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) and is willing to make efforts toward this
end.

SEOUL, August 12 (Xinhua) -- South Korea spent 8.03 billion
U.S. dollars on pollution abatement and control efforts in 1996, a
13.8 percent increase from a year ago, a preliminary tally by the
Bank of Korea (BOK) showed today.
</P>
<P>
The figure represented 1.84 percent of the nation's gross
domestic product (GDP), compared with 1.75 percent in 1994 and
1.79 percent in 1995, the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
It is the third time that South Korea has produced specific
data on government and private-sector pollution abatement and
control (PAC) expenditures to meet the obligations as a member of
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and
also of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The government sector spent 3.74 billion U.S. dollars, or 46.6
percent of all pollution-prevention expenses last year, and the
business and household sectors spent 4.29 billion U.S. dollars, or
53.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Water pollution control-related expenditures amounted to 3.98
billion U.S, dollars, compared with 2.51 billion U.S. dollars for
waste materials and 1.16 billion U.S. dollars for air pollution,
the central bank said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Deploys Troops in Bekaa Valley to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese troops backed by tanks
and armored personnel carriers today finished its deployment in
the country's east Bekaa Valley as an attempt to stop revolt and
civil disobedience there.
</P>
<P>
The move came in line with last week's decision of the
Central Security Council to ensure law and order in the Bekaa
area.
</P>
<P>
Over the past weeks, former secretary general of Hezbollah,
or Party of God, Sheikh Sobhi Tufaili, and his leftist political
allies, had publicly urged residents of the Bekaa Valley to
stage a "hunger revolt" and refuse to pay taxes and utility fees
to the government until it takes steps to improve living
conditions in the region.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports said that the deployment will initially
be confined to patrols that will roam the area, check motorists
and arrest law-breakers.
</P>
<P>
The exact number of troops and police deployed in the area is
not officially announced, but media reports put it at 500 to
1,000, including 150 policemen.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that the security patrols will also be in
charge of carring out arrest warrants against criminals in what
has long been a region off limits to police because of the strong
presence of the militant Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's Attorney General Adnan Addoum told the daily An
Nahar today that prosecutors had already started preparing arrest
warrants based on "factual information" such as pictures,
video-tapes, text of speeches by those who are suspected of
inciting revolt, civil disobedience and encouragement to break
the law, such as building houses on public and private property
without license.
</P>
<P>
Parallel with its security measures, the government took the
move Monday in the direction of studying development projects
in impoverished rural areas, including the Bekaa Valley.
</P>
<P>
A total of 97 million U.S. dollars has been allocated to these
areas, and will be used in irrigation, drinking water and road
projects as well as projects for land reclamation and health
care.
</P>
<P>
the Iranian-backed Hezbollah has led the campaign to drive
Israeli forces out of southern Lebanon. Israel maintains a
so-called "security zone" in south Lebanon to protect against
cross-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> Greek, Yugoslav Foreign Ministers Meet in Athens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos today held talks with his visiting Yugoslav counterpart,
Milan Milutinovic, on developments in the Balkans, cooperation and
promotion of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after their talks, Pangalos hailed his
talks with Milutinovic as "excellent," saying that the ministers
of the two countries would exchange visits and meetings would be
held between their military leaders.
</P>
<P>
Greece also pledged to facilitate the movement of Yugoslav
citizens to Greece by establishing a consular office in Nis and
the opening of credits totaling 100 million U.S. dollars for the
promotion of Greek investments in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Athens and Belgrade today also voiced their opposition to any
attempt to revise the Dayton peace accord on Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"We support the Dayton agreement as it stands and all three
sides in Bosnia were responsible for its implementation,"
Milutinovic said, adding that it was wrong to attribute
responsibility to only one side.
</P>
<P>
Greece supports Belgrade's speedy return to international
organizations, with Pangalos saying that Athens was in favor of
Yugoslavia's immediate incorporation in international life and
international organizations and the immediate re-examination of
the neighboring country's European perspective.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav foreign minister also extended an invitation today
to Greece's Prime Minister Costas Simitis for his visit to
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic arrived here Monday for a two-day official visit to
Greece.

LUANDA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Angola's Deputy Chief Justice
Maria Medina today urged the establishment of women procuratorate
in the country to protect women from violence.
</P>
<P>
She made the statement at a national conference on violence on
women, which was unveiled today.
</P>
<P>
According to Medina, violence on women is a serious problem in
Angola. Its many bad consequences had disturbed social and family
relations.
</P>
<P>
She attributed the cause of the violence on women to sexual
harassment and early marriages.
</P>
<P>
Lena Sundh, Swedish Ambassador to Angola said in her speech
that violence on women is a kind of crime which is in violation
of human rights. It also set obstacles to national economy and
peace, she added.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference has drawn government officials, lawers,
religious people to discuss the issue of violence on Angolan
women.

<HEADLINE> Greek Troops to Remain in Albania to Help Train </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A company of Greek troops
participating in the Italian-led multinational force in Albania
will remain in the neighboring country to help reorganize and
train Tirana's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The move came following a request made by Albania's Defense
Minister Sabit Brokaj, a Greek National Defense General Staff
announcement said today.
</P>
<P>
The announcement said that the request was within the framework
of a bilateral cooperation protocol signed during Greek Foreign
Minister Theodoros Pangalos' visit to Albania on August 5.
</P>
<P>
The duration of the Greek troops' stay would be determined "in
a subsequent agreement," said the announcement.
</P>
<P>
The remaining Greek troops, whose exact number is not known,
still stay in a military base in Elbasan, 35 kilometers southeast
of Tirana.
</P>
<P>
In April, a total of more than 700 Greek troops arrived in
Albania as part of the multinational force to protect the speedy
distribution of humanitarian aid and the June 29 general elections
in the neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
The largest part of the Greek troops returned home at the
beginning of this month.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bundesbank Throws Uncertainty on Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A decision by the German central
bank today to leave its securities repurchase rate unchanged has
thrown more uncertainty on foreign exchange markets with traders
being puzzled where to invest their money next.
</P>
<P>
But some experts believe that the German central bank, the
Bundesbank, is only delaying an eventually necessary move to
raise the German interest rates to check the mark's steady decline
against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The repurchase rate, applying to short-term liquidity provided
to banks which sell securities and then repurchase them at an
appointed date, has been frozen at 3.0 percent since August 1996.
</P>
<P>
With the dollar powering to an eight-year high against the mark
recently, senior officials at the Bundesbank hinted last week that
they might switch from a fixed repurchase rate to a variable, and
almost certainly higher, rate to try to offer some support to the
mark.
</P>
<P>
Instead of implementing that scenario, the German central
bankers decided today to fix the repurchase rate for another seven
days. By doing so, analysts said, the Bundesbank can still keep
alive speculations about the prospects for higher German interest
rates and thus helping slow the pace of the dollar's advance
against the mark.
</P>
<P>
After a day of nervous trading, the dollar was fixed at 1.8638
marks in Frankfurt today, compared with Monday's 1.8576 marks and
last week's record high of over 1.89 marks.
</P>
<P>
Currency traders said they expected the dollar to be quoted at
between 1.84 marks and 1.87 marks in the next few days. The next
impulse for the markets would be the U.S. inflation data to be
released Wednesday which would lead to changes in U.S. interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said, however, that the Bundesbank may decide to raise
interest rates anyway, for reasons to defend the mark against a
steadily rising dollar, or to signal that it still remains
independent in the run up to the single European currency, the
Euro, which is due to be started on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Widespread worry about a weak Euro has been a major cause of
the continuing weakness of the mark.
</P>
<P>
But it is also widely assumed that a rate increase in Germany
carried the risk that it could choke economic growth and undermine
Bonn's efforts to combat unemployment higher than 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
The weak German mark, which has fallen about 18 percent against
the dollar so far this year, makes imports to Germany more
expensive but helps the export sector that has been so crucial to
Germany's nascent recovery from a five-year economic slump.

<HEADLINE> 97,000 Refugees of Congo (k) Remain in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Ninety-seven thousand
refugees from the Democartic Republic of Congo remain in Tanzania
pending for repatriation.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Tanzanian Defense and National Service
Minister Edgar Maokola Majogo at the current session of the
National Assembly in Dodoma today.
</P>
<P>
The refugees, including some soldiers, fled their country
during civil strifes, said Majogo, adding that the situation is
calming down in that central African country with Laurent
kabila's administration.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that during the year 1997/98, the situation
in Tanzania was calm and border areas were peaceful with
exception to those bordering Burundi and the Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
Areas bordering Tanzania and the democratic Congo were tense
due to a big number of Congolese refugees who were fleeing their
country into Tanzania because of civil strifes there, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is working closely with defense mechanism in the
African region, particularly the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) and the East African Community (EAC), to ensure
peace prevailed and in combating different crimes, according to
Majogo.

LONDON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Leading stock markets in Europe
all made sharp contrast with Monday's dull showing and turned
bullish again today, led by London which rose almost 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Britain's major FTSE 100 index shrugged off vague talk that
interest rates may rise again soon and posted a solid 43.9-point
gain to close above 5,050 at 5,075.8.
</P>
<P>
The market took news of a rise in inflation to 3.3 percent in
its stride and took heart from Germany's decision to leave its
repo rates unchanged for now. Share prices were also helped by a
raft of interim company results which were roughly in line with
expectations.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares ended the session at higher levels,
helped by the more stable dollar and a firmer German debt market.
The DAX-30 index closed at 4,363.09, up 29.96 points.
</P>
<P>
On the Paris bourse, firmer trends on other European markets
and firmer bond prices helped share prices move higher, with the
CAC-40 index finishing at 2,998.57, a rise of 15.13 points on the
day.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Government, Rebels Join Forces to Halt AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Warring factions in Sudan
are coming together for the first time to support an effort to
slow the spread of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted
diseases in the southern part of the country, said a report
released by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) today.
</P>
<P>
The national government and the Sudan People's Liberation
Movement are making contributions in cash or in kind for the
preparatory phase of this three-year program, said the report.
</P>
<P>
A total of 309,000 U.S. dollars from the UNDP and other UN
agencies would help finance an assessment of HIV prevalence in the
south, a study of factors that contribute to the epidemic's
spread, and a system for coordinating the initiative, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The Sudan national AIDS program would implement the project in
government areas and the Sudan Rehabilitation and Relief
Association would implement it in zones held by rebels, added the
report.
</P>
<P>
The south accounts for nearly half of the country's AIDS cases.
Studies so far have shown that the large military presence in the
region, along with population displacement, lead to a
higher-than-average incidence of the disease.

<HEADLINE> Russian Defense Ministry on Air Force Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 12 (Xinhua) -- As a result of integration of
the Russian Air Force with air defense troops will reduce the
number of general-held posts from 330 to 130, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to a Defense Ministry spokesman, the integration is
to give rise to single type of troops, the Russian Air Force.
</P>
<P>
He said the military reform, which is to re-make the army of
1,700,000 into a compact 1,200,000, will reduce the present Air
Force personnel 3.18 times, including a 2.9 time decrease in the
number of flyers and a 4.64 time decrease in the sergeant and
private personnel.
</P>
<P>
The ministry press service said that the Air Force personnel
has dwindled from 500,000 in 1991 to the present 170,000 and the
aircraft fleet from 11,000 to 5,000. The number of
aircraft-repairing factories has decreased from 57 to 23.
</P>
<P>
Most of the lay-offs involved managerial personnel and
duplicate services, while combat units remained intact, the press
service said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Air Force is currently made of 21 air divisions and
over 100 regiments.
</P>
<P>
The military reform of the Air force will put the combat
airpower under operational command of military district
commanders, and the long-haul and transport airpower is to remain
under the Air Force commander.
</P>
<P>
According to the press service, the planned integration of
airpowers and air defense troops into the single Air Force would
facilitate the adoption of computer control of airfield and
logistic services, applications of sophisticated space mission
systems and implementation of a program of rearmament with new
hardware and air-to-ground and air-to-air weapons.

<HEADLINE> Belarus Dislikes Barter Deal With Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko has complained about barter deals between Belarus and
Russia, saying it impedes the economic development of the two
countries' union, the Interfax news agency reported from Minsk,
capital of Belarus, today.
</P>
<P>
The Russian gas company Gazprom is "justifiably demanding" that
Belarussian consumers pay for gas supplies, Lukashenko was quoted
by Interfax as saying.
</P>
<P>
Belarus "is paying much more for gas supplies than Russian
enterprises," he added.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko said Russian companies often made settlements with
Belarussian partners "with the use of metals and other products."
"But this cannot be handed out to the budget or be used for paying
wages to the population," he noted.
</P>
<P>
There would be no problems over payments for Russian energy
supplies, if Russia were now solvent with regard to Belarus, the
president said.
</P>
<P>
Barter deals impair economic relations between the two
countries, Lukashenko stressed. "This is the Stone Age rather than
the market economy. It is not even a centralized planning
economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Belarussian president said that on the whole,
the development of Belarussian-Russian relations in the economic
and customs spheres "is influencing the Belarussian economy
favorably."
</P>
<P>
Lukasheko meanwhile noted that positive trends have appeared
in the Belarussian economy.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Stop Oil Export to S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Nigeria government has
ordered its businessman to stop exporting petroleum products to
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
A release of the Petroleum Pipelines Marketing Company said
today that the order is sequel to the economic sanctions against
Sierra Leone by the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS), the Nigeria television authority reported.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS announced full-scale economic embargo and sanctions
against the troubled country shortly after the military junta
said at the end of July that it would stay in power until the
year 2001.
</P>
<P>
The release also dissociated the company from the reported
discharge of petroleum products in Sierra Leone by a vessel
related to it.
</P>
<P>
It stated that an area manager of the company had been
blacklisted by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a British Broadcasting Company report said the fuel
crisis in Sierra Leone led to the death of two men this morning
in the capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
A 25-year-old motor mechanical attached to a gas station in
the east of the capital was shot in the stomach when he was
asking for payment for some five gallons of petrol ordered by a
man in military camouflage and armed with an automatic assault

<HEADLINE> CIS Peacekeepers Stand Neutral in Tajikistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS) peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan strictly adhere to
neutrality and non-interference in the internal affairs of the
sovereign republic, Commander Boris Dyukov said in a statement in
Dushanbe today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, the statement said the
peacekeeping units remain in the places of their permanent
deployment. They neither participated in the past nor are
currently involved in the armed conflict and its elimination.
</P>
<P>
Security has been stepped up at military installations and the
settlements and districts where the families of CIS servicemen
live, Dyukov's statement said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the peacekeeping air units have remained
at the points of their permanent deployment over the last few
days. They conducted exercises in the designated areas of Tajik
air space.
</P>
<P>
Dyukov said peacekeepers will participate in protecting Tajik
military and government sites only after the CIS leadership makes
an official decision to this effect.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, armed clashes between government forces and
renegade units under Col. Makhmud Khudoiberdiyev are taking place
seven kilometers north of Kurgan-Tyube, a source in the military
was quoted by Interfax as saying.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Liberian refugees in neighboring
Guinea are eager to go home as Guinea is moving to re-establish
its official relations with Liberia.
</P>
<P>
A Nigeria Television Authority report tonight said although
the refugees, estimated at 400,000, did not participated in
Liberia's elections in July, they said they were satisfied with
the outcome.
</P>
<P>
To them, the election has brought peace to the country after
seven years of bitter civil war that forced them to flee.
</P>
<P>
A woman was quoted as saying that though the civil war killed
"our father, mother, brothers and sisters, though Mr. Charles
Taylor decided the revolution in Liberia or brought disasters to
the country, we should say he has won the election which means
total peace".
</P>
<P>
"As Liberians, it is our responsibility to embrace peace in
our country", she added.
</P>
<P>
All the refugees were looking forward to being back to the
country to rebuild their life, said the report.
</P>
<P>
the report did not say what move Guinea has taken to improve
its relations with Liberia.
</P>
<P>
It however warned the two countries should pay more attention
to their common borders which were sort of concern for both
during Liberia's civil war.

<HEADLINE> US Productivity Growth Slows in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Growth of U.S. non-farm
productivity slowed sharply during the second quarter, the U.S.
Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that U.S. non-farm productivity -- output
per hour worked -- grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
0.6 percent in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
The growth was less than half the revised 1.4 percent annual
rate during the first three months of the year and the worst
showing since the third quarter of 1996 when U.S. productivity
declined.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that hours worked rose at a 1.7 percent
annual rate in the quarter, down from 4.2 percent in the previous
three months of the year. Worker compensation per hour rose at a
3.1 percent rate, down from 4.5 percent in the first three months.
</P>
<P>
Labor costs per unit of output -- a key ingredient in pressures
on the prices of goods and services -- grew at a 2.4 percent rate
in the second quarter, down from 3.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The quick productivity gain in the first quarter accompanied a
fast rate of economic growth of 4.9 percent in the country, while
the modest increase in the second quarter accompanied moderate
economic growth of a 2.2 percent annual rate.
</P>
<P>
Economists cite productivity improvements as a key factor
keeping a lid on inflation and the key to how fast U.S. living
standards can rise. It means businesses can raise wages without
increasing their prices because workers are producing more in each
hour of work.
</P>
<P>
U.S. productivity gains exceeded 3 percent a year in the 1960s
and it supported the economic boom at that time. But productivity
has averaged only about 1 percent a year since the early 1970s.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls Welfare Reform Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today declared the welfare reform legislation he signed a year ago
successful.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a gathering in St. Louis, Missouri, Clinton urged
private businesses to "make sure there is a job there" for the
millions leaving public assistance rolls for the workplace.
</P>
<P>
The welfare-to-work legislation would force unemployed workers
off welfare rolls in two years' time, ending the nation's longtime
guarantee of coverage for the poor.
</P>
<P>
Saying the law was warranted and working, Clinton announced
that 1.4 million fewer people were on welfare since he signed the
legislation last year, with the rolls down 3.4 million, a record
24 percent, since he took office.
</P>
<P>
He said, "I think it's fair to say the debate is over. We know
now that welfare reform works."
</P>
<P>
Clinton called on corporations in St. Louis and nationwide to
hire welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
Clinton praised the non-profit "Welfare to Work Partnership,"
formed in January to help them use the wage subsidies promised by
last year's sweeping welfare reform law. So far, some 750
companies have joined. Clinton has set a goal of moving 2 million
Americans off the welfare rolls by 2000.

UNITED NATIONS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan will need
170,000 tons of emergency food aid for some 1.75 million people in
coming months, despite its expected largest harvest in 18 years of
civil strife, UN food agencies reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Food and Agricultural Organization and the World Food

Even if the favorable forecast proves true, Afghanistan will
need to import some 710,000 tons of cereals, mainly for an urban
population swollen by the return of refugees, the two agencies
reported.
</P>

<P>
HARARE, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe today called on the defense forces to embark on income
generating activities to improve conditions of service
and the state of the country's defense system.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to over 30,000 Zimbabweans gathered to witness
the celebrations of the Defense Forces Day, Mugabe said the
prevailing peace in Africa has made it possible for the military
forces to do so.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry, which was allocated 490 million U.S. Dollars
in the budget for the coming 18 months, needed more resources to be
able to build its fighting capabilities and military preparedness,
Mugabe noted.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean President hailed the contributions made by
the country's defense forces in UN and Organization of African Unity
(OAU) peacekeeping operations in Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Zimbabwe is proud of the achievements of her defense
forces in carrying out humanitarian operations in Somalia, Rwanda and
Angola under the auspices of the UN and OAU."
</P>
<P>
Mugabe also praised the participation of defense forces in the
preservation of natural resources in collaboration with the
Department of National Parks and Wildlife, provision of rescue
services for flood victims and control of malaria outbreak.
</P>
<P>
The celebrations went on peacefully without interruptions from
disgruntled liberation war veterans as happened during the
commemoration of Heroes' Day Monday.
</P>
<P>
Activities lined up for the day included parades by Zimbabwe
National Army, Air Force of Zimbabwe, the Zimbabwe Republic Police
and the Zimbabwe Prison Service.
</P>
<P>
The crowd was also treated to helicopter displays, gun
drill and a soccer match in the afternoon.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Zambia got 40 million dollars
from cotton textile export last year, according to Financial Mail
today.
</P>
<P>
Germany, the United Kingdom and the Switzerland remained the
major markets accounting for 95.28 percent of the total earnings,
indicating an increase from the last three years when these
markets accounted for about 83 percent of Zambia's textle export
earnings, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA)
only accounted for 1.2 percent of the earnings while the rest of
southern african region accounted for 3.9 percent of the
earnings.
</P>
<P>
Europe remained to be the largest market for Zambia's textile
exports due to the preferential access provided to Zambia and
other African, Caribbean, Pacific Countries under the Lome
Convention.
</P>
<P>
However, the situation is expected to drastically change
negatively after the year 2000 when the Lome Convention expires
as the quotas on textiles from the Far East and Asia will be
removed, thus Zambia will have to compete with exports from the
developed Far East and Asia.
</P>
<P>
Efforts by the local textile industry to break into the South
African Custom Union market have been hampered by the high duty
rates in the cotton textile business.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Calls for Ceasefire in Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 12 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today met his Sudanese counterpart Omar al Bashir,
calling for a ceasefire and peace in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Mandela urged Bashir "to face the reality" that he had to make
peace with Sudan People's Liberation Army Leader John Garang,
who, Mandela said, was conducting "quite a powerful military
struggle".
</P>
<P>
Mandela met Garang in December last year.
</P>
<P>
Referring to earlier reports that Mandela will be asked to act
as mediator, Mandela said " There can be no peace in Sudan unless
the Sudanese themselves sit down to talk peace."
</P>
<P>
"Our role is merely a facilitating one," Mandela noted.
</P>
<P>
Bashir supported Mandela's appeal, saying that a ceasefire was
vital for a climate conducive to peace talks with Garang. He
confirmed that his government had accepted the declaration of
princeiples as a basis for such talks.
</P>
<P>
He said a peace agreement his government signed with six
southern rebel movements in April was comprehensive enough to
meet the aspirations of all the people of southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The agreement provided for the self-determination for southern
Sudan within four years. Refugees and displaced people would also
be resettled over this period.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the war should come to an end, and we have
requested a ceasefire with the faction of Dr. Garang," he added.

<HEADLINE> Canada Expects 4 Percent Growth in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian economy is expected
to grow by 4.0 percent this year, a report by the Bank of Canada
said today.
</P>
<P>
"The bank expects the economy to continue to expand vigorously
-- at an average rate of around 4.0 percent through to the fourth
quarter," the central bank said in its latest economic review.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian economy grew by 3.4 percent in the first quarter
of 1997, which was stimulated by strong domestic demand and a
rebound in exports.
</P>
<P>
The amount of slack in the economy is falling rapidly, said the
review which was released here today.
</P>
<P>
The output gap, indicating there is still room for
non-inflationary growth and increased employment in the economy,
fell to 2.25 percent during the first quarter from 3.0 percent
at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The bank predicted that Canada's inflation would remain at the
low end of its target range of 1.0 percent to 3.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
It said that interest rates were expected to rise gradually in
the next few years.
</P>
<P>
"As economic slack is absorbed, the bank will need to promote
less stimulative monetary conditions to support a durable
expansion and preserve Canada's low inflation rate," it added.

<HEADLINE> US Retail Sales Up 0.6 Percent in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Retail sales in the U.S.
increased by 0.6 percent in July, the second straight advance, the
U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that it was the fresh evidence that consumer
spending in the U.S. rebounded strongly from a second-quarter
pause.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said that retail sales totaled a
seasonally adjusted 212.1 billion dollars in July, up from a
revised 210.7 billion in June when the sales rose by 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The gain in June followed three straight declines that
interrupted a spending spree that propelled the economy to a 4.9
percent annual growth rate during the first quarter of this year.
The U.S. economy grew at just a 2.2 percent rate in the following
three months.
</P>
<P>
Sales of durable goods -- items expected to last more than
three years -- rose 0.7 percent in July after an even stronger 1.1
percent jump in June. Sales of automobiles advanced by 1 percent
on top of a 1.4 percent gain a month earlier. Excluding the auto
component, sales still were up by 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sales of nondurable goods such as food and fuel increased 0.6
percent following a 0.4 percent gain in June.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales account for about one-third of the U.S. economic
activity.
</P>
<P>
Many local analysts have noted signs of resurgent growth
recently and they predicted that the U.S. economy may be
accelerating too fast in the second half to keep inflation under
control.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Sends 228-member Delegation to National Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) announced Wednesday that it would
send a 228-member delegation to the China's Eighth National Games
slated for October 12-24 in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time that the National Games include
athletes from the HKSAR which was established on July 1 when China
celebrated Hong Kong's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Timothy Fok, Chief de Mission of the HKSAR delegation for the
Games, told a press conference here that his delegation will
include 168 athletes picked up from an initial list of 433. They
will compete in archery, badminton, canoeing, football, cycling,
tennis, equestrian, judo, swimming and diving, wushu, boxing,
gymnastics, fencing, rowing, shooting, table tennis, handball,
basketball, athletics and field hockey.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulations, only Chinese citizens among the
Hong Kong residents are eligible for the Games. In order not to
block any Chinese citizens from participating in the Games, the
organizers have decided that those among the permanent Hong Kong
residents who have been ratified by the HKSAR government as
Chinese citizens can also go as well.
</P>
<P>
Fok said SAR's participation shows that the concept of "one
county, two systems" is being applied by the Chinese central
government and Chinese sports community.
</P>
<P>
Athletes from the SAR have enjoyed such privileges as skipping
various sports' qualifying tournaments. They should thus make
good use of this opportunity and try to perform well, Fok added.
</P>
<P>
Fok also said HKSAR delegation will do everything it can to
cooperate with the Games' organizing committee in its fight
against illegal drugs. "HKSAR athletes should behave well and keep
away from drugs to keep local sports clean," he said.

<HEADLINE> Fluoride Molecules Found In Interstellar Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 13 (Xinhua) -- A team of astronomers from the
United States and Germany has discovered trace amounts of hydrogen
fluoride gas in the near vacuum of interstellar space, the
European Space Agency said today.
</P>
<P>
Although approximately 100 different kinds of molecules have
been detected in interstellar space over the past 30 years, the
discovery of hydrogen fluoride is the first time that a molecule
containing fluorine has been detected in an interstellar gas
cloud, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
Using the European Space Agency's Infrared Space Observatory
satellite, ISO, which was launched in November 1995, the
astronomers searched for hydrogen fluoride molecules within a
giant cloud of interstellar gas located near the center of the
Milky Way galaxy. The new observations were carried out in March
with the Long Wavelength Spectrometer, one of four instruments on
board ISO.
</P>
<P>
Looking in the far-infrared region of the electromagnetic
spectrum, the astronomers observed the telltale signature of
absorption by trace amounts of hydrogen fluoride gas.
</P>
<P>
The gas cloud in which hydrogen fluoride molecules were
discovered lies approximately 20,000 light years from Earth, in
the Southern constellation, Sagittarius.

<HEADLINE> Human Error Causes Plane Crash in Belgium: Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Preliminary results of an
investigation pointed the July 26 crash of a biplane at Ostend,
Belgium, to human error, local television reported today.
</P>
<P>
The RTBF television quoted aeronautic authorities as
attributing the crash, which killed nine people and injured 57
others, to errors committed by the Jordanian pilot of the Falcon
XT300 plane which is designed to specialize in acrobatic flights.
</P>
<P>
Specialists drew the conclusion after analyzing video
recordings of the lethal flight. They found that the pilot,
Captain Amr Hani Bilal, had only 10 to 15 meters from ground to
pull up the plane, to correct his maneuver after his last number
of a series of loops.
</P>
<P>
German designers and manufacturers of the Falcon planes are
examining the debris of the crashed plane which was collected and
sent to a nearby Belgian town for investigation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports quoted Interior Minister Vande Lanotte as
saying that the pilot seemed to have lost control over the plane
while doing the loops which exacted great gravity pressure on the
pilot.
</P>
<P>
The plane spun out of control before crashing onto a first-aid
tent at the edge of the spectator area, spreading debris and
burning kerosene on to spectators.
</P>
<P>
At one time the plane was flying directly overhead the
spectators, which was not allowed by air-show regulations.
</P>
<P>
A display must be interrupted when a plane crosses the
so-called display line, usually the runway on the airfield, and
flies immediately over the crowd.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Auction Radio Airspace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Canada will use U.S.-style
auctions to sell off certain untapped areas of the country's radio
frequency spectrum, said reports today.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government would begin selling precious airspace
to the highest bidder in mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
The government said that auctions are a quick and efficient
means of awarding spectrum licenses.
</P>
<P>
The first auction in Canada is expected to sell a local
multipoint communication system license next year, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
The radio frequency spectrum is the medium for everything from
satellite communications to garage door-openers and microwave
ovens.
</P>
<P>
So far, the government has allocated spectrum licenses for
communication services.
</P>
<P>
The United States introduced spectrum auctions in 1994 and
raised billions of dollars by selling licenses for wireless
communications to the highest bidders.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the U.S. policy, which forces companies to pay a large
upfront fee for the license, has also created financial problems
for the smaller bidders and at least one high-profile bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government said it plans to learn from the
mistakes of others, and will let companies pay auction fees over a
long period rather than requiring them upfront.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM Raps Rich Countries for Squeezing the Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today accused rich countries of enjoying
"squeezing" poor countries instead of helping them.
</P>
<P>
"What annoyed me is this kind of activities is actually being
supported by very rich countries, and these countries don't even
help poor countries," Mahathir said told reporters when asked to
comment on the current drop in value of the Malaysian currency
ringgit.
</P>
<P>
"When they see poor countries, they try to knock them on their
heads and yet they talk about justice, about democracy -- what
democracy is this when the rich can squeeze the poor," Mahathir
said.
</P>
<P>
The rich countries did not care what they did to other people,
and they thought that destroying the economy of developing
countries was great fun, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir also said that the ringgit's fall was only temporary
and the government was doing its very best towards a "final
solution" to the problem.
</P>
<P>
The ringgit today dropped further to 2.786 against the U.S.
dollar from 2.765 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir remained relentless in his attack on speculative
currency traders who have caused currencies in the region to take
a severe beating in the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
"They can try their best to destroy us. They said no
conspiracy, but whether there is conspiracy or not, the fact
remains that they have done this deliberately knowing that the
ringgit was sliding and they want to bring it down further," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said these people wanted to make money for themselves and
money for the rich.
</P>
<P>
"We want to reduce imports because now imports cost a little
bit more due to the value of the ringgit has come down. Therefore,
for the time being we have to reduce imports," Mahathir said.
These were only temporary measures, he added.

<HEADLINE> Remarkable Progress Achieved in Economic Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials and economists
believe that China has had some remarkable achievements in its
economic restructuring aimed at establishing the socialist market
economic system.
</P>
<P>
These comments came at a State Commission for Restructuring the
Economy symposium in Beijing today, where Zhang Haoruo,
vice-minister in charge of the Commission said that China has had
three major achievements in restructuring the economy.
</P>
<P>
He said they involve a better understanding of ownership, the
share-holding, investment, enterprise and price reforms, and
restructuring the economy.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wule, vice-minister in charge of the State Economic and
Trade Commission said that the reforms of the state enterprises
have made some progress since the convocation of the 14th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China in 1992.
</P>
<P>
China has moved from focusing on each individual enterprise to
the overall state-owned economy, from reducing taxes and charges to
establishing new taxation and profit distribution systems.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jibin, vice-minister of finance, said that in the past five
years, the reform of finance and tax departments also had some
progress, and that a rational system of central and local revenues
has been established, promoting the steady growth of national
revenues.
</P>
<P>
State-owned enterprises' profit distribution has also been
changing to meet the needs of the socialist market economy, and he
believes that a fair competitive system has also been established.
</P>
<P>
Ding Junfa, chief economist with the Ministry of Internal
Trade, said that since 1992, most commodities have been traded
freely with the prices of more than 90 to 95 percent of the
commodities are set free.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- China's Eighth National Games,
to be held on October 12-24 in Shanghai, are of historical
significance as China has just celebrated Hong Kong's return to
the motherland, a top Chinese sports official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters from China's southern provinces and Hong
Kong and Macao at a press conference, Yuan Weimin, vice minister
of the State Physical Culture and Sports Committee, said that
various reforms have been carried out to guarantee that Chinese
athletes could achieve better performance at the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Medal sports set for the National Games have been cut down to
26 Olympic sports and traditional Chinese martial arts wushu. And
provincial delegations will have points added to their standings
total for any Olympic medal won by their athletes before the
National Games, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), for
example, already had points because its star windsurfer Lee
Lai-shan won the first ever Olympic gold medal for Hong Kong at
last year's Atlanta Games, Yuan said.
</P>
<P>
Participating in the Games will be 46 delegations from China's
provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, the People's
Liberation Army and various professions with a total of 7,700
athletes.

<HEADLINE> Somali Banana Farmers Unite for Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Somali farmers in Lower
Shabelle region have declared to have ended their long standing
conflict following a meeting held in Bulo Marer village, 125 km
south of the capital, two days ago.
</P>
<P>
The farmers who mainly grow banana, Somalia's largest
exporting item, have been seriously divided in their devotion to
the two foreign companies, Somali Fruit which is attached to the
Italian company, De Nadai, and Sombana associated with the
American company, Dole.
</P>
<P>
According to the farmers, the meeting has discussed about how
deeply their production was hampered by the unyielding
competition between the two companies. Despite the investments
offered by these two companies to the farmers, the meeting has
acknowledged that some farmers were forced to go out of the
business or made less productive.
</P>
<P>
The meeting has resolved that the farmers should not, from now
on, remain divided into companies or clan-based ideologies which
they classified as dangerous elements to their existence and
production.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Hassan, a farmer, said the competition has even
created animosity among farmers who have lived together all their
life.
</P>
<P>
"Before these companies arrived here we used to lend and
borrow fuel, pesticides and seeds for sowing among ourselves,"
said Hassan.
</P>
<P>
At the end of their meeting, the farmers have established a
11-member committee headed by Salal Mohamed Siyad to prepare a
constitution and a congress for the farmers before the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
The farmers have also announced the formation of a consortium
for the banana producers known as 'Banana Producers Consortium'.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of Banana producers has taken place at a time when
exportation of the fruit dropped to its lowest owing to bad
weather during the southwest monsoon winds which had prevented
the navigation of all vessels less than 3000 tons into the waters
of the wild Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the factions opposing late General Mohamed
Farah Aidid have accused these two companies for not being
neutral in the Somali politics and for financing the late
general. The accusations have led to the closure of Mogadishu's
main seaport in October 1995.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the Malaysian company which has now set up a bank
in south Mogadishu, these two companies have always been the only
two foreign companies that dared to make an investment into
Somalia who is at its worst stage ever in history when almost all
people are armed and there is non proper regulation to limit
them.

<HEADLINE> Increased Overseas Investment In Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 13 (Xinhua) -- China's Liaoning province has
seen a sharp increase in overseas investment as more investors
move northward looking for business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning is one of China's key industrial bases with nearly a
third of its state-owned enterprises, and an improved investment
environment, according to Gao Guozhu, deputy provincial governor,
who says that it has attracted 18.6 billion US dollars in overseas
investment in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
A total of 15,530 foreign-funded enterprises have been
approved, and 6,500 have begun production.
</P>
<P>
Gao says that direct overseas cash inflows have increased 40
percent to 1.2 billion dollars over the past few months.
</P>
<P>
The province approved nearly 800 new foreign-funded projects in
the first half of the year, involving 2.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Gao says the rapid growth in overseas investment is due to
increased profits for foreign-funded ventures and an improving
local investment environment.
</P>
<P>
The numerous large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises are
also thought to have good potential by overseas investors, because
of the government's ambitious plan to fund reforms.
</P>
<P>
About 60 well-known multinationals have launched joint ventures
with local state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning is expected to give priority to petrochemical,
metallurgy, machine-building, and electronics industries to seek
overseas investment in the next few years, and overseas investment
will be directed to high-tech and tourism industries, and to
infrastructure projects.

favor white, red and green, according to a recent Horizon Survey &AMP;
Research study of 1,500 people in Beijing, Chongqing, Guangzhou,
Shanghai and Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
But blue, black, and purple are also high on the list, which
could prove useful to clothing manufacturers, interior decorators,
and car manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
And while most of these cities' residents have similar tastes,
there are still differences. People in Beijing like red and black
more, people in Guangzhou and Shanghai show white, blue and green,
while Chongqing and Xiamen's residents favor either warm colors or
cool colors.
</P>
<P>
Colors are quite closely related to sex and age, the survey
showed. Most females like white, red, yellow and black, while
males prefer blue and green.
</P>
<P>
In general, individual income doesn't seem to have much effect
on color preference, but urbanites are fond of blue more if they
earn more money, according to the survey.

<HEADLINE> Australia Receives Pictures From Chinese Weather </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Australia has started to
receive the first pictures from China's weather satellite launched
only two months ago, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Senator Ian Macdonald, parliamentary secretary to federal
Environment Minister Robert Hill, said the satellite Fengyun 2
(FY-2) would provide valuable data for weather forecasting and
climate prediction.
</P>
<P>
FY-2 is in a geostationary orbit over the Indian Ocean and is
similar in design to the Japanese weather satellites which have
monitored the weather over Australia since 1977.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mayor's Presidency Bid Shocks Political Circles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Seoul Mayor Cho Soon formally
announced today his bid for presidency in the December elections
in South Korea, making the situation of the presidential race
complicated.
</P>
<P>
Cho's bidding for presidency has long been considered a
decisive and variable factor in the presidential competition. The
campaign was originally a bout between Lee Hoi-chang, for the
ruling New Korea Party (NKP), Kim Dae-jung, candidate from the
major opposition National Congress for New Politics (NCNP) and Kim
Jong-pil, from a minor opposition party, the United Liberal
Democrats (ULD).
</P>
<P>
A Gallop-Chosun Daily joint opinion poll disclosed Tuesday that
18.9 percent of Kim Jong-pil's supporters, 15.8 percent of Lee
Hoi-chang's supporters and 12.5 percent of Kim Dae-jung's
supporters would switch to Mayor Cho.
</P>
<P>
Cho, a professor at Seoul National University, is the first
directly-elected mayor of Seoul which has almost 12 million
inhabitants or more than one fourth of the nation's total
population. He has a "clean" image before the public.
</P>
<P>
However, Cho's bid for presidency received no welcome from the
NKP, the NCNP and the ULD. The three parties are busy shoring up
their strategies to deal with the new situation.
</P>
<P>
In its first reaction to Cho's move, the NKP condemned it as a
"blatant betrayal" of citizens to pursue personal political
ambition.
</P>
<P>
The bid of Cho is expected to have a negative impact upon not
only the opposition, but also the ruling camp, for Cho is being
supported by the reform-minded, anti-political establishment
voting group.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the NKP's candidate Lee has been a declining in
popularity in the wake of the controversial military exemption of
his two sons.
</P>
<P>
The NCNP also suffered a lot from Cho's move as its candidate
Kim Dae-jung was enjoying increasing public support recently. The
NCNP called the bid of Cho a "selfish" act that will give an
unexpected win to the ruling camp, and demanded Cho get out of the
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
Cho's decision would cause a dispersal of the opposition,
jeopardizing its best opportunity to take power, explained the
NCNP.
</P>
<P>
Cho has strong contacts with the NCNP leader Kim and he even
won the Seoul mayoral election with the help of Kim and the NCNP.
</P>
<P>
However, the NCNP estimated that if the number of presidential
candidates increased, a united opposition candidate fielded by it
and the ULD might have a better chance of winning the December
election.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ULD, which is negotiating with the NCNP to field
a unified opposition candidate, decided to push the date for final
negotiations on the issue forward to early October, rather than
late October as originally planned.

HANGZHOU, August 13 (Xinhua) -- As of 18:00 tonight, the
Hangzhou Railway Administration passed its 2,300 accident-free
days, a record in its 48-year history.

percent, making things more difficult.
</P>
<P>
To maintain the good safety record, more than 30,000 officials

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses US, Britain of Blocking UN Approval </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today accused the United
States and Britain of blocking the approval of 142 outstanding
contracts, valued at some 87 million U.S. dollars, which need to
be endorsed by the U.N. sanctions committee.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf made the
accusation in a letter to the U.N. Secretary General, according to
the Iraqi News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said that despite the lapse of two months since the
termination of the first stage of the oil-for-food deal, there
remains 142 outstanding contracts due to U.S. and British
objections.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf urged the United Nations to expedite implementation of
the second stage of the deal which was signed between Iraq and the
U.N. in May last year, and to guarantee the arrival of supplies to
Iraq in accordance with the second distribution plan.
</P>
<P>
He said that 60 other contracts, valued at 18 million dollars,
were still unfinished by the sanctions committee.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf expressed the hope that the U.N. secretary General
would intervene for the early endorsement of the outstanding
contracts with the sanctions committee.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi foreign minister's letter takes place at a time when
Iraq is preparing to resume its oil exports to world markets.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council approved on August 4 Iraq's new plan
for the distribution of food and medical articles in the second
stage of the oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
The first stage of the deal went into effect last December and
on June 8 the U.N. Security Council agreed to extend it for another
six months.
</P>
<P>
The deal allows Iraq to export 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of
oil over six months to buy food and medicine for its people hard
hit by the U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraqi troops invaded
Kuwait in 1990.

<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>

years of guaranteed support for the poor, the Clinton
administration released figures Tuesday showing that public
assistance rolls continued to decline sharply with the percentage
of people on welfare at its lowest level since 1970.
</P>
<P>
-- The Palestinian Authority had to close its office in
Washington at midnight Tuesday because the Congress did not extend

<HEADLINE> Olympic Champ Wang Back to Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Olympic champion runner
Wang Junxia has returned to training after months of inaction
allegedly caused by a severe headache.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who snatched China's first Olympic running title from the
women's 5,000 meters and got a silver medal from the 10,000 meters
in Atlanta last summer, stopped training after her Olympic glory,
complaining a splitting headache.
</P>
<P>
The 1993 world champion said on Tuesday she had been training
for two weeks. Her coach Ma Dezhen said he expected Wang to regain
part of her former self by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
"My heart and lungs function well in training despite feeling a
bit tired," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Wang skipped the world athletics championships in Athens where
the Chinese failed to win a medal for the first time since the
inauguration of the event in 1983.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who still holds the 10,000 meters world record, said an
expected poor performance by the Chinese in Athens was part of
reason she resumed training. However, she declined to disclose her
immediate goal of training, saying she didn't want too much
presure on her shoulders.
</P>
<P>
In the 1993 world championships, China bagged four gold medals
including the one Wang got from the 10,000 meters. Her teammates
from northeast China's Liaoning province, Qu Yunxia and Liu Dong,
won the 3,000 meters and 800 meters respectively. The other gold
was won by women's shot-putter Huang Zhihong, who finished fourth
in Athens.

<HEADLINE> Guangxi Drops Irrational Fees to Foreign-Funded Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The government of China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region announced today that it would
abolish 60 types of fees for foreign-funded companies.
</P>
<P>
The first group of fees to be abolished are related to city
planning, road construction, water supplies, tourism, and other
areas, said Zhang Wenxue, vice-chairman of the region. The
regional government will continue to abolish other irrational fees.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, the region had attracted about 5.4 billion
US dollars in foreign fund which have been used in more than 4,000
foreign-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of this year, the region used 454 million
in foreign investment, up 8.4 percent from the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the region has built convenient a ground, sea and air
transportation system, efficient energy industry and good posts
and telecommunications network.
</P>
<P>
However, excessive non-tax fees have caused major problems in
the management of foreign-funded companies, he pointed out, so
reducing or abolishing those is now at the top of the government's
agenda, he said.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Businessmen Call for Mild Tax System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian businessmen are calling
for a mild tax system in a bid to vitalize the country's small and
medium enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The National News Agency reported today that the participants
in the All-Ukrainian Congress of Entrepreneurs, which concluded
Tuesday, severely criticized the present tax system. They claimed
extortionate actions by local officials targeted at entrepreneurs,
had resulted in the extension of a shadow economy and lack of
competitiveness by Ukrainian products.
</P>
<P>
They suggested the government take advantage of the vast
potential of small and medium businesses, which are highly
flexible and can quickly adapt to market demands in providing
required commodities and services.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are only 93,000 small and medium businesses
operating in Ukraine. They employ 10 percent of the total labor
force, while the number of small and medium enterprises stand at
two million in Poland.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing after the congress, Deputy Prime Minister
Sergei Tigipko said the government must support small businesses.
</P>
<P>
If the tax burden is eased, small businesses in the country
will be able to provide new jobs and new budget revenues soon,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Tigipko urged the government, parliament and president to make
joint efforts to create conditions for the development of small
and medium enterprises, adding that "neither the government, nor
the parliament or the president can solve these problems
single-handedly."

<HEADLINE> Thai Employers Urged to Ease Layoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 13 (Xinhua) -- the Thai Labor and Social
Welfare Ministry are urging employers nationwide to seek
alternative ways to layoff as the employment situation is being
aggravated by the economic downturn in the country.
</P>
<P>
The call was made in a letter issued recently to work places by
the ministry, which contained guidelines to employers on the
matter, according to local media today.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, the ministry proposed that employers choose to
cut production costs through ways like energy saving, management
improvement and reduction of unnecessary expenditures before they
consider dismissing workers.
</P>
<P>
If employers have to cut their labor costs, the ministry
suggested that employers should cut overtime work, reduce the
number of employees working everyday, and waive benefits like
awards and parties for workers, instead of laying off workers.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also recommended employers to readjust work
positions for workers, refraining from recruiting new employees
and considering re-posting existing employees at their workplaces
first.
</P>
<P>
The management personnel should be cut more than junior
employees and those workers inefficient and with less family
burden should be considered first, the ministry noted.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the ministry urged employers to push ahead
voluntary retirement programs for senior employees aged 50-55
while providing benefits and welfare agreed by both sides.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministry called for employers to lay off workers
in accordance with the existing labor law and give them the right
to return later. It also urged employers to provide proper
benefits and necessary training for employees laid off to help
them find new jobs.

<HEADLINE> Kinkel Reiterates Call to Reduce Bonn's Payment to EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel joined Finance Minister Theo Waigel today in calling for a
"fair burden-sharing system" in the European Union (EU), aimed at
reducing German's proportion of financial contributions to the EU.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the German newspaper General Anzeiger,
Kinkel urged the finding of "a fairer system" to reduce the
country's payment to the EU.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel's remarks followed a similar call made by Waigel on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It is not going to work in the long run that only one country,
Germany, shoulders 60 percent of the total EU spendings," Waigel
said, adding that Germany had become less well-off after its
reunification in 1990.
</P>
<P>
He said Germany currently contributed more than 20 billion
marks (11 billion U.S. dollars) annually to the EU, 0.6 percent of
its gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Germany should have paid six to seven billion marks (3.2 to 3.8
billion dollars) a year to the EU, accounting for about 0.4
percent of its GDP, Waigel said.
</P>
<P>
Although Bonn's request for less payment to the EU has been
sharply criticized by France, Kinkel said he did not believe that
it would create new problems between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He denied that Bonn's new demand was motivated by an
Europe-fatigue in Germany, stressing Germany would and must push
ahead European integration.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kinkel called on the EU to cut spendings, saying
that the planned EU expansion to Eastern Europe should not result
in additional financial burden on its current member
countries.

<HEADLINE> Center to Protect Ecology at Yangtze's Source </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- China's first non-government
ecology protection center will be set up next month at Keke Sheili
near the Yangtze River's source, on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
</P>
<P>
Its purpose is to serve as a base for local environmental
protection, providing lodging and equipment for people fighting
game poachers in the region.
</P>
<P>
Keke Sheili covers some 90,000 sq.km. and is China's largest
unpopulated area and best-preserved nature reserve. It is home to a
large number of rare animals, such as the Tibetan Antelope, under
state protection.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the center can provide the needed conditions for people
combating illegal game hunting and protect the region's biological
diversity," said Yang Xin, the center's major backer.
</P>
<P>
Yang has been to the river's source six times, and recently
published a book on his experiences along the river. Profits of
book sales will be used for the center.
</P>
<P>
This winter, a local anti-poaching group and volunteers will
patrol the region using the center as their base. Next year plans
are to have scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences use
the station for research on glaciers, plants, and the environment
near the river's source.
</P>
<P>
Construction work will begin on the center this month, with
labor provided by volunteers from across China who will pay their
own travel expenses and bring sleeping-bags, tents, food, and
utensils to the building site, which is 4,600 m. above sea level.

<HEADLINE> NATO Forces Taking Heavy Weapons From Serbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Stabilization Protection
Forces (SFOR) in Bosnia have started to take heavy weapons away
from the Serb paramilitary units, a North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Francois le Blevennec, NATO media liaison official in Brussels,
said under the Dayton peace accord, the Serb paramilitary units
and special police brigades are allowed to keep certain types of
weaponry, but not tanks or armored personnel carriers.
</P>
<P>
No illegal weapons were found after NATO forces made their
first inspection on August 9 of a Bosnian Serb police force, which
was believed to be loyal to Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic,
now an indicted war criminal.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton peace accord, le Blevennec said the Serb
paramilitary units are required to report their weapons and store
them in proper places for inspection, making sure that the weapons
are not used improperly or moved.
</P>
<P>
"It is understandable for police forces to hold light weaponry
such as pistols but certainly not 150 mm cannon guns or bazookas,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
NATO supreme commander General Wesley Clark has decided to move
against the special police brigades which are believed to have
provided protection for indicted war criminals.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, General Eric Shinseki, the new commander of the
NATO-led SFOR troops in Bosnia, discussed with Momcilo Krajisnik,
an ally of Karadzic, new restrictions on the 3,000 special police
units in the Serb-controlled of Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<HEADLINE> Surveying Ruins Of Kublai Khan's Capital With Aerial Photography </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The capital of Kublai Khan's
empire, which Western readers of "Marco Polo's Travel Notes" and
Coleridge know as "Xuanadu", will be able to see it better through
aerial photography now.
</P>
<P>
The ruins have been overgrown with grass for more than 600
years, but this September a Sino-German archaeology team will take
photos of the site in Zhenglan Banner in the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region, from a Yun-five cargo plane flying at low
altitudes.
</P>
<P>
"By analyzing the photos we may tell the capital site's shape
and where the relics are," said Dr. Song Baoquan of Germany's Ruhr
University in Bochum, who is in charge of the survey.
</P>
<P>
The capital, Shangdu (Xuanadu), was built in 1256 under the
command of Kublai Khan who was enthroned there four years
later. It became a summer resort after the Yuan Dynasty
(1271-1368) moved its capital to present-day Beijing and was
destroyed during a peasant war at the end of the dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Historical records show that there were three concentric city
walls. Inside the 8.5-km outer wall were markets and residences;
inside the middle ring were temples and government buildings.
</P>
<P>
The imperial palaces were in the inner circle, which was about
half the size of the Palace Museum in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
According to "Marco Polo's Travel Notes", there were palaces
made of marble, with the rooms gilded and painted, and which were
so exquisite that people derived both visual and mental
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
This record was proven to be true when archaeologists unearthed
large marble steps, pillar bases, and glazed tile ends bearing
design of celestial animal figures in some building ruins on the
city axis.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that our survey and further excavation based on it
will help prove what was described in `Marco Polo's Travel
Notes'," says Yang Lin, director of the new research center of
remote sensing and aerial photography of China's National Museum
of Chinese History.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Shangdu, the joint team will also do an aerial
photographic survey of large sites like the two capitals of the
Liao Dynasty (916-1125).

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- A German food company has once
again been targeted by unknown blackmailers, who claim to have
poisoned the company's products.
</P>
<P>
Thomy, a German subsidiary of Switzerland's Nestle concern,
received an anonymous letter warning that its products in more
than 50 stores in 14 German cities have been poisoned, police said
late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Police did not say how much the blackmailers demanded but there
were speculations that they were pressing for 25 million German
marks (13.5 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Police have not found any poisoned food so far.
</P>
<P>
The Frankfurt-based company has been targeted by blackmailers
since early 1996. Last April, police found several tubes of Thomy
mustard and mayonnaise poisoned with cyanide in supermarkets in
the German cities of Saarbruecken and Regensburg, after receiving
a similar extortion letter.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Administrator Supports Abacha's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The military administrator of
Lagos State, Nigeria's commercial center said he would support
the head of state, General Sani Abacha if he decides to contest
the 1998 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Mohammed Marwa made the statement on Tuesday on Ray
Power, a local private radio and the African Independent
Television.
</P>
<P>
He said that General Abacha, as the most experienced general
the nation has produced, is qualified for the position.
</P>
<P>
"If General Abacha runs, I will support him. But if he decides
not to run, I will respect his judgement," said Marwa.
</P>
<P>
He further explained that General Abacha is the first military
officer to go through all the ranks before becoming a general.
</P>
<P>
"He did not skip any rank. He also passed through all the
command structures before he became the commander-in-chief, so if
he decides to contest as an experienced public servant, I will
support him," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Taking over the power in November 1993 from Ernest Shonekan's
interim national government, General Abacha has promised that his
military government will give up power to an elected government
in October, 1998.
</P>
<P>
His own presidency has been a subject of much speculations and
controversies ever since the announcement of the transition to
civil rule program in October, 1995.
</P>
<P>
General Abacha said early this year that whether or not he
will contest will be decided by his own constituency.
</P>
<P>
He further said that it is not new for military rulers in
Africa or indeed in the world to take off their uniform and run
for presidency.

<HEADLINE> Peruvian Student Jailed in Malaysia for Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 13 (Xinhua) -- A Peruvian student was
sentenced to three years in jail by a Malaysian High Court today
after he pleaded guilty to charges of possessing cocaine.
</P>
<P>
Jorge Enrique Pellon Tellon, 20, escaped the mandatory death
penalty when Justice Faiza Thamby Chik of the High Court in Shah
Alam, Selangor State, amended the charges from trafficking to
bringing the drug into the country in transit, the Malaysian
national news agency Bernama said.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian student was arrested at the Kuala Lumpur
International Airport on November 26 last year when the security
officers found 2,525 grams of cocaine in nine plastic packets
glued to his shorts. At a local police lock-up the same day, 560
grams of white powder containing cocaine was found in his two
plastic packets .
</P>
<P>
Under Section 21 (6) applied in this case, anyone who brings
any dangerous drug in transit is guilty of an offense and is
liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding 20,000 ringgit (about
8,000 U.S. dollars) or a maximum jail term of five years, or both.
</P>
<P>
After the judge passed sentence, Tellon, looking relieved, said
that he would not repeat the offense in future.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Restates Position on S. Leona Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has reiterated its
determination to restore Sierra Leone's civilian government led
by President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah ousted in the May 25 coup, saying
the commitment was "unshakable".
</P>
<P>
The position of the Nigerian government on the current
situation in Sierra Leone was predicated on its concern for peace
and stability in the west African sub-region, said Chief Mike
Onoja, director general of the Ministry of Defense on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the crisis in the troubled country, if not
carefully managed, could jeopardize Nigeria's efforts in
establishing peace and stability in west Africa.
</P>
<P>
The official, who described the coup as uncalled for, said the
actions of the elements in Sierra Leone was characterized by
looting and wanton destruction of lives and property.
</P>
<P>
It was especially so when coup soldiers invited the rebel
Revolutionary United Front personnel, numbering thousands, out of
their forest positions into the center of Freetown, capital of
the country.
</P>
<P>
The group of fighters now "virtually overwhelmed the Sierra
Leone armed forces", he said, adding that soldiers and the rebel
fighters had "systematically vandalized" Freetown and its
environs.
</P>
<P>
The situation is worsening in Sierra Leone with tightened
economic sanctions imposed by the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) after the military in power said it would
not step down until the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
As reported diplomatic moves are underway to resume talks
between the junta and ECOWAS for peaceful settlement of the
crisis, the Nigerian government on Tuesday ordered a ban on
exporting petroleum products to the beleaguered country.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIDAIHE, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng met
with a senior Cambodian delegation led by Cambodian acting head of
state Chea Sim here today.
</P>
<P>
Chea Sim said that leaders of all Cambodian parties are
visiting Beijing to present a working report on the recent
situation in Cambodia to King Norodom Sihanouk, who received the
delegation on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be conducive to the political stability and
peaceful development in the country, said Chea.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Cambodia will continue to stick to the "one
China" policy, and expressed his hope that the friendly
relationship of cooperation between the two countries will keep
growing.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China, a friendly neighbor to Cambodia, attaches
great concern to the development of that country's domestic
situation.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China pursues the Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence, and will not interfere in internal policies of other
countries.
</P>
<P>
A nation's independence and sovereignty must be respected, he
said, adding that the Cambodian issue should be resolved by its
people themselves.
</P>
<P>
After years of chaotic war, Cambodia needs a stable situation
and must concentrate its efforts on economic construction, said Li.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Premier pointed out that good natural conditions
will ensure that the rejuvenation of Cambodia is just around the
corner as long as proper policies can be implemented.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, the Chinese side holds that King Norodom
Sihanouk is loved by his people and he also enjoys high prestige
outside the country. "Respecting the King's role and influence
conforms to the interests of the Cambodian people," Li stressed.
</P>
<P>
China has consistently maintained that the peace process in
Cambodia should be promoted in accordance with the principles and
spirit expounded in the Paris Agreement, he said, adding that the
constitution and political framework of Cambodia should be
safeguarded, and the national election held on time.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of Ung Huot and Hun Sen, Cambodia's two
prime ministers, Chea expressed gratitude to the Chinese side for
providing convenience to the delegation during its stay in
Beijing.

<HEADLINE> China to Standardize Non-State-Run Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The State Council, China's highest
administrative body, has promulgated a set of new regulations,
effective October 1, to standardize schools run by organizations
or individuals.
</P>
<P>
Non-government-run schools are booming as a result of
increasing demands for education as a result of economic growth
and social progress.
</P>
<P>
State Education Commission (SEC) statistics show that China now
has 50,000 non-government-run kindergartens, primary schools,
middle schools and higher education institutions, which are
staffed by 400,000 teachers and serve 9.8 million students.
</P>
<P>
The regulations, signed by Chinese Premier Li Peng in July,
state the central government will provide greater support for
non-state schools, while improving management of and supervon over
them.
</P>
<P>
Teachers and students will enjoy equal rights as their
counterparts in state-run schools and universities, according to
the regulations.
</P>
<P>
"The state will strictly control the number of nongovernmental
colleges and universities," the regulations state, adding that
emphasis should be placed on vocational, adult, middle school and
pre-school education.
</P>
<P>
China currently has 1,032 institutions of higher
education and 1,138 colleges for adults, as well as 1,100
non-state universities.
</P>
<P>
"Improving the teaching quality and efficiency of higher
education should be realized by adjusting, merging and
establishing close cooperation between colleges and making full
use of available quipment, instead of by blindly increasing the
number of schools," said SEC official Huang Yao.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations ban the opening of schools for the sole
purpose of earning profits. According to Huang, "China prohibits
organizations or individuals from opening schools simply for
profit."
</P>
<P>
The State Council will formulate another set of regulations
governing the opening in China of schools by overseas
organizations and individuals or the opening of schools by them in
cooperation with their Chinese colleagues.

<HEADLINE> Coastal Province Aids Inland Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Northwestern China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region and Shandong, a moderately developed
coastal province, have launched various cooperative projects to
eradicate poverty.
</P>
<P>
China introduced a nationwide anti-poverty campaign in 1994 to
help some 80 million people rise above the poverty line by the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang is striving to meet the deadline by tapping natural
resources and enhancing cooperation with the rapidly developing
coastal province.
</P>
<P>
The two localities introduced 30 cooperative projects in
Xinjiang during 1996 alone. The wide-ranging projects, valued at
over 277 million yuan, cover the industrial, agricultural,
education and infrastructure construction sectors.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang expects the projects to yield added value of well over
500 million yuan and earn pretax profits of some 40 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Shandong and Xinjiang have also established close cooperative
ties in cotton production, highway construction and energy
development.
</P>
<P>
The Shandong Lingxian Cotton Spinning Plant and Qingdao First
Cotton Spinning Plant and various other cotton processors from
throughout the province invested 40 million yuan to establish
cotton production bases covering 80,000 ha. in Xinjiang's Aksu and
Kashgar prefectures. The bases have already supplied the investors
with over 40,000 tons of cotton.
</P>
<P>
Shandong has also helped Xinjiang build three sections of
high-grade highways, and has invested another 10 million yuan in
the construction of water supply facilities, roads and
high-tension lines in rural Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six prefectures and cities in Xinjiang have formed close
cooperative ties with cities in Shandong.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai IT Industry Hit by Financial Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's information
technology (IT) industry is facing a hard time as the measures
taken by the government recently to win international aid to prop
up the country's economy might pinch the growth of the industry
this year.
</P>
<P>
The government's announcement on August 5 to suspend operations
of 42 more finance firms apparently dealt a major blow to local IT
business operators, directly or indirectly.
</P>
<P>
IT companies having loans from these firms are now busy
settling their loans, which further worsens the cash-flow problems
they are facing. Some of them have to slow down their purchasing
or expansion plans or choose to cut staff salaries for survival.
</P>
<P>
The value-added tax increase from 7 percent to 10 percent
effective on August 16 and the floating of the baht also have a
direct impact on end-users, whose purchasing power has already
been weakened by the country's economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the pending 1998 fiscal budget cut will probably
affect the future development projects of the IT industry,
including the software park, the government information network
and Thaisarn III, which are to be implemented between 1998 and
2002.
</P>
<P>
Government agencies are working on the details of the budget
cut for specific sectors.
</P>
<P>
However, Sompong Amornvivat, minister to the Prime Minister's
Office who chairs Thailand's National IT Committee (NITC), said
that the three projects involving a total of 4.2 billion baht (140
million U.S. dollars) will not be targeted as Thailand regards the
IT industry as a sunrise industry.
</P>
<P>
The development of the IT industry will be fully encouraged
also due to the country's commitment to liberalizing the sector by
2005 under the IT agreement of the World Trade Organization, he
said.
</P>
<P>
But local IT business operators said that the growth of the IT
industry in Thailand is expected to be at zero this year due to
the government measures.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government on August 5 began to push ahead with a
fiscal reform plan in a bid to win the financial aid from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) to help bail out its financial
crisis caused by the Baht depreciation. Measures under the plan
include streamlining the finance sector, raising taxes, cutting
government budget and maintaining the baht floatation.
</P>
<P>
The IT industry, one of Thailand's major foreign exchange
earners with an annual export of 100 billion baht (3.3 billion
U.S. dollars), is among the businesses affected by the government
measures.

<HEADLINE> Belgium's Central Bank Not to Raise Interest Rate Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Belgian bankers and economists
were soothed by the news that the German Bundesbank opted Tuesday
to leave its market-guiding interest rate unchanged, at least for
another week.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise the Belgians, like the Austrians, Dutch and French,
would have to raise their interest rates in an effort to secure
their currencies which are tied to the mark in Europe's
exchange rate system.
</P>
<P>
But an interest-rate increase will be painful and unpopular as
the economic growths in these countries are already slow.
</P>
<P>
While the Deutsche mark was trading at 1.8638 for the
U.S. dollar in Frankfurt, Belgian francs weakened further to 38.43
for the dollar, reaching a record low since early 1995 when the
Mexican peso crisis bolstered the Belgian franc to an exchange
rate of well under 30 for the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The German securities repurchase agreement rate, the benchmark
for the financial markets, has been frozen at a record-low 3
percent since last August despite the fact that the dollar rose to
fetch 1.89 marks last week.
</P>
<P>
The German central bankers will be meeting next Friday to
decide whether to raise the key interest rate to probably a small
and symbolic increase.
</P>
<P>
Julian Jessop, an economist at the Nikko Securities in London,
predicted that no matter the Bundesbank raises rates or not, the
mark will continue to weaken because of fears of a soft single
currency, coupled by a record unemployment of above 11 percent and
a slow economy.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Halts Huge Loan to Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank will not
disburse the 71.6-million-U.S.-Dollar structural adjustment
credit to Kenya until several conditions are implemented, the
Daily Nation newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
However, existing projects are not affected by the decision
although no new projects will be presented to the World Bank
board for approval until Kenya's social and political situation
has improved, said Harold Wackman, the bank's country director
for Kenya and Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
The bank fully supported the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
on its insistence on good governance and reduction of corruption
before release of its aid package, he stressed in a statement
issued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He also specified measures including the privatization of the
country's telecommunications sector, progress in streamlining the
energy sector and putting in place the necessary framework for
economic growth as important conditions for Kenya to get World
Bank loans.
</P>
<P>
His statement is widely treated as a further indicator that
this east African country is in for a hard time over what is seen
as its slow pace of economic reforms and corruption.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the World Bank has approved the release of a
125-million-Dollar credit to expand Kenya's power system and
upgrade its geothermal resources.
</P>
<P>
But the World Bank has insisted on the revision of certain
clauses in the contracts for Iberafrica and Westmont, both of
whom are independent power producers, said Wackman.
</P>
<P>
Some of the clauses relate to environmental safety, fuel
supplies to the two producers and so on.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank is keeping a "close watch" on its current
projects given the prevailing adverse conditions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, the IMF froze its 215-million-Dollar aid
package to Kenya citing high-level corruption as a key reason,
which leads to a steep decline of the Shilling against Dollar.

<HEADLINE> China's Modernization Drive Guaranteed by Better Legal System (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Since 1992, China has worked to
improve its legal system, and can now claim a faster law-making
process, tougher law-enforcement policies and a greater awareness
of the law among the people.
</P>
<P>
Since the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) was held in 1992, the country has been in a period of
transition from a planned economy to a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
In the course of the change, the National People's Congress
(NPC) and its Standing Committee have set as a priority the
formulation of laws, especially those concerning economic affairs,
to push forward the country's reform.
</P>
<P>
When the Eighth NPC Standing Committee began its work in early
1993, it mapped out a plan to establish a legal framework for the
socialist market economy during its five-year term.
</P>
<P>
Up to July 3 of this year, the Eighth NPC and its Standing
Committee passed 111 laws and decisions concerning laws, 40 of
which are related to the market economy.
</P>
<P>
The laws those standardizing the market operation, safeguarding
market order, tightening macro-economic control, improving social
security, boosting infrastructure and pillar industries, and
promoting the opening of China to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Now a large number of laws are serving the market economy,
including measures against unfair competition, protection of
consumers' rights and interests, registered accountants, budgets,
foreign trade, urban real estate, labor, auditing, arbitration,
advertisement, banking, bills, insurance and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Eighth NPC and its Standing Committee have
adopted laws on combating crimes, safeguarding public security,
advancing the development of science, technology and culture,
environmental protection, rationally developing resources, and
enhancing national defense.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, some laws which could not meet the needs of
the market economy were revised.

While formulating more laws, the Eighth NPC Standing Committee
has given equal attention to law-enforcement. Over the past five
years, the Standing Committee has inspected the implementation of
21 laws and decisions. Some special committees under the Standing
Committee have also reviewed the implementation of dozens of laws
and decisions.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the Standing Committee has looked into the
implementation of decisions and laws on drug use, public security,
food hygiene, medicine management, product quality, and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the CPC Central Committee, the NPC Standing
Committee and the State Council have made concerted efforts to
promote a better understanding of the law.
</P>
<P>
Since December 9, 1994, China's senior leaders have on five
separate occasions attended lectures on the law. Chinese President
Jiang Zemin has participated in all the lectures and made speeches
to raise people's awareness of the need to know about the legal
system and laws.
</P>
<P>
Following the example of their senior leaders, officials at
various levels and the public have learned to deal with problems
by legal means.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, an estimated 700 million people have
received a basic education of China's laws, and they have become
more able to protect their legitimate rights and interests and
carry out their duties.
</P>
<P>
China's legal services have also boomed: The number of lawyers
offices has shot up from 3,600 in 1993 to more than 8,200. Last
year, lawyers across the country handled more than 700,000 cases,
an increase of 90 percent over 1993.

<HEADLINE> Finance Minister: Nigerian Economy Yet to Bounce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Finance Minister Chief
Anthony Ani has acknowledged that the national economy has not
been bounced back despite the gains achieved in the macro-economic
side.
</P>
<P>
Real growth was still below expectations and the government
still needed to promote it, he told bankers gathering in the
capital Abuja on Tuesday to mark the formal change of name of
Nigerian International Bank to Citi Bank Nigeria, a subsidiary of
the U.S. Citibank.
</P>
<P>
The minister listed the government's achievements as prudence
in the public sector finance, elimination of fiscal deficits,
monetary discipline, reduction of inflation, a build-up of
foreign reserves and the steady appreciation of the local
currency Naira.
</P>
<P>
Earlier official figures show that Nigeria's inflation rate
declined from 28 percent in December last year to 17.5 percent in
June. It is projected at 15.5 percent for July and 13.8 for
August.
</P>
<P>
Foreign reserves also rose from last year's 4.08 billion U.S.
Dollars to 7.4 billion at present, while the exchange rate
changed from 85 Naira to one dollar to around 83 to one.
unconfirmed report said earlier the Nigerian government had set a
75 to one target for this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Ani, the country still needs to improve real
growth by encouraging other foreign investors to emulate Citibank
and by implementing other policy initiatives such as
privatization.
</P>
<P>
The minister reiterated the government's commitment to provide
the much-needednk enabling environment as it embarks on reforming
the banking and financial sector.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Restates Territorial Claim Over Bakassi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has restated its
territorial claim over the Bakassi Peninsula, which is also
claimed by neighboring Cameroun.
</P>
<P>
The statement by Chief Mike Onoja, director-general of the
Ministry of Defense in Lagos came in expectation of impending
decision on the dispute by the Hague International Court.
</P>
<P>
Onoja made the statement at the opening session of the 1997
defense advisers annual conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Disputes over the peninsula has led to constant clashes
between Nigeria and Cameroun in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's claim to Bakassi is borne out of the indisputable
fact that the area is located at its southeast tip and at least
90 percent of its population are the Efik and Efut people of
Nigeria, Onoja said.
</P>
<P>
He continued that it is the discovery of oil in commercial
quantity that raised Cameroun's interests in Bakassi, who in 1971
established the Jubane district in the area.
</P>
<P>
Onoja condemned the the Marua declaration of 1975 which gave
Bakassi to Cameroun, adding that it is invalid because Nigeria
never ratified it.
</P>
<P>
He further said that Nigeria's preference for peaceful
resolution of the dispute should not been seen as a sign of
weakness.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Orders Release of Funds to Cope with El Nino </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Ramos has
ordered the release of 500 million pesos (18 million U.S. dollars)
to develop small water impounding projects to mitigate the effects
of the El Nino, a senior agricultural official said today.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Secretary Salvador Escudero said that there will be
a 40 percent reduction in rainfall as a result of the El Nino
which is set to hit the country during the latter part of the
year.
</P>
<P>
The southern islands of Mindanao are expected to be greatly
affected by the decrease in rainfall and are one of the priority
areas where the Agricultural Department is fast-tracking its
irrigation projects.
</P>
<P>
Escudero said small river irrigation systems have been
completed in Mindanao while small water impounding projects
consisting of small farm reservoirs and shallow tube walls are now
underway.
</P>
<P>
The National Irrigation Administration has reported that two
river irrigation systems in the area have been completed and
several projects are going on to provide water to rice-producing
areas dependent on rain water.
</P>
<P>
The government has also taken other steps to help counter the
adverse effects of the El Nino including intensive information
campaign and dissemination of the proper techniques for the use
and management of impounding project.
</P>
<P>
El Nino is a large-scale oceanographic and meteorological
phenomenon that develops in the Pacific Ocean and is associated
with extreme climatic variability such as devastating rains, winds
and drought.

BANGKOK, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is expected to have its
first agriculture futures market soon as the government gave the
green light to the establishment of the market.

<P>
The cabinet recently has approved the setting up of the

However, the budget of 1 billion baht (about 30 million U.S.

will be cut in line with the government's policy to tighten
spending, according to Siripol Yodmuangcharoen, director general
of the Internal Trade Department.
</P>
<P>
The department will choose to lease equipment rather than buy
it to create the market, while urging the private sector to
participate in the scheme, Siripol was quoted as saying by local

<HEADLINE> World Bank Loans Benefit Liaoning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 13 (Xinhua) -- World Bank loans have helped
northeast China's Liaoning Province overcome a budget crunch
restricting agricultural development, with local farmers
benefiting greatly from the completion of 25 major projects.
</P>
<P>
The aforementioned projects have generated profits of over 350
million yuan (42 million US dollars) since 1994 when the province
received World Bank loans to develop local agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The projects have produced a total of 70 million kg of grain,
16 million kg of vegetables and seven million kg of meat.
</P>
<P>
Local officials report that the province has received World
Bank loans totalling 60 million US dollars, with all funds
earmarked for local agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
Loans have been used to develop a total of 20,000 ha. of rice
paddies and irrigated fields, 1,000 ha. of medicinal herbs and
8,600 ha. of apple orchards.
</P>
<P>
Other loans have been used to construct township enterprises,
including paper mills and juice manufacturing plants.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, "Liaoning invested four billion
in agricultural sectors between 1991-1995 period, with the ensuing
influx of World Bank loans greatly easing the tight budget for
related projects."
</P>
<P>
World Bank loans are extremely important for promoting local
economic development in townships in poverty-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
Xinli Township, Beining City, used World Bank loans to raise
local grain output by 22.5 million kg. The loans enabled the
township to escape poverty and embark on the road to wealth.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Indonesia
today agreed to upgrade communication channels by considering
using electronic mail (E-mail), among other options, to make their
combined operations against illegal immigrants more effective.
</P>
<P>
Both countries also agreed to intensify exchange of
intelligence to check smuggling by sea and intercept vessels
polluting the straits as Indonesia viewed smuggling by sea very
seriously.
</P>
<P>
The agreements were reached at the Malaysia-Indonesia Maritime
Operations Planning Team's sixth meeting here today, according to
the Malaysian national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
The team has declared interception of Indonesian illegal
immigrants crossing the Malacca Straits to sneak into peninsular
Malaysia as among its top priority mission.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian delegation to the meeting was led by Rear Admiral
Tuan Hashim Tuan Mohamed, director of the Maritime Enforcement
Coordination Center of the National Security Division in the Prime
Minister' Department and the Indonesian side was led by the
Tanjung Pinang-based commander of the Western Armada Naval
Security Region, First Admiral Rosihan Arysad, Bernama said.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of Indonesian illegal immigrants features
prominently on the agenda. The Indonesian side has informed us
they have several strategies to curb entry via illegal channels,"
Tuan Hashim was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tuan Hashim said the Malacca Straits is a vital international
waterway especially for oil tankers. About 30,000 vessels use it
annually, excluding for fishing activities and ferry movements
involving people of both countries who depended on the straits for
their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
On Indonesian illegal immigrants, Tuan Hashim said Malaysian
maritime agencies had detained altogether 5,274 of them last year,
including 2,358 intercepted in the Malacca Straits. Up to June
this year, 1,705 were arrested including 533 in the straits.
</P>
<P>
Tuan Hashim said 60 cases of sea pollution were detected last
year, including 32 in the straits. This year, 15 sea pollution
cases have been reported so far with eight in the straits.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Cleans up Rivers, Lakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- As someone who lives in a
residential area next to the Shangri-la Hotel in western Beijing
-- one of the most sought-after accommodations in the city -- Zhan
Yonglin shouldn't have much to complain about.
</P>
<P>
But he did have one big gripe: For years, piles of garbage lay
on the bank of the creek directly in front of his apartment
building. Sick of the sight, Zhan phoned the Municipal Rivers and
Lakes Administration Office.
</P>
<P>
Within a few weeks, the garbage was removed by city sanitation
workers, who also planted Chinese scholartrees up and down the
creek bank, turning it into an attractive garden.
</P>
<P>
Zhan's case is just one episode in the city's current drive to
beautify its rivers and lakes. Since last spring, Beijing's public
sanitation workers have removed close to 40,000 cu m of garbage on
the banks of rivers and lakes around the city, and fished out
about 4,400 cu m of trash from the water.
</P>
<P>
There are 22 lakes in Beijing, which are connected into a
single system by 19 rivers. The rivers and lakes add spots of
color and a breath of fresh air to the arid capital city in the
inland. Unfortunately, they have not been spared from the
pollution of human waste, which has become an urban problem in
developing China.
</P>
<P>
To clean up Beijing's waters, municipal departments will move
some farm and sideline produce markets on river- and lakeside
areas that are highly pollutive to other places, said Liu
Shanrong, chief of the Municipal River and Lake Administration
Office.
</P>
<P>
She added that the simple-style housing in these places used as
temporary residence for migrant workers will be torn down in the
course of Beijing's urban reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the clean-up drive, a 12-km section of Beijing's
inner city moat has been renovated for a more scenic appearance,
and now has a landscape featuring clear water, and trees, flowers
and lawns on the banks. Many local residents spend their leisure
time here.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, the residents are finding that Beijing's waters in
general have become cleaner than before.
</P>
<P>
In an unprecedented water diversion project, some 100 million
cu m of clean water had been diverted from the Guanting reservoir,
one of Beijing's water sources, to cleanse the rivers and lakes
after the spring thaw. The project took more than three months.
</P>
<P>
According to the city, there are 14 automatic precipitation
measuring stations across the city. A computer network connecting
them will report every one mm increase in precipitation during the
rainy seasons, giving guidance for when and how much water should
be diverted.
</P>
<P>
As the next step, the city will soon begin to remove the silt
in the rivers and lakes that has accumulated over past
decades.

NAIROBI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Overall inflation continued to
fall last month due to improved supplies of basic food following
increased agricultural production, according to the August issue

The overall month-on-month inflation declined to 4.9 percent
in July compared with 10.2 percent in May and 7.6 percent in

have started to contact for resuming the arms deal.
</P>
<P>
Turkey canceled the order last year after Washington suspended
the delivery of three Navy frigates to Ankara, which was termed
as a shadow embargo on Turkey imposed by the U.S. because of the
strong pressure from anti-Turkish lobbies, most of them
Greek-Americans.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Clinton administration gave Ankara positive
signals that the U.S. would like to go ahead with the frigate
delivery.
</P>
<P>
The same sources, however, made it clear that Turkey will make
its decision in accordance with the U.S. attitude concerning its
arms trade with Ankara.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey will never renew its chopper request unless it
receives assurance by Washington on the transfer of the arms
without any problem," the source said.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon is now studying Turkey's consideration and
contacting with Turkish military in order to resume the Super
Cobra helicopter deal, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Bell-Texton Company are also optimistic
about the resumption of the chopper order, saying they are
always keen to deal with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said that Israeli lobbyists in Washington have
played a key role in persuading the Clinton administration to
break the shadow embargo against Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Turkey have rapidly strengthened their relations,
especially in the defense field, following the signing of a
number of military accords in the past two years, triggering
grave concern among Arab nations.

<HEADLINE> Hani Assassinated to Create Chaos in S. Africa: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Former South Africa's
Communist Party (SACP) leader Chris Hani was killed in order to
plunge the country into chaos and prepare ground for a right-wing
coup, one of his murderers Clive Derby-Lewis has revealed.
</P>
<P>
In his application for amnesty before the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission, convicted murderer and former
Conservative Party leader Derby-Lewis said yesterday that many
right wingers saw Hani as military target because of his status as
military leader of African National Congress (ANC).
</P>
<P>
The fact that Hani was considered a possible successor to
President Nelson Mandela as head of state also made him a
priority political target, Derby-Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
The right wingers thought that by killing Hani, they would
realize their objective of plunging the country into a situation
of chaos, which, would then lead to the takeover of political
power by the Conservative Party.
</P>
<P>
Derby-Lewis denied that the Conservative Party was bent on
perpetrating apartheid, but argued that the right-wingers was
involved in a just war like the ANC "to secure ourselves a place
in the sun".
</P>
<P>
Derby-Lewis and Polish immigrant Janusz Walus have applied for
amnesty for killing Hani at his Boksburg home on April 10, 1993.
Both are serving life sentences. Derby-Lewis's testimony will
continue today.

<HEADLINE> Prices Down in Major Chinese Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- July's retail prices and
consumer prices dropped by 0.9 percent and 1.1 percent,
respectively, over the June figures in 36 major Chinese cities,
the State Statistics Bureau (SSB) announced today.
</P>
<P>
In a survey report released today, the bureau attributes the
low inflation rate to the abundant supply of fresh fruit this
summer.
</P>
<P>
Only six of the 36 cities recorded an inflation rate of no more
than 1.2 percent, with the rest registering a moderate fall in
prices. The six cities with price hikes were Guangzhou, Shenzhen,
Nanning, Shanghai, Hangzhou and Ningbo.
</P>
<P>
According to the SSB report, the price drop continued for food
items, with the grain price going down 1.6 percent, fresh
vegetables down 5.2 percent, fresh fruit down 25.1 percent, and
eggs down 25.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The prices of manufactured goods also showed a minor decrease
over the numbers from June. Prices of clothes dropped by 0.7
percent, while household electrical appliances, communications
equipment, and entertainment, education and cultural utilities
went down by 0.4 percent, 0.2 percent and 0.4 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, the residents' consumer price index and the service
price index went up by 0.8 percent and 1.8 percent last month,
according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Moves to Check Unquarantined Maize Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has adopted stringent
measures at all border towns to avert the importation of
unquarantined maize into the country, Zambia Daily Mail reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The local paper quoted Watson Mwale, deputy director of the
Agriculture Ministry, as saying Monday that plant inspectors have
been posted at all border towns to ensure all maize imports into
the country are quarantined to avoid infested maize which could
prove to be deadly and costly to the country's food security.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to all maize traders to cooperate with the
ministry, warning that any infested grain will be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
It is important that Zambia contains plant diseases to
maintain its reputation on the export market because its exports
of non-traditional crops have been increased in recent years,
Mwale said.
</P>
<P>
In 1991/1992, some relief food imported by Zambia was infected
with a deadly larger grain borer. Now most of the country has
been infested with the insect pest.
</P>
<P>
This year, Zambia will suffer a shortfall of 450 million
kilograms in maize supplies because there was too much rainfall
during the last agricultural season.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Make Efforts for Afghan Reconciliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkey will accelerate its
efforts to mediate among rival parties of Afghanistan in a bid
to achieve a peaceful settlement in the war-torn country, a
Turkish government spokesman has said.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with local newspaper Daily News
published today, spokesman Ahad Andican said that Turkey is very
concerned about the situation in the country since a stable and
peaceful Afghanistan is of significant importance to this area.
</P>
<P>
"We will discuss the Afghan issue in the forthcoming
gathering of the Cabinet," Andican added.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the planned Pakistan-initiated Afghanistan peace
conference, Andican, also state minister, said that Turkey will
be actively involved in this U.N.-supervised conference.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the future of Afghan Uzbek militia commander
Rashid Dostum, who fled to Ankara following a military setback
in May, Andican said that Turkey's position on Afghanistan is
based on state interests instead of individuals.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Andican's remarks could be seen as
a change of Turkey's stance over the situation of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Dostum, who is currently on holiday in the Mediterranean city
of Antalya in southern Turkey, had long gained political,
financial and military support from Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government spokesman also played down Taliban's
role in the war-stricken nation, saying "the unexperienced
movement can do nothing in their struggle against the
opposition."
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan paid a three-day
visit to Turkey last week to discuss with Turkish leaders how to
find a peace solution to conflicts in the Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Domestic Investments Improving in Manufacturing in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Domestic investments are
improving as a result of greater industrial promotion and
increasing know-how and skills among Malaysians in the
manufacturing sector, Chairman of the Malaysian Industrial
Development Authority (MIDA) Zainal Abidin Sulong said today.
</P>
<P>
Malaysians have shown greater interest in investing their money
in the manufacturing sector, and domestic investments will
continue to improve from year to year, Zainal Abidin said.
</P>
<P>
As an industrial investment center under the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry (MITI), MIDA will watch the ratio
between the value of foreign and domestic investments closely, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, we want better participation by locals in the
manufacturing sector as manufacturing will always be the mainstay
and pillar of our economic growth," he added.
</P>
<P>
On measures taken by MIDA to improve and increase local
participation in manufacturing, Zainal Abidin said the Second
Industrial Master Plan (IMP2) for the period from 1996 to 2005 has
outlined very focused steps.
</P>
<P>
Under the IMP2, the setting up of the core Small and Medium
Industries Development Corporation was initiated in an effort to
attract more local small and medium industries (SMIs) to
manufacturing, he said.
</P>
<P>
Zainal Abidin said, "We have also identified the industrial
manufacturing clusters, especially for local SMIs to integrate and
work together towards the establishment of support industries, and
to produce substitute products for bigger local firms and foreign
multinational companies."
</P>
<P>
According to the official, in the past 10 years, foreign
investments constituted between 50 and 60 percent of the total
investments in Malaysia.

LHASA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Construction work on most of the
Tibet Museum has been completed at a cost of more than 100 million
yuan (12 million US dollars) in central government spending.
</P>
<P>
The museum is only one of 62 projects, mostly cultural,

development.
</P>
<P>
The museum has more than 100,000 pieces of historical relics,
the oldest of which date back to the Early Stone Age (500,000
years ago),
</P>
<P>
Tibet's first library, in Lhasa, which opened last year, ended
the region's long history of living without a library. Of the
590,000 volumes now housed in the library, 380,000 were donated by
some 500 publishing houses.
</P>
<P>
Nearly every county in the region now has a radio and
television station and radio and TV coverage has increased by 10
and 4 percentage points respectively.
</P>
<P>
In Lhasa's Xinhua Bookstore, the biggest in the region,
shoppers can find the latest best sellers pubished by publishing
houses in other parts of China. Xinhua has China's major chain of
bookstores.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Culture has collected three million yuan for 13
Aid-Tibet projects that include building cultural palaces and
training personnel. It also has 1.3 million yuan annually for the
region's cultural projects.
</P>
<P>
The State Bureau of Cultural Relics has also decided to help
cultural relics sites and buildings with fire-fighting facilities
and research on cultural relics in the region.

<HEADLINE> 210 Kenyans Arrested on August 8 Riot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- A total of 210 Kenyans have
been arrested and arraigned before courts following the killing
of two policemen during Friday's strike called by opposition
parties, the Kenya Times newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Among them, 137 have been charged with creating disturbance,
38 with incitement to violence, 22 with shop breaking and
looting, and four with arson, according to a statement issued by
police spokesman Peter Kimanthi.
</P>
<P>
"Following the killings, the police launched intensive
investigations as a result of which the suspects were arrested
and are being interrogated with a view to identifying the
killers," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Four members of the opposition National Development Party
(NDP) were arrested on Monday over the killing of a policeman in
Nairobi's Central Park.
</P>
<P>
The police arrested Tom Adinda on Thursday night. Adinda, who
is still in custody, is a personal aide of NDP leader Raila
Odinga.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Police Commissioner Duncan Wachira last week ordered a
nationwide crackdown on all forms of lawlessness and launched a
major man hunt for the killers of two police officers.

<HEADLINE> Chad Urged to Come Back to Correct Position on Relations with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- China today urged the Government
of Chad to stick to the principles enshrined in the communique on
the establishment of China-Chad relations and come back to the
correct position.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on Taiwan's restoring "diplomatic
relations" with Chad, Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang
warned that the Chinese Government would take "necessary
countermeasures."
</P>
<P>
While stepping up their pursuit for "two Chinas" or "one China,
one Taiwan", Shen said, the Taiwan authorities have practiced
"money diplomacy" and sought so-called "diplomatic recognition" by
taking advantage of the temporary economic difficulties of some
African countries.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese Government will make no compromise at all when it
comes to such issues of principle as state sovereignty and
national unity," the spokesman said, adding that China is
resolutely opposed "to any acts of the Taiwan authorities aimed at
splitting the motherland."
</P>
<P>
"We are also opposed to the development of official relations
of whatever form between countries having diplomatic relations
with us and Taiwan," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"We will never accept 'dual recognition'," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that the Government of Chad, on the issue of its
relations with China, "should adhere to the principles expounded
in the communique on the establishment of the diplomatic relations
between the two countries and come back to the correct position,
or it will face the necessary countermeasures by the Chinese
Government."

<HEADLINE> KANU Dismisses Calls for Constitutional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Kenya African
National Union (KANU) has strongly rejected calls by opposition
parties for a constitutional conference as opposed to the planned
dialogue, terming the move as "an effort in futility."
</P>
<P>
The move is intended to derail constitutional reform process
and the dialogue already in pipeline between the government and
the Opposition, KANU Secretary-General Joseph Kamotho was quoted
by today's Kenya Times as saying.
</P>
<P>
He was reacting to a statement by FORD-Asili Chairman Kenneth
Matiba calling for forming a technical team, comprising foreign
experts, to assist the church in holding a constitutional
conference in place of dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"What Matiba is doing is an effort in futility, trying to
preempt and derail the reform process already initiated by KANU,
the government and the churches," Kamotho said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, U.S. Ambassador to Kenya Prudence Bushnell
said she is surprised that the current trend being taken by
certain political leaders have completely failed to address the
political stalemate in the country.
</P>
<P>
"I have observed political leaders talk much about increasing
intransigent positions but act little on the citizen's voice,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
"A consensus on immediate reform and a longer term review of
constitutional reform must be vouched," she urged, noting the
lack of a level playing field as the general election is
approaching in this east African country.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ambassador did not mention the August 8 national
strike and Opposition demonstrations during which two policemen
were killed.

CHENGDU, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The foreign writers found
themselves surrounded by more than a thousand Chinese youngsters
in Chengdu, the capital of China's Sichuan Province, at a science
fiction festival.
</P>
<P>
The young sci-fi fans from large cities like Beijing, Xi'an,
and Shijiazhuang and from poor villages in Shaanxi and
Heilongjiang provinces queued up to get signatures from the five
American, Russian, and Japanese writers who came for the '97
International Science Fiction Summer Camp.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect so many young science fiction fans in China,
who have so much interest in high technology," said one American
science fiction writer who spoke on extraterrestrials, exceptional
qualities of human beings, flying saucers, and science fiction
movies.
</P>
<P>
A couple from a factory in Xi'an brought their son to Chengdu
just to satisfy the boy's desire to see spacemen.
</P>
<P>
The deputy editor-in-chief of Science Fiction World, a magazine
for young people, said that its circulation is now more than
230,000, and its fan club has more than 6,000 members.
</P>
<P>
The influence of science is beginning to outweigh that of film
and song stars among young people, resulting in the gratifying
situation where more Chinese children have become science fans
instead of movie or song star fans.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Seoul Mayor Cho Soon formally
declared today that he would run in the South Korean presidential
election in December, representing the minor Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Cho said that he had an obligation to serve the public in a
higher capacity and he would devote himself to running the city
until his resignation as Seoul mayor before September 19, the
deadline for candidates to resign from their official posts.
</P>
<P>
Cho apologized to the citizens of Seoul for resigning before
his tenure expires in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
The mayor, who was a professor at Seoul National University and
deputy primer minister in charge of economy, informed two days ago
that he would campaign for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
He would disclose information about his election preparation
later on, said Cho.
</P>
<P>
With Cho's bidding declaration, the presidential election,
which has originally been a fierce bout between Lee Hoi-chang of
the ruling New Korea Party and rival Kim Dae-jung and Kim
Jong-pil, is likely to be thrown into a new phase of disarray.

<HEADLINE> Call-Back Service Ruled Illegal in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The South African
Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (SATRA) has declared
call-back operations unlawful in South Africa, a local daily "The
Citizen" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The SATRA noted that it intended to enforce a crack-down on
such operations throughout the country from September this year.
</P>
<P>
SATRA chairman Nape Maepa was quoted as saying on Tuesday that
the ruling was in terms of the Telecommunications Act, 1996,
which states that services could only be provided by duly
licensed persons.
</P>
<P>
Call-back operations involve the use of cheaper foreign
telephone services by callers in South Africa, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The callers book international telephone calls with the
operator, mostly based in the United States of America. The
operator then calls back the South African subscriber and patches
him through to the party he wishes to talk to, by passing the
South African telephone network.
</P>
<P>
Maepa said Telkom, a state-owned telecommunication company,
was licensed to provide, among other services, international
telecommunications services on an exclusive basis for a fixed
period.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Telkom was reportedly losing about 30 million Rand
(about 6.7 million US Dollars) a year to call-back operations,
said Maepa.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that all call-back operators and their
customers should cease and desist from such unlawful activities,
as contravention of the act can result in serious punishment,
including two-year's imprisonment.

of Stockholm, where the 1912 Olympics were organized, was attacked
last Friday with explosives.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The French government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin will
reduce defense spending in its 1998 budget, while giving priority

programs, including the purchase of new Rafale combat aircraft,
will not be suspended.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Guangdong's Township Enterprises Maintain Steady Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Township enterprises in
China's more developed province of Guangdong reported a 22 percent
increase in output value in thee first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Their output value amounted to 260 billion yuan in output
value during that period.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the sector exported 70 billion yuan worth-of goods
and made 12.4 billion yuan in profits, rising by 26 percent and
12.5 percent, respectively, in the same period.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong has stepped up its efforts to create investment
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Huizhou City signed 192 contracts with partners at
home and abroad, involving 1.1 billion yuan, 918 million of which
came from overseas funding.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong also adopted a strategy to produce name-brand goods
made by township enterprises, aiming to push the sector to a
higher level of competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
And efforts have been made to promote agriculture-related
township businesses. In Shaoguan, more than 80 farm produce and
by-product centers have been built to promote the cultivation of
high-yield crops.
</P>
<P>
In the mountainous Meixian area, townships and villages have

<HEADLINE> Cameroun to Produce 1.5 Million Tons of Maize by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Cameroun is expected to produce
close to 1.5 million tons of maize by the year 2000, experts have
predicted.
</P>
<P>
The revelation was made by the experts attending a seminar on
cereal cultivation, preservation and commercialization which
ended here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The experts at the seminar noted that if projections are met,
Cameroun will become a non-negligible maize producer and
exporter.
</P>
<P>
The seminar participants reviewed that maize is the only
cereal crop that can be cultivated in all provinces of Cameroun.
It is also an important food item in most homes as well as a very
important input in agro-industries in the country.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the supply of maize in Cameroun is less than
the demand and that some 450,000 tons of maize are needed every
year to satisfy domestic and industrial needs.
</P>
<P>
But only 374,000 tons of maize are being produce in Cameroun.
So some 60,000 tons of maize are being imported into the country
from the United States and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The participants also noted that if the population are
properly informed, they can grow both the wheat and yellow
species of maize twice a year.
</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar was organized to create awareness on the
need to produce maize. Representatives of the Ministry of
Agriculture, international organizations, non-governmental
organizations and peasants associations attended the seminar.

<HEADLINE> Afforestation of Pearl River Area Progressing Smoothly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- China's effort to establish a
forest shelter belt along the Pearl River is progressing smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Forestry department officials in southwest China's Yunnan
Province, where the river originates, say that some 40,000 mu
(2,667 hectares) have been afforested. However, they point out,
the real afforestation area lies far beyond that.
</P>
<P>
China began to set up a shelter belt of trees along the river
in 1995, another of the country's large-scale ecological projects
similar to those in the north, along the Yangtze River and the
coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
Afforestation has begun in Yunnan, Guizhou and Guangdong
provinces and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, where more than
1.2 million hectares of trees are expected to be planted before
2050.
</P>
<P>
The project has a total investment of one billion yuan (about
125 million US dollars). Yunnan plans to spend 250 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Pearl River is the country's third longest river, with a
length of 2,241 km. Its river valley covers an area of 453,700
sq.km. and has a population of more than 70 million.
</P>
<P>
The river's annual shipping capacity ranks just after that of
the Yangtze River, making it an important line for inland water
transport and connecting the country's underdeveloped southwest
with developed Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
However, the ecological environment of the river valley is
deteriorating and soil erosion is becoming a serious problem.
Statistics show that the amount of eroded soil every year is equal
to more than 110,000 hectares of farmland.
</P>
<P>
The lower reaches of the river belong to the country's
developed areas, and the Pearl River Delta is China's important
agricultural base.
</P>
<P>
The ecological problem has aroused the attention of the Chinese
government, which has urged the four provinces in the valley to do
all they can to guarantee the region's sustainable development.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Benefit from World Bank-Financed Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- A once-barren valley called
Zijinshan in Pianguan County, Shanxi Province, is now covered with
lush greenery thanks to a World Bank-financed project.
</P>
<P>
Zijinshan is one of many places that have benefited from the
aid-the-poor project, which is centered on seven poor counties
along the Yellow River, spreading over an area of more than 5,000
sq km and targeting 440,000 people.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June, 100 million yuan had been spent in the
counties building 10,000 ha of terraced fields, 4,000 ha of fruit
plantations and more than 100 dams and dykes, planting trees on
10,000 ha.
</P>
<P>
The project, involving an investment of 530 million yuan, 37
million US dollars of which came from WB, expects to raise the
per-capita grain output to more than 500 kg, and the per-capita
income from 300 yuan to 800 yuan by the time it ends in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it will help raise the forestry coverage rate from 20
percent to 33 percent, and prevent six million tons of silt at the
Loess Plateau from shifting into the Yellow River annually.
</P>
<P>
In most of the project areas, farmers are beginning to lead a
better life and their grain output has more than doubled.

DALIAN, August 13 (Xinhua) -- China has made progress in
creating more green space in its cities, with the area of urban
green belts reaching 494,000 hectares and the greenery coverage
rate coming to 24.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that the country's public green belts

greenery area per capita stands at 5.3 sq.m..
</P>
<P>
Twelve cities, including Beijing and Dalian, report a greenery
coverage rate in excess of 45 percent. Their average urban
greenery area per capital is double that of the rest of the
country's.
</P>
<P>
East China's Shandong Province has 246 parks, over 150 more
than that six years ago. And northeast China's city of Dalian has
more than 20 parks.
</P>
<P>
The living environment of the Chinese people is improving, and
so is their quality of life, said Zhao Baojiang, deputy minister

<HEADLINE> 11-Year-Old Student Rescues Four Boys in Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- An 11-year-old primary school
student in a small village in Zhaotong City of southwest China's
Yunnan Province recently rescued four boys who accidentally fell
into a shallow pond.
</P>
<P>
On July 23, six-year-old Huang Nianqing slipped into a more
than two-meter-deep pond while walking to his home. The four other
boys who were with him jumped into the water holding hands to save
their friend.
</P>
<P>
They shouted for help, when they found that the water could
submerge their heads. Xu Shengyou, 11, who was bicycling past the
pond, jumped off his bike and dove into the water to save the boys.
</P>
<P>
He pushed four of the boys onto the bank before he got too
exhausted to rescue Huang, the first to fall into the water. Huang
was drowned.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Youth League of the region has praised Xu for his
heroism and encouraged him to aim high in life and study hard.
</P>
<P>
The story of the boy's brave deed has been spread throughout
the province by the mass media.

<P>
HAIKOU, August 13 (Xinhua) -- China's southernmost province of
Hainan has announced it will name the information industry as its
pillar industry, and will do more to provide resources for the
sector.
</P>
<P>
A public information network opened in Hainan last year, the
first of its kind in China, connected with Internet and China's
economic information network.
</P>
<P>
As tourism plays a crucial role in Hainan, an experimental
international tourism booking system has been set up to provide
services for tourists, linking information nets between travel
agencies and hotels in the province.
</P>
<P>
A basic information network now in place in the province
includes systems for financial nets, public safety monitoring and
land resources information.
</P>
<P>
Hainan's information industry got its start in 1993, when the
province computerized the financial accounting systems among five
banks and IC card networks.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong to Invest Heavily in Water Pollution Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Economically-developed
Guangdong Province in south China plans to spend 20 billion yuan
(2.4 billion US dollars) over the next 15 years to reduce water
pollution and improve the quality of its drinking water.
</P>
<P>
A plan known as the "Green Water Program" will spur
construction of more sewage treatment facilities and a water
quality monitoring network covering major rivers and lakes
throughout this populated province.
</P>
<P>
The program aims to ensure that 98 percent of drinking water
meets state standards and 90 percent of industrial sewage will be
treated by the year 2005. Meanwhile, the treatment rate of sewage
in urban areas will reach 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the coming five years, the province will build 52 sewage
disposal plants while completing industrial sewage disposal
projects at 31 companies that are big polluters, such as
paper-making plants and monosodium glutamate manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Harnessing projects targeting at 15 main rivers also are
scheduled to be completed.
</P>
<P>
Fast growth of industries and urbanization of rural areas in
recent years has led to serious pollution problems in most of the
rivers that span the province. Guangdong felt the urgency of
combating water pollution in order to achieve sustainable
development.
</P>
<P>
The extensive funding needed for the program will be raised
through different channels, according to the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
Part of the water-use fees, governmental allocations, and bank
and overseas loans will be used for the harnessing of rivers,
lakes and reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
Governments at different levels will be responsible for
supporting construction of their local sewage treatment
projects. Enterprises will pay for their own water disposal
facilities.

<P>
HOHHOT, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Beijing opera fans in Hohhot, the
capital of Inner Mongolia, were treated to their first opera
excerpts sung in Mongolian, when students from the Chifeng Art
School performed for them recently.
</P>
<P>
Students from the Inner Mongolian city of Chifeng performed
traditional Beijing opera excerpts from a story about a woman who
is treated wrongly during the Ming Dynasty, about 400 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Artists in the minority region have talked about performing
Inner Mongolian versions of Beijing opera for many years, but
translations of the libretti were almost impossible to do.
</P>
<P>
Without understanding the Beijing accent, most people have
difficulties in appreciating the "quintessence of the national art
form", local artists explain.
</P>
<P>
Chifeng has a large Mongolian population and student performers
in the city worked hard at rehearsals of the well-known Beijing
opera excerpts.
</P>
<P>
A young actor and an actress, 13 years of age, were praised by
critics for their successful performances.

<HEADLINE> Production Materials Market Remains Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- China's production materials
market remained stable in July, with sufficient supply, sluggish
demand, and prices going down.
</P>
<P>
According to the China Materials Information Center under the
Ministry of Internal Trade, of the 39 representative steel
products monitored, 25 recorded a drop in price in July compared
with the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry reported that in the
first six month of this year, the price of steel products for
construction dropped by one to three percent.
</P>
<P>
The sharp increase in production capacity and the output and
slowed demand forced producers to cut prices, triggering the
downturn in the market, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
As Chinese and overseas steel makers have been more actively
promoting their goods in coastal areas, the previously sharp
differences in steel prices have been eased between coastal areas,
where demand remains high, and the inland areas.
</P>
<P>
The steel market has also narrowed the gap between the
producer's price and the market price, a move initiated by
producers, analysts added.
</P>
<P>
The price of non-ferrous metals also continued to go down in
July, with the price of the five of the seven monitored products
falling, according to the center.
</P>
<P>
Of the chemicals, among the 39 monitored products, prices went
down for 27.
</P>
<P>
On the fuel market, prices of the coal and diesel oil fell
while that of petrol rose slightly.

<HEADLINE> New Stock Trading Accounts Surge in Chinese Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The number of new stock trading
accounts has surged in the Chinese capital since the start of this
month, though the market has been generally lukewarm.
</P>
<P>
Official data show that a total of 10,324 stock trading
accounts were opened during the five working days between August
4-8, or an average 2,064.8 new accounts each day, which was 78.8
percent more than the average daily number for July.
</P>
<P>
On August 9, a Saturday, 1,169 trading accounts were opened,
351 percent more than on August 2.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the surge in the number of new stock accounts
is largely due to an improving national economy and a drastic
decline in the minimum amount of money required for the opening of
trading accounts.
</P>
<P>
An improving macro economy, a sound development of the
financial sector and a surging stock index in Hong Kong have
combined to bolster investor confidence in the stock, they note.
</P>
<P>
As many stock operations have launched new services such as
accepting customers' telephone orders, the minimum amount of money
necessary for opening a stock trading account has dropped to next
to nothing from up to hundreds of thousands of yuan at the record
level.
</P>
<P>
The new telephone service has also enabled rural investors to
speculate in the stock market, analysts say. They expect the total
number of stock trading accounts in Beijing to reach at least one
million by the end of 1997, and hopefully to hit 1.1 million.

<HEADLINE> US Envoy Extends Mediation Visit After Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross
is extending his stay here today following his success in
persuading the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to agree to
renew full security cooperation with Israel.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Arafat Tuesday night, Arafat revealed
"the good news" of agreeing to full security cooperation with
Israel, which prompted Ross to delay his scheduled departure for
a day.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Palestinian and Israeli security
officials will hold meetings periodically and exchange
intelligence on fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Ross held the fourth round of talks Tuesday with Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem and PNA President
Yasser Arafat in Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
PNA Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Nabil
Sha'ath, who attended the Ross-Arafat meeting, said that
"Palestinians agreed to resume full security coordination, but
prefer that the American side will be a witness."
</P>
<P>
He said that the PNA will "try to persuade" Israel to accept a
permanent U.S. role in the Israeli-Palestinian security
coordination.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's media adviser Abu Rudeineh said that he would not
describe the Tuesday meeting as a breakthrough, but hoped the
breakthrough will come in today's meetings.
</P>
<P>
He was apparently referring to the fact that Ross had not yet
succeeded in persuading Israel to lift the sanctions imposed on
the Palestinians following last month's suicide bombings in
Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market, which killed 15 people and
wounded 170 others.
</P>
<P>
Ross is to meet with Netanyahu today again in a bid to
consolidate the initial results from his shuttle mission by
persuading Israel to lift sanctions against the Palestinians,
including a total closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip and the
halt of tax revenues to the PNA.
</P>
<P>
While welcoming Ross' reported success in obtaining Arafat's
promise on renewing full security coordination, Israel remained
skeptical about the real results.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with the British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC) television, Netanyahu stressed that holding
meetings were not enough and he was still unsatisfied with the
level of security cooperation at this stage.
</P>
<P>
"So what we expect him (Arafat) to do and what the U.S. is
expecting him to do is to fight terrorism, not only for our
sake, but for his sake, and for the sake of peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is demanding the PNA imprison leaders of militant
organizations and terrorist suspects liable to carry out
anti-Israeli attacks and crack down on their infrastructure. The
Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), a leading anti-Israeli
militant organization, claimed responsibility for the Jerusalem
bombings, but the claim has not been verified.
</P>
<P>
Ross' success in renewing the Israeli-Palestinian security
cooperation will pave the way for a much-expected first visit by
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to this region to
promote the peace process before the end of this month.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from more than
40 of China's major international tourism agencies recently
gathered in Shanghai to discuss strategies for increasing their
share of the expanding domestic tourism market.
</P>
<P>
The participants, coming from agencies in east China and remote
Yunnan, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia, agreed that domestic tourism
is gaining unprecedented momentum.
</P>
<P>
With years' of successful experiencing in dealing with overseas
tourists, these agencies can help improve the general level of
China's tourism industry by actively promoting domestic tourism
programs, the representatives maintained.
</P>
<P>
While China's international tourism effort has made remarkable
progress, even according to world standards, the domestic tourism
industry has also boomed: 639 million Chinese people traveling
across the country in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Many international travel agencies are now catering to both
international and domestic tourists. For example, the Shanghai
International Travel Service, one of the largest in the country,
was cited as one of the 50 largest domestic tourism organizations
in China in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, the agency received over 12,000
domestic tourists, with business turnover topping 4.6 million yuan
(554,200 US dollars).

SHANGHAI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- More and more urban Chinese are
traveling on their holidays and days off, with some even basking
on foreign beaches.
</P>
<P>
As Chinese people's wallets thicken, a growing number of city
dwellers are choosing faraway outings over the usual pasttimes of
sleeping or playing cards at home.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent survey by Horizon Market Survey and

cities surveyed for tourism preferences, Guangzhou topped the list
in terms of the proportion of residents who travel, with 35.6
percent taking trips regularly. The figure is ten percentage
points higher than Beijing's.
</P>
<P>
Sources from local travel agencies said that urban Chinese
favor two or three-day journeys to neighboring cities or nearby
resorts.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai residents enjoy the mountains and lakes in adjacent
Zhejiang Province, famous for its West Lake resort and other
distinctive small towns near rivers and lakes.
</P>
<P>
The landscape of the Three Gorges on the Yangtze River and
varieties of local cuisine in Chengdu, the capital of southwest
China's Sichuan Province, have attracted the interest of Chongqing
residents.
</P>
<P>
Two-day weekends have given Chinese urbanites more spare time
to spend with their family and friends. Two years ago, they could
only enjoy one-day weekend.
</P>
<P>
In addition, elderly people in cities are showing more interest
in taking trips. About 34 percent of elderly residents between 56

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria to Privatize Four More Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Bulgarian government plans to
privatize four more state-owned banks by the end of 1997, a senior
finance official said.
</P>
<P>
The banks to be privatized include the Biochim, the Hebrosbank,
the Bulgarian Post Bank and the Expressbank.
</P>
<P>
Once that is completed, the government will prepare for the
sale of the Bulbank, the country's biggest state-run foreign trade
bank, said Peter Zhotev, the newly-named executive director of the
Bank Consolidation Company (BCC) and the de facto owner of the
country's state-run banks.
</P>
<P>
The wave of Bulgaria's banking privatization started with the
sale of the United Bulgarian Bank (UBB), one of the Balkan
country's biggest state-owned banks, about one month ago.
</P>
<P>
The BCC reportedly sold the UBB shares at 26 percent of their
face value.
</P>
<P>
Banking privatization in Bulgaria does not seek to ensure
sizable cash proceeds but to improve management of the banks and
reduce the risk in the financial system, Deputy Prime Minister
Aleksander Bozhkov said.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the sale of UBB, Zhotev, a strong supporter for
a transparent and speedy privatization of Bulgarian banks, was
named BCC's new executive director.
</P>
<P>
Following the sale of UBB, some financiers began to consider
the possibility for the participation of the Privatization Agency
in the process of denationalization of banks.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhotev argued that only the BCC has the right to sell
its stakes in the state-run banks to private and foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
The BCC is able to carry out privatization of banks smoothly,
and the participation of the Privatization Agency at this stage is
neither necessary nor legally provided for, Executive Director of
the Privatization Agency Alexander Subotinov said.
</P>
<P>
Subotinov also confirmed that a 1994 proposal for the agency's
involvement in the process has not yet been accepted.
</P>
<P>
Former central bank under-governor Mileti Mladenov agreed that
banking privatization must be carried out by the BCC because this
is the the company's sole and key function.
</P>
<P>
He said the privatization of banks is important insofar as it
could provide fresh money for normal banking activity.
</P>
<P>
"If state-run Bulgarian banks are sold to foreign investors by
the mid-1998, we shall be able to say that we have made up for the
delay in banking privatization," Mladenov said.

<HEADLINE> Time Not Come for Internationalizing Refugee Issue: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Time has not come yet for
internationalizing the Bhutanese refugee issue, but India's
cooperation is desirable, Nepali Foreign Minister Kamal Thapa
said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that Nepal and Bhutan can solve the issue through
dialog, the time has not yet arrived to internationalize the
issue," said Thapa Tuesday when answering queries in the Lower
House.
</P>
<P>
He said since the refugees had to travel through India to enter
and leave Nepal, Nepal has been anticipating full cooperation from
the Indian government, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the recent visit to Bhutan by the foreign
secretary, Thapa said the Bhutanese government has given its
assurance of early reply to suggestions by Nepal, but "it is not
yet time to be jubilant."
</P>
<P>
Nepal and Bhutan have held seven rounds of ministerial-level
talks about the 100,000 Bhutanese refugees, who have been staying
in eastern Nepal in eight UN-run camps after being forced to flee
Bhutan in 1989 and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Nepal maintained that all the refugees should be repatriated
while Bhutan only agreed to take back those it considered to be
genuine Bhutanese citizens.
</P>
<P>
As most of the refugees are of Nepalese origin, the two
Himalayan kingdoms differ on how to identify them.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has urged India, who handles Bhutan's foreign and defense
affairs, to help solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
But India replied that this problem is a bilateral one between
Nepal and Bhutan.
</P>
<P>
Many commentators in Nepal have said the internationalization
of the issue is the only way out.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Challenges U.S. Anti-Dumping Charges on Chips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 13 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will file a formal
complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO) today to
challenge the United States' anti-dumping measures on South Korean
DRAM chips.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time South Korea has taken the U.S. to the
WTO for bilateral consultations. On July 10, the U.S. imposed
anti-dumping duties on South Korea-made color TV sets.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Trade and Industry said it will ask the U.S. to
hold bilateral consultations on the DRAM chip issue today.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. has not revoked its anti-dumping measures even after
the Department of Commerce ruled that two South Korean companies
had not dumped or imposed minimal dumping margins on their DRAM
chips," a ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
Despite insignificant dumping margins, the U.S. Department of
Commerce ruled on July 16 to maintain the anti-dumping measures
imposed since May 1993. They claimed the two Korean companies
failed to prove they would not dump their semiconductors again.
</P>
<P>
"Its anti-dumping decision -- for that reason -- violates WTO
agreements," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Should consultations fail to produce a compromise, South Korea
has the option of requesting the formation of a panel to settle
the dispute. The panel's ruling is binding and related-parties are
obligated to accept it as law, the officials said.

<HEADLINE> India to Tighten Entry Norms for New Credit Rating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Securities and Exchange
Board of India (SEBI) is considering a proposal to tighten the
entry barriers for new credit rating agencies to enable the market
watch body to keep a close tab on them, SEBI sources said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at not making credit rating into a business
where one agency would be competing the other to lure more
business. Credit rating should be aimed at helping investors
rather than agencies to do business, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, India has four credit rating agencies. It is
better to have only a few credit rating agencies to compete
against each other. Having more players is bad to the industry as
well as to the investors, the same sources said.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines will make credit rating more of a scientific and
mechanical work, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Act Against Proselytism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali Ministry of Health
is preparing to act strongly against the Adventist Development and
Relief Agency (ADRA) for its alleged role in proselytizing, the
daily Kathmandu Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has stated that the agreement with the ADRA will
be terminated if it does not follow the suggestions forwarded by a
Nepali committee.
</P>
<P>
The committee, charged with investigating the ADRA's alleged
illegal activities, has advised the ADRA to remain within the
limits of the agreement and not hire foreigners, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The ADRA, an international non-governmental organization who
entered Nepal a few years ago, is supposed to provide health and
educational services.
</P>
<P>
But it has been accused of bringing in foreigners to spread
Christianity in Nepal without the knowledge of the government.
</P>
<P>
It has also been preaching Christianity in Tibet and Bhutan
using Nepal as its base, evidences show.
</P>
<P>
A report forwarded by the Nepali committee asked the Health
Ministry to inform the Ministries of Education, Home Affairs and
Local Development about the undesirable activities of the ADRA.
</P>
<P>
The committee suggested that the ADRA be stopped from running
the Adventist School in Dhulikhel, about 45 kilometers southeast
of Kathmandu, and that all the staffs employed by them be sacked.
</P>
<P>
The ADRA had brought a unit of Adventist World Radio to Nepal
under the government privileges.
</P>
<P>
The committee advised the USAID, which fund the ADRA's
programs, to check whether its funds are being used in a proper
manner.
</P>
<P>
The Kathmandu-based World Hindu Federation has threatened to
take the matter to the International Court of Justice if it is not
satisfied with the actions of the ADRA and the government.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
launched a water rehabilitation program to improve farm irrigation
with foreign aid, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The program includes the building of smaller tanks near hill
slopes to store the water of untapped streams and convey it to
fields through a network of pipes for irrigation.
</P>
<P>
It also aims to increase the capacity of existing large tanks
by cleaning up the rivers, streams and canals feeding them.
</P>
<P>
All small tanks in a neglected state will be repaired and the
existing system of agricultural wells in the dry zones will be
widened.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said there are nearly 100 small tanks in a
neglected state and these tanks, if rehabilitated, will be able to
serve 15 acres of paddy land each.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has around 2.2 million acres of paddy land but nearly
half of this is fallow now due to shortage of water.
</P>
<P>
The water rehabilitation program will help the country achieve
its target in rice production, the sources added.

to a national family health survey, remains high at 28.9 percent.
There is concern that if the fertility rates are not brought down
dramatically, all development programs would suffer. The
population of the country is more than double what it was at the
time of independence in 1947 despite measures taken and crores of
rupees spent so far.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The State Council recently
issued a notice to expand the 15-article "State Poverty Relief
Fund Management Measures" which went into effect on August 1.
</P>
<P>
The measures, worked out by the Leading Group in Charge of
Aid-the-poor Projects under the State Council, are meant to
stretch the limited poverty relief fund so that the poor people in
rural areas have sufficient food and clothing and the economies of
poverty-stricken areas are developed.
</P>
<P>
The fund comes mainly from the central government and state
loans. It can only be used in the State-designated poor counties
to improve agricultural production conditions, develop diversified
businesses, build roads, create educational opportunities and wipe
out illiteracy, and provide drinking water, according to the new
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
Local governments are required to increase spending on poverty
alleviation, with local support going to the State-recognized poor
counties accounting for 30-50 percent of the State-allocated
capital.
</P>
<P>
Any province that fails to pay its proportion will suffer from
a fund deduction the following year, and in the event funds are
misappropriated, the money will be recovered and the people
involved will be punished, according to the rules.

<HEADLINE> China's Mobile Phone Subscribers To Triple by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- A senior telecommunications
official predicted yesterday that China's mobile phone subscribers
will exceed 30 million by 2000, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based newspaper quotes Yuan Mingfu, deputy director
of the Mobile Communications Bureau under the Ministry of Posts
and Telecoms (MPT), as saying that the Chinese mobile phone market
has great potential, and market planning could not catch up with
the tremendous growth of the market.
</P>
<P>
Yuan's prediction is based on the fact that by mid-July this
year, China had over ten million mobile phone subscribers, the
world's third largest mobile phone population after the United
States and Japan. In the first half of this year, China registered
nearly 2.9 million new users.
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, the total number of mobile phone subscribers in
China has grown on average by 160 percent a year, one of the
highest rates in the world.
</P>
<P>
The world's major telecoms giants have their eyes fixed firmly
on China and are competing fiercely for a bigger market share. In
recent years, demand has been so great that telecoms companies
have never had to worry that their mobile phone switching
capacities would be excessive.
</P>
<P>
In China, there are now 0.8 mobile phones per 100 people, which
reflects the huge potential of China's mobile phone market in the
future, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Peasants, Indians Hold General Protest in Ecuador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A general protest by Ecuadoran
peasants and Indians starting Monday will last 72 hours and could
be further extended if the government ignores their demands of
abolishing privatization of social security system for peasants.
</P>
<P>
Up to 12 provinces of the country's 21 provinces and three
regions are joining the strike, which is aimed to force the
National Assembly to meet in October and attack the privatization
of social security system for peasants.
</P>
<P>
Protesters demand Social Security Minister Gonzalo Baquero
Paret to resign and the government to pay its debt to the Ecuador
Institute of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
According to government official Cesar Verduga, some 4,000
protesters are rallying by roads. He warned that the Assembly will
not discuss the peasant issue so long as the rallies continue.
</P>
<P>
The government has already closed schools in the coastal area
for fear of possible rash actions from the protesters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Administration Secretariat Arturo Gangotena said the
government is ready for talks with the protesters, and urged them
to return to work.
</P>
<P>
However, Head of the Peasants Movement, Macias Ushina, turned
down the request, saying "We will continue fighting".
</P>
<P>
Ushina also condemned the government repression of Indians and
peasants, which he said takes place all over the country now.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Rupiah Plunges by 40 Points </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's currency of rupiah
decreased Tuesday by 40 points against the U.S. dollar, but
Jakarta share prices increased slightly in a technical rebound,
local press today quoted analysts as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian currency began at 2,610 rupiah per dollar,
dropped until 2,650 at noon, and closed at 2,638.
</P>
<P>
The closing figure passed the normal exchange equilibrium set
up by Bank Indonesia between 2,555 rupiah and 2,610 rupiah.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange dealers said the further weakening of the
rupiah was triggered by falls in the Singapore dollar and
Malaysian ringgit.
</P>
<P>
However, Coordinating Minister for Economic and Development
Supervision Saleh Affif said Tuesday that the rupiah fluctuation
was still normal. "We have not need to intervene and we do not yet
plan to enlarge its spread."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, share prices on the Jakarta stock exchange rose 0.7
percent, with composite index closing 4.77 points firmer to 662.94
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Securities analysts said Tuesday's rise in stock prices was
just a technical bounce after a sharp plunge in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
Sources at Bank Indonesia predicted that the rupiah and other
currencies of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)
countries are expected to return to normal after the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) moved to help stabilizing the Thai baht.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia helps the stabilization program by giving 500 million
U.S. dollars to Thailand through the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah fluctuation began on July 11 after Bank Indonesia
enlarged spread of rupiah exchange rate from 8 percent to 12
percent. The lowest plunge took place on July 21 when the rupiah
dropped to 2,660 per U.S. dollars.

MOSCOW, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Civil Aviation Administration of
Russia (CAAR) has decided to take steps to improve flight safety
and reduce costs, the Itar-Tass news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a working conference, CAAR Vice Director Ivan Varon
pointed out the CAAR's passenger safety rate declined
significantly in the first half of this year, with accidents
numbering 1.7 times, and death toll, 1.9 times, that of the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Survey results indicate that 78 percent of the accidents were
caused by human factors such as mis-arranged flights and poor
maintenance work, Varon said.

<P>
Over the same period, the number of passengers carried by CAAR
dropped by 13 percent while its operational costs went up, with
more enterprises under CAAR going deeper in the red and damage to
its fixed assets standing at 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, CAAR has decided to reform its mechanism and
legislate regulations to boost its all-around performance in the

<HEADLINE> Italian Troops to Help Albania Rebuild Armed Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Italy and Albania are discussing
plans to deploy an Italian force to assist Albania in rebuilding
its shattered armed forces, Italy's ANSA news agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Since a relevant political accord on the establishment and
deployment of the Italian force has already been signed in Tirana,
defense ministry representatives from both countries are
negotiating technical issues concerning the deployment, ANSA said.
</P>
<P>
The Italian force will reportedly consist of 400 to 450 army
troops and 200 naval troops, which will be based in Tirana and
Durres on the Adriatic Sea.
</P>
<P>
Entrusted with the mission to rebuild the Albanian army, the
Italian force is expected to enter Albania by the end of August
and will be stationed there for a period of no less than five
months.
</P>
<P>
The deployment of the force is included in an agreement between
the Italian and Albanian governments, and has nothing to do with
the United Nations, ANSA said.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 Albanians were killed during nationwide unrest
caused by the collapse of a fraudulent investment scheme early
this year. It was reported that nearly every Albanian family lost
money in the scheme.
</P>
<P>
An Italian-led multinational force nearly 7,000-strong, which
was deployed in Albania under a U.N. mandate in April to secure
aid deliveries, is gradually being withdrawn. All the troops of
the multinational force are expected to pull out of the tiny
nation in August.

MANAGUA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Central America and the
Caribbean countries economy growth slows down in 1996, according to
a statement released today by the Economic Commission for Latin
America and the Caribbean (CEPAL).
</P>
<P>
"In 1996 the region gross domestic product (GDP) rose 2.3
percent down from 4.4 percent increase a year earlier. The product
per capita fell in a stalemate after four years of major rises",
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It underlined that "the economy growth rate suffered a
recession at the same time in the central American Isthmus
countries."
</P>

The commission attributed the recession to the slump of exports
of coffee, banana and major grain crops.
</P>
<P>
The commission predicted a modest improvement in
economic growth and a better agriculture, along
with success of inflation-controlling programs adopted by the
countries in the region.

<P>
Post-devaluation estimates by the government showed that the
economy, as measured by the gross national product (GNP), would
grow by only 6.64 percent for 1997, slower than the original
projection of 7 to 8 percent, according to the Philippine daily
Inquirer.
</P>
<P>
The estimates also showed that expansion of the gross domestic
product (GDP) would shrink by 0.46 percentage points to 5.43
percent from the programmed level of 5.89 percent.
</P>
<P>
As of June this year, the country's economic managers were
projecting the economy to expand by 7.03 percent for the current
year. This was the lower end of the growth range expected by the
government.
</P>
<P>
The growth, however, had been lowered by 0.39 percentage points
to 6.64 percent under the revised projections that were drawn up
to take in the effects of the devaluation of peso on July 11 when
monetary authorities allowed the peso to trade within a wider
range.
</P>
<P>
The revised growth target of 6.64 percent for this year assumed
that the peso would depreciate by 6.06 percent from 26.40 to 28 to
a dollar this year, the Inquirer said.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine to Lower Death Rate, Improve Pharmacy Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A lower death rate and an improved
pharmacy industry would be the government's health policy
priorities, Ukrainian Prime Minister Valeriy Pustovoitenko said
today.
</P>
<P>
The government must do a good job in people's health care for
human resources are the most valuable wealth of a nation,
Pustovoitenko said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the average number of deaths each year in
Ukraine, a country with a population of 51.3 million, is about
800,000, while that for birth is 470,000.
</P>
<P>
Pustovoitenko attributed the growing death and decreasing birth
rates to low family income level caused by poor financial
situation.
</P>
<P>
Noting that tuberculosis (TB) is one of the major killers
threatening the Ukrainians, Pustovoitenko also urged
pharmaceutical factories to support the government's plan to
prevent and control TB by making more effective drugs.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that 1 million Ukrainians are suffering
from TB, a disease that killed 8,200 in 1996 alone.

<HEADLINE> Zhangjiajie Takes Action on Ecology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 13 (Xinhua) -- The local government of
Zhangjiajie, in central China's Hunan Province, has devoted great
attention to the protection of the environment while developing
tourism in the country's famous forest park.
</P>
<P>
Their goal for the millennium is to bid farewell to chimneys,
and keep the mountains greener and the sky bluer, said today's
"China Daily."
</P>
<P>
A special regulation on environmental protection issued by the
People's Government of Hunan Province's Zhangjiajie City
stipulates that the control of air pollution and the quality of
drinking water in the city must meet the first-class standards
laid down by the State, which are higher than the national average.
</P>
<P>
In the next three years, the city's coal-fired boilers must be
replaced with oil, gas or electric boilers in order to reduce
noxious emissions.
</P>
<P>
This year, the local government closed five factories,
including two paper mills and a cement plant, which produced large
amounts of pollutants, said Ren Chaodong, vice-mayor of the city.
</P>
<P>
Ren said that the development of the tourist industry meant the
environment could not be sacrificed for the sake of economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Located 400 km. northwest of provincial capital Changsha,
Zhangjiajie has a history that is synonymous with the development
of tourism.
</P>
<P>
The national forest park, covering 369 sq.km., boasts rich
tourism resources in a splendid natural environment.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, it has hosted more than 1.2 million
tourists from home and abroad each year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of next year, another two million tourists are
expected, including 20,000 overseas travelers, and tourism revenue
is expected to reach about 800 million yuan (96 million
U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> The Biggest and the Best Family in Hungary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Hungarian government's plea
for families to have more children has, for the most part, fallen
on deaf ears.
</P>
<P>
Although most couples in the country feel a need to practice a
form of austerity in the number of their family member and are
reluctant to go along with the government's idea, there is one
family that anticipated the call more than 30 years ago and
responded accordingly.
</P>
<P>
Lukacs Erno and his wife Csath Julianna are the exception.
</P>
<P>
Living on a farm near the Danube, Lukacs, 54, and Csath, 53,
now have the biggest family in Hungary and probably in all of
Europe.
</P>
<P>
"I have always loved children," said the proud and prolific
father. "So when we got married in 1965, I told my wife that she
should give me 10 children."
</P>
<P>
Though his wife agreed, the actual number of children she had
in mind was considerably smaller.
</P>
<P>
"Why not have more?" she asked, jokingly.
</P>
<P>
And they did have more. In the past 32 years, the couple have
given birth to six sons and 14 daughters, including a pair of
twins. Their oldest children have children of their own, while the
youngest is only seven years old and recently started elementary
school.
</P>
<P>
The family farm in southern Hungary covers 300 hectares. Having
a large number of children in the family has proven to be a
distinct advantage. While Lukacs and his sons take care of the
hard labor in the field, his wife and daughters take care of the
housework and raise livestock.
</P>
<P>
"There has never been a quarrel in our family, and we are all
very close," said the smiling couple.
</P>
<P>
During holidays and other special occasions, such as the
birthday of a family member, the entire family gathers
together. And with the arrival of the married sons and
daughters-in-law, and the seven grandchildren, the number of
people attending these "small" family parties can easily jump to
37.
</P>
<P>
And for Lukacs and Csath, it is certainly, "The more, the
merrier."
</P>
<P>
"This is just what I have always wanted," says Lukacs, "And I
love the atmosphere."

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian soccer fans
planted a bomb which exploded at the headquarters of Rio club
Flamengo on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A group of angry fans claimed responsibility for the explosion
at a meeting roon of the club.
</P>
<P>
Some windows were smashed and curtains were set on fire but
damage appeared to be minimal.
</P>
<P>
Kleber Leite, who took over as president at the start of 1995,
has faced increasing opposition from the fans as he failed to
produce a decent team.
</P>
<P>
The club, which claims to be the best supported in the country,
is currently 22nd in the 26-team championship.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 players have been bought and sold in the Leite era
and he has employed six coaches.
</P>
<P>
During one three-month period last year, Flamengo signed Bebeto
and sold Romario to Spanish Valencia, resold Bebeto and brought
Romario back on loan. Yet, the club has not scored a goal in the
championship since Romario's loan expired last month.
</P>
<P>
The latest storm was triggered off following reports that Leite
wanted to replace coach Sebastiao Rocha with Paulo Autuori from
Cruzeiro.

HARARE, August 12 (Xinhua) -- South Africa topped the standings
table by gunning down New Zealand 6-4 in the final of the women's

on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Both South Africa and New Zealand have already qualified for

The top six teams, which also bracket Scotland, India, England

</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Wang Qingsen said that the competition level of
the tournament had gone beyond his expectations.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese women's team used to have an edge over its opponents
as far as speed was concerned, now fastness has become the trend
in the game and the Chinese advantages have faded away," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang also referred to the high altitude of Harare as partly
accountable for the "undesirable outcomes" of the Chinese team
which registered a 2-1-2 tournament record.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Cape Town Olympic
Bidding Committee got a morale-boosting gesture as visiting
delegates from the International Olympic Committee openly voiced
their support on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
President Nelson Mandela won the vocal support when he received
IOC delegates from Turkey, Uganda, Germany and Mauritius, the
latest group to visit South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Delegates usually are reticent to state opinions, but both
Turkey and Mauritius echoed Mandela's standard line that the Games
should come to Africa, the only "ring" in the Olympic five-ring
logo not to host the quadrennial event.
</P>
<P>
"We must complete the five rings in the logo if we believe in
the universality of the Games," said Turkish delegate Sinan Erdem.
</P>
<P>
Mauritius delegate Ram Ruhee added: "For the universality of
the Olympic games, it has to go to South Africa. Further than
that, you have a impressive big and a beautiful city and a great
constitution showing democracy."
</P>
<P>
Being one of the five finalists, Cape Town is the only bidding
city from Africa, the continent that still awaits the first
Olympic Games. The other candidates are Athens, Rome, Stockholm
and Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
The IOC members will cast their votes on September 5 for the
eventual host.

<HEADLINE> Economists Lift Projections for U.S. Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Conference Board, a New
York-based research group, projected the U.S. economic growth for
1998 at 3 percent, almost a percentage point higher than forecast
in May.
</P>
<P>
The researchers made little prospect of a slowdown until late
1998 or 1999.
</P>
<P>
"There is simply no sign of an interim cycle peak in activity,"
said Gail D. Fosler, senior vice president and chief economist of
the Conference Board. "The key indicators -- inventories, bond
yields, exports and the index of leading indicators -- are all
favorable. And consumer fundamentals remain hugely positive,
especially home-related purchases."
</P>
<P>
The economy will reaccelerate in the second half of 1997, with
another bout of 4 percent growth likely at the end of 1997 and the
beginning of 1998. Overall, the U.S. economy will grow 3.5 percent
this year and another 3 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending will rise to 3.1 percent in 1998 from 2.7
percent this year and the unemployment rate will fall to 4.6
percent in 1998 from 5 percent in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Dow Plunges Below 8,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August (Xinhua) -- Stocks dropped sharply in the
final hour of trading today after bond yields shot higher on
concerns of building inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 101.27 points to
7,960.84. It closed below 8,000 for the first time since July 21.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with NYSE volume reaching 498.89
million shares as against 480.34 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
Broad-market indexes were lower along with the Dow.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 10.47 to 926.53, and
the NYSE composite index fell 4.45 to 480.76.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 10.29 to 1,576.45, and the
American Stock Exchange composite index fell 1.12 to 643.23.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year Treasury bond was down 7-16 point, pushing its
yield, which rises when prices fall, to 6.68 percent from 6.63
percent late Monday. Bonds fell after a private report this
afternoon suggested retail sales were strong in August.
</P>
<P>
Banking stocks were firm for most of the session but gave
ground in the final hour as interest rates moved higher.
