WALTER ADAMS, 78, EXPERT ON CORPORATE POWER AND ANTITRUST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 ((Subs lead graf to correct date of death)   (bl)

<P>
   Dr. Walter Adams, an antitrust expert whose concerns about
concentrations of corporate power helped shape government policy
for three decades, died Tuesday at his home in East Lansing, Mich.,
according to a statement from Michigan State University, where he
taught for 46 years. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   His son, William James Adams of Ann Arbor, Mich., said the cause
was pancreatic cancer. Professor Adams learned in May that he had
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Adams taught economics at Michigan State from 1947 to
1993 and served as president of the university for nine months in
1969, a time when antiwar and civil rights protests rocked the
campus. He addressed those issues with such candor and good humor
that more than 20,000 students and 950 faculty members signed a
petition asking him to stay on as president. But he said he wanted
to teach, not be an administrator.
</P>
<P>
   John Kenneth Galbraith, the Harvard University economist,
praised Adams as a ``wonderful teacher'' who was ``a good New Deal
liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   He served on a federal committee that Attorney General Herbert
Brownell formed in 1953 to study antitrust laws, and he spent many
summers in Washington volunteering his expertise to congressional
committees in an era when they had little or no staff.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote or co-wrote 14 books warning of the dangers of
concentrated economic power, including ``The Bigness Complex'' in
1987 and ``Dangerous Pursuits: Mergers &AMP; Acquisitions in the Age of
Wall Street'' in 1989, both with Prof. James W. Brock of Miami
University of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``He raised enduring questions of power and control in economics
and in the closely related political arena as well,'' Brock said.
``He kept alive a concern about excessive concentration of power
and its dangers to a free society because it undermines good
economic performance, retards innovation and tends to spread into
the political sphere in lobbying aimed at creating anti-competitive
public policies. He taught that we can't rest easy in the delusion
that the unfettered free market will take care of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams was sharply critical of the Reagan administration for
allowing big corporate mergers. In 1988 he wrote that ``the
antitrust laws have been subjected to a systematic policy of
euthanasia.''
</P>
<P>
   But William Baxter, a Stanford University law professor who was
the Reagan administration's antitrust chief for three years, said
concern about industries in which a handful of companies can set
``administered prices'' and operate insulated from supply and
demand ``has gone from the predominant point of view to an
idiosyncratic point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Judge Robert Bork, who is an antitrust expert and several
times jousted with Adams, said ``he saw concentration of industries
everywhere and tended to think that industries I would think were
perfectly competitively structured were not competitively
structured.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Adams was born in 1922 in Vienna. His family moved to
Brooklyn in 1935. He graduated magna cum laude from Brooklyn
College in 1942 with an economics degree and also studied at the
University of Chicago. He earned his doctorate at Yale University
in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II he served in the 83rd Infantry Division,
fighting in the Battle of the Bulge, and in the 11th Armored
Division. He received a battlefield commission as a lieutenant and
the Bronze Star. He often described his war experiences as ``the
Tour de France sans bicyclette.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams' playful side showed in an otherwise dry report in 1963
for the Senate Antitrust and Monopoly subcommittee on oligopolies.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lanzillotti, who was then the economics chairman at
Michigan State and co-author of the report, said, ``We wanted to
deal with those economists who saw no merit in the theory of
administered prices and who frequently supported their position by
citing research that their graduate students were doing but that
was not complete or published.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams added a footnote on a study of the relationship of prices
and profits by Hubertus von und Swickenstein and Boris
Przmysy-Watson. Though the names were fictitious and the ruse had
been reported, other researchers asked him how to get in touch with
the pair.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son, he is survived by his wife, Pauline, and
two grandsons.
</P>
<P>
   His last book, ``The Tobacco Wars,'' written with Professor
Brock, was published last week by South-Western College Publishing
of Cincinnati. It was their third book to use the form of a play to
teach economics.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, after word of Adams' illness became known around
the Michigan State campus, more than 200 musicians in the college
marching band, which he had supported for a half-century, came to
his home to play the university fight song and alma mater for him.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Congress prepared on Thursday to make public the
445-page impeachment report by the Whitewater independent counsel,
Democrats and Republicans began testily jockeying over the details
of disclosing materials that could imperil the Clinton presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Despite repeated references to bipartisanship by leaders of both
parties, feuding erupted as Republicans rebuffed efforts by
Democrats to win even one hour in advance of the report's release
for the president and his lawyers to review it.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, in a party-line vote, the Republican-controlled
House Rules Committee defeated a Democratic effort to give Clinton
48 hours to see the charges against him. By voice vote, it then
sent to the full House a resolution to allow immediate
dissemination of the report by the Whitewater independent counsel,
Kenneth Starr, concerning the president's extramarital relationship
with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The House was expected to easily pass the measure on Friday, a
vote that will pave the way for the release within hours of a
report, that no member of Congress has yet seen, with no effort at
prior scrutiny or editing of any of the graphic details of
Clinton's liaison with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The report's swift disclosure _ by way of the Internet _
promises the nation an extraordinary cyberspace look at the
narrative that prosecutors say provides ``substantial and
credible'' evidence that could warrant Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats were fuming at its hasty release. Rep. John
Conyers Jr., the senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee,
protested the report's posting on the Web to the Rules Committee:
``The House of Representatives is not the U.S. postal service. We
are not a delivery system for Kenneth W. Starr. We cannot, we ought
not, we should not, release anything to anybody unless we know what
it is we're releasing.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the Judiciary Committee chairman, Henry Hyde, told the
Rules Committee that ``it is important that we American people
learn the facts.'' He said he thought that Starr's report could be
released without prior scrutiny but said the committee would take
time to examine another still-sealed 2,000 pages of backup material
and boxes of grand jury testimony and videotapes also sent to
Congress. Those are to be put under the jurisdiction of the
Judiciary Committee for review, to be released publicly on Sept.
28, unless the committee decided to hold them back or edit
information.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions ran high in the House _ particularly among Democrats _
as it faced the possibility of impeachment proceedings for the
first time since 1974, when President Richard Nixon resigned
because of the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the pressures felt by Democrats worrying about
whether the scandal engulfing Clinton will affect their prospects
in elections just two months away, Democratic leaders said that
they expected many party members to vote for disclosure of Starr's
report on Friday despite their qualms. A fraction of Democrats as
well were among the voices calling for swift disclosure, hoping to
get the worst behind them as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since they returned from a summer recess,
House Democrats met behind closed doors on Thursday morning, with
party leaders trying to assure them that they were not facing a
rout at the polls in November and that they had to focus attention
on their strengths, like their positions on Social Security,
education, and an overhaul of regulation of health maintenance
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dick Gephardt, the House minority leader, emphasized to
his party's members, that the president's standing in the polls
should not affect any decision on whether to move ahead with
impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democrats said he told them that if the president had a
100 percent poll rating but evidence indicated that he had
committed an impeachable offense he should face the judgment of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   As the public learns the details of Starr's report over the
weekend, the Democratic reaction will be crucial for Clinton. The
House caucus was divided between those who were angrily protesting
that Clinton was not being allowed to see the accusations against
him and those who focused on what is expected to come in the
report.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Moran, D-Va., said some in the caucus said the
president's survival should be a priority. He said that he
disagreed. ``The Democrats are in minority and this is a train
heading downhill without a brake on it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Accusing White House aides of being too focused on trying to
beat the charges against the president, Moran said: ``It's not a
matter of beating charges. It's a matter of restoring the moral
authority of the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   But other Democrats protested the Republicans' refusal to give
Clinton an early look at Starr's report, noting that when House
Speaker Newt Gingrich was censured by the House on ethics charges,
he was allowed to review the report against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave Gingrich a week to look at it and respond to it,''
said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and a member of the Judiciary
Committee. ``The president is asking for two days. The Republicans
say no.''
</P>
<P>
   At midday, Clinton's private lawyer, David Kendall, along with
Charles Ruff, the White House counsel, and John Podesta, the White
House deputy chief of staff, came to Capitol Hill for a meeting
with Hyde. Both sides called the session cordial. But a Judiciary
Committee aides, who insisted on anonymity, said that Hyde opposed
their request for 48 hours to review the report before its release
and then refused to give them even an hour in advance.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For much of the day Republicans and Democrats looked for legal
precedents to bolster their arguments about how to proceed in a
situation without precedent. Never before has a report accusing the
president of impeachable offenses come before Congress under the
20-year-old law authorizing independent counsels.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, in an appearance on CNN, said that a review of a
special prosecutor's report before its release had ``never been
done before. It was never done during Watergate, never done in
Iran-Contra.'' He said he would allow Clinton's lawyer to post the
president's response to Starr's report on a House Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in the interview whether Clinton should resign, the
speaker said, ``I think only the president can answer that. He
knows in his heart what the facts are.''

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Sept. 11:
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut's 1st Congressional District, the Democratic
nomination is tantamount to election. History also suggests that
once elected, an incumbent will stay put for a very long time. So
this year's primary fight is an important one. Four candidates, all
with considerable experience in state government, are running to
succeed Rep. Barbara Kennelly. The field includes Secretary of
State Miles Rapoport; John Larson, the former president pro tem of
the state Senate; Joe Suggs, a former state treasurer and ex-mayor
of Bloomfield; and state Rep.Jim McCavanagh.
</P>
<P>
   Rapoport and Larson are the front runners, and for good reason.
Both men have been leaders throughout their political careers, even
though they pursue their goals with very different styles. Larson,
who ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination
in 1994, is a thoughtful moderate whose emphasis on issues of
education, jobs and health care are in sync with the concerns of
the district. Rapoport, a former state representative who is
perhaps a more daring politician, is best known for his role as a
leader in the drive to pass a state income tax. But his longtime
specialty is as an advocate for campaign finance reform and
measures to open up the voting process.
</P>
<P>
   Larson argues that voters would prefer his emphasis on
bread-and-butter issues to Rapoport's work on ``process.'' He may
be right. But in government, process helps shape policy. We also
believe that the nation's warped system of campaign finance stands
in the way of real progress on many matters. Rapoport seems likely
to be the more aggressive and innovative voice, and he gets our
endorsement.

BRACK `THREATENING' TO WRECK IRL'S BALANCE OF POWER 
RESENDING FOR ALL NEEDING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nobody has yet to confuse Kenny Brack with Jeff Gordon, meaning
Super Swede has been spared the boos, charges of cheating and
Web-bashing sites that have become synonymous with Maximum Jeff.
</P>
<P>
   But like NASCAR star Gordon, Brack is racking up a bit of
history this summer that threatens to turn his into a household
name. Brack is the first driver to win three consecutive Pep Boys
Indy Racing League events, baggage he will tote into Texas Motor
Speedway for the inaugural Lone Star 500K on Sept. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Brack's consecutive victories at Charlotte Motor Speedway, Pikes
Peak International Raceway and Atlanta Motor Speedway have not
followed a single script. But at each venue, he and team owner A.J.
Foyt of Houston have found a way to win, sometimes in spite of
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   At CMS, Brack led seven times for 76 laps, grabbing the lead
from Jeff Ward with 13 laps remaining. Brack passed Robbie Buhl
with three laps to go at Pikes Peak _ Brack's fuel tank was empty
and his Oldsmobile Aurora V-8 engine dead when he crossed the
finish line. At Atlanta, Brack shot past Ward into the lead with 14
laps remaining after debating with himself whether to settle for
third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm not that kind of a driver,'' said Brack, driver of
Foyt's No. 14 Power Team Dallara. ``I've never driven defensively.
If anything in my early career, I've maybe been too aggressive. I
think I've got a handle on that pretty well right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Buhl said motor racing often boils down to a big
confidence/momentum game.
</P>
<P>
   ``And right now, those guys have some momentum,'' said Buhl,
teammate to IRL poster boy Tony Stewart at Team Menard. ``That
helps you get through the season when you have a hiccup or miss a
beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Buzz Calkins, driver of the Bradley Motorsports Dallara and
co-champion of the IRL's inaugural 1996 season, said Brack is not
doing anything special.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I'm not going to say that they're cheating,''
Calkins said. ``I don't think they're completely lucky and that's
the reason. He's in an up-trend _ where they're quick on these type
tracks. They've got a setup that works well in the race, works well
in traffic, works well over a full fuel load. Your confidence gets
up there and it seems like you're doing stuff you maybe ordinarily
wouldn't do. That's what I think is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Goodyear, twice a runner-up in the Indianapolis 500, said
he might have put an end to the streak at Atlanta, where he was in
position to put Brack a lap down midway through a race. But a
caution came out, allowed Brack to stay on the lead lap and
eventually roll into Victory Lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes headlines, it makes news,'' said Goodyear, lead
driver for Pennzoil Panther Racing. ``We've got a great product
right now on the racetrack, and there's eight or 10 guys every
weekend that are capable of winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Brack, ironically, rates as an unlikely marquee name for the
IRL, which was formed by Indianapolis Motor Speedway president Tony
George to preserve the traditions of oval-track racing, cut costs
and give aspiring Americans a chance to race in the Indy 500.
</P>
<P>
   Brack, born in Glava, Sweden, 32 years ago, has spent his first
summer as A.J.'s protege living in Houston. Brack said Foyt has
been busy ``Texas-izing'' him. But Goodyear, a native of Canada now
living in Indianapolis, suggested that those who limit their IRL
rosters to all-Americans are missing the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the opportunity is there for anyone who wants to work
hard and have the tenacity to chase whatever their dream is,''
Goodyear said. ``Kenny's a young driver looking to make a mark in a
racing series. I think he's done a good job. He's with a good team.
They have a lot of experience and a wealth of knowledge. They've
put the package together.''
</P>
<P>
   Calkins said Brack's package is capable of winning the season's
final two races. And that is not necessarily bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives something for everyone to shoot at,'' Calkins said.
``Kenny is by no means unbeatable or untouchable. But he's
definitely in a good position. And I say more power to him, while
it's going in your direction. Everybody hopes for streaks like
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't really like Jeff Gordon. But if this continues for
a year ...'' let the Web-bashing begin.
\Nrailhed:THE BUZZ NASCAR Charges of ``soaked tires'' and
``sandbagging'' leveled by Winston Cup team owner Jack Roush during
the past two race weekends against rival crew chief Ray Evernham
have not affected the relationship between drivers Jeff Gordon and
Mark Martin. ``We want to race them. They want to race us. That
\Rflak\S came from Jack,'' Gordon said after winning his fourth
consecutive Pepsi Southern 500 at Darlington (S.C.) Raceway on
Sunday. Gordon's victory, combined with Martin's 40th-place finish
because of an engine problem, allowed Gordon to open a 199-point
lead after 24 of 33 races. ``We're just fierce competitors on the
track,'' Gordon said. ``It's great to be able to have a
relationship like that where you don't play mind games with each
other.'' Gordon said he and Evernham are on speaking terms with
both Martin and Jimmy Fennig, Martin's crew chief. ``We tested in
Atlanta with Mark, and Jimmy came over to us and said, `Don't
believe that's \Rcriticism\S coming from us.' Everything was
cool.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Gordon also confirmed that he and Martin swapped race cars for a
few hot laps during a Goodyear tire test at Atlanta Motor Speedway
last week. ``It had nothing to do with what happened at New
Hampshire,'' said Gordon, referring to the track where Roush and
Evernham got into a postrace shouting match over the allegedly
``soaked'' and softened tires on Gordon's No. 24 DuPont Automotive
Finishes Chevrolet. With that dispute simmering in the media,
Martin allowed Gordon to strap into the No. 6 Valvoline Ford Taurus
in exchange for a drive in his Monte Carlo. ``You see a lot of
differences in the way guys like their cars set up,'' Gordon said.
``He had his car set up pretty loose. I like mine a little
tighter.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Roush, meanwhile, said his Tiregate suspicions were heightened
the week before the CMT 300 in Loudon, N.H., when he received what
he described as some ``tire-softening material'' from a ``reputable
businessman'' he had bought oil additives from for 10 years.
``Before the Loudon race, I received a letter and an aerosol
substance in a can and I received a liquid substance in a can,''
Roush said. ``The instructions indicated it was undetectable, and
if you wanted it to be organized for a 10-lap sprint or full fuel
run on gas and tires, there was a different treatment technique.
And the claim was made the material was undetectable by traditional
ways of doing analysis.'' Roush said the letter also indicated that
``my competition was using this. It wasn't specific to the 24. It
wasn't specific to one competitor or more than one.'' IRL Pep Boys
Indy Racing League regular Buzz Calkins planted the first tire
marks of the Lone Star 500 weekend on the Turn 1 wall during a test
at Texas Motor Speedway yesterday afternoon. Calkins' car swapped
ends and hit the wall with the left side after a right rear tire
blew at approximately 220 mph. ``We were in the middle of a long
run, to see what the car would do with a full fuel load,'' Calkins
said as he surveyed the wreckage in the garage area. ``We just
switched from the G Force to the Dallara for the race at Atlanta
\Ron Aug. 29\S, trying to get more of an advantage on the
superspeedways. We only have this car. We've got two G Forces, but
those aren't doing us much good right now.'' Calkins estimated the
damage at $250,000, which is very bad considering his team is
leasing the chassis from car owner Jim Immke of Indianapolis. The
chassis, which has been driven this year by Tyce Carlson, was
leased with the stipulation that it be returned in the condition in
which it was loaned out. ``I'm not calling them,'' Calkins said.
``We're all picking straws to see who has to call them.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Gossage, executive vice president and general manager of
TMS, said track management originally projected a crowd of 40,000
for the track's first daytime IRL race on Sept. 20. ``We're already
a little bit over 60,000,'' Gossage said yesterday. ``And we're
over 50,000 on our ARCA race \Rthe Cowtown 250K on Sept. 19\S. The
numbers I'm telling you are paid numbers. They're not paid plus a
bunch of giveaways to fluff up the numbers. Real, live, paid
people. By the time \RIRL\S race day rolls around, we're going to
be 70,000-who-knows-what. I think it's pretty certain we'll have a
crowd here bigger than any crowd to see the Dallas Cowboys all year
long, and that's something to be proud of.'' CART Team owner Chip
Ganassi continues to circle the wagons at Target/Chip Ganassi
Racing from those nasty Formula One foreign invaders. On Tuesday,
Ganassi announced that he had signed American Jimmy Vasser, the
1996 Championship Auto Racing Teams FedEx Series champion, to a new
three-year contract. And Ganassi also attempted to defuse the
notion that Alex Zanardi, who wrapped up his second series title on
Sunday, is a lock to leave his team for F1. Zanardi, a six-time
winner in Ganassi's Target Reynard/Honda, left for his native Italy
after a fourth-place finish on the streets of Vancouver. F1 team
owner Frank Williams is apparently set to announce that Zanardi
will join his team beginning next year during the Italian Grand
Prix at Monza this weekend. ``I wouldn't say he's \RZanardi\S gone
yet,'' Ganassi said during a teleconference. ``I think there's a
chance he might stay. There's been no announcement on Zanardi, and
I can assure you there won't be for a while.'' Asked to elaborate,
Ganassi said, ``I would think sometime in the next three weeks, we
should know.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Ganassi called Vasser _ who has won two races this
season and is attempting to lock up second in the points chase _
one of the most underrated drivers in the series. ``He is someone I
feel is a backbone in any team,'' Ganassi said. For his part,
Vasser said he entertained feelers from the new British American
Racing team, where he would have been No. 2 driver to Jacques
Villeneuve, the former CART and reigning F1 champion. ``There was
some talk and so forth. It was initiated from the BAR side,''
Vasser said. ``It never came to a very serious formal offer,
although it was on the road to that, perhaps. I decided I'm
perfectly happy with my life and career path in the world of
CART.''
FAST LAPS Lights, cameras at TMS Texas Motor Speedway will serve as
backdrop for an episode of ``Walker, Texas Ranger'' set for filming
in November.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Norris, star of the CBS action/adventure series, said he
has been trying to develop a racing-related episode for about a
year and a half. A suitable screenplay has been developed, Norris
said yesterday, and it will include racing footage shot during the
Automobile Racing Club of America Cowtown 250K on Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Norris, Chuck's son and an aspiring NASCAR Winston West
driver, will attempt to qualify and race in the ARCA event to pile
up actual racing and crowd footage for the two-hour special.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Norris said the episode will carry a Native American
theme. And Eric's directive is succinct.

NORTHWEST AND PILOTS UNION GAIN TENTATIVE ACCORD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Adds details on pilots' agreement; polishing and clarification
throughout.)  (th) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Negotiators for Northwest Airlines and its pilots union reached
a tentative agreement Thursday to settle a 13-day strike that has
disrupted travel in the Midwest and South. .
</P>
<P>
   On a day when most of the focus in Washington was on the
political difficulties facing President Clinton, the president
announced the breakthrough personally in an evening statement to
reporters on the White House lawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the strike is over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and Transportation
Secretary Rodney Slater, Clinton praised the leaders at Northwest
and the Air Line Pilots Association and thanked the members of his
administration, including Bruce Lindsey, the White House deputy
counsel who was instrumental in bringing about the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are a lot of people who depend on Northwest who
are relieved tonight,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But Northwest will not begin flying again until the union has
accepted the pact. In a statement released after the president's
comments, the pilots union said its 17-member governing master
executive council would meet in Minneapolis on Saturday to decide
whether to approve the agreement. Until then, the pilots would
remain on strike, it added. The airline has said it will take eight
to 10 days after the pilots agree to return to work before the
airline can resume its full schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest and the union said they would not release details of
the tentative agreement until the executive council had examined
it. Northwest said it would not discuss details of the agreement
until the union took action on it.
</P>
<P>
   The Northwest pilots strike has been the longest against an
airline since 1989, when machinists shut down Eastern Airlines. All
of Northwest's nearly 1,700 flights have been grounded, sharply
reducing air travel in Northwest's hubs in Detroit, Minneapolis and
Memphis and the surrounding regions, where the airline was
dominant.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hardest hit states has been North Dakota, which
depends on Northwest for almost all of its air service. But in
cities like Detroit and Minneapolis, the disruption from the strike
was less than many people had expected. Other airlines increased
their flights to the cities, businesses made other arrangements and
people simply stayed home.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of disruption undermined dire predictions by Northwest
before the strike as it tried to put pressure on Clinton to use his
executive powers to order the pilots back to work, as he did last
year when pilots struck at American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has happened is that passengers have found it easier to
book elsewhere,'' said Robert Litan, the director of economic
studies at the Brookings Institution who was hired by Northwest to
assess the economic damage of a strike.
</P>
<P>
   Litan's study said the damage would equal $730 million in the
strike's first 10 days. But this week he said his revised estimate
was about two-thirds of his original estimate with more than half
coming from the fact that Northwest ceased operations and laid off
30,000 of its 51,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots walked out on Aug. 29 after two years of
negotiations. The main issue in the dispute was pay. The pilots
wanted a substantial raise to make up for wage concessions they
made in 1993 that helped Northwest avoid bankruptcy. They were also
concerned that Northwest would shift their workload to smaller
commuter jets flown by pilots who are paid much smaller salaries.
</P>
<P>
   The airline said that it was willing to give the pilots a raise
but that it could not afford to pay them more than their
counterparts at its three larger competitors: United Airlines,
American Airlines, and Delta Airlines. The union says the pilots
receive an average salary of $120,000 a year; the company puts that
figure at $133,000.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But behind those apparently narrow differences were years of
simmering resentment on both sides. The pilots accused Northwest of
dragging its feet while the airline racked up record profits and
its top executives cashed in stock options worth millions. The
company said a group of radical leaders at the pilots union had
been spoiling for a strike since early 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The hard feelings had prevented the two sides from returning to
the bargaining table. Slater called John Dasburg, Northwest's chief
executive, and J. Randolph Babbitt, president of the Air Line
Pilots Association, to a meeting in Washington last weekend to see
whether there were areas of compromise. Negotiators for both sides
met separately in Chicago last weekend with federal mediators.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not until Lindsey flew to Minneapolis with Slater on
Tuesday afternoon that negotiations began again in earnest, said
those involved in the discussions. By late Wednesday night, after a
long day of bargaining, the pilots had a made a compromise offer
and the company had responded. A deal seemed within reach.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, Lindsey was at the airport preparing to leave
when he received a call from the White House. The pilots union was
asking for him to return to the talks to help hammer out a
settlement. By afternoon, the two sides had a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton then called Dasburg and Babbitt to urge both men to wrap
up the negotiations as soon as possible, an administration official
said.
</P>
<P>
   One person involved in the negotiations who insisted on
anonymity said the pilots had relaxed their wage demands and agreed
instead to incentives such as stock options.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the union leaders will approve the the deal is an open
question. Over the summer, Northwest reached an accord with
negotiators for the International Association of Machinists, which
represent 27,000 workers, but members voted down the contract in
July.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the pilot leaders approve the contract, the damage to
the airline has already been substantial.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts estimate that Northwest has lost $250
million to $300 million and that it is likely to lose more as it
begins fare discounts and other promotions to draw back passengers.
The carrier's stock price has fallen more than 60 percent since the
spring, largely because of the strike.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots have lost the wages they would have earned from
flying and have weakened a company in a business in which which
profits and growth provide them with the best job security and
opportunities to increase their earnings.

DEVILS SIGN 3 OF THEIR FREE AGENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New Jersey Devils Thursday signed three of their free agents
_ Denis Pederson, Sheldon Souray and Steve Brule _ and threatened
to lock out two others who have not agreed to new contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not allow anyone without a contract to work with the
team during training camp,'' Lou Lamoriello, the team's president
and general manager, said Thursday. ``I don't want any distractions
in the locker room with questions every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Niedermayer and Petr Sykora have not signed contracts with
training camp set to open on Sunday. Niedermayer, the offensive
defenseman, is asking for about $4 million a year, comparable to
what the Devils are paying Scott Stevens, the captain. The Devils
are offering about half that amount. Niedermayer's negotiations
with the Devils through his agent, Don Meehan, have come to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   The two parties have not spoken for about a week, and
Niedermayer said from his British Columbia home that the two
parties were ``quite far apart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't be a good sign if things were bitter,'' said
Niedermayer, who was married in the summer and is likely to extend
his honeymoon beyond the opening of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Sykora, a native of the Czech Republic, who is currently in
Edmonton, Alberta, will settle for a contract much less than
Niedermayer's, but he is just as valuable to the Devils now that
Doug Gilmour signed with Chicago as an unrestricted free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Finding an adequate replacement for Gilmour will be the most
difficult task for coach Robbie Ftorek. Brendan Morrison and Sykora
are the two players Ftorek is counting on the most to fill the void
left by Gilmour, the team's best forward the last two seasons.

BURN BEATS FIRE, 3-2, ON BUZZER-BEATER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By TROY PHILLIPS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Try putting a finger on the most important goal in
Dallas Burn history, and none stands out like the heart-stopper
Jorge Rodriguez scored last night.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's final run from his defender spot netted a goal with
two seconds remaining in the Burn's 3-2 victory against the Chicago
Fire at the Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Burn (14-15) vaulted over Kansas City into fourth place in
Major League Soccer's Western Conference. Dallas ended an 0-for-4
streak against the expansion Fire (17-11), which had clinched one
of four MLS West playoff spots.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's tapper past Fire goalkeeper Zach Thornton capped a
two-goal comeback for the Burn, which tied the score at 2 in the
83rd minute. That score came on a corner-kick header by Dante
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fought back and were able to get the second one,''
Washington said. ``They say it's never over until the final
whistle. That was never more true than tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Second-half goals by Fire counterattack artist Ante Razov and
21-year-old phenom Josh Wolff erased a 1-0 Burn halftime lead.
Razov turned Burn defender Richard Farrer inside out. Wolff, whose
footwork dazzled all night, finished off a good combination of
Chicago passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the guys, let's save all our goals against Chicago
until the end of the last game we play 'em,'' Dallas coach Dave Dir
joked. ``I hadn't thought of my shootout lineup, so I'm glad we
scored.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas ended a six-game first-half scoring slump when Jason
Kreis ripped a 30-yard free kick past Thornton in the seventh
minute. Three of Kreis' eight goals this season have come on free
kicks.
</P>
<P>
   Goalkeeper Mark Dodd, who finished with seven saves, ignited the
Burn's final attack with 12 seconds remaining. He sprinted 20 yards
to corral a ball off the end line, clearing to Leonel Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, Alvarez connected upfield with Oscar Pareja,
whose over-the-top strike to Rodriguez found its mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I looked up, I saw 26 seconds,'' Rodriguez, a
Salvadoran, said through a translator. ``That's when I ran forward,
knowing I was our last chance to get a goal. It's definitely one of
the biggest I've ever scored.''

METS HOLD ON TO BEAT PHILLIES, 7-5 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The question put to Al Leiter after he had just
picked up his 15th victory of the season was only half in jest. It
was a question of location.
</P>
<P>
   Did you have more trouble watching the near-collapse here in the
clubhouse than you did out on the field? The Mets had just held on
for a 7-5 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies, in a game Leiter
had left with a 7-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' said the left-hander, who allowed two hits in seven
sharp innings. ``But I always do.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiter was right. He had much less trouble with the Phillies
Thursday night than Mets manager Bobby Valentine would have had if
the Mets had coughed away the lead with Leiter icing his arm in the
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine was aware of that. But he was trying to give Leiter a
break before he makes his next start on one less day of rest, and
to give some of his relievers a little work in a game the Mets
seemed to have under control. It appeared to be a good idea even to
Leiter. Until the lead started unraveling. But the Mets were able
to hold on and stay even with the Cubs in the National League wild
card race.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was too tight,'' Valentine said with a sigh of relief
after John Franco got the final two outs with the tying runs on
base for his 34th save. ``It was my fault for letting it get that
tight,'' Valentine added. ``I was looking to the future. I
shouldn't do that right now. I learned my lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   Without having to pay for it. Pretty soon, however, it is the
Mets who will have to pay if they want Leiter to stay with the
Mets. And they probably won't mind doing it, either.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, general manager Steve Phillips acknowledged Thursday,
have recently broached talks with Leiter's representatives in the
hopes they can re-sign the 32-year-old before he can become a free
agent this fall.
</P>
<P>
   In his first season with the Mets, Leiter has become the ace of
the staff. And Thursday night, in the midst of a tight race for the
postseason _ and with John Olerud back in New York awaiting the
birth of his first child _ Leiter cruised in his seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really pretty easy,'' Leiter said. It sure looked that
way until the bullpen came in.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome, which enabled the Mets (82-65) to pull a
season-high 17 games over .500, should never really have been in
doubt, as the Mets scored five runs in the top of the first off
Tyler Green, three of them on Mike Piazza's 30th home run of the
season, which also gave him 100 runs batted in for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter (15-5) has now won 12 of his last 14 decisions. He
retired the first 10 batters he faced, before Kevin Sefcik grounded
a three-hop single over the turf and past Rey Ordonez at short and
became Philadelphia's first base-runner of the game. Sefcik's hit
followed four consecutive strikeouts by Leiter.
</P>
<P>
   The second _ and final _ hit that Leiter would allow was a
two-out, two-run home run to shortstop Desi Relaford in the bottom
of the fifth, which was preceded by the first of Leiter's two
walks.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets answered with a run in the sixth on a lead-off
double from Piazza and a one-out, run-scoring single by Lenny
Harris that hit off the glove of second baseman Mark Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Leiter struck out eight, threw 104 pitches, and his
earned run average rose almost imperceptibly from 2.39 to 2.40,
still second-best in the NL.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Before the game, Phillips also acknowledged that he had spoken
with Dennis Cook's representatives about re-signing with the Mets.
That leaves Piazza, who again admitted before the game that he is
enjoying himself in a New York uniform, as the only big-name free
agent the Mets have yet to begin discussions with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely am having fun,'' said Piazza, who went 2 for 4
and is 17 for 31 during his current nine-game hitting streak.
``It's always good playing when the games are meaningful. There are
20-something other teams out there just showing up. If you can't
enjoy this, then you've got a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Which does not necessarily mean Piazza will re-sign with the
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really nothing I can say about that,'' Piazza said.
``I'm not worried about making a decision right now. I believe in
first things first.''
</P>
<P>
   Like qualifying for the post-season. And on a day when the Mets
were without their leading hitter, Piazza picked up his share of
the slack.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud left the Mets late Wednesday night to be with his wife,
Kelly, who went into labor Thursday morning, but had not delivered
by game time. Matt Franco started at first and batted third in
Olerud's place.
</P>
<P>
   Franco, meanwhile, said that he had been joking with Olerud the
last few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `C'mon, man, when are you going to have it?''' Franco
said, before going 1 for 3 with an eighth-inning double that drove
home the Mets' seventh run.
</P>
<P>
   That is because Franco likes to play. And Thursday evening, he
substituted admirably for Olerud, the league's second-leading
hitter, with a .343 average, when the day began.
</P>
<P>
   In his first at-bat, Franco, who would later rob Rico Brogna of
extra bases with a diving snare to thwart a potential rally in the
sixth, dropped down a textbook sacrifice on the first pitch from
Green, after the Philadelphia right-hander had walked Tony Phillips
and Edgardo Alfonzo to open the game.
</P>
<P>
   That put runners on second and third for Piazza. Three pitches
later, everyone was running toward home, after Piazza, who now has
four homers in his last eight games, crushed a sizzling line drive
that cleared the railing above the left field scoreboard for a 3-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets would score twice more off Green (6-10), on a two-out
double that Rey Ordonez drilled into the left-field corner to score
Brian McRae and Carlos Baerga. And with Leiter on the mound, there
was little doubt that the pressure was now on the Cubs to keep pace
in the wild card race.
</P>
<P>
   Until Leiter came out.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Carlos Moya, the 1998 French Open champion, checked
his internal confidence meter two weeks ago and experienced a rude
awakening. It was empty. With the U.S. Open around the corner, he
estimated his chances of survival to be next to none, especially if
he let his thoughts wander to last year when he lost in the first
round.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old Majorcan was puzzled by his state of mind again
Thursday, but this time in a positive way. He reached the semifinal
round of the U.S. Open with a bravura 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 blitz of Magnus
Larsson of Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you tell me at the beginning of the week that I'm going to
be in semifinal, I would say you're crazy,'' said the 10th-seeded
Moya, the sole seeded player to emerge from the bottom half of the
draw. ``I thought I cannot beat anyone the way I was playing. My
confidence was below zero. But I won the French Open. I won Monte
Carlo. I'm in the semifinals. I don't have to be afraid of
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Moya will meet Mark Philippoussis, who on Thursday night won
perhaps the most gripping match of the tournament. After 3 hours 26
minutes and a two-man total of 50 aces, Philippoussis reached the
first Grand Slam semifinal of his career by defeating Thomas
Johansson of Sweden, 4-6, 6-3, 6-7 (3-7), 6-3, 7-6 (12-10).
</P>
<P>
   With Patrick Rafter already in the semifinals, there are now two
Australian men in the final four. Philippoussis got there by saving
three match points in the final tie breaker. He needed three of his
own to close it out, finally winning with a huge first serve up the
middle that Johansson returned wide.
</P>
<P>
   It was Philippoussis' first quarterfinal at the U.S. Open, and
Johansson's first Grand Slam quarterfinal. It showed on occasion.
Philippoussis was broken three times in the opening set, as he
overhit frequently against the smaller but more consistent Swede.
</P>
<P>
   Moya's game is not the run-and-gun style favored by classic
hardcourts swashbucklers like Patrick Rafter and the top-ranked
Pete Sampras. And while Moya admits that clay is his natural
surface, his opponents would be wise to remember that he is the
all-court acolyte.
</P>
<P>
   Moya dethroned Boris Becker, the 1996 Australian Open champion,
in the opening round in 1997. Late in 1996, Becker made the mistake
of telling the rangy Spaniard that he had the talent to compete as
well on hardcourts as his native red clay. Moya took the advice to
heart, and now, after coming into this event worried about
surviving the first round, he has revised his expectations and
hopes to become the first man since Mats Wilander to win the French
Open and the U.S. Open in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I want to be like Wilander; he won them both like 10 years
ago,'' said Moya, whose math is as accurate as his play has been.
</P>
<P>
   The last Spanish man to reach the Open's semifinal round was
Manuel Orantes, who went on to win the 1975 title.
</P>
<P>
   Moya said it was his emotional second-round victory against
Michael Chang, a night-time comeback from a two-sets-to-none
deficit that took 3 hours 49 minutes and left the Spaniard on his
knees and close to tears when Chang finally capitulated, that
changed his attitude and his luck. That 3-6, 1-6, 7-6, 6-4, 6-3
resurrection marked the first time Moya had reversed such a dire
deficit and the first time he had dropped the first two sets of a
five-set match.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Moya vowed that if he could survive that, he could
survive anything. He got to put that fortitude to the test in the
next round, where Jan-Michael Gambill forced him to a fifth-set tie
breaker before backing off.
</P>
<P>
   The victory against Gambill, combined with the Chang marathon,
gave him consecutive victories in Grand Slam epics for the first
time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``My luck started to change in that match against Chang; after
there, I realized I'm doing better than I think,'' said Moya who
warded off three match points. ``Saving those few match points made
me trust more in myself. And with what happened against Gambill, it
gives you a lot of power. You think that nobody can beat you right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The suddenly self-assertive Spaniard, whose brown tresses have
fully recovered from being shorn to the roots when he did his
mandatory stint in the Spanish army last summer, had never faced
Larsson, but he was not worried.
</P>
<P>
   Five rounds into this Open, it dawned on Moya that, with a Grand
Slam under his belt and a visit to a Grand Slam hardcourts finale
20 months ago, he was in charge of his destiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a better player right now,'' Moya said. ``I take more
risks than before, go more often to net. I'm serving better.''
</P>
<P>
   Moya was successful on 81 percent of his first service points
Thursday and 71 percent of his second service points. He served his
only ace at an appropriate juncture: match point of the 90-minute
no-contest. Larsson earned only one break point and left it
unconverted, while Moya exploited 4 of 9 break chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've started to play well in the right moment, which is this
tournament,'' Moya said.
</P>
<P>
   MATCH POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams and Max Mirnyi, who won Wimbledon's mixed
doubles title on their first stint as partners, added the U.S. Open
crown to their collection Thursday with a 6-2, 6-2 defeat of Lisa
Raymond and Pat Galbraith. The title constituted a sweep of the
1998 mixed doubles events at Grand Slam events by the Williams
sisters: Venus Williams won the Australian Open and the French Open
with New Jersey's Justin Gimelstob; Serena and her clay-court
partner, Luis Lobo, were runners-up at the French Open.

   LOS ANGELES _ When it comes to making the perfect car, foreign
manufacturers came closer to the mark this year than their domestic
counterparts, concludes a study to be released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Audi captured the top spot followed by two models each from
Lexus and Mercedes-Benz in the Automobile Club of Southern
California's annual target car report. Points are based on how well
a model performs during tests by the club's engineering staff of
what members say are a car's 12 most important features.
</P>
<P>
   ``These particular cars are the ones that meet the criteria that
more people said they wanted in a car, and these manufacturers are
coming closer to the mark for what we would call the ideal car,''
spokesman Jeffrey Spring said. Those include braking, ride quality,
visibility for passengers, crashworthiness, handling, luggage
carrying capability, fuel economy and acceleration.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 Audi A4 Avant Quattro finished first with 69.9 points.
The car, which cost $36,830, impressed testers with its handling,
all-wheel drive traction and safety features. But they also found
the rear seat to be small and the radio and cruise control buttons
awkward to use.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the top five were the Lexus GS 400, priced at
$48,161; the Mercedes-Benz E320 station wagon, priced at $54,150;
the Lexus LS 400, priced at $55,022; and the Mercedes-Benz CLK 320
priced at $45,310.
</P>
<P>
   The top-scoring truck, with 76.8 points, was the Dodge Ram 1500
4x4 Quad Cab SLT, which cost $31,565. The car with the lowest cost
per point was the Suzuki Esteem GL, with 54.2 points and a $12,929
price tag.
</P>
<P>
   About 4 million California residents belong to the Auto Club.
The report will be available next week for $7.50 a copy.
</P>
<P>
   Ken McEldowney, executive director of San Francisco-based
Consumer Action, said such studies have a positive impact.
``Consumers, with their spending decisions, can affect the
marketplace and reward the companies producing the cars that are
closest to the target,'' he said, adding such reports can also
pressure makers of underperformers to improve.

STARR REPORT: PLENTY ON LEWINSKY, LITTLE ON WHITEWATER

 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The report sent to Congress by the Whitewater
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, contends that evidence shows
that President Clinton committed perjury, obstructed justice,
tampered with witnesses and abused the power of his office in
trying to cover up an affair with Monica Lewinsky, lawyers familiar
with the report said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's 445-page report, however, lists no impeachable offenses
arising from the majority of Starr's four-year-old inquiry on such
matters as the failed Whitewater land deal, the alleged misuse of
FBI files or the alleged coverup in the White House travel office
matter. Lawyers did say the report draws parallels between the
White House conduct in the Lewinsky inquiry and efforts that they
say were made during the Whitewater inquiry to cover up what
actually happened.
</P>
<P>
   The report asserts that Clinton lied during his civil deposition
in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit in January and during
his grand jury testimony last month from the White House, three
lawyers who insisted on anonymity said.
</P>
<P>
   In a 140-page section that outlines possible grounds for
impeachment, prosecutors use graphic descriptions of sexual
encounters to try to contradict Clinton's months-long denial of his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. They also accuse Clinton of abusing
the power of his office by using government resources to attempt to
thwart Starr's inquiry for seven months, the lawyers said. Abuse of
power was one of the impeachment counts leveled against Richard
Nixon in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   That section also outlines Starr's contention that the president
relied on government lawyers and senior aides to deny repeatedly to
the public that Clinton had had an inappropriate or improper
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, the 25-year-old former White House
intern. And, the lawyers said, prosecutors are also critical of the
privilege claims filed by government lawyers to try to block the
grand jury testimony of White House aides and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also give details that they say show how Clinton
tried to influence the testimony of Ms. Lewinsky and his personal
secretary. They also include evidence that they say demonstrates
that he obstructed justice through trying to help Ms. Lewinsky find
a job and retrieve gifts that had been subpoenaed in the Jones
case.
</P>
<P>
   The long-awaited report, which the House of Representatives
plans to post on the Internet on Friday, is ``a damaging narrative
that reads like a novel,'' one lawyer familiar with its contents
said Thursday. ``It accuses the president of lying and obstructing,
over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   The report culminated an investigation into Clinton that began
on Jan. 12, 1994, under Robert Fiske Jr. and then continued later
that year under Starr.
</P>
<P>
   During a meeting with Senate Democrats at the White House,
Clinton assured them they would find ``no surprises'' in Starr's
report.
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, the president's lawyer, said Thursday that the
report is nothing more than a collection of prosecutors'
``contentions, claims and allegations and we look forward to the
chance to rebut them.''
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the report was not made available to The New York
Times, but the shape of the report was described in interviews on
Thursday with three lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The referral to Congress of possible impeachable offenses does
not conclude Starr's criminal inquiry. Starr's prosecutors have
grand juries still active, which might pursue criminal charges
against presidential aides whose actions are seen by prosecutors as
aiding a systemic White House abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation of the obstruction of justice portion of the
report is the allegation that Clinton played a pivotal role in an
attempt by his friend, Vernon Jordan, to find Ms. Lewinsky a job in
the private sector last December, the lawyers said. The report also
lays out a case that the president played a role in Ms. Lewinsky's
decision to return several presidential gifts, which had been
sought by a subpoena from Jones' lawyers, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Both actions were intended to keep Ms. Lewinsky from telling the
truth to the Jones lawyers, the prosecutors contend.
</P>
<P>
   In his grand jury testimony, Clinton denied that he had sought
to help Ms. Lewinsky secure a job or retrieve the gifts, his allies
have said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also details the fact that Clinton summoned his
secretary, Betty Currie, to the White House on Sunday, Jan. 18, the
day after Clinton was asked a series of questions about Ms.
Lewinsky in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a White House official dismissed the Currie meeting
as an effort by the president to ``refresh his recollection'' about
Ms. Lewinsky's visits and other matters. But the report attests
that Clinton asked Ms. Currie questions to try to influence her as
a potential witness in the Jones case, the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contend that Clinton also tried to interfere with
the Jones lawsuit as early as the summer of 1997, the lawyers said.
In May 1997, the Supreme Court ruled, unanimously, that the Jones
lawsuit would proceed while Clinton was still in office. Within a
week, Mrs. Jones' lawyers had said they would attempt to interview
under oath other women linked to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   That summer, the report says, Clinton asked Ms. Lewinsky to keep
their relationship a secret. That request came six months before
the former White House intern was subpoenaed to testify in the
case, the lawyers said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At a White House meeting in mid-July, the lawyers said, Clinton
also encouraged Ms. Lewinsky to urge her friend and another
potential witness, Linda Tripp, to stay silent about a White House
volunteer, Kathleen Willey, who said she resisted an unwanted
sexual advance from the president just outside the Oval Office. Ms.
Tripp bumped into Ms. Willey shortly after the alleged encounter.
</P>
<P>
   In the 140-page section that lays out the grounds for possible
impeachment proceedings, there are several ``salacious and
detailed'' references to sexual encounters between Clinton and Ms.
Lewinsky inside the president's private study near the Oval Office,
the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer who is familiar with Starr's strategy said that
prosecutors felt they had to include such material in the section
of the report that discusses whether Clinton had lied to the grand
jury. Clinton denied in his grand jury testimony that he lied about
their relationship in his Jones deposition.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 17, Clinton testified to the grand jury that he had
``inappropriate intimate physical contact'' with Ms. Lewinsky. But
he insisted that the contacts did not meet the definition of
``sexual relations'' established in the Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in his address to the nation that evening, Clinton said
his answers in the Jones deposition about Ms. Lewinsky were
``legally accurate,'' though he acknowledged they were misleading.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say in the report, however, that Clinton lied before
the grand jury when he said that his sexual encounters with Ms.
Lewinsky did not constitute ``sexual relations,'' as defined in the
Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors argue that the president's refusal to answer
detailed grand jury questions about sexual encounters with Ms.
Lewinsky compelled prosecutors to ask Ms. Lewinsky to return to the
grand jury in late August. In that session, they asked her more
detailed questions about her contacts with Clinton, the lawyers
said. Many of those details are included in the report, including a
discussion of the blue dress that Ms. Lewinsky turned over to
prosecutors, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, new details surfaced that could offend the
sensibilities of congressmen who have to weigh the evidence
presented in Starr's report. Ms. Lewinsky told the grand jury of
two separate instances that she and the president were engaged in a
sex act at the same time that Clinton talked on the telephone with
a member of Congress in November 1995, a lawyer familiar with her
testimony said on Thursday. The identities of the two congressmen
were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   A three-part definition of ``sexual relations'' was prepared by
Ms. Jones' lawyers before Clinton's Jan. 17 deposition. But in
responding to an objection of Clinton's lawyer, Judge Susan Webber
Wright of U.S. District Court in Little Rock, Ark. limited the
definition from three parts to just Part I:
</P>
<P>
   ``For the purposes of this deposition, a person engages in
`sexual relations' when the person knowingly engages in or causes
contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or
buttocks of any person with an intent to arouse or gratify the
sexual desire of any person.''
</P>
<P>
   But when he was asked in the deposition about Ms. Lewinsky,
Clinton consulted the same definition before he denied that he had
had sexual relations with the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the testimony of Ms. Lewinsky, prosecutors believe that
denial was a lie under oath, the lawyers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While working around the clock over the Labor Day weekend and
intensely for the past several weeks, prosecutors had always
intended to file the report ``as quickly as possible,'' one lawyer
said. There was originally a plan to send a referral letter to
Speaker Newt Gingrich and minority leader Richard Gephardt on
Wednesday, followed several days later by the report.
</P>
<P>
   But some lawyers in the office were concerned that Kendall would
file a motion trying to limit the report's contents, or demanding
its early release. For that reason, the referral letter and the
report were sent Wednesday afternoon, at virtually the same time,
with only 15 minutes' warning.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, some staff members of the House Judiciary
Committee had sent signals that they hoped Starr would submit an
executive summary, which could easily be made public. And, lawyers
said Thursday, prosecutors did in fact draw up a draft of an
executive summary, but Starr himself concluded that it was too
argumentative and scrapped the summary's working draft.

CHURCH LEADER SAYS HE MADE MISTAKES, SEEKS FORGIVENESS AT
CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EDWARD M. EVELD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Rev. Henry J. Lyons on Thursday looked
out solemnly at thousands of church members in Bartle Hall to ask
their indulgence. This was his moment to say he was sorry again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be a perfect president,'' said Lyons, head of the
National Baptist Convention USA Inc., the largest black church
organization in the country. ``It took me all my life to come to
this office.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyons found support among the church's delegates in Kansas City,
who earlier in the day passed a resolution urging forgiveness for
personal misconduct by another president _ Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In his annual address to the convention, Lyons said he never
wanted to bring shame and disgrace to the church top office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have made some mistakes. I have made some serious
miscalculations of judgment,'' Lyons said, as he has in the past.
``I want you to know truly from the bottom of my heart, from the
bottom of my soul, I am sorry for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask you for your mercy. I ask black America and white
America for your mercy.''
</P>
<P>
   As Lyons pulled off his glasses and wiped his eyes with a
handkerchief, thousands of delegates stood with their president,
applauding his apology and shouting, ``Amen!'' to his words.
</P>
<P>
   After asking church members for their understanding, Lyons, who
always gets high marks for preaching, launched into a thunderous
sermon about the healing power of Jesus, bringing at times laughter
and tears from the flock.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his mounting troubles, Lyons survived another year as
National Baptist president. In July he was indicted on federal
theft and fraud charges, accused of bilking corporations out of
millions of dollars and spending convention funds on a lavish
lifestyle. He faces similar state charges filed last February. He
pleaded not guilty to the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons, a pastor in St. Petersburg, Fla., admitted on Monday in
Kansas City an ``improper'' relationship with Brenda Harris, the
organization's executive director of conventions and meetings. The
two-year affair ended in 1997, he said. Lyons and his wife,
Deborah, have been married since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons did not mention Bernice Edwards, the former public
relations director for the convention, with whom he bought a
$700,000 waterfront home in Florida. Harris and Edwards also face
charges of misusing church money.
</P>
<P>
   At the annual meeting last year in Denver, dissident ministers
forced a vote on removing Lyons, but it failed. With one day left
at this year's meeting, no formal call has come for his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, just before Lyons took the stage Thursday, supporters
organized a fund-raiser for his legal defense.
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of minutes, with urging from the podium, more than
30 donations of $500 each had been collected. The Rev. E.V. Hill of
Los Angeles read the names of donors as checks were collected,
imploring others to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. John D. Chaplin of Washington told members to give
Lyons their ``love offering.'' While the names of $100, $200 and
$500 donors were announced, ushers passed white plastic buckets
down the rows as collection plates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know when the devil is at his worst, God is at his best,''
said Chaplin. ``You all know the strategy here. The strategy is to
break us, to bankrupt us, so we can't defend ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Church members, said the Rev. Timothy Fleming of Georgia, must
stick together.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could happen to any one of us. It can happen to any
preacher here,'' said Fleming. ``We can't preach the gospel of
forgiveness and practice unforgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in that spirit of forgiveness that the convention
Thursday passed a resolution supporting President Clinton. Because
the president offered a sincere apology for his personal conduct,
the resolution said, he and his family deserved ``loving
forgiveness and prayerful support.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution quoted a Bible passage from Galatians, the same
passage quoted in pro-Lyons fliers circulated at the convention:
``Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are
spiritual, restore such a one in the spirit of meekness.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyons, who established close ties to Clinton after Lyons was
elected church president in 1994, used his address to defend
Clinton and criticize independent counsel Kenneth Starr's
investigation and Republican detractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to let America know, we want the world to know, we
stand firmly behind our president. We'd like to see the majority
Republican Congress get off his back,'' Lyons said. ``We accepted
his words. We thank God he and Mrs. Clinton are faring well, and we
are praying for them.''
</P>
<P>
   In another resolution, members approved a rule that churches
that failed to register at this year's meeting and pay their dues
would not be allowed to vote in the 1999 election for president.
The rule, in effect, means that ministers who withheld funds
because of their concerns about Lyons' financial management can't
vote for the next president.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons said that for now he planned to run for re-election next
year. At least five others have announced their candidacies,
including Lyons' longstanding critics, the Rev. William Shaw of
Philadelphia and the Rev. W. Franklyn Richardson of Mount Vernon,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lyons told members the financial footing of the
convention was sound, he also said the church needed $664,000 by
Oct. 15 on a loan that is coming due. He implored members to help
meet that deadline, even if they were still unhappy with him as
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just say, `I'm still mad with him, but I'm going to give the
money anyway,' '' Lyons said.
</P>
<P>
   Come January, $300,000 more will be due, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the game plan,'' Lyons said. ``I have always told you
exactly where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Lyons thanked members for contributions to his
legal defense fund. He recounted in his sermon the New Testament
story about a sickly woman who worked her way through a crowd just
to touch Jesus' garment in hopes of being healed. At the same time,
a rich man was trying to get Jesus to come to his home to heal his
dying daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons likened the rich man to the main course at a restaurant,
the woman to a lowly side dish.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're the main course,'' he told church members, who raised
their arms in praise and spilled out into the aisles at Bartle
Hall, ``and I'm the side order.''

WHAT A MESSY WEB WE WEAVE WITH STARR REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bizarre new chapter opens today in the history of
the American presidency.
</P>
<P>
   With the click of a computer mouse, millions of Americans will
learn more about a chief executive's private life than they will
ever know about most of their friends' or their relatives' personal
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a last-minute change of plan, clicking on any one of
four Internet sites will yield access to independent counsel
Kenneth Starr's report to Congress on President Clinton's affair
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The report is expected to lay bare the sorts of secrets that
presidents once wouldn't have told even their closest aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had a situation where so much is going to become
known about a president's personal life,'' Democratic public
opinion researcher John Russonello said. ``This is breaking new
ground in public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   He said no one ``can pretend to know'' how the public will
react.
</P>
<P>
   The public is clamoring for the report, said Republican House
members who were happy to oblige.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our phone is ringing off the hook,'' said Rep. Porter Goss,
R-Fla. ``I'm sure other members are getting cards and letters and
plenty of input.''
</P>
<P>
   The House was expected to approve a resolution today clearing
the way for release of the report, which includes an introduction,
a narrative on the allegations and a section on grounds for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never before will Congress have made such a document so widely
available so quickly, and simultaneously to everyone,'' said Rep.
Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   The clerk of the House, Robin H. Carle, was bracing for an
unprecedented number of Internet ``hits.'' The House decided to
post the document on four sites to spread out the traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Connolly, a House Judiciary Committee spokesman, said
the potential problem of massive online activity was being
addressed, but he wouldn't say how.
</P>
<P>
   The Library of Congress is expected to be assigned the
responsiblity for getting the report online, if Congress gives the
green light. Congress announced that the documents, if made
available, could be accessed at these sites: &QL; 
http://www.house.gov/icreport, &QL; 
http://thomas.loc.gov/icreport, &QL; 
http://www.house.gov/judiciary and
http://www.access.gpo.gov/congress/ &QL; 
icreport.
</P>
<P>
   Some Clinton loyalists have privately concocted a worst-case
scenario. They fear that Americans could be so distracted by images
of the president's sex life that he would be unable to govern and
be forced to resign.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing, a former White House aide said, to hear Clinton
confess to an ``inappropriate'' relationship, as he did last month.
It is quite another to have a mental picture of the president
engaged in a specific sexual act.
</P>
<P>
   In his cover letter to House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Starr hinted
that the evidence he sent to Congress may include graphic details
of Clinton's sexual relationship with Lewinsky. But it is uncertain
whether the sexual details would appear in the report's narrative
or in supporting materials that won't immediately be made public,
if they are released at all.
</P>
<P>
   At least one public opinion expert thinks the Democrats' worst
fears about a shocked public may not be realized.

   ``It's hard to imagine that there's going to be a wholesale

MOYA'S RUN CONTINUES 
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ His past US Opens gave Carlos Moya little
encouragement entering this year's edition.
</P>
<P>
   A summer of tennis futility, losses in the first round of three
straight tournaments, only made matters worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that time I thought, `I cannot beat anyone,''' Moya said.
``My confidence was below zero.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for riding high into the last of the year's Grand Slam
tournaments. But Moya, expecting little, has come up with a lot and
Thursday earned a berth in Saturday's semifinals with a solid 6-4,
6-3, 6-3 win over Magnus Larsson.
</P>
<P>
   Moya takes on Australian Mark Philippoussis, an even more
surprising semifinalist. Philippoussis held off Thomas Johansson,
4-6, 6-3, 6-7 (3-7), 6-3, 7-6 (12-10), with a dramatic finish
Thursday night to gain his first Grand Slam semi.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Patrick Rafter and four-time winner Pete
Sampras, both of whom advanced Wednesday, square off in the other
semi.
</P>
<P>
   Philippoussis was up, 10-9, in the final tiebreaker but fell
trying to reach and volley a great passing shot.
</P>
<P>
   But on the next point, Johansson put a backhand into the net.
Then Philippoussis served for the match.
</P>
<P>
   He blasted a 123-mile-per-hour serve that Johansson couldn't
handle, and after 3 hours 26 minutes, it was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got some good first serves in when I needed it,''
Philippoussis said. ``I kept the pressure on, and it paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   Philippoussis finished with 30 aces, the fastest at 132 miles
per hour. Johansson had 20 aces _ and drilled one 136 _ but also
had 15 double faults to Philippoussis's seven.
</P>
<P>
   There was little to choose between Philippoussis and Johansson
in the first four sets, and they finally got down to business in
the fifth. Especially late in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.2l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It was 4-4, Johansson was serving, and quickly, it was 0-40. He
climbed out of that hole. Two more times Philippoussis had break
points, and Johansson, with some great passing shots, held off each
one. Four times Johansson had game point and couldn't put it away.
Finally, on Johansson's fifth game point, Philippoussis, who had
some great volleys, hit one into the net.
</P>
<P>
   Soon they were in the tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   Larsson never had a chance against Moya. Only once did he have a
break point on Moya's service, and the No. 10 seed served himself
out of trouble in that game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just took better care of the ball than I,'' Larsson said.
``It's easy. I made a lot of errors in the beginning. Then I
started thinking about the swing, got too careful, and still
missed. It was not a good day.''
</P>
<P>
   Moya, 22, knows a little about those. He won his first Slam
title at the French Open in the spring, went out in the second
round at Wimbledon, then began to struggle as this tournament
approached.
</P>
<P>
   He lost to Paul Haarhuis in the first round of a smaller tour
clay-court event in Croatia where he was the No. 1 seed. Then he
moved on to hard courts and the hard times continued. He lost his
first match in Cincinnati to Jerome Golmard, his first in
Indianapolis to Johansson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no confidence at all,'' Moya said. ``I thought I cannot
beat anyone the way I was playing.''
</P>
<P>
   He got here and things started to turn.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Puerta had worked his way back into their first-round
match but then had to retire with severe leg cramps at 6-1, 7-6
(7-4), 6-7 (3-7), 4-4. Moya helped carry him off the court.
</P>
<P>
   He's been escorting players off the court since. He lost the
first two sets, 6-3, 6-1, to Michael Chang and was in big trouble.
He fought off three match points and came back to beat Chang, who
simply doesn't lose five-set matches.
</P>
<P>
   Next was up-and-coming American Jan-Michael Gambill. Gambill was
up a break and serving at 4-3 and 40-15 in the fifth set, and Moya
escaped that one, too.
</P>
<P>
   Moya, who lost in the first round here last year and in the
second the previous year, hasn't dropped a set in his last two
matches.
</P>
<P>
   He's renewed and ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you a lot of power,'' Moya said. ``You think that
nobody can beat you right now because they didn't do it before.''
</P>
<P>
   Moya took exactly 90 minutes to put Larsson away. He used his
chances to break efficiently. He had two break points in the first
set and used one for the only break he needed. In the second set,
he had two more break points and pounced on both.
</P>
<P>
   Larsson wiggled free of a couple of break points early in the
third set, but then came the eighth game. Moya had two more break
points, and Larsson survived those, too. He couldn't escape the
third, and when his forehand went wide, Moya had the break and a
5-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   He served out the match, ending it with his only ace of the day.

EXPECT SKELETONS TO EXIT THEIR CLOSETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIANNE FLYNN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the climate on Capitol Hill gets superheated by
revelations in the independent counsel's report on President
Clinton, expect a few members of Congress to sweat.
</P>
<P>
   They'd be the ones with something in their background they'd
rather leave there.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton allies reportedly have indulged in a diversionary
strategy of leaking information about past peccadilloes of members
of Congress charged with investigating allegations against the
president that may lead to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy may have been behind the confession published
Thursday in the ``Idaho Statesman'' by U.S. Rep. Helen Chenoweth,
R-Idaho, that during the 1980s she had a six-year affair with a
married man. It ended 14 years ago. Chenoweth, an archconservative
known for her support of the militia movement, had made Christian
family values the theme of her election campaign and now her
re-election. She had just begun running a series of campaign ads
saying, in part, ``President Clinton's behavior has severely
damaged his ability to lead our nation and the free world.''
</P>
<P>
   Chenoweth's spokesman said he didn't know where the
``Statesman''an got the story, and he declined to speculate.
</P>
<P>
   Payback was almost assuredly behind last month's false
statements that Rep. Paul McHale, D-Pa., who was the first
congressman in the president's party to call for his resignation,
lied about his war record. The White House apologized to McHale for
the erroneous leak that news personality Geraldo Rivera said came
from a Clinton staff member. Rivera apologized, too.
</P>
<P>
   McHale declined through a spokeswoman Thursday to further
discuss the incident.
</P>
<P>
   And disgraced Clinton political strategist Dick Morris told a
Fox News talk-show audience on Tuesday that smear tactics were
behind the admission last week by Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., who led
the House investigation into questionable campaign finance
practices by the 1996 Clinton campaign, that Burton had an
extramarital affair and fathered an out-of-wedlock child.
</P>
<P>
   ``When will those people in the White House understand that they
cannot save this president by destroying the reputations of
innocent people? When will they get it?'' Morris said during the
Tuesday show on Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona members of Congress are among those looking over their
shoulders, knowing that allegations could be made against them at
any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter whether it's true or untrue,'' said Rep.
John Shadegg, R-Ariz. ``That's the way it is around here. That is
the way the White House has operated from the get-go.''
</P>
<P>
   Any outspoken conservative is a target, Shadegg said. Shadegg
was the victim of a whisper campaign in his first term, but that
was blamed on fellow Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't doubt for a second that it (smear tactics) would
get much worse and get much uglier,'' Shadegg said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.D. Hayworth, R-Ariz., who is locked in a tight
re-election battle with a Democrat with ties to the White House,
agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the way the president and his people have attempted to
destroy (presidential critics) Paula Jones, Billy Dale, Kathleen
Willey, Ken Starr and anyone else who has raised questions about
wrongdoing in this White House, it is likely that this pattern of
abuse continues and that members of Congress could now be targets
of a smear campaign orchestrated out of the White House,'' Hayworth
said.
</P>
<P>
   If evidence of such a strategy of going after House members is
discovered, Arizona Republican Rep. Matt Salmon said, it should be
added to the impeachable offenses listed by independent counsel
Kenneth Starr in his report.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's jury tampering, plain and simple,'' Salmon said. ``That
is a very, very serious obstruction of justice.'' &QL;

CUBS DEFEAT PIRATES; SOSA FAILS TO CONNECT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BILL DEDMAN

<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Baseball Hall of Fame has a display case with Mark
McGwire's bat, ball, jersey, spikes, everything but his socks and
underwear. The question is, will Sammy Sosa still have his uniform
when the season ends?
</P>
<P>
   Sosa remained at 58 home runs on Thursday, with 16 games
remaining. He went 0 for 3, during the Cubs' 4-2 victory over the
Pirates at Wrigley Field; the triumph snapped a three-game losing
streak. Jason Schmidt (11-11) walked Sosa in his first at-bat and
Mark Grace followed with a a three-run homer, his 15th of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Following Sosa's every move now is a representative of the
Baseball Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll stay with Sosa until he hits 62, at least,'' said John
Ralph, director of communications and programming for the Hall. The
Hall has Sosa's bat from his 57th homer, which set a Cubs record
and passed Hack Wilson's old National League record, and a bat from
his record-setting June. Sosa was welcomed with a standing ovation
by 34,857 fans at Wrigley. ``McGwire who?'' said one sign. Sosa
walked, grounded out twice and struck out swinging.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa said he wasn't trying too hard. ``I'll just take what
happens,'' he said. ``I'm not thinking about it. I know if I don't
think about it and have the same fun I've been having all season,
it'll happen for me.''

IN NASCAR, GORDON'S FEATS ARE RUTHIAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL SCHLOTTER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If anybody in America is doing anything as well as
Mark McGwire is hitting a baseball, it has to be NASCAR Winston Cup
points leader Jeff Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   While McGwire has been pounding his way into baseball's record
books, Gordon has been chipping away at NASCAR's all-time bests as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon heads to Saturday's Exide NASCAR Select Batteries 400 in
Richmond, Va., the winner of six of the tour's last seven races and
seven of its last nine.
</P>
<P>
   He was third and fifth in his non-winning runs.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's victory at the Southern 500 was his 10th this year,
the third straight year he has won 10 or more races.
</P>
<P>
   The victory puts Gordon on the threshold of challenging Richard
Petty's modern-era record of 13 victories in a season, set in 1975.
(Petty won 27 races in 1967, five years before the accepted
beginning of NASCAR's modern era in 1972.)
</P>
<P>
   With nine races remaining, Gordon certainly has a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike McGwire, Gordon says beating Petty's record has not been
on his mind. ``I wasn't thinking about 10 (victories), so how can I
be thinking about 13,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he isn't. But from now until the season ends or the mark
becomes impossible, the rest of us will be.
</P>
<P>
   Team building: Chatsworth products Mike and Robbie Groff hope to
put together a two-car Indy Racing League team for next season.
</P>
<P>
   And the brothers say they're well on the way, with crews and
cars lined up and themselves _ both IRL veterans _ ready to drive.
</P>
<P>
   This missing ingredient? What else but money?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely looking for potential business partners,''
said Robbie. ``We've pretty much got everything in place, we just
need a few more business partners.''
</P>
<P>
   Cost of the venture will run about $6 million, Robbie Groff
said.
</P>
<P>
   Both brothers have driven in IRL and CART races. Mike led the
1997 IRL points race for a while before falling behind after a
series of crashes and injuries. He ran in the top 10 this season
before parting company with Jonathan Byrd Racing earlier this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Zanardi wins it: Alex Zanardi's fourth place at last weekend's
Molson Indy Vancouver clinched the second straight Champ car title
for the Italian driver.
</P>
<P>
   The colorful and frank Zanardi said he will probably announce
his 1999 driving plans next week. It is widely believed he will
drive on the Formula One circuit next season.
</P>
<P>
   In the fold: While Zanardi contemplates his future, Target Chip
Ganassi Racing re-signed his teammate Jimmy Vasser to a three-year
deal.
</P>
<P>
   With Vasser's 1996 title, Ganassi Racing has the last three
Champ car championships.
</P>
<P>
   And another one gone...: In its struggle to compete with the
FedEx Championship Series and its big-name drivers, the Indy Racing
League has had some success developing its own stars.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, it seems as soon as those drivers make themselves known,
they jump ship for other circuits.
</P>
<P>
   The IRL has already lost Tony Stewart to NASCAR's Winston Cup
circuit next season.
</P>
<P>
   And now it is rumored that Kenny Brack, winner of the circuit's
last three races and its current points leader, is being courted by
the Arciero-Well team of the rival FedEx circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Moving out: Steve Portenga's victory at the L.A. Street Race
Kragen Z-One 200 increased his lead in NASCAR's Featherlite
Southwest Tour to 133 points.
</P>
<P>
   Tied for second are Granada Hills' M.K. Kanke and Colorado's
John Metcalf. Four races remain.
</P>
<P>
   Irwindale update: Construction is on schedule at the new
Irwindale Speedway, and the new track has released a schedule of 60
weekend racing dates for 1999.
</P>
<P>

YANKEES TOP BLUE JAYS, 8-5 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Joe Torre began answering questions about his
playoff rotation a month ago, it seemed he would have to carefully
pick three starters from a group of five. But with the post-season
less than three weeks away, Torre, the New York Yankee manager, may
find himself settling, or hoping, for mediocrity from his third
starter.
</P>
<P>
   Hideki Irabu and Orlando Hernandez each turned in hugely
disappointing starts this week, and on Thursday night Andy Pettitte
struggled mightily while battling for six innings and picking up
his 16th victory in the Yankees' 8-5 victory against the Toronto
Blue Jays, before 25,881 at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill, who hit two home runs on Wednesday night in
Boston, blasted two more on Thursday night for the Yankees
(103-41), whose 21-game lead is the largest in the history of the
franchise. Toronto (78-68) is hanging on the fringe of the American
League wild-card race, five games behind the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   David Wells and David Cone, two Cy Young Award candidates, will
pitch in the division series that starts Sept. 29. But Irabu is
having a crisis of confidence, his nasty fastball and forkball
abandoning him any time he leaves the bullpen. Hernandez nearly
blew a 5-0 lead on Wednesday, his stubbornness getting the better
of him, as he insisted on trying to hit the corners with perfect
pitches and ended up issuing walks.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte (16-9) may be the most mysterious case of all. A
fighter of great intensity, Pettitte can take heart in the fact
that he allowed runs in only one of six innings on Thursday night,
and he scrapped and worked and labored to hold down the Blue Jays,
shutting them out for his final four innings. ``He got a little bit
better as he was going along,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   But the end result could have been far, far worse. Pettitte
appeared to have little zip on his fastball, and his breaking ball
was poor. Three times he spun his slider three or four feet in
front of home plate, possibly confirming what Torre believes: that
Pettitte may be trying too hard and not throwing freely and
loosely. ``I scuffled through it again,'' Pettitte acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   His command was awful. Pettitte needed 97 pitches to get through
the first five innings, and he fell behind in the count to 16 of
the 27 batters he faced, reaching three-ball counts with 11
batters. When he did throw strikes, he did not fool anybody: he
threw 106 pitches, and the Toronto batters swung and missed 6
times. Scouts who watched Pettitte pitch against Chicago last
weekend clocked his fastball at about 87 miles an hour, which the
Yankees say is simply not an accurate reflection of how hard
Pettitte has been throwing this summer. But Pettitte's stuff was
subpar, and he was very lucky.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays had runners at first and third and nobody out in
the first inning when Pettitte picked off Shawn Green, killing the
rally. Toronto had runners on first and second and one out in the
third when Craig Grebeck smashed a wicked liner to first baseman
Tino Martinez, who speared the ball and tagged the runner for a
double play. Pettitte escaped another rally in the fifth with the
help of a double play ball.
</P>
<P>
   He battled _ he always battles _ and after Toronto scored five
runs in the top of the second, Pettitte held the Blue Jays by
throwing more sinking fastballs and throwing them aggressively,
giving the Yankees time to rebound from the 5-2 deficit against Pat
Hentgen. The Yankees scored a run in the second and four more in
the third, and O'Neill capped off their scoring with his second
home run, in the fourth.

DODGERS' YOUNG: I WAS ROBBED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The Dodgers' postgame clubhouse was a raucous place
Thursday afternoon, and no one was louder than Eric Young, who
thought he broke up Kevin Brown's perfect game to open the top of
the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Young hit a slow roller to third and appeared to beat George
Arias' throw, which sailed past Padres first baseman Wally Joyner.
A hit went up on the scoreboard and the crowd of 26,018 booed.
</P>
<P>
   But after nearly a minute, official scorer Bill Zavestoski
called the play an error, saying Joyner never had a chance to catch
Arias' throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't even close,'' Young bellowed. ``You saw me laughing
on the field, but you tell me that wasn't a hit. Everyone in the
stadium knew it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what was at stake with the way he was pitching. But
come on.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Young had a base hit taken away when Brown caught a
vicious line drive to open the fourth inning. And the Dodgers
rallied that inning to score four runs and beat the Padres 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   But Young was upset because he thought he was undone by a scorer
trying to protect a no-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand about the moment and all that,'' Young said,
``but look at where I was and look at where the ball was.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Bobby Bonilla said, ``What do you think they would have
called the play if Tony Gwynn was at the plate?''
</P>
<P>
   Young remained upset for several minutes until Eric Karros, who
got the first official hit two batters later with a high chopper to
third, jokingly questioned Young's team concept. ``Hey E.Y., why
don't you tell us what you thought of the 4-3 victory?''
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: By striking out 11 Dodgers, Brown set a Padres
record for strikeouts in a season (238). Clay Kirby held the record
with 231 in 1971.... The Padres' magic number to clinch the NL West
remained at four. Any combination of San Diego victories and San
Francisco losses totaling four will give the Padres the title....
Padres third baseman Ken Caminiti, 1996 NL MVP, was scratched with
a sore lower back. The Padres already are playing without Tony
Gwynn (chipped right thumb), who will be out a week to 10 days....
Seven innings by Chan Ho Park marked the 11th time in the last 12
games a Dodgers starter has gone that far.... Bobby Bonilla's
bases-loaded single in the seventh inning could have been a double,
but Karros had to wait to see if the two runners in front of him
would score.... Jeff Shaw struck out the side in the ninth to
record his 42nd save, matching last year's total when he pitched
for the Cincinnati Reds.... Damon Hollins, an outfielder acquired
Wednesday from the Atlanta Braves, joined the club Thursday and
became the 52nd player to wear a Dodgers uniform this year, a Los
Angeles team record.

ANGELS LEARN TO FLY WITH BROKEN WINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Resilience isn't easily achieved in baseball.
As with the hitting of a curveball, only practice makes perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why the Angels are contending for a division title
despite having suffered a wide-ranging and potentially devastating
array of major injuries.
</P>
<P>
   This club has made 22 disabled-list moves this season, a
franchise record. Through significant portions of June and July, it
had to get along without three-fifths of its starting rotation. And
five members of its projected starting lineup have combined to
spend 315 days off the active roster.
</P>
<P>
   The general response to all of this? A collective shrug. And a
two-game lead in the American League West with 17 to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone through this type of stuff before, so you learn how
to deal with it,'' said shortstop Gary DiSarcina, one of the
veteran leaders on the team. ``In the past, we haven't dealt with
it in the proper fashion. This year, we've done a tremendous job of
blocking it out.''
</P>
<P>
   There's little disputing that the Angels have handled setbacks
abysmally in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, they suffered one of the most ignominious stretch-drive
collapses in major-league history, suffering 31 losses over their
final 49 games after holding an 11-game lead in the West on Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the crash was widely attributed to the loss of one
man, DiSarcina, who mangled his left thumb the first week of
August. He might have been the Angels' infield commander, but he
was also their No. 9 hitter. The team reacted as if the heart of
its lineup had been carved out.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Angels were in first place, a half-game up, on
Aug. 15. But over the next four days, pitcher Chuck Finley and
catcher Todd Greene broke their wrists and leadoff man Tony
Phillips was suspended in the wake of a drug arrest. Within a
month, the Angels were six games out of the running; the season was
lost.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Terry Collins wasn't around for the '95 debacle, but he
suffered through the unraveling that occurred last year. So, when
the broken bodies began piling up early this season, he was
determined to head off a recurrence.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of May, the Angels lost starters Jack McDowell and
Allen Watson to elbow soreness, and second baseman Randy Velarde's
return from the disabled list had lasted an entire day before he
reinjured his right arm. Matters looked bleak as the Angels
prepared to open a series in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Collins convened a clubhouse meeting. He recalls: ``We said,
`Hey, if there's anybody in here who doesn't think you're good
enough, you'd better come in now, because we're going to war,
starting tonight.'
</P>
<P>
   ``From that point on, they just picked it up. They played hard.
That was a series we ended up coming back from five runs down in
the ninth to win. And they've just never let up since.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels embarked on a stretch in which they won 22 of 27
games. It set an unmistakable tone for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players on this team learn to play hard and move on,'' said
center fielder Jim Edmonds. ``Usually, teams fold. Well, it's not
that they fold, but you take one key component out of the
lineup...'' He didn't finish, perhaps because the topic cuts a
little too close to home.
</P>
<P>
   The list of absent Angels in '98 has been staggering in its
length.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the losses of McDowell and Watson, premier
starter Ken Hill was out for 2{ months after having bone chips
removed from his elbow. And now he's contending with a bruised
hand, the result of an encounter with a sharply batted ball
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   As for position players, the Angels have had to plug holes at
first base, second base, third base, catcher and right field, the
result of disabling injuries to Darin Erstad (hamstring), Velarde
(elbow, forearm), Dave Hollins (shoulder), Greene (shoulder) and
Tim Salmon (foot).
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget valuable setup reliever Mike James, who has
been limited to 14 innings because of a halting recovery from Tommy
John surgery on his right arm.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' ability to avoid being devastated by these losses
can be tied to a wide variety of explanations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too much attention has been paid to it being some miracle,''
said general manager Bill Bavasi.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, clearly, has been a steadying influence, particularly
when the Angels plunged into a slump in July. ``For me, it's easy
to judge a guy when his team is winning,'' said Bavasi. ``... He
was tremendous when we were struggling. He hung in there. He didn't
lose his cool. He didn't get his head down.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, several players have done a commendable if unspectacular
job of plugging gaps. The unlikely pitching trio of Steve Sparks,
Jarrod Washburn and Omar Olivares, for example, stepped in for the
missing starters and combined to win 21 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it had to do with the veterans,'' said Justin
Baughman, who was rushed to the big leagues (he played at Single-A
last year) to fill in for Velarde at second base. ``They knew I had
to help, but I was a rookie, and they didn't expect much of me.
They made me feel like I belonged, and that helped me relax.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Collins: ``We still have our core guys who have to get it
done for us. DiSar(cina) can go to Chris Pritchett and say,
`Pritch, I know you're playing first base. It might be an offensive
position. But don't try to carry us. Just do what you can do.'''
</P>
<P>
   Established players have also done a solid job picking up slack,
notably Edmonds, DiSarcina, Garret Anderson and even Salmon, who is
finishing the season with a partially torn ligament in his left
foot.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' cause has been further aided by their positioning in
the second-weakest division in the major leagues. The AL Central is
the only other division in which they could hope to occupy first
place with a .552 winning percentage.
</P>
<P>
   But the Angels have faltered in this very division in the past
when trouble visited them. They've averted it this season _ at
least through 145 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like guys have grown accustomed to ignoring it,''
DiSarcina said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to learn from it,'' Collins said of the past
experiences. ``You've got to learn how to play over the tough
times. They know that either they play over it or they're in
trouble.'' &QL;

A FAN'S DELIGHT: McNOWN VS. WILLIAMS 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Heismania, catch it while you can. The pop top on
the can of hype that bears the Heisman Trophy label was wrested
opened so many weeks ago, you have to wonder if the candidacy of
either Ricky Williams or Cade McNown could fizzle as famously as
New Coke by sundown Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Ricky and Cade, I don't believe the one who loses the
football game will be out of the (Heisman) race as long as he
performs well,'' said UCLA coach Bob Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, and a thirsty world will drink any syrupy
concoction as long as it tastes good.
</P>
<P>
   No matter the aftertaste, it'll be refreshing to see Williams,
the resplendent senior running back for Texas, and McNown, the
resilient senior quarterback for UCLA, sharing the same Rose Bowl
stage Saturday afternoon. The top two returning Heisman Trophy vote
getters don't often meet away from the awards banquet circuit. How
delicious that for one afternoon college football fans could be the
ones treated to quite a feast.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, fifth in the 1997 balloting for college football's
most coveted award, faces a UCLA defense that lost seven starters
off the unit that held him to 36 yards in a 66-3 Bruins rout last
year. McNown, eighth in the voting, is going up against a Texas
defense that yielded 483 yards to New Mexico State last week in the
Longhorns' season-opening win.
</P>
<P>
   The table has been set. Heisman voters, though, are nothing if
not as persnickety as Miss Manners, meaning Williams and McNown
ought to carefully mind their X's and O's. Peyton Manning had a
quiet outing against Florida last year and the Heisman Trophy that
was all but his went home instead with Michigan junior cornerback
Charles Woodson.
</P>
<P>
   Woodson would have been a senior preparing for Syracuse right
now if he hadn't bolted to the NFL. Ryan Leaf, the third-place
finisher in last year's balloting, also bypassed his senior year
for the pros. The game between the Longhorns and the Bruins would
have been drained of much of its color had Williams and McNown
followed the herd instead of their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, an estimated crowd of 85,000 is expected to pump up
the proceedings, adding to the vibrancy of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can start with a more exciting opener,''
Toledo said. ``I'd like to just sit in the stands and watch this
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns are looking to avenge last year's blowout while
the Bruins are bent on extending a 10-game winning streak that
started in Austin. McNown, a four-year starter, was in a zone of
his own during that span, completing 60.9 percent of his passes for
22 touchdowns against four interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   He ended his junior campaign with the highest quarterback rating
in the country (168.6). He passed for a school-record 3,116 yards
and 24 touchdowns to evoke the name of ex-Bruins great Troy Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   When people talk about Williams, the conversation invariably
turns to former Longhorn and Houston Oilers star Earl Campbell. One
more 100-yard rushing game and Williams, the nation's leading
runner last year, will tie Campbell's 21-year-old school record of
20. After opening his senior season with a 215-yard performance
against New Mexico State, Williams is within 74 yards of eclipsing
Campbell as the school's all-time leading rusher.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Dorsett's NCAA career mark of 6,082 yards also is well
within the reach of Williams, who is harder to grasp than quantum
physics. Consider: 63.8 percent of his 4,370 rushing yards have
come after the initial contact.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be around Williams or McNown long to realize
they're also special in ways that can't be measured. They're so
square they're geometric, which beats egocentric any day.
</P>
<P>
   McNown, a B-plus student in history, doesn't swear or drink. He
speaks at church services while so many other kids his age are
sleeping off hangovers. Williams, too, is 21 going on 64.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't worry about getting goaded into drunken brawls in
bars because he doesn't frequent them. He also doesn't swear. He
used part of the signing bonus he received after being drafted by
the Philadelphia Phillies to put his twin sister and another sister
through college.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder that when they first met, at an elite football
gathering in Orlando, they hit it off?
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect people who shrug off the pressure and who don't get
caught up in themselves when they get a lot of attention,'' said
McNown, who never met a glad-hander he didn't eye warily.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're around people who are always greasing you, you're in
for a rude awakening when mean things are said about you,'' McNown
said.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what happens every Saturday from here on out, you
get the feeling Williams and McNown will sparkle long after the
fizz is off the hype. &QL;

MADONNA DOMINATES MTV BASH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIVERSAL CITY _ It was Madonna's kind of night at the 15th
annual MTV Video Music Awards, where the Material Mom won six
trophies including video of the year for ``Ray of Light.''
</P>
<P>
   Madonna, who was nominated in nine categories Thursday, was the
big winner by far at the often outrageous awards show, presented by
the cable music network.
</P>
<P>
   Actor-rapper Will Smith, Boston rockers Aerosmith and British
techno band Prodigy each won two awards.
</P>
<P>
   Along with video of the year, Madonna got the nod for best
female video, best direction in a video, best choreography, best
special effects in a video and best editing in a video.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she performed the winning song, ``Ray of Light,''
with rocker Lenny Kravitz in front of the packed house at the
Universal Amphitheatre. At first dressed as a Gothic librarian in a
black gown, Madonna then threw off her outfit, revealing a
provocatively sheer white T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Backstage, the often controversial, Michigan-born pop superstar
answered reporters' questions in a brand-new, upper-crust British
accent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more interested in inspiring people than shocking
people,'' said the singer, born Madonna Louise Veronica Ciccone.
</P>
<P>
   Smith received the best male video nod for ``Just the Two of
Us'' and best rap video for ``Gettin' Jiggy Wit' It.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said backstage that at home, he likes to make up love
songs to his wife, actress Jada Pinkett Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``She thinks I can't sing,'' he said, ``so I might even try that
on my next album.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there's anything he isn't good at, the actor, comedian
and rapper quipped, ``I don't know, but I'll call you when I find
it, baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Aerosmith's ``Pink'' was voted best rock video, while the band's
current No.1 hit, ``I Don't Want to Miss a Thing'' from the movie
``Armageddon,'' was named best video from a film.
</P>
<P>
   The Backstreet Boys' ``Everybody (Backstreet's Back)'' was voted
best group video. Green Day's ``Time of Your Life (Good Riddance)''
got the nod for best alternative music video.
</P>
<P>
   Wyclef Jean's ``Gone Till November'' won for best R&AMP;B clip,
while Australian soap star turned singer Natalie Imbruglia was
voted best new artist in a video for ``Torn.''
</P>
<P>
   Prodigy's ``Smack My Bitch Up'' was named best dance video of
the year and breakthrough video of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Beastie Boys, who will perform two sold-out shows at the
Forum tonight and Saturday, received the Video Vanguard award for
outstanding contributions to the medium.
</P>
<P>
   The colorful show, hosted by ``There's Something About Mary''
star Ben Stiller, featured performances from a host of music stars,
including Courtney Love's band, Hole; the Brian Setzer Orchestra;
Marilyn Manson; the Beastie Boys; Master P; and the Dave Matthews
Band.
</P>
<P>
   Backstage, the glamorous and outspoken Love blasted bad reviews
of her new album, ``Celebrity Skin,'' which was released this week.
She said there were only three negative reviews of the record, and
they were ``all personal.''
</P>
<P>
   Pop-R&AMP;B divas Brandy and Monica dueted on their chart-topper
``The Boy Is Mine'' for the first time on stage.
</P>
<P>
   The cable music network's annual awards show was staged in Los
Angeles rather than New York for the first time in five years. The
program consistently ranks among cable television's top-rated
awards shows.
</P>
<P>
   Presenters included Beck, Whitney Houston, Jennifer Lopez, Val
Kilmer, Hanson, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Tori Amos and ``South Park''
creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone.

HEISMAN HOPEFUL WILLIAMS HOOKED ON 'HORNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When he stepped to the dais before a packed conference room, the
eyes of Texas were on Ricky Williams.
</P>
<P>
   And so were their hopes and dreams.
</P>
<P>
   When Williams _ after dropping hints that he was staying, then
leaving, then staying _ announced Jan. 8 he would not enter the NFL
draft, the room erupted as if a new shopping mall were coming to
town.
</P>
<P>
   There were screams, hugs and high-fives all around. It was a
scene that was soon repeated across the state. University of Texas
fans were so giddy about their good fortune that a record 21,000
attended the spring game.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' return, along with the hiring of coach Mack Brown, has
rejuvenated Texas football after last year's 4-7 season.
</P>
<P>
   There is talk of Williams winning the Heisman and breaking Tony
Dorsett's NCAA career rushing record. And, if the Longhorns can
beat No.6 UCLA this week and win at No.5 Kansas State next week,
they can start setting their sights on a Halloween game at
Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   All this fuss, though, is lost on Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially,'' said Williams, a native of San Diego, ``I
haven't really thought about it.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is the essence of Williams. He doesn't pay much
attention to what everyone else thinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Ricky, nothing that he does really surprises me as far as
making a decision,'' said his mother, Sandy Williams. ``He just
kind of does what makes himself feel comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes his steadfast refusal to cut the dreadlocks he's
worn since he was 13. There is also the Mickey Mouse tattoo on his
shoulder and the dagger on his chest. And he doesn't speak with a
forked tongue, but with a pierced one.
</P>
<P>
   Williams continues to play minor-league baseball for the
Philadelphia Phillies even though his future is clearly in
football. While he grew up dreaming about playing at USC like his
idol _ San Diego native Marcus Allen _ he turned down the Trojans'
scholarship offer.
</P>
<P>
   So if it was hard for most people to understand why Williams
turned down a chance to go to the NFL and sign a $3.6-million bonus
like the one awarded Curtis Enis, the first running back chosen in
this year's draft, there's at least one person who wasn't
surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really enjoys playing here,'' said his mother. ``He has a
chance to experience that for another year, so why rush it? It's a
good time in his life. Just because he's a good player, why should
he cut his college experience short?''
</P>
<P>
   For once, Ricky Williams is not having to grow up too fast.
</P>
<P>
   He was the man of the house at age 5, when Sandy and Errick
Williams, Ricky's father, split up, leaving Sandy with Ricky, his
twin sister Cassie, and his younger sister Nicey. Ricky, as a
6-year-old, was in charge while his mother spent evenings at
school.
</P>
<P>
   When the Phillies made Williams an eighth-round draft pick out
of high school, he signed for a $50,000 bonus and used the money to
move his mother to Texas _ first to Houston, two hours away, and
then to Austin. He helped pay for Cassie's schooling, first at
Southeastern Louisiana and then at Texas. Nicey is now a freshman
at Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't, `Mom, if you move I'll pay for it,''' said Sandy,
who works as a buyer for a software company in Austin. ``When he
came out here, he said, `Mom, you'd really like it, 'cause it's
green and there's the country scenery.' I visited and stayed. He
gave me money to handle the move and made sure I was set up in my
apartment before he got set up in his dorm.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for Cassie's tuition, we were just talking one day and her
bill, being an out-of-state student, was higher than I anticipated.
Ricky asked for the bill. He wrote a check for it and gave me money
for the next semester. His sisters both wanted to go back to San
Diego for Christmas the first year they were out here, so he bought
their tickets. That's just Ricky.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who is 6-foot-1, 225 pounds, was a unanimous Best in
the West choice after leading Patrick Henry High to the CIF-San
Diego Section title game in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   That autumn, Williams and his best friend, Chad Patmon, now his
teammate and roommate at Texas, would drive to Los Angeles on
Saturdays where they were guests of UCLA and USC. Sometimes they
would see two games in a day.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Moses, then UCLA's running backs coach, visited Williams'
home, but Williams' interest in the Bruins ceased as soon they
asked him about playing linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   He took a recruiting trip to USC that January, then left the
next day to visit Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was this dreadlocked kid who we heard was pretty good, but
we thought he was going to USC,'' said Texas guard Ben Adams, a
fifth-year senior from La Mirada. ``Me, (center) Russell Gaskamp
and a couple of others were having breakfast with him and somebody
asked him what he was going to do. He said he was going to come
here. It was a shock because that's the cardinal rule: never commit
on a recruiting trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was smitten with Austin, a liberal bastion in Texas
with a small-city feel like San Diego, and it was hard to hide. ``I
didn't hear from him once when he went to USC,'' said Sandy. ``I
heard from him four times the first day he was at Texas. I knew
right then.''
</P>
<P>
   It also helped that USC appeared stacked at tailback at the
time, with Shawn Walters, Delon Washington, Leonard Green and
LaVale Woods. Nobody at Texas asked him to play defense and nobody
mentioned redshirting.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big thing for me was getting a chance to play a lot,''
Williams said. ``(USC) coach (John) Robinson said I would, but it
was hard for me to believe him.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, living in a state where pee-wee football highlights
are televised, has few private moments. He lives just off Sixth
Street, the city's renowned restaurant and entertainment strip, but
says he rarely ventures there.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see too many 6-foot-1, 225-pound guys walking around
town with dreadlocks,'' said Patmon, who has known Williams since
the ninth grade. ``People see him and go, `Hey, it's Ricky
Williams.' It's almost like Shaquille O'Neal in L.A. Ricky's the
main guy here.''
</P>
<P>
   In last Saturday's season opener, Williams was able to get
through the New Mexico State defense for 215 yards and a
school-record six touchdowns. The Longhorns won 66-36.
</P>
<P>
   He returns Saturday to play football in Southern California for
the first time since he left. His mother flew to San Diego
Wednesday and will drive up with about 20 relatives. A cadre of
Patrick Henry players are also coming; another alum, freshman nose
guard Ken Kocher, plays for UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   It's a chance for Williams to play for them, to play for the
Heisman against UCLA quarterback Cade McNown, and also a chance to
right the wrong of last year's 66-3 loss to the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   It's an opportunity that money can't buy.

CLOSE FRIENDS HAVE MANY DIFFERENCES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MINEO  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, N.C. _ Probably the two most famous bass fishermen in
the world, Roland Martin and Jimmy Houston, are two sides of the
same highly competitive, larger-than-life coin.
</P>
<P>
   As an observer during the BASS Masters Classic staged last month
in Lexington, N.C., I rode with Houston the first day of the
competition and Martin the second. The two anglers are close
friends and household names in bass-savvy sections of the country,
but they displayed vastly different competition and lifestyle
philosophies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston runs a half-dozen businesses, produces and stars in 52
television shows a year, makes more than 75 personal appearances
and considers his whistle-stops on the professional bass circuit
``vacations.''
</P>
<P>
   His approach to tournament fishing is basic. ``You catch a limit
every day, you're going to do good. You don't. You don't,'' said
the towheaded Cookson, Okla., angler with the distinctive Dutch boy
haircut. ``The beauty of this sport is you don't need physical
talent; the skill can be developed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing is this crowd (the Classic's contenders) ... so
many of them catch them every day, it's tough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, who holds a degree in economics and political science
from Oklahoma's Northeastern University, believes success in life
is ``just being willing to take risks. You don't take 'em, you get
nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his possessions are the largest Ranger, Tracker and Nitro
boat dealership in Oklahoma, a travel agency, a television
production company, a 6,000-square-foot sporting goods store, a
service station, a driving range, a miniature golf course and what
he calls a hybrid between a convenience store and a supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   His goal in starting and owning so many businesses was not to
have the spectacular financial success he has achieved but to
``selfishly to keep my kids close.'' He has carved out careers for
his two children and an ``adopted'' nephew, who he has raised
almost since birth.
</P>
<P>
   What do you pay your own kids working for you? ``You pay 'em
what they're worth,'' he said without hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   Along with his business sensibilities come strong religious
convictions. Emblazoned above the gaudy manufacturers' logos on the
back of his fishing shirt is a verse from the Bible, Psalms 16:8 _
``I have set the Lord always before me.'' His collar reads, ``Jesus
First.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston complained prayer wasn't a sufficient part of the BASS
Masters Classic. ``Where would we be if we took God out of the
tournament?'' he asked. He never mentioned it during our day on the
water, but all of his tournament winnings are pledged to his
church-building fund.
</P>
<P>
   And there are usually plenty of winnings for the man who was
deemed the best of the best in 1976 and 1986 as B.A.S.S. Angler of
the Year.
</P>
<P>
   In the Classic, he targeted an area where previous tournaments
had been won. Casts were made with a casual precision. Houston
would go on to finish well out of the money ... but had me
questioning whether I was attending church frequently enough. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Roland Martin was a study in contrast, the Bret Maverick of the
tournament trail _ boyish, engaging, always on the edge and living
every minute of every day with charm and humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Always go by the rules, but do what you can do to win,'' said
the Clewiston, Fla., angler.
</P>
<P>
   He vowed after a poor showing the first day to ``just go out and
have fun.'' The pledge was negated immediately the second day,
however, with instinct taking over and Martin working every cast to
maximize his catch. Like Houston, Martin is best known for his
popular television show, but he has a remarkable nine B.A.S.S.
Angler of the Year titles to his credit dating from 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Forsaking fish habitats created by nature, Martin offered a
glimpse into his aforementioned fishing philosophy by planting 30
of his own brush piles (allowed by tournament rules) at strategic
points invisible to other Classic competitors. He was banking on
the proclivity of fish to seek his structure for shelter or ambush
potential and being the only angler to have the knowledge of its
location.
</P>
<P>
   Planting and fishing skill had to be matched with the ability to
locate each structure with no obvious clues above the waterline. He
carried a notebook with locations designated by references to
shoreline markers.
</P>
<P>
   At one point we slowly cruised to an area 300 feet off the
nearest shore and not in any way distinguishable from the miles of
water around us. ``I'm going to crawl this jig over my brush pile
on the first cast,'' Roland promised. I scoffed in silence, and he
knew it. He cast, snagged a branch, smiled, reeled in, threw the
limb back to me and continued fishing.
</P>
<P>
   During tourney week, Martin and Houston were besieged by
requests for autographs, on everything from baseball caps to canoe
paddles. Each graciously complied. From time to time, a spectator
would call Martin's familiar TV refrain _ ``Oh, son.'' He would
invariably look up and flash a grin to the camera he knew would be
clicking. It was an unconscious gesture, like a sneeze or a blink,
and he immediately returned to what he had been doing.
</P>
<P>
   Does he ever tire of the autograph seekers and picture takers?
``Well, yeah, sure,'' he mused, then thought again, smiled and
said, ``Heck no, I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Classic's second day, Martin went for bigger fish in an
attempt to get back in the tournament. He failed. No apologies were
considered; he weighed the risks and felt he had made the best
move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did what I needed to do, and it just didn't work,'' said
Martin.

HALF DOME NO EVEREST BUT NO CAKEWALK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERRY WOOD  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   YOSEMITE, Calif. _ Extreme climbers have Mount Everest. Average
Joe has Half Dome.
</P>
<P>
   It has come to this in the energy bar-munching,
pain-threshold-pushing 1990s: If you want to look your friends in
the eyes after a summertime visit to Yosemite National Park, you
had better say you made it to the top of Half Dome... and mean it.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks largely to the just-do-it/no-fear mind-set, summiting
8,842-foot Half Dome has become the grail pursued by Yosemite
Valley visitors who feel worthy of their lug-sole boots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without question, it is the most popular trail in the park,''
said Kendell Thompson, a spokesman for Yosemite National Park. ``A
lot of people may stop at the bridge below Vernal Falls, but a lot
of people still make the trip up to Half Dome. We don't have exact
numbers, but we know it's a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The day I made my first ascent, in 1980, I shared the waist-high
hand cables that line the route to provide better balance with six
people. Today, Half Dome seems to draw as many visitors as does the
Yosemite Village grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   The arduous day trip is 16 miles out and back, with a 4,800-foot
elevation gain. It includes a miserable set of precipitous,
sun-exposed switchbacks. At its most distant point is a final
gut-check: a 400-foot climb via the sometimes shaky cables up a
nearly 45-degree slope.
</P>
<P>
   To reach the top ostensibly validates a certain adventurous
spirit, authenticating outdoor worthiness in an Eco-Challenge, X
Games era. Otherwise, current logic dictates, you might as well be
wearing Bermuda shorts and black socks, scarfing designer ice cream
in Curry Village.
</P>
<P>
   Such perceptions, while generally legitimate, have a down side:
</P>
<P>
   They have turned the Half Dome route into one of the most
overpopulated day-use paths in the Sierra Nevada mountain chain.
They have pulverized it to fine sand in places. They have led to
huge snarls along the narrow traffic artery that ascends Half
Dome's steep north shoulder; from a distance, the string of humans
takes on the appearance of ants streaming along a sidewalk crack.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of being called a wimp or coward has created a
peer-pressure environment where unfit visitors and those
uncomfortable with heights have been talked into trying for the
summit, only to gas out well short of the goal or freeze part way
up the cables.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, this corridor has become so scuffed that sections
of granite are slick, adding an extra challenge to an already
difficult climb. (The last Half Dome death, ruled a suicide,
occurred in 1997.)
</P>
<P>
   What is a Yosemite visitor to do?
</P>
<P>
   Quiz yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Are you free of acrophobia? Can you accept inevitable encounters
with weekend warriors? Have you got the legs and the lungs for 16
serious miles?
</P>
<P>
   If so, do not pass up this trip, for it's a classic. Just do it
with wisdom. This is a no-nonsense hike best enjoyed after some
basic preparation. A few suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   Start early: Catch one of the first shuttle buses to Happy Isles
_ the starting point at Yosemite Valley's eastern end _ to do more
climbing in the cooler morning hours and not have to rush back down
to catch the last bus out to the car, tent or cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Carry ample water: A small spring exists along the Half Dome
Spur Trail, less than 2 miles from the summit, but unless a water
filter is used it is advised to avoid it. Also bring quick-energy
food.
</P>
<P>
   Gauge your stamina: If you're already pooped upon reaching the
footbridge at the top of Nevada Falls, about 3 miles in, turn back.
</P>
<P>
   Study the cables: They can be intimidating at first glance, even
if you feel no apprehension about heights. Gain assurance by
watching others. Bring work gloves; the cables are tough on tender
hands. Pause on the occasional two-by-four to rest. Invite faster
climbers to pass you; notify slow-pokes before you pass them.
</P>
<P>
   Select the best routes: Take the Mist Trail up; descend via the
longer John Muir Trail. This two-way option provides a pair of
splendid and entirely different views of striking Nevada Falls.
</P>
<P>
   A final option: Descending the John Muir Trail, watch for a
junction directing visitors to Clark Point and the Mist Trail. If
you have the energy to handle the extra three-quarters of a mile
this route will require, by all means, take it. The late-afternoon
view of Vernal Falls from lofty Clark Point is magnificent and
usually not crowded.
</P>
<P>
   If You're Going ...
</P>
<P>
   Plan on entering Yosemite Valley very early if you plan on
tackling Half Dome in the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Admission to Yosemite National Park is $20 per vehicle and is
good for seven consecutive days.
</P>
<P>
   The two primary day-use parking areas lie in the east valley, at
Curry Village and near the Yosemite Village Store. There is no time
limit on day-use parking, so long as the vehicle doesn't remain
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Walk or take one of the park's buses to shuttle stop No.16 to
start the hike at Happy Isles Nature Center. Apply sunscreen
liberally and drink at least two quarts of water en route to the
8,842-foot summit. If you feel faint or too weary to continue, turn
back; Half Dome will always be there for another attempt.
</P>
<P>

park's recorded-message line at (209) 372-0200, write to Yosemite
Association, Box 230, El Portal, CA 95318 or visit Yosemite's Web

SHERIFF'S PROGRAM HELPS YOUNGSTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH LAIR  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDUSTRY, Calif. _ Dennis Worden makes no excuses.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputy admits, some of the
high schoolers he tutors might join a gang or commit a crime in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   But Worden said he feels that offering options like the
Sheriff's High Adventure for At-Risk Kids (SHAARK) program will
steer impressionable teen-agers in the right direction. Each
summer, Worden and fellow volunteer deputies at the Industry
station teach free scuba courses to 40 participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our success is hard to gauge,'' said Worden, who has been a
certified diver for eight years and the SHAARK coordinator for the
past four. ``Will we see a change in these kids? Not really. Will
it cut crime? We don't know. But what we can do is show these kids
a great time and show that they can be successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can show that they can go out and do anything because
(scuba) is a major accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   The 8-year-old program is part of the Industry Sheriff's Youth
Athletic League; it is the only law enforcement-sponsored course of
its kind in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the patrol area _ from La Puente to Diamond Bar _
attend a trio of biweekly classes at the Industry Hills Aquatic
Center, where they practice in pools before graduating to 25- to
30-foot dives at Bird Rock and Two Harbors off Santa Catalina
Island. Participants must be able to show their swimming ability
and receive parental permission before taking part.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives the kids an opportunity for other fields, like
oceanography,'' said Gilda Roman of Hacienda Heights. Her two
daughters, Marissa and Danielle, participated in the July class.
``It's really a neat experience for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Watched over by four certified sheriff divers, the youths make
two dives in the Aquatic Center pool, the first to get acclimated
to the equipment and the second to the pool's bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hope is for them to overcome any fears they have and to
build trust,'' deputy Rico Rivera said. ``This is as close to a
police officer many will get. This shows that law enforcement is
there to help them and that we're human, too.''
</P>
<P>
   SHAARK gets pupils from diverse backgrounds _ youths who attend
Bishop Amat, Bassett, Diamond Bar, Nogales, Rowland and Los Altos
high schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty cool,'' said Keith Hands, 16, of Diamond Bar. ``I
never thought about (diving before), but I like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hacienda Heights' Joann Stran said her daughter, Gina, could not
have tried scuba diving had it not been for SHAARK. ``We could
never afford this,'' Stran said.
</P>
<P>
   The course is taught by Gordon Bouvin, a 25-year veteran dive
instructor, member of the sheriff's auxiliary rescue dive team and
emergency room technician at Burbank's St. Joseph Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we could get 100 kids in this program,'' Bouvin said.
``We've had so many neat results.''
</P>
<P>
   Bouvin said it's actually easier to teach these youths to dive
than to teach adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't hold back,'' he said. ``They watch you do it and
then they do it. Adults ask, `Why?'''
</P>
<P>
   Asking ``why'' and watching her daughters, Roman said she was
worried about their dives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have one diver for every two or three students,'' said a
reassuring Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, Marissa and Danielle came back safely from Catalina,
having made many new friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get a wide spectrum of kids and we show they can all work
together,'' Worden said.

JET DESIGNED BY CALIFORNIAN WOULD LEAVE CONCORDE IN THE DUST 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID PERLMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANSCISO _ An aerospace engineer from the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory has designed a high-flying plane that
would skip in and out of the upper atmosphere at 10 times the speed
of sound _ the fastest aircraft ever.
</P>
<P>
   The plane would enable a fast-paced Silicon Valley executive to
eat breakfast at home, lunch and dinner with business partners in
Tokyo, and be back home by supper time, said Preston Carter, an
engineer at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft also would make it possible for commercial
satellite launchers to boost five times more payload into orbit
than an Atlas/ Centaur rocket at a fraction of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   And it would enable freight carriers or express mail companies
to carry 200,000 pounds of cargo between San Francisco and London
in a single day _ using one plane making four flights a day.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is fantasy, insists Carter, whose unique design for
an airplane he calls the ``HyperSoar'' is already under discussion
with Air Force brass as a possible future bomber.
</P>
<P>
   HyperSoar, Carter claims, would fly at 6,700 miles an hour _ 10
times the speed of sound. By comparison, the Concorde, the fastest
commercial aircraft, has a top speed of about 1,800 mph. At that
speed, the HyperSoar could travel between any two points on the
globe in two hours or less.
</P>
<P>
   The trick, Carter explained Thursday, is for the plane's flight
to carry it skipping in and out of the Earth's upper atmosphere
like a flat stone skipping over the surface of a pond.
</P>
<P>
   HyperSoar's air-breathing engines would speed the plane upward
from inside the atmosphere, then turn off as the aircraft zoomed
higher and coasted. Then, as the plane swooped down, the engines
would take another bite of the thin high-altitude air.
</P>
<P>
   The plane would reach an altitude of 130,000 feet at the apex of
its flight.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the roller-coaster motion of the plane, Carter said the
HyperSoar would be no ``vomit comet'' and would provide a
surprisingly smooth ride. ``Above the atmosphere a passenger would
be weightless for two minutes or so, but never experience more than
1.5 g _ which is what a kid feels for a second or so after pumping
to the top of a swing.''
</P>
<P>
   The 41-year-old engineer said he began musing about markets for
faster-than-ever intercontinental express mail when he was fresh
out of graduate school. So he contacted Frederick W. Smith,
president of Federal Express Corp. Smith told him that he had
abandoned the idea of buying a fleet of Concordes to speed his
deliveries, but he encouraged Carter to continue his research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the design of HyperSoar is mature enough to test its
aerodynamic qualities,'' Carter said. He is working to analyze his
design with Air Force engineers at Edwards Air Force Base in
California as well as with aeronautic engineers at the University
of California at Los Angeles and the University of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect wind tunnel tests on a model to begin next year,''
he said, ``and we could have a flyable one-third scale prototype
within three years for about $350 million.''
</P>
<P>
   How much would it cost to develop and fly a complete version of
the HyperSoar plane? About $5 billion to $10 billion _ about the
same cost as developing any new major aircraft today, Carter said.

MORE STUDENTS BOOZING TO GET DRUNK, STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARL T. HALL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   America's college campuses appear to be awash in alcohol as an
epidemic of student binge drinking shows no sign of abating,
researchers reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Updating a landmark 1993 survey, researchers at the Harvard
School of Public Health found disheartening evidence that college
students still have much to learn about the hazards of heavy
boozing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had an intensification of drinking behavior,'' said
Henry Wechsler, lead author of both the original study and the
update.
</P>
<P>
   The new survey, conducted during 1997, drew responses from
14,521 students at 116 institutions in 39 states. Colleges were
chosen to give a cross-section of U.S. higher education.
</P>
<P>
   Results add more fuel to growing concern about deadly drinking
bouts on campus and cultural factors that seem to foster heavy
consumption. Study authors called drinking to get drunk ``by far
the single most serious public health problem confronting American
colleges.''
</P>
<P>
   College administrators have been trying to curtail the trend,
but without much success. Alcohol-related arrests have been rising
each year since the original Harvard report was issued. And
drinking has been cited as a prime factor in date rape and other
violent episodes marring campus life.
</P>
<P>
   The new survey contains one glimmer of what might be termed good
news _ a significant increase in the minority of students who said
they hadn't imbibed for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   Campus abstainers rose from 15.6 percent of those surveyed in
1993 to 19.0 percent last year. That increase explained a small
drop in the overall percentage of students who fit the definition
of ``binge drinker'' _ someone who had consumed at least five
drinks in a row for men or four in a row for women within two weeks
of the survey.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers said the increase in abstainers masked the real
trend revealed in such findings as these:
</P>
<P>
   -- The proportion of students who said they ``drank to get
drunk'' jumped from 39 percent in 1993 to 52 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   -- Those who reported having been drunk three or more times
within the prior month increased from 22.9 percent in 1993 to 27.9
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   -- As was the case in 1993, college fraternities and sororities
seem to be soaked to the gills. About 4 out of 5 residents, or 81.1
percent in the new survey, qualified as ``binge drinkers.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on high school consumption patterns, Wechsler said it
appears that fraternities and sororities both attract more heavy
drinkers and also foster binge-drinking among residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The few people who are not binge drinkers when they join
sororities and fraternities soon become binge drinkers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sororities, he added, seem to be especially dangerous, because
more young women join without prior experience with alcohol and
thus are more vulnerable to the harmful effects.
</P>
<P>
   Among all the students who fit the binge-drinker definition,
there was a marked increase since the prior study in the frequency
of drinking, more drunkenness and more alcohol-related problems
such as missing classes, dropping behind in studies, getting hurt,
landing in trouble with the police or requiring medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, heavy drinking often leads to more
risk-taking, and the survey found an increase in those taking truly
dangerous chances.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent study, 35.8 percent of the students said they
had driven a car after drinking since the school year began, up
from 31.6 percent in 1993, while 11.2 percent had engaged in
unprotected sex, up from 9.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Authors speculate that the secondary effects of heavy drinking
may be partly responsible for the increase in those abstaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be a polarization on college campuses,''
Wechsler said, with more students staying off alcohol while those
who keep drinking engage in ever-more destructive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   He was joined during a Boston news conference by a Georgetown
University senior, Daniel Meade, who recalled frequent blackouts
and missed classes before he dried up 16 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Meade called on campuses to make counseling and other
alcohol-related health programs more accessible to students in
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making it as plain and obvious as possible to students is
key,'' he said. ``No ones really is eager to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Some outside influences also may need to change. Wechsler noted
that sports events seem to be virtually synonymous with alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't think of a sporting event without thinking of a
beer,'' he noted, adding that the entire nation watched Mark
McGwire hit his historic 62nd home run from Busch Stadium in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that bars frequented by students often give
price deals for those who buy pitchers and drink in quantity.
</P>
<P>
   Wechsler noted that drinking is really an ancient tradition on
many campuses that will be hard to uproot. Asked to recall his own
college drinking experiences, he declined to give details but said
``there was a lot of drinking in those days,'' though perhaps not
as much among female students as there is now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is necessarily a new phenomenon,'' he said.
``But I do think the intensification of drinking to get drunk has
increased.''

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW YORK _ They've noticed. Oh, yes, they have.
</P>
<P>
   They are the Yankees, who would be the story of this year in
baseball if not for the burly brute in St. Louis and his alter ego
in Chicago. But while the nation's fans have mostly turned their
lonely eyes to the McGwire-Sosa pow-wow!, those Bombers who reside
in the Bronx have been paying closer attention than you might
realize to the National League's secondary subplot.
</P>
<P>
   The one gripping Houston, starring the Big Unit. Because,
although the Yankees are vying to become the winningest team in
history, they realize they might not be even the best team in the
game. No, the Astros are. That doesn't mean they will be come
October, but in the present tense, the Astros are making everyone
else tense, Joe Torre's bullies included.
</P>
<P>
   Since Aug. 1, when Johnson landed on our doorstep, the Astros
are 29-9. The Yankees, despite being on track to win a record-tying
116 times in 1998, despite having clinched the AL East title
earlier than anybody since divisional play began three decades ago,
are a mere 28-14.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're legitimate,'' says Mel Stottlemyre, who was once the
Astros' pitching coach, the same job he holds for Torre. ``Ever
since they got Randy (Johnson), we've been paying attention to
them. I know I have. And personally, I'm happy for Houston. I've
got a lot of friends down there. So wish 'em good luck for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mel stopped short of adding a ``See you later.'' You suspect the
Yankees would rather see anybody come forth from the NL _ the
Braves included. With Johnson, the Astros have evolved into a
virtual mirror image of New York's finest, an exceptionally
talented, extraordinarily quiet, businesslike bunch that has found
a way to dig deep enough to create a sum that exceeds the
formidable parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gain confidence from each other,'' says the feisty second
baseman, Chuck Knoblauch, who grew up in Houston rooting for the
Astros. ``Everyone makes the player next to him better. It looks
like that's what's happening in Houston, too, since he (Johnson)
got there. It's crazy what they're doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the disappointments of '80 and '86, the city deserves a
shot at the World Series. That would be great for the two of us to
make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, except for the ticket thing,'' he said. ``I don't know
where I'd get enough to take care of everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are managed by a popular old catcher, the Astros by
a popular old pitcher. Both clubhouses brim with camaraderie and
cordiality, with hail-fellows-well-met everywhere you turn. Here,
in the House That Ruth Built and Steinbrenner hopes to tear down,
the infamous Bronx Zoo is gone.
</P>
<P>
   You can pet the animals and not lose a finger. Good guys can
finish first.
</P>
<P>
   But recently the Yankees, according to Torre, have ``lost a
little of their edge,'' simultaneous with the Astros having found
theirs. Pitching is suddenly a major sore spot with Andy Pettitte
out of whack _ Toronto, its 8-5 loss notwithstanding, rocked him
early Thursday night, as the White Sox had in his previous start _
and the U.N. duo, Hideki Irabu and ``El Duque,'' Orlando Hernandez,
slumping.
</P>
<P>
   Torre plans to let them all attempt to pitch their way out of
their funks, but he calls what he has seen of late disappointing.
Collectively, they are largely why the Yankees are only 6-5 in
their past 11 starts, although victories in Boston on Tuesday and
Wednesday, which clinched the division title, and Thursday's win
left them 62 games over .500 _ the most in 59 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Also, only one team ever, the '75 Big Red Machine in Cincinnati,
put a lock on a championship faster.
</P>
<P>
   After a 1-4 start, on through the end of July, New York went a
ridiculous 74-23, leaving itself positioned to blow by the 116
victories run up by the 1906 Cubs. But now, if the record falls, it
probably will be by the narrowest of margins, and Torre has decided
to set his sights on a more ``modest'' goal _ 111. Which would tie
the 1954 Indians' AL standard and surpass the 110 won by the 1927
Yankees, arguably the greatest team ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win more games than any other Yankee team, that's the big
one for me personally,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   But he's confronting a dilemma Dierker must soon face: Go for
the maximum number of W's or preserve his key players for the
postseason. Torre's intention is to field the Yankees' ``A team''
against opponents competing for playoff spots while substituting
more freely against the dregs.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of which, if there's an asterisk attached to what they
have accomplished to date, it's that they are only 21-16 against
their nominal AL peer group _ on-a-tear Toronto included _ vs.
82-25 against the rest.
</P>
<P>
   This is why the Astros needn't fear them, never mind anybody
else. With the 6-10 Johnson, they stand tall. Tall enough for even
the Yankees to sneak a peek.

`ROUNDERS' HOLDS A WINNING HAND 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  NOTE: David Levien and Gretchen Mol are cq 
 
By JEFF MILLAR 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Rounders,'' an exceptionally engrossing film, the title
refers to people who make their living gambling at cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't sit at the table and spot the sucker within 30
minutes,'' says Mike (Matt Damon), the film's protagonist and
voice-over narrator, ``then you are the sucker.''
</P>
<P>
   A synopsis won't do justice to this movie. The plot is no more
than the wire frame for David Levien's and Brian Koppelman's
screenplay. That frame has been well-used _ the major plot points
will come as no surprise to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The value of ``Rounders'' lies in unexpectedly intense empathy
with the characters _ even the character you tell yourself you're
not supposed to like _ and with intriguing detail.
</P>
<P>
   There are several skeins of interest.
</P>
<P>
   One is the milieu _ illegal gambling in the New York City area.
``Dens'' would be the exact word to call these smelly venues. What
Mike does very well _ play no-limit Texas hold-'em poker (``the
Cadillac of card games'') _ is entirely legal only a few hours away
in Atlantic City. But the suckers are riper for the picking in the
local circuit of standing illegal games that rounders know like
airline departure times.
</P>
<P>
   Mike plays straight poker. He's not a mechanic (a cheat). He's
proud of his hard-won, hard-practiced skill. He aspires to the
World Series of Poker yearly shootout in Las Vegas, televised on
ESPN, the way Double-A ballplayers fantasize themselves in the
bigs.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mike is expert in the statistically based stuff _ when
to hold 'em and when to fold 'em _ his particular talent is reading
``tells'' _ the clues by which opponents reveal cards and strategy
no matter how hard they try to keep poker faces. He's basically a
decent kid, but emotionally atomizing an opponent is simply sound
rounder business. The memory will be a huge advantage to Mike the
next time he and the demoralized opponent shuffle and deal and the
pot is stacked high.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, can't he read the tells of Worm (Edward Norton), who,
soon after the film begins, Mike picks up as Worm is released from
prison? Worm is Mike's best friend since boyhood, an equity swelled
by Worm's being in prison when Mike should be in there with him.
Worm did not give up Mike, a partner in a scam, when doing so would
have reduced his sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Worm quickly becomes a Claymore mine around Mike's neck. Worm
owes gambling debts to some nasty people. Mike feels obliged to
help Worm pay it back, and Worm wants to make the money by
cheating. That's the way he and Mike were partners before Worm got
sent up.
</P>
<P>
   Mike has moved on. He's in law school. He gambles honestly,
winning by skill, to pay law-school tuition and to pay his share of
the rent with fellow-student/girlfriend Jo (Gretchen Mol), dodging
his promises to her to quit.
</P>
<P>
   When Mike allows himself to go in harm's way on Worm's behalf,
it is under the impulse of loyalty and something else. When Mike is
gambling at cards, especially when the stakes are higher than the
pot on the table, Mike feels within himself. When he is a law
student, he does not. Yet the film does not get existential; it
aspires wisely and with restraint simply to tell an interesting
story well.
</P>
<P>
   John Dahl's direction is simultaneously silky and gritty. It's
an autonomous, free-standing movie, with none of the film-noir
textbook feel of most of his previous films (``The Last Seduction''
and ``Red Rock West'').
</P>
<P>
   Damon is a very good actor, but what makes him work in this film
is pure movie star stuff. Damon has the monstrous advantage of
constellations of empathy lined up behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Mike's dilemma is one of the ubiquitous, unavoidable passages of
the early 20s. If you're old enough to have passed ahead of him
through the same latitudes, the film's sense of
been-there-done-that is mellowed and piquant.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Norton does what is dangerous for an actor, which is to
play the character's contradictions and let the audiences sort out
for themselves how they feel about it.
</P>
<P>
   It is not very ingratiating, but it is very honest. The
screenwriters and Norton have worked hard and made Worm a character
whose love of disrepute is attractive, dangerous and, at end,
unutterably sad.
</P>
<P>
   We tell Mike early and often: You've reached the logical and
ethical limit of loyalty; cut and run now from this liability, even
if he loves you and you love him.
</P>
<P>
   But Mike won't, because he's decent enough to extend, again and
again, the window of opportunity for Worm to save himself.

THE magic number is four. I think.
</P>
<P>
   It could be 63, 64 or 65, as in home runs. It could be 430, as
in section 430, which is one of the likely places Astrodome fans
figure to scuffle for leather like it's the rodeo calf scramble all
over again.
</P>
<P>
   It could be 98, as in the miles per hour with which Randy
Johnson could challenge the game's greatest home-run hitter.
</P>
<P>
   It all depends on what Astros fans truly want to get out of this
weekend's date with the Mark McGwire Cardinals, a series that won't
offer the circus atmosphere that surrounded McGwire's quest for No.
62 but will have enough intrigue to fill at least three rings.
</P>
<P>
   Begin with McGwire, America's most eligible slugger, and the
question of how many homers he can add to his unbelievable total.
Could his final one of this unforgettable season land in your hands
this weekend? Could he hit three, four, five? Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   But how many homers are too many when you are an Astros fan and
the home-field edge for the playoffs is on the line?
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude of McGwire's recent record-breaking accomplishment
should begin to sink in for him this weekend. This is good news for
fans hoping to catch a bit of history.
</P>
<P>
   But it is potentially tormenting news for Astros pitchers, even
those you might call Magic Johnson when you are not referring to
him as Randy or the Big Unit.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire should begin relaxing again under the Dome's big top. He
should get back to the business of putting on magical shows and
sending baseballs deep into the seats.
</P>
<P>
   The circus has left McGwire's locker stall. The media crush has
been reduced to a nudge, or at worst a determined shove. He has had
a few days to begin comprehending the incomprehensible, sort
through the Jay Leno and David Letterman invites and, like Stella,
get his groove back.
</P>
<P>
   He has had time to break in a new uniform and cleats, after
Cooperstown stripped him of everything but his goatee Tuesday
night. He has sipped champagne, sure, but McGwire now is back to
protein shakes and weightlifting sessions.
</P>
<P>
   This could be bad news, or good, depending on if you are McGwire
or the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   When McGwire hit No. 62 on Tuesday, he hardly remembered
trotting around the bases. He was whisked here and there, tugged on
one sleeve and then the other, carted around on the back of a '62
Corvette like the grand marshal of the world. He remembered some of
it but not all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched the highlights,'' he said, ``just so I knew what I
was doing out there.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire didn't sleep but a few winks the night of the record.
There was the big celebration, a call from the president, a few
toasts from teammates on the charter to Cincinnati and cameras
waiting when the Cards checked into their hotel at 4:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Even when McGwire finally said hello to the inside of his
eyelids in the wee hours, his senses were not ready to say good
night. He tossed and turned and futilely tried to come down from
the heavenly high. He didn't. Couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire nobly tried to play in front of the Cincinnati fans
Wednesday night, but the only four-baggers were under his eyes. He
was whipped. But he should be feeling much better now.
</P>
<P>
   He should be ready to fill the air with more vanishing
baseballs. The show must go on, and it will. Get ready, section
430.
</P>
<P>
   But here is where this weekend's magic act gets most intriguing.
Three or four home runs from McGwire are what Astros fans want to
see, but don't really.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the home-run king could slam a hanging curveball and the
home team still could hang another division flag in the same game.
But McGwire could have one of those remarkable multihomer efforts
that dominate a series and sour the Astros' postseason hopes.
</P>
<P>
   The better McGwire feels, the more difficult it will be for the
Astros to erase their magic number and stay on pace to have the
league's best record and home-field edge.
</P>
<P>
   This should be a series when McGwire feels good again. He should
be ready to flex, swing and crush the ball.
</P>
<P>
   But all that means is the pressure has been lifted from McGwire
and rests on the Astros' collective shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   The burly redheaded slugger no doubt will have mountains of
praise and congratulations heaped upon him when the series begins
today. But that's where the Astros want it to stop.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has had his magical night; the Astros are working on
getting to theirs. &QL;

CLINTON APOLOGIZES TO CABINET, KEY DEMOCRATS 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Continuing his campaign of contrition, President
Clinton on Thursday gathered his Cabinet and Senate Democratic
leaders at the White House to again apologize for misleading them
about his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's public and private apologies _ and his attempt to
nudge the debate beyond his private conduct to his public duty _
seem to be the only strategy the administration has at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is trying to staunch the erosion of support in
Congress while awaiting the public release of the independent
counsel report that accuses the president of impeachable crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, speaking at a midday awards ceremony, called the
apology sessions ``part of this process I'm going through of
talking to people with whom I work and with whom I must work in
your behalf to ask for their understanding, their forgiveness, and
their commitment not to let the events of the moment in Washington
deter us from doing the people's work here and building the future
of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and the president attended two
Democratic Party fund-raising events Thursday night. The first lady
introduced the president with a mound of praise for his
``unrelenting determination to do what is best for America and for
the children who will inherit our country.'' She spoke of her pride
in his leadership and commitment to the nation, and they hugged as
she turned over the podium to him at the first event.
</P>
<P>
   There has been much speculation over what the first lady would
say publicly, if anything, in Clinton's defense. She has provided
critical support to Clinton in past crises.
</P>
<P>
   For the second day, the president expressed sorrow for the
relationship with the young aide, and asked forgiveness as Congress
pondered what to do with the report submitted Wednesday by
independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The president convened his Cabinet in the private residential
area of the White House. It was the first Cabinet meeting since
Jan. 23, when Clinton summoned senior officials to the White House
to deny a sexual relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   His denials prompted Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala and Commerce
Secretary William Daley to staunchly defend him after the January
meeting. They did not talk to reporters on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from the meeting, however, indicated that an exchange
between Shalala and Clinton turned testy. The Washington Post,
quoting a participant, said that after Shalala asked Clinton
whether he really believed his policies were more important than
moral leadership, Clinton rebuked her.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman later said, ``Nobody is happy
with having to go through a kind of candid encounter session, so to
speak, where members of the Cabinet were extremely candid in terms
of our observations and feelings.'' He said the president was open
about expressing his ``sorrow and regret.''
</P>
<P>
   James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management
Administration and a Clinton ally from Arkansas, said, ``A lot of
healing was done tonight. I think it helped all of us, and I think
it helped the president because it was very emotional, very
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Clinton, joined by Vice President Al Gore, gathered the
Senate Democratic leadership into the White House residence.
Clinton apologized and asked for forgiveness, just as he did to
House Democratic leaders the previous day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shared his feelings and apologized to us personally,'' said
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. ``We have expressed the
hope that the president will continue to demonstrate his contrition
to his family, to his friends and to the American people, and he's
indicated a desire to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said the senators urged the president to cooperate with
the process under way in Congress. When asked, the president
assured them there were no surprises in the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also expressed the need to bring this to a closure, to
allow this country to heal, to allow us to continue to work on the
nation's business,'' Daschle said. He added that there was no
discussion of possible resignation or impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Texas, a deputy whip who attended the
previous White House session, said many Democratic leaders believe
mass apologies are necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the American people have a tremendous capacity to
forgive someone for mistakes if they are convinced the person is
truly sorry. The first step is for him to let the American people
know how deeply he feels about his mistake and the pain he's caused
his family and the country,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials were remaining mum about the
administration's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about it publicly because the events will
unfold as they unfold. So I can't predict for you what the news
will be this time next week, so I'm not going to tell you that we
have an ironclad strategy,'' said Mike McCurry, White House
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Lewis, the president's communications director, said the
apologies are being crafted by Clinton, not by his staff. ``The
statements he makes that connect best with the American people come
from the heart,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Some public opinion polls show slippage among those who approve
of the job Clinton is doing as president. Clinton recently had an
approval rating of 57 percent in an ABC News survey and 59 percent
in a CBS News poll, a respective drop of seven and six percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   But a poll by the Pew Research Center for the People &AMP; the Press
indicated that Clinton's approval rating remained steady at 61
percent. It noted that his support has remained 60 percent or
higher since the Lewinsky scandal broke in January.

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
The Astros didn't leave much more than the carcass from their
season-long feast at the expense of the Milwaukee Brewers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The piddling remains were packaged with Shane Reynolds wrap on a
day when the veteran righthander carved up the Brewers with an
assortment of pitches that sliced and diced their way through the
strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds tied a career high with 12 strikeouts and just missed a
shutout, pitching 8 innings in the Astros' 7-1 victory Thursday at
the Astrodome. His shutout bid ended when he walked Geoff Jenkins
with the bases loaded in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Doug Henry notched the final two outs to send the
Astros to their sixth consecutive victory and their 18th in 22
games. Thursday's victory completed the Astros' 14th series sweep
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, whose 94-53 record is the best in the National
League, reduced their magic number to four and could clinch the NL
Central Division as early as Saturday. The division race would have
been over long ago if Milwaukee had appeared on the schedule more
often.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros won the season series from the Brewers 9-2 and took
all six games at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how the Astros ever lose a game,'' Brewers
manager Phil Garner said. ``I'm serious about that. They don't make
any mistakes. Their pitching has been superb.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds (18-8) took a no-hitter to the fifth inning and retired
the first 12 batters he faced. Although he seldom faced danger,
Reynolds was gritty when he needed to be, twice stranding runners
at third.
</P>
<P>
   The strong outing came on the heels of Reynolds' shortest of the
season. He allowed five runs on nine hits in three innings in his
previous start, a 6-5 Astros victory at Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to have your best stuff every time out,''
Reynolds said. ``But I had really good stuff this time. I felt good
from the beginning of the game, and it gives you a lot of
confidence when you get this type of run support.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros missed a chance to provide some support in the first
inning when Richard Hidalgo was stranded after a one-out double.
But the NL's highest-scoring team compensated by blistering Scott
Karl for four runs in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys are red-hot,'' Karl (9-9) said of the Astros, who
have outscored their opponents 145-69 over the last 22 games.
``It's like running into a buzz saw.''
</P>
<P>
   Derek Bell drove home a pair of runs with a double to right, and
Tony Eusebio's single up the middle produced two more. Bell's hit
pushed his RBI count to 101 as he joined Jeff Bagwell and Moises
Alou as the first 100-RBI trio in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to see those 100s up there,'' Bell said. ``The
runners were moving, and I knew there was going to be a hole
between first and second, so I just shot it through the hole.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros went cold for the next four innings, collecting just
two hits and advancing only one runner into scoring position. A
spell of wildness by reliever David Weathers helped the Astros pad
their lead with three runs in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those were driven in by Reynolds, who has 12 hits this
season and leads Astros pitchers with nine RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you just get lucky every now and then,'' Reynolds
said. ``I actually thought the pitch was going to hit me. All of us
pitchers work fairly hard on our hitting, because sometimes it's
good to be able to help yourself out.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, who threw 129 pitches, was two outs from his fourth
complete game before needing Henry's help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shane still had good stuff at the end,'' manager Larry Dierker
said. ``He just lost control. This is the longest I've ever seen
him maintain velocity. He was still throwing hard in the ninth
inning. He pitched an exceptional game. He had command of all of
his pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Astros have command of their destiny. The St. Louis
Cardinals come to town tonight for the start of a three-game
series, and while most of the focus will be on Mark McGwire, the
Astros will be concentrating on whittling down their magic number.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me,'' Henry said. ``We know it's (the magic number)
there. That's not our ultimate goal, but we still know it's
there.''

REPUBLICANS REFUSE TO LET PRESIDENT SEE REPORT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans rejected requests Thursday to give
President Clinton a preview of the evidence that threatened to
topple him, as the House moved to release independent counsel
Kenneth Starr's report on the case for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the 445-page report locked in a House office building
until it is publicly released, likely Friday, news organizations
were being leaked politically volatile details that allege Clinton
lied to the grand jury, obstructed justice, tampered with witnesses
and abused his power as president.
</P>
<P>
   With his presidency in jeopardy, Clinton tried to shore up
support with more apologies, this time to Senate Democrats and his
Cabinet, for his affair with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky and for seven months of lying about it.
</P>
<P>
   Facing the prospect of only the third impeachment proceeding
against a president in the 222 years of the republic, Republicans
and Democrats spent much of Thursday arguing over how Starr's
report would be handled.
</P>
<P>
   Republican House leaders rejected a push by Democrats and White
House lawyers to provide the president an advance copy of the
evidence compiled by Starr and time to prepare a response before
the report is made public.
</P>
<P>
   After being turned down by leaders of the House Judiciary
Committee, Clinton's lawyer David Kendall emphasized that Starr's
report only provides one side. Kendall called the document, which
he says he has not seen, a collection of prosecutor's
``contentions, claims and allegations, and we look forward to the
chance to rebut them.''
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Irving said not even House
members are reading the report until it is released publicly, so
they are not inclined to grant a White House request for
preferential treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report is made to the Congress of the United States, and
it is the responsibility of the Congress, on as even-handed a basis
as possible, to make it available to all interested parties ... at
the same time,'' Armey said.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans were prepared to push through a resolution
Friday to put the 445-page report, but not the supporting material,
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every American will have access,'' said Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   The supporting documents, described as 2,600 pages of
transcripts, telephone logs, videotapes and audiotapes, will be
reviewed behind closed doors during the next 2-1/2 weeks by members
of the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The House Rules Committee late Thursday approved the resolution,
but only after voting 8-4 along party lines against an amendment
that would have delayed releasing Starr's report until Clinton has
time to prepare a rebuttal. The resolution was scheduled for debate
by the full House early Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The report that Starr delivered to the House on Wednesday has
three parts _ an introduction, a narrative describing events
surrounding Clinton's 18-month affair with Lewinsky, and a 140-page
section that outlines possible grounds for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting lawyers who insisted on anonymity, several news
organizations reported overnight that the report asserts that
Clinton not only lied when questioned under oath in the Paula
Jones' lawsuit, but he lied when questioned before the grand jury
four weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The report cites, as evidence, that Clinton tried to thwart
Jones' lawsuit, which accused him of sexual harassment, during
meetings with Lewinsky in July 1997 and with his personal
secretary, Betty Curry, in December and January.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post reported that the document recounts, in
lurid detail, a dozen White House sexual encounters Clinton had
with the former White House intern, who was 21 years old when their
affair began.
</P>
<P>
   In the document, prosecutors reportedly assert a pattern of
lying by Clinton and an effort to bolster his lies by using
government employees and resources to disrupt Starr's criminal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence reportedly ranges from a false statement, which
Clinton approved for his press secretary to distribute when the
Lewinsky scandal was first reported on Jan. 21, to the legal
battles waged by the White House counsel and other government
lawyers to block Starr's access to key presidential advisers and
Secret Service agents.
</P>
<P>
   Not included in the document is any evidence of impeachable
offenses from Starr's four-year investigation of Clinton's Arkansas
business dealings, the alleged misuse of FBI files or the White
House travel office firings.
</P>
<P>
   As the House wrestled with how to proceed, Starr's grand jury
met with prosecutors to go over additional evidence. The panel
still could bring criminal charges against Clinton associates who
might have been involved in the alleged cover-up of the Lewinsky
affair.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the only strategy that Clinton seems to have embraced to
deal with the scandal is to issue frequent, emotional apologies. On
Thursday, he asked forgiveness from Senate Democrats and members of
his Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton began the day with Senate Democratic leaders, who
provided blunt assessments of how his behavior has crippled him
politically. One source told The Associated Press that Sen. Harry
Reid, D-Nev., told Clinton that Clinton ``didn't just let us down,
you betrayed us.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid went on to tell the president that his ``support on the
Hill is very thin,'' an assertion endorsed by Sen. Bob Kerrey,
D-Nebraska. ``The possibility of impeachment is there,'' Kerrey was
quoted as telling Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say we all accepted his apology,'' said Minority
Leader Thomas Daschle after the closed-door session with the
president.

   TORONTO _ Every September, those in the movie world fly over the
Great Lakes, flocking to this attractive Ontario city for the
Toronto International Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Filmmakers, fans, the press and industry executives come to see
what's in store for the rest of the year and whom to watch in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   In size alone, it's a big festival. You can tell that as soon as
you pick up the festival program, all 408 pages.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, the official opening day of the 10-day festival,
there were 311 movies entered.
</P>
<P>
   The festival's opening film, ``The Red Violin,'' and the picture
set to close the festival on Sept. 19, DreamWorks' animated
``Antz,'' only hint at the broad range in this festival.
</P>
<P>
   While ``The Red Violin'' features Samuel L. Jackson and Greta
Scacci in its large cast, it is hardly a Hollywood movie. It was
made by Canadian filmmakers Francois Girard and Don McKeller, the
team that did the 1993 movie ``Thirty-two Short Films About Glenn
Gould.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red Violin'' is the story of a perfect musical instrument
as it travels across five continents and three centuries in the
hands of several owners, affecting the fate of each person who
falls under its spell. Viewers are taken along to each period and
place, and follow the fate of each owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antz,'' sure to be carefully market-researched and slickly
packaged, is DreamWorks' first animation release, the story of a
brave little ant who wants an identity separate from his mound. Its
long list of star voices includes Woody Allen, Sharon Stone and
Gene Hackman.
</P>
<P>
   The movies are divided into 12 categories, including Galas (the
big events), Masters (accomplished world directors), Contemporary
World Cinema, Discovery (from unknowns who show promise) and Real
to Reel (documentaries).
</P>
<P>
   Of those 311 films, ``244 of the films are features, and the
rest are shorts,'' festival communications director Nuria Bronfman
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the festival's activities are located in the
Bloor-Yorkville area of downtown Toronto, a modern metropolitan
area with more than a smattering of old homes and historical
buildings nestled among the skyscrapers. Three of the five festival
theaters are within a three-block area near arty Yonge Street,
where black-leather-clad punkers with brightly colored hair and
downtown executives in suits mix in nearly equal numbers.
</P>
<P>
   This truly is an international festival, with 53 countries
represented. There are about 650 members of the news media on hand
_ that number would grow if the festival could handle them.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from size, Toronto is an important festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the pre-eminent film festival in North America,'' said
Houston Museum of Fine Arts film curator Marian Luntz.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the studios, large and small, are represented. Warner
Bros., Paramount, Miramax, New Line, Lion's Gate, Polygram, Sony
Classics, Artisan, Trimark, October, Gramercy and DreamWorks have
films showing here.
</P>
<P>
   With a few exceptions, such as ``Antz,'' they are not presenting
potential blockbusters, but are showing small or artistic movies
that depend on good reviews and advance interviews _ rather than
$50 million TV-advertising campaigns _ to find an audience.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of actors and filmmakers will be here to attend their
film premieres and meet the media: Janet Leigh, Meryl Streep, John
Boorman, Holly Hunter, Tom Cruise (as producer), Ben Stiller,
Elizabeth Hurley, John Waters, Helena Bonham Carter, Janeane
Garofalo, Roberto Benigni, Drew Barrymore, Stanley Tucci, James
Woods, Wes Anderson, Vince Vaughn and Isabelle Huppert, to name a
few.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many movies due out soon that are being previewed at
the festival are: ``Pecker,'' John Water's sneer at mainstream
life; ``Dancing at Lughnasa,'' from the Tony-winning play, with
Meryl Streep as one of five Irish sisters; ``A Simple Plan,'' based
on the best-selling thriller; ``Living Out Loud,'' a romantic
comedy with Holly Hunter and Danny DeVito, directed by the script
writer of ``The Horse Whisperer,'' Richard LaGravenese;
``Pleasantville,'' in which modern kids enter '50s TV land and
bring color to the lives of an Ozzie and Harriet-style family (with
Joan Allen and Jeff Daniels), directed by the screenwriter of
``Dave'' and ``Big,'' Gary Ross.
</P>
<P>
   Also: ``The Siege,'' an intimate film from Bernardo Bertolucci,
with David Thewlis; ``The General,'' John Boorman's
(``Deliverace'') story of an Irish gangster, with Jon Voight;
``Tango,'' a new dance film from Carlos Saura; ``A Soldier's
Daughter Never Cries,'' the Merchant-Ivory production based on the
family of novelist James Jones, played here with a different name
by Kris Kristofferson; ``Life is Beautiful,'' the controversial
``comedy'' fable set in a Nazi death camp, starring and directed by
Roberto Benigni.

POIGNANT `SLUMS' GIVES HUMOR TO GROWING UP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JEFF MILLAR 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Slums of Beverly Hills'' is a coming-of-age movie, the
best of its genre I've seen in years.
</P>
<P>
   It's very, very funny _ heavily sarcastic, often ribald.
Although semiautobiograpical, as most coming-of-age pieces are, the
film never feels generic, as most coming-of-age pieces do. This one
is idiosyncratic and intensely personal. It's warm and deeply
poignant.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Tamara Jenkins' protagonist is 15-year-old
Vivian Abramowitz (Natasha Lyonne). Her mother is absent, and she
is on a virtual desert island with a father, old enough to be her
grandfather, and two brothers who can't or won't respect her, let
alone cherish her.
</P>
<P>
   Puberty has dumped Viv from girlhood into womanhood as if from a
wheelbarrow, and she's getting no help. As the film begins, in
1976, her 65-year-old father (Alan Arkin) has pushed Viv into the
hands of a lingerie saleswoman to deal with Viv's breasts, which
grew big and fast _ overnight, to the perception of her sniggering
brothers and father, who seems to believe his daughter's breasts
grow large in a perverse memorial to his ex-wife.
</P>
<P>
   The humor associated with Viv's new breasts are not breast jokes
but road directions pointing to the girl's intense loneliness,
which is how Jenkins extracts the extraordinary empathy we feel for
Viv.
</P>
<P>
   Whether her breasts truly got that big that fast should not be
subjected to endocrine fact-checking. The point is that to Viv, it
felt as though they got that big that fast. It was life-changing,
the opposite of amputation. And she has no meaningful female in her
life to help her deal with the particulars of being female.
</P>
<P>
   So Viv lives in a state of perpetual, combative embarrassment
exacerbated by the Abramowitzes' socio-economic status. In one of
the occasional voice-overs, Viv calls her family ``the Jewish
Joads.'' Mickey Abramowitz (Arkin) is a luckless car salesman, but
he's determined that his children will be educated in the Beverly
Hills school district. So he rents ghastly furnished apartments
that they must often flee before the second month's rent is due.
She must stuff her clothes into a cardboard box, wrap her hair
dryer around her neck and stumble into the car at 3 a.m. She and
her brothers can do it in their sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Into Viv's life drops cousin Rita (Marisa Tomei), daughter of
her dad's older brother; she's 15 years older than Viv. Rita is an
escapee from a drug rehab center. Her father pays Mickey to take in
Rita. This enables Mickey to move everybody into a halfway decent
place, with an elevator (``Are we bourgeois now?'' asks Viv.).
</P>
<P>
   Rita is so much what Viv wants and needs _ a sister _ that you
want to start applauding the first time the two find something to
giggle about. Sure, Rita is a train wreck, but Viv's a smart kid,
already well on the way to being the Abramowitz family's hero
child; she'll know how to let Rita influence her and how not.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Redford takes executive producer credit for this project,
which began its life at the Sundance Institute. This is Jenkins'
first film. She had help from cinematographer Tom Richmond and from
Rolfe Kent's quirky and effective score.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins wrote first-class dialogue for her first-class cast.
Equally admirable as Tomei and Arkin are David Krumholtz, as Viv's
pothead older brother, and Kevin Corrigan, as the pot dealer and
Charles Manson maven across the street, whom Viv picks, for lack of
alternatives, as a subject of sexual experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins is a better writer of dialogue than she is manager of
narrative. A couple of plot points feel false; one of them,
unhappily, comes in the film's next-to-last look. But these are
small caveats.
</P>
<P>
   Lyonne was the voice-over narrator for the Woody Allen movie,
``Everyone Says I Love You.'' She is smashingly good as Viv. It's
an intelligent performance, and it never looks thought-out. She's a
natural.

`PRINCE OF EGYPT': AN EPIC THAT DEFIES THE DISNEY METHOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 13)  
 (bl)  
 John Canemaker is head of animation studies at New York
University's Tisch School of the Arts. There will be a
retrospective of his animated films at the Museum of Modern Art on
Nov. 6.  
 By JOHN CANEMAKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1937, as Walt Disney put the finishing touches on his first
animated feature, ``Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,'' certain
movie-industry figures, bankers and distributors mocked the film
(sight unseen) as ``Disney's Folly.'' Audiences would never sit for
over an hour watching silly cartoon characters chasing one another,
said the Disney doubters.
</P>
<P>
   As we know, Disney created an enduring animated screen
masterpiece by incorporating live-action techniques into the areas
of staging, editing, narrative and characterization. Over the next
60 years, the innovations of ``Snow White'' solidified into a
formula. To appeal to all age groups, goes the perceived wisdom, an
animated feature must include a musical comedy format with at least
one show-stopping song, funny and cute sidekicks to the hero or
heroine, an even balance of laughter and tears, a fairy-tale
setting and a romantic narrative thrust.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Jeffrey Katzenberg is putting finishing touches on
``The Prince of Egypt,'' the first animated feature from
Dreamworks, the studio he founded with Steven Spielberg and David
Geffen. The subject is unusual for animation: nothing less than the
epic biblical story of Moses, adapted from the first half of
Exodus.
</P>
<P>
   The film, in fact, defiantly goes in the opposite direction from
the now-ingrained Disney pattern in nearly every way. In ``The
Prince of Egypt,'' there is no romantic fairy-tale narrative
engine, and, taking a cue from Spielberg, action-adventure is
emphasized over humor. There are no comic sidekicks _ no talking
mice or crickets, let alone camels or mules. There are songs, by
Stephen Schwartz, but no musical comedy structure (no heroine's ``I
wish/I want'' numbers and no show-stoppers). And the hero kills
another human being, albeit inadvertently, not a witch.
</P>
<P>
   Unusual, too, is the film's release plan: it will open worldwide
(except in Japan and the Middle East) on Dec. 18, dubbed into 25
languages. Also, ``Prince'' will not be merchandised in a parade of
licensed products, a traditionally lucrative source of extra
revenue for most animated films. There is no Burger King or
McDonald's tie-in, no line of toys or dolls.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, some Hollywood pundits are wondering if this film is
``Katzenberg's Folly.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Katzenberg admits that he and Dreamworks are in
uncharted territory. ``I love those Disney movies; it's just not
what we're making,'' he said recently in an interview. ``To go out
and to really change, not in a small way but in total perception,
is a challenge. It's a difficult thing to do and, yes, it's
risky.''
</P>
<P>
   In Katzenberg's decadelong tenure at the Disney studio, which
started in 1984, he used their animation formula to produce
phenomenal box-office successes: ``The Little Mermaid'' (1989),
``Beauty and the Beast'' (1991) and ``The Lion King'' (1994), among
others. ``I think everyone, particularly in animation, is curious
to see, OK, now that Jeffrey is away from Disney, what's he going
to do,'' said an entertainment-industry figure who insisted on
anonymity. ``You have to be a fool not to realize there's an awful
lot riding on this film. Not only its individual cost, but this is
really going to make the reputation of Dreamworks Feature Animation
if it's good and does well.'' Some wags have tagged the new film
``The Zion King.''
</P>
<P>
   So what has Katzenberg brought forth from the mountain? Clearly,
film critics and the public will know only when the movie is
released in December. But after viewing about 50 minutes of
disjointed reels of the work-in-progress _ a mix of final color
sequences and black-and-white ``pencil tests'' _ I have some early
impressions.
</P>
<P>
   The art direction and staging of ``The Prince of Egypt'' appears
to emulate the work of Spielberg, David Lean and Akira Kurosawa
more than that of Walt Disney. If the film evokes any Disney
masterwork it is probably ``Pinocchio'' (1940), with its dark
emotional tone and the larger-than-life sweep of its imagery.
</P>
<P>
   Visually, ``Prince'' is stunning, with lush painterly
backgrounds that often contrast small figures against the grandeur
of huge Egyptian temples and vast deserts. Antiquity has obviously
been researched to a fare-thee-well and lovingly adapted. The
integration of drawings with computer-generated imagery is seamless
and peppered through nearly every scene. A Dreamworks proprietary
computer system called Exposure Tool allows the camera to ``move''
2-D characters and 3-D objects with great flexibility and
convincing, dizzying depth.
</P>
<P>
   The film's three directors _ Brenda Chapman, Steve Hickner and
Simon Wells _ smoothly move major chunks of the plot along through
a judicious compression of events and time. The opening, for
example, is a model of economic visual storytelling, with editing,
animation, pacing and even color changes synchronized to a song
called ``Deliver Us.'' The music and imagery manages in a few
minutes to encompass the backbreaking slavery of the
temple-builders, the slaughter of the innocents, Moses' journey
down the Nile in a basket and his discovery by an Egyptian royal.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive, too, is the Passover sequence, a chilling
Spielbergian close encounter with death that begins with a crack in
the sky from which a ghostly vapor descends upon Egypt. The
abstract steam (a special effect of drawn and computer-generated
imagery) implies sentience in the manner in which it avoids
dwellings protected by lamb's blood while boldly, pitilessly
entering other less fortunate houses. There, a first-born child may
run inside full of life and, after a literally breathtaking sound,
reappear as only a small limp hand falling out a doorway, or be
represented by a snuffed candle on a windowsill.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear already, however, that the emotional weight of the
film is primarily carried by the life-giving animation of the human
characters, a notoriously difficult form to animate well. Here, the
team of traditional animators _ many of them Disney-trained _ have
fashioned convincing and dignified performances, reportedly done
without the use of ``rotoscoping,'' a technique of tracing
live-action photos. Intense emotions are believably conveyed not
only through strong body language but through incredibly subtle eye
movements.
</P>
<P>
   The design of the ``Prince'' characters holds an elegant,
stylized Egyptian hieroglyphic quality, and their facial
proportions are a departure from Disney's large-eyed style.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   I could not judge from the disconnected sequences of ``Prince''
whether its narrative flows throughout, or how it builds, or
whether there are long periods of Bible-speak between
special-effects sequences. I did not see the climactic parting of
the Red Sea, said to be a tour-de-force melding of traditional and
computer animation.
</P>
<P>
   My early general impression of ``The Prince of Egypt'' is that
this is a serious work, a film of integrity, and an attempt to make
a real movie in animation. It apparently expands the perimeters of
a type of animated feature pioneered at the Disney Studio that
offers a so-called ``illusion of life''; that is, a film in which
the characters and settings are so convincing that one forgets that
the very real drama being witnessed is made from
ultra-representational drawings.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, ``Prince'' shows how much artistic leeway there is
yet to be explored in the relatively new art form of animation, and
even within the Disney formula. When, for example, might we go the
opposite direction from naturalism to see expressionism used in the
creation of, say, a film noir animated feature? Or when might there
be a totally abstract animated feature, a form that the painter and
animator Oskar Fischinger envisioned 60 years ago?
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Katzenberg discussed his project's departure
from the norm and his ``ambitions and dreams'' for the medium of
animation, which he laments has come to mean only ``a fairy tale
for children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, animation is a device, a technique for telling a
story,'' he explained, and proceeded to suggest the kind of
animated fare that could be expected from Dreamworks in the future.
``I'd love to take the medium of animation and make a movie like
`Indiana Jones,' a bigger-than-life story. Animation is about
exaggeration. I'd like to do a story like `Terminator.' And I'd
love to do a movie like `Lawrence of Arabia.'''
</P>
<P>
   He expressed such ideas at the very first meeting that he,
Geffen and Spielberg had before Dreamworks was born. ``Steven said
to me, `Why don't you do ``The Ten Commandments''?' I sort of
looked at him speechless for a second and said, `What a great
idea.' David Geffen made it unanimous.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 350 artists, animators and artisans have toiled for
four years on ``Prince of Egypt.'' To assure accuracy (and, one
assumes, to avoid interest-group complaints), Dreamworks, said
Katzenberg, ``opened the doors and invited in hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds of scholars, theologians, archaeologists,
Egyptologists and biblical experts from the faith community all
over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg related an example of their help in the sequence in
which Moses and Tzipporah marry: ``Jethro, high priest of Midian,
presides over them, and he stepped on a glass. It was a wonderful
symbolic thing that, since a picture for us is literally better
than a thousand words, told you in the blink of an eye an important
story point. You saw the ceremony of marriage. The problem is the
glass-breaking custom symbolizes the destruction of the first
temple, which did not get built for another thousand years! We took
it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Another example: Schwartz's original lyrics for the song ``When
You Believe'' included the line ``You can work miracles when you
believe.'' Katzenberg started to hear ``on a fairly regular basis''
from the experts. ``Do you mean to say,'' he recalled them asking,
``that you human beings can work miracles? All you have to do is
believe? Because that in fact is sacrilegious, across every
religious group. There is no one who doesn't agree that it is not.
Of course, that isn't what we meant to say, so the lyrics now say,
`There can be miracles when you believe.'''
</P>
<P>
   The decision not to merchandise the film in licensed products
was also made at the earliest pre-Dreamworks meeting. ``David
Geffen had an incredible gut reaction and sensitivity,'' Katzenberg
recalled. ``He said if you're going to be honorable to doing a
faithful retelling of this story, you then can't turn around and
exploit it in a way that is demeaning to it.''
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't stopped the animators, irrepressible scamps that
they are, from imagining what toys and gimcracks ``The Prince of
Egypt'' might have yielded, from Red Sea shower curtains to a
Burning Bush night light.
</P>
<P>
   The creators of ``Prince'' would appear to have in mind an older
target audience than is usual for an animated feature; Katzenberg
concedes it's not for the under-7 crowd. ``It's just over their
heads,'' he said. ``It's too sophisticated in terms of the ideas
and demands it puts upon an audience for them to be able to enjoy
it and follow it and relate to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hickner, one of the directors, said he wouldn't be surprised if
the film is rated PG. ``Material like the death of the firstborn is
more mature than you might see in a G picture,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I asked how much input Spielberg had had in the film, and
Katzenberg laughed and answered: ``As much as I could get. To have
the greatest storyteller and filmmaker ever as a partner and a
resource is incomparable. His time was very limited, but when there
were key decisions and I felt we needed that objective eye, he was
always there.''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg was always there, too. Wells likens him to ``a
personal trainer who makes you lift those weights one more time.''
``When I've done and re-done a sequence and can't think what else
to do, he says, `Well, we've got to get that just a little bit more
emotional.' So you go back one more time and lo and behold you
actually can get it that bit more emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked what debt he felt he owed to Walt Disney, Katzenberg
fired back: ``Everything! Walt Disney was a genius. This was a man
who, 70 years ago, was making Mickey Mouse cartoons and one day
woke up and decided, I'm going to tell a full-length movie using
this technique. My 10 years at Disney was where I went to school. I
continue to admire and study and learn from the great work that is
continuing on there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am trying to do something that in my opinion is an homage to
that work,'' he said. ``It's just headed off onto a whole other
path.''

WHERE TO INVEST A WEALTH OF TALENTS?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANN POWERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a hazy August afternoon, Melissa Elliott _ singer,
songwriter, rapper and producer _ sat before a mammoth stereo
system in the offices of her record label, Elektra. She
contemplated a pile of compact disks, digital audio tapes and
promotional videos. Which would best demonstrate where this artist,
whom the world knows by her deceptively girlish family nickname of
Missy, is headed in the wake of her emergence, at 26, as a new
ideal of womanly black power?
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see,'' she murmured, the secretive smirk that adds to
her famous charm creeping over her cherubic face. There was her
first executive production, the soundtrack to the film ``Why Do
Fools Fall in Love.'' There were remixes she did for Paula Cole and
Janet Jackson, and four tracks she produced for the girl group
Total.
</P>
<P>
   There was the video for ``I Want You Back,'' her duet with
Melanie B. of the Spice Girls. And there was ``Make It Hot,'' the
debut by Nicole, the singer whose album has inaugurated Ms.
Elliott's Elektra imprint label, The Goldmind.
</P>
<P>
   This bounty did not even include Ms. Elliott's work with Whitney
Houston or her Gap ad or any souvenirs from her triumphant shows at
this summer's Lilith Fair. Nor did it offer any tracks from her
still-unfinished follow-up to ``Supa Dupa Fly,'' the 1997 CD that
made Ms. Elliott the reigning potentate of hip-hop cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me a week to make my last album,'' she said. ``I
didn't have a lot of stuff to do. Right now, I'm involved in so
many different projects that I just have to kind of slide my songs
in there as I go along.''
</P>
<P>
   Her second solo disk probably won't reach fans until January.
But Ms. Elliott doesn't crave that kind of attention. She prefers
to thrive behind the scenes. Sylvia Rhone, the president of East
West/Elektra Records, is her role model.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at Sylvia, and later down the line I want to be like
her,'' said Ms. Elliott. ``I want to have a big office with people
just running my whole thing, and me being the big CEO. So I try to
get involved in every aspect I can. I know a lot of stuff, but
there's so much more I've got to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rhone believes that Ms. Elliott can develop in any way she
wants. ``She has no barriers creatively,'' she said. ``She's taking
on the fusion of pop and the hip-hop-urban world, and fusion is the
future of our business. Anything goes right now, and that's what
inspires me about Missy. She is one artist willing to take
chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhythm-and-blues, now virtually inseparable from its rebel
offspring, hip-hop, is enjoying its highest commercial and artistic
peak in years, and Missy Elliott is a major part of its
advancement. She and her main collaborator, the producer Timbaland,
devised one of the first hip-hop-based hybrids to go beyond
grafting new raps over old melodies.
</P>
<P>
   Playing with speed and texture, replacing conventional vocal
expressiveness with a discreetly intimate style, sampling insect
calls or a baby's cry alongside soul standards, they concocted
their own vernacular. It paralleled similar innovations by European
electronic experimentalists Goldie and Tricky, but it was
distinctly American and pop.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is a blueprint frequently imitated. ``When people begin
to copy us, it doesn't offend us,'' Ms. Elliott said. ``It makes us
say we've got to try something new.''
</P>
<P>
   Her hunger for innovation _ in a two-hour interview, she used
the word ``different'' to describe herself 15 times _ places Ms.
Elliott within the tradition of ambitious producers like Prince and
Babyface. Yet her sex distinguishes her from that lineage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the female stars of black music have been vehicles for
men,'' says the critic Nelson George, a chronicler of black music
history. ``They are creations or adjuncts. For a woman to be in
commercial black music who writes and produces herself is highly
unusual. I don't want to say unprecedented, but it's definitely
refreshing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Elliott's actions speak volumes about her refusal to accept
limits; her lyrics follow suit. ``I think females can be strong,
but we're very vulnerable,'' she said. ``I love men, but we can't
be stupid. They're doing the things they do because we allow them
to do them. So evidently we're the dummies. I make a lot of songs
to indicate that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Elliott's liberating viewpoint made her a logical choice for
this year's Lilith Fair, and there she faced largely female, and
largely white, audiences. ``I love the Lilith Fair,'' she
exclaimed. ``I'm honestly saying that from the heart. Every show I
did was packed, and the fans were hyped. It made me feel so good to
get that love from the other side. It makes you feel that you've
accomplished more than you thought. I'm not just doing an urban
show; I'm universal now.''
</P>
<P>
   Such enthusiasm reveals another important breakthrough that Ms.
Elliott exemplifies. She is a very contemporary kind of crossover
artist, a black performer who appeals to myriad audiences without
tempering the racial content of her music.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Her lexicon of slang, her streetwise fashion and her weave of
intricate grooves and samples are unmistakably rooted in her
background, first as a child in Portsmouth, Va., and later as a
teen-age member of various cliques of hip-hop stars in
Philadelphia, Washington and New York.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Elliott takes those influences beyond their designated
boundaries without changing their flavor. She professes the hope
that the racial lines that implicitly determine musical categories
will one day simply become irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walking down the street, it's funny when Chinese people walk
up to me and say, `Oh, Missy, we love you,' '' she said. ``Or
people from Africa. I'm so blessed to have people from this state
or that, this nationality or that come up and say, `We love you.'
'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Her music is only the most noticeable aspect of what makes Ms.
Elliott so unusual. There is also her image. A round, dark-skinned
woman with short curls, Ms. Elliott does not fit the slinky
standards of the music-video babe. So she blew those rules away
like so many soap bubbles.
</P>
<P>
   In videos she made with the director Hype Williams, she wears
inflatable suits that simultaneously foreground her weight and make
it irrelevant; she makes outrageous faces and weird sounds,
undulating as she floats through fantastic landscapes as if she
were part of a new species of invertebrate humanoid. She may seem
cartoonish, but Ms. Elliott insists she is being true to her
reality.
</P>
<P>
   She does so by tapping into the serious side of humor, its
ability to topple assumptions. She is a playful sorceress who
changes the world to suit her proportions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people see me on TV, that's the inner side of Missy,''
Ms. Elliott said. ``The videos aren't creating a character for me.
I am a character myself. I won class clown in my yearbook. I'm a
fun person. I don't like a lot of negativity around.''
</P>
<P>
   Sexiness definitely factors into Ms. Elliott's idea of fun, and
she admires the honesty of her ribald friend and occasional
collaborator, the rapper Li'l Kim. But Ms. Elliott demonstrates her
own sexuality differently. Instead of playing the seductress, she
explores the introspective side of eroticism. This focus on her own
pleasure adds to the depth, and the allure, of her music.
</P>
<P>
   She is eager to pass on her sense of autonomy to younger women,
both artists and fans. Nicole Ray, 17, with a voice more seasoned
than her years, has benefited from Ms. Elliott's guidance since she
was 14. After hearing her sing at an informal meeting at her house,
Ms. Elliott decided that Nicole (as she calls herself
professionally) would be her first protegee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like, I've got to have her!'' she said. ``I didn't have
a label or a production company, but she stayed loyal. We would
catch the bus or her mother would drive us up to Philly, and we
would record demos. And I always told her, when I get my label, I
would help her.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Ms. Elliott is in that position, and she has already helped
Nicole gain her first Top 10 single, ``Make It Hot.'' She advises
the singer on every aspect of her career, from her image to her
finances and the content of her music.
</P>
<P>
   The songs on ``Make It Hot'' deal with sex and romance, subjects
that preoccupy 17-year-olds no matter what their parents want to
think. But they project confidence and integrity. One outstanding
track, ``Boy You Should Listen,'' stages an argument with a young
lover demanding sex; Nicole doesn't say never, but she insists that
he pay attention and wait until she's ready.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Elliott and Nicole wrote the song together, and the
collaboration balances the thrill of attraction with a message of
self-possession that, Ms. Elliott hopes, will both entertain and
educate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to beat people in the head, because if they're
not ready, they're not going to hear it,'' Ms. Elliott said. ``If I
say it in a song, they might get it better. Maybe coming home from
work, they're singing that song, and they're feeling it, and it's a
different feeling than if I was just talking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the way Ms. Elliott moves forward: sneak in when
nobody's looking, and break down another preconception.

ONE-OF-A-KIND GUIDE TO THE CITY HE LOVES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Joe Neumaier is an associate editor at Entertainment Weekly.  
 By JOE NEUMAIER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York City tour guide, writer and self-styled
bon vivant Timothy (Speed) Levitch recalls a bus tour of
international bankers he once led. ``It was on a fancy bus, with a
bar, furniture and 20 Russians living large, but the microphone was
minuscule,'' he said. ``It was weird to have such a fancy bus with
a lousy amp system. So I was holding the mike against my chest,
trying to figure out how I was going to work it. And suddenly there
was this throbbing throughout the bus, this beautiful sound with a
rhythm. And I realized it was my heartbeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately, it is Levitch's mission to lead his passengers
into the heart of the city, as evidenced by ``The Cruise,'' a
documentary, directed by Bennett Miller, that opens on Oct. 23 at
the Angelika Film Center. Throughout 1996, Miller followed Levitch
_ who was in his fifth year of leading double-decker loops of
Manhattan, first with Apple Tours, then the Gray Line _ and entered
into the extraordinary rhythm of the guide's life.
</P>
<P>
   Levitch's defiantly offbeat point of view is what fuels ``The
Cruise,'' making it about, yet not limited to, one man's connection
to his city. (Though with his shaggy hair, sing-song voice and
lived-in sports coat he might not be every tourist's idea of a
representative New Yorker.)
</P>
<P>
   Riders expecting a regulation ``now, on the left'' bus tour are
in for a real ride. In the film, Levitch veers between city savant
and mad street philosopher as he carries on a tumultuous affair
with New York (at one point, he recounts how he and Manhattan
``divorced'' the previous year; they have since reconciled, he
assures us).
</P>
<P>
   `` `The Cruise' is fascinating, in that it is a man discovering
himself as if in a mirror,'' said Jean Rouch, 81, the French
documentary maker whose ``Chronicle of a Summer'' (1961) introduced
the candid realism of cinema verite. ``And it shows a city the way
you would show a mistress you love but with a strange clown in
front.''
</P>
<P>
   In an emotionally naked moment on the Brooklyn Bridge, Levitch,
alone with Miller and the camera, launches into a rant against
people in his life, including his mother, whom he calls Mem: ``To
Leslie _ if you want to try and choke me when I was 7, that's fine,
but I'm going to find you.'' ``To Mem Levitch _ why don't you leave
me alone? I'm trying to lead something of a youthful existence
here!'' ``To Jen and Michelle _ that was supposed to be an orgy,
not a double date with me as a fifth wheel!''
</P>
<P>
   ``That day was a catharsis,'' Levitch said. ``Call it cinema
verite, call it documentary _ I call it human.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 31, first met Levitch, 28, when they were teen-agers
growing up in Westchester County, then ran into him again in 1994.
At that time, Miller, who had dropped out of New York University's
filmmaking program, was interested in shooting a full-length
documentary. He saw Levitch's relationship with the city as, he
said, ``a means to see and understand him, but that's just the
entrance point.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The film looks at somebody who has a lot to offer and yet is
totally anonymous in the universe,'' Miller continued. ``What it
says is, `This is someone worth looking at.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Levitch puts it this way: ``The city is a self-portrait of the
humanity that built it, that struggles in it, that lives in it. To
me, even the cracks in the sidewalk bespeak autobiography about my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't a story easily communicated to those who just want
their pictures taken in front of the right buildings. ``American
tourists are so desperate to turn this into an `American' city;
they can only see it as Louisville times 10, or Chicago times 2,''
said Levitch, who is now giving walking tours. ``They don't want to
deal with the fact that there are 115 languages happening daily on
these streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most important truism about Levitch's tours is that
style trumps reality. On the bus, he would alter population figures
depending on his mood, or disingenuously cram a dozen Greenwich
Village literati into a swath off Seventh Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Historical accuracy is a matter of taste,'' said Levitch, a
graduate of New York University's dramatic-writing program. Not
content to just show off the city, he tried to change his
passengers' lives, to share with them his personal philosophy,
called ``Cruising'' (from which the film takes its title),
embracing the beautiful, creative possibilities in every moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``History is not a destination on my tour; it's a foundation,''
he said.``We begin with it to go other places. And there were
plenty of people who asked for refunds on my tours. I learned early
that if I encroached too soon on their preconceived notions of the
tour, they'd become outraged.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some of the more bemused _ or outraged _ riders on the
double-decker, viewers tend to see in Levitch a kindred spirit. ``I
was floored that so many people in Los Angeles were excited to see
a black-and-white New York documentary about somebody they'd never
heard of,'' said Thomas E. Harris, programming director of the Los
Angeles Independent Film Festival, where the film made its debut in
April.
</P>
<P>
   Alla Verlotsky, managing director of the New York Documentary
Festival, which showed ``The Cruise'' in May, said he appreciated
``the romance and nostalgia of it, especially Speed's image of the
city that doesn't exist anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vision of New York in it is very much about all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The affinity sometimes goes further. ``People have said after
screenings, `I am Speed,' '' said Miller. Yet there are shifting
Speeds: in early scenes, he's an oddball, nasally singing
Gershwin's ``But Not for Me'' and speaking of how architecture,
aristocracy and infidels coalesced to create a metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   As Miller tours his subject's life, Levitch's itinerant life
style is revealed (apartmentless, he has slept on friends' couches
for six years), as is his hobby of sneaking onto the roofs of
landmark buildings; his prolific, unpublished writing (40 plays and
10 novels, by Levitch's count), and a 72-hour jail stay (in the
film, he doesn't reveal the felony charge that landed him there).
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Levitch considered quitting the double-decker life
_ and Miller was ready to roll with that, too. ``The bus is
beautifully cinematic, but what I was trying to capture had nothing
to do with where Speed was working,'' he said. ``I was documenting
this person's soul.''
</P>
<P>
   For Levitch, the more than 100 hours of digital video (edited
down to 76 minutes) gave him ``the chance to adventure back to
myself,'' he said. ``Being a tour guide is one of the great
opportunities for self-expression, and being a tourist is one of
the great ways to fall in love with a place or person. And we are
all tourists.''
</P>
<P>
   Late in the film, Levitch spins in dizzying circles at the base
of the World Trade Center, then lies flat on his back on the
concrete, gazing up at the 1,350-foot-high twin towers.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said, ``At that moment, you catch this amazing emotional
tie that a human being can have to the city in which he lives, and
how it is a part of him.''

A LOVING CELEBRATION OF ALL THAT'S FOSSE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Mindy Aloff is the dance critic of The New Republic.  
 By MINDY ALOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gwen Verdon and Ann Reinking are two of the most respected
performers to star on the American musical-comedy stage in modern
times. And Bob Fosse, the choreographer and director, famously
loved both women, as individuals and as artists, showcasing them
indelibly onstage and on screen.
</P>
<P>
   Since Fosse's death in 1987 at the age of 60, Ms. Verdon and Ms.
Reinking have gone to the wall to insure that the spirit of the man
they knew would be kept vividly alive. This season, they have
collaborated as part of a team that is bringing ``Fosse: A
Celebration in Song and Dance'' to Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   The show (previews begin on Dec. 26 at the Broadhurst Theater,
where it opens on Jan. 14) offers an array of stripped-down images
from the works of an artist who could never stop creating. Directed
by Richard Maltby Jr., ``Fosse'' stars Valarie Pettiford, Jane
Lanier and such well-known dancers as Desmond Richardson and Scott
Wise.
</P>
<P>
   In separate interviews, Ms. Verdon's and Ms. Rein-king's
dedication to Fosse was rivaled only by their mutual affection.
``Her mind and her memory are like no one's I've ever known,'' Ms.
Reinking said of Ms. Verdon. ``She's not only a fantastic teacher
and director; in looking through all the tapes of her movies and
television work and stuff for Jack Cole at MGM, I saw that her
technique and her performing ability then was better than anybody's
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Fosse's work and Ms. Reinking, Ms. Verdon said:
``She understands his elegance and attention to detail. Annie has
choreographed her own ballets for ballet companies, has recreated
and rechoreographed Broadway shows for touring companies, and has
been a performer herself. Nobody else knows the 37 dancers'' _
there is a cast of 27 in ``Fosse,'' with 10 in reserve _ ``crew,
dressers, orchestra and the backstage technicians who work with all
that equipment. That's like four baseball teams! And these are
people with a fabulous pride in what they can contribute because of
their experience. You want their pride; you want their ego. She's
the only one.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Verdon, who married Fosse in 1960, was his third wife.
Though they ultimately separated, they never divorced, remaining
friends and collaborators. In 1987 he collapsed in her arms on a
street corner, stricken by his third, and fatal, heart attack. Ms.
Reinking, his principal companion for a time during the 1970s, was
perhaps, as his biographer Martin Gottfried suggests, the woman
closest to him, after those in his immediate family.
</P>
<P>
   The careers of all three are inextricably intertwined. Ms.
Verdon was the muse and leading lady of many of Fosse's Broadway
successes, from ``The Pajama Game'' (1954) through ``Chicago''
(1975), and for the duration of their marriage she proved his soul
mate in the rehearsal studio _ as coach, notator and embodiment of
dance memory.
</P>
<P>
   Among the dancers she taught parts was Ms. Reinking, whose
performing credits include Fosse's ``Chicago'' (1977) and a revival
of ``Sweet Charity'' (1986). She choreographed and also starred in
the current revival of ``Chicago'' on Broadway. In the program for
``Fosse,'' she is listed as the co-director and co-choreographer.
Ms. Verdon is the show's artistic adviser, assisted by the dancer
Nicole Fosse, her daughter with Fosse and his only child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fosse'' had its world premiere last month at the Ford Center
for the Performing Arts in Toronto. It is to play at the Colonial
Theater in Boston this month and then make a stop at the Ahmanson
Theater in Los Angeles from Oct. 9 to Dec. 6 before coming to New
York. (``Fosse'' will be the third show on Broadway this season to
have been originally choreographed by Fosse, the others being
``Little Me'' and the long-running ``Chicago.'')
</P>
<P>
   In Toronto, ``Fosse'' ran slightly under three hours, with two
intermissions. Those involved say it will continue to be refined on
the road.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in Toronto one could see aspects of its template.
``Dancin' '' was strongly evoked. Six of the nearly 30 numbers are
revived from that earlier revue. (The musical arrangements are
supervised by Gordon Lowry Harrell, who first served Fosse as
musical arranger and conductor for the original production of
``Dancin.' '') Other shows represented include ``Chicago,''
``Pippin,'' ``Cabaret,'' ``Damn Yankees'' and ``The Pajama Game.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, the director of movie musicals and former
dancer Stanley Donen _ a friend of Fosse's for three decades and
his colleague on the films ``Damn Yankees,'' ``The Pajama Game''
and ``The Little Prince'' _ talked about the choreographer's style:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard-edged. It's real. It's earthy. It's dynamic. It's
extraordinarily theatrical. It's very American, full of unique
movement. Its movements are small and very meaningful, in contrast
to violent moods _ the way he uses the hand, the way he holds his
hat, with the wrist against the forehead, the fingers just so.
</P>
<P>
   Fosse thrived on what other people call awkward positions; his
are wonderful and full of style. He was all detail. His dancers
don't come out and smile at the audience, either. He imparts an
attitude for each particular moment of dance.'' Fosse, he added,
``was a great, great, great artist.''
</P>
<P>
   How does Fosse's movement feel from the inside? Four of the
performers talked about their participation in the show. Of the
four, Ms. Lanier and Ms. Pettiford had worked with Fosse, while
Richardson and Wise come from pure dance backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Wise, the oldest, is nearing 40; he and Ms. Lanier (who is
married to one of Fosse's close friends, the actor John Rubinstein)
both have children. The performers' range of ages and backgrounds
reflects a concern of Ms. Reinking's, who insisted on such a mix _
especially on the dimension of maturity _ to give the ``Fosse''
cast texture and depth.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Richardson described the interior geography of his
solo, ``Percussion 4'' from ``Dancin' '': ``It's indicative of a
man who comes into a studio. He's got aches and pains. He's looking
in a mirror all the time. He's checking out his line. It's
percussive and continuous, so your adrenalin is rising. And it has
levels of energy, seamless transitions and great intensity.
Basically, the steps were given to me the way they were originally
taught, and I was free to bring nuance to them.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Wise said there was always an intent and a focus, akin to
acting, in Fosse's work: ``There's never a mindless step. I
approach it as an acting piece. Fosse said he knew about seven
different steps, but they were different each time.''
</P>
<P>
   Detailed role-playing is required for the many songs in
``Fosse.'' Ms. Lanier said: ``When Bob was working with us on `Big
Spender' in `Sweet Charity,' I was reminded that he was
Meisner-trained. He said to us girls, `Some of you do after hours,
and some don't. You decide.' It was all about the acting.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reinking's transitions and mini-ballets were worked out on
the dancers themselves. Other numbers have been reconstructed
separately, some of them many years ago by the dancer and
choreographer Chet Walker, who conceived the idea of a Fosse
retrospective and proposed it to Fosse during the 1986 revival of
``Sweet Charity.''
</P>
<P>
   After Fosse's death, Walker persevered. For several years during
the mid-90s, he conducted classes in Lower Manhattan for Broadway
dancers, and he so impressed Ms. Verdon with his efforts that she
joined in and helped him teach the repertory. Both donated their
labor to the project. About four years ago, Ms. Verdon invited Ms.
Reinking to attend the sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was deeply touching,'' Ms. Reinking said. ``I saw the
choreography was timeless, classic. It came from another era and
was not dated.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Ms. Verdon who recommended Ms. Reinking's services to
Garth H. Drabinsky, whose Livent company in Toronto took over
development of ``Fosse'' in 1996. (The current investigation into
Livent's accounting practices and the suspension of Drabinsky, the
company's co-founder and impresario, have not affected the
organization's support of ``Fosse'' or the show's opening on
Broadway, according to Roy Furman, Livent's chairman.)
</P>
<P>
   Walker said the show's basic content reflected selections by
himself and Ms. Verdon, although others, including Drabinsky, had
some influence on it. The three acts of ``Fosse'' are organized
thematically in part by Maltby, who won a Tony Award in 1978 for
his direction of the Fats Waller revue, ``Ain't Misbehavin.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in New York, Maltby said that at first he had
turned down Drabinsky, who nonetheless invited him to Toronto to
look at a workshop. ``An amazing thing happened,'' Maltby said. ``I
began to see that my judgment of Fosse's work was incorrect. Like
most people, I thought it was all about the style, the fingers,
turned-in knees. Instead, I saw that it was about
(italics)emotion(end italics) being expressed in a style.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reinking observed: ``Bob was very influenced by Bertolt
Brecht and Kurt Weill. That huge type of creativity which takes
nothing and makes it into something very wrenching. The one thing I
wanted to do was to create an air of quiet mystery. Fosse would say
that it's important to trust silence. He very much liked the use of
the tacit, or silent, count, where nothing is happening. He also
liked percussion. His is a world of angular movement and mystery,
quiet, semi-taciturn and percussive. I wanted to draw people into
his world.''
</P>
<P>
   Would she characterize that world? Ms. Reinking considered for a
moment, then spoke of a detail from ``Sweet Charity,'' whose title
role, created for Ms. Verdon, was also performed by Ms. Reinking.
``He made Gwen wear a tattoo of a heart on her arm in that show,''
Ms. Reinking said. ``And he wore his heart on his own sleeve. He
covered it up, but he kept on going.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to a similar question, Ms. Verdon said: ``There are
so many facets to this choreography and to its vocabulary of
movement. It's funny. It's sexy. It's quick. It's Romantic. There's
so much detail. And you have such a sense of accomplishment _ when
you're finally able to accomplish it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pettiford had said that when one gets the movement, it's the
best feeling in the world. Ms. Verdon agreed, with a caveat: ``When
I did the show `Redhead,' which played in New York for 22 months
and then toured, only six performances came together. Six!
Performances when I sang well and danced well. When I did it
right.''

AN EARLY LESSON IN SELF-CONFIDENCE PAYS OFF  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JUSTINE ELIAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Monica Potter's first brush with success happened
half a lifetime ago in her hometown, Cleveland, when she was a
13-year-old actress in a local television commercial. With
awestruck sincerity, she described the manifold uses of a silicon
spray, a product that could shine, unstick or otherwise improve
practically any household item.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played the daughter in a perfect family, but the ad had no
budget, no wardrobe, nothing,'' recalled Ms. Potter, who made her
small-screen debut wearing an outfit borrowed from friends. ``If I
could find that tape, I think I'd die laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from her more recent film performances, though, the
actress, now 27, may have been a great deal more persuasive than
she is letting on.
</P>
<P>
   In her first movie, ``Without Limits,'' which opened Friday, she
portrays the real-life character of Mary Marckx, a devoutly Roman
Catholic college student in love with the Olympic track star Steve
Prefontaine, who died in a car crash in 1975 at the age of 24.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Towne, who directed the film and wrote it with the
sportswriter and Olympic runner Kenny Moore, compares Ms. Potter to
Julia Roberts, whom she resembles, and Cameron Diaz, actresses who
are so in touch with their own sensibilities that their acting is
not so much reacting as it is reflexive _ quick and funny.
</P>
<P>
   In the British comedy ``Martha, Meet Frank, Daniel and
Laurence,'' to be released here next year, Ms. Potter plays a
Minnesota woman seeking a new life in London. Towne said he
recently heard from Kenneth Branagh, who predicted, ``When `Martha,
Meet Frank, Daniel and Laurence' opens in the U.S., I think she's
going to be the biggest star you've got.''
</P>
<P>
   At Christmas, she'll be seen starring with Robin Williams in
``Patch Adams,'' a comedy about unlikely medical school classmates.
Another of her completed films, ``A Cool, Dry Place,'' with Vince
Vaughn and Joey Lauren Adams, has no release date yet.
</P>
<P>
   But three years ago, when Towne was casting ``Without Limits,''
Ms. Potter's only dramatic experience was a two-month stint on
``The Young and the Restless.'' ``With a new face, in a
biographical film, you feel you are really seeing the people who
lived,'' said Towne. ``But after a fresh, spontaneous first
reading, once they step onto the set, inexperience and anxiety
might make them freeze.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Billy Crudup, Towne's choice to be Prefontaine, had
little film experience then, he was a confident stage performer who
had won acclaim on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see Monica, an unknown, react with so much self-assurance
and poise, opposite an actor who is a star in his own world _ on
stage _ really gives you a sense of the dynamic between these two
characters that an established actress never could,'' said Towne.
``The real Mary had a will and a stubbornness that matched his.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said of Ms. Potter, who says she knew at the
age of 3 that she wanted to act. ``I was lucky,'' she said. ``I
didn't have to sit and mull over what I wanted for my future. There
were no other options.''
</P>
<P>
   She began working as a child model and actress after her father,
an inventor, and her mother, a secretary, sent photos of their four
daughters to a local talent agent. ``We weren't wealthy, so I used
the money to pay my high school tuition.'' After graduation, she
moved to Chicago, then Miami, working as a model and commercials
actress, before heading to Los Angeles, where she lives with her
husband, a construction contractor, and their two sons.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some less than desirable assignments along the way _
like a role on a short-lived children's variety show made in Peru _
Ms. Potter managed to remain optimistic about her chances in
Hollywood. It was a chewing-gum advertisement, made for European
television, that proved to be her lucky break: the director of the
commercial was the French filmmaker Luc Besson (``The Fifth
Element''), who arranged Ms. Potter's first meeting at the top film
agency that now represents her.
</P>
<P>
   Besson said, ``I'm sending you to CAA.'' Continuing the anecdote
with a smile, Ms. Potter said: ``At the time I had no idea who they
were. I actually said, `Are they any good?' ''

RECHARGED FOR FALL: IN FRANCE, THEY CALL IT LA RENTREE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ In the wonderfully strict cycles of life that make the
French seem so predictable, la rentree first announces itself each
year as a reason to postpone things. From early July, there is
little that cannot await the return _ la rentree _ to Paris in
September.
</P>
<P>
   But, take note, this is not a symptom of laziness. It is simply
part of the French order of things. Parisians hold parties to say
goodbye for the summer in the knowledge that social, cultural,
political and business life will resume with a vengeance a la
rentree.
</P>
<P>
   So now, once again, Parisians are back, hurriedly recovering
control of their city from tourists, adding frowns of impatience to
still-bronzed faces, crowding restaurants that felt no need to stay
open in August to serve foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   In every sense, a new season has arrived _ and all of it
meticulously linked to la rentree. The school year has begun (la
rentree scolaire), government and opposition are again squabbling
(la rentree politique), businessmen are back at their desks (la
rentree economique), new art exhibitions and stage productions are
opening (la rentree culturelle) and hundreds of new books are out
(la rentree litteraire).
</P>
<P>
   True, it could be argued that this phenomenon is no longer
exclusive to Paris or even France. Since most inhabitants of Rome,
Madrid, Amsterdam, Munich, London and beyond now also do major
disappearing acts from their cities in the summer, they too return
en masse.
</P>
<P>
   And while New Yorkers may still exhibit a touching mixture of
envy and disapproval of Europe's long vacations, ``after Labor
Day'' has taken on a good number of the attributes of ``apres la
rentree.'' Yet Paris remains the benchmark because this is where it
all began.
</P>
<P>
   What began?
</P>
<P>
   Well, there would be no great rentree without a great depart.
And it is this programmed exodus that the French claim as their own
invention. It began in the 1930s with the introduction of the first
guaranteed paid holidays for workers, and by the 1950s ``dead
August'' had become a celebration of the French art de vivre.
Amusingly, when Germans, Britons, Dutch and other northern
Europeans first decided to imitate the French, they too did it a la
francaise, traipsing to the beaches of the Cote d'Azur or wining
and dining in the bucolic villages of Provence. Today, they also
crowd hilltops and resorts in Italy, Spain and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   Britain appears to be the latest country to institutionalize
``dead August,'' thanks, it seems, to Prime Minister Tony Blair,
who more or less took the phone off the hook at 10 Downing Street
and spent the entire month in Italy and France (although he was
forced to return home briefly after the bombing in Omagh, Northern
Ireland, on Aug. 15).
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, he was merely following in the footsteps of
Britain's well-heeled and chattering classes. But London was
emptier than ever. Last month, with his traditional clientele away,
Sir Terence Conran, the design mogul, was offering $16 fixed-menu
lunches or dinners at five of his glitzy restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   It was even possible to get a table without name-dropping at the
Riverside Cafe and the Pharmacy, two of London's most fashionable
eateries. So now even London is creating the conditions for une
rentree.
</P>
<P>
   The world of culture, though, does not rest. Visitors to Paris
still want to visit the Louvre. American tourists in London still
consider West End theaters to be among the city's main appeals.
Indeed, three musicals _ ``Whistle Down the Wind,'' ``Dr.
Dolittle'' and ``Oklahoma!'' _ opened in London in July.
</P>
<P>
   But even more important, as residents of major European cities
disperse, artists and performers now increasingly accompany them,
thanks to the staggering number of music, theater and other
festivals that have grown up in recent years. Salzburg, Bayreuth,
Avignon, Aix-en-Provence, Edinburgh and Glyndebourne may still have
the best known festivals, but the arts are now well entrenched as a
tourist attraction throughout Europe.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   London's cultural rentree can in fact be tagged apres Edinburgh.
``Cultural life in Britain is like water in a bath,'' Robert
Hewison, a British cultural historian, explained. ``The water is
usually in London. Then, for three weeks in August and early
September, it all rushes to Edinburgh for television, film, theater
and music festivals. There's no point in opening anything in London
in August. Only the Promenade concerts at the Albert Hall keep
going. But theater life is planned entirely around the autumn
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Spring and summer in Europe and the United States are, of
course, fall and winter in the Southern Hemisphere, which means
that cultural seasons are also upside-down. For instance, the
season at the Teatro Colon, the legendary opera house in Buenos
Aires, runs from April through December, when seemingly the entire
city moves in a French-like depart to the beach at Punta del Este
in neighboring Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
   This calendar has its advantages: when Europe's opera houses are
closed, the Colon can draw big names (Placido Domingo and Mirella
Freni sang Giordano's ``Fedora'' there last month).
</P>
<P>
   In countries where the weather is warm year-round and neither
depart nor rentree is called for, there is often no cultural season
worth mentioning. Could it be that culture was invented by
Europeans to get through the winter? Could it be that winter
resorts were invented to enable them to escape cultural overdose?
Still, as surely as colder weather is approaching, the Northern
Hemisphere's cultural program is going into gear.
</P>
<P>
   Paris jump-starts the season faster than some. In Milan, for
instance, the opera season at La Scala traditionally opens early in
December, while the Royal Shakespeare Company only starts its
London season at the Barbican Center in November.
</P>
<P>
   But in Paris, from the Comedie Francaise to the Paris Opera,
from the Musee d'Orsay to the Folies-Bergere, cultural life is now
already stirring. And through early December, a fall festival, the
Festival d'Automne a Paris, is presenting productions and
performers from around the world, with China providing this year's
central theme.
</P>
<P>
   As the days grow shorter, much the same thing is happening in
all the major cities of the Northern Hemisphere, from Vienna to
Chicago. New York's version of the fall festival in Paris, for
example, is the Next Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of
Music.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere, a sort of bidding war breaks out as new plays,
movies, dance and opera productions, art exhibitions and books
compete for people's time and attention. Suddenly everything has to
be squeezed in _ school life, business life, social life and
cultural life. The rush of energy is tangible.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in Paris, perhaps because the French invented the concept,
la rentree is an event unto itself. Marking the end of the biggest
disruption of normal life each year, it means that le tout Paris is
now back in town, that phones are answered, dinner invitations
accepted, gossip avidly exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is as important to have a good rentree as a good
vacation. In true Cartesian fashion, it is there to be measured and
judged. And this includes the quality of la rentree culturelle.
What new movies have you seen? Have you caught the show at the
Musee d'Orsay?
</P>
<P>
   ``No one would think of publishing a new book here in July or
August,'' said Susanna Lea, an editor at Editions Robert
Laffont/Fixot. ``Then a tidal wave comes in September, linked to
the year-end literary prizes, like the Goncourt. People ask each
other, `What did you read of la rentree?' La rentree litteraire is
critical, above all for fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, of course, it is too early to gauge the quality
of this year's rentree, at least in the arts. But la rentree
mentale, the crucial behavioral adjustment that takes place at this
time every year, has already happened.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, perhaps no more than in London, Berlin and New York,
there is a new buzz in the air, a quickening of step, an eagerness
to make a fresh start. So what's special about la rentree? Well, as
ever, the French have found le mot juste to describe it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Luxury automobiles used to be the domain of wealthy
doctors, lawyers and business executives _ along with show-business
celebrities and mob bosses.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, these vehicles have proliferated even as the
ranks of economy cars have dwindled. Some of this is because of
``luxury creep,'' as features once found only on a Mercedes-Benz or
Lincoln Town Car have filtered into Hondas and Subarus.
</P>
<P>
   And part of it is a redefining of the luxury car market, thanks
to baby boomers' advancing age and growing affluence; in middle
age, many boomers have avoided the Cadillac DeVilles favored by
their parents or grandparents, but they like smaller, leaner,
sportier cars like the Cadillac Catera.
</P>
<P>
   Marketers call these ``near luxury'' or ``entry luxury'' cars,
and their ranks include the BMW 3-Series, the Lexus ES300 and the
Mercedes C280. It is the fastest-growing segment of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Such cars had been defined as costing roughly $25,000 to
$35,000. Now, some so-called luxury cars push below $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   The latest newcomer to lower-priced luxury is the 1999 Infiniti
G20. It was sold in the 1991-96 model years, but was then dropped.
In July, the G20 returned to the lineup of Nissan's luxury division
as a fourth Infiniti model, joining the flagship Q45, the I30 sedan
and the QX4 sport utility.
</P>
<P>
   Intended as a fun-to-drive sport sedan with luxury touches, the
new G20 is aimed at 25- to 50-year-old owners of mainstream,
high-volume midsize cars who may want something with more cachet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To call the 1999 Infiniti G20 all new is somewhat misleading.
Many of the parts have been carried over from the
previous-generation G20, and most of the changes are quite subtle.
</P>
<P>
   The updated G20 looks strikingly similar to the original, though
the wedge shape is more pronounced, the nose is more slanted and
the deck lid is higher. The revised grille and jewel-like headlamps
more closely resemble the flagship Q45 and the midrange I30.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is handsome in a generic way, the G20 is no styling
standout, in keeping with the safe, staid designs Nissan has been
churning out in recent years. Not a single person commented on the
G20 during two weeklong test drives of both the standard model and
the sporty G20t ``touring edition,'' though the G20t flashed bright
red paint, rather gaudy lower-body cladding and a rear deck-lid
spoiler.
</P>
<P>
   The new G20, based on the Primera sold in Europe and Japan,
rides on a 102.4-inch wheelbase, two inches longer than its
predecessor's. The overall length, at 177.5 inches, is more than
two inches longer as well. The G20 is a bit roomier than its prime
competitors, the Audi A4 and BMW 318i, but its various interior
dimensions represent only a scant improvement over the previous
Infiniti.
</P>
<P>
   The cabin also closely resembles the old G20. The materials are
of high quality, as one expects from a Japanese auto maker. The
black leather of the tested G20t was slightly gathered on the seats
and the door insets for an elegant look. Panels fitted together
beautifully, and the finishes were superb. Controls were logical,
and one can easily operate the large knobs for the climate control
and audio system even when wearing gloves.
</P>
<P>
   The instrument panel gauges are of the traditional
black-on-white variety for easy reading. And the G20 comes with a
full plate of luxury amenities.
</P>
<P>
   Even the base model has a 100-watt Bose audio system with AM/FM
radio, CD and cassette players and six speakers. The G20t has
low-profile performance tires, viscous limited-slip differential
and fog lights, in addition to its cosmetic enhancements.
</P>
<P>
   The only major options on either car are an automatic
transmission and a package that includes leather upholstery, power
driver's seat, power moonroof, automatic temperature control and a
Homelink transmitter that can open gates and garage doors.
</P>
<P>
   Safety features on the G20 include dual front air bags, side air
bags and three-point seat belts for all passengers, including the
one in the rear middle seat.
</P>
<P>
   The G20's front seats were extremely comfortable, though the
back seats seemed a bit too firm. The rear seat folds down to
provide access to the truck for extra cargo space. At 14.2 cubic
feet, the trunk is quite roomy, especially compared with the small,
10-cubic-foot trunk of the BMW 3-Series sedan. Unfortunately,
storage is limited in the cabin. Molded pockets in the front doors
accommodate small items like maps, guidebooks or cassettes, but
back-seat passengers have only pockets in the back of the front
seats. The glove box will hold little besides the leather-bound
operating manual.
</P>
<P>
   While the front-wheel-drive G20 is pleasant to drive, its
performance doesn't quite live up to its billing as a luxury sport
sedan. I had expected more, since the luxury division began its
life by carving out a high-performance niche.
</P>
<P>
   Like other recent Infiniti models, the G20 seems to have strayed
from that mission. After the latest Q45 moved toward the
mainstream, Toyota's Lexus division picked up the slack with its
high-performance GS models.
</P>
<P>
   The new G20 is powered by the old car's engine, a four-cylinder
power plant with 16 valves and dual overhead cams, though changes
have reduced emissions and noise. The same 140-horsepower engine
made the Sentra SE-R a pocket rocket, but that car was
significantly lighter. The G20 has gained a few pounds because of
its luxury features and the added metal for protective side-door
beams.
</P>
<P>
   The G20 is noticeably shy of power especially in passing
maneuvers and takeoffs from a dead stop. In its track testing, Car
and Driver magazine clocked the G20 as moving from 0 to 60 miles an
hour in a fairly sluggish 10.9 seconds, significantly slower than
the lower-priced Volkswagen Passat GLS or Acura Integra LS.
</P>
<P>
   If that is fast enough for you, you're likely to find that the
G20's sophisticated suspension strikes a pleasant balance of
comfortable ride and road-gripping handling, and the car is a joy
to drive on curving roads.
</P>
<P>
   The standard five-speed manual, with its smooth shifts and short
throws, adds to the fun. Four-wheel anti-lock disk brakes make
stops smooth, quick and confident.
</P>
<P>
   The G20 starts at about $21,000, not much more than the average
American automobile, and the fully equipped G20t is around $25,000.
Stacked up against the A4 or the BMW 323i (the four-cylinder BMW
318i sedan has been discontinued for 1999), the G20 looks like a
pretty fair deal.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, even the most basic G20 allows its owner to be
pampered at Infiniti dealerships, which customer surveys have long
ranked among the best in the business.

<P>
   CUAUTLA, Mexico _ Carmen Genis flipped open her cellular
telephone and punched in a private number few citizens possess in
this corruption-weary state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this my governor?'' Genis asked politely but without
deference. ``Governor, I don't want to waste time . . . We must do
something to clean up the police.''
</P>
<P>
   A businesswoman and feisty community activist, Genis is one of
the more aggressive leaders of a citizens' movement against
corruption and crime that is flourishing in Morelos state, just
south of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Outrage over crime -- too often committed by people charged with
preventing it _ is spreading through Mexico, where almost daily the
public is treated to new revelations about crooked police chiefs,
corrupt bankers and dirty politicians. The suspects are accused of
fleecing public funds or protecting criminals for their own gain.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has always suffered from corruption, said Augusto Sanchez
Sandoval of Mexico City's National Institute of Criminal Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is more clarity now because opposition parties are
stronger and are uncovering what's been going on for years,'' he
said. ``From total darkness we are now getting pinpoints of
light.''
</P>
<P>
   In August, a survey on Mexican justice published by the Mexico
City newspaper Reforma showed that 54 percent of those people
polled thought the government was having no success at stopping
corruption. Only 5 percent said the government was doing a lot.
</P>
<P>
   The Berlin-based anti-corruption group Transparency
International placed Mexico as the sixth most corrupt country out
of 52 nations on its 1997 Corruption Perception Index. The index is
based on surveys of international business people's experiences and
countries' effectiveness at fighting corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Morelos, ground zero for Mexico's anti-corruption sentiment, is
a small province that takes pride in its pleasant weather and its
native son, Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata. But lately the
state has also become infamous as a den for corrupt authorities who
have looked the other way or participated in organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   The most notorious of these crimes are kidnappings, not just of
wealthy businessmen but also of ordinary citizens forced to scrape
together ransom money to free loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   It was Morelos where Mexico's most notorious kidnapper, Daniel
Arizmendi, thrived. Once a Morelos cop, he is now in custody after
federal officials arrested him and his gang last month.
</P>
<P>
   Also in custody in connection with kidnapping charges is the
chief of Morelos' anti-kidnapping police unit, Armando Martinez
Salgado, believed to have provided protection to Arizmendi.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Miyazawa Alvarez, chief of Morelos' state Judicial Police,
and the state's former attorney general, Carlos Peredo Merlo, have
also been charged with crimes in connection with kidnapping and
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, as scandal mounted in Morelos, citizens like Carmen
Genis and opposition political parties began to demand the ouster
of the state's governor, Jorge Carrillo Olea. Carrillo, a member of
the dominant Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI), had also been
linked to cocaine traffickers in press reports and in court
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   In March, opposition political groups staged a non-binding
referendum with 100,000 participants mostly demanding Carrillo's
resignation. After dismissing the vote as a stunt and attacking his
critics as troublemakers, Carrillo finally gave in. He resigned in
May without admitting wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Genis, a travel agent in Cuautla (pronounced: Kwowt-la), a small
city south of Morelos' capital, Cuernavaca, said her hometown has
been traumatized by police-supported crime and kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
   Driving down Cuautla's main avenue, she points at various store
fronts a hardware store, a fertilizer shop, a market that sells
chiles -- and describes how entire families have been kidnapped for
repeated ransoms.
</P>
<P>
   Many victims have gone broke paying ransoms or left town,
terrified of being targeted again or disgusted with Morelos'
lawlessness.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Mendoza, who was kidnapped from his family's store three
years ago when he was 21, says he'll never feel safe again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was working behind the counter when two men showed up,'' he
said. ``I saw them take guns out. They said, 'We're Judicial
Police. You are detained.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza doesn't think they were lying. He believes police were
involved in his kidnapping, although it was never proved. He was
held for 19 days and threatened with death unless his family paid
the equivalent of $18,000.
</P>
<P>
   Kidnappings haven't stopped since the arrest of Morelos' corrupt
top cops.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-July, Silvino Valdez and his family were working in their
modest seafood restaurant in the city of Jojutla, south of Cuautla.
</P>
<P>
   Six men entered the restaurant, brandished guns and dragged away
Valdez's 15-year-old son, Jaime. The kidnappers drove the boy to a
remote area, made him place his knees on a hot car engine and
burned his flesh nearly to the bone to prevent him from escaping.
</P>
<P>
   They tied the boy to a tree, and later placed him inside a cave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something like this is incomparable,'' said Valdez, his eyes
still dull from shock. ``These people hit you where you are
weakest,''
</P>
<P>
   The kidnappers demanded about $250,000 in ransom, but a
desperate Valdez begged the men to let his son go for close to
$40,000. He had to raise the money from friends and by selling his
two cars.
</P>
<P>
   Valdez called the police, who he said appeared not to care.
</P>
<P>
   Through his own research, Valdez discovered the kidnappers were
using the same phone booth to repeatedly place calls demanding
ransom. The police were asked to watch the booth, he said, but
never did their duty.
</P>
<P>
   Jaime was released after eight days.
</P>
<P>
   Eager for justice, Valdez asked a police officer to investigate
leads on cars and houses where Jaime had been held.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police officer came to my house and looked around the
place as if he were sizing it up, to see how much money I had,''
Valdez said. ``He told me I should just forget about it all, that
there wasn't anything they could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdez isn't sure if police were directly involved in his son's
kidnapping. But he believes one thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe if I had given them some money,'' he said bitterly,
``they would have done their job. But by that time I had no money
left to give them.''
</P>
<P>
   Genis became involved in the Morelos citizens group Civic Cause
after stories like this began circulating several years ago. She
estimates that some 400 kidnappings have taken place in Morelos,
many in the Cuautla area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found out these kidnappers were being protected,'' she
said. ``We became detectives.''
</P>
<P>
   She described how a family's home was invaded by masked men who
seized one of the members. The family summoned state police, only
to discover that the police ended up helping to load the kidnapping
victim into a car after the masked men identified themselves as
cops.
</P>
<P>
   Genis and others identified police cars that were seen at the
scene of kidnappings and safe houses that were used to hold
victims, and sent incriminating information to the governor's
office. The activists began to meet quietly with federal law
enforcement officials in Mexico City, imploring them to investigate
corrupt state cops and their association with criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an incredible symbiosis here,'' said Gerardo Becerra
of the left-center Democratic Revolution Party, whose members were
part of the campaign to oust the former governor.
</P>
<P>
   Genis regards Carrillo's resignation as an unprecedented victory
for a citizens' movement in Mexico. Now she's trying to work with
the newly appointed governor, pressuring him to probe the suspected
looting of public funds and continued police corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing is getting rid of the old governor. The other is
getting justice. And that hasn't changed,'' she said. ``Delinquency
continues intact.''
</P>
<P>
   Gubernatorial representatives in Morelos did not respond to
requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Genis said at least three kidnapping rings still operate in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Mexico's most wanted kidnapper, Daniel Arizmendi, is in
custody, Genis said, federal officials have said they will
concentrate on nabbing other criminals in Morelos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see what they do,'' she said.

   The last successful phase of the Oslo peace process occurred in
January 1997, with the Hebron agreement. Israeli troops withdrew
from most of the West Bank city of Hebron and Palestinians promised
to fight terrorism. Since then, the process has deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
   March 7, 1997: Deadline for next Israeli withdrawal passes after
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat scoffs at Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's offer to hand over 2 percent of
new West Bank land.
</P>
<P>
   March 14, 1997: Israeli cabinet approves plan for 6,500 Jewish
homes on Jerusalem hill known as Har Homa to Jews and Jabal Abu
Ghneim to Arabs. Israel captured the land in the 1967 war, but
Palestinians consider it theirs.
</P>
<P>
   March 21, 1997: Palestinian suicide bomber kills three Israeli
women in a Tel Aviv cafe.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   July 30, 1997: As U.S. envoy Dennis Ross tries to restart peace
talks, two Palestinian suicide bombers kill 17 Israelis in
Jerusalem's Mehaneh Yehuda produce market. Israel seals off borders
to Palestinian workers and calls off talks.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 4, 1997: Two weeks before U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright is to visit Israel, three Palestinian suicide
bombers kill four Israelis in Jerusalem's Ben Yehuda cafe district.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 12, 1997: Albright leaves Israel, reporting little
progress and saying she will not come back again to ``tread
water.''
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 1, 1997: Israel releases from prison Hamas founder Ahmed
Yassin at the demand of Jordanian King Hussein, who is outraged
that Israeli agents tried to kill a Hamas figure in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 8, 1997: With Yassin -- a rival to Arafat -- back in Gaza,
Arafat and Netanyahu hold a hastily arranged, pre-dawn, summit to
discuss security. This is the last time they have met.
</P>
<P>
   January 1998: Arafat and Netanyahu meet separately with
President Bill Clinton at the White House. No progress achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 1, 1998: Albright visits Israel again and reports no
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Early February 1998: U.S. promotes plan for Israel to turn over
13 percent more of the West Bank to the Palestinians as the next
step in the Oslo process. Arafat eventually accepts, Netanyahu does
not.
</P>
<P>
   March 10, 1998: A taxi van carrying Palestinian workers hits and
lightly injures an Israeli soldier at a checkpoint, soldiers open
fire and kill three, prompting riots.
</P>
<P>
   May 14, 1998: Four Palestinians are killed as they clash with

independence.
</P>
<P>
   July 19, 1998: For the first time in almost six months, top
Israeli and Palestinian officials meet.
</P>
<P>
   August 1998: In two attacks in the West Bank, Palestinians kill
two settlers in Itzhar and a rabbi in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 1, 1998: Deadline for another Israeli withdrawal passes
with no movement.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 9, 1998: U.S. Ambassador Dennis Ross visits in an attempt

</P>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ He has heard the demands from the Israeli government
and received training from the CIA, but is Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat fighting terrorism?
</P>
<P>
   It is a year since the last time suicide bombers sent nails and
terror ripping through an Israeli crowd, though several individual
murders have occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Operations have come down because of the huge crackdown (from
Arafat),'' said Ibrihim Gosheh, a spokesman in Jordan for the Hamas
extremist group that often takes credit for the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, opinions of Arafat's record vary widely.
</P>
<P>
   His police force is several thousand officers over what is
allowed under the Oslo accords, but analysts say that may help him
keep peace. He refuses to extradite terrorists to Israel, but
observers point out that he would not be required to if the
terrorists were tried by his authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Hamas is Arafat's political rival. If the peace process fails,
Hamas is vindicated and Arafat will be seen as having misled his
people.
</P>
<P>
   Ghassan Khatib, director of a Palestinian research group, said
that contrary to some claims, Arafat would not use Hamas bombings
to influence peace negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will never allow himself to become dependent on his
opponents,'' Khatib said.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians note that Israelis could not stop terror when they
controlled all the land.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has jailed some Hamas leaders, but Carmi Gillon, former
head of Israel's internal security force, said mostly he fights
terror by pressuring the families of the extremists. Arafat's
record has improved, he said, but it is not how Israelis fight
terror.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (Palestinians) think that if you put a Hamas member in
the police it will convince him not to be a terrorist,'' Gillon
said.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA trains Palestinian police in anti-terrorism and even on
securing its phone lines from Israeli listening devices, according
to Menachem Klein, a political scientist at Bar Ilan University.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said one of Arafat's security chiefs recently met with a
top terrorist leader -- a friend from their time in Israeli jails
-- and told him he would face stiff punishment if any terror was
committed.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Arafat
responds to specific threats, but does not break the terrorist
network -- he spears the fish one by one, rather than casting a
net.

COUNTING THE HOURS 
</HEADLINE>
  By ALEXANDER CHANCELLOR  
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON, Sept. 11 _ The resignation or impeachment of the
president now seems taken for granted in much of the European
press.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal story got more attention in Europe than in other
parts of the world, and much more in Britain than in other parts of
Europe. Rupert Murdoch's British tabloid, the Sun (circulation 4
million), carried a massive front-page headline, ``Clinton: The
Last Hours,'' and an editorial saying about the White House ``soap
opera,'' ``The world knows how the plot will end, and there are few
episodes left.'' But the Sun added that ``for all the personal
shame of Clinton, America can hold its head high. The land of the
free has upheld the finest democratic traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The political cartoonist of the Times of London showed the
American eagle stealing the arrows off the presidential seal and
defecating on Clinton's head as it flew away. The Financial Times
ran an editorial titled ``The Indignity of It All,'' blaming the
president fully for his misfortunes. ``His words are weasel ones,
his actions based forever on political expediency,'' it said. ``He
still appears to think that the affair is a right-wing conspiracy,
and he cannot see what he did wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The conservative Daily Telegraph ran a two page scandal
chronology compiled by Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, who, as its
Washington correspondent, began investigating Clinton in 1993 and,
according to the paper, was ``vilified by the White House aides''
as a result. ``Once the members of the judiciary committee have
examined the text [of the Starr report], in all its shocking and
prurient detail,'' Evans-Pritchard wrote, ``they will acknowledge
that the President is a borderline sociopath who must be removed at
once.'' In an editorial, the Telegraph described the president as
sitting ``in a political wheelchair.'' ``He may beat his breast. He
may blacken his opponents. His charm and theatrical abilities may
see him through for a bit longer, but it is, sadly, to no purpose.
He cannot save himself; he can only degrade his office further.''
</P>
<P>
   Le Monde of Paris restricted its editorializing Thursday to
publishing on its front page, under the rubric ``Point of View,''
the full text of Sen. Joseph Lieberman's speech to the Senate Sept.
3. Clinton didn't make the front page of Le Figaro, the
conservative Paris daily, but led the foreign news section under
the headline ``Clinton Paralyzed and Demoralized.'' The paper also
ran a short and unoriginal comment on the dilemmas facing Al Gore
as he comes daily closer to fulfilling his presidential ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, the story of the delivery of the Starr report was
touched upon only briefly on the front pages but was covered
extensively on the foreign pages. La Stampa of Turin ran a comment
by Gabriele Romagnoli, who asked why nobody has asked Clinton the
most important question: ``Mr. President, who the devil ordered the
bombing of Sudan and why?''
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, which is preoccupied with its own problems, and in
Australia, which has its mind on elections, the fate of the U.S.
presidency did not dominate the news, though the Sydney Morning
Herald ran a report Friday, headlined ``Lame duck looks like a
dying duck,'' from its Washington correspondent, Jennifer Hewett.

KILLING HIM WITH KINDNESS  
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID PLOTZ

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton is famously blessed by his enemies, and never
more than by the Republican House, whose splenetic viciousness
saved him in 1995. Since then, a chastened Gingrich &AMP; Co. have let
Clinton plow over them and have learned to (pretend to) be polite
and soft. Thursday was the day Republicans reaped the reward for
their years of mildness.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans of 1995, after all, would have posted Starr's
report on the Web in 15 minutes; opened impeachment hearings within
the hour; and tried to have him convicted, packed up, and out of
the White House by day's end.
</P>
<P>
   But since Starr dumped the report on the Hill, the Republicans
have been gushing comity and bipartisanship. Wednesday afternoon,
top House Republicans overflowed with high-mindedness. Judiciary
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, the kindly face of the GOP, was
trotted out to be avuncular. He pledged ``as much as humanly
possible to do this in a bipartisan fashion so that the country
will in the end be proud of us.'' House Majority Leader Dick Armey,
hardly famed for his nonpartisan spirit, warned ``any member who
believes that this is a time for partisan antics, more is the pity
for you. You have lost the sense of the duty and the honor of the
position you have.''
</P>
<P>
   The sobriety continued full throttle Thursday. Every other word
out of Republicans' mouths was ``bipartisan.'' (Hear it enough, and
you begin to believe it.) Gingrich took to the House floor Thursday
morning to propose ``rules of decorum'' for the report and to
caution colleagues to ``abstain from language that is personally
offensive to the president.'' Later, he went on CNN to preach more
restraint and to urge a deliberate process. Republicans promised to
give Democrats on the Judiciary Committee more resources and to
post the president's response to the Starr report on the Web. The
GOP appeared, in short, to be cooperative, reasonable, and
restrained.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is surely pinning his survival on the belief that the
deep-rooted partisanship and hatred of House conservatives will
boil to the surface, that they will rip off their masks and reveal
the lizards below, dooming impeachment. That may still happen. But
for one day, at least, the Republicans have discovered the virtue
of restraint. If they can control themselves like this for a few
more months and let the damning evidence present itself, they will
kill the president in the only way possible--softly.

THE FRAME GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM SALETAN 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several days ago, after Clinton's surrogates had spent months
undermining Kennetrh Starr's credibility by characterizing him and
his evidence, Clinton lawyer David Kendall sent Starr a letter
demanding that Starr give his report to Clinton well in advance of
its release, which would allow Clinton to put out his own spin
before Starr's.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides admitted that they expected Starr to reject
Kendall's request but that they made the request public because
they wanted the country to know that it had been made and rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Starr has rejected Kendall's request and has got the
jump on the White House by turning over his report to Congress,
Clinton's lawyers have asked congressional leaders to give Clinton
the same spin-preparation opportunity Starr denied them.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans turned down this request. The press
and the public will get to see Starr's report at the same time the
White House gets to see it, i.e., before the White House has a
chance to respond.
</P>
<P>
   In the short run, this means that Starr gets the first punch and
that Clinton's lawyers will have to scramble for answers in the
hours and days following the report's release. But in the long run,
the GOP's refusal of the preview request will become Exhibit A in
the Democrats' case against the legitimacy of the Clinton
impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   The assault is already underway. The impeachment process ``is
not getting off on the right start, in my view, if the person who
is most directly affected and can provide us with his own account
is denied the right to do so,'' Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle
told the press Thursday. The GOP's refusal, he warned, ``would
demonstrate an element of unfairness we're going to have to be very
concerned about.''
</P>
<P>
   This inference may strike Republicans as unfair, since Clinton
will get his chance to counterspin Starr's report anyway, once the
report is released. But as Kendall's recent PR tactics demonstrate,
``fairness'' is just another weapon in the struggle for political
advantage.

COUNTING THE HOURS 
</HEADLINE>
  By ALEXANDER CHANCELLOR  
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON, Sept. 11 _ The resignation or impeachment of the
president now seems taken for granted in much of the European
press.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal story got more attention in Europe than in other
parts of the world, and much more in Britain than in other parts of
Europe. Rupert Murdoch's British tabloid, the Sun (circulation 4
million), carried a massive front-page headline, ``Clinton: The
Last Hours,'' and an editorial saying about the White House ``soap
opera,'' ``The world knows how the plot will end, and there are few
episodes left.'' But the Sun added that ``for all the personal
shame of Clinton, America can hold its head high. The land of the
free has upheld the finest democratic traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The political cartoonist of the Times of London showed the
American eagle stealing the arrows off the presidential seal and
defecating on Clinton's head as it flew away. The Financial Times
ran an editorial titled ``The Indignity of It All,'' blaming the
president fully for his misfortunes. ``His words are weasel ones,
his actions based forever on political expediency,'' it said. ``He
still appears to think that the affair is a right-wing conspiracy,
and he cannot see what he did wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The conservative Daily Telegraph ran a two page scandal
chronology compiled by Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, who, as its
Washington correspondent, began investigating Clinton in 1993 and,
according to the paper, was ``vilified by the White House aides''
as a result. ``Once the members of the judiciary committee have
examined the text [of the Starr report], in all its shocking and
prurient detail,'' Evans-Pritchard wrote, ``they will acknowledge
that the President is a borderline sociopath who must be removed at
once.'' In an editorial, the Telegraph described the president as
sitting ``in a political wheelchair.'' ``He may beat his breast. He
may blacken his opponents. His charm and theatrical abilities may
see him through for a bit longer, but it is, sadly, to no purpose.
He cannot save himself; he can only degrade his office further.''
</P>
<P>
   Le Monde of Paris restricted its editorializing Thursday to
publishing on its front page, under the rubric ``Point of View,''
the full text of Sen. Joseph Lieberman's speech to the Senate Sept.
3. Clinton didn't make the front page of Le Figaro, the
conservative Paris daily, but led the foreign news section under
the headline ``Clinton Paralyzed and Demoralized.'' The paper also
ran a short and unoriginal comment on the dilemmas facing Al Gore
as he comes daily closer to fulfilling his presidential ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, the story of the delivery of the Starr report was
touched upon only briefly on the front pages but was covered
extensively on the foreign pages. La Stampa of Turin ran a comment
by Gabriele Romagnoli, who asked why nobody has asked Clinton the
most important question: ``Mr. President, who the devil ordered the
bombing of Sudan and why?''
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, which is preoccupied with its own problems, and in
Australia, which has its mind on elections, the fate of the U.S.
presidency did not dominate the news, though the Sydney Morning
Herald ran a report Friday, headlined ``Lame duck looks like a
dying duck,'' from its Washington correspondent, Jennifer Hewett.

 &HT;    ANALYSTS DISAGREE OVER CLINTON 'SEX ADDICT' DIAGNOSIS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (l) lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even before details of President Clinton's
extramarital sexual activity were made public, some mental health
professionals have concluded that the cravings that supposedly
steamed up the Oval Office are those of a ``sex addict.''
</P>
<P>
   Other psychotherapists caution that understanding the mental
underpinnings of human behavior _ or even learning exactly what
happened _ usually takes hours of one-on-one exchange between
patient and therapist.
</P>
<P>
   And the American Psychiatric Association, in its mammoth
compendium of diagnosable mental disorders, ``Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual,'' does not even recognize ``sexual addiction''
as a mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   To those therapists who believe there is such a mental disorder,
sexual addition refers to repeated, constant and compulsive sexual
activity. ``Weird'' sex does not appear to be a necessary element
in any of the definitions.
</P>
<P>
   Those who believe Clinton is slavishly addicted to sex are
finding willing outlets for their views.
</P>
<P>
   From the rumor-relaying Drudge Report on the Internet to tabloid
newspapers and respected dailies to well-known book publishers,
media outlets are providing sex experts and other therapists space
to psychoanalyze Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   They are saying he did whatever he did because:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  His mother was a gambler and a very intelligent woman.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  His stepfather was abusive.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  He never knew his biological father.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  He has developed a lifelong habit of pushing the envelope of
disapproval to the limit, then escaping punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Psychodynamics are at play: The president compartmentalizes. The
president needs approval in the face of misconduct, a sort of
I-love-you-despite-anything-you-do reassurance.
</P>
<P>
   Sexual addiction ``is the only thing that really makes sense,''
said Stanley Renshon, a professor of political science at City
University of New York and a psychoanalyst. ``If you look at his
biography, he has all of the predisposing factors. Genetically,
there was a great deal of addiction on both sides of his family.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Renshon believes, Clinton's abusive stepfather
caused the future president to ``yearn for a father'' and to
develop problems with self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs continual reassurance that he's lovable and loved,''
Renshon said in a telephone interview during a pause in his tour to
promote his book, ``The Clinton Syndrome: The President and the
Self-destructive Nature of Sexual Addiction'' (Prima Publishing).
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, he said, sex becomes a way of ``avoiding very
painful feelings of shame, guilt, rage.''
</P>
<P>
   Renshon acknowledged that he does not know how many times
Clinton has had sex in the past 10 or 20 years or with whom. The
total number of alleged encounters, proven, acknowledged or
otherwise, would amount to far fewer than constant, repetitive,
``sex addict'' behavior would suggest, he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's true. The fact that someone has an affair does not make
them a sex addict,'' he said. But ``the total disregard of
consequences, the willingness to ignore (Independent Prosecutor)
Kenneth Starr and the press, are further manifestations.''
</P>
<P>
   Renshon also suggested that grief over the assassination of
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel, who he said was a ``father
figure'' to Clinton, may have combined with other political
pressures to make the president lose control of himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (the sexual addiction diagnosis) is obviously not the
only way to understand what happened, but it's one way, and I think
it is a reasonable way,'' Renshon said. ``I had my doubts working
on the book. There's an enormous responsibility in making a public
statement of this sort. As events unfolded, I don't lack confidence
in my diagnosis now.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lonnie Barbach, a Mill Valley, Calif., psychologist who
specializes in treating sexual problems, does not buy the ``sex
addict'' concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``An addiction is something where you are physiologically forced
to continue,'' she said. ``In terms of sexuality, I don't think
that exists.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that ``there may be things that you get out of sex to
create this feeling that you can't make it if you're not sexual,
but that's not addiction.''
</P>
<P>
   In terms of Clinton, she noted, ``we don't know what happened.
If we knew what happened, we don't know how many times it happened
or under what circumstances. We don't know what his relationship
with his wife is. We just don't have the data, and without the
data, I don't see how you can jump to any conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbach, author of ``Going the Distance: Finding and Keeping
Lifelong Love,'' said she would have to ``have a number of sessions
with a patient before I could even find out what's going on, much
less being able to understand why it's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   David Marcotte, a Fayetteville, N.C., psychiatrist and spokesman
for the American Psychiatric Association on the subject of ``sexual
addiction,'' said that even if evidence eventually shows that the
president is the victim of a compulsive or obsessive disorder with
regard to sex, that is not the same as an addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Jed Diamond, a Willits, Calif., clinical social worker, goes a
step further than labeling Clinton a sex addict. In his view, the
president is a sex addict who is experiencing male menopause.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond, author of ``Male Menopause,'' (Sourcebooks), defined
that as a time when ``hormonally and physiologically men are sort
of going through puberty in reverse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Men who are going through these hormonal changes need to pay
attention to them, President Clinton included,'' Diamond said. He
acknowledged that he had no specific knowledge of Clinton's current
hormonal status and does not know how many sexual liaisons the
president has had in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're speculating here,'' he said, ``but I would
say from 35 years of clinical practice, I am seeing the tip of a
familiar iceberg.''

 &HT;    ANALYSTS DISAGREE OVER CLINTON 'SEX ADDICT' DIAGNOSIS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (l) lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even before details of President Clinton's
extramarital sexual activity were made public, some mental health
professionals have concluded that the cravings that supposedly
steamed up the Oval Office are those of a ``sex addict.''
</P>
<P>
   Other psychotherapists caution that understanding the mental
underpinnings of human behavior _ or even learning exactly what
happened _ usually takes hours of one-on-one exchange between
patient and therapist.
</P>
<P>
   And the American Psychiatric Association, in its mammoth
compendium of diagnosable mental disorders, ``Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual,'' does not even recognize ``sexual addiction''
as a mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   To those therapists who believe there is such a mental disorder,
sexual addition refers to repeated, constant and compulsive sexual
activity. ``Weird'' sex does not appear to be a necessary element
in any of the definitions.
</P>
<P>
   Those who believe Clinton is slavishly addicted to sex are
finding willing outlets for their views.
</P>
<P>
   From the rumor-relaying Drudge Report on the Internet to tabloid
newspapers and respected dailies to well-known book publishers,
media outlets are providing sex experts and other therapists space
to psychoanalyze Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   They are saying he did whatever he did because:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  His mother was a gambler and a very intelligent woman.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  His stepfather was abusive.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  He never knew his biological father.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  He has developed a lifelong habit of pushing the envelope of
disapproval to the limit, then escaping punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Psychodynamics are at play: The president compartmentalizes. The
president needs approval in the face of misconduct, a sort of
I-love-you-despite-anything-you-do reassurance.
</P>
<P>
   Sexual addiction ``is the only thing that really makes sense,''
said Stanley Renshon, a professor of political science at City
University of New York and a psychoanalyst. ``If you look at his
biography, he has all of the predisposing factors. Genetically,
there was a great deal of addiction on both sides of his family.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Renshon believes, Clinton's abusive stepfather
caused the future president to ``yearn for a father'' and to
develop problems with self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs continual reassurance that he's lovable and loved,''
Renshon said in a telephone interview during a pause in his tour to
promote his book, ``The Clinton Syndrome: The President and the
Self-destructive Nature of Sexual Addiction'' (Prima Publishing).
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, he said, sex becomes a way of ``avoiding very
painful feelings of shame, guilt, rage.''
</P>
<P>
   Renshon acknowledged that he does not know how many times
Clinton has had sex in the past 10 or 20 years or with whom. The
total number of alleged encounters, proven, acknowledged or
otherwise, would amount to far fewer than constant, repetitive,
``sex addict'' behavior would suggest, he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's true. The fact that someone has an affair does not make
them a sex addict,'' he said. But ``the total disregard of
consequences, the willingness to ignore (Independent Prosecutor)
Kenneth Starr and the press, are further manifestations.''
</P>
<P>
   Renshon also suggested that grief over the assassination of
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel, who he said was a ``father
figure'' to Clinton, may have combined with other political
pressures to make the president lose control of himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (the sexual addiction diagnosis) is obviously not the
only way to understand what happened, but it's one way, and I think
it is a reasonable way,'' Renshon said. ``I had my doubts working
on the book. There's an enormous responsibility in making a public
statement of this sort. As events unfolded, I don't lack confidence
in my diagnosis now.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lonnie Barbach, a Mill Valley, Calif., psychologist who
specializes in treating sexual problems, does not buy the ``sex
addict'' concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``An addiction is something where you are physiologically forced
to continue,'' she said. ``In terms of sexuality, I don't think
that exists.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that ``there may be things that you get out of sex to
create this feeling that you can't make it if you're not sexual,
but that's not addiction.''
</P>
<P>
   In terms of Clinton, she noted, ``we don't know what happened.
If we knew what happened, we don't know how many times it happened
or under what circumstances. We don't know what his relationship
with his wife is. We just don't have the data, and without the
data, I don't see how you can jump to any conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbach, author of ``Going the Distance: Finding and Keeping
Lifelong Love,'' said she would have to ``have a number of sessions
with a patient before I could even find out what's going on, much
less being able to understand why it's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   David Marcotte, a Fayetteville, N.C., psychiatrist and spokesman
for the American Psychiatric Association on the subject of ``sexual
addiction,'' said that even if evidence eventually shows that the
president is the victim of a compulsive or obsessive disorder with
regard to sex, that is not the same as an addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Jed Diamond, a Willits, Calif., clinical social worker, goes a
step further than labeling Clinton a sex addict. In his view, the
president is a sex addict who is experiencing male menopause.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond, author of ``Male Menopause,'' (Sourcebooks), defined
that as a time when ``hormonally and physiologically men are sort
of going through puberty in reverse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Men who are going through these hormonal changes need to pay
attention to them, President Clinton included,'' Diamond said. He
acknowledged that he had no specific knowledge of Clinton's current
hormonal status and does not know how many sexual liaisons the
president has had in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're speculating here,'' he said, ``but I would
say from 35 years of clinical practice, I am seeing the tip of a
familiar iceberg.''

   GLASS-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON When the Iraqis pulled the plug on
U.N. weapons inspections in January, President Clinton threatened a
missile shower unless Saddam Hussein backed down. When the Iraqis

   YOUNG-COLUMN _ Once upon a time, like viewing a damsel in
sackcloth, we were left only to imagine what people like Jerry
Falwell, Pat Robertson and other agents of Piety Inc. wanted when
they asked American voters for the keys to the family car. Now we
don't have to imagine. With Kenneth Starr as Elliot Ness and Bill

   KELSO-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ You've got to wonder how Babe
Ruth would react to all of this home-run hype we've been putting up

   MINTER-COLUMN _ Phillip Wiseman came home with a question. ``Why

year, earlier in the century or in previous centuries. (Kleinberg,
Cox News Service) MOVED 9/10.
</P>
<P>
   MSKUBE-COLUMN _ It's a truism that we never see ourselves the
way others see us. The lenses of self-interest and prejudice always
obstruct more light than they admit, and sometimes they are little
more than mirrors of what we wish to believe. Nowhere is this more
true than in the endless, and endlessly tiring, debates about the

 &HT;    Putting the question to old timers
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Phillip Wiseman, our Fayetteville neighbor and John Deere
tractor enthusiast, has a day job in Atlanta supervising the
printing of the newspaper you are now reading. After attending a
100th anniversary celebration of the founding of the Cox
communications empire, he came home with a question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did they give sunrise and sunset in Central Standard Time
in 1939?'' he asked. As part of the anniversary celebration the
newspaper reprinted souvenir front pages from Dec. 13, 1939,
announcing the Journal's sale to Gov. James M. Cox, of Ohio.
Phillip's pressman's eye was quick to catch the small type in the
weather box: Sun rises 6:36 a.m.; sets 4:30 p.m.; Moon rises 9:13
a.m.; sets 8:30 p.m. Central Standard Time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are you asking me?'' I asked Phillip. ``Why didn't you ask
somebody at the newspaper?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because you're the only person I know old enough to remember
1939,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't bother to explain that I wasn't exactly a seasoned
editor keeping track of newspaper front pages in 1939. Anybody over
60 in today's world is prehistoric. Actually, I'm flattered when
young folks seek my advice and counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago a young sports reporter came with his
pencil and pad to collect my personal memories of the University of
Georgia's 1929 game with Yale dedicating Sanford Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry,'' I apologized to the young man. ``I missed that
one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised,'' he said. ``I thought you'd have been certain
to attend a big event like that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' I said, ``after walking all the way from Appomattox
back to Fayette County on my bare feet I just didn't feel like
making another long trip.'' I thought my response was kinder than
pointing out that I wasn't quite born in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   I was trying to think of an answer for Phillip when Wilson
Phelps walked up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you can help us,'' I said to Wilson. ``Phillip wants to
know why The Atlanta Journal gave sunrise and sunset in Central
Standard Time in 1939.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson seemed a little put off. ``How would I know?'' he asked.
``I was only 2 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   As we talked, I began to have vague memories about Georgia being
in two different time zones before World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you can do a little research,'' Phillip suggested. I
told him I'd check with Frank Reeves and my uncle Donald.
</P>
<P>
   Uncle Donald said he never paid much attention to time changes.
``We just rang the bell at 12 o'clock for dinner and at 1 o'clock
for going back to the field,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Uncle Donald didn't do much to solve the time puzzle, I
threw in a piggyback question, like professional pollsters do.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about the governor's race?'' I asked. Whenever I'm in
doubt about how a political race is going to come out, I drop in on
Uncle Donald. He's been batting about .900 for as long as I can
remember.
</P>
<P>
   Being as he's shy about publicity, I can't tell you who is going
to be Georgia's next governor. However, I will suggest that
everybody be real nice to Roy Barnes between now and November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember when the whole state got on Eastern time,''
Frank admitted when I called on him. ``Go see Bud, I don't think
Mr. Cliff ever changed his bell.''
</P>
<P>
   Bud Ballard is clerk of the court, our lone Democrat among
elected officials. When Fayette County got rich and people started
voting a straight Republican ticket, everybody else switched. Bud
said he'd keep on dancing with them that brung him, and after 29
years in office, he still is.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Cliff, his farmer father, wasn't quick to change either. Bud
said Frank was right. Mr. Cliff ignored decrees from Washington and
kept on ringing his bell at the same time. He was on ``Sun Time.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're on Sun Time you don't need a bell to tell you when to
unhitch your mule from the plow and head for the house at high
noon. When you can put your right foot smack in the middle of the
shadow of your head, it's 12 o'clock Sun Time wherever you happen
to be. Bells were more for ambience.
</P>
<P>
   Bud couldn't remember exactly when we got off Sun Time and on
Same Time. He got out his U.S. Code Annotated. We discovered that
over the years Congress has spent more time messing with time than
it has with health care. Daylight Saving Time was tried in 1918,
unsuccessfully.
</P>
<P>
   The line that divided the state into EST and CST, running
between Gwinnett and DeKalb counties and on into southeast Georgia
disappeared in 1941 when Central Time moved to the Alabama line.
</P>
<P>
   Congress created ``War Time'' in 1942, theoretically giving us
an extra hour to work on defeating Germany and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   After my diligent research in an attempt to answer Phillip's
question, an undercover operative who sometimes sneaks me
information off the newspapers' computers discovered two previously
published articles on the subject, one by columnist Elliott Brack,
the other by science writer Charles Seabrook. They traced the
history of time zones, and how the railroads and then the
government decided they knew more about high noon than Mr. Cliff
Ballard's bell.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, I'd merge their research with a dash of my own and
answer Phillip's question without going to a lot of trouble, except
that I read where newspapers have started firing columnists when
they borrow from friends and neighbors. Times change, and not only
in the zones.

 &HT;    Impeachment medicine
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ For the good of the republic, President Clinton
needs to be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders, newspapers editorial boards and pundits
should stop asking Clinton to resign. A Band-Aid resignation would
not treat Clinton's destructive contamination of America's
political process.
</P>
<P>
   Congress needs to take the advice of respected Democratic
statesman Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and begin impeachment
proceedings against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan said Congress should launch the impeachment process
even before independent counsel Kenneth Starr turned over his
report containing ``substantial and credible information'' of
impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The nation needs a full, fair and public impeachment because
half of America's adult population still suffers under the
mesmerizing thrall of a manipulating scoundrel.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear from the public opinion polls that form Clinton's
moveable policy positions that 50 percent of Americans still
support Clinton. These loyal Americans certainly do not believe
they have been suckered by a scoundrel. It's for for these
Americans that Congress must impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A quick Clinton resignation means the man who dragged the nation
through his own muck for seven years could become rich on the talk
circuit by playing the victim of a vast right-wing conspiracy
obsessed with sex.
</P>
<P>
   A public impeachment should finally convince gulled Americans
that sex was never considered as an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Clinton is immoral or that he lies pathologically
to the public also had nothing to do with the independent counsel's
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment is necessary because bewitched Clinton supporters
need to realize that the investigation was about crimes and that no
responsible citizen can absolve criminal conduct.
</P>
<P>
   This is a nation of laws. No citizen is above the law. These
principles form the backbone of our democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Lying repeatedly to the American people is disgraceful. It is
immoral. But it is not criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Lying under oath is criminal. Scoundrels lie to the American
people. Criminals lie under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses tampering is criminal. Obstructing justice is
criminal. Subornation of perjury is criminal. People who commit
these acts are criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Every crime requires a punishment. Without punishment, laws are
meaningless. Americans cannot pick and choose laws to follow.
</P>
<P>
   There was credible evidence that Clinton may have committed
crimes when the Whitewater independent counsel was recommended by
Attorney General Janet Reno and approved by a federal three-judge
panel.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that Clinton and his cronies blocked, delayed
and dare we say obstructed the investigation every step of the way,
Starr's report now is in the hands of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The trigger has been pulled. It can't be unpulled.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will still play to the public and the polls. He will
continue to claim that the investigation was only about his private
sex life. But it's too late to pull that trick on Congress.
</P>
<P>
   It's the duty of the House to handle the articles of
impeachment. It's the Senate's duty to hold the impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate could find the president not guilty of the charges.
Clinton also could be censured for soiling the presidency and
trashing the nations values.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton isn't thrown out of office this time, it's likely
that he will be back before Congress facing impeachable charges
that he led a criminal subversion of U.S. election and campaign
finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton should not resign. He should be impeached.

 &HT;    College teaches parents sacrificial love
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many parents of college freshmen across the nation are adjusting
to life with one less child at home. We are among them.
</P>
<P>
   Driving away from our son's dorm room that first day was a
poignant moment. There he stood, taller than either of us,
confident and expectant, surrounded by new linens, towels,
textbooks, laundry hampers and bulletin boards. His life was
expanding, and suddenly ours seemed to be contracting.
</P>
<P>
   I thought back to my own first days at college. My freshman
year, I attended a small state college three hours from home. We
packed up our pickup truck and my Mustang and moved all my worldly
possessions into a dorm suite, one I shared with five other girls.
Nothing looks so barren as the cement block walls of a dorm.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there was nothing left to unpack or put away or
rearrange and it was time for my parents to leave. I am the
youngest of their children and was the last to leave home. We
hugged each other a long time as we said goodbye. But the moment
came, and they got into their car and drove away, leaving me waving
to them from the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   I never felt so alone in my whole life.
</P>
<P>
   You adjust, though. I set about getting to know my suitemates
and rearranging my new little world. I settled in.
</P>
<P>
   Just a short week later, it was my birthday. That day, walking
back from class in the late afternoon, my step was slow and my
heart heavy. I had already checked the dorm mailbox and opened my
birthday cards. Now, I had nothing to look forward to.
</P>
<P>
   My folks were farmers and September was harvest time. Dad was in
the fields before sunup until after dark combining soybeans. There
would be no time to make the six-hour round trip to visit me. I
understood, but there's something extremely grim about the first
birthday you don't spend with your family.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the dorm lobby, I walked gloomily around the corner
toward the elevators, never lifting my head. Suddenly I heard a
familiar voice say, ``Hey, dreamboat.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Dad, sitting with Mom on the lobby couch waiting for me.
Gathered around them were all my suitemates, who had been in on the
secret since the day we moved in. I had never been so happy to see
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   My folks took us all to a nice restaurant. The waiter brought a
cake and sang happy birthday to me. I felt like a princess. We
laughed, shared family stories and had a glorious time.
</P>
<P>
   We came back to the dorm and my parents prepared to leave. Again
we hugged, but this time I wasn't sad. They had given me an
inestimable gift just by being there. I knew the next morning, Dad
would be up before dawn for another long day in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, I am still amazed at the effort it took for him to
make that visit. It went against everything he'd ever been taught _
to leave a harvest field early on a sunny, clear day. The pace
during harvest is relentless, and it was just understood that you
worked until the last row was picked, the last load delivered to
the granary. Then, you rested _ not before.
</P>
<P>
   I'll never forget how my world was transformed in that lonely
dorm on my 18th birthday the moment I heard him say, ``Hey,
dreamboat.''
</P>
<P>
   Who can begin to comprehend a parent's love? It's unreasonable,
inexplicable, sacrificial. This day, it's the lump in my throat as
I look out the back windshield and see our son, waving to us from
the sidewalk in front of his college dorm.

 &HT;    A triple threat: Usher sees himself as singer, actor, dancer
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Usher would like to get his groove back.
</P>
<P>
   ``For my true definition of relaxing, you might want to send me
a ticket to Jamaica,'' says the 19-year-old R&AMP;B star-of-the-moment,
speaking by phone before a tour date in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that he's lost his musical groove. Anyone who has
followed the rocket-ship success of his current platinum album, My
Way, knows the smooth-voiced singer is on top of his game. And he's
certainly taking advantage of other opportunities, starring in
films and TV series and planning his own line of U Wear clothes.
</P>
<P>
   But when you're just a year out of high school and the whole
world wants a piece of you _ literally, in the case of some of his
more ardent female fans _ you might feel a little, um, pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got a heck of an upkeep,'' says Usher _ real name Raymond
Usher IV _ of his daily grind.
</P>
<P>
   What's perhaps most remarkable about Usher's story is that ``My
Way'' is actually his sophomore effort, a concerted attempt to
reestablish and reposition himself after his disappointing
self-titled debut album in 1994. That recording, co-produced by
urban impresario Sean ``Puffy'' Combs, yielded one Top 10 hit
(``Think Of You''), but failed to generate the Michael Jackson-like
excitement that had been predicted for the young star. Some critics
also complained that the album was too sexually charged for a teen
artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Way,'' which carries a parental advisory warning, is no
less explicit, but it's clear that Usher has grown into the role of
mature singer-songwriter (he helped compose several of the album's
10 cuts). With its slick blend of mellow vocals, razor-sharp
rapping and hip-hop rhythms _ contributing artists include Lil'
Kim, Shanice Wilson and Monica _ it's simply a better musical
effort.
</P>
<P>
   The album's title is not by accident: After letting others guide
his debut, Usher was determined to have more of a say in ``My
Way.'' And although it was co-produced by such industry giants as
Kenny ``Babyface'' Edmonds, Antonio ``L.A.'' Reid and Jermaine
Dupri, Usher played a key role in the process. ``I analyzed
everything before I did it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   That behind-the-scenes involvement has extended to his videos
and concert performances. His goal is to make audiences aware of
his skills as singer, actor and dancer. ``What's that make you? A
triple threat,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Usher is also getting recognition for his dramatic talent apart
from his music-making. He has appeared in a variety of television
projects, from a recurring role in the soap opera ``The Bold and
the Beautiful'' to a part as Brandy's boyfriend on the series
``Moesha.'' Next up is his first major film role _ in the sci-fi
thriller ``The Faculty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a football player,'' he says of the part. ``I try to make
him as cool as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Usher adds that making the transition from singing to acting is
not that difficult. ``Singing is an acting role in itself. You have
to project an image,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   And Usher insists that much of what you see on stage is just
that _ an image. Yes, he likes to take off his shirt in concert and
gave fans an extended view of his lean upper torso. ``I think after
they (his record company) saw that I had pectoral muscles, they
said we could use that to our advantage,'' he notes. But he's no
macho man: ``I'm really kind and gentle,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   A Tennessee native, Usher moved with his family to Atlanta when
he was 12 _ and his musical talent was soon noticed in the church
choir and beyond. He did the talent-show circuit and was spotted
along the way by representatives from LaFace Records. An audition
led to his first album.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout it all, he credits his mother, who doubles as his
business manager, with providing him the foundation for success.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's my best friend, she loves me to death,'' he says. ``I
don't care what it is, she's involved. Even if I'm getting married,
she's going to be involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of which, Usher has been linked romantically with many
female stars, including his TV partner Brandy. But he says that's
just Hollywood gossip: He's too young to get involved in a serious
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   And if he did get involved, it wouldn't be with an actress:
They're too good at playing make-believe. ``You never know when the
person is being truthful,'' he says.

 &HT;    ``Mr. Big'' is the man that the sex police wanted
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once upon a time, like viewing a damsel in sackcloth, we were
left only to imagine what people like Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson
and other agents of Piety Inc. wanted when they asked American
voters for the keys to the family car.
</P>
<P>
   Now we don't have to imagine. With Kenneth Starr as Elliot Ness
and Bill Clinton as Al Capone, the sex police have their man, Mr.
Big, and a whole new law enforcement industry.
</P>
<P>
   A national dragnet? Well, it's not that everyone with a violin
case can expect a shakedown, but people with a ``past'' _ we know
there are only a handful, people like Dan ``Little Scumbag'' Burton
_ can face days of reckoning, or so it would seem.
</P>
<P>
   I wish we could blame Robertson or Falwell for this. Actually,
it's Clinton's fault. With acts of stupidity and recklessness, he's
delivered to the pompous right the issue it long has seen as divine
mandate: the chance to treat sex as a crime.
</P>
<P>
   We've seen this mindset in the so-called anti-abortion movement.
If these crusaders truly were intent on fewer abortions, they'd do
all they could to make sure that people didn't conceive when having
sex. But they seek to undermine family planning services at every
step, leading one to assume that they aren't anti-abortion or
anti-conception. They are just anti-sex.
</P>
<P>
   Now this new law-and-order crowd finds itself raging against the
masses that continue to give Bill Clinton good job ratings and,
though disgusted and disappointed, continue to be squishy-soft on
sex as an impeachable offense. (Clinton has that
impeachable-sounding cover-up thing hanging over him. But to the
masses, covering up comes with the package when stupid and reckless
things are involved. Right, Congressman Burton?)
</P>
<P>
   What's with the infernal ambivalence? We shouldn't be surprised.
What's going on here is what goes on every election when so-called
conservatives ask voters to make government an agent of intrusion
into matters personal.
</P>
<P>
   I say so-called conservatives because a lot of conservatives
don't think a government fixated on private matters is a
conservative government.
</P>
<P>
   In a fascinating commentary this week, the libertarian Ayn Rand
Institute said that the Monica Lewinsky scandal indeed is an
example of moral bankruptcy _ by the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Commentator Robert Tracinski said the personal attack waged
against Clinton allows the Republicans to evade fundamental issues
about governance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Few Republicans genuinely care whether Clinton seduced an
intern,'' wrote Tracinski. ``But they are thrilled at the
opportunity to defeat Clinton without having to stick their necks
out by taking a resolute stand on ideological issues.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tracinski's view, the Republicans are trying to hide their
closeted love for big government and their inner distaste for
blowing up the welfare state.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of Americans, though they may not share the Ayn Rand
Institute's anti-government ideology, would share the opinion that
what we have here is a costly distraction. And they feel the same
generally about the so-called moral agenda of the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   This even applies to the Republicans' core constituency.
Recently the Republican Leadership Council polled registered
Republicans in key House districts and found them ill at ease with
what the religious right wants to do.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, 61 percent said they'd oppose ``excluding
homosexuals from leadership positions'' in the party simply because
those people were gay.
</P>
<P>
   What? We can't pry into their sex lives either? Just what do we
do with our time?

   MONICA-FLU _ The public's disgust with President Clinton's

people need a hard pillow, others want a soft one, so it's good to
have both on hand'' adds Pararo, who owns the The Gaslight Inn in

<P>
   That's a sure ticket to the Martin County jail on child abuse
charges, as a 39-year-old Stuart, Florida woman found out recently.
</P>
<P>
   Because the children are minors, all names are being withheld by
police.
</P>
<P>
   It all started when the 11-year-old found more than he was
looking for in his mother and stepfather's bedroom. Routing through
the linen closet for birthday presents, the boy found a bag of
marijuana, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Following the instructions of his anti-drug DARE class, the boy
then called the sheriff's office.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing with the deputies, mother and son argued about
his decision. When his mother continued to yell at her son after he
locked himself in his bedroom, the 5-year-old told her mother to
leave her brother alone because he had done the right thing, police
reports said.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the woman grabbed her daughter by the neck, threw
her to the ground and slammed her head against a door twice,
according to deputies' reports. The girl then broke free and ran
outside.
</P>
<P>
   Dizzy from the blows, the girl stumbled around the neighborhood
before going to a friend's house where she called her father and
deputies.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's father took her to Martin Memorial Hospital South.
The father told police his daughter had cuts and a sprained neck.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother spent the next day in jail, but was released on
$2,500 bond.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The peregrine falcon may be removed from the endangered species
list.
</P>
<P>
   The population of peregrines in the United States and Canada has
jumped to 1,593 nesting pairs from an all-time low of 324 pairs in
1975, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 25 years, the people of the United States have rescued this
awesome raptor from the brink of extinction,'' Interior Secretary
Bruce Babbitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the peregrine is removed from the endangered species
list as planned, it will continue to be protected by the Migratory
Bird Treaty Act, which prohibits the taking, killing, possession or
transportation of migratory birds, their eggs or their nests.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators are taking public comments on the peregrine
de-listing plan. To comment, write: Field Supervisor, U.S. Fish and

 &HT;    Who's the man behind the rubber chicken?
 &HT;    Photos available
 &HT;    By Ron Wiggins
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRADENTON, Fla. _ When a reader tipped me off that the Johnson
Smith Co. catalog is alive and sassy in Bradenton, I shot from my
chair like the victim of one of the novelty company's infamous
Whoopee Cushions.
</P>
<P>
   As a kid, I pored over its comic-book ads for joy buzzers, faux
vomit and books promising to reveal the secrets of jiujitsu or
kissing or finding lost treasure.
</P>
<P>
   But the ad that is forever etched in my memory featured the
cartoon of a smiling man carrying a steamer trunk. ``Let me out of
here!'' a voice from the trunk cried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys! Boys! Boys!'' the headline shouted. ``Throw your voice
into a trunk, under the table . . . into a desk at school or
anywhere.'' For 35 cents you got a ``Ventrillo'' reed that, when
placed under the tongue, was supposed to make such feats possible.
An instruction book was included.
</P>
<P>
   My dad, ever the skeptic, told me not to squander my 35 cents
``on that hooey.''
</P>
<P>
   Hooey? Hardly, according to Sam Varco, 66, the Ocean Ridge,
Fla., reader who grew up with a Johnson Smith catalog tucked under
his mattress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Johnson Smith Co. is right up there with Daisy air rifles,
Lionel Trains and Lincoln Logs,'' Varco wrote. ``How about getting
their newest catalog and spreading the good news?''
</P>
<P>
   I did better than that. I journeyed even unto the mail-order
Mecca of all that is weird and wacky, the Johnson Smith Co.
headquarters on our state's west coast, and met 62-year-old Paul
Hoenle, president of the novelties and gadgets company established
in 1914 by Alfred Johnson Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, an Australian, sold a similar business in Sydney and set
up shop in Chicago, hoping to tap the vast North American market
with its tens of millions of rural males just aching for some gag
or gadget or naughtiness to wow the boys over a cracker-barrel.
</P>
<P>
   His 96-page catalog quickly exploded to 576 pages of beguiling
illustrations and zippy prose that read like a carnival barker's
patter. ``Mystery of love-making solved,'' began an ad for a
pamphlet that for 10 cents promised to share the secret.
</P>
<P>
   But if your problem in the romance department was a fickle lady
love, Johnson Smith had you covered, too: ``If you fear your best
girl is flirting with the other fellow, place the Seebackroscope to
your eye and catch her in the act.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Sears &AMP; Roebuck may have ruled the outhouse, but it was
Johnson Smith's catalog that was hidden in every corn crib between
Keokuk and Kokomo. (Mothers didn't always approve.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We have fourth- and fifth-generation customers, some going
back as far as 1914,'' said Hoenle, a Canadian marketing graduate
who joined the Johnson Smith Co. in 1966. ``Our client list has
included Winston Churchill, John F. Kennedy and Johnny Carson.
Carson used to do two shows a year on gadgets from our catalog.''
</P>
<P>
   When Smith started his business, Hoenle explained, ``there was
nothing like it in America.''
</P>
<P>
   But novelties are hardly novel anymore. ``By 1966, there were
400 mail-order companies,'' he said. ``Now, there are over
10,000.''
</P>
<P>
   To survive in an ocean of mail-order competition and yet remain
true to the founder's insistence that the catalog be a fun read,
Johnson Smith now offers its catalogs in two flavors: Things You
Never Knew Existed, aimed at men, and The Lighter Side, unusual
gifts pitched to female gift-buyers. The catalogs are updated 14
times a year with 25 million mailings worldwide in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   For the Things You Never Knew Existed (TYNKE) catalog, Hoenle
and his buyers comb the world with one goal in mind: ``We want our
customers to say, `Aha, I didn't know about that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A slightly different reaction is sought for shoppers who browse
The Lighter Side. ``We want our female customers to say, `I will be
remembered for giving this gift,' '' Hoenle explained.
</P>
<P>
   As for former comic book readers who still look to Johnson Smith
for their rubber chicken needs, the company will always be there
for them, Hoenle promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel a great deal of loyalty to our customers, so we still
carry many of our old gag merchandise. Twice a year, we offer
package deals where they can buy five jokes for 99 cents each or 10
for 99 cents.''
</P>
<P>
   And here Hoenle directed me to a page of ads, the illustrations
and text unchanged since I first read them 40 or 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Disappearing Ink: ``It looks like any blue mess . . . Gone in 5
minutes, yet causes 5 minutes of howls. Great gag _ sure fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Itching Powder: ``The more they scratch, the more they itch.
Ever wonder what a billion mosquito bites would feel like? Just a
little bit on the skin &AMP; the torture starts.''
</P>
<P>
   Imitation Vomit: ``The `gloppiest' look. Place by baby, dog,
dinner table or pretend you've been sick.''
</P>
<P>
   1001 Snappy Jokes: ``Leave 'em laughing wherever you go. Build
your reputation as a real `funny man.' Always have a zingy
one-liner ready to get things going or polish of smart alecks.''
</P>
<P>
   And there, near the top of the layout of reprised favorites, was
the original Whoopee Cushion ad, complete with the crude drawing of
the embarrassed woman sitting down as the cushion beneath her sighs
with a lady-like ``Poo.'' (Poo? The ad writer acknowledges his
limitations: ``When the victim unsuspectingly sits upon the
cushion, it gives forth noises better imagined than described.'')
</P>
<P>
   And how many of the Bronx cheer bladders does Johnson Smith sell
every year?
</P>
<P>
   ``About 2,000. We carry them as a salute to the past,'' Hoenle
said, turning now to an ad for a state-of-the-art electronic
flatulator. ``You would do much better with our electronic Whoopee
Cushion.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the company does better with the $14.97 electronic
noisemaker. The ad copy is rhapsodic: ``The WIRELESS Remote Control
Fart Machine is easily concealed . . . virtually anywhere. Just
push the transmitter button from up to 100 feet to deliver the most
embarrassingly realistic sound flatulence can produce.''
</P>
<P>
   I told Hoenle, in all honesty, that I had trouble understanding
why anyone would pay real money for high-tech gastrointestinal
noises.
</P>
<P>
   And here, Hoenle explained that America's love of the low brow
and high tech has merged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, something like itching powder or stink bombs is not
always funny to some. But our Whoopee Cushion has been around for
many years, and now with remote control, you have so many more
options.''
</P>
<P>
   I blinked stupidly. Hoenle, despairing at my lack of
imagination, pressed on. ``Just think,'' he said, his eyes
crinkling with merriment. ``You can put the device under your
editor's chair and press a button, and nobody knows you did it. Or
you can buy our model with the time delay.''
</P>
<P>
   I said that I was sorry, but I was much more likely to buy
Johnson Smith's carbide salute cannon for $119 or their nifty
horizontal steam engine for $114, or even the $59 die-cast 1948
American Indian motorcycle before I would spend $14 to make
electronic Whoopee.
</P>
<P>
   Hoenle studied me doubtfully, then asked a personal question.
Had I, as a youngster, ordered anything from a Johnson Smith Co.
comic book ad?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted the Ventrillo reed,'' I admitted. ``But my dad said
it was hooey.''
</P>
<P>
   And here, Hoenle placed a gentle hand on my shoulder and told me
that the 35 cents would have bought me much more than a tin reed
for playing voice tricks. It would have brought to my mailbox the
marvels of the Johnson Smith Co. catalog, twice a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am afraid,'' Hoenle said disconsolately, ``that your father
did you a disservice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows? You might have become a great ventriloquist. Edgar
Bergen bought his first dummy from us. Some people are so factual,
they leave no room for possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   My dad loved gadgetry and jokes, I protested. He just looked at
the ad and thought it was hooey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your father is still living, is he? I'm going to give him our
Mystery Electronic Top that spins for days. But I want you to
remove the printed explanation of how it works. It will drive him
crazy. Our little joke on your father, eh?''
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, last weekend was my dad's birthday, and when I
left my parents' home, the Electronic Mystery Top was still
spinning on its plastic base. And my dad, an electrical engineer,
still had not unlocked its secret.

</P>
<P>
   THE JOHNSON SMITH CO.
</P>
<P>
   1914: Alfred Johnson Smith moves to Chicago to start a catalog
novelties business modeled after the business he sold in Australia.
His first catalog, ``Surprising Novelties, Puzzles, Tricks, Joke
Goods, Useful Articles, Etc.'' is self-described as ``The only
concern of its kind in America.'' 1922: The 96-page catalog has
grown to 400 pages and employs 150 people. 1923 to 1935: The
catalog is up to 576 pages and distributed to 100,000 to 200,000
customers a year. The 1930 catalog, with 728 pages, some in color,
almost sinks the company. The 576-page format is restored through
World War II. Catalogs are free to customers, a dime for
noncustomers. 1935 to 1945: Smith moves his business to Detroit,
hoping for closer ties to Canada, and brings sons Arthur and Paul
into the company. When Smith notes the popularity of comic books,
he is quick to recognize a ready market for tricks and novelties.
Business booms until the war years. By 1941, shortages of
merchandise, labor and paper reduce the business to a shell. 1946
to 1970: The 576-page catalog is resumed through the 1940s until
escalating paper and mailing costs dictates a condensed 96-page
catalog featuring 2,800 of the company's best selling items. Up to
500,000 catalogs printed a year. 1971 to 1985: Expansion takes the
company to new digs in Mount Clemens, Mich. Credit cards and phone
orders are now accepted. The first Things You Never Knew Existed
catalog is published and in 1984, the spin-off, The Lighter Side,
aimed at women, is started. Hot-selling items include Star Trek
Phasers, a Mystery Top that spins for days without apparent help, a
candle-powered bathtub steamboat, and the company's best seller:
The Midget Bible. 1986: The company moves to a 54,000-square-foot
automated facility in Bradenton where labor costs are low. Two
hundred people are employed seasonally and 25 million catalogs are
mailed worldwide each year. ``We remain,'' says company president
Paul Hoenle, ``the only concern of its kind in America.''

 &HT;    Agreement reached, but ``really hurts''
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner and Brandon Peterson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Workers at a General Motors Corp. parts plant in Kettering
approved a landmark agreement that will keep the plant open for the
next four years and spare at least 2,500 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement ends a three-year struggle by the workers to
secure their future with the world's largest automaker.
</P>
<P>
   But that job security comes at a steep price. There's no
assurance that 400 retiring workers will be replaced, and new and
young workers will see big cuts in wages, health benefits and
profit-sharing plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Kettering workers voted 1,499 to 322 in favor of the
agreement. Many of the workers said they weren't happy with the
deal, but felt they had to accept it or watch GM carry through on
plans to sell or close the plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The agreement) really hurts the young guys, but what else
could we do,'' said Charlie Pierce, a long-time worker at the
Forrer Boulevard plant.
</P>
<P>
   The plant, one of nine GM factories in the Dayton area, makes
suspension parts for GM and other automakers and employs about
2,700 hourly workers. It has sustained massive financial losses in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very pleased that the local agreement has been
ratified,'' said Lori Ostrander, the Kettering plant manager. ``The
agreement provides the plant with a framework to create a very
bright future in an increasingly competitive world. It helps
protect the work we currently have and should allow us to grow the
business,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of the tentative agreement distributed to workers this
week called for the elimination of about 400 jobs by the of this
year, mostly through attrition. But GM officials said Thursday the
plant is unlikely to lose the 400 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have many employees eligible to retire and the agreement
contains incentives for them to do so,'' said GM spokesman Jim
Hagedon. ``We anticipate that nearly all of these people will be
replaced by new employees hired at competitive wage and benefit
rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, new workers will be paid $8 an hour and won't
reach $10 an hour until they work at the factory for 10 years.
Under the previous wage scale, new workers earned about $9 an hour
and could make more than $14 an hour after 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, new workers and their families will not be eligible
for a company-provided health care plan during their first year and
other health care benefits will be reduced during and after their
employment. Under the old contract, new workers and their families
enjoyed immediate health care coverage and wider health care
benefits after they retired.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also calls for the implementation of a gain-sharing
program for new workers and employees at the bottom tier of the
wage scale. Gain-sharing will replace the traditional
profit-sharing program and means new workers will receive a
``bonus'' based on the plant's performance. It has lost $50 million
over the past two years. The traditional profit-sharing plan paid
dividends based on GM's overall performance.
</P>
<P>
   Workers in the top two wage tiers will have the choice of using
either the gain-sharing program or the profit-sharing plan.
</P>
<P>
   Retiring workers also have the choice of receiving a $15,000
lump sum payment or a $10,000 credit toward a new GM car and $6,000
cash.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative agreement was reached last week, about 20 minutes
before J.T. Battenberg, president of GM's huge Delphi Automotive
Systems parts division, was ready to make a final decision on
whether to sell the plant, according to union officials. As many as
15 automotive companies had shown interest in buying the factory.
</P>
<P>
   GM also had threatened to move about 600 jobs at the plant to
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Severe financial losses also put the two Dayton GM brake plants
on Wisconsin Boulevard and Needmore Road in jeopardy of being sold
or closed. Those plants employ 3,400 hourly workers who are
represented by United Auto Workers Local 696. But a recent
agreement prevents GM from selling the brake plants until January
2000

 &HT;    Medicaid should pay for home care, group says
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Charles Moore, paralyzed in a car accident in
1995, made some progress after he came home from the hospital.
Using a wheelchair to get around and a ventilator to breathe, the
20-year-old San Antonio resident learned to use a computer and
regained some feeling in his arms and legs.
</P>
<P>
   Then he turned 21.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid, the federal-state health program for certain
low-income people, helped Moore's parents pay for the therapists
and nurses who cared for him at home _ until he became an adult.
Texas and many other states guarantee Medicaid benefits only for
adults who are being cared for in nursing homes or similar
facilities. The state doles out some Medicaid money for care at
home, but there are long waiting lists to get it _ as many as 8,000
people for some programs.
</P>
<P>
   Two advocacy groups for the disabled say the policy violates the
Americans with Disabilities Act. One of those groups _ Americans
Disabled for Attendant Programs Today, known as ADAPT _ filed a
complaint Thursday with the U.S. Department of Justice. The other
group, Advocacy Inc., is representing Moore in a lawsuit against
the state agencies that administer the Medicaid program for Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups point out that the federal law passed in 1990
mandates that services be provided ``in the most integrated setting
appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with
disabilities.'' The groups argue that for many people, including
Charles Moore, that place is at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 21 years old. He doesn't want to be in a nursing home. We
don't think he belongs in a nursing home,'' said Moore's father,
also named Charles.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Health and Human Services Commissioner Don Gilbert, who
oversees the Medicaid program, didn't discount the groups'
arguments. It's up to the federal government, he said, to clarify
whether states have to guarantee Medicaid money to people who
choose to be cared for outside of institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all kind of boils down to, what is the federal government's
expectations on waiver programs and what is ADA's implications for
how these people get the services they need,'' Gilbert said.
</P>
<P>
   ADAPT member Stephanie Thomas said she's tired of excuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need more than sympathy; we need motion. Everyone agrees
and then nobody does anything,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   The main stumbling block, she said, is money, and the state
could increase its share.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state has to provide the services to anyone who's
eligible. So if you have limited state dollars, and you have to do
the nursing homes, then obviously you'll have to limit
community-based services,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said ADAPT is pushing federal legislation that would
force states to put home- and community-based care on a par with
nursing homes and other facilities. She said states that have made
the change have saved money, because many patients don't need the
comprehensive and expensive care that nursing homes provide.
</P>
<P>
   But Katherine Hinson of the Texas Health Care Association, which
represents most nursing homes in Texas, said the change could
increase costs because 24-hour care for patients who need the most
help is more expensive at home than in nursing homes.

 &HT;    ``Monica flu'' sweeps Nation
 &HT;    By Laura A. Bischoff and Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The public's disgust with President Clinton's affair may mean
Democrats stay home on Election Day while outraged Republicans turn
out in higher numbers, political pollsters said.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican Capitol Hill aide called it ``Monica flu.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That turnout effect may have a devastating effect on local
Democrats,'' said John Green, a political science professor at the
University of Akron.
</P>
<P>
   Al Tuchfarber, a Univeristy of Cincinnati professor and director
of the Institute for Policy Research, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if two, three or four percent of Democrats stay home,
it's a problem if you got a close race,'' he said. For example,
Tuchfarber said the Clinton scandal may have an impact on the 6th
District congressional race between incumbent Democrat Ted
Strickland and Republican Nancy Hollister, who on Thursday called
for Clinton's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Leland, however, said he
did not think the scandal will have any effect on elections in
Ohio. He added that he believes the Starr investigation is nothing
more than a political witch-hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland, who has publicly criticized Clinton for his affair
and for lying to conceal it, said he has not had voters ask him
about the issue when he campaigns in southern Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried about the turnout issue,'' Strickland said, ``but
quite frankly, I was worried about it before all this.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tuchfarber said that since 1870, in elections midway
through a president's second term, the White House's party has lost
numerous congressional seats _ averaging 44 in the House of
Representatives and seven in the Senate. So even without the
Clinton scandal, Democrats are facing a historically tough election
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Abernathy, spokesman for the Ohio GOP, said the situation
is so volatile it's difficult to predict where things will stand by
Nov. 3. ``It does hurt the institution of the presidency, he added.
``Whoever comes in after this, you have a rebuilding job to do.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in
Washington, a spokeswoman said they've taken ``occasional calls''
from candidates looking for advice on how to deal with the Clinton
scandal on the stump, but not many.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have in our favor is that the voters are sick of the
distractions,'' said Olivia Morgan, spokeswoman for the committee.
``They want to talk about the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan said her group tries to emphasize campaigning on such
things as Social Security and health care reform, as well as the
need for improvements in education.
</P>
<P>
   She said the committee already was pushing a strategy to boost
voter turnout even before it was clear the Starr investigation
would peak so close to Election Day, but she acknowledged that the
challenge could be greater now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, that is indeed where our efforts need to be
focused,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also said a recent `fly around' across the country with U.S.
Rep. Richard Gephardt, the Missouri Democrat who is the House
minority leader, found little interest in the scandal among voters
in various congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as our candidates stick to their message, they will be
judged individually,'' Morgan said.

 &HT;    Dell predicts steady growth in PC industry
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ While economic turmoil that began in Asia last
year is spreading to more countries and Japan's woes show no signs
of easing, the personal computer industry will continue to grow at
a percentage rate ``in the mid-teens'' for the next three to five
years, Dell Computer Corp. founder Michael Dell predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters before a speech in Dallas, Dell said
demand will be driven by several factors, including the continued
decline in PC prices and pressures for small and large businesses
to gear up so they can compete in global markets.
</P>
<P>
   Higher performance and declining prices, which stem from falling
costs of computer components, are causing many companies to speed
up replacement of older computers, especially as 2000 approaches,
he said. They can solve the year 2000 problem by buying new PCs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, large and small businesses around the world will
upgrade their computer systems so they can compete more effectively
in a global marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, in some ways, this is not a discretionary expenditure,''
Dell said. ``You're going to need computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Percentage sales increases of PCs, in terms of units and not
dollars, have been in the mid-teens in recent years. International
Data Corp. on Tuesday estimated that sales would rise 11 percent in
the second half of this year after rising just 8 percent in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   Dell, noting that Dell's Asia-Pacific and Japanese business grew
34 percent in the second quarter while overall PC shipments in the
region fell 9 percent, indicated his company would grow several
times faster than the industry.
</P>
<P>
   His assurance stems from 18 consecutive quarters of record
revenues, which have helped make Dell the fastest-growing and most
profitable of the major PC companies. In the second quarter ended
Aug. 2, Dell's revenues were $4.3 billion, up 54 percent from the
year-earlier quarter. Dell shares on Thursday fell $2.37 1/2 to
$54.75.
</P>
<P>
   At 33, Dell is the PC industry's longest-tenured chief
executive. His speech drew the largest audience ever at the Dallas
Business Forum luncheon. His confidence has become part of his
trademark, but he avoids seeming arrogant because of his disarming
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may sound weird, but we've gotten used to growing at the
rate that we have,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Dell acknowledged that the company's rapid growth
has been painful at times.
</P>
<P>
   He described the company's growth in 1993, the year after sales
boomed 127 percent from $890 million to $2.1 billion, as both
``thrilling'' and ``incredibly scary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The year after that, we hit the wall in pretty spectacular
fashion and split into thousands of pieces,'' Dell said.
</P>
<P>
   In its 1994 fiscal year, Dell posted a $35.8 million loss on
$2.8 billion in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   But mistakes associated with uncontrolled growth taught the
company valuable lessons, he said. For example, a company must
understand the economics of running a business before it develops
its strategy. Once the strategy is set, the business can determine
what structure is needed to achieve the strategy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get these in the wrong order, you totally screw
yourselves up,'' Dell said.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer, which employs about 13,000 workers in Central
Texas and is the area's largest private employer, added 2,400 jobs
in the second quarter, Dell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're looking for a job and you want to move to Austin,
come on down,'' he said. ``We've got one for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the talk, a member of the audience asked Dell whether
he thought Microsoft Corp. is ``too big.''
</P>
<P>
   The huge software company, whose programs run more than 90
percent of the world's personal computers, is battling U.S.
Department of Justice charges that it is using its near-monopoly
status to stifle competition.
</P>
<P>
   As he has in the past, Dell lauded the spread of Windows
operating systems because having one system be the standard for so
many PCs simplifies decisions for PC makers and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Cost of computer products and training employees to use them
would be higher if there were several competing systems, Dell said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he opposes government efforts to influence what products
consumers buy.

 &HT;    Nature group works to keep land out of developers' reach
 &HT;    By R. Michelle Breyer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ More than a thousand acres of prime ranch land
in Southwest Travis County, Texas, is going on the market next
month.
</P>
<P>
   But potential buyers can forget about building hundreds of
houses, office buildings or shopping centers on these large tracts.
They must agree to preserve the land's rural character _ forever.
</P>
<P>
   The sale is one of the latest projects for the Nature
Conservancy of Texas, which is acquiring property for the City of
Austin as part of Proposition 2. Passage of the measure in May gave
the city $65 million to buy land and development rights above the
Edwards Aquifer to protect water quality.
</P>
<P>
   The conservancy is a nationwide nonprofit organization that
attempts to balance the interests of property owners, the business
community and the environment _ groups often at odds with one
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``They understand there's more than one side to an environmental
issue,'' said Frank Niendorff, president of NAI/Commercial
Industrial Properties Co., a local commercial real estate firm.
``They understand there are economic issues at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   The conservancy emerged in 1951 from a professional association
of ecologists seeking a way to turn their knowledge of nature into
positive action for conservation. The conservancy has created the
largest private nature sanctuary system in the world, protecting
more than 10 million acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our basic mission remains the same _ to conserve land,
preserve natural resources and work cooperatively with communities,
landowners, businesses and government entities to seek consensus to
achieve this end,'' said Niki Frances McDaniel, spokeswoman for The
Nature Conservancy of Texas, based in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas chapter was started in the 1960s by a handful of
volunteers. The first purchase was the Attwaters Prairie Chicken
National Wildlife Refuge in Colorado County, which is home to the
endangered Attwaters Prairie Chicken. The Texas chapter has
conserved land from the Piney Woods of East Texas to the peaks of
the Davis Mountains in West Texas to the Blackland Prairies near
Dallas. The conservancy owns 37 nature preserves in the state,
totaling 77,178 acres.
</P>
<P>
   The conservancy has spent tens of millions of dollars acquiring
land.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nature Conservancy is in a position to move quickly to
protect sensitive land,'' said Holly Minch, spokeswoman for the
Sierra Club conservation organization.
</P>
<P>
   From a 121year-old limestone settler's cabin on the Barton Creek
Habitat Preserve, the three employees of the conservancy's Hill
Country field office work to protect environmentally sensitive
land. The conservancy owns 4,500 acres in the Austin area,
including the 4,084-acre preserve along Barton Creek in Southwest
Travis County, home to the endangered black-capped vireo and the
golden-cheeked warbler. The land once was slated for 7,500 houses.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the conservancy buys property. In others, it
purchases the development rights. In 1994, the conservancy acquired
the Barton Creek Habitat Preserve from the Resolution Trust Corp.,
the now defunct federal agency that was charged with cleaning up
the savings and loan debacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really have a lot of options besides buying land
outright,'' said Jeff Francell, a field representative for the
conservancy.
</P>
<P>
   The conservancy is using both tools in its current collaboration
with the City of Austin. The goal of Proposition 2 was to acquire
5,000 acres in the Barton Springs watershed, a peanut-shaped area
along the Hays-Travis county line stretching from the Village of
Bee Cave to Bear Creek.
</P>
<P>
   After the city pinpoints a property, the conservancy contacts
the owner and negotiates a price. ``The city doesn't have the staff
to buy $65 million in land,'' Francell said.
</P>
<P>
   Six tracts _ ranging from 200 to 400 acres _ have been approved
for sale in October. The land will be sold for 40 percent to 70
percent less than what the city paid for it, depending upon how the
property is appraised with the restrictions. With the proceeds from
the sale, the conservancy will help the city buy more property to
protect, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Francell believes this land will appeal to people who want large
ranches within a half hour of downtown Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The city owns conservation easements on the property, which
means development will always be restricted, even after it's sold.
</P>
<P>
   Landowners may sell or donate these easements, which often are
called development rights, to either a nonprofit conservation
organization or a government agency.
</P>
<P>
   In the city's case, property owners are being paid about half
the value of their land for these easements. In other areas around
the nation _ including Tucson, Ariz., Upstate New York and
Portland, Ore. _ conservation easements also have been bought to
protect land and water.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to money, the sale of conservation easements
provides landowners with a way to protect their property, even with
growing pressure to sell or develop it. They also may get income
and estate tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Ayres, a conservancy advisory board member and a financial
supporter, said he is considering donating a conservation easement
on some of the 6,700 acres his family owns along Barton Creek in
Southwest Travis County.
</P>
<P>
   ``A conservation easement is forever,'' Ayres said. ``It would
be a guarantee that certain features of the property would be
protected, even after our ownership ends.'' David Armbrust, one of
the city's most influential real estate attorneys, said he believes
conservation easements may enable the city to accomplish its
objectives, even in a market with soaring property values.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The conservancy) has really been able to think outside the
box in terms of creative approaches to difficult issues,'' said
Armbrust, an attorney with Armbrust Brown &AMP; Davis. ``Without some
creative thinking, I don't think the city's resources would go near
as far as they would otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nature Conservancy brings to the table the business side
of doing deals, crafted in a way to protect the environment,''
Armbrust said.

   AUS-BKC-TEXAS-HUNTER Freshman guard Hunter won't play until 1999
By Randy Riggs Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   Freshman guard Vohn Hunter has enrolled at the University of
Texas as a partial academic qualifier, meaning he will not be
available to play until the 1999-2000 basketball season.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter's absence leaves Coach Rick Barnes with eight available
scholarship players. The Longhorns are especially thin at guard,
with only DeJuan ``Chico'' Vazquez, Ivan Wagner and junior-college
transfer William Clay on scholarship. Barnes plans to fill out the
roster with walk-on help. Hunter and forward Chris Owens, the
former Texas high school player of the year who transferred from
Tulane after his freshman season, can practice with the Longhorns,
although Owens recently had arthroscopic surgery to repair damaged
knee cartilage and will be rehabilitating for about 12 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes was recruiting Friday and was unavailable for comment,
but in a statement he expressed disappointment that Hunter won't be
available this season. Hunter, who committed to UT last fall,
graduated from St. Raymond's High School in New York, but admission
to college also requires a qualifying score on a college-entrance
exam.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Hunter) will make us a better team by being able to
practice with us,'' Barnes said. ``Hopefully he can use this year
to get a head start in the classroom, work on his strength and
conditioning, and improve his game.''

 &HT;    Reading UCLA defense biggest challenge for Longhorns QB
 &HT;    By Mark Wangrin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a radiologist it's all there in black and white.
</P>
<P>
   You read a formation, compare it with your body of knowledge,
detect a flaw and figure the best ways to treat it.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Walton's voice takes on a tone of awe when he talks
about how his uncle, Dallas radiologist Dr. Leber Beall, can see
something where others do not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at X-rays everything looks the same to me, but he can
find something a little different,'' Walton says. ``He's the most
laid-back guy, but when he goes to work he attacks it. He looks at
an X-ray like he's loving it, like you or I would look at a
football game.''
</P>
<P>
   Walton hopes to someday be a radiologist. He hopes to have that
same discerning eye. He hopes to find potential problems before
others.
</P>
<P>
   He'll get that chance on Saturday, as the University of Texas
starting quarterback when he'll start counting heads on the UCLA
side of the line, figuring out which one will be in his face this
time.
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect to halfback Ricky Williams, whose Heisman
candidacy undergoes its first of back-to-back tests, and to the UT
defense, which hopes to at least give UCLA quarterback Cade McNown
the semblance of a similar test, Walton might be the most important
figure in the Longhorns' chances of pulling off a stunning win.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike Williams and the defense, the best scenario is for
him to go unnoticed. No interceptions. No fumbles. No sacks. A .600
or better completion percentage.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Walton drew the start against UCLA when James Brown
injured his ankle late in an opening-night win over Rutgers. With a
full week of practice behind him, Walton was ready. ``I remember
feeling real good going into the game,'' he recalled. ``I felt I'd
have a big day. ... it didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Take away the four sacks, and Walton didn't have that awful of a
day statistically _ 16 of 27, 145 yards and one interception _ but
he also lost a fumble and the confidence of the coaching staff. His
practice reps dropped afterward and he played in only three of the
last nine games, attempting only 18 more passes, all against
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I lost confidence,'' the 6-foot-5-inch,
225-pound senior said. ``Some of the coaches said I did because of
the way they said I held myself afterward. But I wasn't down, like
I was a horrible person who couldn't do anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of people do that with a quarterback. It comes
with the job. Along with the head coach you get too much credit
when the team does well and too much criticism when you don't do
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Walton's biggest ally on Saturday, next to Williams, is the
change in offense and blocking schemes. Last year the Horns used
five- and seven-step pass drops and a sliding protection scheme.
Whichever way the pocket slid, UCLA always seemed to be able to
overload the other side, and the Horns were unable to adjust. The
Bruins sacked Walton and backup Marty Cherry seven times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I had been in the offense for a long time, I was a
little fuzzy on the protection schemes,'' Walton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally figured it out in the second quarter, after getting
our butts kicked, to adjust the other way,'' said guard Ben Adams.
``After that ... I'm not sure if we gave up, or just thought it
hopeless.''
</P>
<P>
   Walton's pass drops this year are 3 to 3 1/2 yards shorter _ the
longest will be five steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``That won't leave the tackles out by themselves as much,''
Walton said. ``Now they can push (the rusher) by. Last year if they
pushed them buy, they pushed them right into my face.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of pressure off the line,'' Adams said. ``Last
year we had to protect for four to five seconds. This year,
two-and-a-half to three. People think that half-second or so isn't
much, but it is to an offensive lineman.''
</P>
<P>
   The protection schemes, Walton said, allow him to read the
defense before the snap and know where the pressure will come, if
it does.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a team that believes in free-releasing the backs
(into pass patterns, regardless of the blitz), as we do, the
quarterback has to know,'' said offensive coordinator Greg Davis.
``That's why we stress always having your eyes in the right
place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll know 95 percent of the time which guy's not going to get
blocked,'' Walton said. ``It's my job to get rid of it before he
gets here.''
</P>
<P>
   That means that even if all goes right, he'll take some hits
just after releasing the ball. ``That's OK _ it's the blind-side
ones that I'm not expecting that I'm not big on,'' Walton said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Horns are confident in their new scheme, there is
the uncertainty of what UCLA will do. The Bruins will blitz _ who
wouldn't, after last year's grand success? _ but they have a new
defensive coordinator, former Oregon defensive whiz Nick Aliotti,
and a new 3-4 scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number one thing in picking up the blitz is knowing what
they can do,'' Adams said. ``We don't know what they'll do. What's
also good is failing at it. If we know where it's coming from, we
can fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This one's a little scary,'' Davis said. ``We have nothing to
go on except newspaper articles and some film from '94 (when
Aliotti was at Oregon).''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that calms Davis' heart has been the play of Walton.
Of Walton's 61 snaps against New Mexico State, about 30 were
audibles, in which he checked off from a package of anywhere from
two to five plays. Several of the Horns' big plays _ a 29-yard pass
to Bryan White on the first drive, a 15-yarder to Wane McGarity in
the third quarter _ were on audibles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time he got on the phones, what he told me was what was
happening,'' Davis said. ``Sometimes when they come out of a game,
they'll tell you things that aren't happening.''

 &HT;    Babe Ruth: Nice. Got a church key?
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ You've got to wonder how Babe Ruth would react to all
of this home-run hype we've been putting up with lately, if he were
around to watch.
</P>
<P>
   What would the carouser, drinker and party animal say to Mark
McGwire, the new, clean-cut home-run champion, if the Babe were
alive today?
</P>
<P>
   Babe was a different sort of guy than McGwire. The Babe was the
kind of guy who was coming in about the same time McGwire is
getting up. While McGwire was taking extra batting practice, the
Babe would be taking extra cheese on that sandwich. He liked his
groceries. He would have liked McGwire's, too.
</P>
<P>
   So here's one thing I'll bet the Babe would say to McGwire:
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice drive, Boy Scout, but let's see you pull off that stunt
after a couple dozen of these performance-enhancing hot dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, ``Workout? I thought you said cookout.'' I have a hard time
imagining Babe hanging out at the gym, unless he'd wandered in
there to check out the babes in the aerobics class.
</P>
<P>
   Another remark the Babe might have made to McGwire? ``You might
think you're hot stuff, but I'll bet you can't steal second carting
this gut.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, better still, ``Has anybody got the phone number for that
Lewinsky chick?''
</P>
<P>
   David Letterman, in his Top 10 list on the same subject, says if
Ruth were with us today he would say:
</P>
<P>
   ``Yo quiero Taco Bell!''
</P>
<P>
   Or, ``I've just come back from the dead _ so can't Denny's give
me a free meal?''
</P>
<P>
   Or, ``You call this a baseball team? Where are all the fat
guys?''
</P>
<P>
   Probably so, and you know the Babe would hire Colonel Sanders as
his agent. And he'd have a provision in his contract calling for a
bucket of chicken with every run batted in. And when he got the
Happy Meal at McDonald's he'd crab through the drive-up window,
``Keep the toy and fork over the longneck.''
</P>
<P>
   But what would the Babe think about fans trying to snag the
record-setting home run ball so they could sell it for a million
bucks?
</P>
<P>
   The Babe was a practical man who understood the true value and
meaning of life. So I know exactly what he'd say today, if he reset
the homerun record:
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, kid, you can keep the ball, if you go to the store and
bring back a 12-pack and a bag of ice.'' The Babe was my kind of
guy.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the other things I'll betcha Ruth would say, if
he were with us today to watch all of this foolishness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say hot shot, go ahead on to Disney World. I'm headed for
Arby's.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Does Conans deliver to this dugout, or am I going to have to
call Domino's?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we get started, did anybody remember to bring a bottle
opener?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I look heavy. I've been retaining Bud.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice arms, big guy, but can that butt hold up these XL
Sansabelt pants?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget the androstenedione and pass the mustard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So you can hit it 580 feet. I can still throw up farther than
you can.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, choir boy. Do you know the name of the skirt sitting on
the owner's lap behind first base?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a load of dingers, but my body fat percentage is higher
than your batting average.''

 &HT;    Billy Smith, coach-You want to make something of it?
 &HT;    By Brian Biggane
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNRISE, Fla. _ They don't make goaltenders like Billy Smith
anymore. And that should come as a relief to any NHL player who
likes to be aggressive around the opponent's net.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who moves up from goaltending coach to assistant coach on
the staff of first-year Florida Panthers coach Terry Murray, ruled
the New York Islanders' crease during a playing career that lasted
from 1971-89. He was arguably the feistiest, most combative _ some
would say dirtiest _ goaltender ever to play the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember guys coming in on breakaways, their head down as
they came over the blue line, and Billy would be all the way out
there to meet them,'' said Denis Potvin, the Islanders' Hall of
Fame defenseman who played in front of Smith his entire 15-year
career. ``He was as aggressive as they came.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 47, has a simple explanation for the way he played.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my day everybody ran the goalie; it was a different era,
where (opponents) got away with a lot of stuff in the crease and
you wound up having to defend yourself, so you ended up scrapping a
lot. Or else you had a defense that would fight for you all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately for me, I enjoyed doing it myself.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't fighting skills or feistiness that Murray wants Smith
to impart to the Panthers, however. It's his knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very smart hockey person,'' Murray said, ``a Hall of
Fame goaltender who played a long time under a great coach in Al
Arbour. There's a lot of information inside that head, and he's
going to contribute in any area he wants to.''
</P>
<P>
   Brought into the Florida organization in 1993 by then-General
Manager Bob Clarke, Smith has bounced back and forth between the
Panthers and their minor-league teams tutoring goaltenders. This
year he'll work exclusively with the NHL club, and not just with
the goalies.
</P>
<P>
   Potvin, now a Panthers broadcaster, said he never expected Smith
to go into coaching, primarily because the goalie wasn't much of a
communicator during his playing days.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's so sincere, and the kids have really taken to him,''
Potvin said. And, he added, his expertise is extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always ask him what he thinks when I see a kid like (Eric)
Fichaud or (Jocelyn) Thibault. He'll say, `Needs two years, needs a
year. He's got three areas to work on.' Right away he's identified
what the kid does wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the one thing he does like, if the kid wants to work and
listens to him, he'll have Smitty on his side because he's very
loyal.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically for a guy who was usually quiet, it's the
communication area where Murray will be seeking Smith's help the
most.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will work with the goaltenders, but also with the
communication with the defense,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the problems with goaltenders today is they don't talk
enough,'' Smith said. ``When the puck is coming back into your end,
you see everything, so you should be telling the defense what to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's first team, the Los Angeles Kings, never did figure him
out. Called up to replace the injured Rogie Vachon for five games
in the 1971-72 season, Smith got into a couple of fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could hear a pin drop in the arena,'' he said. ``At that
time nobody on the team wanted to fight. Rumor has it I was too
violent for that team, so they left me unprotected in the expansion
draft.''
</P>
<P>
   Islanders General Manager Bill Torrey _ now the Panthers'
president _ grabbed him and, after he split duties with Gerry
Desjardins for two seasons, Smith became No. 1 in 1974-75. He went
on to record 305 career wins, which ranks 14th on the all-time
list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing with Billy Smith you knew what was expected,'' Potvin
said. ``He was very black-and-white, which was exactly what you
wanted as a defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wouldn't overhandle the puck ever, and if he went out and
handled it behind the net he always left it. So there was no
guessing or hesitation on our part, and his whole game was like
that, to us very predictable.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's temper, however, was unpredictable. Potvin recalled that
the Islanders held training camp in Atlanta in his rookie season of
1972-73, and Smith had let it be known that, to be on the safe
side, no one would be allowed to shoot for the top corners.
</P>
<P>
   ``So Ernie Hickey was a teammate, and he had a big booming
slapshot and a big curve in his stick,'' Potvin said. ``So he came
down and fired on Smitty, and before he could get behind the net
Smitty met him and they fought.
</P>
<P>
   ``My jaw dropped, and we all quickly got the feeling that when
Billy said something, there was no gray area.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Smith also broke many a stick with two-handers to the
back of opponents' legs, not all of his messages were of the
physical variety. Murray recalled that during pre-game warmups
before an Islanders-Washington game, Smith played a mind game with
the Capitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stood there at center ice watching our whole warmup,''
Murray said. ``Then he went back into the net, took three shots,
and came back and stood and watched the rest of our warmup.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I went back to Bryan (Murray, his brother and the Caps'
coach at the time) and said, `(Kelly) Hrudey's the guy for sure
tonight; Smitty only took three shots.' Smitty goes in and starts
and shuts us out. So he proved the mental part of the game was
huge.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his antics, Smith was suspended only once; he got three
games for brawling with Chicago's Curt Fraser. ``The replay showed
he did some stuff before I ended up striking him, but I got three
games anyway,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I loved it to be exciting. Nobody enjoyed it more than I
did. I think sometimes that's what we forget, that it's a game. The
money's great, but it's also the fun of playing the game, the fun
of winning. It never changed for me from playing in our backyard.''

<P>
   GLASS-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON When the Iraqis pulled the plug on
U.N. weapons inspections in January, President Clinton threatened a
missile shower unless Saddam Hussein backed down. When the Iraqis
did it again last month, Clinton belched some dragon smoke while
showing he had no fire left in his belly. Why the turnabout?
(Glass, Cox News Service) MOVED 9/10.
</P>
<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ It looks as though we'll be able to get out of
the year without having to watch affirmative action being killed
after all, and a new study makes it plain why the reprieve is good
news all around. (Teepen, Cox News Service) MOVED 9/10.
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ Once upon a time, like viewing a damsel in
sackcloth, we were left only to imagine what people like Jerry
Falwell, Pat Robertson and other agents of Piety Inc. wanted when
they asked American voters for the keys to the family car. Now we
don't have to imagine. With Kenneth Starr as Elliot Ness and Bill
Clinton as Al Capone, the sex police have their man, Mr. Big, and a
whole new law enforcement industry. (Young, Waco Tribune-Herald)
MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   KELSO-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ You've got to wonder how Babe
Ruth would react to all of this home-run hype we've been putting up
with lately, if he were around to watch. What would the carouser,
drinker and party animal say to Mark McGwire, the new, clean-cut
home-run champion, if the Babe were alive today? (Kelso, Austin
American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MINTER-COLUMN _ Phillip Wiseman came home with a question. ``Why
did they give sunrise and sunset in Central Standard Time in
1939?'' he asked.After my diligent research in an attempt to answer
Phillip's question, an undercover operative who sometimes sneaks me
information off the newspapers' computers discovered two previously
published articles on the subject, one by columnist Elliott Brack,
the other by science writer Charles Seabrook. (Minter, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ The action word of the 90s would appear to be
``apology.'' Seemingly, everyone wants everyone else to apologize
for something, whether it happened yesterday, last month, last
year, earlier in the century or in previous centuries. (Kleinberg,
Cox News Service) MOVED 9/10.
</P>
<P>
   MSKUBE-COLUMN _ It's a truism that we never see ourselves the
way others see us. The lenses of self-interest and prejudice always
obstruct more light than they admit, and sometimes they are little
more than mirrors of what we wish to believe. Nowhere is this more
true than in the endless, and endlessly tiring, debates about the
state of American education. (Skube, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
MOVED 9/10.

<P>
   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ For the good of the republic,
President Clinton needs to be impeached. The nation needs a full,

manipulating scoundrel. (Nethaway, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED 9/10.

poignant moment. (Kabat, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.

 &HT;    EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 13
 &HT;    Clinton must muster the courage to resign
 &HT;    A Journal-Constitution joint editorial
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This joint editorial reflects the conclusions of the editorial
boards of both The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution,
acting separately and independently.
</P>
<P>
   The American people seem doomed to a guided tour of hell in days
to come, exposed against their wishes to the details of a
particularly seamy presidential scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Only one person can spare us that nightmare. By resigning,
President Clinton would be surrendering the office he worked his
entire life to achieve, and would give his enemies the reward they
have long sought. No one as proud and stubborn as the president
could take such a step easily.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, by making that sacrifice, Clinton would save the nation
from a protracted trauma that will otherwise cripple the presidency
and Congress and further discredit a political system already held
in low esteem. A president more concerned with the national
interest than his own self-preservation would realize that
resignation is his only responsible option.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, Bill Clinton has shown himself incapable of such
sacrifice. He is a complex man with many attractive qualities, but
in the end his character has been defined by his crass selfishness.
It is that trait _ perjury and adultery are merely its symptoms _
that has rendered him unfit to continue as president.
</P>
<P>
   At repeated points in the progression of this scandal, Clinton
has faced a critical choice: ``Should I do what is best for the
country, or should I do what is best for me?'' If at any of those
points, Clinton had chosen to do what was best for the country, we
would not be in this mess. But he could not.
</P>
<P>
   Look how it began: In late 1995, the Paula Jones
sexual-harassment case was already hanging over Clinton's head, and
his political opponents had made it clear that they thirsted for
his blood. Yet, despite the danger to his presidency, Clinton
decided to begin a sexual relationship with a 21-year-old intern
named Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   That reckless decision _ to gamble his presidency on the ability
of a starry-eyed young woman to keep her mouth shut _ has been
described as evidence of terrible judgment, and it is. But even
more troubling, it demonstrates that Clinton valued his own
gratification too highly and took his duty as president too
lightly.
</P>
<P>
   That choice between his duty as president and his own
self-interest presented itself again when Clinton was asked, in a
sworn deposition in the Jones case, whether he had sexual relations
with Lewinsky. As a father and husband, his natural instinct was to
deny the charge and commit perjury. According to the polls, most
Americans do not judge Clinton harshly for that decision. They
accept his explanation that he was trying to protect himself and
his family.
</P>
<P>
   However, the act of committing perjury has consequences for the
president of the United States that do not apply when the crime is
committed by most husbands and fathers. The president takes an oath
before the entire nation to uphold the law; by committing a felony,
he violates that solemn oath.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the nature of his perjury, Clinton's decision to lie
will not by itself generate the public anger necessary for
impeachment. It is nonetheless important, because it satisfies the
constitutional requirement that impeachment involve ``high crimes
and misdemeanors.'' At some later date, it and other charges could
provide the technical foundation for impeachment motivated by
other, less legal considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's most cowardly and indefensible refusal to put the
national interest ahead of his own well-being involves his
protracted attempt to conceal his perjury and infidelity. Over the
past several months, he has enlisted the full force and majesty of
his office in defense of his deception, and in the process damaged
the presidency both as an institution and as a national symbol.
</P>
<P>
   For example, his forceful and falsely sincere denial of an
affair with ``that woman, Miss Lewinsky'' put his Cabinet members
in a tough position. They had to either publicly proclaim their
confidence in the president, or resign. He forced them to put their
personal and professional credibility on the line in defense of
what he knew to be a lie.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, because Clinton refused to tell the truth, Secret
Service agents were compelled to testify before a grand jury,
compromising what had been assumed to be a confidential
relationship between a president and the agents assigned to protect
him. And when White House aides were summoned to testify about what
they knew, government lawyers fought the subpoenas on a claim of
executive privilege. The courts overruled that claim, a decision
that will haunt future presidents who want to consult honestly with
staff on legally delicate matters.
</P>
<P>
   When he first looked the American people in the eye and denied
his infidelity, Clinton might not have envisioned the full impact
of his deception on other people. But as the consequences became
clear, and as he saw the toll his deception was taking on members
of his staff and Cabinet, he had the obligation to intervene, to
halt the weakening of the presidency by the simple act of telling
the truth.
</P>
<P>
   But to save his own hide, he remained silent.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on Aug. 17, unable any longer to maintain fiction as
fact, Clinton faced the nation. Here was his last chance to put the
interests of the nation above his own. By coming clean, by laying
the truth on the table for all to see, Clinton had the opportunity
to move the scandal to a quick resolution. And again, he failed.
Even then, he could not see beyond his own narrow needs; he could
not summon the courage to do what was right for the nation.
</P>
<P>
   With the filing of the Starr report, the process toward
impeachment will accelerate. Until the contents of that report are
clear and President Clinton has had a chance to respond, final
judgment on impeachment would be premature. The forced removal of a
president through constitutional means is a grave matter that
should not be handled hastily.
</P>
<P>
   The case for resignation, on the other hand, is already clear.
At the moment, Clinton's selfishness still serves as a blindfold,
rendering him unable to see the seriousness of his situation. But
just as time eventually forced him to admit both his lies and his
infidelity, it may eventually force him to consider resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Democrats are already abandoning the nominal head
of their party. At some point in the next few weeks, they may go to
him and ask him to remove his blindfold and look honestly at the
ugly spectacle that he has wrought.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe then he will find the courage to do what is best for
his country.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Other strange stories lurk behind Clinton saga
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Keepin' up with the times:
</P>
<P>
   -- While we're all marching double time to catch up with the
president's slap-and-tickle, another outing too: Helen Chenoweth,
R-Idaho, has admitted to a long affair in the '80s with a married
man, thus joining Rep. Dan Burton, R-Indiana, similarly confessed,
at the sinners' bar.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult not to sink to the unworthy -- scrap that. It's
impossible not to sink to the unworthy thought, and with enjoy it a
fisson of even less worthy delight, that Chenoweth had it coming.
She's one of those holier-than-thou ``family values'' demagogues in
which the Republican Party specializes; and to boot has been an
apologist from the militias that plague the western mountain
states.
</P>
<P>
   Chenoweth, caught out by her hometown newspaper, has assured
voters, as her re-election date nears, ``I've asked for God's
forgiveness, and I've received it.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe so, but Idaho voters might ask the Federal Elections
Commission if it can verify the endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   -- Medical researchers say they've scored a big breakthrough in
fertility wizardly with a technique that, as it becomes more
refined, will let would-be parents pick the gender of their child.
</P>
<P>
   That's a step in the right direction but a small one. We'll
really be getting somewhere when science can decide not just what
gender but which child.
</P>
<P>
   Will it be one who picks up the toys without being hounded? Can
we be guaranteed one who will never want any sneakers that cost
over $25? A girl who thinks one Barbie doll is enough? A boy who'll
say, ``Thanks, dad, but I really don't feel the need for a car of
my own.''
</P>
<P>
   This new technology will be fully mature and a boon to the
peaceable disposition of society when it can engineer kids who, at
30, won't still be hanging around the house saying, ``Hey, man. I'm
just getting my act together.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Easily the strangest stories in the run-up to Mark McGwire's
awesome No. 62 were in the sudden sunburst to quasi-news
speculating on the vicious tax liability that would hit any poor
soul in the stands who was unlucky enough to catch the historic
ball.
</P>
<P>
   Surely you heard all the alarmism. Talk radio's professional
hysterics, especially, had a baseball field day as they anticipated
the predations of the bogeyman Internal Revenue Service. Assuming
the ball had a value of a million dollars, the income tax for the
fan unable to dodge it would be $143,750. Or if the fan gave it
away, like a hot coal, the gift tax would be about the same -- by
some accountings adding up to a breath-sucking $287,500.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem with all this was that it was perfect nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the impending tax mugging, IRS didn't dare say it
wouldn't happen. Tax-law sharpies all over the country would take
any disclaimer as a loophole-to-be. But in practice, that sort of
taxation simply doesn't happen. No reporter seems to have tried to
find a single real-life case to support the speculation.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal's editorial page took the prospect as
evidence of the evil handiwork of Democrats and one more reason to
elect a Republican Congress. The Wall Street Journal editorial page
has the all the whimsy of an anvil.

PROVING THE MERITS OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Every once in a while a book comes along that
transforms a national debate, and I'm not talking about special
prosecutor Kenneth Starr's report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The former presidents of Princeton and Harvard, William G. Bowen
and Derek Bok, respectively, have written a book that would have
been nice to have two years ago. Remember the polemic-fest about
affirmative action? It's hard to forget at the University of
California at Berkeley. Because of the Regents' 1996 ban on taking
race into account in admissions, the number of black and Latino
freshmen has been cut in half _ from not nearly enough to nearly
nil.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen and Bok's book, ``The Shape of the River,'' released
Thursday by Princeton University Press, shows us what the
University of California system, the state and the nation will be
missing by not considering race when admitting students.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't 1996's abstract debate about ``fairness,'' ``merit''
and what might happen to black students admitted to elite
universities despite lower SAT scores than whites.
</P>
<P>
   The book is about what really has happened to almost 50,000
black and white students admitted to 28 elite colleges and
universities. Twenty years of their lives, incomes and
contributions to the nation have been charted in a database
developed by the Mellon Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen, an economist, is now president of that foundation. When I
spoke to the authors by phone on Thursday, Bowen said with both
pride and understatement: ``We've gotten beyond the anecdotal
level.''
</P>
<P>
   I'll say they did. There's no tired talk about the mythical
``level playing field.'' This book is packed with data, charts and
sober analyses of the things that happened in the lives of black
and white students admitted to top colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   A racially diverse student body turns out to be ``relentlessly
positive,'' to use Bok's words.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Bok assures Californians that the Mellon Foundation
is working on a study of Latino students attending leading
universities.
</P>
<P>
   The authors' main claim is that black graduates of elite
universities and professional schools have been ``the backbone of
an emergent black middle class,'' which has been the most important
racial development in America in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen and Bok admit up front they are in favor of using race as
a factor in college admissions (but not necessarily in other areas
of life). However, even they were startled by how the data
supported considering race in college admissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``A host of findings proved to be surprising to us,'' Bowen
said. ``Who would have predicted that black graduates would earn
professional degrees at a greater rate than white graduates?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very gratified to discover that black graduates are
more active than whites in community service activities,'' Bok
said. ``You heard so much about how blacks who make it turn their
backs on their community.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were surprised by the degree of support for diversity in
these universities,'' said Bowen, who admitted that even he and Bok
had been affected by media reports about the supposed separation of
races on campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Among the myths demolished by Bowen and Bok is the main argument
by critics of affirmative action _ the notion that affirmative
action hurts black students by pushing them into schools they're
not prepared for.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, said Bok, ``the more selective the institution, the
better they did.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes not just grades, but performance in life, as
measured by advanced degrees, income, satisfaction and community
service.
</P>
<P>
   Then we have the matter of how students are selected for these
selective institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Californians may have thought they were raising standards by
eliminating affirmative action in the UC system. What has happened,
ironically, is an instant impoverishment of a great university and
a great state.
</P>
<P>
   We've become fixated on scores on multiple-choice tests, rather
than seeing whole individuals and the entire community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has never made any sense to equate merit with test scores
alone,'' Bowen said. ``Our principal point is that discussion of
who has merit for admission to any institution must start with the
purposes of the institution.''
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of a university is not to provide a chance for
young, test-savvy individuals to make piles of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The objective is to look at the total class of students who
have a lot to teach each other,'' Bowen said. ``The other aim is to
make a contribution to society by educating those who are most
likely to be leaders in the best sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Their data show unequivocally that black graduates of elite
colleges and professional schools become leaders in all fields _
and at a greater rate than whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the case for race-sensitive admissions needs to be
made in very positive terms,'' Bowen said.
</P>
<P>
   It's better than pretending that the issue of race went away,
and we're in some game of all against all on a flat playing field.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of metaphors, the title of ``The Shape of the River''
is taken from Mark Twain's ``Life on the Mississippi.'' It refers
to the difficulty and vital importance of knowing a river at the
center of American life.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen and Bok extend Twain's image to a river of young talent,
particularly black talent.
</P>
<P>
   They've done a good job of charting that river. Unfortunately,
California has put a dam in its tributary.
</P>
<P>
   Enough metaphors, though. Read the facts.

   &UR; EDITORS: The New York Times Syndicate looks at bilingualism,
politics and celebrity in its Hispanic Heritage Month (Sept.
15-Oct. 15) package. Two articles examine how assimilation has
altered the attitude of many Hispanics toward their native language
and culture. An article from Hispanic magazine describes how the
GOP is cultivating the Hispanic vote after getting a shellacking in
the 1996 election. Finally, we offer a three-part excerpt from the
autobiography of TV superstar Christina Saralegui.

</P>
<P>
   More and more English is creeping into Spanish-language
television these day. It's a tacit acknowledgement that an
increasingly large percentage of the Hispanic population is heavily
assimilated and speaks English often and well. This trend is also
reflected, Zate notes, in magazines such as the bilingual Latina
and in advertising. (slugged:

 &UR; From ``Something to Declare'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I now speak my native language with an accent,'' best-selling
novelist Julia Alvarez declares in this lyrical and touching essay
from her forthcoming book. After Alvarez emigrated from the
Dominican Republic in the 1960s, her English became fluent as her
Spanish become dormant, a reflection of the growing distance
between herself and her native culture. ``It wasn't until I failed
at first love, in Spanish, that I realized how unbridgeable that
gap had become,'' she writes. (slugged:

</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 presidential race, only 21 percent of the Latino
vote went to GOP candidate Bob Dole. With Hispanics and other
minorities making up an increasingly large percentage of the
electorate, the Republican Party is recognizing the need to win
over a constituency that associates the GOP with English-only,
anti-immigrant policies. One step in this effort is the formation
last year of the New Majority Council. (slugged:

 &UR; By CRISTINA SARALEGUI &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; From ``My Life as a Blonde,'' published by Warner Books &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She is the host of the most-watched TV program in the world _
Cristina Saralegui, the Cuban refugee who worked her way to the top
of the publishing world, then switched to television to create the
``El Show de Cristina,'' viewed daily by 100 million worldwide. Her
story, told in three 1,200-word parts, will inspire anyone to do
more with what they have. Born into wealth and ease, Cristina lost
it all when her family fled to Miami during Castro's revolution.
She defeated racism and poverty with an undaunted will to work and
to believe in her own dreams. Her mission in this book is to show
her readers how to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   In Part 1, Cristina tells of the family's flight to Miami and
how hardships in this country transformed her from a little rich
girl to a compassionate and supremely confidant businesswoman. In
Part 2, Cristina recounts the romance of meeting Marcos Avila of
Miami Sound Machine and of how they overcame her family's
resistance to her marrying a rock star 11 years her junior. In Part
3, Cristina describes her new life in TV, the grueling pace, the
seductions of fame and influence. (slugged:

 By MARIA ZATE  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    While channel surfing on a Sunday night, a familiar face pops up
on the TV screen. It's Giselle Fernandez, former anchor of ``NBC
Nightly News'' and currently anchor of the entertainment show
``Access Hollywood.''
 &HT;    She greets an enthusiastic crowd with the usual pleasantries,
and then slips the phrase ``muy caliente'' into her monologue. She
continues to speak in English and then drops another Spanish word.
She introduces her guest, actress Maria Conchita Alonso.
 &HT;    You check the channel. This isn't ``Access Hollywood.'' The show
is ``Cafe Ole with Giselle Fernandez'' and it's on Galavision, a
Spanish-language cable network.
 &HT;    But she's speaking English. Wait a minute, what's going on here?
 &HT;    Welcome to bilingual television. English-language format and
content are gaining a foothold in a market once occupied solely by
Spanish media. From TV programming to magazines and radio,
bilingual and English-language media continue to grow as a way to
reach the Hispanic market.
 &HT;    Consider recent news items: Emilio Estefan plans to produce a
Latin-themed, English-language TV program for Universal Television
Group.
 &HT;    Latina magazine, a national bilingual women's magazine backed by
the publishers of Essence, switches from quarterly to monthly
distribution.
 &HT;    The Los Angeles Times announces plans to capture more Hispanic
readers, perhaps through a special Hispanic section in English.
 &HT;    In radio, several stations in the top 10 media markets use a
bilingual format with ratings success.
 &HT;    Why this growth in English and bilingual media?
 &HT;    ``It's the next logical step of the evolution of the Latino
population in the U.S.,'' says Alex Nogales, president of the
National Hispanic Media Coalition in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    As immigration laws tighten, and as the second- and
third-generation population increases, marketers and programmers
will focus on capturing the attention of the assimilated and
acculturated Hispanics, he explains.
 &HT;    In fact, the impetus behind Galavision's decision to air
bilingual programming lies in the success of another show that
celebrates assimilation and acculturation. Last year Galavision
began running a weekly half-hour bilingual show called ``Que Pasa
U.S.A.,'' a situation comedy that first aired on PBS in Miami back
in the '70s. The show represents a microcosm of what's happening in
the Hispanic media landscape.
 &HT;    ``Que Pasa U.S.A.'' features a Cuban family, with members from
three generations living under one roof.
 &HT;    ``It's about their experience in trying to retain their culture
and also to assimilate,'' says Michelle Bella, director of
marketing and communications for New York-based Galavision, the
cable network of Univision Communications Inc. in Miami. Galavision
reports that it reaches 7.5 million homes in the United States.
 &HT;    When Galavision first started airing ``Que Pasa U.S.A.,'' the
Nielsen ratings showed that it connected with viewers. This alerted
network executives to try more bilingual programming.
 &HT;    ``Until now, the English-dominant and bilingual crowd has
largely been ignored on TV,'' says producer Jeff Valdez, who along
with partner Bruce Barshop co-manage Si TV, the company that
produces ``Cafe Ole.'' Based in Culver City, Calif., Si TV produces
English-dominant and bilingual programming with Latino appeal.
 &HT;    According to the latest census information on language use at
home, assimilated Hispanics represent about 54 percent of the
Hispanic market. Data from 1990 show that 46 percent of Hispanics
speak Spanish and also speak English ``very well.'' Another 8
percent speak no Spanish. There are 26 percent who speak
predominantly Spanish and don't speak English well or not at all.
The remaining 20 percent say they speak both Spanish and English
``well.''
 &HT;    ``So far, (Hispanic) programming has pulled only from the
Spanish-dominant side,'' Valdez says. The new Galavision fare
creates ``a more competitive programming environment,'' he
believes.
 &HT;    But programming goes beyond language, emphasizes Barshop at Si
TV.
 &HT;    ``It's not just about language. It's also about programming
produced in the U.S.,'' he says. ``Most Spanish-language programs
come from South America and Mexico. Si TV is about recognizing the
cultural difference.''
 &HT;    Coverage of Hispanic culture in English has proven successful
for publishers, as exemplified by the bilingual women's magazine
Latina in New York. Latina publisher Christy Haubegger says she
chose a bilingual format to reflect the assimilated Latina in the
United States. No other magazine addressed the market in this way,
she says.
 &HT;    ``As a second generation Mexican-American who is bilingual,
reading in Spanish is very difficult,'' she says. ``And the
magazines published in Latin America don't relate to my life here
in the U.S.''
 &HT;    Thousands of women appear to share Ms. Haubegger's perceptions.
Latina debuted in May 1996 as a quarterly and this year changed to
monthly distribution. The magazine reports an unaudited circulation
of 300,000. According to Ms. Haubegger, Latina has attracted
high-end advertisers that previously had never placed ads in
Hispanic media.
 &HT;    ``We are the only Hispanic advertising that Ralph Lauren has
ever done, and that the Gap and Tommy Hilfiger has ever done,'' she
says.
 &HT;    Latina illustrates the growing support among advertisers for
English-language Hispanic media. However, many Hispanic advertising
agencies feel threatened by the use of English in the Hispanic
market. But the agencies created this problem in the first place,
says Nogales at the National Hispanic Media Coalition.
 &HT;    ``For years these agencies have been telling advertisers that
they will deliver the Latino market. And they've been telling
clients the only way to do it is to reach them in Spanish,'' he
says. ``They decided to put everything into the Spanish-speaking
game and now they're reaping what they sowed. These agencies are
going the way of the dinosaurs.''
 &HT;    The advertiser's message, including its language, must fit the
target audience.
 &HT;    Levi's, the San Francisco-based clothing manufacturer, launched
its first bilingual ads this summer for its jeans. Created by
Bromley, Aguilar &AMP; Associates in San Antonio, the ads, which ran on
Univision and Telemundo in Los Angeles and Houston, feature young
Hispanics who speak mostly Spanish with some English.
 &HT;    Michelle Vasquez, marketing manager at Levi's, says research
showed bilingual ads were the best way to reach the product's
target market _ young males ages 15 to 25.
 &HT;    ``We looked at the census data and found that 74 percent of this
group are bilingual,'' she says.
 &HT;    Despite an increase in English media that targets Hispanics,
Spanish-language advertising will continue to keep growing, says
Alejandro Ruelas, director of ethnic marketing at Anheuser-Busch in
St. Louis.
 &HT;    ``I think the political climate and the anti-Hispanic
initiatives out there will instill more pride in our people and
ultimately bring us back to our language,'' he says. ``There's the
growth of retro acculturation where a lot of Hispanics are making
an active effort to learn Spanish and consume Spanish-language
media. The Spanish language is here for the long haul and it will
continue to grow by leaps and bounds.''
 &HT;    So far, broadcast heavyweights Univision and Telemundo don't
perceive a threat on the language front. In fact, Univision
recently asked McDonald's to re-edit its latest TV commercial
``English Lessons'' for the air. The spot contained too much
English dialogue.
 &HT;    Univision accepts only all-Spanish advertising, says a company
spokeswoman in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    ``Our success comes from ads and programs being 100 percent
Spanish. Our viewers keep coming back because they are most
comfortable with that programming,'' she says.
 &HT;    At least one man is confident that Hispanics welcome culturally
relevant English media.
 &HT;    ``I've been getting (negative) comments about the viability of
targeting this market since the beginning,'' says Valdez at Si TV.
 &HT;    ``I say to those people, `Laugh all you want to now, but the
times, they are a-changing.'''

 By JULIA ALVAREZ  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 Excerpted from ``Something to Declare,'' published by Algonquin
Books  
 &HT;    The inevitable, of course, has happened. I now speak my native
language ``with an accent.'' What I mean by this is that I speak
perfect childhood Spanish, but if I stray into a heated discussion
or complex explanation, I have to ask, ``Por favor, puedo decirlo
en ingles?'' Can I please say it in English?
 &HT;    How and why did this happen?
 &HT;    When we emigrated to the United States from the Dominican
Republic in the early 1960s, the climate was not favorable for
retaining our Spanish. I remember one scene in a grocery store soon
after we arrived. An elderly shopper, overhearing my mother
speaking Spanish to her daughters, muttered that if we wanted to be
in this country, we should learn the language.
 &HT;    ``I do know the language,'' my mother said in her
boarding-school English, putting the woman in her place. She knew
the value of speaking perfect English. She had studied for several
years at Abbot Academy, flying up from the island to New York City,
and then taking the train to Boston.
 &HT;    At school, there were several incidents of name-calling and
stone-throwing, which our teachers claimed would stop if my sisters
and I joined in with the other kids and quit congregating together
at recess and jabbering away in Spanish. Those were the days before
bilingual education or multicultural studies _ when kids like us
were thrown in the deep end of the public school pool and left to
fend for ourselves. Not everyone came up for air.
 &HT;    Mami managed to get us scholarships to her old boarding school
where good manners and tolerance and English skills were required.
We were also all required to study a foreign language, but my
teachers talked me into taking French. In fact, they felt my
studying Spanish was equivalent to my taking a ``gut course.''
Spanish was my native tongue, after all, a language I already had
in the bag and would always be able to speak whenever I wanted.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, with Saturday drills and daily writing assignments,
our English skills soon met school requirements. By the time my
sisters and I came home for vacations, we were rolling our eyes in
exasperation at our old-world Mami and Papi, using expressions like
``far out,'' and ``what a riot!'' and ``outta sight'' and ``believe
you me'' as if we had been born to them.
 &HT;    As rebellious adolescents, we soon figured out that conducting
our filial business in English gave us an edge over our strict,
Spanish-speaking parents. We could spin circles around my mother's
``absolutamente no'' by pointing out the flaws in her arguments, in
English.
 &HT;    My father was a pushover for pithy quotes from Shakespeare, and
a recitation of ``the quality of mercy is not strained'' could
usually get me what I wanted.
 &HT;    Usually. There were areas we couldn't touch even with a
Shakespearean 10-foot pole _ the area of boys and permission to go
places where there might be boys, American boys, with their mouths
full of bubblegum and their minds full of the devil.
 &HT;    Our growing distance from Spanish was a way in which we were
setting ourselves free from that old world where, as girls, we
didn't have much say about what we could do with our lives. In
English, we didn't have to use the formal ``usted'' that
immediately put us in our place with our elders. We were
responsible for ourselves and that made us feel grown-up.
 &HT;    We couldn't just skirt culpability by using the reflexive: The
bag of cookies did not finish itself, nor did the money disappear
itself from Mami's purse. We had no one to bail us out of American
trouble once we went our own way in English. No family connections,
no tio (uncle) whose name might open doors for us.
 &HT;    If the world was suddenly less friendly, it was also more
exciting. We found out we could do things we had never done before.
We could go places in English we never could in Spanish, if we put
our minds to it. And my sisters and I put our combined four minds
to it, believe you me.
 &HT;    My parents, anxious that we not lose our tie to our native land,
and no doubt thinking of future husbands for their four daughters,
began sending us ``home'' to the Dominican Republic every summer to
Mami's family in the capital.
 &HT;    And just as we had once huddled in the school playground,
speaking Spanish for the comfort of it, my sisters and I now hung
out together in ``the D.R.,'' as we referred to it, kibitzing in
English on the crazy world around us, the silly rules for girls,
the obnoxious behavior of macho guys, the deplorable situation of
the poor.
 &HT;    My aunts and uncles tried unsuccessfully to stem this tide of
our Americanization, whose main expression was, of course, our use
of the English language.
 &HT;    ``Tienen que hablar en espanol,'' they commanded. ``Ay, come
on,'' we would say as if we had been asked to go back to baby talk
as grown-ups.
 &HT;    By now, we couldn't go back as easily as that. Our Spanish was
full of English. Countless times during a conversation, we were
corrected, until what we had to say was lost in our saying it
wrong. More and more we chose to answer in English even when the
question was posed in Spanish.
 &HT;    It was a measure of the growing distance between ourselves and
our native culture _ a distance we all felt we could easily retrace
with just a little practice. It wasn't until I failed at first
love, in Spanish, that I realized how unbridgeable that gap had
become.
 &HT;    He was a honey-skinned young man with wonderful dimples and a
pot belly that made him look like a Dominican version of the
Pillsbury doughboy. His name was Manuel Gustavo, but I
affectionately nicknamed him Mangu, after a mashed plantain dish
that is a staple of Dominican diet.
 &HT;    A few days after meeting him, Mangu's mother sent over an
elaborate dessert with lots of white frosting that looked
suggestively like a wedding cake.
 &HT;    When I tried to talk to Mangu about something of substance, the
conversation foundered. I couldn't carry on in Spanish about
complicated subjects, and Mangu didn't know a word of English. Our
silences troubled me. Maybe, my aunts were right. Too much
education in English could spoil a girl's chances in Spanish.
 &HT;    Evenings, Mangu would come over, and we'd sit on the patio and
try to make conversation or drive out to the country club in his
father's car to dance merengue and see what everyone else was
doing. What we were doing was looking for people to fill up our
silence with their talk.
 &HT;    I never had a Spanish-only boyfriend again. Maybe the
opportunity never presented itself, or maybe it was that as English
became my dominant tongue, too many parts of me were left out in
Spanish for me to be able to be intimate with a potential life
partner in only that language.
 &HT;    Still, the yearning remained. How wonderful to love someone
whose skin was the same honey-dipped, sallow-based color, who said
``concho'' when he was mad and ``cielito lindo'' when he wanted to
butter you up!
 &HT;    ``Ay, to make love in Spanish ...'' the Latina narrator of
Sandra Cisneros' story ``Bien Pretty'' exclaims. ``To have a lover
... whisper things in that language crooned to babies, that
language murmured by grandmothers, those words that smelled like
your house.''
 &HT;    But I wonder if after the Latina protagonist makes love with her
novio, she doesn't sit up in bed and tell him the story of her life
in English with a few palabritas thrown in to capture the rhythm of
her Latin heartbeat?

<P>
   On Sept. 16, 1997, a group of Republicans met in a conference
room at the Marriott Hotel in downtown Washington, D.C., to launch
the party's latest program to enlist minorities. The meeting ended
on an upbeat note, but it had started with a lot of soul-searching
and apologies.
</P>
<P>
   The sense was that Republicans were running out of chances with
Latino voters. This time they vowed they would get it right.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the hosts _ Republican National Committee chair Jim
Nicholson and co-chair Patricia Harrison _ the attendees included
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Sen. Ben Knighthorse Campbell
(R-Colo.), Rep. Henry Bonilla (R-Texas), Rep. J. C. Watts (R-Okla.)
and some prominent minority Republicans who had been enlisted to
lead the new charge.
</P>
<P>
   It had been almost a year since the Republicans had received one
of their worst thrashings from the Democrats in the presidential
elections. The Latino vote had flexed its muscle in almost total
repudiation of the Republican presidential candidate and platform.
</P>
<P>
   Months later some Latino communities still rankled with
anti-Republican sentiment. Warning signs flashed all over the
Republican domain.
</P>
<P>
   An unsolicited report prepared by Republican pollster Frank Lunt
stated, ``Our majority is at stake. Republicans barely maintained
their congressional majority in 1996, and a major reason their
support dropped from 1994 was the utter collapse of the Hispanic
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded, ``The Hispanic vote is up for grabs, and
it is up to individual Republican candidates to say in plain
English and prove by their actions that they deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Party strategist Stu Spencer, in a memo to California GOP
leaders, warned that they would be committing ``political suicide''
if they continued to alienate Hispanics instead of courting what
many party philosophers contend are natural allies.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Hispanic disenchantment, Spencer added, ``The trend is
obvious, and the political danger is real. We are dramatically
losing market share of the fastest growing segment of the
electorate.''
</P>
<P>
   The RNC is concerned about its political standing with Hispanics
but not necessarily impressed with the Luntz and Spencer
appraisals, which an RNC spokesperson considered exaggerated and
overly alarmist.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, if such ominous warnings sound like Chicken Little
to some, the party leaders now seem to accept that the sky could
fall on them if they don't move more decisively and intelligently
to rebuild their minority constituency, particularly Hispanics, to
the heights of the Nixon and Reagan years.
</P>
<P>
   Banking on a new vehicle to attract minorities to the party, the
GOP unveiled the New Majority Council at the September meeting. It
sounds and looks a bit like Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition,
encompassing Hispanics, African Americans, Asian Americans and
Native Americans in a collegial effort with the emphasis on the
word ``majority,'' which the Republicans say foretells the future
status of the ethnic electorate.
</P>
<P>
   On the Hispanic side, statistics tell it better. Today's U.S.
population is 72.5 percent non-Hispanic white and 27.5 percent
minority, with Hispanics making up 11 percent. According to the
U.S. Census, within 50 years the adult population will transform
into 52.8 percent non-Hispanic white and 47.2 percent minority,
with Hispanics making up 24.5 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   RNC co-chair Harrison says, ``We have to stop minority thinking
because we are now talking about a new majority. It's up to us to
move toward people we want at the table and not up to the people to
find the table.''
</P>
<P>
   She credits the late Lee Atwater, the former RNC chairman and
premier political swami, as the originator of this idea. Atwater
was developing what he called the ``big tent'' for the Republicans
at the time of his death, and Harrison says she is just building on
this concept.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the NMC will achieve its goal is another matter. The
council's message of ``heritage, hope and opportunity'' is not
exactly revolutionary, and it relies on the GOP's basic planks of
family values, quality education, crimefighting, entrepreneurship
and less government.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bonilla, who is emerging as the Republicans' Latino star,
says Latinos, by virtue of their culture and values, are ready-made
Republicans, but the party has been slow to mine this bountiful
lode of voters. He credits his own success to dogged community
outreach.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla is a three-term Republican congressman from an area long
known as a Democratic power base. He was the first Latino
Republican congressman elected from Texas, and he has won each
contest with 60 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla attributes his success to delivering the right message _
the Republican message, not a specially crafted Hispanic one _
personally to his constituents and listening to their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to show up at these communities as I do,'' he says.
``I try to get this across to our people, but it's the hardest
thing to make them understand that it's not hard to do and that we
don't have to change our message or our values.''
</P>
<P>
   To start making inroads with Hispanics, the GOP must overcome a
notoriously bad reputation of late for antagonizing Hispanics. The
Republicans are also known for constantly shooting themselves in
the foot on Latino sensitivities.
</P>
<P>
   The Pete Wilsons and Bob Dornans of the party don't help.
Neither do the issues of immigration, affirmative action and
English-only, all attributed to Republican politics.
</P>
<P>
   In the last presidential campaign, the Republican candidate, Bob
Dole, practically ignored the Hispanic constituency. Latinos
responded in kind by helping Clinton clobber him, delivering 72
percent of the Latino vote to the president. Hispanics nationwide
voted 21 percent for Dole, the lowest support among Hispanics for
any presidential candidate in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic congressional candidates also got 72 percent of the
Hispanic vote.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans contend that the Dole shellacking was an aberration.
They insist that better measures of Republican-Latino affinity are
Richard Nixon, the first candidate to seriously court the Latino
vote, and the Great Communicator, Ronald Reagan, still a hero to
many Latinos. Both won the Hispanic vote by large margins,
generating the largest Latino turnouts in a presidential election
up to now.
</P>
<P>
   Republican strategists point out that Latinos will respond to
the right message and messenger. They cite mayoral races in two
cities with large Hispanic populations.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani received 40 percent of the
Hispanic vote, and Richard Riordan of Los Angeles got 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who is building a
large Hispanic following that supporters are confident will
mushroom into a national constituency if he decides to run for
president.
</P>
<P>
   If Democrats have dominated the Latino constituency, it is
largely because they are better _ a lot better _ at exploiting the
issues and playing to Latino emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latinos have no problem with voting Republican,'' says Arturo
Vargas, executive director of the National Association of Latino
Elected Officials Educational Fund, which counts 5,400 members.
``They have shown it in the past, like in l984, when they gave
Reagan over 40 percent of their vote. It means the Republican Party
has the potential to attract Latinos. The Republicans have to
examine what has succeeded and what has driven Latinos away.''
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Gonzalez, president of the Willie C. Velasquez
Institute, suggests that the GOP was punished in 1996 by Latino
voters for its so-called extremist positions, but it doesn't mean
that Latinos have banished it forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``1998 will be the measure of whether this is a long-term trend;
I don't think it is,'' he says. ``The issues will not be the same,
and if you examine the polling trends, many Latinos consider
themselves undecided or independent.''
</P>
<P>
   A Tomas Rivera Policy Institute poll that asked if Latino voters
``lean'' toward Democrats, Republicans or ``neither way,'' 64
percent in California, 67 percent in Florida and 69 percent in
Texas gave the last answer.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans and their NMC are aware of Latino voting
tendencies by now, but since gaining a majority in Congress in
1994, Republicans have provided proof for critics who say the party
is anti-Latino.
</P>
<P>
   Every bit of English-only legislation was sponsored by a
Republican, and welfare and immigration reforms were spearheaded by
Republicans. If the Republican Party can acknowledge past mistakes
and make an honest effort to win Latinos to its style of
government, it's in for better times.
</P>
<P>
   If it fails once again, the consequences will again be
self-inflicted, and, many predict, long-lasting.

<P>
   Besides the hosts _ Republican National Committee chair Jim
Nicholson and co-chair Patricia Harrison _ the attendees included
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Sen. Ben Knighthorse Campbell
(R-Colo.), Rep. Henry Bonilla (R-Texas), Rep. J. C. Watts (R-Okla.)
and some prominent minority Republicans who had been enlisted to
lead the new charge.
</P>
<P>
   It had been almost a year since the Republicans had received one
of their worst thrashings from the Democrats in the presidential
elections. The Latino vote had flexed its muscle in almost total
repudiation of the Republican presidential candidate and platform.
</P>
<P>
   Months later some Latino communities still rankled with
anti-Republican sentiment. Warning signs flashed all over the
Republican domain.
</P>
<P>
   An unsolicited report prepared by Republican pollster Frank Lunt
stated, ``Our majority is at stake. Republicans barely maintained
their congressional majority in 1996, and a major reason their
support dropped from 1994 was the utter collapse of the Hispanic
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded, ``The Hispanic vote is up for grabs, and
it is up to individual Republican candidates to say in plain
English and prove by their actions that they deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Party strategist Stu Spencer, in a memo to California GOP
leaders, warned that they would be committing ``political suicide''
if they continued to alienate Hispanics instead of courting what
many party philosophers contend are natural allies.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Hispanic disenchantment, Spencer added, ``The trend is
obvious, and the political danger is real. We are dramatically
losing market share of the fastest growing segment of the
electorate.''
</P>
<P>
   The RNC is concerned about its political standing with Hispanics
but not necessarily impressed with the Luntz and Spencer
appraisals, which an RNC spokesperson considered exaggerated and
overly alarmist.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, if such ominous warnings sound like Chicken Little
to some, the party leaders now seem to accept that the sky could
fall on them if they don't move more decisively and intelligently
to rebuild their minority constituency, particularly Hispanics, to
the heights of the Nixon and Reagan years.
</P>
<P>
   Banking on a new vehicle to attract minorities to the party, the
GOP unveiled the New Majority Council at the September meeting. It
sounds and looks a bit like Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition,
encompassing Hispanics, African Americans, Asian Americans and
Native Americans in a collegial effort with the emphasis on the
word ``majority,'' which the Republicans say foretells the future
status of the ethnic electorate.
</P>
<P>
   On the Hispanic side, statistics tell it better. Today's U.S.
population is 72.5 percent non-Hispanic white and 27.5 percent
minority, with Hispanics making up 11 percent. According to the
U.S. Census, within 50 years the adult population will transform
into 52.8 percent non-Hispanic white and 47.2 percent minority,
with Hispanics making up 24.5 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   RNC co-chair Harrison says, ``We have to stop minority thinking
because we are now talking about a new majority. It's up to us to
move toward people we want at the table and not up to the people to
find the table.''
</P>
<P>
   She credits the late Lee Atwater, the former RNC chairman and
premier political swami, as the originator of this idea. Atwater
was developing what he called the ``big tent'' for the Republicans
at the time of his death, and Harrison says she is just building on
this concept.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the NMC will achieve its goal is another matter. The
council's message of ``heritage, hope and opportunity'' is not
exactly revolutionary, and it relies on the GOP's basic planks of
family values, quality education, crimefighting, entrepreneurship
and less government.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bonilla, who is emerging as the Republicans' Latino star,
says Latinos, by virtue of their culture and values, are ready-made
Republicans, but the party has been slow to mine this bountiful
lode of voters. He credits his own success to dogged community
outreach.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla is a three-term Republican congressman from an area long
known as a Democratic power base. He was the first Latino
Republican congressman elected from Texas, and he has won each
contest with 60 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla attributes his success to delivering the right message _
the Republican message, not a specially crafted Hispanic one _
personally to his constituents and listening to their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to show up at these communities as I do,'' he says.
``I try to get this across to our people, but it's the hardest
thing to make them understand that it's not hard to do and that we
don't have to change our message or our values.''
</P>
<P>
   To start making inroads with Hispanics, the GOP must overcome a
notoriously bad reputation of late for antagonizing Hispanics. The
Republicans are also known for constantly shooting themselves in
the foot on Latino sensitivities.
</P>
<P>
   The Pete Wilsons and Bob Dornans of the party don't help.
Neither do the issues of immigration, affirmative action and
English-only, all attributed to Republican politics.
</P>
<P>
   In the last presidential campaign, the Republican candidate, Bob
Dole, practically ignored the Hispanic constituency. Latinos
responded in kind by helping Clinton clobber him, delivering 72
percent of the Latino vote to the president. Hispanics nationwide
voted 21 percent for Dole, the lowest support among Hispanics for
any presidential candidate in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic congressional candidates also got 72 percent of the
Hispanic vote.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans contend that the Dole shellacking was an aberration.
They insist that better measures of Republican-Latino affinity are
Richard Nixon, the first candidate to seriously court the Latino
vote, and the Great Communicator, Ronald Reagan, still a hero to
many Latinos. Both won the Hispanic vote by large margins,
generating the largest Latino turnouts in a presidential election
up to now.
</P>
<P>
   Republican strategists point out that Latinos will respond to
the right message and messenger. They cite mayoral races in two
cities with large Hispanic populations.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani received 40 percent of the
Hispanic vote, and Richard Riordan of Los Angeles got 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who is building a
large Hispanic following that supporters are confident will
mushroom into a national constituency if he decides to run for
president.
</P>
<P>
   If Democrats have dominated the Latino constituency, it is
largely because they are better _ a lot better _ at exploiting the
issues and playing to Latino emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latinos have no problem with voting Republican,'' says Arturo
Vargas, executive director of the National Association of Latino
Elected Officials Educational Fund, which counts 5,400 members.
``They have shown it in the past, like in l984, when they gave
Reagan over 40 percent of their vote. It means the Republican Party
has the potential to attract Latinos. The Republicans have to
examine what has succeeded and what has driven Latinos away.''
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Gonzalez, president of the Willie C. Velasquez
Institute, suggests that the GOP was punished in 1996 by Latino
voters for its so-called extremist positions, but it doesn't mean
that Latinos have banished it forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``1998 will be the measure of whether this is a long-term trend;
I don't think it is,'' he says. ``The issues will not be the same,
and if you examine the polling trends, many Latinos consider
themselves undecided or independent.''
</P>
<P>
   A Tomas Rivera Policy Institute poll that asked if Latino voters
``lean'' toward Democrats, Republicans or ``neither way,'' 64
percent in California, 67 percent in Florida and 69 percent in
Texas gave the last answer.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans and their NMC are aware of Latino voting
tendencies by now, but since gaining a majority in Congress in
1994, Republicans have provided proof for critics who say the party
is anti-Latino.
</P>
<P>
   Every bit of English-only legislation was sponsored by a
Republican, and welfare and immigration reforms were spearheaded by
Republicans. If the Republican Party can acknowledge past mistakes
and make an honest effort to win Latinos to its style of
government, it's in for better times.
</P>
<P>
   If it fails once again, the consequences will again be
self-inflicted, and, many predict, long-lasting.

 By CRISTINA SARALEGUI  
 From ``My Life as a Blonde'' 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It isn't easy to be rich.
 &HT;    Everyone wants the people who make it to have started at the
bottom. I didn't start at the bottom, I must admit.
 &HT;    My grandfather was a millionaire. In Cuba he was called the
Paper Czar because he was co-owner of the most important magazines
on the island and also held the monopoly for selling paper.
 &HT;    I was born in Miramar, a wealthy suburb of Havana, where
everyone's main worry was to make sure that during hurricane season
his yacht was secured at the club. I lived in Miramar until we had
to emigrate to Miami in 196O, shortly after Fidel Castro's
revolution had overthrown the dictator Fulgencio Batista.
 &HT;    In the United States, I faced something I had never known:
prejudice. In those early days there were not many Latinos in
Miami. And even though I was blond, with light eyes, my accent and
behavior were unmistakably foreign to the ``natives.''
 &HT;    I didn't understand why I was called ``spic,'' until someone
explained that the word came from the way a Spanish speaker
pronounces the word ``speak,'' shortening the vowel to spic. But
then I couldn't understand why they said, ``Hey, spic, why don't
you go back where you came from?'' when none of the ancestors of
those ``natives'' were from the United States either.
 &HT;    I enrolled in the University of Miami, where I studied
communications with a minor in creative writing. During the last
year of the course, the university required an internship with some
publication.
 &HT;    I chose Vanidades because of my deep sentimental ties to that
magazine. My family had just sold it to a Venezuelan publisher and
his partner. I thought, All right, I'll work as an intern for a
year, and that's the last they'll see of me.
 &HT;    I learned to write every kind of article, from pieces on beauty
and fashion to international news. Then when Frank Calderon, the
editor in chief of Buenhogar (the Spanish version of Good
Housekeeping) was appointed editor of Cosmopolitan en Espanol and
the first thing he did was to hire me from Vanidades as his first
staff writer.
 &HT;    Like a good Cosmo girl, I was 26 and decided to move from our
home on Key Biscayne and rent a small apartment. My father was
going through one of his hard times and was trying to sell the
mansion on Key Biscayne to cut back on expenses. I moved, both to
be independent and not to be a burden on my parents.
 &HT;    I must admit that I had a more difficult time than other girls
my age because I was totally spoiled and immature.
 &HT;    My first excursion into cleaning consisted of buying two spray
cans of foaming cleanser: one for the bathroom, the other for the
oven. From time to time I mixed them up and cleaned the bathroom
with the oven cleaner and the oven with the one for the bathroom.
 &HT;    My mailbox was overflowing with bills. My money ran out because
I earned so little, and I began to lose my credit. My father was
now flat broke and couldn't help me either. I kept moving to
cheaper and cheaper apartments.
 &HT;    Eventually I realized my life was a mess, and I knew I had to
calm down.
 &HT;    One of the young men I was going out with was named Tony
Menendez. He was a firefighter and real estate salesman. I told
myself, ``I need to slow down and have a baby. This is a good man,
and I know he will be a good father.'' I was that cool in my
calculations.
 &HT;    I married him and a year later, at 29, had my first daughter,
Cristina Amalia Menendez y Saralegui, whom we called Titi. When our
daughter was born, Tony and I moved into a small house on Key
Biscayne.
 &HT;    As time went by, I realized that my husband, although he was
working every day (and getting dressed every day in jacket and
tie), simply wasn't selling anything. We had to move into my
father's three-room apartment, with my dachshund, which was covered
with fleas that immediately infested my mother's carpet.
 &HT;    One day my husband said, ``You have to get a job and help out.''
 &HT;    I looked him straight in the eye and said; ``I left my job to
start a family with you. If you ask me to go back to work, you'd
better be ready for whatever happens.''
 &HT;    I wasn't capable of working in an office from 9 to 5 and
trudging home like an automaton to pick up my life. That was work,
not a career. And for me it had to be a career.
 &HT;    I went to Cosmo and visited my former boss. ``I'm sorry,'' he
told me.
 &HT;    On my way out of the building, in desperation I turned and went
to see Elvira Mendoza, whom I had left in the lurch at Vanidades to
go work for Cosmopolitan.
 &HT;    ``Elvira, I have a baby girl now. Here's her picture,'' I began.
 &HT;    She answered, ``What a beautiful child!''
 &HT;    Then it all poured out. I told her the truth and confessed that
I needed a job.
 &HT;    Her reply was instantaneous. ``Well, of course, I'll give you a
job.''
 &HT;    So I came full circle back to where I'd begun, because she paid
me almost the same salary I'd started at, the lowest scale allowed.
 &HT;    I worked at all hours. I did anything they told me. The owner
suggested that I take on the additional responsibility of being
editorial coordinator for Intimidades, a new small-format magazine
in Caracas, Venezuela, that focused primarily on information about
sexuality.
 &HT;    I worked the whole day at Vanidades, writing and editing. Then,
at 5 o'clock, I would save my article on the computer, get into my
car, eat a sandwich as I drove, pick up my baby from the sitter,
put her in her car seat and take her to the home of my
mother-in-law, Marieta, a saint who worked at a factory that made
ballet and exercise clothing.
 &HT;    I would run back to my office, sit back down at the computer,
and with that crazy schedule we got Intimidades under way.
 &HT;    Then one day Frank Calderon, for reasons I don't know to this
day, banged his typewriter against his desk and walked out. The
management offered me his position as editor in chief of
Cosmopolitan.
 &HT;    I was terrified. But I accepted for two reasons: hunger and
ambition. My daughter had turned me into a career woman. And
careers are like children: They grow! I had to dare to grow with
mine.
 &HT;    That was MY CAUSE during the 10 years I directed Cosmopolitan.
Little by little I shaped the magazine to be a motivating force for
working women.
 &HT;    Here are some of the things I've learned:
 &HT;    _ List in a notebook the most important things in your life,
family, job, health, etc.
 &HT;    _ On the basis of those principles, define the goals you want to
reach.
 &HT;    _ Every goal must have a deadline, whether 20 years or two
months.
 &HT;    My goals have been varied because I am convinced that happiness
leads to success but that we are happy only when we achieve a
balance in our lives.
 &HT;    That's why I divide my goals into categories:
 &HT;    _ Cultural goals: Take classes in a foreign language, read a
book every two weeks.
 &HT;    _ Family goals: Have a lasting marriage and children who become
good men and women.
 &HT;    _ Spiritual goals: Read everything that might open the eyes of
my spirit and help my soul evolve.
 &HT;    Every morning review your goals for self-improvement and keep
the last day of the month to check, point by point, what you have
done to reach them.
 &HT;    Begin right now.

 By CRISTINA SARALEGUI  
 From ``My Life as a Blonde'' 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    One day a representative of CBS Records called to ask me a favor
with these fateful words:
 &HT;    ``We just signed a local group called Miami Sound Machine. We're
going to book them into Regine's in New York and launch them as the
company's new artists and we need you to back us up in print.''
 &HT;    At the same time _ life's little coincidences _ another friend,
a newspaperman in Puerto Rico, had called to say that he was
organizing a festival of Caribbean music in Cancun, Mexico, and he
wanted me to recommend the hottest U.S. group playing Latin music.
 &HT;    I recommended Miami Sound Machine.
 &HT;    On the plane carrying us to the festival in Cancun I met Emilio
and Gloria Estefan and (by chance!) Marcos Avila, the band's bass
player.
 &HT;    Emilio and Gloria were very pleasant companions during that
trip, and we quickly became friends, so spontaneously and sincerely
that soon Tony and I began hanging out with them. Since we lived
only five minutes away, we went everywhere together.
 &HT;    Seeing them, watching how happily they were married, I realized
how unhappy I was. I began to realize that following their example
of working together and getting ahead together, I had to change the
circumstances I found myself in.
 &HT;    One day Emilio said, ``I'm going to Peru with Gloria and the
band. You've filed for divorce. Your problems are out of your
hands. Why don't you let me invite you to come with us?''
 &HT;    It was my destiny to meet my destiny.
 &HT;    Emilio who's always joking, began selling me on Marcos, I don't
know why. He said over and over, ``Marcos Avila is my right hand
and a very serious fellow. Why don't you two get together?''
 &HT;    Now I believe that maybe Emilio sensed the chemistry between
Marcos and me before the things happened I'm going to tell you
about.
 &HT;    But I listened and thought, ``Marcos is short, fat,
short-tempered and close-mouthed. And he's married! I like tall,
handsome, elegant men. And I'm short-tempered too. We'd make a
terrible couple!''
 &HT;    One night we all went to a discotheque. I was at Gloria and
Emilio's table but had gone to the ladies' room. There I saw a
black girl and a white girl get in a fight _ with razor blade _
over a musician.
 &HT;    The musician was Marcos! I froze. I did what you do on automatic
pilot and, eyes straight ahead, walked out the door.
 &HT;    As I stepped outside, Marcos came up and said, ``Want to
dance?''
 &HT;    ``Not on your life!'' I answered, and went back to the table to
see how everything turned out.
 &HT;    That night Marcos explained that he was going through the stage
of total upheaval that precedes a divorce. Sometimes he left home
and took refuge in his grandmother's house, where he hid out before
going back to his own house to see his baby girl.
 &HT;    As for me, my husband and I were legally separated.
 &HT;    We were two miserable souls that met like homeless people under
a bridge. Marcos says today that by then he had determined to
captivate me. It's true, we began to see each other differently.
 &HT;    One night after a concert, we all got together in a suite and
had a tremendous party. Afterward Marcos offered to walk me back to
my room. He came in with me, sat on my bed, began to massage my
back, and said, ``If you and I make love ... ''
 &HT;    He corrected himself. ``No. When you and I make love, you're
going to see what a real man is like.''
 &HT;    I pretended I hadn't heard him. I quickly told him good night,
gave him a stupid kiss on the cheek, and he left. But I was left
with that promise in my heart. The next day I got up at 6 a.m. and
carefully painted my toenails red.
 &HT;    That night he came back, and he was better than his promise. It
was like making love with someone for whom you had been created
with that one purpose in mind. The earth moved, bells rang and I
was left stupefied because that had never happened to me and I was
35 years old!
 &HT;    It was well worth painting my toenails.
 &HT;    From that moment Marcos began his campaign to move into my house
so I wouldn't go out with anyone else. He intended that after eight
years of marriage to one man I should pass directly to him, with no
romantic interlude in between.
 &HT;    Marcos is 11 years younger than I am. At that time he had a
ponytail halfway down his back, but a buzz cut in front. And he had
an earring. After all, he was a musician.
 &HT;    My parents were totally opposed to our relationship. My first
marriage had been plagued by economic problems. At one point my
father asked if I was proposing to support men all my life.
 &HT;    To add to the complications, Titi, my daughter, was a holy
terror! I remember the first day Marcos came to the house. Titi had
some plastic handcuffs, and under the pretense of playing cops and
robbers, she cuffed him to the metal stairway and threw away the
key--so he couldn't be with me. We had to break the handcuffs to
get them off.
 &HT;    Faced with that situation, I told Marcos, ``You'll have to win
Titi over, because I'm not going to marry you if she doesn't want
me to.''
 &HT;    By the end of our first year together, Titi was so fond of
Marcos that she told me one day, ``Mami, he loves us. He's nice.
Why don't we marry him?''
 &HT;    All I could do was laugh!
 &HT;    For the wedding I wore a white cotton dress I'd bought in
Mexico, and Titi wore one just like it. I bought white flowers for
my hair and white flowers for hers. She stood by my side in her
identical white dress, and the two of us wed Marcos Avila.
 &HT;    Later, despite his success and the money he was earning, and
after 12 unbroken years with Miami Sound Machine, he decided to
leave the group. ``I've had the fans, the limousines, the Johnny
Carson show,'' he said. ``Now I want a family.''
 &HT;    Marcos opened a public relations agency to offer to
Spanish-language performers the things he had learned while
traveling with Miami Sound Machine.
 &HT;    Once Marcos felt he was on solid ground, he began brainwashing
me to leave Cosmopolitan. My reaction was: Are you crazy?
 &HT;    Marcos, though, convinced me that what I was doing in that
corporation was selling my time instead of my talent.
 &HT;    Take note, all you reading this book, of that important
difference, whatever your situation at the moment.

 By CRISTINA SARALEGUI  
 From ``My Life as a Blonde'' 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Keeping my head above water in the world of television wasn't
easy. First of all I had to shed my old body, face, hair _ my
entire appearance _ along with everything I had grown used to
during the past 20 years af my life.
 &HT;    I had been a writer and magazine editor; I worked at a desk like
a slave. When I took a break, I wolfed down anything I could find
in the vending machines.
 &HT;    Today, when I look at the videos from the first year of ``El
Show de Cristina,'' I'm horrified. I see myself as ridiculous,
strident. I look like a prize pony at auction, draped in scarves,
chains, bracelets, three-tier earrings, everything dangling and
clanking against the microphone.
 &HT;    Eventually we polished my image and paid attention to audience
reaction. I worked really hard to find my own personal style. Now I
keep my hair at shoulder length, and I like my makeup light and
wear simple clothes.
 &HT;    I learned to eat low carbohydrates, low fat, and low sugar and
to eat small quantities of protein every three hours, in order to
maintain a stable energy level to function better all day.
 &HT;    The result was that for the first time, I looked great on
television, and again for the first time in my life, I understood
what it was to be an attractive woman, because when I arrived
somewhere, people turned to look at me even if they didn't know who
I was. That had never happened to me before, and I was 41 years
old!
 &HT;    Another factor about my appearance was that I am fair-skinned,
blonde and blue-eyed.
 &HT;    When the show first aired, letters poured in from my Hispanic
brothers and sisters all across the United States, in which they
wrote that I was ``too white,'' too ``guera'' (the Mexican word for
``blonde'') to represent Hispanics.
 &HT;    Those viewers had to understand that what they were doing to me
was as racist as what Anglos were doing to them. The acceptance
took six months of letters from the public telling me I should wear
more blush!
 &HT;    Once an older woman came up to me and chided, ``Cristina, all
you talk about is sex.''
 &HT;    My response: ``No, senora, I talk about everything! From flying
saucers to breast cancer. You only remember the programs about
sex.''
 &HT;    I air themes on sex because apart from the enormous need for
information on that subject, every time I include a segment on a
sexual topic, the ratings go off the charts, and numbers outweigh
hypocrisy.
 &HT;    Instead of calling a radio station to complain about a program
or writing incensed letters, why not just turn off the set when the
topic comes on? But no_ooo! Just the opposite. More and more sets
are turned on.
 &HT;    It's obvious that many people don't have the least idea what
human sexuality is, and someone must offer them the truth. Their
parents certainly haven't assumed that responsibility, despite the
fact that the duty for the sexual and moral education of our
children rests squarely on us parents.
 &HT;    In June 1992, with ``Cristina'' established as No. 1 in its
category in Spanish-language television, I took a shot at the
coveted crossover into English.
 &HT;    It was simply titled the ``Cristina Show,'' and I was delighted
at the challenge, it goes without saying. But for CBS to hire a
communicator with a Latin accent was nothing short of
revolutionary.
 &HT;    At first there were the usual comparisons, and reporters asked
if I was trying to knock off Oprah. ``Are you kidding?'' I'd ask
jokingly. ``Oprah is like a supersonic transport. I'm a fly
requesting permission to land.''
 &HT;    The concept of the program was to feature topics that
demonstrated the pluralism of U.S. society, emphasizing the
immigrant roots shared by all of us, even the oldest North American
families, whose ancestors also emigrated from other countries.
 &HT;    We chose themes that reflected that concept in all its
ramifications. For example, on one program we called ``White Like
Me,'' several plastic surgeons explained the operations people of
different races _ Asian, African American, or Hispanic _ underwent
to alter their features to make them look ``white.''
 &HT;    We discussed prejudice against black peoples. We presented black
Haitians, immigrants into the United States, who complained that
black Americans discriminated against them because of their
nationality and their accent.
 &HT;    At the end of the 11 weeks, the average ratings augured a nearly
guaranteed success. Some years later, Jonathon Rodgers (president
of the group of CBS stations that gave me the chance to work in
English) explained to us that the program had obtained a higher
average rating than any other beginning program since that time.
 &HT;    But when we began to negotiate, the CBS management offered us a
budget we didn't consider adequate. Just the opposite; the amount
was lower than the current budget of our program in Spanish, when
equivalent formats in English spend two or three times that sum and
more.
 &HT;    So Marcos and I decided not to renew.
 &HT;    What I never understood, though, what I never will understand,
is how it was reported in the trade publications again and again
that our show had failed and that we were canceled because of poor
ratings.
 &HT;    For anyone who may believe that, let me tell you: Ratings in the
United States are public property. If the reporters had verified
the facts, as was their responsibility, they would have realized
that what they were writing was not true.
 &HT;    I had to pay for all that. I'm still paying, in the sense that
every time someone mentions our 1992 venture into the
English-language market, the invariable comment is that we
``failed'' and that we were ``canceled.'' That's still
inconceivable to me.
 &HT;    No one ever told me that a woman looks young until suddenly,
when she approaches the decade between 45 and 55, she runs out of
estrogen and the years suddenly show. Her hands (and her vagina)
begin to dry up, and all you can think about is your little-girl
hands that are gone forever.
 &HT;    Thank God, everything my mother didn't warn me about I found in
a book titled ``Silent Passage'' by Gail Sheehy, which become my
bible. Until I read it, I not only didn't recognize the stage I was
going through in my life but also didn't know what had to do to
survive it and to continue succeeding, without allowing that series
of hurdles to slow down my life.
 &HT;    How do I feel as I approach 50? What am I like in this stage of
my life? Vigorous, curious, sensual, sexual, in good physical
condition, flexible and creative.
 &HT;    I define myself as an adult woman who has struggled very hard to
be able to determine the destiny of her own life. I think that one
can achieve everything she sets out to, although not always all at
once. That is the secret.
 &HT;    I completed a cycle of comfort, of working for 22 years for the
company that formed me professionally. I was I able to have my
children, to stay home, to marry twice, to cook for my parents....
 &HT;    I did all these thing! I completed those cycles.
 &HT;    We're told we can't have everything in life. That's not true! We
can have it all (or enough), as long as we know how to choose. Life
is nothing more than an endless rosary of choices and lessons, one
after the other.

   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Paula Spratt has a husband named Glynn. They're
working stiffs, she says. They bust their buns to support their
kids. One of those kids, a 19-year-old named George, is in school
in Laramie, Wyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's due to graduate Sept. 18,'' Paula Spratt told me, ``to
the tune of $17,500 worth of tuition, and with honors. So, of
course, we've been paying what we can _ his room and board and
giving him money to live on ...
</P>
<P>
   ``So we got a little behind in his room and board. So the
college called and said, `We need the money.' And my husband said,
`Fine, we'll send it to you.' And they said, `When will we receive
it?' And my husband said, `On Tuesday of this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got his paycheck on Friday. He got a personal money order.
He went to the overnight postal facility in Latham (N.Y.) and _ at
9:36 a.m., according to the receipt _ sent it ...''
</P>
<P>
   Glynn Spratt gave the Postal Service a check for $10.75 for
overnight delivery and left relieved that his kid was taken care
of.
</P>
<P>
   Paula told me, ``We'd instructed the college not to yank the kid
out of class ... We gave them six different phone numbers and told
them, `You can reach either one of us at any of these numbers.
Don't bother this kid over finances ...
</P>
<P>
   ``By Tuesday, this kid is trying to leave voice mail messages
all over ... He was hysterical. He was yanked out of class and
told, `You're not going to get a diploma on Sept. 18 unless this is
taken care of ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I bring out the receipt, and all I'm getting from this express
mail BS line is, `We don't know why it wasn't delivered within 24
hours.' I said, `I've got a kid practically wandering the streets
of Laramie, Wyoming, not knowing if he's going to have room, board
or a diploma that he has worked really hard for ...
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting no answers, no answers, no answers. But the part
that burns my butt is that they knew where it was headed. They had
all the times I did on the paperwork. And I said, `What is it with
this guarantee?'
</P>
<P>
   ``It turns out that what they guarantee is the $10.75 back if
they don't deliver on time. That's all they guarantee. So, I said,
`A person's life could be hanging on the line with an overnight
decision and all those fluffy little commercials out there are just
a bunch of nonsense.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It finally got there Wednesday, 3:30 in the afternoon, more
than 48 hours later.''
</P>
<P>
   I found this story intriguing. That's because I have a kid in
school in a little town in Colorado, and I had happen to me
precisely what happened to Paula Spratt. And, like Paula Spratt, I
was badly bent out of shape.
</P>
<P>
   That's when I found out that the U.S. Postal Service really
can't deliver overnight to every location in the country. If you
have the right clerk, somebody who'll bother to dig out a book and
look in it, you'll be told that. I told that to Paula Spratt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a better idea,'' she told me. ``United Parcel
Service.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't tried that,'' I said. ``Did it work?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, baby, did it ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most grownups, Paula Spratt understands that the world in
an imperfect place. She understands that most people really do
their best. Here's what she can't understand, though:
</P>
<P>
   How come, if the Postal Service can't deliver a check within 24
hours, the check she gave them got deposited that very same day?
</P>
<P>
   Because nothing is ever fair, I explained.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, said Paula Spratt.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Organization is important in everyone's life, but for the
elderly it can be the key to how well they can function
independently _ and for how long. They need to simplify their
lives, while keeping their independence and dignity.
 &HT;    However, physical limitations of age or illness, poor memory,
attachment to ``the way things were'' or simply the inability to
ask for help can get in the way.
 &HT;    My mother is 87 years old and in reasonably good health, but she
is not able to do what she used to do. As she says, ``The old gray
mare, she ain't what she used to be.''
 &HT;    Her memory fails her, she can't lift things that are the least
bit heavy and she tires rather quickly. She is in a nice retirement
home, where there are services available, but the staff there
doesn't do everything.
 &HT;    That's where I come in. I am an organizer by profession, and so
I naturally began to help my mother around her home even before she
moved to the retirement home. As things in her apartment began to
be too much for her, we began to simplify her environment.
 &HT;    We went through every room, little by little, several hours at a
time. We sorted through the contents of every closet, shelf and
drawer _ clearing out unused and unwanted items, selling or
throwing away things of no use to anyone or giving usable ``stuff''
to a local charity.
 &HT;    In the kitchen, some of the pots and pans were too heavy for Mom
to lift, even empty. Things stored in very low or high cabinets, or
way in the back of other cabinets, were now impossible to reach.
Since she was no longer giving large dinner parties, many of the
kitchen and dining-room items were no longer needed, although many
held fond memories.
 &HT;    So Mom and I decided to get the family together as we went
through this part of the sorting and simplifying process. We had
many tender moments reminiscing.
 &HT;    The ``good stuff'' was left with Mom, to be fairly divided later
on. And, of course, there were special things that Mom wanted to
give to certain people, and she took care of that. Then we boxed up
dishes and other kitchen items and took them to my house, where we
could all meet and choose what we wanted to keep without putting
Mom through the strain.
 &HT;    Every family will have its own way of sorting and letting go,
but it's important to be sensitive as we try to simplify our
parents' environments to reflect their present lifestyle needs. We
want this to be a positive change, not a trauma.
 &HT;    Most elderly people want to be independent, and the order we can
help bring into their environments helps to keep them functional.
Visibility and accessibility are the watchwords in organizing for
the elderly.
 &HT;    For example, you can replace a crowded jewelry box, where things
are hard to see, by clearing a dresser drawer and putting in lined
trays with small sections for the jewelry. Then everything is
visible upon opening the dresser drawer and that long-forgotten
jewelry can be worn.
 &HT;    In reorganizing cabinets and shelves, use containers that slide
forward easily, and put the things used most often in the most
accessible spaces.
 &HT;    Even though you will be handling many tasks for your parent,
respect his or her wishes. You are the helper, so be sure to resist
the urge to take over. It can happen easily, without your realizing
it _ after all, you are used to ordering your own life _ but it can
be very damaging to your relationship with your parent and to the
success of the simplifying process.
 &HT;    Many people ask for assistance only indirectly, if at all. As
the helping child, you must be even more observant of the parent's
needs in such a case. For example, keep an eye on the parent's
medications to be sure he or she doesn't run out and forget to get
more. If you notice spots or stains on a parent's clothing, offer
to help with the wash or take things to the cleaners.
 &HT;    You might want to compose a shopping list of the items most
regularly used, and make copies of it. Then your parent can simply
check off what is needed. If the shopping is done by others, be
sure to list the particulars: brand names, sizes, where to buy.
 &HT;    All of us have difficulty dealing with the glut of paper in our
lives, and this is increasingly the case as one gets older. For
example, outdated papers and notices can be very confusing to an
elderly person. Managing finances may also become a problem.
 &HT;    In every instance, the first step is the same: Eliminate the
unnecessary.
 &HT;    If your parent doesn't have one already, start a simple portable
filing system with only the most essential papers. Be sure to label
the folders in bold capital letters that will be easy to read. Your
job may be to keep up on the filing and to make sure all the bills
are paid, checkbooks balanced and other financial matters in order.
Be sure that all the unneeded paper is disposed of regularly.
 &HT;    Most organizing tasks can be done with your parent present and
can be a wonderful opportunity to spend meaningful time together.
You can get to know and appreciate one another in new ways.
 &HT;    However, the sessions can deteriorate into constant bickering.
If your parent gets testy, it usually indicates that you have
ignored earlier signs that his or her sense of dignity and pride
has been wounded by the need to be dependent on you.
 &HT;    Keep your eyes and ears sensitive to this natural response, and
you will earn your parent's gratitude and respect. And you will
achieve your goal: to help your parent function independently and
comfortably, for as long as possible.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   You wake abruptly in the middle of the night. Something's wrong:
Your chest hurts, maybe, or you're flushed with sweat.
</P>
<P>
   You're miserable, and adding to the discomfort is your confusion
about how to respond. Should you roll over and rest easy, or should
you call the doctor? And if you need to call, should you do it now
or can you wait until morning?
</P>
<P>
   As you lie in bed, in the still, dark night, a panicky voice
inside may urge you to call an ambulance immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding what to do can be maddening, partly because p.m. pains
often do seem far worse than a.m. aches. After all, there's really
not much else going on right then except what's hurting.
</P>
<P>
   ``At night, awareness of pain and body functions is
heightened,'' says Dr. Jay Siwek, a professor and chairman of
family medicine at Georgetown University Medical Center. ``The
commotion of the day is over, and you're more inclined to focus on
your symptoms.''
</P>
<P>
   While some nighttime problems can be treated at home or ignored,
as you grow older these aches and pains are more likely to be
messages that you need medical attention. The following is a
roundup of late-night health complaints common among people over
50, along with doctors' expert advice on the best ways for you to
respond to trouble.
 &UR; SKIPPED HEARTBEATS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You're lying quietly in bed when you feel your heart miss a
beat. Your pulse may start to race, or you may feel as if it pauses
for a second or two. These are symptoms of arrhythmia, a condition
increasingly common in people over 50.
</P>
<P>
   In women, irregular heart rhythms are especially likely to show
up around the time of menopause, physicians report. Hormonal
changes may be at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you sense a skipped pulse but feel fine otherwise and have
no history of heart disease, generally there's no need to worry,''
says Dr. Hugh Calkins, director of arrhythmia services at Johns
Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   If you exhibit other symptoms, or if an episode is followed by a
chaotic and irregular pulse or involves chest discomfort or
light-headedness, you do need to take action.
</P>
<P>
   The most common cause of sustained rhythm disturbances is a
condition called atrial fibrillation, in which the electrical
cardiac impulse in the upper chamber of the heart become unstable,
resulting in irregular and quivering contractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``While most are not life-threatening in themselves, some
unstable heart rhythms are associated over time with an increased
risk of stroke,'' Calkins says.
</P>
<P>
   What to do: ``Most of the time missed heartbeats aren't
serious,'' says Calkins, ``but you can't always diagnose this
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   If an irregular pulse is accompanied by chest pain or faintness,
go to an emergency room right away or call your physician.
 &UR; CHEST PAIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A heart attack is the first thing most people think of when pain
grips their chest. Yet middle-of-the-night chest pain could be
brought on by a big meal or a snack eaten just before bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   When you lie flat, digestive acid may backtrack up the
esophagus. You might be able to tell the difference between
heartburn and a heart attack this way: A heart attack usually
causes bandlike pressure in the middle of the chest _ a feeling of
fullness or heaviness rather than a sharp pain. The pain may
radiate to either your arm or your jaw, and may be accompanied by
shortness of breath, sweating and/or nausea.
</P>
<P>
   Heartburn, on the other hand, is a burning sensation in the
center of the chest that radiates upward, often into the throat.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to tell the difference: ``Take an antacid, or drink
some milk,'' says Dr. Peter Rubin, a clinical associate professor
of medicine and gastroenterology at the Mount Sinai School of
Medicine in New York City. ``If the pain goes away within a few
minutes, you've diagnosed and temporarily cured heartburn.''
</P>
<P>
   What to do: Head off heartburn by avoiding late-night raids on
the refrigerator. If chest pain persists or comes on with nausea,
sweating, dizziness and/or shortness of breath, it's urgent that
you call your physician, dial 911 or have someone drive you to a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors advise taking an aspirin immediately to dissolve
any possible blood clot. Bring blood-pressure or other medications
with you to the hospital to help the staff assess your needs.
</P>
<P>
   And what if you simply don't feel quite right but don't want to
make a fuss? Not all heart attacks have chest pain as a main
symptom, so self-diagnosis can be tricky. It's better to go to the
hospital or call your doctor than risk misdiagnosing yourself.
 &UR; NIGHT SWEATS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You awaken in the middle of the night, drenched. Among women,
this often results from the hormonal changes of menopause. Ask your
doctor about estrogen-replacement therapy, which can help ease this
and other symptoms as your body adjusts to new hormone levels.
</P>
<P>
   Night bouts of perspiration can also be triggered by pneumonia.
A case of it involving a small percentage of the lung may not be
severe enough to keep you down-and-out during the day _ this is
what's commonly called walking pneumonia. Watch for physical
symptoms like low fever, coughing and chest pain.
</P>
<P>
   There are some less likely causes of troubling night sweats,
including certain medications, a heart attack or heart disease,
lymphoma and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   What to do: If you're often up because of night sweats, or if
they persist for several weeks, see your doctor.
 &UR; TWITCHES AND CRAMPS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You're drifting off to sleep when one of your legs twitches or
your whole body jerks _ and you're awake. Annoying, but normal.
These involuntary movements are known to occur when you shift from
one stage of sleep into another. They are caused by a sudden
electrical discharge within the nerves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no apparent reason for them,'' Siwek says, ``and
since they're not dangerous to you, no preventive measures are
needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a leg cramp or charley horse in your calf muscle that
disrupts your slumber is distressing but generally not a cause for
worry.
</P>
<P>
   What to do: To prevent pesky, painful leg cramps, try this
exercise before bedtime: Sit on the floor with your legs
outstretched. Flex your toes toward your knees, so your calves and
foot muscles are stretched and limbered. Hold for several minutes.
This exercise may also help to relieve a cramp.
 &UR; DIZZINESS AND LIGHT-HEADEDNESS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever rolled over at night and snuggled deep into your
pillow, only to feel as if you're still rolling and the room is
spinning?
</P>
<P>
   ``You may have a problem with inner-ear balance, triggered by a
virus or hereditary factors,'' says Dr. Blackwell Evans, an
associate professor of medicine at the Tulane University Medical
Center in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Call your doctor the following day for a checkup.
</P>
<P>
   Light-headedness when you stand up _ to go to the bathroom, say
_ is caused by a drop in either blood pressure or pulse rate and
can be triggered in several ways. Rising too quickly can cause the
wobbles in people who have low blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, blood-pressure or heart medications, diuretics and
some antidepressants can bring on light-headedness. Check with your
doctor if you take any of these medications and experience
dizziness.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Evans says, be aware that ``stroke is a possibility when
dizziness is also accompanied by a lack of coordination, slurred
speech or numbness of the face. This constellation of symptoms
requires immediate medical attention.''
</P>
<P>
   What to do: Slight light-headedness after standing up from a
reclining or sitting position is probably not cause for alarm. But
vertigo that persists or is accompanied by a lack of coordination
or a numbness of the face requires that you seek immediate medical
attention.

 By EVE GLICKSMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Were you ever at the mall and couldn't remember where you parked
the car? Gotten home from the market and realized you forgot the
milk? And your daughter's anniversary has never slipped your mind
... until this year.
 &HT;    It's so frustrating, and worse, if you're getting on in years,
you worry whether this could be the beginnings of Alzheimer's
disease, the devastating disorder associated with aging and memory
loss.
 &HT;    According to memory experts, though, it's not time to panic.
Most likely, you're suffering from a common condition referred to
as age-associated memory impairment, or ``benign forgetfulness.''
And with a little strategy and perseverance, you can even learn how
to compensate for it. Relax, you're not losing your mind!
 &HT;    Who said it's all downhill from here? Contrary to what was once
thought, senility is not inevitable as times passes. Twenty percent
of mature adults experience no discernible drop in their mental
faculties.
 &HT;    Researchers, in fact, have found that poor memory in mature
adults can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. That is, if you believe
your memory gets worse when you get older, you give up more easily.
 &HT;    In China, where there are no stereotypes about age and mental
decline, seniors performed much better on tests than same-aged
Americans.
 &HT;    But age can take a toll, and IQ has nothing to do with it. The
first sign is slower recall and more difficulty learning new
things, says geriatric psychiatrist Dr. Gary Gottlieb, director and
chief executive officer of Friends Hospital in Philadelphia. Your
ability to memorize an address given to you in a distracting
environment like a party may drop off. Or you may need to pause a
few seconds to come up with the name of the movie you saw last
night.
 &HT;    You may start to notice the changes in your 30s, but it's
generally not significant until you're 60, Gottlieb notes. And what
is normal may surprise you: In a national study on memory loss by
the Charles A. Dana Foundation, nearly half of 45-year-olds
surveyed said they had problems recalling names.
 &HT;    There are actually three types of memory, each influenced
differently by age, explains Dr. Milton Alter, clinical professor
of neurology at Allegheny University of the Health Sciences in
Philadelphia.
 &HT;    Long-term memory enables you to remember things about your best
friend in grade school and is the least affected by advancing
years. Intermediate memory _ say, remembering an appointment _ may
wane a little more over time.
 &HT;    Most vulnerable to age is short-term memory, says Dr. Alter, a
neuroepidemiologist. This is why you may be flabbergasted to find
you can't remember something you were discussing 10 minutes ago.
 &HT;    To understand how memory works, think about it as a three-step
process. First, you receive the information; then, you store it;
eventually, you retrieve it.
 &HT;    Memory loss can occur at the first step, for instance, if you
weren't concentrating when someone was telling you something. While
it's true that we lose upward of 50,000 brain cellS a day (eek!)
and that our brains peak in young adulthood, it's the way we encode
and retrieve information _ steps two and three _ that cause most
memory lapses in the elderly, says Dr. Thomas Swirsky-Sachetti, a
neuropsychologist and associate professor at Jefferson Medical
College in Philadelphia.
 &HT;    ``In your younger days, you could just let that grocery list
wash over you one time without thinking. Older people have to be
more active and conscious about encoding the information in their
brains,'' says Swirsky-Sachetti.
 &HT;    Mature adults, he explains, must develop strategies to file
their thoughts so they are easier to retrieve. Because their minds
have accumulated so much information over the years, their memory
banks are difficult to sort through and access otherwise.
Visualization, associations and written reminders may do the trick.
 &HT;    Nor is it always age. Medical problems can affect your memory,
too. Psychological stress such as grief or fatigue, substance
abuse, vitamin deficiencies or illnesses from thyroid disease to
infections can all interfere with remembering.
 &HT;    More startling, 15 to 20 percent of memory problems in the
elderly are caused or worsened by medications they are taking,
Gottlieb says.
 &HT;    Even your mood can cause forgetfulness. Depression is
responsible for 10 percent of memory complaints in those over 65,
says Swirsky-Sacchetti, who does testing of memory and other
cognitive functions. Anxiety _ having a lot on your mind _ also
hampers memory, he adds.
 &HT;    If you're worried about your memory or that of someone close to
you, talk to your primary care physician first, Gottlieb says. If
needed, your doctor can refer you to a specialist who can perform a
complete evaluation that would include a physical exam, personal
interview and screening tests that measure a range of cognitive
skills, including concentration and orientation.
 &HT;    If you're under age 75, the chances are you don't have
Alzheimer's or clementia. In these diseases, memory loss is usually
accompanied by other problems, such as speaking difficulty,
disorientation or a sudden inability to perform familiar tasks.
 &HT;    Another tip-off: Over a period of six months, the person with
dementia or Alzheimer's will show a progressive decline, as opposed
to the spotty defects of someone with normal memory loss, Alter
says.
 &HT;    Much like muscles that grow flabby if not exercised, your memory
requires daily toning. Some researchers speculate that memory loss
blamed on physical aging may be an offshoot of retirement when
mental activity can fall off. The golden rule of memory is ``use it
or lose it.''
 &HT;    ``Remain active in tasks that require thinking _ travel,
discussion groups, museum-going, concerts, reading, socializing and
new opportunities,'' Alter recommends. Consider that your abstract
abilities and vocabulary can improve well into your senior years
with continued learning.
 &HT;    You can even have fun while tuning up your memory. Many find
that playing cards, doing crosswords or taking interesting classes
works for them. Regular physical exercise that improves circulation
_ how about dancing? _ can sharpen the brain's performance as well.
 &HT;    Try to lay off optional medications, too. To get to sleep, try
listening to music or reading instead of taking sleeping pills that
can cloud memory, Alter suggests.
 &HT;    ``Sleeping pills, relaxants, anti-anxiety medications and
moderate amounts of alcohol all can interfere with alertness
because the mature person's tolerance to them is reduced,'' he
says.
 &HT;    Think of practicing the memory strategies listed below as the
equivalent of wearing glasses for failing eyes. It's no shame, and
a small effort to make for being able to find those darn keys!
 -0- 
 SIDEBAR: IMPROVING RECALL  
 &HT;    Recalling names: Conjure up a mental picture or association to
remember names. Repeat the name in conversation and ask how to
spell it.
 &HT;    Absent-mindedness: Block out distractions. When you run upstairs
to get your checkbook, think about nothing else until the item is
in your hand. If you're interrupted, cue yourself by turning a
watch or ring inward as a reminder that you were in the middle of
doing something.
 &HT;    On the tip of your tongue: Anxiety is a mental block, which is
why wracking your brain for a word usually doesn't work. The
thought will likely pop into your head later when the mind has more
time to scan its reserves. Sometimes, running through letters in
the alphabet can trigger the sound of the word you're searching
for.
 &HT;    Losing things: Select a permanent place for frequently misplaced
items such as keys. Say out loud for reinforcement, ``I'm leaving
the keys on the hallway table.'' To find a missing item, retrace
your steps and recall as many details as possible. One recollection
can trigger others.
 &HT;    Where's the car?: Before you walk away from your parked car,
pretend that your mind is a camera and record a snapshot
perspective of your car's location. At the mall, be attentive to
landmarks such as banners or storefronts. Better yet, try parking
in the same area each time.

 By ANN ORR  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Seventy-five-year-old Rollie Howes never figured he'd have any
use for computers, much less the Internet. But thanks to some
persistent arm-twisting by his nephew, he borrowed a laptop
computer and took the plunge.
 &HT;    Within 24 hours, Howes went from techno-novice to dedicated Web
surfer. The clincher was when he was able to locate long-lost
photos of the submarine he served on in World War II.
 &HT;    Howes is in good company on the Net, with more and more seniors
going online every day. Retired Rutgers professor Isabel Wolock
used the Internet to book a vacation villa in Spain and keeps up
with book, movie and theater reviews by visiting the New York Times
Web site.
 &HT;    Sixty-one-year-old auto executive John Grettenberger uses
America Online's Personal Finance Channel to track his investments
and frequents the Mayo Clinic's site for the latest information on
health-related issues.
 &HT;    There's something for everyone on the Net, whether you're 7 or
70. For seniors who have never touched a computer, how to get
started is the biggest concern _ and, indeed, getting hooked up is
the greatest challenge of the whole online experience.
 &HT;    Perhaps the best way to begin is with the help of a friend who's
already computer-savvy. If technology-minded friends are in short
supply, there's a terrific paperback book, ``Young   Heart,
Computing for Seniors'' (McGraw-Hill, 1996, $22.95), that tells you
all you need to know to successfully use a computer and hook up to
the Internet.
 &HT;    Classes in computer use and the Internet, offered by public
libraries and community colleges, are another popular and
affordable way in which people of all ages can get started.
 &HT;    Once you're online, the choices of interesting things to do are
endless. E-mail is particularly useful; it's a great way to stay in
touch with friends and the grandchildren. You can even send them
animated, talking greeting cards.
 &HT;    A growing number of quality Web sites are being created
especially for older computer users. In addition to news, feature
articles and advice, many have ``chat rooms'' or bulletin boards
where visitors can gather to ``talk'' and exchange information.
 &HT;    On the Internet you'll find information on virtually any topic,
including health, nutrition, travel, finance and various leisure
activities.
 &HT;    Get connected, and check out these great Web sites:
 STARTER SITES  
 &HT;    + SeniorCom (www.Senior.com). Want to check out retirement
communities without leaving your house? How about chat with others
or find out what events and classes are scheduled in your area? You
can do all this and more at this informative site. Best of all,
there are hundreds of links to other useful Web sites focusing on
travel, health and wellness, social security, services for the
aging and more.
 &HT;    + The American Association of Retired Persons (www.aarp.org).
Here's the place to find out where the AARP stands on issues of
importance to seniors. There's also a wealth of information on such
topics as health and aging, money management, wills and living
trusts, and grandparents raising grandchildren. AARP members can
get discounts on car rentals, hotels, airlines and even online
services (800-424-3410).
 &HT;    + SeniorNet (www.SeniorNet.com). This nonprofit organization's
site offers chat rooms and discussions on politics, travel,
gardening and health, with links to senior organizations and

 By JERE DANIEL  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It was a gray November day when my wife and I drove up to her
83-year-old mother's home in suburban New York. As we trudged up
the crumbling front steps, we stopped, stared and asked each other
the same question: ``How will she make it through another winter?
Who's going to shovel the driveway when it snows? And who'll fix
these steps?''
 &HT;    On our next visit, my wife summoned up the courage to ask her
iron-willed mother, Fay, whether she didn't think it was time to
consider living someplace else.
 &HT;    Remembering the previous year's Siberian winter, Fay hesitated.
Finally she asked, ``But where would I go?''
 &HT;    It took many months of searching to answer that question, but we
eventually learned that there is a large and growing range of
housing options for the elderly _ be they able-bodied or in need of
regular medical care _ all of them tailored to preserve what older
people want most: their independence.
 &HT;    The best solution for my mother-in-law proved to be a co-op
apartment in a building that has a ``buddy system'' whereby
residents look after one another. The building is located in the
same town she has always lived in, but in an area that has stores
and apartment buildings that have attracted many of its older
residents.
 &HT;    Here are some other elder housing choices that we considered.
 HOME-SHARING  
 &HT;    Sharing living space with a roommate is perhaps the simplest and
most underused way for an elderly person to alleviate loneliness
and strained finances. The practice is becoming increasingly
popular, however, especially with women over the age of 65, says
Jon Pynoos, director of the National Resource and Policy Center on
Housing and Long-Term Care at the University of Southern California
in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    Home-sharing may mean simply renting out a vacant room, or it
may involve modifying one's home to turn unused space into living
quarters.
 &HT;    The National Shared Housing Resource Center in Baltimore is a
nonprofit agency that screens and matches those who need a home
with those who wish to share theirs, making home-sharing safe and
systematic. The center works through 350 local affiliates and has
made thousands of matches, says its director, Mark Benson.
 &HT;    ``We also provide publications and technical assistance for
those who want to convert and finance homes for sharing,'' he adds.
 COOPERATIVE LIVING  
 &HT;    Communes _ communities where people share work and
responsibilities for each other, and live in commonly owned housing
on commonly owned land _ exist throughout the country and are
actually on the increase. Most of them are intergenerational, that
is, filled with people of every age, a factor that makes them
especially attractive to older people.
 &HT;    A new variation of the traditional commune is called cohousing.
In these newer style communes, residents still co-own the land and
benefit from central services such as meals and recreation, but
live in individually owned homes on the property.
 &HT;    Cohousing communities are often started from scratch. People
bent on creating a community purchase land together, then build
homes and a large community house. They govern their community
democratically, often sharing social activities, meals, child care
and maintenance equipment such as trucks, snow plows and
lawnmowers.
 ECHO HOUSING  
 &HT;    ECHO houses are attractive compact homes, fully equipped and
often all or partially prefabricated, that are placed next to a
parent house _ frequently that of a grown childfrom which they
typically draw utilities and water.
 &HT;    In Australia, where they originated, they are called granny
flats; grandchildren can drop in several times during the day for
cookies and milk, and grown sons and daughters can keep a watchful,
caring eye on their parents.
 &HT;    ECHO houses (an acronym for Elder Cottage Housing Opportunities)
are sometimes subsidized by community social service agencies. Or
they may be purchased for $26,000 to $36,000. When the ECHO house
is no longer needed, it can be resold, moved and hooked up at
another site.
 CONGREGATE HOUSING  
 &HT;    Congregate housing typically consists of 20 or 30 small living
units (each with bedroom, bath and sometimes cooking facilities) in
one building or in a group of buildings joined to a hub facility
that provides meals and social activities.
 &HT;    While congregate communities are primarily for ambulatory
seniors, most such facilities do have an on-site supervisor for
safety and security, and ready access to local health services for
routine medical care and emergencies.
 &HT;    Congregate housing is often sponsored by social, religious,
fraternal or community agencies.
 ASSISTED LIVING  
 &HT;    Essentially, assisted living is a residence for the mentally
and/or physically frail who do not quite need the full care of a
nursing home but do need some personal care and supervision
available around the clock.
 &HT;    Some candidates for assisted living may suffer frequent
confusion and bouts of forgetfulness and need help with daily
routines. Residents receive their meals, assistance with
medications, grooming and other personal care according to their
individual needs, limited health-care services, supervision and
companionship.
 &HT;    Assisted-living residences _ which typically feel more homey
than institutional _ are usually for-profit businesses.
 &HT;    Whitney Redding, spokeswoman for the Assisted Living Federation
of America, a trade organization based in Fairfax, Va., says,
``What makes assisted living unique is its philosophy of promoting
independence and dignity for residents in a comfortable, homelike
setting.''
 CONTINUING CARE  
 &HT;    Continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs) may consist of a
single building or a whole village serving 500 residents.
 &HT;    CCRCs accommodate everyone from the totally independent to the
completely incapacitated in units ranging from small houses and
apartments to full-fledged nursing homes. They provide a lifetime
continuum of housing and health care. Residents move from level to
level as their health changes.
 &HT;    While some facilities are sponsored by community, religious or
fraternal organizations, a growing number are run by commercial
interests such as hotel chains and insurance companies. Residents
pay monthly fees starting at about $2,000, which guarantees them
the care they need.
 &HT;    At the luxury end of continuing-care retirement communities,
residents pay a substantial entry fee _ of several hundred thousand
dollars _ and purchase the guarantee of care for the rest of their
lives in plush accommodations. They get all home maintenance,
recreation and nursing care for as long as they need it, paying
monthly fees of anywhere from $750 to several thousand dollars.
 &HT;    CCRC payment arrangements vary from facility to facility. Be
sure never to sign a contract without checking its provisions _ and
the sponsor's financial stability _ with a lawyer.
 &HT;    The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) and the
American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging (AAHSA)
offer guides spelling out such precautions.
 &HT;    A personal visit is essential before selecting any elder living
arrangement. The AARP and AAHSA can provide you with a checklist to
help you evaluate a facility. Observe the staff for its competence
and friendliness; rate both the living quarters and health-care
services.
 &HT;    Remember that if you are selecting a new home for an elderly
parent or other relative, you should be as critical as you would be
for yourself.

SIMPSON CREATOR LOOKS TO NEW SERIES

 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Without ``The Simpsons,'' many evoted fans would indeed find the
TV world a wasteland.
 &HT;    The funniest, hippest, most irreverent series on the box is
entering its 10th season, making it the longest-running comedy
series and the longest-running animated series in TV history.
 &HT;    It's shown in over 70 countries and the top names in Hollywood
and sports, from Bette Midler to Magic Johnson, line up to do
voice-over appearances in the lives of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and
Maggie.
 &HT;    Now ``Simpsons'' creator Matt Groening (his last name rhymes
with complaining) has come up with a new animated show premiering
on Fox early in 1999 _ a science-fiction offering called
``Futurama.''
 &HT;    ``It comes from having grown up reading science fiction,''
Groening explains. ``My older brother Mark had a huge collection of
books and magazines and I loved those covers. I thought it would be
really neat to take some of the conventions of science fiction and
have fun with them in a 'Simpsons'-style way.''
 &HT;    Groening is visible in any Hollywood crowd. He's the one who
looks like a computer nerd, maybe the last man in Hollywood who
believes it's more important to tone your funny bone than your abs.
 &HT;    On this day he's wearing a down-home Western shirt buttoned up
to the neck, well-worn cowboy boots and uncool green pants.
 &HT;    While the folks in ``Futurama'' are obviously descendants of the
Simpson family, they are more than just Homer and Marge in
spacesuits, says Groening. ``The characters have big eyeballs and
overbites a la 'Simpsons.' However, it's not a 'Simpsons'
spinoff,'' he says. ``The Simpsons live in this fictional town with
the equivalent of a Dairy Queen and a Denny's. On 'Futurama' it's
the same thing but we're doing the whole universe. And so it
requires a bit more planning, which is why it took three years to
put this thing together.''
 &HT;    Groening hopes his characters will become as beloved (if that's
the word for Bart and his crew) as the Simpsons. For him they're
already like family:
 &HT;    ``The three main characters are Fry, a guy from our time who
gets frozen on New Year's Eve, 1999 and wakes up a thousand years
in the future.
 &HT;    ``Female interest is added with the lovely Leela who has one eye
in the middle of her forehead but that doesn't mean she's not a
babe.
 &HT;    ``Then there's Bender. He's our robotic Homer. He's just lovably
corrupt a la Homer. Loves his vices. I think he's the first robot
in science fiction who shoplifts.''
 &HT;    Although he deals with the likes of Fox boss Rupert Murdoch (who
will do a guest spot in the new ``Simpson'' season), Groening comes
from the manic world of comics, where he's still most comfortable.
He was virtually unknown beyond that little milieu until his ``Life
in Hell'' strip debuted in 1977. It runs in 250 newspapers world
wide.
 &HT;    The comic strip led to ``Life in Hell'' books which lead to the
Simpsons, who first appeared on Fox as part of ``The Tracey Ullman
Show,'' and jetted Groening into quite another league.
 &HT;    Despite his success, he still lives more like an artist than a
Hollywood tycoon, in a house in the upscale bohemian precincts of
the canals of Venice, Calif., with his wife Deborah and his two
small sons, Homer and Abraham.
 &HT;    ``Futurama'' takes place a thousand years from now and the way
the Simpsons are going they might still be around then. ``I don't
know how long 'The Simpsons' will run,'' Groening laughs. ``It's
surprised me that it's gone on this long. But I love the show and I
want us to go out on top. I want to go out doing great shows.''
 &HT;    Not that there's been any falling off in the Simpson's quality
over the years. ``The coming season,'' Groening insists, ``is as
good as any we've ever done or better. We've got a bunch of new
writers now who tell me they grew up watching the show. They're
creating original stories that not only don't repeat what we've
done before they also don't repeat anything I've seen on
television.''
 &HT;    He reads a synopsis of a forthcoming episode: ``Keeping a secret
proves difficult for Homer when he lands a personal-assistant job
working for Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.''
 &HT;    Does Groening worry that ``Futurama'' may pale by comparison
with ``The Simpsons''?. ``I think we'll deliver the goods,'' he
says. ``On 'Futurama' we have the luxury of looking back at the
whole history of 'The Simpsons' and picking out what worked and
trying some of that and some new stuff.''
 &HT;    He will also, he says, try for the something-for-everybody humor
that distinguishes ``The Simpsons'' from other TV comedies. ``Most
TV shows don't reward you for paying attention,'' he says. ``But on
'The Simpsons' if you really do that there's stuff hidden in the
backgrounds. I love the idea that we put in jokes the kids don't
get.''

 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the war of Robert E. Lee and Ulysses S. Grant, of
Stonewall Jackson and George McClellan. Slavery was an issue that
divided the country. It radically changed the United States, a
nation coming of age in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   And it occurred more than a decade before the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-Mexican War of 1846-48 is not in the forefront of U.S.
historical consciousness (although it is one of the defining
moments of Mexican history). But the war, the result of the U.S.
policy of ``Manifest Destiny,'' made the country a bi-coastal
nation, adding more than a half-million square miles as Mexico lost
what is today California, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah and parts of
Colorado, Wyoming and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S.-Mexican War: 1846-48,'' a two-part, four-hour documentary
(9-11 p.m. EDT Sunday and Monday, check local listings), is one of
two notable documentaries to air in the coming days on PBS. The
other is a ``Family Name,'' (10-11:30 p.m. EDT Tuesday, check local
listings) the story of a white Southerner's quest to prove the
links between whites and blacks who share his surname, Alston.
</P>
<P>
   Both documentaries are worth your time before you get lost in
the sea of network season premieres. If the two presentations share
a common thread, it is that both pose questions previously unasked.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican War documentary is told over four hours and it's
just a bit too long. Because photographs of the time were limited
to portraits (unlike ``Civil War,'' which was able to make
brilliant use of photography), ``U.S.-Mexican War'' relies heavily
on paintings, re-enactments, letters and video of existing
buildings and landscape of the era.
</P>
<P>
   It creates a vibrant, colorful picture of a forgotten war that
forged a transcontinental power, giving the Unite States
cross-country trails and deep-water Pacific Ocean ports. Told from
both sides, it does not shy away from the fact America was the
aggressor in the conflict Mexico did not want to pursue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mexican War really occupied the entire effort of the
United States during the two years it went on,'' Gen. John S.D.
Eisenhower (Ret.), a military historian and son of the late
president (the resemblance is startling), said at a summer
gathering of television critics. ``It faded because it was
overshadowed by the Civil War.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1840s, Texas _ which declared independence from
Mexico the previous decade _ agreed to be annexed by the United
States. Mexico considered the absorption an act of aggression,
especially when U.S. troops crossed a disputed boundary. When
Mexico refused to sell northern provinces sought by the United
States, a stand-off of armies ensued, leading to inevitable
confrontation and ultimately war.
</P>
<P>
   The war was popular in the South, but many Northerners were
concerned the expansion would also lead to the addition of slave
states. Many of the top generals of the Civil War honed their
bloody craft in battles on present-day American and Mexican soil.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the United States was able to purchase the land it
sought. The war is remembered in Mexico as an honorable fight
against imperialism. While still recalled in part of the United
States, it is possibly the most underrated war in the nation's
history.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _____ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Family Name,'' which was released commercially in 1997 to rave
reviews, opens with filmmaker Macky Alston asking a simple but
poignant question: ``Is something a secret if everybody knows it,
but nobody talks about it?''
</P>
<P>
   Alston could have been talking about his own homosexuality,
which he closeted for years. Instead, he was speaking about his
ancestors' link to slavery in North Carolina, and whether he could
in fact be related to some of his hometown's black residents.
</P>
<P>
   Alston soon discovers the Alstons were one of the largest
slave-owning families in North Carolina. He then sets out to
retrace the lineage of whites and blacks with the name, attempting
to determine if and where the paths cross. He succeeds, but still
is left with more questions than answers.
</P>
<P>
   As the filmmaker probes for white guilt and black resentment
regarding the legacy of slavery, he is at first surprised to find
none. He realizes the reason is the issue was never contemplated
in-depth before.
</P>
<P>
   Alston's search takes him from North Carolina to Philadelphia to
New York and back, with stops at courthouses and old porches and
regal living rooms. Near the end white and black Alstons _ who
previously held family reunions a week and few miles apart without
knowledge of one another _ gather for a concert outside a former
plantation as a result of his inquiries.
</P>

THE HOME RUN _ ONE OF LIFE'S RARE, PERFECTLY COMPLETE ACTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For most of this strange baseball season _ a year of diluted
pitching talent and a juiced ball _ the race to break Roger Maris's
37-year-old single-season home run record hypnotized fans and
casual observers alike. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the now-successful, muscle-enhanced Mark McGwire plus Sammy
Sosa, Ken Griffey Jr. and others have clobbered the poor ball,
launching it on a few trips that still may not have ended, I've
been trying to understand why the homer _ the round-tripper, the
four-bagger, the tater, the jack _ has always engaged our hearts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Finally I have figured it out. It's because the home run is one
of life's rare, perfectly complete acts. In an oddly
self-referential way, the home run fulfills itself. It is whole,
exhaustive, unabridged. It is comprehensive and, thus, cannot be
added to. It can only be celebrated. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is, beyond that, an individual act cocooned within the
context of a team game. And yet even when it accounts for the only
run in a 17-1 drubbing, say, it is never meaningless. Its swift
beauty and awesome irrevocability give it a sweetness, a ripeness,
a finality _ a prime-numberness, if you will _ that refuses to be
discounted. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There simply are not many events in life that can compare with
the wholeness, the completed essence of a home run. It is
baseball's equivalent of golf's hole-in-one, of football's 100-yard
kickoff return, of marriage's simultaneously achieved sexual
orgasm. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What can people say after such consummate fulfillments except
``Wow!''? And often even that should be withheld in favor of the
respect shown by simple silence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We spend much of our lives seeking experiences as full and
autonomous as the home run but find ourselves settling much more
often for the equivalent of base hits, ground-rule doubles or
birdies. Yet all the while we know intuitively how lovely it would
be to go deep, to pound one out of the park. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one reason the home run so appeals to our sense of
completeness is that we both start and finish at _ where else? _
home. And what is home sweet home if not where, in the end, we
belong? What is home if not where the heart is? If not our castle?
If not the place where, as Robert Frost said, when you go there,
they have to take you in? If not the place it took a heap o' livin'
to make? If not the place, be it ever so humble, there's no other
place like? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And how, in baseball, do we get back to home once we've left
after a home run swing? Why, we circle _ ah, circle _ the bases.
And what's a circle _ even on a diamond _ if not a perfect shape?
What is a circle if not, as Ralph Waldo Emerson called it, ``the
highest emblem in the cipher of the world''? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even when we cannot understand the whole of which we may be a
part, a circle is a sacramental sign of the very fullness we seek.
It is why, in Christian theological insignia, the Trinity often is
represented by three intersecting circles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And the home run _ which, in fact, the runner does not complete
by following the hard right angles of the base paths but, rather,
by softly rounding those angles into something like a circle _
contains within itself enough meaning to stand alone, even if, in
the context of a game, its adjacent team meaning is unclear. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is true, of course, that the home run has become so common in
the big leagues that even ninth-place hitters now tag a dozen or
more per season. That murderous year when Babe Ruth hit 60 homers
in 1927, his regular teammates contributed only 91 more, and Lou
Gehrig had 47 of those. In the World Series that year Ruth had the
only two homers hit by either team. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But however routine the home run has become, nothing can alter
the finished nature of it. And as people who often are fragmented,
distracted and unfulfilled, it is precisely that completeness for
which we yearn. And for which, in this remarkably charming season,
we cheer and cheer. &QL;
</P>

`SIMON BIRCH' IS A MAJOR SOBFEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three words of advice for anyone who plans on seeing ``Simon
Birch'': Invest in tissues.
</P>
<P>
   Two or three crates should do. You can purchase them in bulk at
most large supermarkets. Do be sure to stock up, however, because
only massive quantities of Kleenex will get you through this
skillfully and enjoyably eccentric tearjerker, a variation on John
Irving's ``A Prayer for Owen Meany'' that wrings big salt tears
from a pointedly quirky premise.
</P>
<P>
   Moviegoers who recoil from tearjerkers will probably loathe this
one. But folks in the mood for a bit of smart _ and, let's be
honest, frequently delightful _ narrative manipulation will respond
to the unabashed emotion in director Mark Steven Johnson's
off-balance fable about a small, bright boy with extraordinary
faith in God. Few films address issues of prayer and human destiny
with such humor, sincerity or brazen sentimentality; few are filled
with such emphatic (and persuasively written) blubber. The most
lachrymose moments in Johnson's script are as subtle as 12-foot
placards: ``CRY NOW,'' they blare. And we do. Heavily. On demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simon Birch'' will remind the willing viewer of many things _
``Terms of Endearment'' in its mix of tears and laughter, ``Forrest
Gump'' in its exalting portrait of a disabled protagonist _ but
it's like nothing so much as a lost episode of ``The Wonder
Years,'' that old salt-and-sugar ABC drama that tracked the
emotional zigs and zags of an articulate 12-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simon'' is both weepier and weirder, but the overall gestalt
is prime-time television: It promises to yank our emotions, and it
does.
</P>
<P>
   From the film's opening voice-over, delivered by Jim Carrey in
his very-serious-grown-up mode, we know three things: That Simon
Birch dies. That Simon Birch kills his best friend's mother. And
that Simon Birch, a tiny boy ``with a wrecked voice'' whose story
is about to unfold, is a carrier of divine grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the reason that I believe in God,'' says Carrey, playing
the adult version of Simon's boyhood pal. ``What faith I have I owe
to Simon Birch.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a big subject for a little movie, but Johnson turns it
around with engaging brio _ somehow, the whole thing manages to be
both obviously contrived and splendidly entertaining. The film's
greatest asset by far is its star, the 3-foot-1-inch Ian Michael
Smith, a knock-out young actor with a natural, spiky charisma.
</P>
<P>
   Smith wears distracting coke-bottle spectacles through most of
the film, but when he takes them off, his childish beauty is
breathtaking: He really is an angel masquerading as an 11-year-old.
That, combined with his deadpan spin on bristly dialogue, gives the
movie a delightful, winking impishness.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do coffee and doughnuts have to do with God?'' he asks,
interrupting the august Reverend Russell (David Strathairn,
starched to the eyebrows) during Sunday services. ``Whoever said
that church needs a continental breakfast?'' Good questions.
</P>
<P>
   Simon asks a lot of them, to the amazed horror of most everyone
who knows him. The boy believes that he's an instrument of God _ he
believes that God made him small for a reason _ and he believes
that someday, exercising some divine plan, he's going to be a hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep waiting for God to give me a sign,'' he says, ``like
the burning bush and the Ten Commandments _ but I guess He doesn't
go in for that kind of thing anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of skeptics in Simon's world, his best friend
included. Joe (Joseph Mazzello of ``Shadowlands,'' again playing a
boy who loses his mother) is the illegitimate son of the town's
scarlet woman (Ashley Judd, exuding warmth). He has no idea who his
dad is, but with Simon's help, he's determined to find out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're already a bastard,'' Simon advises his friend. ``You
might as well be an enlightened one.''
</P>
<P>
   The credits say the movie was ``suggested'' by Irving's novel,
but neither the careful word choice nor the title change means that
Irving divorced himself from the project. It simply means that he
declined to give permission for the character names and title when
he sold the rights to Disney for a reported $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The film's main departures from the book are its new ending and
its focus on one year in Simon's life, which liberates the movie
from having to follow him into adulthood (and find a new actor to
play him).
</P>
<P>
   And things work well as they are. The film is neatly acted, by
everyone: Oliver Platt, as the wise oddball who woos Joe's mom,
fills a romantic character part with dimpled ease. In fact, the
movie's only major drawback _ its most cloying, rip-your-hair-out
flaw _ is its slush-heavy score, penned by Marc Shaiman
(``Sleepless in Seattle,'' ``The American President'') with a
grievous lack of understatement.
</P>
<P>
   The film is sobful enough without it; when the score kicks in,
it comes mortally close to drowning in saline. Good thing the
unsinkable Simon Birch is manning the boat, keeping his and
everyone's head above water.

 By JACKIE RUBENSTEIN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    I am sitting in a room with at least 18 other women, all of us
in standard issue gowns. We are of varying ages, ethnicity, and
economic standing. We are in varying states of dismay, fear and
apprehension. We are here because of our breasts.
 &HT;    This is my first mammogram. Some irregularities noted while
nursing my baby have prompted my visit, making me, nearing 40, one
of the youngest women in the room. Soon, another woman who looks
about my age comes in and sits next to me, acknowledging me with
worried eyes _ only a problem would have brought us here before the
recommended time.
 &HT;    All of us here have our stories _ if not our body's own, than
that of a close friend, sister, mother, aunt, cousin, friend of
friend, mother of friend. Someone who has found a lump or been told
of a spot, and who has had to enter the world we all now fear to do
battle, endure, survive _ or not. Regardless of our ages or reasons
for being here, it is impossible not to be nervous.
 &HT;    We sit, for the most part, silently, thumbing distractedly
through magazines, watching the parade of womanhood pass in and out
of the various rooms. One group of older women has clearly come
together, strength in numbers. They have brought their knitting and
sit companionably around a table, chatting and counting stitches,
losing track as one or the other of them is brought in for an exam
or consultation.
 &HT;    As we take our turns at the machine (this will only hurt for a
second, dear, a bit of pressure is all) and come back to wait for
our results, we note who goes in before and after us _ each of us
tracking our potential for bad news by the order and flow of our
companions. As name after name is called, the woman next to me and
I exchange glances more frequently, certain at last that many who
were examined after us have been given leave to go.
 &HT;    ``This is how my mother found out,'' she confides, finally.
``Everyone else was coming and going, but they needed to take more
time with her.''
 &HT;    ``Maybe our charts are just in a pile that hasn't been picked up
yet,''I offer inanely, trying to stem the panic that is rising in
us both.
 &HT;    We are silent again, and I pull my robe closer around me,
feeling the protrusions that have brought me here. They have marked
other stages of my life _ their small size the bane of my
adolescence, their sudden growth the first sign of my pregnancy,
their ability to produce nourishment for my baby an endless wonder.
 &HT;    Finally, I am called in and receive good news _ the
irregularities are nothing more than that, unremarkable changes
that can occur with pregnancy and nursing. I come out with a smile
and am greeted with a thumbs-up from my acquaintance.
 &HT;    ``Walk right on out of here,'' she says. ``Don't stop.''
 &HT;    I start to follow her advice but find I cannot leave without
her. We have not even exchanged names, and, if her news is bad, she
may not want or find comfort in a stranger's presence. But still I
linger in the dressing room, making small adjustments, peeking into
the waiting room, until I see her being summoned. When she comes
out, her face is awash in relief _ her mother's fate not yet, if
ever, her own.
 &HT;    She is at first surprised to find me waiting for her, but then
we self-consciously laugh and grasp hands tightly in understanding.
In a week, or a month, we won't recognize each other on the street.
But today, in this place, there is a truth we both know: We are all
in this together.

 &HT;    LAWYERLY AUTHOR BROUGHT IN TO HELP WRITE STARR REPORT
 &HT;    Eds: Updating for all needing and repeating in (w) Washington
and (l) lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To help write the investigative report to Congress
that the world is finally reading, Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr turned to a soft-spoken literary lawyer who shares his
small-town Texas roots.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the hard-bitten career prosecutors who make up most of
the team that has investigated President Clinton for four years,
Stephen Bates was recruited as much for his talents as a scholarly
wordsmith as for his legal skills as a Harvard-educated attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The author of several non-fiction books and an editor of the
Wilson Quarterly, a serious cultural journal, Bates was among the
principal writers of the a massive document that includes explicit
details about Clinton's sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky in
making a case for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very well qualified,'' said Lynn Chu, a New York literary
agent who represents Bates, as well as Starr and House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga. ``He's a terrific lawyer and a really good
writer.''
</P>
<P>
   At 40, Bates is about a decade younger than his boss, but they
have similar backgrounds. While Starr grew up in the tiny Texas
town of Vernon, Bates was reared in Pecos, a dusty agricultural
community of 12,000 souls about 200 miles east of El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what propelled his son from the West Texas prairie to the
nation's capital, Bob Bates declared, ``sheer talent.'' But that's
about all the friendly fertilizer dealer would allow. His son has
asked his family not to talk to reporters, the elder Bates
explained, lest they unwittingly provide ammunition to the ``White
House attack dogs'' eager to discredit Starr's investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a low-profile type anyway,'' Bob Bates said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Stephen Bates did not return phone calls or reply to
e-mail seeking information for this story.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very soft-spoken. Middle of the road politically. Really
smart,'' said Chu. ``He's not going to make any mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The prose about Clinton stretches over 400 pages. Along with the
charges of perjury, abuse of power and obstruction of justice, it
includes embarrassing details of Clinton's sexual relationship with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In a televised address to the nation, Clinton maintained he has
been ``legally accurate'' in denying a sexual relationship with the
25-year-old former White House intern. So prosecutors sought to
show that activities in a hideaway off the Oval Office met the
definition of sex outlined in Clinton's deposition in the separate
Paula Jones sexual harassment suit. Using Lewinsky's testimony
about specific sex acts, Starr's team will try to prove Clinton
committed perjury in the deposition and perhaps later when
testifying before a federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Bates and other members of Starr's team used lawyerly language
to tone down this tawdry tale.
</P>
<P>
   The writing took months. Bates began working in the Office of
the Independent Counsel in 1995. He is a graduate of Harvard
College and Harvard Law School, but has made his mark more as an
author than as an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   His 1993 book, ``Battleground,'' told the story of a
fundamentalist Christian mother's crusade to shield her children
from schoolbooks that she said promoted satanism and evolution. The
case grew into the so-called Scopes II trial in East Tennessee and
attracted publicity minded lawyers from national advocacy groups
like the conservative Concerned Women for America and the liberal
People for the American Way.
</P>
<P>
   Legal Times credited Bates with a ``beautifully researched and
meticulously balanced account of the case.''
</P>
<P>
   His other books include ``If No News, Send Rumors: Anecdotes of
American Journalism,'' ``The Media and Congress'' and ``The Spot:
The Rise of Political Advertising on Television.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past decade, he has also been a prolific provider of
magazine articles on an assortment of subjects. He has written for
publications ranging from the National Journal to TV Guide and
Playboy on topics varying from the Constitution to cyberspace. Last
year, however, Bates and Starr struck out when they tried to
interest publishers in a jointly written, scholarly book on the
separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   Although Time magazine reported that Bates considers himself a
``lapsed Episcopalian,'' he grew up in a Bible Belt town where
Baptists fill the most pews on Sundays. Pecos is known for its
irrigated fields of cantaloupes and claims to be the ``Home of the
World's First Rodeo.'' The region's best-known citizen, the
mythical cowboy Pecos Bill, rode a cyclone to his final glory and
is commemorated in a downtown museum that also features a replica
of Judge Roy Bean's saloon. Pecos is a town where a bookish boy
might take a back seat to the high school football players in their
letter jackets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve was different ... almost like a nerd. Some people gave
him a hard time,'' recalled Cookie Cannon, who along with Bates,
was among the 200 members of the Pecos High School Class of 1976.
``He was a memorable character ... extremely intelligent. But he
didn't seem to care about grades all that much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve had a sister named Suzanne, but called Suky, who is the
same age as my younger sister,'' she said. And the Bates family was
well off, living ``on what we called Silk Stocking Road at the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Cannon said she and Bates worked on
the annual staff and played in the high school band. ``He did
literary stuff. He was very smart,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not arrive at Harvard as an urban sophisticate,'' said
Abigail Thernstrom, who taught Bates in a freshman political
science seminar on constitutional law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Stephen for over 20 years,'' she said. ``He was a
wonderful student. He's a gentleman out of the Old School. He's a
very strong writer with a very nuanced voice. There's not a
strident bone in him. He's not an ideologue.''
</P>
<P>
   Thernstrom and her husband, Stephan,(CQ) are the authors of the
book, ``America in Black and White: One Nation Indivisible,'' which
criticizes granting preferences based on race or sex. She had a
televised run-in with Clinton during a town hall meeting on race in
Akron, Ohio, in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a very good conversation with the president at that
time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Thernstrom has remained friends with Bates over the decades and
praises his talents.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a gorgeous writer,'' she said. ``Politically, he's very
careful. He sees all sides of everything. ... Judge Starr has a
prize.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from law school, Bates was a clerk for U.S.
Appeals Court Judge James Buckley in Washington and has been a
fellow at several think tanks, including the American Enterprise
Institute, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and
the Annenberg Washington Center.
</P>
<P>
   He lives in suburban Silver Spring, Md., with his wife, Polly,
and their daughter, Charlotte.

 &HT;    LAWYERLY AUTHOR BROUGHT IN TO HELP WRITE STARR REPORT
 &HT;    Eds: Updating for all needing and repeating in (w) Washington
and (l) lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To help write the investigative report to Congress
that the world is finally reading, Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr turned to a soft-spoken literary lawyer who shares his
small-town Texas roots.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the hard-bitten career prosecutors who make up most of
the team that has investigated President Clinton for four years,
Stephen Bates was recruited as much for his talents as a scholarly
wordsmith as for his legal skills as a Harvard-educated attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The author of several non-fiction books and an editor of the
Wilson Quarterly, a serious cultural journal, Bates was among the
principal writers of the a massive document that includes explicit
details about Clinton's sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky in
making a case for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very well qualified,'' said Lynn Chu, a New York literary
agent who represents Bates, as well as Starr and House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga. ``He's a terrific lawyer and a really good
writer.''
</P>
<P>
   At 40, Bates is about a decade younger than his boss, but they
have similar backgrounds. While Starr grew up in the tiny Texas
town of Vernon, Bates was reared in Pecos, a dusty agricultural
community of 12,000 souls about 200 miles east of El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what propelled his son from the West Texas prairie to the
nation's capital, Bob Bates declared, ``sheer talent.'' But that's
about all the friendly fertilizer dealer would allow. His son has
asked his family not to talk to reporters, the elder Bates
explained, lest they unwittingly provide ammunition to the ``White
House attack dogs'' eager to discredit Starr's investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a low-profile type anyway,'' Bob Bates said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Stephen Bates did not return phone calls or reply to
e-mail seeking information for this story.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very soft-spoken. Middle of the road politically. Really
smart,'' said Chu. ``He's not going to make any mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The prose about Clinton stretches over 400 pages. Along with the
charges of perjury, abuse of power and obstruction of justice, it
includes embarrassing details of Clinton's sexual relationship with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In a televised address to the nation, Clinton maintained he has
been ``legally accurate'' in denying a sexual relationship with the
25-year-old former White House intern. So prosecutors sought to
show that activities in a hideaway off the Oval Office met the
definition of sex outlined in Clinton's deposition in the separate
Paula Jones sexual harassment suit. Using Lewinsky's testimony
about specific sex acts, Starr's team will try to prove Clinton
committed perjury in the deposition and perhaps later when
testifying before a federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Bates and other members of Starr's team used lawyerly language
to tone down this tawdry tale.
</P>
<P>
   The writing took months. Bates began working in the Office of
the Independent Counsel in 1995. He is a graduate of Harvard
College and Harvard Law School, but has made his mark more as an
author than as an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   His 1993 book, ``Battleground,'' told the story of a
fundamentalist Christian mother's crusade to shield her children
from schoolbooks that she said promoted satanism and evolution. The
case grew into the so-called Scopes II trial in East Tennessee and
attracted publicity minded lawyers from national advocacy groups
like the conservative Concerned Women for America and the liberal
People for the American Way.
</P>
<P>
   Legal Times credited Bates with a ``beautifully researched and
meticulously balanced account of the case.''
</P>
<P>
   His other books include ``If No News, Send Rumors: Anecdotes of
American Journalism,'' ``The Media and Congress'' and ``The Spot:
The Rise of Political Advertising on Television.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past decade, he has also been a prolific provider of
magazine articles on an assortment of subjects. He has written for
publications ranging from the National Journal to TV Guide and
Playboy on topics varying from the Constitution to cyberspace. Last
year, however, Bates and Starr struck out when they tried to
interest publishers in a jointly written, scholarly book on the
separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   Although Time magazine reported that Bates considers himself a
``lapsed Episcopalian,'' he grew up in a Bible Belt town where
Baptists fill the most pews on Sundays. Pecos is known for its
irrigated fields of cantaloupes and claims to be the ``Home of the
World's First Rodeo.'' The region's best-known citizen, the
mythical cowboy Pecos Bill, rode a cyclone to his final glory and
is commemorated in a downtown museum that also features a replica
of Judge Roy Bean's saloon. Pecos is a town where a bookish boy
might take a back seat to the high school football players in their
letter jackets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve was different ... almost like a nerd. Some people gave
him a hard time,'' recalled Cookie Cannon, who along with Bates,
was among the 200 members of the Pecos High School Class of 1976.
``He was a memorable character ... extremely intelligent. But he
didn't seem to care about grades all that much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve had a sister named Suzanne, but called Suky, who is the
same age as my younger sister,'' she said. And the Bates family was
well off, living ``on what we called Silk Stocking Road at the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Cannon said she and Bates worked on
the annual staff and played in the high school band. ``He did
literary stuff. He was very smart,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not arrive at Harvard as an urban sophisticate,'' said
Abigail Thernstrom, who taught Bates in a freshman political
science seminar on constitutional law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Stephen for over 20 years,'' she said. ``He was a
wonderful student. He's a gentleman out of the Old School. He's a
very strong writer with a very nuanced voice. There's not a
strident bone in him. He's not an ideologue.''
</P>
<P>
   Thernstrom and her husband, Stephan,(CQ) are the authors of the
book, ``America in Black and White: One Nation Indivisible,'' which
criticizes granting preferences based on race or sex. She had a
televised run-in with Clinton during a town hall meeting on race in

GE, PLUG POWER TEAM UP TO OFFER ENERGY ALTERNATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JO-ANN JOHNSTON  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLONIE, N.Y. _ An alternative energy company has scored a coup
by getting General Electric Power Systems to be a worldwide
distributor its products: fuel cells that can generate enough
electricity to supply an average-size home or small business.
</P>
<P>
   Plug Power LLC of Colonie and GE Power Systems of Schenectady
plan to form a joint venture company called GE Fuel Cell Systems
that can sell the Plug Power devices across most of the United
States and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   If the memorandum of understanding that the two companies signed
is realized, Plug Power will be the sole supplier of fuel cells of
this size to GE Power Systems division. The division will use its
existing sales force to market the Plug Power products. Volume
sales are expected to start late in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Plug Power got a boost in June when New York Gov. George Pataki
attended the unveiling of a prototype model _ a dishwasher-sized
unit that powers a home _ and said he'd love to have one in the
governor's mansion.
</P>
<P>
   The GE announcement adds even more credibility to Plug Power's
efforts, said Gary Mittleman, president of the company. ``We always
thought we were a leading fuel-cell company worldwide and the
leading company in the United States, and this gives that thinking
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The Plug Power fuel cells take a common fuel, such as propane or
natural gas, and create a chemical reaction that yields
electricity. The process is environmentally cleaner, cheaper and
more reliable than the way electricity is created now at power
plants and distributed over transmission lines, Mittleman said.
</P>
<P>
   A residential fuel cell from Plug Power is expected to cost a
homeowner $3,000 to $5,000 and to last 20 years, he said, with
replacements of some component parts along the way.
</P>
<P>
   GE considers the Plug Power product a ``very innovative
opportunity, one that broadens our product line,'' said spokeswoman
Janice Smith. Before finding this fuel-cell technology, GE Power
Systems didn't have anything small enough to offer the residential
customer or small-business user, Smith noted.
</P>
<P>
   Its next product in terms of wattage power, a microturbine, is
more appropriate for powering a shopping mall or a hospital, she
noted.
</P>
<P>
   Both the GE and Plug Power brand names will be on the Plug Power
fuel cells. GE's brand-name recognition will be invaluable in
swaying the homeowners and small-business users who constitute the
market for Plug Power products, Mittleman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's heard of GE,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   GE expects to go into partnerships with electric and gas
companies and power marketers to reach consumers and small-business
owners. Power providers have a natural link already established
with consumers in local markets.
</P>
<P>
   The only territory where GE does not have marketing rights is
the four-state region of Michigan, Indiana, Ohio and Illinois.
That's because one of Plug Power's two corporate owners, the
corporate parent of Detroit Edison, considers that region home and
retained marketing rights there.
</P>
<P>
   Plug Power will now work with GE to design early production
models to see what specific sizes and control features customers
users most prefer.
</P>
<P>
   That will take place through 1999 and part of 2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, by late 2000, the company should be ready for wider
manufacturing of commercial models. That's when employment at the
company should increase from 140 at present to 300, he said.
</P>
<P>
   GE and Plug Power did not release marketing projections. But
Mittleman said the worldwide fuel cell market is expected to grow
from $500 million a year in 2001 to $3 billion in the span of a few
years. One in four homeowners in the U.S. might want the
technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Further, in developing nations where there are few reliable
sources of electricity, a larger-size model could be created to
supply part of a village with electricity, he said.

HEAL PUBLIC'S BROKEN TRUST, ETHICISTS ADVISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Dr. Joan Brown Campbell, a longtime supporter of the
president, believes Clinton can recover from his current problems
and become an effective leader again.
</P>
<P>
   Her words are filled with caveats, however, and her tone has an
unmistakable air of sadness, uncertainty, and resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is not fatally flawed, but I think he is very,
very deeply wounded,'' Campbell said from her office in New York,
where she is general secretary of the National Council of Churches.
And she wasn't talking politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the public wants a return to the possibility that this
man can be trusted, and I think it's possible he can get there,''
she said. ``But I think that's what's been broken, the trust...and,
in any case, we all will have to decide whether we want to be led
by a repentent sinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Variations on that theme were repeated over and over again
Thursday by ethicists, educators, members of the clergy, and other
Americans who have considered the moral dimensions of Clinton's
affair with former White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the president's most ardent erstwhile admirers came
to the same halting conclusion: Regardless of whether he apologizes
another dozen times, regardless of whether he becomes the subject
of impeachment hearings, regardless of whatever political defense
he offers, the president's behavior has left him on the verge of
becoming a leader without loyal followers _ if he hasn't reached
that point already.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Saxe, a psychology professor at Brandeis University
whose specialty is the subject of lying, described himself as a
Clinton backer and blamed the media for helping create a political
climate in which it's difficult for officials to tell the truth
without severe reprecussions. And he said the president was being
unfairly cast, since Oval Office occupants have lied _ and been
caught at it _ throughout history.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Saxe's judgment of the fallout from the Lewinsky
affair was pointed and harsh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disastrous,'' he said. ``I think the consequences of not
being able to trust what people say threatens our system of
government, but also threatens our relationships with one another.
... It really does threaten our social fabric, our view of
government. It makes us more cyincal about government, and it
threatens our personal relationships'' by raising people's
suspicions about whether their own mates are loyal and honest.
</P>
<P>
   Restoring a political reputation is tough under any
circumstances, and the task has grown increasingly difficult during
a tabloid-driven news era in which political partisans are loath to
let any controversy escape unexploited. But most of those
interviewed Thursday agreed that Clinton faces a particularly
onerous challenge because many people feel personally stung by his
having lied so adamantly on television.
</P>
<P>
   That feeling shows up vividly in public-opinion polls, which
indicate a majority of Americans still support the president's
policies, while a dwindling minority still believe him to be a
credible person. The danger for Clinton, according to those
interviewed, is that the latter sentiment eventually will undermine
the former _ and sooner rather than later if the economy takes a
hit, if the report by special prosecutor Kenneth Starr proves
damning, or if Clinton himself doesn't do enough to counter the
disparate forces mounting against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is new territory, so we just don't know. It's
guessland,'' said Father Robert Drinan, a Georgetown law school
professor who was a US Representative from Massachusetts on the
House Judiciary Committee during impeachment hearings against
President Nixon. ``Nixon wasn't personal ... so now we'll have to
find out how much people expect out of personal morality.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane Mansbridge, a professor at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School
of Government who is studying representation and trust in US
government, made a similar point. Moreover, she argued that the
American people are ``pretty sophisticated'' in their judgments
about how much weight to give salaciousness in assessing a
politician's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``But his repeated lying,'' Mansbridge said of Clinton, ``may
have made the route of compassion and foregiviness much less likely
at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of television talk shows centered on sex, a special
prosecutor's report centered on sex, and Republican-led impeachment
hearings centered on sex, most of those interviewed Thursday
acknowledged it would be hard for the president to turn events to
his advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he can reverse that unless he is willing to go
much further than he is willing or able to go,'' said Michael
Lerner, a onetime informal adviser to Clinton and the editor of the
magazine Tikkun: A Bimonthly Jewish Critique of Politics, Culture
and Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard for anyone to trust anything President Clinton
says to anyone today,'' added Lerner, who said he had been
disappointed by Clinton's policies long before his personal
problems emerged. ``I don't think anyone thinks of him as leader,
representative, or even a person who articulates what we believe
in. I don't think anyone thinks of him like this anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Lerner was among several analysts who expressed the hope that
some good might come out of Clinton's difficult journey, whatever
cynicism it might engender and whatever the president's own
destination turns out to be.
</P>
<P>
   They said, for instance, that Americans might learn to focus
less on subsequent leaders' personal shortcomings and more on their
policies and accomplishments, following a more European model.
</P>
<P>
   Other said this episode could reinforce the moral lesson that
bad behavior ultimately gets punished.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Charren, founder of Action for Children's Television,
suggested that parents _ confronted with the nonstop airing of
sexual escapades, charges that the president is a perjurer, and
other sensational accusations _ try to use this unfolding chapter
of American history as a teaching tool for everything from sex
education, to the need for honesty, to the fallibility of human
beings.
</P>
<P>
   Charren acknowledged, though, that Clinton's behavior had cut
parents' work out for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids used to grow up thinking they wanted to be president.
Now, who wants to be president? Plus there's this feeling of, `Why
should I behave if the president doesn't behave? Why shouldn't I
lie if he lies?' '' said Charren.
</P>
<P>
   She added that there is a potentially positive flip side: ``A
lot seems to happen if you lie.''

MEDICAL EXAMINER MOVED BY GRIM TASK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ Dr. John Butt, a man who works with death
for a living, was shocked when he awoke Sept. 3 to the news that a
trans-Atlantic airliner had plunged into the ocean near his home.
</P>
<P>
   The chief medical examiner for Nova Scotia has examined bodies
for more than 30 years. But the possibility of carnage on such a
scale frightened this man who routinely deals with death.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I never imagined _ well, did I imagine it, yes
_ but did I expect it, no,'' Butt said.
</P>
<P>
   Butt has set himself apart from the stiff-upper-lipped officials
who deliver the bureaucratic briefings and military recountings of
the day's activities along the rocky coast near Peggys Cove. For
him, the grimmest task of his career has unleashed a depth of
emotion that puts a compassionate human face on this tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have trouble with it at times, but it doesn't interfere
with the clarity of my mind,'' Butt said Thursday. ``I feel I'm
doing well, that not losing focus. ... The issue is one of
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Since dawn on Sept. 3, Butt has been immersed in the gruesome,
exhausting, and emotionally wrenching work of examining the
hundreds of pieces of human remains that have speckled the ocean or
been washed ashore. He has catalogued all the parts as he
coordinates a massive, painstaking operation to match human tissue
with the passengers aboard Swissair 111.
</P>
<P>
   And through all the sleepless nights and difficult labor, he has
never been more proud to be a Canadian. ``The focus of the
individuals in this task has been amazing,'' Butt said.
</P>
<P>
   With only one body reclaimed intact, the task has been
laborious, and the pressure of striving to identify victims quickly
and accurately, while considering religious dictums on proper
burial, has placed an enormous strain on him.
</P>
<P>
   Before the crash, Butt led a three-member staff in a
500-square-foot office in Halifax. After reacting to the news by
copying seven pages out of a disaster manual, Butt now coordinates
more than 200 dentists, radiologists, pathologists, and DNA
specialists out of an airplane hangar at the nearby Shearwater
military base.
</P>
<P>
   The base has become his home. ``You see, I live alone with a
couple of dogs that I love very much,'' Butt said. ``But I can't
allow myself to return to that environment alone without someone to
lean on.''
</P>
<P>
   During the day, occupied with the task at hand and the need to
provide leadership, Butt functions as a professional. But as night
comes on, he said, the work begins to fray his stoic edges.
</P>
<P>
   ``At night, I will read things,'' Butt said. ``Last night I
read, `Things That Children Write to God.'''
</P>
<P>
   Butt is concerned that, with no new human remains received in
the last two days, his staff will suffer a letdown. Gearing up for
a new bout with the unthinkable may be tougher than the beginning
of it all.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a time, Butt said, ``when the adrenaline stops flowing
and the other side of the heart starts showing.''

A RARE PEEK INTO PRIVATE-SECTOR PAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The talk show hosts of the world like to rant about
local-government hacks. The Boston Sunday Globe once ran a giant
lobster on the front page making fun of former &UR;  &LR; Governor Edward
King's taste for lobster salad sandwiches. If a business guy runs
for office, you can bet he wants government to operate more like a
business.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the inside scoop on the business of business, though,
isn't easy. Stories about feeding at the government trough are
common because of all the required disclosures. In constrast, the
filings even for exchange-listed companies rarely go beyond what a
few top executives make. It is, after all, the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   But New York state offers a rare window on who makes what in the
insurance industry. The state's insurance department requires
companies doing business there to list all employees and outside
vendors that make $60,000 or more a year. That includes
Massachusetts insurers like John Hancock and Massachusetts Mutual.
It's the best $11 of our publisher's money we have spent in a long
time.
</P>
<P>
   Question to John Hancockers: Do you know what the guy in the
office next to yours makes? We do.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Let's start with the Million Dollar Club. Eight Hancock
executives made $1 million or more in salary and bonus last year,
according to the New York filing. Chairman Stephen L. Brown was No.
1, of course, at $2.9 million, &UR;  &LR; followed by retired president
William Boyan Jr. &UR;  &LR; at $1.8 million and vice chairman Foster Aborn
at $1.6 million. David D'Alessandro, who gets more press than all
the other suits combined, was paid $1.3 millionas senior executive
vice president, but probably got a boost when he became president
in January.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether 27 &UR;  &LR; people made $500,000 or more at John Hancock and
another 110 people made $200,000 to $500,000. But Hancock's filing,
which includes 19 pages of who got what, understates what Hancock
pays its top people &UR;  &LR; because the report does not include the
company's money management and other subsidaries. We're willing to
bet that a number of those at John Hancock Mutual Funds and
Independent Investment Associates make $1 million or more a year,
and some could well top Brown's compensation package.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for Massachusetts Mutual. The Springfield, Mass.
insurer had six &UR;  &LR; current or former executives in the Million Dollar
Club. Chairman Thomas Wheeler topped the list at $3.5 million. &UR;  &LR; In
all 15 made $500,000 or more and another 60 made $200,000 to
$500,000. But those numbers do not include its successful money
management units like OppenheimerFunds and David L. Babson.
</P>
<P>
   Both John Hancock and MassMutual say their pay packages reflect
what it costs to attract and retain good people. They also say
compensation for top executives is heavily skewed toward
performance incentives and reflects the good years the companies
have been enjoying recently.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock had its best year ever in 1997. It reported a net gain,
or profit, of $506 million, up 41 &UR;  &LR; percent from a year earlier, and
saw assets under management grow 11 percent. MassMutual's profits
were up 32 percent to $304 million, and assets under management
grew 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But there wasn't a lot of talk of record profits or big bonuses
earlier this year when both companies were pressing Beacon Hill for
two pieces of legislation, one that would provide the industry a
$50 million tax cut and another that would allow the insurers to
sell stock to the public without giving up management control.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, both companies emphasized how the current tax system
was unfair to Massachusetts-based insurers and how important it was
for the companies to be able to dip into the public markets for new
capital to remain competitive. The Legislature approved both bills.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock says drawing comparisons between its profitability and
the tax cut is unfair and misses the point of why the Legislature
acted. ``The comparisons you're now trying to draw _ that one issue
somehow sheds light on the other _ misrepresents the facts and
borders on the disingenuous,'' Hancock spokesman Stephen Burgay
said Thursday. The tax cut, fully phased in, will save Hancock $12
million to $14 million a year, he said; MassMutual will save about
$7.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies say the pay packages reflect the fact that as
mutual insurers, owned by their policyholders, they cannot offer
executives the same kind of stock options that publicly held
companies can. Look for that to change: Hancock has already said it
plans to demutualize and sell stock to the public, and MassMutual
is also exploring ways to go public.
</P>
<P>
   Do you think that in a world where they keep score by who has
the biggest paycheck that it escaped anyone's attention who was the
state's highest paid insurance executive last year? He was John F.
O'Brien, chief executive of the much smaller but publicly held
Allmerica Financial Corp., who made $3.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Hancock and MassMutual filings make great reading. Some
highlights:
</P>
<P>
   _Hancock's list is full of familiar names.
</P>
<P>
   Hill Holliday boss Jack Connors is Hancock's lowest-paid
director at $43,000. On the other hand, $25.5 million in Hancock
money flowed through Connors' advertising agency. Most of that
represented purchases of corporate advertising and fees for
Hancock's sponsorship of the Olympics, but about $3 million &UR;  &LR; went
as revenue to Hill Holliday, executives of both companies say.
Connors said his firm's total revenue will be around $96
million &UR;  &LR; this year.
</P>
<P>
   Other familiar names that show up: John Sasso's political
consulting firm was paid $222,922; Larry Moulter's &UR;  &LR; Woolf
Associates made $229,167; and former Dukakis adviser Nick
Mitropoulos  &UR;  &LR; got $104,200.
</P>
<P>
   _Hancock's petty cash drawer is always full.
</P>
<P>
   Rentokil Tropical Plant Services was paid $273,047. &UR;  &LR; The Boston
Red Sox message board cost Hancock $173,334, and a gift shop
consultant $62,524. Joseph E. McCain Investigative Services got
$114,159. (Whom do you think they were paid to investigate?) A
``plumber foreperson'' might have been a bargain at $78,951, all
things considered. Hancock didn't list an ``executive chauffeur,''
though MassMutual did. Salary: $61,492.48.
</P>
<P>
   _Other executive tidbits.
</P>
<P>
   MassMutual directors do a lot better than their counterparts at
Hancock. The median salary for directors at MassMutual is $94,000
vs. $52,000 for Hancock.
</P>
<P>
   Some women are making a lot of dough at both companies, but not
as much as men. Only five women cracked the list of 27 executives
making $500,000 or more at Hancock. No. 1 on the list: executive
vice president Diane Capstaff at $955,324. Only one woman makes the
$500,000 Club at MassMutual, Anne Melissa Dowling, a senior vice
president, at $721,597.
</P>
<P>
   Burgay, Hancock's vice president of advertising and public
affairs, is a good example of the difference between the scrutiny
of public and private payrolls. The last time Burgay's salary was
in the newspaper was back in the early '80s when he was making
beans at the Metropolitan District Commission. Last year he made
$195,533 and nobody cared, until now.
</P>
<P>
   His counterpart at MassMutual, Eustis &UR;  &LR; Walcott, did even better.
He made $239,205.95.
</P>
<P>
   It's not your tax money to be sure, but it's worth considering
the next time your quarterly insurance premium arrives in the mail.

CAST ASIDE ALL THOSE DOUBTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We are not on the verge of seeing rusty leaves fall from the
trees. The Patriots do not have a game Sunday. Another school year
did not just begin. Sixty-one is still one of the most sacred
numbers in baseball. And, most important, today is not Sept. 11.
Today's date is March 11, 1998. If you don't believe that, you
obviously haven't spent enough time absorbing the panicked vibes of
Red Sox fans.
</P>
<P>
   Many Sox supporters awoke this morning armed with new worries
for outrageously old problems. They are not so sure about the
outfield. They don't know whom they can trust to get a hit beyond
Mo Vaughn and Nomar Garciaparra. They do know they can count on
Pedro Martinez to pitch three times in a seven-game series, but
they don't know if the Sox have enough power to make it to the
postseason, let alone tangle with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Well, yo, I guess my last name should be Van Winkle. But with a
slight remix. Apparently, I slept all the way back to March. I see
people with blue-and-red ``B'' hats on their heads. They are
terrified. It's crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the hitting and outfield and pitching were
concerns six weeks and six months ago. Remember? That's why the Sox
have been so much fun to watch this season.
</P>
<P>
   The unspoken understanding was that each of their 82 wins was a
win over baseball's Star System. Be honest. Back in March, many
games did you expect them to win? Eighty-two? Not me. I had them
somewhere between 78 and 81. I couldn't see them over .500 and
thought the Yankees, Orioles, and even Blue Jays were better.
Everyone knows the Yankees are better. And if the Sox meet them in
the playoffs, they won't beat them. But once again: So what? No one
in the American League is going to beat them. Not the Indians, not
the Sox, not the Rangers/Angels. Why is this new?
</P>
<P>
   The Sox are intriguing because, at times, they have approached
the Yankees, Orioles, and Indians with Mike Benjamin, Damon Buford,
and Midre Cummings and not flinched. That's why you learned to like
them, no? You liked them because general managers around baseball
were whispering about the iffiness of Bret Saberhagen's arm, yet
you rarely saw Saberhagen miss his turn in the rotation. Maybe you
started to get into them because they had a first-year full-time
closer who made the All-Star team. Or a manager who, despite being
the second or third or fourth choice for the job, is now leading
the American League wild-card scramble while men such as Tony La
Russa and Jim Leyland will be home during playoff time.
</P>
<P>
   Oh. The playoffs. Sox fans are worried about them, too. They
shouldn't. It may be interesting that this is the 20-year
anniversary of Boston's Fall Collapse. But that's where the
comparisons should stop. Can anyone in good conscience compare the
1978 Yankees _ the World Series champion Yankees _ to the '98 Blue
Jays and '98 Rangers, who are both tugging at the tail of the Sox?
The '78 Yankees had Ron Guidry. The current Rangers have Aaron
Sele. Come now. Boston fans are fearing a Sele team?
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays and Roger Clemens are making things interesting
(and sorry, Dan Duquette, Jose Canseco for John Wasdin was, uh, not
so good). But they have Darrin Fletcher in their lineup. They have
a struggling Junior Cruz in their lineup. They depend on Alex
Gonzalez, who struck out six times the other night. And I think it
tells you about their character that they decided to catch the
fever in late August. What makes the Blue Jays any different than
Kevin Kennedy's last Boston team, the '96 bunch that decided it
wanted to be in the playoffs in August after a horrible start?
</P>
<P>
   Honestly, in the world of rotisserie baseball, I would take the
lineups of the Mariners, Indians (with a healthy Jim Thome plus
Richie Sexson), and Rangers over that of the Sox. But there is no
rotisserie equivalent of what to do when another team is pressuring
you with a few weeks left in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry about the Sox. They will make the playoffs. They
have been steady all year. You can also be certain that they will
not be afflicted with complacency; they are not talented enough to
be complacent. We all knew in March that if they were going to win,
the gods of pitching mounds and outfields would have to bless them.
Consider them blessed.
</P>
<P>
   They have won on borrowed time and, fortunately for them, they
gave themselves enough room to slide into the postseason. They have
enough to win a Division Series. They will not be the American
League champions. Give that to the Yankees. Everyone knows that.
We've known it for months, since, maybe, March.

STAIN IS BEST ON PINE PICNIC TABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, September 13, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I built a picnic table of pine. What should be used to
preserve it? Would any perservative be save for children eating off
the table?
</P>
<P>
   JOHN ADAMS, Somerville, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You could treat it with a clear sealer, which must be
reapplied every year or two, creating an unavoidable maintenance
situation. Be sure to treat all surfaces, including the underside
of the top and all legs and connectors.
</P>
<P>
   But I think it'd be better to use a semitransparent stain; you
can get the color of your choice, it will dry well enough so it
will not rub off on clothing, and it will preserve the wood
probably better than a sealer. And, good news, it will last three
to five years. As for safety as an eating area, it will not be a
problem as long as the kids don't chew it, and as long as they use
plates. Incidental picking up of food should not be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The outside flap of my exhaust fan does not close when the
fan goes off. The fan is housed in a hood, so it opens on a
horizontal plane rather than a vertical plane as on a fan installed
in a wall. My neighbors have similar ones that work well. It is a
Nu-Tone.
</P>
<P>
   JOHN DONNELLY, Needham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It sounds as if the spring or other device that closed the
flap when the fan stops is broken or gone. I would contact Nu-Tone,
which has a good name in ventilation and which should be happy to
fix it, even for a fee, to keep up its good name.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am replacing the spruce floorboards (they rotted out) with
pressure-treated boards in a 10- by 40-foot deck. I think the
joists and other parts of the frame are OK. Should I put the new
boards lengthwise and parallel to the house, the way the original
boards were, or should I put them at right angles to the house, so
I can use 10-foot boards and don't have to butt any boards
together, end to end.
</P>
<P>
   THEO MADDEN, Duxbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Put them the same way as the original boards were; keep a
3/8-inch gap where they butt end to end, over a joist. If you tried
putting the boards at right angles to the house, you would have to
rebuild the frame.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem you might have is water staying in that joint
where the boards butt end to end over a joist. In fact, that is
where decay might have occurred in the frame. To get around that, I
suggest you lay an extra joist an inch or so away from the original
joist, wherever boards butt end to end. That way you can have the
gap between board ends, but the water will drip into the space
under the deck, preventing further decay.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My house was built 15 years ago with all cedar board siding.
It was treated with Aquatrol preservative until it was
discontinued. Now it is treated with CWF-UV. My problem is that
sunny areas are bleached out, and shaded areas are very dark.
</P>
<P>
   I would like to paint the house a cedar color to reduce
maintenance and have a more even color. Can I paint over the CWF-UV
or must it be removed?
</P>
<P>
   R. NORTON, Rainbow Springs, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. One must assume that the cedar is still in good shape, other
than bleaching out and darkening. For starters, check those black
areas to see if they are mold or mildew. Put bleach on a small area
of the black; if it turns to cedar color in five seconds or so, it
is mold, and it must be removed. Kill it and remove it with a
solution of one part bleach and three parts water, then rinse. Wear
skin and eye protection when working with bleach. If the bleach
test does not turn it light color, then it is weathering and
nothing has to be done, although you might want to sand it to the
bare cedar in order to keep the new treatment even.
</P>
<P>
   I think you can prime and paint over the CWF, but I would not
suggest paint or primer, but rather semitransparent stain, which
you can get in a cedar-look color. One coat is needed, and the
stain will last three to five years. The stain might go over the
CWF, particularly if the CWF has weathered for a year or more. So,
treat a small area with the semitransparent stain; if the stain
beads up, stop, because it is not penetrating the wood, and you
have to let the CWF wear off or sand thoroughly before trying the
stain again. And, the CWF may stay longer on protected areas such
as under windows and eaves, so you might have to sand those areas
anwyay.
</P>
<P>
   If the cedar sucks up the stain without beading up, go ahead
with the stain for an even, long-lasting finish.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am putting in a used radiator to replace a smaller one in
my son's room. How can I clean out the used radiator? The boiler is
only three years old, and I am getting a lot of rusty, sludgy water
when I drain the boiler.
</P>
<P>
   ROB WARREN, Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Remove the steam valve of the used radiator and flush it with
a hose or a pressure-washer. The rusty, sludgy water is probably
not coming from the new boiler but from the other radiators in the
system. In that case, you might try flushing all the other
radiators.
</P>

PUBLIC OPINION SEEN AS KEY PLAYER IN CLINTON DRAMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER S. CANELLOS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Members of Congress will return to their districts this weekend
with eyes focused on Kenneth Starr's report and ears tuned to the
reactions of their constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment occurs in a realm between the legal and the
political worlds, and the will of the people, measured in
public-opinion polls and in whispers to members of Congress at fall
festivals throughout the country, will play at least as great a
role in deciding the fate of President Clinton as Starr's legal
arguments, specialists say.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion has been an unspoken factor in the investigation
of Clinton from the start, with members of Congress generally
refraining from condemning a president who commanded the support of
a majority. Even after Clinton admitted lying about his affair with
Monica S. Lewinsky, most voters, in polls, resisted the idea that
he should be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's report could change people's minds. But until that
happens, Congressional leaders are likely to proceed cautiously,
with one ear to the ground, observers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, impeachment is a political thing to some extent,''
said former Massachusetts Congressman Robert F. Drinan, who
introduced the articles of impeachment against former President
Richard M. Nixon, then watched public support for impeachment grow
with each revelation, culminating in Nixon's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Some consideration of public opinion seems to have been built
into the system, or, at least, to have moved in through the cracks
in impeachment law.
</P>
<P>
   ``High crimes and misdemeanors,'' the Constitutional standard
for removing a president from office, is one of the most debated
terms of art in American law: Scholars continue to disagree about
whether it means a president can be removed for any crime, only
serious crimes, or perhaps just a great breach of faith that may or
may not even be a crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an obscure phrase whose historical meaning is not
clear,'' said David Stewart, the lawyer who represented Judge
Walter L. Nixon, the defendant in the most recent impeachment case
before Congress, in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Nixon's case, more than that of the president with whom he
shared a last name, set the boundaries of impeachment law: In
refusing to hear Nixon's appeal, the Supreme Court declared the
definition of ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' to be a political
question, outside its purview.
</P>
<P>
   The case could have an enormous impact on the fate of Clinton,
specialists said Thursday, because it leaves Congress free to
establish its own definition of impeachment _ and some prominent
members, including Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-New York), have
already suggested that grounds for impeachment need not be
restricted to ``legal issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think high crimes and misdemeanors is a very elastic phrase
at this point in history,'' said Stewart. ``Congress can impose it
broadly, if they choose to, and the Supreme Court will not review
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, many specialists believe that Congress will increasingly
takes it cues less from its legal advisers than from its
constituents. The recent judicious stance of House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, for example, reflects the wait-and-see mood of the
public, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart maintains that a cautious, step-by-step approach,
allowing the case to develop over time, as the public digests each
detail, is appropriate. The impeachment of a president, he
explained, is fundamentally different from that of federal judges _
three of whom, including Judge Nixon, were removed from office in
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole world is watching,'' when a presidency is in the
balance, Stewart said. ``Judicial impeachments are very private
affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some members of Congress and legal specialists say that a
dramatic shift in public opinion against Clinton should be factored
into any impeachment decision. Moynihan, for one, has argued that
the moral revulsion of the public over Clinton's affair could, in
theory, be grounds for his ouster.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, say that to give public opinion such a potent
role is unfair to the accused _ in this case, Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Tracey Maclin, a constitutional law professor at Boston
University believes that impeachment is, foremost, a legal action,
and should be carried out in an atmosphere of objectivity and due
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Framers were quite clear that they were talking
about criminal behavior,'' Maclin said. ``Granted, people will have
their own views on Clinton's lying to the public, or engaging in an
immoral affair, but I'd hope that would not be part of this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think impeachment is about politics,'' he added.
``Impeachment is about criminal behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the humid air of Philadelphia's Independence Hall in
1787, the Founding Fathers circulated several different standards
for removing the president from office. The first,
``maladministration,'' seemed too broad; the second, ``treason and
bribery,'' seemed too narrow. They ultimately borrowed the term
``high crimes and misdemeanors'' from English law.
</P>
<P>
   Although most impeachments of judges in the 19th Century were
for outright corruption, mostly for taking bribes, the one effort
to impeach a president was framed by politics and, to an extent,
public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Brimming with anger over President Andrew Johnson's obstruction
of measures that would punish the South for the Civil War, Congress
sought to limit Johnson's powers through the ``Tenure of Office
Act,'' requiring Congressional approval before the president could
remove a member of his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Since Johnson had assumed the presidency after the assassination
of Abraham Lincoln, the act effectively obliged him to retain
Lincoln's cabinet, the team that had waged the Civil War. Johnson
considered the act an illegal usurpation of the president's powers,
and moved to fire Lincoln's obstreperous Secretary of War, Edwin
Stanton, without Congress' okay.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, an unelected president who hailed from Tennessee, a
state of the former Confederacy, wasn't popular in either region of
the country _ in the North for his alleged Southern sympathies; in
the South for remaining loyal to the Union during the Civil War.
And much of the public, along with the House of Representatives,
supported his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, after a raucus debate, the Senate failed by one vote to
remove him. His supporters based their votes on the belief that the
Tenure of Office Act itself was unconstitutional, and that
Johnson's violation of it was thus justified.
</P>
<P>
   Many historians consider the Johnson case a triumph of law over
public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Drinan, a leading figure in the impeachment hearings
against President Nixon, predicts that public opinion will be a
factor throughout Congress's consideration of Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   Already, he said, House Republicans are trying to determine
public reaction to their plan to release significant portions of
Starr's report before giving Clinton a chance to respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans are (already) conscious of a possible
backlash, if they appear to be unfair,'' Drinan, a Democrat, said.
</P>
<P>
   And the unusual circumstances surrounding the charges against
Clinton make his case more difficult to gauge. Drinan, now a
professor at Georgetown University Law Center, points to the lack
of an ``underlying crime'' that would give weight to any charges of
perjury or obstruction of justice. The vehicle for Clinton's
alleged offenses was a sexual harassment lawsuit that ultimately
was thrown out of court _ and that some considered tainted by
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave Nixon a fair trial for months in the judiciary
committee,'' said Drinan.
</P>
<P>
   It will take at least that long, he suggested, to bring any
order to the case against Clinton.

MEDICAL MIRACLE DRAWS A CROWD, 150 YEARS LATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOIS R. SHEA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAVENDISH, Vt. _ It's the case of a certifiable medical wonder,
one that every 10-year-old in this town can recite by heart _ the
hideous accident and miraculous recovery of Phineas P. &UR;  &LR; Gage.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have been transfixed since the day in 1848 &UR;  &LR; when,
during a railroad accident, an iron rod blasted through Gage's
skull, yet he lived another 13 years to tell the tale.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, on the 150th anniversary of the accident,
Cavendish is throwing a down-home festival _ and rather serious
scientific symposium _ in Gage's honor.
</P>
<P>
   Neurologists from as far away as the Netherlands will gather at
the Okemo Mountain Resort to, among other things, view X-rays of
Gage's skull and discuss research on the brain's frontal
lobes. &UR;  &LR; Participants will hear a lecture on the case by an
Australian physician and enjoy a barbecue put on by the American
Legion.
</P>
<P>
   The skull _ whose usual resting place is at Harvard Medical
School _ is having a homecoming of sorts, and will be on display in
Cavendish along with the troublesome tamping iron.
</P>
<P>
   The case baffled scientists and helped cement new theories about
the human brain. Skull piercing, after all, can change a person.
Although Gage, 25 at the time, retained his physical faculties, he
went from being a mild-mannered railroad worker to an ill-tempered,
foul-mouthed cuss. Phineas, as his friends would say later, was no
longer Phineas.
</P>
<P>
   It all happened here, at a place where the tracks curve through
the woods, where jewelweed and goldenrod grow in tangles along the
rail bed.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Natale, a local chiropractor and president of the
Cavendish Chamber of Commerce, stood on the tracks recently and
recounted the tale.
</P>
<P>
   It was a hot September day in 1848, and railroad workers were
blasting stone to make way for the Rutland and Burlington Railroad.
Workers drilled holes in the stone and dropped in dynamite.
</P>
<P>
   Gage, a foreman, tamped the dynamite into place with an iron rod
before lighting the fuse. But something went wrong. Gage poked at
the explosives with the rod, a spark flew, and _ KABOOM.
</P>
<P>
   The force of the explosion shot the skinny, 3 1/2-foot-long rod
into Gage's left cheek, through his brain and out the top of his
skull. It flew through the air and landed some yards away, the
Boston Post would report.
</P>
<P>
   Gage never even lost consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   He was helped to an ox cart by his men, and driven _ sitting
upright &UR;  &LR; _ three-quarters of a mile to the Adams Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Gage was tended to by a pair of country physicians. According to
one doctor's notes, Gage at one point vomited so violently, the
force caused about a ``half a teacup full'' of brain matter to
spill from the wound in his head.
</P>
<P>
   He was measured for a coffin.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't die. He recovered (with no help from an MRI or
antibiotics) and went on to become a scientific wonder whose case
is still taught in medical schools.
</P>
<P>
   Gage lost a significant chunk of gray matter. Amazingly, he
could still breathe, walk, talk, add, subtract, and drive a team of
horses. But his personality changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was grossly profane afterward,'' said Natale, and became
``very unreliable.''
</P>
<P>
   Gage's strange case eventually helped convince scientists that
different parts of the brain served different functions, a concept
that seemed outlandish in 1848.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to think in terms of the time,'' said Dr. H. Richard
Tyler, a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School. ``In
1848 there was no idea that the brain had any localized function
... we were just coming out of the area when you loved with your
heart and hated with your spleen.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gage, who appeared in a circus sideshow before he died of
epileptic seizures in 1861, still plays a role in some of that
research.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, a pair of University of Iowa neurologists used
sophisticated neuroimaging techniques and a donated brain to
conduct something of a ``virtual autopsy'' on Gage's skull to
pinpoint which parts of his damaged brain caused his personality to
be altered so radically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody who tries to explain it will have their own ideas
about where the lesion was,'' said Tyler. ``We really only know
where (the tamping iron) came in and went out. We really don't know
what happened in between ... it's more looked at as a fun,
historical case.''
</P>
<P>
   Locally, the case is the stuff of legend and lore. It is
even &UR;  &LR; used at Cavendish Town Elementary school to teach everything
from history to biology. School nurse Daphne Leattemmer made a
brain out of peach Jell-O this week for her lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This little town is on the map because of this man who made
medical history,'' Leattemmer said, as she stood in the hallway,
the gelatinous noggin balanced on a paper plate.
</P>
<P>
   Ten-year-old Nathan Ranney, meanwhile, was painting a portrait
of Gage on a huge mural in the school gymnasium. The festival in
Cavendish will also feature a parade (children on bikes,
rollerblades or skates must wear helmets, no exceptions), a pancake
breakfast and train rides past the spot where Gage's skull was
pierced.
</P>
<P>
   T-shirts emblazoned with the likeness of Gage's skull will be
for sale, as will more ``high-end'' souveniers, said Natale _ like
authentic reproductions of the errant tamping iron.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it's got to be one of the silliest reasons to
have a festival that I ever heard of _ somebody got a poker through
the head,'' said Priscilla Mounts of Cavendish. ``Still, it'll be
fun.''

GOP FINDS BOND: STOP HARSHBARGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN   AND FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After all the sniping and charging, complaining and
name-calling, Republicans Paul Cellucci and Joseph D. Malone agreed
on one thing Thursday: Democrat Scott Harshbarger should not become
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the Republican candidates for governor said the
Massachusetts GOP would come together after the Sept. 15 primary
for fear that Harshbarger, one of three Democrats running for the
gubernatorial nomination, could win the corner office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott Harshbarger will be a governor who would try to outspend
the Legislature,'' predicted Cellucci, the acting governor. ``Do
people really think that Scott Harshbarger, who's had all these new
spending proposals, is really going to be able to impose discipline
on the state Legislature? I think that will certainly unite
Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone, the state Treasurer, said he believes he will win
Tuesday's primary and Republicans will join forces because they
will not want to support Harshbarger, who says Bill Clinton is his
favorite president and Mike Dukakis was his favorite governor.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens if Cellucci wins the primary? After all of
Malone's allegations about Cellucci's ethical transgressions and
all his complaints about policy positions, Malone said he could set
aside his problems with the acting governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a loyal conservative Republican, and given the choice
between a liberal Republican and a liberal Democrat, I'll choose
Paul Cellucci, the liberal Republican,'' Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger, the attorney general, had a different view. After
watching Wednesday night's Republican debate, Harshbarger said
neither Malone nor Cellucci had anything good to offer the
Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger called the debate a ``food fight,'' saying the back
and forth between Cellucci and Malone was ``shallow and insensitive
sound-bite politics,'' and he challenged the two Republican rivals
to ``get out of the gutter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What the people of Massachusetts saw was two Republican
accountants playing tennis with live hand grenades,'' Harshbarger
told reporters. ``I am sure it was exciting for people who like to
see blood spilled, but it offered no hope for the working people of
this state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It proved that the only difference between Paul Cellucci and
Joe Malone is that Joe Malone acknowledges that he is a
Republican,'' he said. ``Paul Cellucci's problem is that he is a
Republican who wishes he could be a Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   To prove his point, Harshbarger noted that Cellucci took credit
for a number of social programs, including education reform, health
care for children, and a $1 billion tax cut _ all of which were
Democratic initiatives, the attorney general said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not one sentence uttered by Paul Cellucci or Joe Malone last
night had anything to do with improving the life of working people
in Massachusetts,'' Harshbarger said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, Cellucci and Malone rehashed one of their
sharpest disagreements from the debate. Cellucci continued to press
for Malone to investigate whether anyone affiliated with his
campaign illegally obtained and distributed personal credit reports
for Cellucci, Cellucci's wife, and Cellucci's father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he answered the question,'' Cellucci said of
Malone's quick sidestep Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only so many suspects,'' Cellucci said, explaining why
he is suspicious of the Malone camp. ``I only have so many
opponents in this race. The fact that he can't answer the question
is one of the reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   But Malone said Cellucci is the person who is not answering the
more important question _ about why the acting governor owes so
much money. He also said his campaign had nothing to do with
Cellucci's credit report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, he's using the Bill Clinton tactic of trying to
avoid answering the question on his own right of his debt,'' Malone
said. ``Instead, he's saying there's a conspiracy; people are out
to get me. It didn't work with Bill Clinton; it won't work with
Paul Cellucci.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked again about his campaign's involvement with obtaining
Cellucci's credit report, Malone was resolute. ``Absolutely I'm
denying that we had anything to do with it,'' he said. ``Paul
Cellucci, if he has one shred of evidence that we had anything to
do with it, ought to speak up.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone said that if Cellucci's debt, estimated at about
$710,000, has gone up, then Cellucci should explain it to the
voters. Cellucci has said his debts come from paying for private
school tuition for his daughters and renovations to his home. He
has provided no further details.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul Cellucci needs to come to grip with answering the
questions,'' Malone said.

THE REAL WINNER OF THE BLOODY CELLUCCI-MALONE DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What is happening to the Republican Party in Massachusetts is
like an Ingemar Bergman movie, a gothic tale in black and white of
intrigue and revenge, culminating in a fratricidal conflict inside
the crumbling walls of the old castle, while the enemy masses
without.
</P>
<P>
   Count Cellucci and Baron Malone cut and thrust with their
broadswords, swing the mace, fumble for the dirk, and tip over urns
of boiling oil in their mad rush to maim their brother, seemingly
heedless of the armies of Democrats seizing the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   The acting governor and the outgoing treasurer employed their
worst weapons and most wounding words Wednesday night in their
final preprimary TV joust. Both knights staggered from the field,
limping back to their tents and the wan backpats of disheartened
followers dreading the great battle on the morrow, the November
general election eight weeks hence.
</P>
<P>
   With your own leaders stabbing each other, there's not enough
bile left for the real foe. In a state where Republicans count for
less than one out of eight registered voters, with four
independents and three Democrats for every GOP stalwart, Joe
Malone's primary challenge to Paul Cellucci was planned as
regicide, but turned to fratricide, and may lead the GOP to
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Domke, a Republican consultant analyzing the melee for New
England Cable News, was almost disconsolate: ``The real winner of
tonight's debate, unfortunately, was probably (Scott)
Harshbarger.'' With word next morning that the relentlessly
methodical attorney general had picked up the endorsement of even a
union leader he'd prosecuted for irregularities, the lineup of
labor support for the Democrats' frontrunner is practically
wall-to-wall.
</P>
<P>
   Both Cellucci and Malone were in their best debating form, and
had to be. Nothing was held back. Any misgivings or mistakes of the
campaign were forgotten as they shredded each other's record,
deportment, ethics, and chances in November.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci blamed Malone for ``the most negative campaign in this
state's history,'' a claim that will be stoutly denied by legions
of Bay State pols, living and dead, whose feats of negative
campaigning grow more heroic in the mellowing of memory. ``Here it
comes, all right, here it comes,'' said Malone, dipping into the
smudgepot for his rejoinders, that Cellucci ate lobbyist-tainted
fare, countenanced ``shaking down the people who work in the
National Guard,'' and muffed the commutation of a murderer who
fabricated a sob story about being a Vietnam vet.
</P>
<P>
   Malone is a smoother and more articulate debater. His strategy
was obvious but risky: Predicate your attack on the assumption that
turnout will be low, and aim your pitch to the rock-ribbed
conservatives who loved Reagan, hate taxes, and don't fall for that
liberal soft-soap about helping out the poor or reducing class size
for the sprats who populate public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, whose record at the Treasury was excellent, in
administering, downsizing and innovating, apparently was beguiled
by a right-wing campaign consultant who persuaded him to run
against Mike Dukakis and liberalism, trying to portray Cellucci as
a bastard son of both. A moderate with lots of appeal to the yuppie
mutual-fund broker types, Malone has metamorphosed into a
small-bore conservative, ranting about 16-year-olds getting
abortions without parental consent, and arguing a quizzical thesis:
``This booming economy is because Ronald Reagan stood up to the
Soviet Union.'' Since Reagan was first elected 18 years ago, and
Dukakis was three governors back, either Malone or his consultant
seemed to have missed at least a decade or more.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, who sat on a big lead and made some elemental
political mistakes on the job (vetoing a $200 million package of
library improvements and other local projects was braindead in an
election season), resolutely defended. ``He has no ideas. He has no
plans. He has no vision,'' was one refrain with which he taunted
Malone. The treasurer was flummoxed by WBZ's John Henning's demand
to know what programs Malone would cut. No meaningful answer came
back.
</P>
<P>
   But the most telling thrust of the evening came from another
panelist, Globe reporter Adrian Walker: Did Malone or ``anyone
connected with your campaign'' play a role in obtaining private and
confidential credit rating reports on Cellucci, his wife, and
father. These reports, circulated for weeks and finally made public
by TV stations, detail more than $700,000 in personal debt.
</P>
<P>
   Malone twice ducked the question, lamely countering, ``I have
never seen any credit report of Paul Cellucci's.'' Cellucci sniffed
that broaching his private finances, ``and my family's,'' proved
Malone took campaigning ``to a new low.''
</P>
<P>
   On Channel 2 afterword, former US Representative Chet Atkins, a
Democrat roped in as analyst, scored that as a direct hit on
Malone's anatomy. ``He's going to be picking darts out of his
backside for a long time.'' But the collateral damage extends to
the Republican Party. Its two statewide officeholders, the only
front-line elected officials higher than the handful of GOP state
senators, are killing each other, depressing primary turnout with
scorched earth campaigning and nasty TV spots that only a
consultant could love. These two may be responsible for
exterminating that endangered species, the Republican incumbent.

INVENTION MAY REVOLUTIONIZE DETECTION OF CLOGGED ARTERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, N.Y. _ A new hand-held device that can identify dangerous
deposits of cholesterol by sound may soon offer physicians an
easier, cheaper and more reliable way to screen patients for
cardiovascular disease.
</P>
<P>
   Michael I. Savic, a sound specialist and engineering professor
at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, is putting the finishing
touches on his invention, a cross between a stethoscope and
ultrasound machine, before sending it to the Food and Drug
Administration for consideration.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, the device could mean a step forward for diagnosing
America's No. 1 health problem.
</P>
<P>
   Some 4 million Americans suffered a stroke in 1995 and some 58
million have some form of cardiovascular disease.
</P>
<P>
   Health experts say Savic's device holds promise because it is
small, convenient and potentially cheap enough to be used as a
screening device on older Americans, picking up on problems before
they develop into cardiovascular disease, including stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with strokes, and that's what we're trying to
prevent, is that most people don't have any warning signs,'' said
Ann Marie Kupinski, the director of the vascular laboratory at the
Albany Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Savic, 69, came up with the idea for a cholesterol detection
system at a party five or six years ago, when a physician told him
it was possible to hear some blockages using a trained ear and a
stethoscope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said if you can detect it by ear, we can do it better by
machine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And many specialists are already using the latest in ultrasound
imaging devices to detect clogged arteries and determine whether
patients are candidates for surgical procedures, including
angiograms.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with existing technology, however, is cost. The
price tag on some current ultrasound machines can range from
$200,000 to more than $1 million, making it too expensive for
routine use.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really isn't a good screening device,'' Kupinski said.
</P>
<P>
   Savic's goal was to come up with a cheaper alternative that
could be used as commonly as a stethoscope but as reliably as the
more expensive ultrasound.
</P>
<P>
   Savic's solution is a device no bigger than a Magic Marker.
</P>
<P>
   When placed against the carotid artery, the main blood vessel
that carries blood to the brain, it monitors blood flow and sends
the information to a computer in the doctor's office that can
identify sound wave patterns associated with a blockage.
</P>
<P>
   The computer then spits out a number that quantifies the extent
of the problem. Physicians, armed with this information, could then
quickly determine the degree of hardening in the arteries and refer
patients to appropriate care.
</P>
<P>
   Savic's device doesn't yet have a price tag, but he expects it
to be within reach of most primary care physicians. He has already
signed an agreement with a company to manufacture and market the
tool.
</P>
<P>
   During the initial stages of designing his cholesterol detection
system, Savic started by trying to replicate the problem of clogged
arteries in his lab, using an artificial patient made of red
Jell-O, a heart pump and a mixture of milk and iron powder to
imitate blood.
</P>
<P>
   He used glue to duplicate the effect of cholesterol deposits.
</P>
<P>
   From those primitive beginnings, he's since come up with a
sophisticated software program that can analyze the sound of real
blood flowing through arteries.
</P>
<P>
   Savic's latest invention draws on years of sound research and a
long list of other successful machines, including a device used by
Walt Disney to transform voices and a system used by Texaco Inc. to
detect pipeline leaks.
</P>
<P>
   In most of his projects, Savic said the central premise has
stayed the same: come up with the dominant features of the sound
you wish to identify and analyze its patterns.

N.H. PREP SCHOOL AIDS THE NOT-SO-NEEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDITH GAINES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sue Robinson is lounging in her comfortable split-level home in
scenic Topsfield, by the Ipswich River Wildlife Sanctuary. A boat
is in the driveway; a pool and deck in the backyard.
</P>
<P>
   Financial aid forms for her son to attend Phillips Exeter
Academy, in Exeter, N.H., sit in a cabinet inside. They attest to
one luxury that is clearly beyond the family's means.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago, I thought the kind of money we're making
would make us wealthy,'' she says, sipping a glass of iced tea. She
and her husband, Craig, both have good jobs _ she teaches at an
elementary school, he manages facilities for a school district.
Their combined income is nearly $100,000, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they blanched at the thought of sending their son, Craig
Jr., to Exeter, or any private boarding school. Without financial
aid, she says, they could not have afforded tuition and board,
currently $22,725 a year at Exeter.
</P>
<P>
   It's a common story in recent years: middle-class students being
priced out of prep schools, too poor to afford the tuition, too
rich to qualify for aid.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, some private schools have realized that their
campuses lack diversity: There are plenty of rich students, some
low-income students on scholarship, but fewer from the middle
class.
</P>
<P>
   To attract students like Robinson, Exeter has launched a
middle-class financial aid initiative, now starting its fifth year.
The academy is granting as much as 90 percent of tuition to
students from families whose incomes are roughly $60,000 to
$120,000, and in some cases higher.
</P>
<P>
   Although some officials say it's too early to assess the
consequences, others detect improvements in both the quality of
campus life and students' academic performances.
</P>
<P>
   And the academy has found a surprising source of money for this
new pot of aid, which now stands at $28.3 million: former students
whose families were far from financially well-off when they entered
the academy 20 or more years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its image as an elite preparatory school, Exeter has
always tried to serve ``youth from every quarter'' of society, said
Tom Hassan, director of admissions, quoting founder John Phillips.
But particularly after the push for better minority representation
in the 1960s, aid increasingly was targeted to students of limited
means.
</P>
<P>
   They needed a lot of financial help. To offset this expense, the
academy accepted more students who were able to pay full fare.
</P>
<P>
   One result was that the student body experienced ``a barbell
effect.'' Data compiled by alumnus and trustee Rick Smith show that
most students were at either end of the economic spectrum by 1990,
when only 18 percent fell in the middle range _ calculated then at
$40,000 to $80,000 for gross family income.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, campus officials said, they were hearing
a repeated complaint: ``Week after week, year after year, alumni
were saying they'd love to send their children here but couldn't
afford it, even families with two working spouses,'' said Jim
Theisen, director of alumni affairs and development.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Mahoney, director of financial aid, who then chaired the
School Financial Aid Services Committee of the National Association
of Independent Schools, got the same message from other families
and officials at schools around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The middle class was getting squeezed out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The result was not only an awkward gap between rich and poor on
campus, but a situation that could affect the education of
students, Hassan said. ``Students might generalize that all blacks
or minorities were poor, if that's the experience of all the kids
they meet.''
</P>
<P>
   But behind the change were shifting demographic realities.
According to Smith, incomes increased faster than tuition from the
late 1940s until about 1980 _ meaning that the yearly cost of
attending Exeter dropped from 42 &UR;  &LR; to 26 percent of the US median
income from 1950 to 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Then the situation reversed dramatically. Tuitions nearly
doubled from 1980 to 1993, rising more rapidly than inflation or
incomes, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   For families expecting to pay for at least four years of college
for their child, the burden of bills for three or four years of
prep school seemed excessive. ``We're the second $100,000 they had
to come up with,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Exeter officials did not want to decrease aid to students of
more modest means in order to attract the middle- and upper-middle
classes. So they created a new form of aid for families whose gross
total income was $60,000 to $120,000. Then two years ago, the
ceiling was eliminated. The key, officials decided, was a family's
disposable income.
</P>
<P>
   The new fund was created entirely through alumni donations. Many
of the major donors, according to Exeter communications director
Julie Quinn, were a lot like Byron Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Rose, now 56 and living on a ranch in Colorado, had never heard
of preparatory schools before the owner of the Evansville (Ind.)
Courier newspaper asked if he'd like to go away to school. ``The
only kids I knew who went away to school were sent by the courts or
their parents,'' Rose said. ``I didn't give the idea a second
thought.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the 1940s, William Saltonstall, then principal of the
academy, and Hamilton Bissell, director of scholarships, were
determined to make Exeter ``the national high school.'' Seeking
youths with vigor and initiative, they courted newsboys like Rose,
a shy kid who got up at 4 a.m. to deliver newspapers on his
bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   With the offer of a hefty scholarship, Rose was persuaded. The
result, he said, was ``the two best years of education I had
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from Exeter in 1959, went on to Princeton and
Columbia universities, and became an investment banker with
Morgan-Stanley in New York. He retired at age 45 and recently gave
``a six-figure donation'' to Exeter's middle class fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``I benefited from someone else's generosity,'' he said, ``and I
know how hard it can be for middle-class families to send their
children to schools like Exeter.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, 120 of Exeter's 1,000 students are being helped by
this middle-class fund, with an average grant of $12,500, or 55
percent of their tuition and room and board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd be so poor compared to everyone else,'' said
Sarah Pennington, 17, a middle-class aid student now beginning her
senior year at Phillips Exeter. ``But when I got there, I found it
wasn't an issue. You can't really pigeonhole people.''

IN CONNECTICUT, BASEBALL LOYALTIES DIVIDED 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe

<P>
   WATERBURY, Conn. _ The best view of baseball between the New
York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox may be from this quiet corner
of the world, where the ancient rivalry divides the place in half.
</P>
<P>
   On the west side of town, an 11-year-old declares his undying
devotion to New York. Further east, a mall-walking retiree says she
is unquestionably for the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Sports stores diplomatically display pictures from both teams.
Even Mayor Philip Giordano is in on the act.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually kind of weird,'' said Giordano, a Yankees fan.
``I also have friends of mine who live on the east side who are all
Boston Celtics fans, and friends on the west who are New York
Knicks fans.... I wouldn't say they dress any differently. But I
have found it kind of amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether amazing or just a quirky fact of life is a matter of
opinion in this town and throughout the state of Connecticut, where
approximately 3.3 million people live on either side of what is
referred to simply as ``the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Invisible but distinct, it is a modern-day Mason-Dixon line
defined by culture and attitude, one that extends far beyond the
edge of the playing field. There are the symphony wars, separating
classical music lovers who gravitate toward the Boston Symphony
Orchestra from those who swear by Lincoln Center. There are the
college loyalties, dividing generations of Boston University
graduates from devoted alumni of New York University.
</P>
<P>
   Barely a factor in the debate is Connecticut itself. Sandwiched
between the two major Northeast cities, connected by highways that
lead straight to each, the entire state appears at times to
function as one big bedroom community _ a suburban extension of
either metropolis, divided down the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of Connecticut's identity problem,'' said Charles A.
Monagan, editor-in-chief of Connecticut Magazine in Trumbull.
``Part of us wants to be associated with the glitter and drama of
New York City. Another part of us wants to be associated with the
ancient virtues of New England ... We don't have a clam chowder of
our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the line itself has an identity problem. Monagan, a native
of Waterbury, believes it runs ``right down Willow Street.''
Michael P. Peters, the mayor of Hartford, claims it runs through
his city, ``right down Farmington Ave.'' Richard Abele, the City
Council president of Norwich, thinks it is ``around New Haven, that
area.''
</P>
<P>
   But in New Haven, Mayor John DeStefano quickly points elsewhere.
Close enough to Manhattan to describe New Yorkers as ``just better
people,'' he views the division as many residents do: as a fluid
gray zone running from the northwest corner of the state toward the
east, roughly aligned with the border between area codes 860 and
203.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is related to the highways, I think,'' he said.
``A lot of it has to do with where your family came from, where you
went to school.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he insisted, with an air of home-state pride: ``I don't
think we've got an identity crisis. We're in the middle, and it's
the character of our community.''
</P>
<P>
   For politicians, that midpointed trait can require fancy
footwork. Candidates in Fairfield County, as well as those running
statewide campaigns, have found that buying airtime on New York
television stations can make or break an election, according to the
press secretary for the campaign of Governor John G. Rowland. ``It
can make a big difference,'' Dean Pagoni said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the distinction between perceptions of staid New
England and vibrant New York _ an argument older than the baseball
rivalry itself. Struggling to put it diplomatically, Richard Hegel,
the municipal historian of New Haven, suggested that ``maybe New
York stresses the arts more than Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean Boston's not a fun town,'' he added quickly.
``I mean, in no way is Boston not a fun town.''
</P>
<P>
   Businesses in both cities are aware of such distinct convictions
and play off them, appealing to Connecticut residents in magazine
and newspaper advertisements. Kim Noltemy, director of marketing
for the BSO, calls Connecticut an outright target on the mailing
list.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Nunziance, a spokesman for the Boston Office of Special
Events and Tourism, says that the ``Boston Overnight'' campaign _
in which local hotels offered a three-night winter package _ was
also directed in part at residents from the state to the south.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fairly wealthy state in terms of disposable income,''
Nunziance said.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to baseball, however, the customer is already
sold. And it is in this arena that the line appears sharp and
irrefutable, like train tracks demarcating the wrong side of town.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as the Red Sox-Yankees series approached, the
division was palpable in Waterbury, where defenders of both teams
dared to mingle at the Brass Mill Center Mall. Two friends, Carol
Miles and Margaret DiTullio, offered proof of the split: Although
they spend afternoons walking through the mall, they part ways when
it comes to team loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a Yankees fan all my life,'' said Miles, a sales
audit supervisor, shrugging at her misguided friend.
</P>
<P>
   DiTullio, a Red Sox fan, defended her affiliation as evidence of
``individual thinking in Connecticut.'' But nearby at Fans, a
sports memorabilia store, owner Frank Johnson called the situation
a muddled mess.
</P>
<P>
   Seated behind autographed pictures of Nomar Garciaparra and Tino
Martinez _ displayed with equal prominence at the counter _ Johnson
shook his head as he tried to explain the split personality of the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's even more serious here than when you go into a major
city. You mention the wrong team, you take your life into your
hands,'' he said. ``I hate to say it, but I'm a transplant here
from the South. I still don't understand.''

THE LONG-TERM LIABILITY OF PRECIOUS METALS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, September 13, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. In February of 1996 I opened an account in Vanguard's Gold
and Precious Metals fund. I thought of it as a hedge against
declining values in other sectors. I selected this fund because I
endorse Vanguard's philosophy of low cost and team management. I
did expect some volatility in this fund, but I have been quite
dismayed in what has happened. The current value is about half of
my original investment. What has gone wrong? What did I not
understand about volatility in this sector? What should I do? Could
this possibly turn around? Right now it looks as though this fund
is going steadily down through the floor. I guess the days when
people looked to gold and metals as a hedge are over.
</P>
<P>
   D.B., Beverly, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Probably the biggest factor you overlooked when you
researched this investment is that gold and precious metals funds
have historically made horrible long-term investments.
</P>
<P>
   While this very volatile sector can produce some astounding
spurts, such as the dramatic returns in 1993 when the average fund
in the category delivered an 89.15 percent total return, the funds
have usually been pretty quick to give up their big gains. Worse,
the downturns have historically outweighed the spurts. According to
the figures from Morningstar Mutual Funds, the average return for
the category is a loss in all of the time periods they track --
ranging from three months to 15 years. The final figure was a 2.51
percent loss if you held the position for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to me that there are only two situations in which gold
funds are likely to prosper. First and foremost is during times of
high inflation. Second is during times of general political and
economic uncertainty. But even these guideposts don't always point
the right way. Certainly the world has seen plenty of economic
uncertainty during the first eight months of this year -- and there
was your fund at the end of August --off 27.4 percent. But between
that date and Sept. 8 the losses were trimmed to 10.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, your choice of Vanguard's gold fund was fairly
solid. Morningstar ranks it below average, but that's the highest
grade given any fund in the category. Its 10-year record, showing a
2.47 percent loss, compares to a 5.32 percent loss for the average
fund in the category over that period. Morningstar praises the
fund's conservative strategy and low expenses. But the fact remains
it's in a sector that's ill-adapted for long-term investing, and I
have always been unenthusiastic about these funds. If I were you,
I'd take advantage of the slight current improvement in the share
prices and sell.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Our daughters are 25 and 21 years old. Since it seems fairly
clear that young adults today don't have the same shot at ``making
it'' in terms of financial accumulation that our generation has
had, we would like to start transferring some money to them now so
they can open IRAs that will help them accumulate capital for their
future needs -- further education, home ownership, and so forth.
What would you suggest we do for them? I have some experience with
Fidelity funds.
</P>
<P>
   L.D., Chestnut Hill, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I won't get into an argument about whether the next
generation's chances of ``making it'' are inferior to what ours
were, but certainly there's no question that a generous
contributions to children's IRA accounts is a handsome gift and
will give them a nice leg up on the struggle to build financial
security.
</P>
<P>
   But before you can make a good decision about how to invest the
money, you should do some more thinking about its likely purposes.
For example, in a portion of your letter that I edited out, you
suggested one daughter might decide to go to graduate school after
about five years of work. If the money is to be used for this
purpose, you'll want a very cautious investment -- a balanced stock
and bond fund (such as Fidelity Puritan) at the riskiest, and
better yet, a more secure fixed-income fund, ranging from Fidelity
GNMA at the higher end of the risk spectrum to Fidelity Cash
Reserves, where the risk is nearly negligible. Another option for
such an purpose would be Fidelity's Target Timeline 2003 fund,
which is one of several dated fixed-income funds which are designed
for people who expect to withdraw their money at a certain date.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if the greater likelihood is that the money
will be held for many years and will become the spark from which
your daughters' retirement portfolios emerge, you'll want to take
an entirely different approach. By this I mean holding your nose
and putting the money into stock funds. Since you view this as an
ongoing process, if it's to be long-term money you can take the
point of view of the dollar-cost-averaging investor. I would,
however, take notice of the current dangerous market to start them
out in a value- oriented holding such as Fidelity Equity-Income II.
</P>
<P>
   One suggestion that might be appropriate is to tell them that
these gifts have divided purposes -- half for shorter-term needs
such as education or real estate, and the rest to be held for the
long haul. You could then allocate the investments according to
what's appropriate for each segment of the portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 30 years old and my husband, 34, owns a small company
and earns approximately $100,000 a year. We have a seven-month-old
child, and plan to have more children. Our investments include IRAs
consisting of $7,500 in Fidelity Contrafund, $1,600 in Fidelity
Asset Manager Growth, and $4,000 in Fidelity Latin America. We also
have $12,000 in Vanguard Total Stock Market Index and $16,000 in
Vanguard Small-Cap Index. We have $2,500 in Janus Fund, plus $7,500
more in a money market fund which is being transferred to Janus
fund at the rate of $1,000 a month. We have $2,500 in Janus
Worldwide fund. Finally, we have $3,000 in Vanguard's Index Growth
fund in our child's name, and are in the process of transferring a
further $10,000 into this fund at the rate of $200 a month. We also
have $50,000 in savings, of which we would like to put $10,000 in a
CD and invest $35,000. How have I done so far? Is this a good time
to invest in a bond fund, or should we wait until interest rates
rise? What would be a good bond fund? What shall we do with that
$35,000?
</P>
<P>
   A.S., Brighton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. In general, you're doing well, having developed a
well-diversified portfolio. I would like to see a small position in
a health care fund, probably about $5,000, but otherwise it's
nicely rounded.
</P>
<P>
   I am perplexed about your focus on bonds, perhaps because I
don't understand the purpose of the money in question. Is this
$35,000 that you want to invest simply a part of your emergency
savings, on which you are seeking a better return than at the bank?
Or do you think of this as a part of your retirement savings? If
it's the latter case, you're too young to take a big position in
bonds, despite the nervous state of the current market. At the most
cautious, I'd look for a balanced fund such as Vanguard Balanced
Index or Fidelity Puritan.
</P>
<P>
   But I'd be happier if you looked to fairly conservative stock
investments, such as Fidelity Equity-Income II or Vanguard Index
Value or Windsor II. If you make such a move, I suggest 36-month
dollar cost averaging But if you view this as emergency money and
simply want a better return than the bank is now giving you, I
suggest you look to a good money market fund, which should start
you out in the area of 5.25 percent to 5.30 percent, which would
doubtless mean you better returns, without sacrificing liquidity.
</P>
<P>
   One final thing that I don't understand is that you are
establishing your position in Janus Worldwide through a dollar-cost
averaging program of less than a year, while you are stretching out
the investment period for your child's Index Growth account to a
period which should span more than 56 months from now. Why not find
a middle ground -- setting 36 months as the target to be fully
invested in each case? This would mean moving $300 a month to your
child's account and $225 a month to Janus Worldwide.

INVESTMENT CLUB PLANS TO STAND FIRM AGAINST BEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Few of the anguished cries heard on Wall Street during
the stock market's recent swoons have reached the Mothers and
Daughters Investment Club. .
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a buying, not selling, opportunity,'' said Sandra Pasco,
33, a collections agent. ``We were all waiting for a correction.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither did the suburban Boston group feel much of the
exuberance that washed over professional investors earlier this
week ago, when the Dow rallied strongly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had so much volatility in the last weeks,'' sighed Judi
McDonald, 52, Sandra's mother and the club's president. ``It has
almost been like allergy shots _ you kind of get de-sensitized.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a placid stance makes the Braintree club a barometer of how
America's democracy of investors views the market's rollercoaster
rides. The 21-member group is the ultimate practitioner of the
buy-and-hold philosophy that investment strategists say is crucial
to helping keep the US stock market afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Market watchers who have spent this summer of swings parsing
popular sentiment, wondering whether ordinary investors will turn a
bout of volatility like Thursday's 250-point drop into a bear
market of panic selling, would have taken heart at the club's
meeting Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Since its start 2 1/2 years ago, when the bull market was in
full stampede, the club has never dumped a stock.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the women haven't had cause to waver. Since mid-July,
when the Dow first turned south and sparked fears that the bull
market might be ending, the group's nine-stock portfolio has lost
17 percent. But since its start in March 1996, the portfolio has
had a net gain of 38.3 percent, and is now worth about $16,130.
Each member invests $25 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, a 100-point drop would have worried people,''
McDonald said. ``Now, you get a 200-point swing and we don't even
bat an eye.''
</P>
<P>
   In a bland corporate conference room at the South Shore Elder
Center, the women munched raspberry coffee cake and intoned their
sit-tight mantra. &UR;  &LR; ``We're in it for the long haul,'' said Edie
Carter, 54, a dental hygienist.
</P>
<P>
   The club has vowed not to be another Beardstown Ladies, the
Illinois group of endearing grandmothers whose stock picking skills
could not match their baking prowess.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmothers accidentally overestimated their investment
returns. But they also lent a touch of down-home popularity to a
growing investment wave.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Since 1990, when the stock market emerged from a recession,
Americans have snapped up mutual funds and individual stocks,
helping to fuel one of the great bull markets of this century and
making investing a national obsession. One-third of all US
household assets are in stocks, either directly or through funds.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals own a whopping 78 percent of the $5.1 trillion fund
industry, half of which which is invested in corporate shares. Much
of the money is in long-term retirement plans, whose owners, at
least for now, would prefer to sit out a downturn than cash out
quickly at a loss.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the boom, investment clubs have proliferated. A modern
version of quilting bees and poker games that blends money
management talk with old-fashioned socializing, the clubs are
congregations of stock market disciples. Some are deadly serious,
playing with big sums. Others, like Mothers and Daughters, are more
of a trial-and-error experiment.
</P>
<P>
   While some observers are skeptical that ordinary investors can
outpick the professionals over the long run, many clubs have indeed
done well. Over 58 percent of all registered clubs outperformed the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index last year, compared to only 10.5
percent of professionally managed US stock mutual funds, according
to the National Association of Investors Corp., a Michigan umbrella
group whose 700,000 club members have $3.3 billion invested in
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more tellingly, many clubs seem to embody an investing
approach that shuns spur-of-the-moment selling in favor of riding
out the bumps. ``The average investor may not be more sophisticated
these days, but he is more knowledgable,'' said Robert O'Hara,
NAIC's vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Market watchers only recently concluded that individual
investors generally hold onto their US stocks when Wall Street
gyrates, thus helping to buffer against a free fall and
counterbalancing a sell-off by more skittish institutional
investors. Small investors who sat tight are credited with having
kept last October's 7 percent plunge from becoming a bigger
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   The big question is whether a protracted downturn will spur a
popular sell-off. The average investment club holds onto its stocks
for a long 8 1/2 years, O'Hara said. But he added that if the Dow
continues to fall over several months, ``people will get scared.''
</P>
<P>
   While practicing the sit-tight philosophy that investment
advisers have preached for years, the Braintree group has learned
concepts that only a few years ago were the exclusive domain of
professional money managers.
</P>
<P>
   Terms like price-earnings ratios, beta, and cash flow peppered
the women's conversation during the club's three-hour meeting. In a
season of Monica Lewinsky, plane crashes and bombings, Russia's
meltdown, and global financial worries, the club has concentrated
with devotional intensity on how to gauge a stock's value.
</P>
<P>
   ``Total Systems' p/e is at 51,'' warned 31-year-old Beth
Higgins, McDonald's other daughter, who, like her mother and sister
Sandra, is a collections agent. She was referring to a common
messure of a stock's value.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The room gasped.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, if the club analyzed companies as extensively as it
discussed potential new members, it might rival legendary Fidelity
stockpicker Peter Lynch for returns. But the Mothers and Daughters
portfolio, a sort of Magellan of Main Street, views the social
aspects of the club _ and learning about investing _ as more
important than profits.
</P>
<P>
   In an exercise treated by less savvy members as a
color-by-numbers activity, the women pencilled in figures on
stock-analysis worksheets provided by the NAIC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education is the biggest criteria here _ at our first meeting,
nobody even knew what the Dow Jones industrial average was,'' said
Lora Ettridge, 57, a psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   The rank-and-file blue chips favored by many investors these
days are absent from the club's quirky portfolio of mostly midsized
companies. The group, with sights on above-average annual returns
of 15 percent, owns insurer AFLAC, surgical goods maker Biomet,
pharmacy chain CVS, Century Telephone, homes builder Clayton Homes,
software outfit Parametric Technologies, office retailer Staples,
credit processor Total Systems, and Wendy's International, the
burger chain.
</P>
<P>
   For balance, the women wanted not the ultrasafe bonds or cash
they might have turned to had their life savings been at stake, but
a small-company stock. Making the cut at the meeting was jam maker
JM Smucker. After a presentation by Pasco, who consulted investment
advisory data from Value Line Publications, an annual report, and
personal finance magazines, and then compared the stock to Ben &AMP;
Jerry's, among others, the group voted to buy 50 shares at $22.25
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   For their personal portfolios, many women have put into practice
habits learned through the club. Pasco said she got more aggressive
with her husband's corporate retirement plan, opting for riskier
but potentially higher returning stock funds. But significantly,
some members' individual investing habits can be less rational _
and just as telling _ than those used for the club portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Only moments after asserting she could wait out any eight-year
recession, Pasco, the deacon of the club's buy-and-hold creed,
confessed to considering dumping her 100 shares of Culp, an
industrial fabrics manufacturer. The stock has lost two-thirds of
its value since last October. ``I'm just mad at it,'' Pasco said.
And Ettridge said she was thinking of canceling an upcoming meeting
with her personal financial planner. ``I'm not quite sure I want to
hear what the market has done to my mutual funds,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That, too, is sentiment market watchers are keen to detect _
especially since many individual stocks this year are slowed more
than the S&AMP;P 500, the broadest market measure. The index is up 1
percent for the year, but the median S&AMP;P stock is down 10.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for yet another measure, albeit symbolic, of Main
Street's view of Wall Street, observers might take note of a raffle
prize handed out at the end of the Mothers and Daughters meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Presenting a peach-scented candle in a glass holder to Barbara
Tirrell, McDonald said, ``I think we needed a little serenity in
this market.''

MATT DAMON TAKES THE CAKE IN `ROUNDERS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You're going to hear a lot about the good job Edward Norton and
Gretchen Mol do in ``Rounders.'' But the movie lives and dies with
Matt Damon.
</P>
<P>
   As he did in ``Good Will Hunting,'' Damon plays a brilliant man
torn between academia and the streets, in this case law school and
New York's underground world of high-stakes poker.
</P>
<P>
   Damon, as Mike McDermott, is drawn away from his law studies and
a longtime girlfriend by loyalty to a childhood friend and the
sleazy romance of big-money card games. Norton as Worm, a loser pal
to end all loser pals, and Mol, playing the girlfriend, deliver
solid, believable performances.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, the script doesn't show you much commitment from
McDermott _ to either law school or his girlfriend _ so you've got
to take his word for it. Given Damon's boyish smile and God's-truth
way of talking, that's easy to do.
</P>
<P>
   Remember his monologue before the final battle in ``Saving
Private Ryan'' _ sitting on clumps of rubble, talking about
catching his brother in a hayloft with a woman ``who fell out of
the ugly tree and caught every branch on the way down?''
</P>
<P>
   There was something bogus about his description of the fire and
fracas that followed, but because of his smile, because of
something he did with his eyes, you gave him the benefit of the
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   You'll have to do that again, if ``Rounders'' is going to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rounders,'' a rawer, raunchier update of Steve McQueen's
``Cincinnati Kid,'' starts rolling when McDermott meets Worm
outside the gates of state prison, where Worm has been languishing
for running a scam. Because the two were like brothers growing up,
because Worm never ratted on him when he went to prison, McDermott
is loyal to his pal in spite of every weird, wasted episode of
their Odyssey through layers of cheap poker clubs and cheaper
people.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Worm runs up a $7,000 debt in McDermott's name, even
after he's caught cheating in games against suckers who don't need
to be hustled, even after he badgers and insults a hood he owes
$25,000, McDermott stands by Worm, losing his girlfriend and a plum
law clerk job in the process. It's right about here where serious
suspension of disbelief has to kick in.
</P>
<P>
   Norton will be praised for his portrayal of Worm, an
on-the-edge, crooked-smile scam man with a broken past. But it's
not hard to play a loser with no real depth, a man who cheats on
his friends and takes beatings as his natural lot in life. Mol, as
Jo, is beautiful to look at and hits the notes of betrayal exactly
right. But in the end she's just window dressing.
</P>
<P>
   John Malkovich, as cash-fat, low-class card tycoon Teddy KGB,
comes dangerously close to cartoon-land with his Russian accent and
air-grabbing mannerisms. Michael Rispoli, as the loan shark Grama,
is a cartoon _ his bloated threats and rank, staggering scenes with
dark-eyed, emaciated women are cliched. John Turturro as the
world-weary Joey Knish is pushed to the background, leaving only
Martin Landau, as Professor Petrovsky, to give ``Rounders'' the
kind of dignity it needs if it's going to be believed.
</P>
<P>
   In some honestly moving scenes with McDermott, Landau talks
about the gift of life he received from his mother after escaping
the death camps of World War II. He passes that gift on to his law
student in the form of $10,000 up-front money for one last two-man
poker game between McDermott and Teddy KGB. It's a windmill-tilt at
$25,000 to keep McDermott and Worm out of Grama's hands _ one day
after McDermott has dumped his pal, begging the question, ``Why
here? Why now?''
</P>
<P>
   Suspension of disbelief has to kick in again and again over the
final scenes, especially when McDermott _ who makes his living
knowing every facial tick of people across the table _ stumbles on
a Teddy KGB mannerism that's as obvious as a scream, and has been
obvious from the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rounders'' also suffers from a misguided attempt to wrap up
all loose ends. But the dignity of Landau's scenes carry over, in
some strange way, to the closing showdown and in spite of how hard
everything is to believe, you believe what Damon is doing.
</P>
<P>
   Just as you did in ``Saving Private Ryan,'' just as you did in
``Good Will Hunting.''

IN CONNECTICUT, BASEBALL LOYALTIES DIVIDED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATERBURY, Conn. _ The best view of baseball between the New
York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox may be from this quiet corner
of the world, where the ancient rivalry divides the place in half.
</P>
<P>
   On the west side of town, an 11-year-old declares his undying
devotion to New York. Further east, a mall-walking retiree says she
is unquestionably for the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Sports stores diplomatically display pictures from both teams.
Even Mayor Philip Giordano is in on the act.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually kind of weird,'' said Giordano, a Yankees fan.
``I also have friends of mine who live on the east side who are all
Boston Celtics fans, and friends on the west who are New York
Knicks fans.... I wouldn't say they dress any differently. But I
have found it kind of amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether amazing or just a quirky fact of life is a matter of
opinion in this town and throughout the state of Connecticut, where
approximately 3.3 million people live on either side of what is
referred to simply as ``the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Invisible but distinct, it is a modern-day Mason-Dixon line
defined by culture and attitude, one that extends far beyond the
edge of the playing field. There are the symphony wars, separating
classical music lovers who gravitate toward the Boston Symphony
Orchestra from those who swear by Lincoln Center. There are the
college loyalties, dividing generations of Boston University
graduates from devoted alumni of New York University.
</P>
<P>
   Barely a factor in the debate is Connecticut itself. Sandwiched
between the two major Northeast cities, connected by highways that
lead straight to each, the entire state appears at times to
function as one big bedroom community _ a suburban extension of
either metropolis, divided down the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of Connecticut's identity problem,'' said Charles A.
Monagan, editor-in-chief of Connecticut Magazine in Trumbull.
``Part of us wants to be associated with the glitter and drama of
New York City. Another part of us wants to be associated with the
ancient virtues of New England ... We don't have a clam chowder of
our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the line itself has an identity problem. Monagan, a native
of Waterbury, believes it runs ``right down Willow Street.''
Michael P. Peters, the mayor of Hartford, claims it runs through
his city, ``right down Farmington Ave.'' Richard Abele, the City
Council president of Norwich, thinks it is ``around New Haven, that
area.''
</P>
<P>
   But in New Haven, Mayor John DeStefano quickly points elsewhere.
Close enough to Manhattan to describe New Yorkers as ``just better
people,'' he views the division as many residents do: as a fluid
gray zone running from the northwest corner of the state toward the
east, roughly aligned with the border between area codes 860 and
203.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is related to the highways, I think,'' he said.
``A lot of it has to do with where your family came from, where you
went to school.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he insisted, with an air of home-state pride: ``I don't
think we've got an identity crisis. We're in the middle, and it's
the character of our community.''
</P>
<P>
   For politicians, that midpointed trait can require fancy
footwork. Candidates in Fairfield County, as well as those running
statewide campaigns, have found that buying airtime on New York
television stations can make or break an election, according to the
press secretary for the campaign of Governor John G. Rowland. ``It
can make a big difference,'' Dean Pagoni said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the distinction between perceptions of staid New
England and vibrant New York _ an argument older than the baseball
rivalry itself. Struggling to put it diplomatically, Richard Hegel,
the municipal historian of New Haven, suggested that ``maybe New
York stresses the arts more than Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean Boston's not a fun town,'' he added quickly.
``I mean, in no way is Boston not a fun town.''
</P>
<P>
   Businesses in both cities are aware of such distinct convictions
and play off them, appealing to Connecticut residents in magazine
and newspaper advertisements. Kim Noltemy, director of marketing
for the BSO, calls Connecticut an outright target on the mailing
list.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Nunziance, a spokesman for the Boston Office of Special
Events and Tourism, says that the ``Boston Overnight'' campaign _
in which local hotels offered a three-night winter package _ was
also directed in part at residents from the state to the south.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fairly wealthy state in terms of disposable income,''
Nunziance said.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to baseball, however, the customer is already
sold. And it is in this arena that the line appears sharp and
irrefutable, like train tracks demarcating the wrong side of town.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as the Red Sox-Yankees series approached, the
division was palpable in Waterbury, where defenders of both teams
dared to mingle at the Brass Mill Center Mall. Two friends, Carol
Miles and Margaret DiTullio, offered proof of the split: Although
they spend afternoons walking through the mall, they part ways when
it comes to team loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a Yankees fan all my life,'' said Miles, a sales
audit supervisor, shrugging at her misguided friend.
</P>
<P>
   DiTullio, a Red Sox fan, defended her affiliation as evidence of
``individual thinking in Connecticut.'' But nearby at Fans, a
sports memorabilia store, owner Frank Johnson called the situation
a muddled mess.
</P>
<P>
   Seated behind autographed pictures of Nomar Garciaparra and Tino
Martinez _ displayed with equal prominence at the counter _ Johnson
shook his head as he tried to explain the split personality of the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's even more serious here than when you go into a major
city. You mention the wrong team, you take your life into your
hands,'' he said. ``I hate to say it, but I'm a transplant here
from the South. I still don't understand.''

THE DEMONIZATION OF TWO BLACK BOYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Semen on a dress may cause President Clinton to lose his office.
Semen on a dress on the South Side of Chicago should cause us to
rethink juvenile justice before the nation loses its mind.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, two boys, aged 7 and 8, were arrested for killing
11-year-old Ryan Harris for her bicycle. The boys allegedly threw a
rock to knock her off her bike, then suffocated her by stuffing
tree leaves up her nose and her panties in her mouth. Last week,
the crime lab found semen on the girl's dress. Improbable as it was
that the young boys could have produced it, the murder charges were
dismissed immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The outcry was swift. The boys were African-American. No one
could imagine white suburban boys being so crudely treated. When
they were arrested and ``confessed,'' the boys were asked to waive
their right to remain silent or to have a lawyer. No parents were
allowed to witness the interrogation. No other child advocate, such
as a psychiatrist, was present.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of the 7-year-old said the Chicago Police Department
``didn't give these boys a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   R. Eugene Pincham, a retired Illinois appellate judge who helped
represent the 8-year-old boy, said, ``It's frightening, really,
that if a police officer would do this to two children, what would
he do to me?''
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Ferguson, a public defender for the 7-year-old, said,
``In a white middle class community, parents would have broken down
the door and said, `Let me in there!'''
</P>
<P>
   What Ferguson did not add was that the father and mother of a
black 7-year-old, respectively a fast-food chef who works 10-hour
shifts, and a chef supervisor at a fast-food restaurant, were crazy
enough to think they could storm a police station with reasonable
hope of coming back out alive.
</P>
<P>
   What was most frightening about the Chicago case is the depth of
corruption caused by a decade of screaming headlines about youth
violence, a prejudice inspired by perjoratives like
``superpredators'' and ``maggots'' and an urge so strong to connect
urban black youth to gang membership, drug use and general
depravity that society no longer questions gestapo tactics, even on
children who have not outgrown Sesame Street.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, nearly all 50 states have changed their
laws to make it easier to prosecute children as adults. One
politician in Texas has proposed making 11-year-olds eligible for
the death penalty. Republican Senators Orrin Hatch of Utah and Jeff
Sessions of Alabama are pushing for a federal juvenile crime bill
that would erode the rights of youths and lower to 14 the age they
could be tried as adults for violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our juvenile crime problem has taken a new and sinister
direction,'' Hatch said this year. Never mind that youth murders,
which did rise horribly from 800 in 1984 to 3,000 in 1994 have
actually decreased by 30 percent in the last three years. Never
mind that the evidence is mounting that sending juvenile offenders
to adult facilities makes them worse rather than reforms them.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 study of 5,476 Florida juvenile offenders found that of
those who were tried as adults, 30 percent were rearrested,
compared to 19 percent who came out of juvenile system. In a study
of juvenile offenders in New York and New Jersey, those treated as
adults were 29 percent more likely to be rearrested. Both studies
found that juveniles who were treated as adults were more likely to
be rearrested for violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Research has also found that youth sent to adult jails are much
more likely to be sexually assaulted, beaten, and attacked with a
weapon than if they were sent to juvenile facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The rhetoric of punishment remains so heated in the face of its
failure (as opposed to prevention or drug treatment), it raises the
question of ulterior racial motives. There is no doubt that many
low-income African-American neighborhoods have crime problems that
need addressing. But when African-American youth, who account for
26 percent of juvenile arrests, make up 52 percent of juveniles who
are tried as adults, something is wrong. When research shows that
these juveniles are likely to become worse human beings than if
they were treated as children, then one has to ask if these youth
have been consigned to the social shredder.
</P>
<P>
   That is what makes this case so dangerous. Chicago police
announced this week that they are reviewing how they treat juvenile
offenders. That is only one small step forward. Black youth are so
criminalized that America now treats second- and third-grade
children like Timothy McVeigh. Without the semen on the dress, the
two boys would not have had a chance. They were too young and too
short to turn off the shredder.

POTENTIAL FOR SUBURBAN SATIRE LOST ON `LIVING'

   ``Living in Captivity'' is a full-bodied goof on America's
beloved suburban neighborhood, where people wake up, as David Byrne
prophesied in ``Once in a Lifetime,'' and ask themselves: ``How did
I get here?'' It contains a handful of smart, ripe concepts: the
enforced intimacy and visual monotony of a gated community in
Southern California; what happens when a black couple moves
nextdoor to a bigot with a black lawn jockey in front of his house;
the fickle hipocrisies of an uptight, politically correct couple.
Woodlawn Heights is a newly painted, freshly mowed, carefully
guarded microcosm.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, despite its potential for sharp social satire, ``Living
in Captivity'' ends up looking like those bottom-feeding,
sex-pandering comedies that rely too heavily on a garish laugh
track. It is brash and uneven, and unable to deal satisfyingly with
the Archie Bunker-meets-Left Coast situation it has set up. Three
episodes were sent to critics for review, and to be sure the worst
of them is tonight's pilot, which has Curtis and Tamara Cook moving
to Woodland Heights unaware they're the only blacks in the
development (yeah, right). Before you can say ``Cup of sugar,''
their gold-chain-wearing bigot of a neighbor, Carmine, accuses
Curtis of stealing his barbecue (in addition to bringing down his
property values). Meanwhile, the Cooks' other neighbors, Will and
Becca Marek, ponder whether the proper phrase is ``black'' or
``African-American.'' And Will has a passion for jogging ahead of
Curtis, to re-live the time he was robbed by a black man at an ATM
machine.
</P>
<P>
   This could all be piquant material about diversity outside of
the American cities _ the prefab melting pot _ except that the
humor too often disolves into unsophisticated and lewd gags.
Nothing much comes of the racial tensions, anyway, and by next
week's episode all the neighbors are hanging out together
exchanging intimate information about their sex lives. Indeed, the
show is destined to be dogged by a logical problem: establishing
that the neighbors have contempt for one another, then continually
throwing them together for more adventures in wacky sitcom fun.
</P>
<P>
   The sex episode has all the neighbors rushing out of their
houses after an earthquake. Carmine is not wearing pants, and when
he puts on the apron his kittenish wife was wearing for their
lovemaking, Curtis tells him he looks like ``the cigarette boy at a
gay bar.'' But Carmine is not wounded, since his neighbors now seem
to envy his sexual prowess (Becca even calls his name out at an
inappropriate moment). It's all pretty stock material, and
especially disappointing since ``Living in Captivity'' is produced
by Diane English and Joel Shukovsky, the team behind the more adult
``Murphy Brown.'' The following episode is a slight improvement, as
the Woodlaw Heights community responds in fear to a burgulary,
putting the blame on the security guard, who has one of the show's
few sly moments as he testifies like a guilt-ridden politician
before the neighborhood senate.

HARDY'S `TESS' SURVIVES A&AMP;E 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLES 
Starring: Justine Waddell, Jason Flemyng, Oliver Milburn 
Directed by: Ian Sharp 
On: A&AMP;E 
Time: Sunday and Monday nights at 9 
Rated: TVPG 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's no denying it, Thomas Hardy was a great storyteller.
Fate wreaks havoc on his simple characters, and we feel their
oppression and gloom, their unlucky coincidence, their tragedy.
Like giant game players, Society ruins them and Nature heals them,
only so that Death and Shame can destroy them. It's somber, and
universal, and irresistible. And so even a problematic Hardy
adaptation like A&AMP;E's new ``Tess of the D'Urbervilles'' is bound to
engage our interest, especially when it's got enough doomed romance
and tears of resignation to float ``Titanic.'' Miscast, tonally
uneven, and inferior (although similar) to Roman Polanski's 1980
``Tess,'' the A&AMP;E two-parter nonetheless captures enough Hardy
magic to provide nearly 4 hours of adequate drama.
</P>
<P>
   One of the problems of the production, which airs Sunday and
Monday nights at 9, is the casting of newcomer Justine Waddell as
Tess. She gives her heroine a pouty, feisty manner that is
particularly out of place early in the movie, when she's a poor,
innocent 16-year-old sent to work for a man believed to be a
wealthy cousin, Alec. At moments, she bears a strange and
inappropriate resemblance to Gloria Grahame as the girl who
``cain't say no'' in ``Oklahoma.'' It took me an hour or two to
adjust to her interpretation. As Alec, Jason Flemyng does his best
Vincent Price, forcing himself on Tess after spinning a web of
seduction around her. Flemyng has done some subtle work in movies
like ``Hollow Reed'' and ``Alive and Kicking,'' but here he seems
to be telegraphing his villainy, in case we can't tell that he's a
bad guy. Like Waddell, he blends into the story more smoothly in
part two.
</P>
<P>
   The plot continues to unravel with Hardy's bleak touch: Tess is
pregnant by Alec, but after she returns to her family home the
infant boy dies. She begins a new life at a dairy farm, where she
finds love among the udders with Angel Clare, a noble man who
doesn't cope well when he learns about her past. But these
developments are punctuated by a condescending, Disneyesque
voiceover narration that chronicles Tess's movements as though she
were the pets in ``The Incredible Journey.'' Gradually, these
intrusions detract from the story's potency, giving it a fairy-tale
quality that diminishes its scope. It's an unfortunate misstep.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;E's ``Tess of the D'Urbervilles'' is a glorious-looking film
filled with English country settings bathed in golden light. It's
only when we are given a look at a sky filled with suspiciously
bright stars, which flicker like a flashlight behind a piece of
black construction paper, that the visual spell is broken.

PLOT MARS THE REAL FUN IN `LET'S TALK ABOUT SEX' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
LET'S TALK ABOUT SEX 
Written and directed by: Troy Beyer 
Starring: Troy Beyer, Paget Brewster, Randi Ingerman, Joseph C.
Phillips, Michaline Babich, Tina Nguyen 
Running time: 82 minutes 
Rated: R (Frank sexual discussions, nudity, profanity) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Let's Talk About Sex'' is a film with a split personality _
one very good, one very bad.
</P>
<P>
   First, the good. Troy Beyer's directorial debut features
conversations with real women talking, at times in startlingly
graphic detail, about sex and relationships in the '90s. Their
observations are bawdy, raw, hilarious, poignant, and sound exactly
like the kinds of comments women make when their romantic partners
_ male or female _ aren't around.
</P>
<P>
   If only Beyer had left well enough alone. Instead, she makes
these cinema verite moments the backdrop for a trite story of three
friends searching for love in Miami's South Beach. It's rife with
melodramatic subplotsthat add nothing to the main story. The longer
the film goes on, the more apparent it becomes that the sex-talk
vignettes are there to fill the holes in Beyer's sorely lacking
script. Who needs a plot when you can have women talking about oral
sex?
</P>
<P>
   Beyer's Jazz is an advice columnist for a Miami newspaper, a job
she desperately wants to leave. She gets an idea for a talk show
called ``Girltalk'' _ hey, there's an inventive name _ wherein
women would sit around talking about love and sex. Before she can
convince a station to give her a shot, she has to create a
presentation tape offering a taste of what the show would be like.
She recruits her two best galpals, Michelle (Paget Brewster) and
Lena, (Randi Ingerman) to accompany her through the sun-drenched
streets to interview willing women about what they like and don't
like sexually.
</P>
<P>
   From bad dates to booty calls, the women let it all hang out.
These segments are largely unscripted, and Beyer should have tossed
out her dusty screenplay and just made a documentary about women's
sexual attitudes. But she's too intent on trying to make a story
about Jazz, Michelle, and Lena.
</P>
<P>
   Let it be said that Beyer, Brewster, and Ingerman are all
absolute stunners whose perfectly toned bodies never met a cropped
top they didn't they like. Hence, not for one moment can you ever
believe their characters could have any difficulty finding steady,
willing boyfriends. Women who look like this aren't single unless
they want to be.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, we have to wade through the romantic woe of Jazz
who has recently dumped her longtime boyfriend, Michael (Joseph C.
Phillips), for reasons that, when revealed, just don't pack the
punch Beyer clearly intended. Then there's Michelle, who eats men
for breakfast as a way of hiding her own insecurities. On the other
hand, Lena allows herself to be used by men who never want anything
more than a roll in the hay.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in the middle of this tired little mess there's
probably interesting film, but you won't find it here. Beyer also
wrote the lowbrow 1997 comedy, ``B.A.P.S,'' and while it was far
from great, the film had its moments of skanky charm. ``Let's Talk
About Sex'' has no such luck, but it manages a pretty mean feat _
it makes a film about sex unconscionably boring.

   When you have precious, sensitive cargo that absolutely,
positively has to get to its destination safely and in a hurry,
call on Starr's Federal Investigative Express!
</P>
<P>
   That's right, Starr's Federal Investigative Express, for all
your publicity-stunt needs. Clad in crisp uniforms and packing
enough heat to overpower a small government, Kenneth Starr's
friends with the Capitol Hill police will carefully, lovingly pack
your top-secret findings in sturdy cardboard boxes and then load
them into sergeant-at-arms vans, where the info will be whisked
straight to the steps of the U.S. Capitol. Perfect for a photo op!
</P>
<P>
   Oh well. So much for Mark McGwire's attempts to distract us from
the madness in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   After a four-year investigation that exhausted even the wonkiest
of Washington insiders and exasperated most of the nation, Kenneth
Starr _ the Captain Queeg of our times _ has finally completed his
witch-hunt, I mean, probe, into the Whitewater land deal.
</P>
<P>
   That's what this is about, right? Whitewater? At least that's
where it started _ but somehow we all ended up talking about
stained dresses and secret-message neckties and Walt Whitman's
poetry and the legal definitions of groping, fondling and heavy
petting.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about the new novels from Tom Wolfe and John Updike. The
most hotly anticipated title of the fall season is ``Behind Closed
Doors,'' the 18-volume report from Starr's office that supposedly
contains the salacious and shocking details of presidential
behavior so morally grotesque and legally questionable it will be
the foundation for impeachment hearings or even the second U.S.
presidential resignation in history.
</P>
<P>
   As I write this, details of the report's release are still being
worked out. Who will be the first to read it? Who will be the first
to highlight the dirty parts so the rest of us don't have to slog
through thousands of pages of legalese?
</P>
<P>
   One thing we know for sure: Oprah Winfrey has no plans to make
Starr's report the next selection of her Book-of-the-Month club.
Whew.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't read one sentence of the report, but I'm sure it
contains meticulously gathered evidence that Clinton engaged in a
sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky, and then lied or at least
finessed the truth when asked under oath about the nature of his
dealings with the former intern. And to that I say: So what.
</P>
<P>
   This investigation should have been called to a halt months ago.
There is absolutely no basis for impeachment, there will never be
any impeachment hearings, and Bill Clinton ain't going to resign. A
year from now this will all be a distant, embarrassing memory for
everyone involved.
</P>
<P>
   Right about now, the Clinton-bashers among you are angrily
reaching for pen and paper _ or, more likely, logging onto your
E-mail system so you can instantly send me a nasty missive.
</P>
<P>
   Let me save you the trouble. Here's what you're going to say:
</P>
<P>
   ``You liberal media elite types just don't get it, do you? This
isn't about Clinton's personal life, it's about the president of
the United States lying under oath! It's about perjury, obstruction
of justice, tampering with potential witnesses, blatant abuse of
the office of the presidency!''
</P>
<P>
   No, the Iran-Contra hearings were about all those things and
more. This is about an independent counsel investigation run amok.
</P>
<P>
   Starr was allowed to bring the Monica matter into play because
of the civil lawsuit, since dismissed, filed by Paula Jones.
Clinton's relationship with Lewinsky would help to establish a
pattern of harassment, according to attorneys for Ms. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   So when asked about Lewinsky, Clinton lied. Or at least, he
hemmed and hawed and used legally acceptable terms to fudge the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   Is that perjury? Sure. And if we pursued perjury charges against
every man and woman who has lied under oath during civil
proceedings such as divorce trials and harassment claims, there
would be tens of thousands of such cases clogging up the
courtrooms.
</P>
<P>
   After insulting the nation with his half-hearted non-apology a
few weeks ago, Clinton has gone to great lengths to make amends,
with at least three mea culpas, each one more direct than the last.
What's he supposed to do next, order 280 million of those cutesy
Shoebox greeting cards and pen a personalized apology to every man,
woman and child in the country?
</P>
<P>
   The president of the United States is a leering cad who lied to
everyone, including the independent counsel, about a pathetic
affair with a woman half his age. We all know this. If he had lied
about trading arms for hostages, or bombings in Vietnam, that would
be a different matter.
</P>
<P>
   But we're talking about sex, lies and audiotape here. That
Clinton didn't immediately confess a stupid affair with a stupid
young girl is hardly grounds for impeachment or resignation, at
least not in a rational world.

MATT DAMON PUTS ON A CONVINCING POKER FACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
ROUNDERS 
Directed by: John Dahl 
Screenplay by: David Levien &AMP; Brian Koppelman 
Starring: Matt Damon, Edward Norton, John Turturro, Famke Janssen,
Gretchen Mol, John Malkovich, Martin Landau 
Running time: 121 minutes 
Rated: R (pervasive strong language, some sexuality, and drug use) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Rounders'' is another juicy Matt Damon movie, sliding him into
the darkly vicarious world of high-stakes poker in the kind of
dark, thick-walled caves where nobody bothers sharing the winnings
with the IRS. The winnings, naturally, include the pumped-up
testosterone levels that come of identifying one's manhood with an
ability to stay cool, outpsych your opponents, and win the game.
Damon's poker wizard is one notch down on the wunderkind scale from
his math genius in ``Good Will Hutning.'' But he convinces us he
knows his stuff.
</P>
<P>
   To Damon's Mike McDermott, poker isn't about luck. It's about
skill, knowing how to calculate which cards are where, and, above
all, how to play the mind games that make the difference. Not for
him the safe plays that mark the slow, steady, enduring veteran
drolly underplayed by John Turturro. Once the cards are cut, we
don't for a moment believe he's gone cold turkey on the game in
order to pursue law school and a straight life on the yuppie career
express with go-getter Gretchen Mol.
</P>
<P>
   She sees them as a legal power couple to be. But we share his
relief when he's obliged to go back to the house of cards to save
the life of Worm, Edward Norton's death-wish-flaunting lifelong
buddy. Worm does his best to sink them both with dumb bravado and
dumber plays, but he was a standup guy who could have dragged Mike
to prison with him and didn't. Now he's out and Mike owes him, so
the film literally and figuratively starts dealing and we settle
back in pleasurable anticipation as it goes about its ante-upping
business.
</P>
<P>
   John Dahl, who directed ``Red Rock West'' and ``The Last
Seduction,'' has a way with underbelly environments, and he's right
at home here in an in-your-face way. The flavorful support includes
John Malkovich's over-the-top Russian mafia high roller, Martin
Landau's unworldly law school dean and Mike's unofficial rabbi, and
Famke Janssen's stereotype-demolishing working girl, the
gambling-world belle Mike could enjoy if he tired of Mol's golden
girl. But mostly the film cashes in on the play of expressions on
Damon's face and the feeling that we can see the wheels turning
inside his head.
</P>
<P>
   It's a face ready-made to serve as a map of internal conflict _
sharp, intelligent eyes in a fleshy face on its way to settling
into what it's finally going to look like. Damon's face speaks of a
young man's energies and moral choices still in process. This is
why he's such an arresting actor at this stage of his development.
He's smart, handsome, witty, playful, not above running a con. But
above all, his face tells us he's a guy who hasn't made his mind up
yet. We can't take our eyes off the pitched battle between decency
and ruthlessness played out on his sentient features.
</P>
<P>
   Like its zigzagging characters, ``Rounders'' moves in fits and
starts. But there's a comforting reassurance in the very
familiarity of the film's genre moves. They amount to ritualized
macho choreography, which Damon colors with believable street savvy
and stubborn pride, whether fleecing preppy suckers in their clubby
suburban enclaves or literally plunging into the pit to extricate
his pal. ``Rounders'' moves in fits and starts. But it's the best
showdown-across-a-card-table movie since ``The Cincinnati Kid'' and
it deals the new season a winning hand.

VERVE OF `SIMON BIRCH' DISARMS DOUBT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
SIMON BIRCH 
Directed by: Mark Steven Johnson 
Screenplay by: Johnson, suggested by John Irving's novel, ``A
Prayer for Owen Meany'' 
Starring: Ian Michael Smith, Joseph Mazzello, Ashley Judd, Oliver
Platt, David Straithairn, Dana Ivey, Beatrice Winde 
Running time: 110 minutes 
Rated: PG (language, emotional thematic elements, and an accident
scene) 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a certain advantage to low expectations. Hopes were not
high for ``Simon Birch,'' Mark Steven Johnson's adaptation of John
Irving's 1989 novel, ``A Prayer for Owen Meany,'' after Irving
distanced himself from the film and called for a name change. But
``Simon Birch'' turns out to be a sweet, golden-hued evocation of
an affecting friendship between two 12-year-old boys linked by
their misfit status. The chief reason it works is the dry, wry
performance of Ian Michael Smith in the title role of the
diminutive boy who is unflinching about his limited life span, but
who believes nevertheless that God has a plan for him.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine moviegoers remaining untouched by Smith's
performance, not because he actually has the bone-stunting disorder
known as Morquio's Syndrome, but because he refuses to exploit it
for pathos or sentimentality in even the smallest way. Not
surprisingly, the boy with the smallest body in his New England
town is revealed to have the biggest spirit. His brightness and
boldness are the film's motors; his anti-authoritarian spirit and
venturesomeness loft him beyond the cruel treatment of his
classmates and the callous ostracism he experiences at the hands of
his own parents.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not all Simon. Joseph Mazzello musters equal presence
as Simon's pal and fellow outcast, Joe, who's physically normal,
but who he was born out of wedlock in a very small town in the
1950s, and is made to suffer because of it. Making things tougher
is the fact that his mother, played by Ashley Judd, refuses to
divulge the father's name. But she's so warm and radiant and
loving, with affection left over for the love-starved Simon, that
she not only can be forgiven, but regarded as possibly wise in the
long run.
</P>
<P>
   The boys draw strength from one another, and from Joe's mother's
suitor, the liberal high school drama teacher played by Oliver
Platt. Otherwise, the town is pretty much arrayed against them,
especially David Straithairn's clenched minister, who regards Simon
as a disruptive influence, which he is, but for the right reasons.
At one point, Simon triggers a sequence of events that turns the
school's Christmas pageant into a shambles. The ongoing search for
the identity of Joe's real father gets them into more trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But more seriously fateful events occur. A climactic Vietnam
incident in the novel is replaced with something local and
unfortunately reminiscent of an acclaimed arthouse hit from last
year. The other is a freak accident involving Judd's idealized mom.
They force the boys to grow up a little faster, and frankly, more
simplistically and without the jagged outcroppings of eccentricity
that were part of what made the novel so enjoyable. But if ``Simon
Birch'' exchanges texture for glossiness, it's also surprisingly
potent. It'll grab you if you give it half a chance, from Smith's
dry-eyed spunkiness to Jim Carrey's grown-up Joe. Don't write
``Simon Birch'' off.

HARVEY DANGER WRITES ITS OWN SUCCESS STORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Harvey Danger. Sounds like a fake name, right? And it is,
though the band using it has invented several tales of its origin.
In one interview, Harvey Danger is described as a minor character
in ``The Great Gatsby.'' In another, the name refers to a Communist
idealist living in Indonesia in the '50s. In yet another, it's from
graffiti drawn on a wall at the University of Washington, the
band's alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   Will the real Harvey Danger please stand up?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a practical joke,'' says Sean Nelson, the Seattle
group's singer. ``You've got to tell one lie in an interview _
that's what Jenny Toomey from (the band) Tsunami told us. For a
while, we'd pick a different story about the name for each
interview. But, really, we don't do that anymore. Everything in
this interview is the truth. And the real explanation is that
Harvey Danger is from graffiti on a wall at the University of
Washington's communications building.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, we believe him, though you never know with Harvey Danger's
slap-happy, tongue-in-cheek style, evidenced most vividly in the
modern-rock hit, ``Flagpole Sitta.'' The satirical song is about a
paranoid character who ``wants to publish 'zines and rage against
machines,'' but ends up being committed to a mental hospital
because of shaky nerves. ``I'm not sick, but I'm not well ...
paranoia, paranoia, everybody's coming to get me!'' sings Nelson,
who wrote the lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   ``That song has been seized upon as a strange rant, but it's
meant to be a parody of that rant,'' adds Nelson. ``We were just
trying to write a bouncy pop song with a real classic, Troggs-style
sound,'' he says. ``We wanted it to be concise and very punchy and
very loud.''
</P>
<P>
   They succeeded on all counts. While ``Flagpole Sitta'' is one of
the novelty songs of the year, it's not all that Harvey Danger has
to offer. The group's debut album, ``Where Have All the Merrymakers
Gone?,'' is filled with Woody Allen-ish wit and wisdom, from the
punky pop of ``Carlotta Valdez'' (named for a character from Alfred
Hitchcock's ``Vertigo'') to ``Woolly Muffler'' (``All I ever wanted
to be was a woolly muffler on your naked neck, but you pulled a
little tight and I'm afraid I feel a choke hold coming on'').
</P>
<P>
   But there's also some seriousness here and there, notably on
``Jack the Lion,'' about Nelson's dying grandfather who has ``still
got a sense of humor, but his body fails him.''
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, Nelson loves songwriters like Elvis Costello,
whom he finds ``incredibly funny but also serious.'' His other
idols include a pair of Bay Staters: Lou Barlow from Sebadoh (``a
massive influence'') and Jonathan Richman, who plays a trippy
troubadour in the film ``There's Something About Mary.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Danger's four band members _ Nelson, bassist Aaron
Huffman, guitarist Jeff J. Lin, and drummer Evan Sult _ never
thought they'd become mainstream successes. They made their album
for a mere $2,000 at a Seattle studio called John &AMP; Stew's Place
(formerly Reciprocal Recording, where Nirvana made ``Bleach''). The
John is John Hermanson, who coproduced and engineered Harvey
Danger's disc and has also worked with Sleater-Kinney and Bikini
Kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``John makes a lot of albums for bands like us with no money,''
says Nelson. ``He's known for a very raw sound that's full of
energy _ and that's what we wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, 25, previously held a wide range of jobs, from actor and
filmmaker, to columnist and part-time rock critic for a Seattle
weekly called the Stranger. His column, ``Last Days,'' was a weekly
current affairs piece that took many political and social shots _
just like his lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   He gave up the column to start touring, but the last thing he
expected was that Harvey Danger would emerge from Seattle's
post-grunge underground. ``When we got our record deal, many
scenarios were presented to us,'' he says. ``One was that if it
goes well, you could be touring for months and months, maybe years.
We said, `Yeah, sure, as if that's going to happen.'''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, here they are, making their third trip to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little weird to be thrust into the mainstream like
this,'' he says, ``but it's great to see kids getting into it.''

COMPELLING HOOTIE DISC SOME OLD, SOME NEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How can an act that has sold millions of records still be hungry
enough to avoid complacency and create music that matters? That's a
question many rock 'n' rollers have been asked, from the Eagles to
Bruce Springsteen to R.E.M. to the latest example, Hootie &AMP; the
Blowfish. And Hootie &AMP; Co. have heard it constantly, ever since
selling an astonishing 15 million copies of their debut album,
``Cracked Rear View,'' in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   They sold so many copies, in fact, that they've had to contend
with a Hootie backlash ever since. Here was a band that was forged
at the non-trendy University of South Carolina, which already made
them suspect to the self-appointed hipsters who run the music
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still hungry,'' says Darius Rucker, commenting on the
band's third album, ``Musical Chairs,'' which comes out Tuesday.
``I mean, most people in this business expect us to be gone now,
you know what I mean? A lot of people expect us to put out a record
that's not going to sell. The loud naysayers are out there. So, for
us, it's like we've got to stay hungry to prove those people
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The naysayers had their way when Hootie's second album,
``Fairweather Johnson,'' sold ``only'' 2 million copies in 1996.
And Rucker thinks he knows why it slipped: ``It was our artsy
record,'' he says. ``It was just so different from `Cracked Rear
View.' There were not a lot of singles on it. We were just out to
show that world that we could write songs that weren't pop.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a looser, more welcome feel to the new album, which is
being supported by a theater tour. The new record picks up from the
trademark, tenor-vocal harmonies of ``Cracked Rear View'' (which
soared with such hits as ``Let Her Cry'' and ``Hold My Hand''),
while extolling a rootsier feel that runs from straight-ahead rock
'n' roll to R&AMP;B and even some flatpicking bluegrass on ``Desert
Mountain Showdown.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There weren't any boundaries this time,'' Rucker says in a
phone interview. ``There wasn't anybody going, `Oh, that song is
too country' or `That's too R&AMP;B.' It was just, `OK, that's the
song. Let's do it.' It was cool to see us try out some new stuff.
It might be a surprise at first, but after people hear it a few
times, they're going to go, `That's still Hootie &AMP; the Blowfish.'''
</P>
<P>
   And that's something that couldn't always be said of
``Fairweather Johnson,'' which veered off on many tangents, not all
of them interesting. The new disc is the most compelling Hootie
record since ``Cracked Rear View'' and was hatched in free-wheeling
songwriting sessions in Jackson Hole, Wyo., a favorite hangout of
the band.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love Jackson Hole,'' says Rucker. ``It's a spiritual place,
and we have friends there. It was a wonderful place to go and write
songs. I'd wake up and there would be a moose right on the lawn.''
</P>
<P>
   The sessions started slowly, because the band had taken nine
months off and had not seen much of each other in that time. It was
its first prolonged break after years of playing up to 250 shows
annually, dating back to eight years before they even had a record
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people you talk to think you had been doing this for
only six months until you got your record deal,'' says Rucker.
``No, man. We got signed in 1993 but had been playing for
eight-plus years. We paid our dues. ... I've been doing this since
I was 19. I'm 32 now. That's a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   A smart move was to take the songs on the road for a so-called
``guerrilla tour'' that found the group playing marathon three-hour
shows, including one in Boston. The Boston show at Avalon was so
long that this writer's car ended up getting locked in a nearby
parking garage overnight. And this was on a Monday night, a night
when you least suspected that a band would play right up until
curfew time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those shows definitely helped the recording process a lot,''
says Rucker. ``It helped us decide what songs to put on the album.
Because there were songs where people that saw us, who were
friends, would say, `You should never play that song again.' But
every new song we played in Boston did end up on the the record.''
</P>
<P>
   The best of the new tunes are ``I Will Wait,'' a harmony-laden,
rock 'n' roll love song that is already making waves at radio .
Then there's the Byrdsy ``Las Vegas Nights,'' the anthemic ``Answer
Man'' (``I can't be your answer man/ I don't want to follow you''),
and the coming-of-age, acoustic-guitar ballad, ``Home Again.''
</P>
<P>
   A few new songs are saddled with greeting-card-level lyrics, but
others, like ``Only You,'' have a new-found depth (``When you close
your eyes in your deepest thoughts, do you see me?''). And all are
wedded together by Rucker's familiar, subtly passionate ease on
lead vocals. If you've been a Hootie fan before, you'll love this
record. And if you haven't, you may still be surprised by the
band's developing musicianship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just love to play together _ and that's always been pretty
much a constant,'' Rucker says of bandmates Mark Bryan (guitar),
Soni Sonefeld (drums), and Dean Felber (bass). ``Right now, we're a
career band. We're going to keep doing this. But you can take me by
my word when I say that the day when this is no fun anymore, I'm
leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, a final, important question: When you tour this fall, will
there be more three-hour shows?
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows?'' says Rucker with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I'm taking a cab this time. No need to have my car locked
in a parking garage again, even though it was three hours well
spent with a band that, despite what cynics say, still has some
growth years left.

A TOY FOR THE RICH AND AN ENTRY FOR THE BUDGET-MINDED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, September 13, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Once more we offer a pair of extremes under the Automotive
umbrella, the Acura NSX, a hideously expensive sports car, and the
Daewoo Nubira, a modestly priced Korean entry available as sedan or
wagon.
</P>
<P>
   The tour with the NSX is a revisit after a long hiatus; not
since 1990, shortly after its introduction, has the columnist's
derriere graced the cockpit of this ``super car'' from the high-end
division of Honda. Since then, there have been significant changes
_ not the least of which is price.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced at the then extravagant $64,000 level, the NSX now
begins at the $84,000 mark and steps briskly to $88,000 (plus $725
destination) for the NSX-T, an NSX with a detachable hardtop.
Oxygen, please. That's a lot of money for a mid-engine two-seater
styled like a doorstop.
</P>
<P>
   The original tour with the NSX involved a drive to Cleveland and
back, during which the traction control failed, and an encounter
with black ice on Interstate 84 in Pennsylvania, where the antilock
brakes failed. There is a strong case to be made for omitting ABS
on a sports car, a case severely weakened in this country by the
appallingly poor state of what passes for driver training.
</P>
<P>
   That early NSX not only offered this writer a sudden opportunity
to contemplate eternity but also proved an uncomfortable,
back-killer in the bargain. This summer's encounter with an NSX-T
proved comfortable, enjoyable, and offered no brush with
immortality _ but at $88K there's no chance I'll ever covet one.
</P>
<P>
   Acura offers a choice of transmission: a 4-speed automatic or a
6-speed manual. There is no difference in price, but there is a
difference in engine. The automatic is mated to a 2.997-liter V-6,
the manual with a 3.197 V-6, basically the same engine in all
respects except power and displacement. The tested manual model
seemed not so much a car as an airplane permanently constrained to
the bounds of ground effect _ in the words of a more precise
colleague: ``It boogies.''
</P>
<P>
   It also handles superbly.
</P>
<P>
   A far cry from the early model, the seats in this edition were
paragons of comfort _ no need to keep the chiropractor's number
handy. The dash currently is less cluttered than I remembered it,
and radio and air conditioning feature knobs. Simplicity itself.
</P>
<P>
   OK it's fast, fun, and a blast to drive, but it's not exactly
perfection on wheels _ at least not if you consider getting in or
out of an NSX.
</P>
<P>
   The NSX-T offers better entry/exit, if you leave the roof off;
with a roof, entry or exit can be painful _ watch your head and
prepare to bend like a pretzel. If you're planning to bring
anything with you, make sure it's small, like the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   There was a mechanical lapse of sorts; the fuel-door release
didn't, requiring your reporter to resort to the can-opener blade
of a Swiss Army knife to assist in refueling. This was accomplished
without marring so much as the paint on the edge of the fuel door.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel mileage was a pleasant surprise; this ground rocket
delivered 24.2 miles per gallon over 560 miles of spirited driving
_ on premium, of course.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, the NSX-T is fun in the sun, but I still wouldn't
trust it past September.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Daewoo is a Korean company expanding into the United States, a
former partner of General Motors offering a line of three marques,
the bottom feeder Lanos, mid-range Nubira, and top-of-the-line
Laganza. Since reviewing the Laganza (Sunday Globe, June 7, 1998),
I've had a chance to slide behind the wheel of a Nubira wagon and a
sedan. For the money, the Nubira would seem to be a decent buy _
depending, of course, upon how well three or four years' driving
one will support those first impressions.
</P>
<P>
   The Nubira is available as four-door sedan or station wagon for
$13K to $15K delivered and reasonably well outfitted. The engine is
a 16-valve, in-line four-cylinder, a basic design of Holden, the
Australian manufacturer, offering 128.7 horsepower and 136 ft/lb
torque _ adequate, but nothing to write home about.
</P>
<P>
   Acceleration is OK, and the four-banger is fairly noisy when you
put your foot into it. The engine in both models tested was linked
to a four-speed automatic transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Room up front is good; legroom in the rear can be tight if front
occupants push their seats back. Front seats are manually adjusted,
sometimes awkward to manipulate.
</P>
<P>
   Nubira has a fair glove box, seat-back pockets, and a small bin
behind the shifter convenient for coins or as a cupholder. Two
cupholders are in a hideaway shelf ahead of the shifter. Outside
mirror controls are behind the shifter, near the parking brake.
</P>
<P>
   The AC is good with fairly convenient controls; radio controls,
on the other hand, may tax your patience. The wagon roof rack
emulates Audi _ two rails sans cross bars or rubbing stakes, an
arrangement of no practical use unless you don't care about roof
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel mileage was outstanding, close to 30 m.p.g.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, the Nubira looks like decent transport on the cheap
_ but nobody has a handle on Daewoo durability in American traffic.
Their previous entry here bore the Pontiac LeMans badge and sparked
no wave of desire in American hearts.
</P>
<P>
   What really raises the caution flag, though, is the marketing
plan, a strategy that includes college students hawking the cars on
campus, not exactly a move that will inspire confidence in the
business savvy of Daewoo.
</P>
<P>
   So, thumbs up or thumbs down? Let's say a thumb up with fingers
crossed.

ALLEN AGAIN JUST A ROOKIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CBS analyst Marcus Allen made his debut last Sunday on ``The NFL
Today'' and is not ashamed to admit that he was scared to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I know how rookie quarterbacks feel when they are faced
with enormous expectations and pressure to give their team
something to build on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No kidding. CBS spent $4.4 billion for the rights to broadcast
AFC games, ending the network's five-year NFL absence. Though CBS
has hired some of the best on-air talent in the country for the
games, it's the pregame show that sets the tone.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the reviews are mixed. Host Jim Nantz was livelier than
his past somnolent performances, but the chemistry between Allen,
former 49ers tight end Brent Jones, and former San Francisco coach
George Seifert seemed a bit contrived.
</P>
<P>
   Each knows a lot about football and can articulate his thoughts.
But knowledge is not the problem. It's more subtle. The timing
among the three is off and it's not quite clear what their roles
are.
</P>
<P>
   Allen concedes as much and argues that the CBS team should not
be compared to those of Fox and ESPN, not only because those
networks have been at it longer but also because CBS has not
defined the analysts' roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of our show is that each of us can go in our own
direction,'' Allen said. ``Once we get into our third or fourth
week, our chemistry will develop. Each of us will really ignore the
camera and simply start having conversations. It will be more
natural.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen said he didn't realize how much information he could
accumulate during the week yet have so little time to convey it.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Allen and Jones were rushed, trying to cram as much as
they could into a 30-second slot. That made for an almost dizzying
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we have room for improvement,'' Allen said. ``I don't
think any of us were pleased with our performance. But by the same
token, we were also encouraged. Jim Nantz is the consummate
professional and he basically carried three rookies who were flying
by the seat of their pants. It's just a matter of time, though. We
will develop our own niche.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
This can't be embraced &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fox play-by-play announcer Joe Buck delivered a solid
performance during Mark McGwire's record-setting 62d home run and
the aftermath Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   But that performance has to be given an asterisk.
</P>
<P>
   Right before conducting a postgame interview, Buck asked McGwire
for a hug.
</P>
<P>
   It would be one thing if McGwire saw Buck and the embrace was
spontaneous. But to ask for one is an entirely different story,
especially when most of the viewing audience didn't know that Buck
and McGwire have become friends since McGwire's arrival in St.
Louis last year.
</P>
<P>
   It came off as pandering at best and jock-worshipping at worst.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Buck's slip-up didn't hurt Fox in the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The game pulled a national rating of 12.9 with a 21 share, the
highest regular-season rating for a major league baseball game on
network television since 1982, when ABC's ``Monday Night Baseball''
pulled a 13.4 and 23 share.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis, of course, had the highest rating with a 43.4 rating
and 59 share, followed by Cleveland (21.2/30) and Miami (18.2/26).
</P>
<P>
   And quite naturally, Boston came in below the national average
with a 12.5.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Tennis, anyone? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CBS airs the final rounds of the US Open this weekend, starting
today at 11 a.m. until 6 p.m. with the men's doubles and women's
singles semifinals, including matches between second seed Martina
Hingis and No. 3 Jana Novotna, and No. 5 Venus Williams and No. 2
Lindsay Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m., CBS shows the women's final
and the men's semifinals. Sunday from 4-7 p.m., CBS will have the
men's final.

ATHLETES AND COLLEGE SHOULD MIX, SOMEHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe John Cooper just doesn't get it. Then again, maybe he's
just a football coach, paid to do his job the best way he can, and
he was expressing publicly what most coaches think privately.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what happened. Two days after top-ranked Ohio State
opened its season with an impressive 34-17 victory over West
Virginia, Cooper was telling the media about how tough it was
keeping his team focused _ not on the game, but on football.
</P>
<P>
   All those distractions you know. ``Ideally for us, you come over
to Woody Hayes, you practice, you go to study hall, you eat, and
you go home,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   God forbid the football team mingle with the student body.
</P>
<P>
   The Woody Hayes to which Cooper was referring is an athletic
facility second to none in college football which Ohio State uses
for its athletes, primarily football players.
</P>
<P>
   The problem _ as some see it _ is that the multimillion-dollar
complex is on the edge of campus, away from the day-to-day business
of Ohio State University.
</P>
<P>
   You can't blame Cooper. His job depends on winning football
games, and the more seclusion he can get, the better he likes it.
</P>
<P>
   But the last time anyone looked, it still was the Ohio State
University football team, not the Woody Hayes team, as Buckeye
athletic director Andy Geiger jokingly suggested it could become if
Cooper had his way.
</P>
<P>
   At big-time football schools such as Ohio State, players are
isolated enough from the mainstream of college students.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the NCAA membership, mindful of the isolation
that seemed to be increasing, voted to eliminate athletic dorms in
an attempt to get teams more into the mainstream of campus
activity.
</P>
<P>
   What Cooper wants would make sense _ if he was coaching a pro
team. Despite the snickers from some cynics, college football
hasn't reached that point. Yet.
</P>
<P>
   Geiger, an AD with enough experience to recognize the landscape,
made sense when he said such isolation would not be beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a centrally located academic unit would mean that the
athletes would have their own special place and it would become
even more elite and exclusive and more incubated than it is now,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The business of sequestering football players during the season
is not new. One of former Boston College coach Tom Coughlin's
frustrations was that he could only have access to his players for
a limited time each week and had to worry about other things than
football when dealing with them.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Coughlin got out and went to the NFL, where
football is a business and he can deal with it as much as he wants.
</P>
<P>
   One of the lures of college football is the atmosphere. There is
an interaction between the student body and the team, even if it
happens only on Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper's wishes for a cocoon-like existence for his team are
understandable but misguided. His argument, which also is
reasonable, is that since he is responsible for everything his
players do on and off the field, he would like to know where they
are most, if not all, of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Having a self-contained athletic facility offering everything,
would help him do that. But in the long run, it would not serve
either Ohio State or the players who represent the school as
students as well as athletes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Not a good sign
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Illinois, which has lost 18 straight games, should have known
its streak wasn't going to end last weekend against Washington
State. The Illini were scheduled to leave on a chartered jet from
Decatur last Friday afternoon but were three hours late in
departing. Why? The pilots thought they wer picking up a team in
Decatur, Ga., and were halfway there before realizing their mistake
... One of the best names in college football this season belongs
to Montana quarterback Brian Ah Yat, who threw six touchdown passes
and ran for another score in a 49-42 come-from-behind win over
Stephen F. Austin last week ... Bowling Green meets Penn State
Saturday, and the Falcons are expected to be the not-so-willing
victim as Nittany Lions coach Joe Paterno goes after career win No.
300. No big deal, you say. Well, here's the odd part. Guess which
team Penn State beat when Paterno won his 200th game. Yes, it was
Bowling Green, which lost, 45-19, to the Lions Sept. 5, 1987 ...
Miami has blocked 26 kicks in 35 games under coach Butch Davis,
including two in last week's 66-17 rout of East Tennessee State ...
Nice win for Alabama coach Mike DuBose last Saturday against
Brigham Young. It was also DuBose's first win at Bryant-Denny
Stadium. The Tide were 0-4 at Tuscaloosa last season.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Lost weekend
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes you lose games and sometimes you LOSE games. Ask West
Virginia. Not only did Ohio State manhandle the Mountaineers last
Saturday, but coach Don Nehlen's team lost star linebacker Gary
Stills indefinitely with a cracked kneecap and backup safety with
Rick Sherrod with a torn knee ligament and cartilage damage.
``We'll see what kind of team this really is because it's facing a
lot of adversity,'' said Nehlen ... Lots of people are surprised
that Boston College is 1-0. Surprised, yes. Stunned, no. BC coach
Tom O'Brien has done the right things in his short tenure at the
Heights, and winning games you are not supposed to win is a sign
of, among other things, good coaching. With Rutgers, Temple, and
Louisville coming up, the Eagles will be in the position of trying
to win games they are expected to win, and sometimes that can be
tougher than pulling off upsets ... Most college fans know all
about Texas running back Ricky Williams, who is one of the leading
contenders for the Heisman Trophy. But the leading rusher in
college football after one week is Texas Tech's Ricky Williams, who
gained 251 yards and ran for two touchdowns on 41 carries in a 35-3
win over UTEP. Texas's Williams scored six touchdowns in a 66-36
win over New Mexico State. He rushed for only 215 yards, however
... BC's win over Georgia Tech was a definite boost for the Big
East, but Temple's 24-12 loss to Toledo and Rutgers and Pittsburgh
struggling to beat Division 1-AA teams were not ... The football
fans in Columbus, Ohio, breathed easier when All-America linebacker
Andy Katzenmoyer passed his three summer courses and was declared
eligible for the season. The courses? Golf, music, and AIDS
Awareness. Don't count on Katzenmoyer being at OSU beyond this
semester ... Southeastern Conference commissioner Roy Kramer is
talking with the Cotton Bowl powers that be about getting a berth
in the New Year's Day game for the loser of the SEC title game ...
Pittsburgh, which has been having trouble drawing fans, has added a
gimmick that more and more schools are employing. In order to get
tickets to the game against Penn State Sept. 19, Pitt fans must buy
tickets to the home game against Temple Nov. 7 ... Sometimes how
you do is a matter or perception. Ask Georgia coach Jim Donnan. ``I
went 5-6 my first year at Georgia,'' said Donnan, ``and everybody
talked about what a bad job I did. Hal (Mumme) goes 5-6 his first
year at Kentucky and everybody talks about what a great job he
did.'' ... Looking for another coach on the hot seat? Try South
Carolina's Brad Scott, who was 22-22-1 during his first four years
but is now using primarily freshmen and sophomores, not a good sign
in the fifth year of a program ... Rutgers has been outgained in 21
straight games and in 22 of 23 games under coach Terry Shea. Not
surprisingly, the Scarlet Knights are 2-19 during that period.

A TOY FOR THE RICH AND AN ENTRY FOR THE BUDGET-MINDED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, September 13, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once more we offer a pair of extremes under the Automotive
umbrella, the Acura NSX, a hideously expensive sports car, and the
Daewoo Nubira, a modestly priced Korean entry available as sedan or
wagon.
</P>
<P>
   The tour with the NSX is a revisit after a long hiatus; not
since 1990, shortly after its introduction, has the columnist's
derriere graced the cockpit of this ``super car'' from the high-end
division of Honda. Since then, there have been significant changes
_ not the least of which is price.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced at the then extravagant $64,000 level, the NSX now
begins at the $84,000 mark and steps briskly to $88,000 (plus $725
destination) for the NSX-T, an NSX with a detachable hardtop.
Oxygen, please. That's a lot of money for a mid-engine two-seater
styled like a doorstop.
</P>
<P>
   The original tour with the NSX involved a drive to Cleveland and
back, during which the traction control failed, and an encounter
with black ice on Interstate 84 in Pennsylvania, where the antilock
brakes failed. There is a strong case to be made for omitting ABS
on a sports car, a case severely weakened in this country by the
appallingly poor state of what passes for driver training.
</P>
<P>
   That early NSX not only offered this writer a sudden opportunity
to contemplate eternity but also proved an uncomfortable,
back-killer in the bargain. This summer's encounter with an NSX-T
proved comfortable, enjoyable, and offered no brush with
immortality _ but at $88K there's no chance I'll ever covet one.
</P>
<P>
   Acura offers a choice of transmission: a 4-speed automatic or a
6-speed manual. There is no difference in price, but there is a
difference in engine. The automatic is mated to a 2.997-liter V-6,
the manual with a 3.197 V-6, basically the same engine in all
respects except power and displacement. The tested manual model
seemed not so much a car as an airplane permanently constrained to
the bounds of ground effect _ in the words of a more precise
colleague: ``It boogies.''
</P>
<P>
   It also handles superbly.
</P>
<P>
   A far cry from the early model, the seats in this edition were
paragons of comfort _ no need to keep the chiropractor's number
handy. The dash currently is less cluttered than I remembered it,
and radio and air conditioning feature knobs. Simplicity itself.
</P>
<P>
   OK it's fast, fun, and a blast to drive, but it's not exactly
perfection on wheels _ at least not if you consider getting in or
out of an NSX.
</P>
<P>
   The NSX-T offers better entry/exit, if you leave the roof off;
with a roof, entry or exit can be painful _ watch your head and
prepare to bend like a pretzel. If you're planning to bring
anything with you, make sure it's small, like the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   There was a mechanical lapse of sorts; the fuel-door release
didn't, requiring your reporter to resort to the can-opener blade
of a Swiss Army knife to assist in refueling. This was accomplished
without marring so much as the paint on the edge of the fuel door.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel mileage was a pleasant surprise; this ground rocket
delivered 24.2 miles per gallon over 560 miles of spirited driving
_ on premium, of course.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, the NSX-T is fun in the sun, but I still wouldn't
trust it past September.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Daewoo is a Korean company expanding into the United States, a
former partner of General Motors offering a line of three marques,
the bottom feeder Lanos, mid-range Nubira, and top-of-the-line
Laganza. Since reviewing the Laganza (Sunday Globe, June 7, 1998),
I've had a chance to slide behind the wheel of a Nubira wagon and a
sedan. For the money, the Nubira would seem to be a decent buy _
depending, of course, upon how well three or four years' driving
one will support those first impressions.
</P>
<P>
   The Nubira is available as four-door sedan or station wagon for
$13K to $15K delivered and reasonably well outfitted. The engine is
a 16-valve, in-line four-cylinder, a basic design of Holden, the
Australian manufacturer, offering 128.7 horsepower and 136 ft/lb
torque _ adequate, but nothing to write home about.
</P>
<P>
   Acceleration is OK, and the four-banger is fairly noisy when you
put your foot into it. The engine in both models tested was linked
to a four-speed automatic transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Room up front is good; legroom in the rear can be tight if front
occupants push their seats back. Front seats are manually adjusted,
sometimes awkward to manipulate.
</P>
<P>
   Nubira has a fair glove box, seat-back pockets, and a small bin
behind the shifter convenient for coins or as a cupholder. Two
cupholders are in a hideaway shelf ahead of the shifter. Outside
mirror controls are behind the shifter, near the parking brake.
</P>
<P>
   The AC is good with fairly convenient controls; radio controls,
on the other hand, may tax your patience. The wagon roof rack
emulates Audi _ two rails sans cross bars or rubbing stakes, an
arrangement of no practical use unless you don't care about roof
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel mileage was outstanding, close to 30 m.p.g.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, the Nubira looks like decent transport on the cheap
_ but nobody has a handle on Daewoo durability in American traffic.
Their previous entry here bore the Pontiac LeMans badge and sparked
no wave of desire in American hearts.
</P>
<P>
   What really raises the caution flag, though, is the marketing
plan, a strategy that includes college students hawking the cars on
campus, not exactly a move that will inspire confidence in the
business savvy of Daewoo.
</P>
<P>
   So, thumbs up or thumbs down? Let's say a thumb up with fingers
crossed.

<HEADLINE>
FOR HIGH-TECH QUARTERBACKS, IT'S A TOUGH CALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Welcome to the high-tech NFL.
</P>
<P>
   In this age of expensive gadgetry and ultrasophisticated
communication, the play is called in the press box by the offensive
coordinator and relayed to the quarterback coach on the sideline,
who in turn feeds it to the quarterback through a radio setup in
his helmet.
</P>
<P>
   Fancy stuff. Unless there is the intrusion of something like
ungodly noise, as was the case for the Patriots in Denver Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Then mass communication becomes mass confusion: ``Uh, what did
you say? Can you repeat that, please?''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the message is delivered, the quarterback is forced
to take a timeout.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech.
</P>
<P>
   But when the situation calls for old-fashioned methods _ when
Drew Bledsoe is running a no-huddle offense and has about 10-12 set
plays he can call on his own _ what happens? The Patriots move the
ball. Bledsoe makes good decisions, fires the ball with precision
and accuracy, and everything seems to flow much better.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to simplicity in football? Why is everything so
complicated now _ or why is it that coaching staffs make it so
complicated?
</P>
<P>
   ``That conversation goes on all the time,'' said Patriots coach
Pete Carroll. ``I wish football was like that. A guy goes into the
huddle and he sees the guy (defender) is sweating too much to run
over to his side. The receiver is saying, `Hey, I can beat the
guy,' and (the quarterback) goes to him. That whole connection
between the quarterback and his offensive players _ I love that
football. We try to bring that into our game by conversing through
the game. But there's so much going on on defense and so much stuff
we do with personnel that the teams that have tried it haven't been
able to pull it off.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems Bledsoe can pull it off. For two or three minutes, he
does it brilliantly.
</P>
<P>
   Is it too much to ask of a quarterback to do it for a whole
game? Why can't things be simplified?
</P>
<P>
   Aren't the best plays the ones on which Bledsoe just fires into
a crowd of three defenders knowing that Ben Coates is somewhere in
the middle of the pack and will catch the ball?
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing sophisticated about that. That's just a feel
between the quarterback and his receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it really is a hard thing to do for a whole game,''
said Bledsoe. ``There are so many things the defenses are doing.
There's so much strategy involved. We go into a game with so many
plays, to expect to be able to call the correct play at the correct
time all the way through an entire game _ it might be too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Might be. But does Ernie Zampese call the right play every time?
Did Ray Perkins? Did Bill Parcells? Did Larry Kennan?
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask me in a couple of years when I've been in the same system
for more than one year at a time and maybe that will be a scenario
when I can call some of the plays,'' said Bledsoe. ``But I don't
think I'd ever want to be in a scenario where I was calling all of
the plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to be able to take advantage of certain things in a
game plan. Because you change things week to week, you try and take
advantage of specific tendencies or weaknesses in a defense. When
we go to our no-huddle offense, we go with a set 10-12 plays that
we use that are constant through the year. Can we do that for an
extended period? Sure, in some situations. But to do that
exclusively without a specific reason for doing it would be
foolhardy.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll points out that John Elway tried calling all his own
plays a couple of years ago and decided to scrap it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think that (Dan) Marino or Elway, after 12, 13, 15
years, would be able to do it,'' said Carroll. ``When that
situation arises, the personnel is pretty static. It's the time of
the game you set the defense where you can predict it better. In
that mode, the quarterback becomes more instinctive. They all like
it. Drew is very good at it. In those situations, Drew calls the
plays. That's his time. There might be other times in the season
when the situation will be suited for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll thinks Bledsoe can develop to the point that he calls
his own plays more often. He thought Bledsoe played as close to a
perfect game as possible in the 27-21 loss at Denver. He also
called a near-perfect game during his no-huddle opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drew is very gifted,'' said Carroll, ``and as he grows into
the offense, he'll be able to do more of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have a number of personnel groupings. There's a lot of
information to be multiple. You would think, as sharp as Steve
Young is ... he doesn't do it, either. If you feel you can stay
basic and move the football, then you can do it. But we might have
70 or 80 variations of a formation. I wish we could make the game
like that, but it doesn't seem to fit.''
</P>
<P>
   But Carroll does make one unassailable point in favor of someday
giving it a try: ``Just because nobody is doing it doesn't mean
it's not a good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, one needs a football engineering degree to make
it in the NFL. In his sixth season, Bledsoe is not sophisticated
enough to make his own calls. In his 16th season, Marino isn't,
either.
</P>
<P>
   As quarterbacks become more experienced, the offense becomes
more intricate. And the tougher it gets, the less likely it is
they'll get to call their own plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like Thursday to me,'' said Bledsoe. ``It was five or
six years ago. I do feel when those guys come in and they want to
talk to me, I'm an experienced old veteran. It's a strange
dynamic.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also strange that the offense gets so complicated that it
requires three men to call one play.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the stuff Ernie came up with specifically for the
Broncos ended up to be big stuff for us,'' said Bledsoe. ``The long
ball to Shawn (Jefferson, a 55-yarder) and some of the plays to
Terry (Glenn) gave us a chance to really execute. After watching
film, there was stuff I could have converted on third down if I had
gone somewhere else with the ball. We did all right, but not good
enough to win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   After watching the film, most fans would suggest scrapping the
fancy stuff and just staying with the basics.

FRIEND TRIED IN '78 DEATH OF BOB CRANE DIES AT 70 
</HEADLINE>
 CRANE-MURDER-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANA BALAZS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Did a raging John Henry Carpenter bash actor Bob
Crane's skull with a camera tripod as the ``Hogan's Heroes'' TV
star slept in his Scottsdale, Ariz., apartment?
</P>
<P>
   If he did, Crane's longtime friend will never be able to confess
to the 20-year-old crime. Carpenter, 70, died last week, reportedly
after a heart attack at his home in Torrance, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter was the prime suspect in Crane's June 29, 1978,
bludgeoning death. Then 49, Crane was in Scottsdale performing in a
play called ``Beginner's Luck'' at the now-defunct Windmill Dinner
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter steadfastly maintained his innocence throughout the
years. At the time of Crane's death, he even volunteered to take a
polygraph test, but police declined his offer.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades later, people are still arguing over whether
Carpenter did it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that John Carpenter was the kind of guy that had a
secret and he took it to his grave with him,'' said Scottsdale
police Lt. Barry Vassall, who was one of the case's original
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The celebrity whodunit thrust Scottsdale into the national
spotlight. Scottsdale police were accused of bungling the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Two former Maricopa County attorneys _ Charles ``Chuck'' Hyder
and Tom Collins _ examined the evidence and refused to prosecute
the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scottsdale will always say they think they had the right guy.
They think they had sufficient evidence. I will always say the
evidence presented to me at the time was insufficient. It's one of
those things you can argue forever,'' said Hyder, now a federal
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, County Attorney Rick Romley reopened the case and took
it to trial. The evidence included police photos of a speck
resembling brain or fatty tissue in Carpenter's rental car and
blood smears on the car's passenger door. A jury, however,
acquitted Carpenter of first-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like a big load has been taken off my back,'' Carpenter
said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter's widow, Diana, blamed the trial and the media for her
husband's death, according to an Associated Press report.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was tired,'' Diana Carpenter said. ``A doctor even told me,
`You can't put a 65-year-old man on trial for his life and not come
out with scars.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators remain convinced Carpenter was their man.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives suspected Carpenter was enraged over Crane's attempt
to end their friendship, a friendship that allowed Carpenter to
have sex with women drawn by the actor's fame.
</P>
<P>
   Vassall teamed up with Jim Raines, a former Phoenix police
detective who worked as a county attorney's investigator, to
re-examine the evidence, which led to Carpenter being charged. In
Raines' mind, even though Carpenter was acquitted, the case was
solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it amounts to is throughout history many, many suspects
have been brought to trial and a jury said they were not guilty and
they were guilty. This is one of those cases,'' Raines said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that some jurors mentioned to him after the trial that
they thought Carpenter did it, but they didn't think the evidence
was strong enough.
</P>
<P>
   Raines, now with the Arizona Attorney General's Office, is
writing a book on the slaying, along with California author Irwin
Fisk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though this (Carpenter's death) is another chapter, I
don't believe it's the final chapter,'' Raines said. ``This entire
Crane situation seems to have a life of its own.'' &QL;

the authorities in both places were not playing to an international

<P>
   When the ship is on the rocks, it is seldom the moment for an
argument. On the SS Russia, however, Captain Boris Yeltsin and his
rebellious crew have wasted valuable salvage time haggling about
who should be the next chief engineer. The passengers, meanwhile,
are glumly watching the water rise, noting the lack of lifeboats.
</P>
<P>
   The financial weather still looks fearful. But at least the
political mutiny seemed set to calm down when, on Thursday, Yeltsin
conceded that he would not be able to persuade the Duma, Russia's
recalcitrant lower house of parliament, to ratify the appointment
of his former prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Chernomyrdin withdrew, declaring grandly that ``Russia
has had enough upheavals this century,'' thereby opening the way
for Yeltsin to nominate his acting foreign minister, Yevgeny
Primakov. The Communists said they would accept his nomination.
This should bring some political peace -- at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov is a wily old apparatchik, who has served loyally under
every Russian leader since Leonid Brezhnev. Formerly the head of
the country's spy service, he took over as foreign minister in
1996. Under what is known as the ``Primakov doctrine,'' Russian
diplomacy has become more prickly and uncooperative, even reckless.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the sharpest clashes have taken place in the Middle
East. Under Primakov, Russia has consistently lobbied for the end
of sanctions against Iraq. An Arabic speaker, Primakov has
long-standing personal ties to Iraq's President Saddam Hussein. He
has also loyally stood by another unpleasant Russian ally, Slobodan
Milosevic, the Yugoslav president -- and strongly opposes NATO
action against the Serbs in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, Primakov, is at least a presentable face for
Russia: neither drunk, nor ill, nor a political amateur, and with a
modicum of administrative ability.
</P>
<P>
   He is much-liked by hardliners of left and right for his
anti-Western stance, and his defense of what he likes to call
Russia's ``great power status.'' He will also be backed, on more
pragmatic grounds, by reformers such as Boris Nemtsov, the acting
deputy prime minister, and has been pushed forward by Grigory
Yavlinsky, leader of Yabloko, the social-democratic party.
</P>
<P>
   All of which probably makes him the least bad choice. Russia
will now get a government, which will at least start on better
terms with the cantankerous Duma than the previous one -- and have
a chance of putting together an economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this will be a sensible one is unclear. Primakov's own
economic views are opaque. He has virtually no economic or
financial experience. His government may well contain some
reformers, such as Boris Fedorov, an economist much liked in the
West -- but also a clutch of Communists to placate the Duma. Even
if he wants to tackle vested interests in business or the
bureaucracy, which so often block reform, he will have no power
base from which to do so.
</P>
<P>
   He offers stability, and a degree of obstructive coherence in
dealings with the outside world, but not the decisive leadership
and real changes Russia sorely needs.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative would have been simmering constitutional
uncertainty, to add to Russia's financial and economic woes. The
Duma had already rejected Chernomyrdin twice, and would probably
have done so again (not surprisingly -- for five years, until he
was sacked in March, he governed with scant success). Yeltsin would
then have had to dissolve the Duma and call a general election.
</P>
<P>
   This conundrum, with luck, will not now require an answer. But
many still believe that if Russia is to get back on an even keel it
needs a new president as much as a new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's authority is thoroughly diminished. So far, he has
seemed determined to hang on, though Moscow was filled with rumor
this week that he would resign -- leaving his new prime minister as
head of state.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, Russia remains, on the whole, remarkably calm.
Most banks are still paying out small amounts of money. The queues
outside their branches are orderly, if morose. Most shops still
stock most goods, although not staples such as flour and sugar,
which have been snapped up by nervous shoppers. The ruble's
exchange rate yo-yos, falling by a third one day, rising by a
quarter the next.
</P>
<P>
   The signs, however, are ominous. Inflation is rocketing. Prices
rose by 36 percent in the first week of September alone, throwing
millions more households into poverty. Imports fell by a third in
August. The effect of the collapsed banking system and tottering
insurance industry has yet to be felt.
</P>
<P>
   Even reformers in the government think printing rubles is
inevitable, whoever replaces the central bank's chairman, Sergei
Dubinin, who resigned this week. The country's hard-currency
reserves are barely $12 billion, making a default on its foreign
debt all too likely.
</P>
<P>
   The best anyone can hope for is that the current mess may prove
a salutary shock to those who caused it, especially the tycoons
who, along with regional bosses, now hold most of the real power in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, though unlikely, that the shipwreck will make
Russia's elite behave more responsibly, perhaps even by backing,
one day, a genuinely reforming government. But a lot of people, by
then, will have drowned.
</P>
<P>
   As for Primakov, he will be steering a very leaky ship.

SCIENTISTS TRACK TOY CARS IN QUEST TO LEARN ABOUT OCEANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Scientists are tracking an oceanic armada
comprised of 100,000 toy cars and a million party balloons that
fell off a cargo ship near Japan last January.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers are studying how ocean winds and waves nudge the
colorful debris across the Pacific. Their goal is to better
understand ocean circulation.
</P>
<P>
   And they are asking beachgoers in the Western United States and
Canada to keep an eye out for the debris, all in the interests of
science and environmentalism.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early for beachcombers to start combing the sands,
though. The debris probably won't start sloshing ashore until
January 2000, initially in Oregon, Washington state and British
Columbia, according to the scientists' computerized simulation of
the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The debris could continue to wash ashore for decades, said
Curtis C. Ebbesmeyer, an oceanographer in Seattle who specializes
in tracking ocean debris.
</P>
<P>
   The research might yield practical benefits. With improved
understanding of ocean circulation, scientists could better grasp
how the seas disperse oil spills and other toxic chemicals.
Ebbesmeyer said debris can remain impressively concentrated for
long trips across the sea.
</P>
<P>
   And there is plenty of debris out there.
</P>
<P>
   In today's world economy, as freighters crisscross the oceans
with goods from many lands, some ships encounter storms. The
occasional result is that a ship tips over too far, dunking giant
boxes of products into the waves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever humans do is reflected on the ocean,'' Ebbesmeyer
said. ``You name an activity, and I can tell you a story.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebbesmeyer collaborates on the research with W. James Ingraham
Jr. of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in
Seattle. Ingraham is constantly refining the ocean-simulating
computer program, or Ocean Surface Current Simulator.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it OSCAR,'' Ebbesmeyer said.
</P>
<P>
   OSCAR predicts the movements of ocean debris by analyzing
Pacific weather data reported by the U.S. Navy. By analyzing
differences in air pressure, it forecasts how winds will blow.
Winds affect the movement of both the debris and the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds simple, but it gets complicated. The computer, for
example, must take into account a slight kink in wind directions,
caused by the rotation of the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, debris motions are tough to anticipate. Two years
ago, Ebbesmeyer and Ingraham tried to help the University of
Washington locate a lost undersea robot by forecasting its path.
Searchers still haven't found the sub.
</P>
<P>
   Debris may stay afloat for many years and travel incredibly long
distances, Ebbesmeyer said.
</P>
<P>
   He recently acquired a Nike shoe with an identifying mark
showing it was made in 1982. It washed ashore in Washington state
after 16 years at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Ebbesmeyer has benefited from the help of hundreds of volunteers
who look for interesting debris on the coasts. His newsletter,
Beachcombers' Alert, has more than 300 subscribers. He also runs a
Web site, www.beachcombers.org. Anyone who wishes to participate in
Ebbesmeyer's search for the latest ocean debris should check the
Web site for details.
</P>
<P>
   The retrieval of flotsam isn't limited to oceanography. For
decades, meteorologists gained insights into atmospheric
circulation by launching weather balloons with cards attached
asking a finder to contact the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   And at the University of Oklahoma, storm experts track down
debris scattered by tornadoes. They have tracked items such as
personal checks up to hundreds of miles away. Their findings could
help scientists better understand how a tornado might
catastrophically distribute toxins, should one strike a chemical
factory, nuclear waste site or other environmentally sensitive
facility.
</P>
<P>
   The research being done by Ebbesmeyer and Ingraham is a reminder
that when it comes to the ocean, national boundaries are
meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Debris from Japanese ships has been washing up in Hawaii _
plastic bottles, wine bottles, fishing nets,'' Ebbesmeyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite a bit of New York trash goes right over to Britain.
(Researchers have estimated) that 30 percent of the trash on the
western Scotland coast comes from North America.''

TEXAS CITIES TO TAKE CLOSER LOOK AT COMMUTER RAIL LINK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT HUDDLESTON  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ City leaders have agreed to join Austin in
exploring the long-discussed concept of commuter rail service for
the increasingly congested corridor between the two Texas cities.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents see the proposed service, which would run from the
Kelly Air Force Base to Georgetown, north of Austin, as a way to
relieve Interstate 35 traffic congestion in the rapidly growing
region.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio Mayor Howard Peak said the city's participation in
the new Commuter Rail Facilitation Committee would allow San
Antonio and Austin, the state capital, to begin studying the
project without any obligations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad to see this step,'' said Peak, who supported the
corridor-rail concept while serving as chairman of the Metropolitan
Planning Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council approved a resolution Thursday authorizing Peak
to appoint a representative to the facilitation committee.
</P>
<P>
   Results of a Texas Department of Transportation study of the
project's feasibility are expected in about six months. A 1997
state law authorizes San Antonio, Austin and Bexar and Travis
counties to jointly create a commuter-rail district to oversee
development of the service, possibly on tracks just west of I-35
now used by freight trains.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin City Council passed a resolution in March supporting
creation of a rail district. But Travis County commissioners opted
in June to wait until more is known about the funding and
feasibility of the project.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement between the metropolitan planning agencies
representing the Austin and San Antonio areas, the nine-member
facilitation panel is to monitor the state's study, examine
financing issues, recommend needed changes to the 1997 law, and
meet with officials of Union Pacific Railroad, which owns the I-35
tracks.

   RELEASE OF STARR REPORT
</P>
<P>
   REPORT _ WASHINGTON _ The contents of the Starr report. Story
will also serve as a ledeall, with high summaries of White House
action, public reaction and congressional reaction. (Shepard, Cox
News Service).
</P>
<P>
   REPORT-SEX _ WASHINGTON _ The reported ``salacious details'' in
the report, if they erode President Clinton's standing among a
shocked public, may have greater power to shake his hold on office
that the charges of perjury and other impeachable offenses.
(Nesmith, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   With REPORT-SEXADDICT _ WASHINGTON _ Even before details of
President Clinton's extramarital sexual activity were made public,
some mental health professionals have concluded that the cravings
that supposedly steamed up the Oval Office are those of a ``sex
addict.'' Other psychotherapists caution that understanding the
mental underpinnings of human behavior _ or even learning exactly
what happened _ usually takes hours of one-on-one exchange between
patient and therapist. (Nesmith, Cox News Service 950).
</P>
<P>
   MOVED in (w) Washington and (l) lifestyle categories.
</P>
<P>
   REPORT-CLINTON _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton acknowledged
Friday that ``I have sinned'' and extended his apology to Monica
Lewinsky and her family, but also promised to fight impeachment
charges. A look at Bill Clinton the man _ repentant and defiant _
on the day of his greatest political peril. (Deans, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   REPORT-REBUT _ WASHINGTON _ The White House's official response
to the Starr report and the legal strategy for the impeachment
battle. (Malone, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   REPORT-CONG-DEMS _ WASHINGTON _ Congressional Democrats'
reaction to the report. (Carr, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   REPORT-CONG-GOP _ WASHINGTON _ Congressional Republicans'
reaction to the report. (Sherman, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   REPORT-COLOR _ WASHINGTON _ The Capitol Hill scene as the report
is released. (Dart, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   PBP-BUZZ (12-15 inches) _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Public
reaction to the release of the Starr report. (Palm Beach Post)
</P>
<P>
   PBP-REACT (developing) _ Politicians' reaction. (Staff, Palm
Beach Post)
</P>
<P>
   REPORT-ANALYSIS _ WASHINGTON _ How is the Lewinsky scandal like
Watergate? For one thing, it shows again that the cover-up is worse
than the crime, and that politicians never seem to learn that
lesson. For another, it shows that a president's ultimate fate
rests in the public's opinion of hin, and that opinion can change
quickly. (Glass, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   REPORT-INTERNET _ WASHINGTON _ The Internet has demonstrated its
maturity as a communications medium in how it has driven public
policy in the Lewinsky scandal. (Regan, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   With REPORT-INTERNET-HITS _ How the Internet is coping with
public demand for access to the report. (Katz, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   REPORT-BATES _ WASHINGTON _ To help write the investigative
report to Congress that the world is finally reading, Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr has turned to a soft-spoken literary lawyer
who shares his small-town Texas roots. Unlike the hard-bitten
career prosecutors who make up most of the team that has
investigated President Clinton for four years, Stephen Bates was
recruited as much for his talents as a scholarly wordsmith as for
his legal skills as a Harvard-educated attorney. (Dart, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   MOVED in (w) Washington and (l) lifestyle categories.
</P>
<P>
   AUS-TX-STARR-REACT _ As Texas Republicans begin a three-day tour
of the state, we get their reaction to the Starr report. Will wrap
in reaction from Democrats as well. Herman, Austin
American-Statesman
</P>
<P>
   DDN-COX-PRAYER: When Clinton opened the religious prayer
breakfast today, he said a Jewish prayer for atonement. We check
who's praying for the president locally, see what the Jewish
community thinks and try to see what local pastors are going to say
from the pulpit on Sunday. (Kline, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   DDN-COX-SCHOOL: The crisis unfolding in Washington is history in
the making. So we visit a Centerville High School honors government
class to hear the conversations, issues and concerns over our
American govenment, because to them- this is their equivalent to
Watergate. (Fisher, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   MONICA-FLU _ The public's disgust with President Clinton's
affair may mean Democrats stay home on Election Day while outraged
Republicans turn out in higher numbers, political pollsters said.
One Republican Capitol Hill aide called it ``Monica flu.'' ``That
turnout effect may have a devastating effect on local Democrats,''
said John Green, a political science professor at the University of
Akron. (Bischoff/Montgomery, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   AUS-TROP-STORM-FRANCES _ Tropical Storm Frances came ashore near
Refugio early this morning, but Galveston and Houston got hit the
hardest early. Galveston reports localized flooding, evacuation of
some residents, power lines down, businesses and schools closed,
but no injuries as of 8 a.m. as the storm moved toward the Hill
Country. Austin and other areas northeast of the center could be
looking at heavy rains and flooding later today. (Harmon, Austin
American-Statesman)

   INTERNATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-CRISIS-0911 _ MOSCOW _ Prime Minister Yvegeny Primakov
was confirmed Friday by parliament, ending Russia's three-week
political crisis. But concerns turned to the country's economic
turmoil and how the new government will deal with it. President
Boris Yeltsin on Friday appointed communist and former central
banker Viktor Geraschenko to again lead the central bank. He was
blamed for printing print money and creating hyper-inflation in
Russia in 1993. It prompted Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs to call
Geraschenko ``the worst central banker in the world.'' (Holmes, Cox
News Service.)

<P>
   EDs: Expected to move by 4 p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   LATAM-ECONOMY-0911 _ MIAMI _ Fears are rising that Latin
America's economic leader, Brazil, will be pushed into a massive
devaluation. Such a move would have a domino effect across the
entire region. Local shares in Brazil took their biggest one-day
plunge in 11 years on Thursday. What happens in Latin America will
have major repercussions in the United States. A fifth of U.S.
exports go to Latin America, and American banks have made big loans
to Brazil. (Emling, Cox News Service).

   JAMAICA-BIRDWATCHING-$ADV12 _ MONTEGO BAY, Jamaica _ Sure,
Jamaica's known for its stunning beaches and plush resorts, but
being near the water and sipping margaritas aren't all there is to
do in this popular Caribbean country. Birdwatching, for example, is
attracting a growing number of travelers. And, Jamaica boasts one
of the Caribbean's most unique attractions: the Rocklands Feeding
Station in the village of Anchovy, just a short drive from Montego
Bay. At the station, home to 93-year-old ornithologist Lisa Salmon,
visitors can feed all sorts of wild birds from the palms of their
hands. Visitors can also hunt for butterflies -- Jamaica is home to
the largest butterfly in the Americas. So, you don't have to go to
Jamaica just for the water. (Emling, Cox News Service).

   CARIBBEAN-CRIME-$ADV12 _ PARADISE ISLAND, Bahamas _ It's called
paradise, but this island is having a hard time living up to its
name. In the past two weeks, three foreigners have been murdered
here, including a young American school teacher. The latest murder
occured on Sept. 2 when a man who worked on Carnival Cruise Line's
Fantasy ship was shot to death during a robbery. No one's been
accused of the crimes and so, according to the headlines, there's a
``Killer On The Loose.'' But the Bahamas is not only plagued by
rising crime, it's also awash with drugs, mostly cocaine. During
the first three months of 1998, officials seized more cocaine than
in the previous three years combined. All this hardly bodes well
for the reputation of the Bahamas, or for the winter months, the
biggest season for tourists in the Caribbean. The Bahamian islands
host 3 million tourists each year, and rely on tourists for 70
percent of their income. (Emling, Cox News Service).

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Other strange stories lurk behind Clinton saga
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Keepin' up with the times:
</P>
<P>
   -- While we're all marching double time to catch up with the
president's slap-and-tickle, another outing too: Helen Chenoweth,
R-Idaho, has admitted to a long affair in the '80s with a married
man, thus joining Rep. Dan Burton, R-Indiana, similarly confessed,
at the sinners' bar.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult not to sink to the unworthy -- scrap that. It's
impossible not to sink to the unworthy thought, and enjoy it a
fisson of even less worthy delight, that Chenoweth had it coming.
She's one of those holier-than-thou ``family values'' demagogues in
which the Republican Party specializes; and to boot has been an
apologist for the militias that plague the western mountain states.
</P>
<P>
   Chenoweth, caught out by her hometown newspaper, has assured
voters, as her re-election date nears, ``I've asked for God's
forgiveness, and I've received it.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe so, but Idaho voters might ask the Federal Elections
Commission if it can verify the endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   -- Medical researchers say they've scored a big breakthrough in
fertility wizardly with a technique that, as it becomes more
refined, will let would-be parents pick the gender of their child.
</P>
<P>
   That's a step in the right direction but a small one. We'll
really be getting somewhere when science can decide not just what
gender but which child.
</P>
<P>
   Will it be one who picks up the toys without being hounded? Can
we be guaranteed one who will never want any sneakers that cost
over $25? A girl who thinks one Barbie doll is enough? A boy who'll
say, ``Thanks, dad, but I really don't feel the need for a car of
my own.''
</P>
<P>
   This new technology will be fully mature and a boon to the
peaceable disposition of society when it can engineer kids who, at
30, won't still be hanging around the house saying, ``Hey, man. I'm
just getting my act together.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Easily the strangest stories in the run-up to Mark McGwire's
awesome No. 62 were in the sudden sunburst to quasi-news
speculating on the vicious tax liability that would hit any poor
soul in the stands who was unlucky enough to catch the historic
ball.
</P>
<P>
   Surely you heard all the alarmism. Talk radio's professional
hysterics, especially, had a baseball field day as they anticipated
the predations of the bogeyman Internal Revenue Service. Assuming
the ball had a value of a million dollars, the income tax for the
fan unable to dodge it would be $143,750. Or if the fan gave it
away, like a hot coal, the gift tax would be about the same -- by
some accountings adding up to a breath-sucking $287,500.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem with all this was that it was perfect nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the impending tax mugging, IRS didn't dare say it
wouldn't happen. Tax-law sharpies all over the country would take
any disclaimer as a loophole-to-be. But in practice, that sort of
taxation simply doesn't happen. No reporter seems to have tried to
find a single real-life case to support the speculation.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal's editorial page took the prospect as
evidence of the evil handiwork of Democrats and one more reason to
elect a Republican Congress. The Wall Street Journal editorial page
has the all the whimsy of an anvil.

   MIAMI _ A dramatic interest rate hike eased fears Friday that
Brazil would be forced to devalue its currency, a move that would
have a domino effect on all of Latin America, a region that's
already been hard-hit by turmoil in Russia and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Shares on the Sao Paulo stock exchange jumped up 6 percent early
Friday, and analysts said it appeared that dollar flight had been
reversed for the first time in weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Stock and currency markets in Brazil had taken a bad beating
Thursday as jittery investors continued to yank money from emerging
markets that are considered more and more risky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latin America is being hit hard right now, but I think Brazil
is taking positive steps to keep a devaluation from happening,''
said Don Bowler, regional director for Latin America for the
Economist Intelligence Unit in London, an economic research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's $800 billion-a-year economy is twice the size of
Russia's, and nearly twice the size of Mexico's.
</P>
<P>
   If Brazil suffers, it will likely drag down other major U.S.
trading partners, and the United States will surely feel the pain.
</P>
<P>
   More than a fifth of all American exports -- or some $70.8
billion -- go to Mexico, Central and South America.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. banks have outstanding loans of some $16 billion to Brazil,
more than double their exposure to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   And Brazil expects to bring in $12 billion in U.S. investment
this year, a 50-percent jump over last year, from companies such as
Xerox Corp., Coca-Cola Co., and General Motors Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Continued turbulence in Asia and the devaluation of the ruble in
Russia have helped knock major Latin stock markets down by as much
as 72 percent in dollar terms this year.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, economists have trimmed growth estimates for the
region, particularly for next year. Average growth for Latin
America in 1999 is now expected to be less than 1.8 percent,
compared to 3 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Brazil's benchmark index, Bovespa, dropped 15.8
percent, its biggest decline in one day in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, foreign exchange reserves dropped to $55
billion, compared with $69 billion in early August.
</P>
<P>
   In a frantic attempt to stop capital from leaving the country,
Brazil's Central Bank hiked interest rates from 30 percent to
nearly 50 percent late Thursday. That followed an increase from 20
to 30 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
   The move appeared Friday to have stopped the drain on foreign
reserves, the government's best weapon against currency
devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil uses its supply of foreign currency to buy reals -- its
own currency -- in an effort to support the real's buying power in
the global arena. But such an action works only if the Central Bank
doesn't run out of so-called reserve currencies.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in interest rates followed the government's
announcement of emergency spending cuts earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   About $3.42 billion will be cut from social and infrastructure
spending this year and more cuts are planned in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   These moves are part of the government's effort to skirt a
possible recession with an all-out war on the deficit -- now more
than 7 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) -- that's considered
to be the Achilles heel of Brazil's economic recovery plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The steps we've taken are the appropriate macroeconomic answer
given the adverse climate,'' said Brazil's Finance Minister Pedro
Malan.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Asia's crisis began battering Brazil last October,
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who's favored to win
re-election on Oct. 4, has made it abundantly clear he's determined
to defend Brazil's currency at all costs.
</P>
<P>
   This has been good news for the rest of the region.
</P>
<P>
   When Mexico sharply devalued its peso in December 1994, it set
off an economic downslide in other countries that wounded U.S.
investors and cut U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
   Today, economic troubles in Brazil could easily portend troubles
in other nations such as Argentina, which relies on Brazil to buy
about a third of its exports.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Latin America is in a precarious economic position.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia, which has a ballooning deficit, like Brazil, ignored
the appeals of outside governments and devalued its currency by 9
percent last week.
</P>
<P>
   And, in neighboring Venezuela, investors are looking warily at
Hugo Chavez, who's poised to win December's presidential election.
Chavez led a failed coup attempt in 1992 and has talked of freezing
payments on foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are watching Brazil because of the tequila effect that
can happen when a crisis hits such a major economy,'' said Michael
Connolly, professor of international economics at the University of
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil's dismissed employees in the public sector and
privatized to get revenue,'' he added. ``I believe that the
fundamentals of the Brazilian economy are still pretty sound.''

BRAZIL GETS A CLOSE WATCH IN GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Sept. 13)   (SUBS grafs 8-9 with new Brazilian economic figures)   (EDS: Filed
in ``w'' and ``f'' and ``i'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Economists and government officials anxiously
surveying the global economic crisis are watching Brazil because of
concern that a currency devaluation there could throw Latin America
into recession and ultimately slow the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three major Latin American economies _ Brazil, Argentina
and Mexico _ Brazil is considered the most vulnerable to the
economic turmoil now engulfing Asia and Russia because of its large
federal budget deficit, a payments imbalance and huge government
debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil not only is the biggest of the three, not only is it
the one that all of South America is dependent on, but it has the
biggest deficiencies,'' said Lawrence Krohn, managing director for
research at Chase Securities in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are telling investors now that the risks have increased
tremendously over the last few weeks in Brazil,'' said Krohn.
``There is a structural vulnerability that makes Brazil a logical
target.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian government is attempting to fix those problems, in
particular the bulging budget deficit that is 7 percent of the
country's gross domestic product (GDP) _ and growing.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency said in its most recent
assessment of Brazil's economy that the country has made
significant fiscal reform to encourage free markets and foreign
investment. But it warned that high debt levels and budget deficits
were ``contributing to federal and state budget problems and a
surge in bankruptcies.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming on the heels of currency collapses in Asia and Russia,
investors are taking their money out of Brazil _ and other emerging
markets.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Sao Paulo stock exchange _ Latin America's
largest market _ lost nearly 40 percent of its value in August. By
Friday, the Brazilian market was down nearly 47 percent since the
beginning of the year, compared with the Dow Jones Industrial
Average, which closed Friday down about 3 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two weeks, the Brazilian government paid some $18
billion in cash reserves as investors cashed in holdings of
domestic currency, the real, for U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Although Brazil's robust $1.02 trillion economy dwarfs Russia's
$767 billion economy, both nations suffer similar problems: big
federal budget deficits and high domestic debt.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, the Yeltsin administration devalued the ruble after
the government defaulted on debt obligations, and investors lost
confidence that the government could correct the problems. The
Russian stock market lost much of its value in the melee.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Malaysia's recent decision to impose government
controls on the flow of capital has made investors nervous that
Brazil might follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The devaluation in Russia, combined with capital controls in
Malaysia, have caused a severe loss of confidence by Brazilian
investors in their own currency,'' said Jorge Mariscal, manager of
Latin American equity investments for Goldman Sachs in Brazil.
``We've got a very serious situation right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's problems are putting pressure on the government to
devalue the currency in order to stem the flow of capital.
</P>
<P>
   A currency devaluation would provide the temporary benefit of
making Brazil's exports less expensive on world markets. A
devaluation is considered a government's last resort to keep
investors from trading in domestic currency for U.S. dollars. The
main benefit is to make it more costly to give up the local
currency which then is worth less relative to the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Mariscal says prospects for devaluation of the real are growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A month ago, I would have said there was less than 10 percent
chance of devaluation. The chances now have maybe tripled,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian government has repeatedly said that it will not
devalue the currency. Rodrigo Santos, the head of financial policy
at the Brazilian Embassy in Washington, said the government is
making a major effort to cut the budget deficit and restore
investor confidence. Brazil also has raised interest rates to
provide an incentive for investors to stick with their Brazilian
holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's leaders are trying to keep the currency stable, at
about 1.18 reals for a dollar, even as holders of locally
denominated securities such as government bonds sell them to buy
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, such a sell-off would drive down the value of the
real. But Brazil has spent cash reserves of about $1.3 billion a
day for the last two weeks buying up domestic currency that
individuals, banks and company treasuries are unloading.
</P>
<P>
   A dramatic devaluation in Brazil would have ``an horrendous
impact'' across the region, said Krohn.
</P>
<P>
   It would unleash inflation because the cost of imports would
shoot up dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   It would lead currency speculators to sell off currency holdings
in Argentina ``and from there Mexico could get caught in the fall
out,'' Krohn said.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Argentina, which has a GDP of about $296 billion, is
closely linked to that of Brazil. The two are major trading
partners, with Brazil being Argentina's top export market; about 26
percent of Argentina's exports go there.
</P>
<P>
   If the Brazilian government devalued its currency, the real
would be worth less and therefore could buy fewer imports. That
would hurt Argentina's economy and put pressure on Argentine
officials to devalue the peso.
</P>
<P>
   Any devaluation in Brazil would pinch the United States because
Brazil would be able to afford fewer U.S. products. In 1997, Brazil
imported about $15.9 billion worth of American goods, a 25 percent
jump compared with 1996. The U.S. exports included automobiles,
computers, electronics and computer software.
</P>
<P>
   If economic unrest spread beyond Brazil to Argentina, Mexico and
other nations in Latin America, $133 billion in annual U.S. exports
could be at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Latin American leaders warned as much last week when they met
for a economic summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There exists a very serious worry in each of our countries
from what has occurred in these past weeks,'' Mexican President
Ernesto Zedillo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this continues, we would be at risk of the entire world
economy entering a state of recession,'' he said.

   MIAMI _ A dramatic interest rate hike eased fears Friday that
Brazil would be forced to devalue its currency, a move that would
have a domino effect on all of Latin America, a region that's
already been hard-hit by turmoil in Russia and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Shares on the Sao Paulo stock exchange jumped up 6 percent early
Friday, and analysts said it appeared that dollar flight had been
reversed for the first time in weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Stock and currency markets in Brazil had taken a bad beating
Thursday as jittery investors continued to yank money from emerging
markets that are considered more and more risky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latin America is being hit hard right now, but I think Brazil
is taking positive steps to keep a devaluation from happening,''
said Don Bowler, regional director for Latin America for the
Economist Intelligence Unit in London, an economic research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's $800 billion-a-year economy is twice the size of
Russia's, and nearly twice the size of Mexico's.
</P>
<P>
   If Brazil suffers, it will likely drag down other major U.S.
trading partners, and the United States will surely feel the pain.
</P>
<P>
   More than a fifth of all American exports -- or some $70.8
billion -- go to Mexico, Central and South America.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. banks have outstanding loans of some $16 billion to Brazil,
more than double their exposure to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   And Brazil expects to bring in $12 billion in U.S. investment
this year, a 50-percent jump over last year, from companies such as
Xerox Corp., Coca-Cola Co., and General Motors Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Continued turbulence in Asia and the devaluation of the ruble in
Russia have helped knock major Latin stock markets down by as much
as 72 percent in dollar terms this year.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, economists have trimmed growth estimates for the
region, particularly for next year. Average growth for Latin
America in 1999 is now expected to be less than 1.8 percent,
compared to 3 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Brazil's benchmark index, Bovespa, dropped 15.8
percent, its biggest decline in one day in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, foreign exchange reserves dropped to $55
billion, compared with $69 billion in early August.
</P>
<P>
   In a frantic attempt to stop capital from leaving the country,
Brazil's Central Bank hiked interest rates from 30 percent to
nearly 50 percent late Thursday. That followed an increase from 20
to 30 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
   The move appeared Friday to have stopped the drain on foreign
reserves, the government's best weapon against currency
devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil uses its supply of foreign currency to buy reals -- its
own currency -- in an effort to support the real's buying power in
the global arena. But such an action works only if the Central Bank
doesn't run out of so-called reserve currencies.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in interest rates followed the government's
announcement of emergency spending cuts earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   About $3.42 billion will be cut from social and infrastructure
spending this year and more cuts are planned in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   These moves are part of the government's effort to skirt a
possible recession with an all-out war on the deficit -- now more
than 7 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) -- that's considered
to be the Achilles heel of Brazil's economic recovery plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The steps we've taken are the appropriate macroeconomic answer
given the adverse climate,'' said Brazil's Finance Minister Pedro
Malan.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Asia's crisis began battering Brazil last October,
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who's favored to win
re-election on Oct. 4, has made it abundantly clear he's determined
to defend Brazil's currency at all costs.
</P>
<P>
   This has been good news for the rest of the region.
</P>
<P>
   When Mexico sharply devalued its peso in December 1994, it set
off an economic downslide in other countries that wounded U.S.
investors and cut U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
   Today, economic troubles in Brazil could easily portend troubles
in other nations such as Argentina, which relies on Brazil to buy
about a third of its exports.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Latin America is in a precarious economic position.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia, which has a ballooning deficit, like Brazil, ignored
the appeals of outside governments and devalued its currency by 9
percent last week.
</P>
<P>
   And, in neighboring Venezuela, investors are looking warily at
Hugo Chavez, who's poised to win December's presidential election.
Chavez led a failed coup attempt in 1992 and has talked of freezing
payments on foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are watching Brazil because of the tequila effect that
can happen when a crisis hits such a major economy,'' said Michael
Connolly, professor of international economics at the University of
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil's dismissed employees in the public sector and
privatized to get revenue,'' he added. ``I believe that the
fundamentals of the Brazilian economy are still pretty sound.''

BRAZIL GETS A CLOSE WATCH IN GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Sept. 13)   (SUBS grafs 8-9 with new Brazilian economic figures) 
 (EDS: Filed in ``w'' and ``f'' and ``i'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Economists and government officials anxiously
surveying the global economic crisis are watching Brazil because of
concern that a currency devaluation there could throw Latin America
into recession and ultimately slow the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three major Latin American economies _ Brazil, Argentina
and Mexico _ Brazil is considered the most vulnerable to the
economic turmoil now engulfing Asia and Russia because of its large
federal budget deficit, a payments imbalance and huge government
debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil not only is the biggest of the three, not only is it
the one that all of South America is dependent on, but it has the
biggest deficiencies,'' said Lawrence Krohn, managing director for
research at Chase Securities in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are telling investors now that the risks have increased
tremendously over the last few weeks in Brazil,'' said Krohn.
``There is a structural vulnerability that makes Brazil a logical
target.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian government is attempting to fix those problems, in
particular the bulging budget deficit that is 7 percent of the
country's gross domestic product (GDP) _ and growing.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency said in its most recent
assessment of Brazil's economy that the country has made
significant fiscal reform to encourage free markets and foreign
investment. But it warned that high debt levels and budget deficits
were ``contributing to federal and state budget problems and a
surge in bankruptcies.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming on the heels of currency collapses in Asia and Russia,
investors are taking their money out of Brazil _ and other emerging
markets.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Sao Paulo stock exchange _ Latin America's
largest market _ lost nearly 40 percent of its value in August. By
Friday, the Brazilian market was down nearly 47 percent since the
beginning of the year, compared with the Dow Jones Industrial
Average, which closed Friday down about 3 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two weeks, the Brazilian government paid some $18
billion in cash reserves as investors cashed in holdings of
domestic currency, the real, for U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Although Brazil's robust $1.02 trillion economy dwarfs Russia's
$767 billion economy, both nations suffer similar problems: big
federal budget deficits and high domestic debt.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, the Yeltsin administration devalued the ruble after
the government defaulted on debt obligations, and investors lost
confidence that the government could correct the problems. The
Russian stock market lost much of its value in the melee.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Malaysia's recent decision to impose government
controls on the flow of capital has made investors nervous that
Brazil might follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The devaluation in Russia, combined with capital controls in
Malaysia, have caused a severe loss of confidence by Brazilian
investors in their own currency,'' said Jorge Mariscal, manager of
Latin American equity investments for Goldman Sachs in Brazil.
``We've got a very serious situation right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's problems are putting pressure on the government to
devalue the currency in order to stem the flow of capital.
</P>
<P>
   A currency devaluation would provide the temporary benefit of
making Brazil's exports less expensive on world markets. A
devaluation is considered a government's last resort to keep
investors from trading in domestic currency for U.S. dollars. The
main benefit is to make it more costly to give up the local
currency which then is worth less relative to the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Mariscal says prospects for devaluation of the real are growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A month ago, I would have said there was less than 10 percent
chance of devaluation. The chances now have maybe tripled,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian government has repeatedly said that it will not
devalue the currency. Rodrigo Santos, the head of financial policy
at the Brazilian Embassy in Washington, said the government is
making a major effort to cut the budget deficit and restore
investor confidence. Brazil also has raised interest rates to
provide an incentive for investors to stick with their Brazilian
holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's leaders are trying to keep the currency stable, at
about 1.18 reals for a dollar, even as holders of locally
denominated securities such as government bonds sell them to buy
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, such a sell-off would drive down the value of the
real. But Brazil has spent cash reserves of about $1.3 billion a
day for the last two weeks buying up domestic currency that
individuals, banks and company treasuries are unloading.
</P>
<P>
   A dramatic devaluation in Brazil would have ``an horrendous
impact'' across the region, said Krohn.
</P>
<P>
   It would unleash inflation because the cost of imports would
shoot up dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   It would lead currency speculators to sell off currency holdings
in Argentina ``and from there Mexico could get caught in the fall
out,'' Krohn said.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Argentina, which has a GDP of about $296 billion, is
closely linked to that of Brazil. The two are major trading
partners, with Brazil being Argentina's top export market; about 26
percent of Argentina's exports go there.
</P>
<P>
   If the Brazilian government devalued its currency, the real
would be worth less and therefore could buy fewer imports. That
would hurt Argentina's economy and put pressure on Argentine
officials to devalue the peso.
</P>
<P>
   Any devaluation in Brazil would pinch the United States because
Brazil would be able to afford fewer U.S. products. In 1997, Brazil
imported about $15.9 billion worth of American goods, a 25 percent
jump compared with 1996. The U.S. exports included automobiles,
computers, electronics and computer software.
</P>
<P>
   If economic unrest spread beyond Brazil to Argentina, Mexico and
other nations in Latin America, $133 billion in annual U.S. exports
could be at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Latin American leaders warned as much last week when they met
for a economic summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There exists a very serious worry in each of our countries
from what has occurred in these past weeks,'' Mexican President
Ernesto Zedillo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this continues, we would be at risk of the entire world
economy entering a state of recession,'' he said.

AIR FORCE GROUNDS TRAINING CRAFT PENDING SAFETY REVIEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SIG CHRISTENSON  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The Air Force's trouble-plagued T-3 ``Firefly,''
grounded 13 months ago after an engine mysteriously failed during a
training flight, may not fly again this year.
</P>
<P>
   The British-made training aircraft, used to screen Air Force
pilot candidates at Colorado Springs, Colo., and Hondo, Texas, has
been ordered placed on ``minimal maintenance status.''
</P>
<P>
   The term means the plane will be maintained only enough to
prevent deterioration, Dave Smith, a spokesman for the Air
Education and Training Command at Randolph Air Force Base, said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He said the T-3, a two-seat, single-engine, propeller-driven
plane, could be out of service through December because of the time
required to acquire new parts, make modifications and allow the
Federal Aviation Administration to recertify the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not going to fly until we get a supplemental-type
certification from the FAA and they're modified to meet that
supplemental certification,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force's inventory of 110 T-3s has remained on the ground
since the service's flight-screening program was suspended
following the abrupt stoppage of an engine July 23, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A military instructor pilot and student aboard that plane landed
safely at the Air Force Academy's landing strip.
</P>
<P>
   An Air Force investigation into the cause of the engine stoppage
found ``several interrelated problems in the fuel system,'' Smith
said, adding that he could not elaborate because he lacked other
details.
</P>
<P>
   Three flight instructors and three students have been killed in
three crashes since the Firefly went into service four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   All the crashes were in Colorado, with two attributed to pilot
error.
</P>
<P>
   A third crash occurred because of a ``stall condition'' from
which the pilot was unable to recover.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known if the stall was intentional as part of training
or accidental.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 of the planes assigned to Hondo, where civilian
instructors conduct the screening, rest under protective hail
sheds.
</P>
<P>
   The T-3 replaced the T-41, a modified Cessna 172, starting in
1994. It has been used exclusively to screen pilot candidates
before they are accepted for undergraduate training at three bases.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force initially halted screening and instead allowed
pilot candidates to directly enter flight school.
</P>
<P>
   But a ``significantly'' higher attrition rate prompted the
service to map plans for screening pilot candidates at private
flight schools later this year, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force also is seeking a study on the feasibility of
installing an ejection-seat system in the T-3 within the next two
years. Pilots in the plane wear parachutes.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Air Force had hoped to have the plane back in service
last month, it took longer than anticipated to identify and correct
the problem, and then give a T-3 to the FAA for testing, Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA recently received a modified Firefly and has been
conducting tests in Waco, Texas, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we have figured it out and that's what the FAA is
testing it for now, to validate that we found the problem and have
a fix,'' Smith said.

   NY-MORTIMERS (New York) _ Up and down Park Avenue this week,
among the crowd that passes for the 1990s version of the Social
400, a wail went up: Where will we eat now that Mortimer's is
closed? The restaurant beneath the brown awning at 75th Street and
Lexington Avenue was shut on Tuesday after the death of its owner,
Glenn Bernbaum. Since 1976, he had been the host and gatekeeper of
perhaps the clubbiest public restaurant in the United States, icily
indifferent to those he didn't know but dapper and welcoming to

   Forrest Gump got a big laugh when he told President Kennedy, ``I
gotta pee,'' when he visited the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The big-hearted, slow-witted football star in the movie
``Forrest Gump'' presumably went straight to the bathroom after

it's no laughing matter for many workers who don't have the chance

use the bathroom until recently, said Marc Linder, co-author of the
book, ``Void Where Prohibited: Rest Breaks and the Right to Urinate
on Company Time.'' Linder is a professor of law at the University
of Iowa in Iowa City.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is especially troublesome for poultry processors,
delivery drivers and school teachers who can't leave production
lines, their trucks or classrooms for a pit stop, he said.
Consequently, many wear adult diapers at work.
</P>
<P>
   Only seven states have laws that mandate breaks for both rest
and meals, and only one state, Minnesota, requires employers to
give workers time off to use the bathroom. (An employee who worked
at a photo kiosk was forbidden to close up to use a nearby
bathroom, and complained to a Minnesota legislator who passed a law
requiring a 10-minute bathroom break every four hours.)
</P>
<P>
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration always has
required employers to provide toilets, but it has only been since
April that the agency has taken the position that employers must
give workers access to the toilets, said Linder, who said he had to
badger OSHA officials to make the policy directive. Linder got
interested in bathroom breaks after hearing complaints from
employees at a New Mexico dairy who worked 12-hour shifts without a
break.
</P>
<P>
   After encountering employers in the poultry processing industry
who believed OSHA rules didn't require them to provide toilet
access, OSHA came out with an interpretation that employers have to
provide access to toilets, said Debbie Berkowitz, health and safety
consultant for the United Food and Commercial Workers Union in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA doesn't track complaints by subject matter, but
investigators said bathroom access complaints aren't frequent, said
spokeswoman Susan Fleming.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   It's obviously uncomfortable if you can't go to the bathroom
when you feel the urge. There's also a big health risk over time of
bladder infections, incontinence, distention of the bladder and, in
extreme cases, renal poisoning, said Linder. His co-author, Ingrid
Nygaard, is an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at
the University of Iowa who had seen a number of patients with
bladder problems whose bathroom breaks were restricted.
</P>
<P>
   In its policy memo from April, OSHA cited medical studies that
show the importance of regular urination. Pregnant women who have
urinary tract infections have lower birthweight babies who are at
risk for additional health problems. Evidence also shows that
individuals who delay defecation suffer such health problems as
constipation, abdominal pain, diverticulitis and hemorrhoids.
</P>
<P>
   Gayle Fallon, president of the Houston Federation of Teachers,
said teachers, especially those who teach elementary school, have a
greater incidence of urinary tract infections because they're in a
classroom with their children for several hours at a time. It's
hard to get a substitute to take over, so teachers only call for
help during an emergency, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fallon said she used to have frequent urinary tract infections
when she taught the fifth grade. To stop the urge to urinate,
Fallon said she didn't drink liquids during the day, which only
made the infections worse and more frequent.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Linder said Nygaard, surveyed school teachers in Iowa and found
that 11 percent of elementary school teachers who taught in schools
without teacher's aides took their entire class with them to the
bathroom. Many wear adult diapers.
</P>
<P>
   Three percent of female school teachers also reported that
during the peak of their monthly cycle they don't go to school
because they don't have ready access to a bathroom, Linder said.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't surprise Fallon, who said teachers with any type of
diarrhea or bladder infections often call in sick. They can't get
up every 10 minutes because they don't have access to a bathroom,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fallon said the problem sometimes becomes so acute that she has
had to defend teachers who've been disciplined for leaving their
class to go to the bathroom.

READER'S E-MAIL PROVIDES ANSWER TO ERROR MESSAGE IN WINDOWS 95 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I've been having an occasional problem with my Windows 95
computer. Sometimes when I start it up, I get an error message
telling me that it's having problems loading a file named
VMM32.VXD. I can usually click past the error message and
everything's fine, but sometimes I have to reboot. Do you know
what's wrong?
</P>
<P>
   A: I have received this complaint from several readers over the
past few months, but I couldn't find an answer to the problem
anywhere. I recently received an e-mail from another reader who
cleared it up. Here's his contribution:
</P>
<P>
   ``For many months now, I have had intermittent problems with
`Bad or Missing vmm32.vxd' messages on bootup, both under Windows
95 and Windows 98. I assumed the problem was self-induced, but
couldn't get to what it may have been, until just the other day
when visiting the Umax website
(support.umax.com/drivers/index.shtml) to routinely check for any
possible Win98 driver updates for my Astra 1200S scanner. ... There
was a patch for people with this problem, but (it) addressed only
those with Pentiums running at 300 Mhz or faster. I run an AMD 233
Mhz K6, and so far, the patch has fixed my problem, too. Here's
Umax's reply to my e-mail informing them that an AMD cpu can also
apply:
</P>
<P>
   `Thank you for the e-mail. ... You are right, this problem does
occur with slower processors, but at a very low percentage. We are
well aware of the problem. The UMAXIS.EXE patch WILL fix your
problem with VMM32.VXD on boot-up.'''
</P>
<P>
   With the popularity of low-priced scanners in the home market,
more and more users are discovering just how finicky these devices
can be. If you install a scanner and begin to see unusual behavior
in your PC, it's not a bad idea to visit d}~?!}Y scan+.m[Xu QUId

IRVIN SINGING PRAISES OF GAILEY'S PLAN 
RESEND FOR ALL NEEDING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Blame Michael Irvin for another thing. As Randy
Moss wows the snowplow drivers in Minnesota, let it be remembered
that the Cowboys had a valid reason for passing up Moss in the
draft. Michael had already pushed the franchise way beyond the
limit on image disasters.
</P>
<P>
   A chance couldn't be taken on Moss, him being of questionable
character, because Michael had burned so many chances.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, there's the good side of Irvin, which has
always been the football side. Few in the NFL are better at what
they do and how they go about preparing themselves to do it.
</P>
<P>
   And what Irvin does goes beyond being a pass catcher of the
highest NFL quality. Irvin also leads at Valley Ranch. Many others
follow. Is that scary? Only if those many others don't follow him
down the street.
</P>
<P>
   Do as Mike does on the practice field, and on the game field.
Then wave goodbye as he roars off into the city night.
</P>
<P>
   But back to that good side _ Irvin quickly became one of the
biggest locker room boosters of Chan Gailey. Football, like
politics, does create strange bedfellows, so to speak. During Jerry
Jones' coaching search in January and February, it was Irvin who
repeatedly reminded Jones that no matter whom Jones hired, ``just
make sure it puts a smile back on Troy's \RAikman\S face.''
</P>
<P>
   But yesterday at Valley Ranch, it was Irvin who wore the widest
smile when talking about the immediate impact Gailey's new
offensive system made against the Arizona Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Irvin, and the Cowboys, didn't prosper using the
previous offense, ``But I think we all realized it was time for a
change, and then when you go to something different, there is
always a question of how will everyone adjust,'' Irvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Those nine catches for 119 yards Sunday gave Irvin the
appearance of a reborn receiver at age 32. With Gailey's offense,
Irvin has more freedom and, if Aikman's protection is adequate, a
tad more time to work on a cornerback. In this case that cornerback
was Aeneas Williams, who has snuffed Michael in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps just as important was that wideouts (Ernie Mills and
Billy Davis) other than Irvin also made an impact, plus the running
game was successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've still got a lot to prove, starting with Denver this
week,'' Irvin said, ``but I'm not going to try and downplay how
much the Arizona game meant to us, as a team. It was so big.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin's explanation of how big went like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``For all these weeks, even months, we've been listening to the
man \RGailey\S say, `If you do this, this and this, then because of
the offense, you will see this, this and this start to open up for
you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a slow process in the preseason, and we had a slow
start against Arizona. But we kept doing all of the this, this and
this Chan has repeatedly talked about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure enough, this, this and this began to happen to them on
defense. Those things Chan told us would happen, did happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the last couple of days here \RValley Ranch\S, the fellows
are sitting around in groups talking, and you hear the same thing
over and over again _ that the man told us all this, and he was
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Gone in a hurry was the thought that it would take four or five
games before Gailey's offense would have a chance to prove its
worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Team confidence started building right away,'' Irvin said.
``For all of us, the first thought is to do what he \RGailey\S
says. Respect like that is a very powerful thing. It gives us an
added edge, not just for Denver but on down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, obvious doubt surfaced in some quarters
immediately after game one. Because success came against Arizona,
what does that really prove? Let it be noted, however, that the
Cardinals left the field shocked about the outcome. They had come
to Texas Stadium expecting to win, and postgame comments from the
losing dressing room indicated as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teams don't think of us like they once did,'' Irvin said.
``But lately, we haven't been thinking of ourselves like we once
did. We needed a game like we had Sunday _ really needed it.''
</P>
<P>
   When working properly, Gailey's offense will develop around the
running game setting up the air attack. Against Arizona, it was the
opposite. But the Cowboys have no reason to be picky about success.
</P>
<P>
   An old hand like Irvin was in the middle of something good in
that win. And if Irvin is right, the good carried over into the
work week at Valley Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Who needed Randy Moss anyway?
</P>

IN CALIFORNIA RACE, REPUBLICAN RAISES THE CHARACTER ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ What do investment tax credits and Monica
Lewinsky have in common? Republican gubernatorial candidate Dan
Lungren has an answer: his Democratic opponent, Lt. Gov. Gray
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few weeks, Lungren plans to carefully weave the
issue of character into his major campaign speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren, the current state attorney general, gave his first big
speech on the economy Thursday, calling for new business tax cuts
and eliminating the state vehicle license fee.
</P>
<P>
   The speech, which contained only a few new proposals, started
out by hammering the ``tax-and-spend crowd,'' then veered off to
the issue of character.
</P>
<P>
   The course change was planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``As some of you may know,'' Lungren casually told the crowd of
about 200 Sacramento Metro Chamber of Commerce members, ``I've also
been talking some about character these days. In truth, character
and any issue of public policy _ even the economy _ are
inextricably linked together. Character is about standing up for
what you believe in even when the pressure is on. ... That's the
way I've lived my public life.''
</P>
<P>
   Lungren was not accusing Davis, even indirectly, of being an
adulterer or a liar. But he criticized Davis Thursday for lacking
the character to take a stand on important issues, like the North
American Free Trade Agreement, during a recent debate in Fresno.
Lungren told the Sacramento audience that ``standing up for what's
right regardless of the consequences is the truest test of
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Lungren also has started running television commercials on the
character issue, without making any direct links to his Democratic
opponent. The 30-second spot, titled ``Character,'' first began
airing in San Diego and the Central Valley, and is now running in
the San Francisco Bay area.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't tell people to do one thing while you do another,''
Lungren says to the camera. ``From the White House to the school
house, from parent to principal, that's what we ought to be talking
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Lungren isn't the only candidate using the character issue in
tough races this year. Republicans elsewhere have been exploiting
the Clinton sex scandal in television and radio spots.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' strongest link to Clinton is money. President Clinton
went to California on Aug. 18 and helped Davis raise $3 million for
his campaign. Davis spokesman Michael Bustamante said the president
did not plan any more fund-raisers for Davis before the Nov. 3
election, although Clinton is expected to raise money for the
Democratic National Committee in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Bustamante scoffed at Lungren's attempt to link Clinton's
character with the California campaign. He said Lungren was just
``pounding on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wishful thinking to say character is the issue that will
drown out all the important issues that Californians care about:
education, choice, the environment, assault weapons,'' Bustamante
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is character having the temerity to talk about education, when
in Congress you voted against Head Start and to abolish the
Department of Education and to cut $1 billion in education
funding?'' Bustamante added. ``It's a type of character all
right.''
</P>
<P>
   After his Sacramento appearance, Lungren was asked whether his
mentioning character was an oblique reference to Davis. ``No, it's
not oblique,'' he said to laughter. ``Look, we had thought from the
very beginning that this campaign would not revolve around one
outstanding issue, but rather be a constellation of issues, and in
the final analysis people truly would be making judgments about
character.''
</P>
<P>
   During his speech Thursday, Lungren cut out whole sections that
directly attacked Davis, including a paragraph where he said Davis
was ``suspicious of parents and wants to empower the bureaucracy,''
according to a copy of the speech handed to reporters in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren later said he simply hadn't had time to get to that
section, and he promised that everything raised in the original
version of the speech would be aired throughout the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But he clearly wasn't afraid to make the link between Davis and
Clinton, when asked. ``I would just say this: I didn't invite the
president to come here and campaign with me.''

 &HT;    PRIMAKOV BEGINS TO FORM NEW GOVERNMENT WITH COMMUNISTS
 &HT;    (EDs: Optional add begins at 550 words.)
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The new prime minister Yevgeny Primakov, confirmed by a
lopsided majority in parliament Friday, began to assemble
post-Soviet Russia's first coalition government which includes
Communists in senior positions.
</P>
<P>
   In a further sign of the power yielded by a weakened President
Boris Yeltsin, the new government will include two former
Soviet-era central planners in key roles to supervise policy on the
tattered economy.
</P>
<P>
   The new economic team appeared likely to print more money to pay
massive government debts and impose state controls in an attempt to
weather the current financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The confirmation of Primakov by a 315-63 vote of the Duma, the
lower house of parliament, ended a three-week-long power vacuum but
raised new questions about Russia's commitment to Western-style
economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Communist Yuri Maslyukov, 60, as first deputy
prime minister and Viktor Gerashchenko, 60, as the central bank
chairman alarmed Western investors and analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Maslyukov -- who served under Mikhail Gorbachev as head of
Gosplan, the mammoth Soviet agency in charge of economic planning
-- to the senior post of deputy prime minister, represents the
Kremlin's first attempt to share power with the Communists since
the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have neither fresh ideas or energy,'' said Igor
Semenenko, a Russian investment analyst at Centre Invest.
</P>
<P>
   As a former Soviet central banker and head of Russia's central
bank from 1992-94, Gerashchenko was widely blamed for fueling
inflation with huge credits to ailing industry and agriculture and
printing rubles. Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard economist and former
adviser to the Kremlin, once called him ``the worst central banker
in world.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerashchenko replaced Sergei Dubinin, who resigned earlier this
week under intense criticism after the central bank spent $9
billion in July and August trying to support the ruble, only to see
the currency crash in value in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, 68, a former KGB spymaster with little economic
experience of his own, denied that his government would return to
Soviet-style economic control. He said temporary measures would be
necessary to allow Russia to resume its reform efforts in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country is in such a condition that we will have to do
everything to stop a future fall so that Russia can see growth,''
Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
   He compared the stern measures necessary for overcoming Russia's
economic turmoil to the emergency steps taken by the American
government during the Great Depression of 1929.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov instantly brought a sense of stability to Russian
politics which had been crippled by a power struggle between the
Kremlin and the opposition-led Duma after Yeltsin abruptly fired
the government last month.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, the former foreign minister, called on Russia's
quarrelsome political factions to cooperate in the urgent need to
halt the country's dangerous economic decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need unity to come out of this very grave crisis,'' he told
the Duma. ``Do not expect to continue political confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   Without unity, he cautioned, ``we are facing a serious danger of
our country fragmenting.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Primakov appointed his deputy at the foreign ministry, Igor
Ivanov, as Russia's new foreign minister. He reappointed Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev and Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin to
their jobs controlling the army and internal security forces.
</P>
<P>
   But Primakov's emerging government signaled a shift decidedly to
the past, away from the free-market reforms sought by the United
States and other donor countries that have given Russia billions of
dollars in aid to pursue in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not another penny'' of International Monetary Fund or other
Western aid, predicted one Western diplomat upon hearing the news
of the appointments.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to demonstrate his involvement in the changes,
Yeltsin went on nationwide television before the confirmation vote
to reassure Russians that Primakov could rescue the country from
its economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tasks facing the government are difficult -- to get prices
down, to return goods to the shelves, restore the banking system
and guarantee deposits,'' Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said he would continue
to pursue Yeltsin's impeachment in the Duma, however most political
analysts said the attempt had little chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is going on here is a collusion between the president and
the Communists, to allow (the president) to stay in power by
backtracking on democratic reforms and free-market economy. We view
the latest developments as a communist coup,'' said Konstantin
Borovoi, an independent liberal lawmaker.

NEW INKJET PRINTERS LET COLOR DO THE TALKING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Color inkjets have become the printers of choice for most folks
who use computers at home, as well as small businesses on a tight
budget. That's because modern inkjets can produce razor-sharp text
and photo-quality color for less than $400 _ sometimes, a lot less.
</P>
<P>
   Not that inkjet printers don't have their drawbacks. They can be
very expensive _ ink cartridges run in the $20-$75 range and don't
last long if you use your printer regularly. If you're planning to
print photo-quality graphics, expect to pay more than $25 for about
50 sheets of glossy paper.
</P>
<P>
   Compare that to the cost of a quality color laser printer, and
there's no contest. Color laser printers run thousands of dollars,
though even those prices are dropping fast.
</P>
<P>
   Epson and Canon are two printer makers trying to catch the
market leader, Hewlett-Packard. I've long been a fan of both
companies' printers, and their latest products don't disappoint.
They produce excellent images, and you couldn't go wrong with
either brand.
</P>
<P>
   There's one nagging aspect to each of these, though, that I
found quite irritating. One of the things that many computer users
do to make their lives easier is to put their PCs and peripherals
on a power strip. After properly shutting down the operating
system, the power strips can then be used to turn off the entire
system.
</P>
<P>
   Both the printers reviewed here required their own shutdown
process _ the manuals for each warned against using a power strip
to turn them off. You must push the OFF button; then each printer
spends about 15 seconds grunting and grinding as it prepares to
power down. Is this really necessary?
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   Stylus Color 850 _ $350, Epson America. Epson has long been my
favorite brand of printer, thanks to its zippy performance and
bright, vivid colors. Some reviewers complain that Epson's approach
to color results in images that are a bit too vivid, but I like
this look.
</P>
<P>
   The Stylus Color 850 is aimed at small businesses and home
offices, but it's great for general home use as well, particularly
if you value speed and the ability to print photo-quality images.
Epson claims this is its fastest inkjet printer, which is why it's
priced higher than its other models.
</P>
<P>
   The 850 prints at a maximum resolution of 1,440-by-720 dots per
inch, and does so fairly quickly. I printed a 3-by-4-inch digital
photograph of a child's face with photo-quality settings, and it
printed in just under two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting image was a bit brighter than the original on my
screen, but I was able to tweak the settings to darken it with
Epson's easy-to-use color adjustments, which are built into the
printer driver. Changing the settings didn't alter the printing
speed.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, though, you won't be using this high setting. I
moved the quality back a notch to the 850's defaults, then printed
the Houston Chronicle's main Web page (www.houstonchronicle.com)
from Sept. 8. It took two sheets to print the mix of text and
images, and did so in 50 seconds. A single page of double-spaced
text took about 18 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The 850 doesn't require special ink cartridges to work its
photo-quality magic. The same cartridges you use to print
black-and-white letters can also be used to print photos.
</P>
<P>
   The software that comes with the 850 is excellent. Epson has
taken a cue from Lexmark's printer drivers and added an ink-level
indicator. You can tell at a glance whether you're going to need
new cartridges. It also includes versions of Broderbund's The Print
Shop and MetaCreation's Kai's Photo Soap.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   BJC-5000 _ $250, Canon Computer Systems. Canon continues to
improve on its already-excellent line of home printers. The
BJC-5000 is faster than earlier models, its images have a crisper
look, and it comes with an excellent software bundle.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Epson Color Stylus 850, the BJC-5000 prints at a
maximum resolution of 1,400-by-720 dpi. Canon's approach to color
is more realistic-looking than Epson's, but the result on paper is
that it appears a bit duller.
</P>
<P>
   The BJC-5000, while faster than earlier Canons, is nowhere near
as fast as the Epson. Printing the 4-by-3 color picture in
photo-quality color took more than five minutes. The Chronicle Web
page took nearly 3 1/2 minutes. And the page of black-and-white
text took about 25 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The BJC-5000 uses different kinds of ink cartridges for
different types of printing. That means you must swap out its dual
cartridges when you switch from everyday printing to photo-quality
output, which can be aggravating if you do it a lot. The Canon
printer driver wants you to go through the print-head-alignment
process after every cartridge swap, as well, which further slows
you down.
</P>
<P>
   But the results can be worth it. The cartridge combination for
best photo quality includes a single cartridge with four ink
colors, and a second ``tank'' that holds a pair of smaller
cartridges _ one color, one black. The resulting prints are rich
and very realistic.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of its printer driver, which is comparatively
rudimentary, the Canon software bundle is one of the best around.
Canon includes its Create 3 suite, which features color control
software, a greeting card package, image manipulation software, a
set of Internet utilities and more.

EMMY-AWARDS (Los Angeles) _ When the industry first decided to
congratulate itself with a golden trophy, the trinket had no clout.
Hardly anyone even knew what an Emmy was, let alone why they should
care. Fifty years later, the Emmy has become one of the most
influential characters in Hollywood, going from nonfactor to icon.
By Keith Marder. 
. 
EMMY-PICKS (Los Angeles) _ Put away the crystal ball. Hang up on
your personal astrologer. Even alien intelligence won't help get
inside the heads of Emmy voters (sorry, Scully and Mulder), whose
voting patterns are as predictable as the winning lottery numbers.
Critics everywhere try every year, but the Emmy, she's got a mind
of her own. By Keith Marder. 
. 
EMMY-TV (Los Angeles) _ A million dollars to the one who can guess
who will host of Sunday night's Emmy telecast. Make it $2 million.
Make it as many million as you want, because there is no host for
the four-hour broadcast (7 p.m. on NBC). By Keith Marder. 
. 
EMMY-FIRST (Los Angeles) _ Shirley Dinsdale didn't want to go to a
television industry banquet on Jan. 25, 1949. She had a hot date
and no desire to go to something called the Emmy Awards at the
Hollywood Athletic Club, sit at a folding lawn table and waste a
Tuesday night. Dinsdale and her sidekick, puppet Judy Splinters,
were done for another day and about to take off when her bosses at
KTLA told her she had to go to an evening event to represent the
station. By Keith Marder. 
. 
DIGITAL-COMPUTERS (Los Angeles) _ So you love SPAM, the hearty if
unclassifiable ``luncheon meat'' in a can. But you hate spam, the
omnipresent but unmentionable junk e-mail in your computer. Well,
friend, this is your lucky week. The Hormel Food Corp. has unveiled

   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; What? You didn't get your invitation to the
Governors Ball? Miz Hot Tips didn't either, and she really doesn't
mind, but she'd love to snag one of the party favors at the gala
following the Emmy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   According to the party planners, each guest will get to take
home a hand-blown commemorative glass ornament by Christopher Radko
that features a tiny Emmy statuette design on a pale blue
background to hang on the Christmas tree. In case you're wondering
what the big deal is, ordinary Radko ornaments cost $40 and up.

   SUNDAY IN PARIS: Just for a day, wear a beret and take in the
sights, sounds, fashions and food of France without leaving L.A.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the annual Colbert Festival comes to Beverly Hills,
and all along Rodeo Drive craftsmen from the top French luxury
houses will be on hand to demonstrate their unique talents. Finally
you can talk about life on the Continent with your well-traveled
friends and talk with authority about how they make Chanel perfume
and Hermes ``Kelly'' bags. Hours are 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., and the
event is free.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S GOOD MANNERS: You've finally been invited to the boss's
house for dinner _ and there's that little fork at the top of the
plate (it's for dessert), plus two forks on the left. If only you'd
listened to the latest installment of the Instant Genius cassettes
by etiquette expert Letita Baldrige. It's a 60-minute tape to keep
you from making all kinds of social faux pas in the areas of table
manners, introductions, thank you notes, and even body language.
The cassette is $12 and the CD is $13 at Barnes &AMP; Noble and Borders
Books &AMP; Music stores.
</P>
<P>
   STAR-STRUCK PRODUCTS: Miz Hot Tips wonders how many celebs who
endorse products actually use them. For instance, she's seen
Jacklyn Smith shopping at Neiman Marcus a couple of times, and she
knows the store does not sell her line of clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, for those who do follow the stars, Cybill Shepherd is
the newest Ultima II spokesperson and starting today she'll be
hawking Glowtion skin brightening moisturizer on TV. You can find
the moisturizer at J.C. Penney and several upscale drugstores.
</P>
<P>
   Now, to appeal to those not yet worried about wrinkles or age
spots, Covergirl cosmetics has hired pop icon Brandy as its
spokesgirl. And she's even singing the company's praises in
television commercials already airing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jane Seymour is busy advertising do-it-yourself hair
color. It apparently improved her appearance, as the Dallas
International Apparel Mart is going to honor her on Oct. 16 with
its annual Personal Style Award.
</P>
<P>
   And thanks in part to Monica Lewinsky and the Prez, Zegna ties
are now a household name. On Oct. 11, the Italian menswear company
will be in the spotlight again, but this time as the presenting
sponsor of the eighth annual Environmental Media Association
Awards. They'll be held at Will Rogers State Historic Park in
Pacific Palisades.
</P>
<P>
   MALL PATROL: Bloomingdale's in Fashion Square mall in Sherman
Oaks is planning an exhibit of Judith Leiber purses and they'd like
to borrow yours. Honest. Store publicist Kayla Pressman says to
call her at (818) 325-2213 by Monday if you'd like to participate
in the exhibit that runs Wednesday through Sept. 24. Your name will
be printed on a card next to the Leiber purse _ those signature
crystal-covered evening bags _ so your friends will see it. And,
yes, you get it back.
</P>
<P>
   Over at the Glendale Galleria at 12:30 and 2:30 p.m. Sept. 19,
there's going to be a big deal fashion show for free. The sponsor
is the Acrylic Council, so Miz Hot Tips doubts you'll see cashmere
sweaters or wool suits.

2 FACES OF SPAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ So you love SPAM, the hearty if unclassifiable
``luncheon meat'' in a can. But you hate spam, the omnipresent but
unmentionable junk e-mail in your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Well this is your lucky week. The Hormel Food Corp. has unveiled
a Web site celebrating all things SPAM, with lots of whizzy
animations of flying SPAM cans, an overview of SPAM history, cool
SPAM boxer shorts and bean-bag toys you can buy, a ``SPAM Cam,''
stories and recipes about the stuff, even an advice column.
</P>
<P>
   You can also order a SPAM cookbook, submit recipes, enter
cooking competitions, organize SPAM parties and even inquire about
Hormel's job opportunities for the truly SPAM-obsessed.
</P>
<P>
   The SPAM folks also take time to explain their position on SPAM
vs. spam, also known as unsolicited commercial e-mail or UCE.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not object to use of this slang term to describe UCE,
although we do object to the use of our product image in
association with that term. Also, if the term is to be used, it
should be used in all lower-case letters to distinguish it from our
trademark SPAM, which should be used with all upper-case letters.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of lower-case spam, Gov. Pete Wilson is mulling two
bills designed to keep you from getting overwhelmed by junk, uh,
UCE. The governor has until Sept. 30 to decide whether to sign,
veto or let them pass into law without his signature, but he is not
expected to announce a decision on either before this weekend, a
staff member said.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Bill 1676 comes from Assemblywoman Debra Bowen,
D-Torrance, who has sponsored a series of laudable Internet-related
bills over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   Her bill requires spammers sending mail through California-based
servers to label their missives with ``ADV'' in the subject header,
so readers know what they're getting. That also will allow people
who have e-mail filtering capabilities to zap the stuff before it
ever gets to their eyeballs.
</P>
<P>
   Spammers also must provide a legitimate return address, and if a
spammee notifies them to stop sending, they could face a
$500-per-message criminal fine, according to Bowen.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen modeled the bill on the 5-year-old ban on junk faxes,
which requires a legitimate fax-back number, her staff said.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Gary Miller, R-City of Industry, takes the opposite
approach to spam eradication in his AB 1629.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of allowing individual spam recipients to go to the
district attorney, his bill clarifies the damages that an Internet
service provider such as America Online or Earthlink (two service
providers who have been aggressively anti-spam) can obtain in civil
court proceedings against a spamming company: $50 per message.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really makes it an open-shut, slam-dunk case, instead of
having to patch it together from a bunch of other laws,'' said
Miller's legislative aide, John Cusey.
</P>
<P>
   The two bills ``kind of represent the two poles of dealing with
the problem,'' Cusey said. Only Washington and Nevada currently
have laws dealing with spam, while efforts to pass a federal
standard have foundered on a variety of free speech and other
issues so far.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson normally says little about whether he will back a bill
until he announces a final decision. But Cusey said Wilson staffers
who will make a recommendation on the anti-spam legislation have
said at least Miller's bill probably will become law.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Good Will Hunting'' portrayed the lighter side of tortured
young math geniuses, then ``Pi'' is its very dark opposite.
</P>
<P>
   The black-and-white independent film stars Sean Gullette as an
intense, lone computer wizard riven by paranoia and pain and driven
to isolate a 216-digit number that can unlock untold riches and the
true name of God _ if it doesn't kill him or his machines first.
</P>
<P>
   The film somehow fuses the ancient Asian game of Go, the New
York Stock Exchange, the Kabbalah and Jewish numerology, migraines,
Fibonacci numbers and electronica music. It's gorgeously shot and
edited, with a terrific techno soundtrack bubbling under a
fascinating stew of ideas and images.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site, at www.pithemovie.com, is equally intriguing and
equally attractive graphically. Put together by Gullette, who also
co-wrote the film's story line, the site briefly explains each of
the aforementioned intriguing subjects and provides links for more
information.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there's a relatively concise two-year diary
detailing director Darren Aronofsky's challenges in financing,
shooting and selling the film, leading up to its inclusion in the
Sundance Film Festival, where he won an award for best direction.
</P>
<P>
   I particularly recommend to anyone the section on the game Go,
which I've long loved but play only poorly. Its simple rules and
endless permutations, as the Web site points out, make it difficult
for computers, much less humans, to master. But its challenges are
ever fortifying, even in an age of technology, and even for someone
who enjoys all that technological entertainment has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   What is flubber made of? What was the inspiration for the
character Goofy? And what film inspired Disneyland's Jungle
Adventure ride?
</P>
<P>
   If you can answer these questions, you may be spending too much
time tracking the Big Mouse and all his doings. On the other hand,
you'll do really well in a new CD-ROM game from Disney Interactive
called the D Show.
</P>
<P>
   It's a handsomely done trivia game focused on, of course, all
things Disney, and, as such, is best for those with more than a bit
of a fixation on the world's largest rodent company. But the game
has some very nice touches and should prove quite entertaining for
the rest of us as well.
</P>
<P>
   The game is Disney's answer to the wildly successful You Don't
Know Jack series of computer and Internet trivia titles (the online
game is free to play, awards prizes and is available at
www.bezerk.com along with other games).
</P>
<P>
   As with Jack, up to three people can play at a time, mostly
answering multiple-choice questions centered around certain
Disney-related themes.
</P>
<P>
   The D Show uses graphics well, especially in a drop-dead opening
video sequence and in such bonus-round play as quickly matching
early and final renditions of famous animated characters.
</P>
<P>
   The game has a fun, '50s Formica-era look to it and good use of
audio. Overall, I'll give a thumbs-up for a brisk, well-crafted
title that Disney-minded people and their families will enjoy. This
should be the No. 1 seller in Burbank, Anaheim and Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   VIGILANTE 8: This Playstation game is a hoot, a yee-ha cross
between Demolition Derby and ``Mad Max,'' set in a post-Apocalyptic
American West with lots of ways to play against the computer or a
friend. You can blast things, run into them, jump or fly over them
and just generally have a great time. It's the Playstation port of,
by all accounts, the PC game, Interstate 76. Very fun.
</P>
<P>
   CRASH BANDICOOT 2: This Playstation game has been out for a bit
but has proven durably entertaining, even for younger kids. It's
done so well that its maker is trying to jam out Crash 3 in time
for this Christmas. May that effort have the same clever design,
challenging levels and silly touches.
</P>
<P>
   QUEST 64: This Nintendo 64 role-playing game is very well done,
with terrific graphics, lots of goofy enemies such as the Were Hare
and a good story line. It's been a big hit on the N64 for a reason.
</P>
<P>
   BOMBERMAN HERO: The latest Bomberman game, again on the N64, is
loads of fun, with great graphics, dozens of levels and plenty of
puzzles and mazes to challenge you.

SHE'S COME A LONG WAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; When the industry first decided to congratulate
itself with a golden trophy, the trinket had no clout.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly anyone even knew what an Emmy was, let alone why they
should care.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years later, the Emmy has become one of the most
influential characters in Hollywood, going from nonfactor to icon.
</P>
<P>
   And the viewing audience is finally sitting up, or reclining on
an easy chair, and watching.
</P>
<P>
   As TV's talent honors its own tonight at the ``50th Annual
Prime-time Emmy Awards'' (7 p.m., KNBC, Channel 4), the industry
will look back at a half-century of changes.
</P>
<P>
   Where we once had three channels, we now have an average of more
than 50 per household. The tightrope of all-live programming has
evolved into mostly taped, slickly edited fare. And a business that
struggled to find investors is now a multi-billion-dollar
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   And with time, the Emmy has established itself as a guidepost
for quality _ not only within the industry but also with the fickle
viewing audience.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always that way.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid- to late '70s, Nielsen ratings prove that viewers
favored escapist shows such as ``Happy Days,'' ``Laverne &AMP;
Shirley,'' ``Three's Company'' and ``Mork &AMP; Mindy,'' while
weightier shows such as ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show,'' ``All in the
Family'' and ``Taxi'' were named Outstanding Comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a complete disjunction between ratings and Emmys at
that time,'' said Robert Thompson, director of the study of popular
television at Syracuse University's Newhouse School of Journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the viewing audience wasn't convinced that the voting
members of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences knew what
the rest of America considered good entertainment. Maybe they
didn't care. Witness that Jackie Gleason, a comedy legend, never
won an Emmy. Jack Paar, David Janssen and John Goodman never were
recognized for their exceptional contributions to the medium.
Quality shows like ``Roseanne,'' ``Family,'' ``St. Elsewhere,''
``Twin Peaks'' and ``The Twilight Zone'' all have been passed over
by the golden girl.
</P>
<P>
   It's the nomination process that keeps a lot of deserving people
and products from getting that special nod, said Thomas O'Neil,
author of ``The Emmys'' ($19.95; Perigree Books).
</P>
<P>
   Of the shows that do clear the nomination hurdle, the best of
the lot usually wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main problem is the nomination stage,'' O'Neil said.
``Lower-rated shows don't get noticed. Blue-collar shows don't get
noticed. Shows like `The Drew Carey Show' or `Everybody Loves
Raymond,' the Beverly Hills set just doesn't understand those
shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Once past the nomination stage, however, the voting process
often takes away biases. Unlike the Oscars, which are voted on by
the entire motion picture academy, the final Emmy voting is done by
peer panels (directors for directors, actors for actors, and so
forth) ranging from six to 75 members. And, generally, voting is
done simultaneously at a swank hotel.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil attributes the tendency for votes to swing toward more
sentimental fare _ ``Frasier,'' for example, has consistently beat
out ``Seinfeld'' _ to the fact that women are more likely than men
to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men are too busy playing golf in Hollywood to sit on a panel
in a hotel room,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was the increasing prominence and pageantry of the Emmy
awards show. Maybe viewers were just looking for some guidance in
the ever-growing field of television program choices. Whatever the
reason, by the mid-'80s, Emmy's influence had gained ground.
</P>
<P>
   The big gap between what the industry thought was grade-A
material and what the audience wanted to spend its night watching
was starting to close.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Hill Street Blues'' debuted, it gained a great deal of
critical acclaim but had abysmal ratings, Thompson said. Three
years later, ``L.A. Law'' hit the scene, won a bunch of Emmys and
was a modest hit. ``ER'' followed in 1994 and not only won a lot of
Emmys but is one of the most popular shows of all time.
</P>
<P>
   ``From 1981 to 1997,'' he said, ``we have been on this march, a
slow but sure move to quality. The Emmy, combined with good
demographics, saved `Hill Street' long enough for audiences to find
it. That led to a birth of an entire renaissance of American
television _ a renaissance that the Emmy Awards played a
significant part in.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past 20 years, winning the coveted trophy has even been
credited with extending the lives of memorable series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that losing an Emmy award has ever killed a
show, but I think winning one usually has a minor, and sometimes, a
significant effect,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Shows such as ``Cheers,'' ``Hill Street Blues,'' ``Cagney &AMP;
Lacey,'' and ``Picket Fences'' have held off cancellation with the
help of an Emmy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The audience has become more sophisticated,'' said Meryl
Marshall, president of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.
``People do have the tendency to stay with what is familiar or
comfortable. An Emmy at least makes the audience take a second
look.''

THE SPLASH HEARD ROUND THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., Sept. 13)  
(JT) 
 By AMY M. SPINDLER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   This decade has produced the most powerful visual stimulation in
history. A Japanese cartoon has sent children into seizures.
Violence in movies can be so relentless that it inspires real-life
copycats. And computer games can be so enticing that people lose
themselves in them for days.
</P>
<P>
   But you wouldn't know all that from looking at most American
fashion magazines. Photographs are published like the tree that
falls in the forest when no one is there: they are soundless. They
cause no ripples. There are no aftershocks.
</P>
<P>
   The photography of Italian Vogue and L'Uomo Vogue crashes. It
might not cause seizures, but it inspires copycats regularly. The
magazine's editorial director, Franca Sozzani, 48, makes mere
fashion images seem like social commentary, and art _ insightful
and incite-ful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hers is a much more industry-driven, avant-garde magazine,''
Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue in America, said. ``We're
avant-garde up to a point, but ours is a magazine really driven by
the reader.''
</P>
<P>
   Italian Vogue talks less to the average reader than to designers
themselves. ``All the designers are saying to me, `I have to see
what Franca says,''' Ms. Wintour said. ``They really listen to her,
and she values it and doesn't abuse it. They really take her
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The disenfranchised, icy images based on the work of Alex Katz
in the recent Calvin Klein advertising campaign sprang from
photographs Steven Meisel first produced for Italian Vogue in the
July 1997 issue. After Ms. Sozzani published Peter Lindbergh's
photographs of supermodels made up like Sicilian men in February
1991, Dolce &AMP; Gabbana styled an entire runway show that way. The
much-discussed Calvin Klein jeans campaign in 1995 that was
criticized as inspired by child pornography sprang from photography
Meisel had done months earlier for L'Uomo Vogue. Viewers who were
upset by the Calvin Klein images were set off, no doubt, because
they were used to sell a product and appeared in the mass media.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sozzani gets away with the same provocative imagery because
she leaves readers with the impression, when they look at her
magazine, that she is not selling anything. It looks so arty that
no one guesses there might be a commercial motivation underneath.
``She's the most inspiring fashion journalist in the world at the
moment,'' Donatella Versace said. ``She's fearless. She doesn't
follow commercial reasons; she just follows intuition.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's always looking for new talent. She's the one who
discovered Steven Meisel and put him in Vogue. She thinks of
fashion as a kind of art you can see in the magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sozzani didn't discover only Meisel, who had three pictures
in a book when she met him in New York in 1979 and is now the most
influential image maker in his field. During the same trip to
Manhattan, after she had been named editor of Italian Glamour at
age 28, she also found Bruce Weber, Herb Ritts and Lindbergh, who
were starting their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met that bunch of photographers at the same time, and
they're still the most important photographers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sozzani is in New York this week for an exhibition that
celebrates 30 years of the Italian men's magazine L'Uomo Vogue,
which she oversees along with Italian Vogue. For the last 10 years,
she has been making both magazines less fashion publications than
galleries for the art of fashion's best photographers. The theme of
this month's issue for the magazine's 30th anniversary is how
influential fashion photographers like Weber, Craig McDean, David
Sims and Paolo Roversi see men. The men certainly are dressed in
designer fashion largely chosen from the collections of
advertisers, as is often the case in fashion magazines. But that
isn't the point of the photographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's good is once I finish telling photographers the idea I
see, I let them be free to go on,'' Ms. Sozzani said. ``It's like
hiring an artist and saying, `Make a painting 2 meters by 2 meters
by 2 meters.' You can't if you want the best they can give you.
They know they're free with me. There is a really good relationship
with me because we really trust each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, at Lehmann Maupin at 39 Greene Street in SoHo,
will display the L'Uomo Vogue photographs until Sept. 20. ``Franca
really understands the creative mind, and she deals with the
commercial photographers the way a galleryist deals with an
artist,'' David Maupin, an owner of the gallery, said. ``I see the
way she constructs her magazines each month. There are parallels
with the way a gallery creates a group show or a curator puts
together a group show.''
</P>
<P>
   When she was hired by Italian Vogue in 1988, she took her
``group show'' with her. And they have gone on to do some of their
best work for Italian Vogue. Weber has produced some of the most
charming, charismatic fashion photography ever made. And Meisel has
created some of the most haunting and resonant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Photographers, whether they're taking pictures of fashion or
war, want their own voice to come through in the images that
magazines publish,'' Ingrid Sischy, the editor of Interview
magazine, said. ``Franca Sozzani is one of those editors who gets
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The first time Weber worked with Ms. Sozzani, he recalled, he
made typical fashion-shoot small talk, asking the editor what she
planned to do when their work, in Florida, was over. ``She said to
me, `I'm going to hitchhike across America,''' Weber said. ``And I
thought, that's a person who's pretty interested in things.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sozzani works like a reporter, drawing out a photographer's
passions, Weber said. ``She talks about what you've been doing, if
you've been to the theater, the ballet, museum, met someone you
liked a lot that you'd like to get to know better by photographing
them,'' he continued. ``I always thought that was a great place to
get started when you're talking about pictures.'' He recently
traveled to North Carolina because he had always loved Carl
Sandburg; he ended up photographing in Sandburg's former home for
Italian Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to Franca's success is the freedom that she gives the
people who work for her,'' Tom Ford, the designer for Gucci, said.
``She hires the best people and gives them an enormous amount of
freedom. Which isn't to say she doesn't guide or direct them, but
she lets them do their jobs. It's probably one of the freest
magazines in the world. She also has a great eye for assembling a
great cast of people.''

IT ALL BEGAN WITH ONE WOMAN AND A PUPPET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Shirley Dinsdale didn't want to go to a
television industry banquet on Jan. 25, 1949.
</P>
<P>
   She had a hot date and no desire to go to something called the
Emmy Awards at the Hollywood Athletic Club, sit at a folding lawn
table and waste a Tuesday night. Dinsdale and her sidekick, puppet
Judy Splinters, were done for another day and about to take off
when her bosses at KTLA told her she had to go to an evening event
to represent the station.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what it was,'' she said via telephone from her
Long Island home, ``and they wouldn't tell me why I had to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason for their insistence became apparent shortly after.
Dinsdale and Splinters were the recipients of the first Emmy Award
ever to be handed out _ for Most Outstanding Personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judy accepted with me,'' Dinsdale said. ``She complained that
she didn't get the Emmy and I did. I didn't know that night, but I
realized quite quickly that it was a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   If Dinsdale hadn't shown up to accept the first trophy, who
knows if they ever would have gotten to the second?
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years later, the trophy of a winged woman holding a globe
remains the same (``Mine is an old lady now''), but the awards
ceremony has grown. At the outset, the awards were regional; 600
people attended the event at a cost of $5 a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Television was a fledgling industry. There was no national or
taped programming, not many television sets and not much money
being invested. Emmy results were buried on Page 6 of Variety.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very different then,'' Dinsdale said. ``It's hard to
explain to people. It was a very innocent time.''
</P>
<P>
   Dinsdale and Splinters' show-biz careers started on a radio
station in San Francisco when Dinsdale was 14. With Judy, who was
designed by her artist father, and ventriloquy lessons that came in
a barter deal with one of her father's clients, Dinsdale would go
far.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1942, she and her mother took a trip to Los Angeles and
never returned to the Bay Area. She signed with William Morris
shortly after, moved her act to Eddie Canter's radio show, did a
lot of war work for the Hollywood Victory Committee, and then KTLA
called.
</P>
<P>
   At first she appeared on a five-minute daily spot to wish a
viewer happy birthday (think of her as an early Willard Scott).
</P>
<P>
   As television expanded, so did Dinsdale's exposure. She traveled
to New York and Chicago to appear on local telecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1953, after a six-year television career, Dinsdale got
married and left broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to a turning point in my life,'' she said. ``I went on
to do other things. TV wasn't the only thing in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Dinsdale entered Stony Brook University on New York's Long
Island at age 40 and found another new field to go into _
respiratory therapy and cardiopulmonary therapy specializing in
bypass surgery and transplants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both careers were new careers,'' said Dinsdale. ``Because of
that, they were both exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Dinsdale, 71, who has two children and two grandchildren (who
sometimes get to see Judy Splinters leave the shelf to entertain
them), will not be able to come to this year's Emmys.
</P>
<P>
   Suffering from three forms of cancer, she is on chemotherapy and
unable to travel. But then, Dinsdale is used to overcoming
hardships. She spent a year in the hospital as a child after being
badly burned when a croup kettle tipped over. What finally brought
her out of her shell? A puppet named Judy Splinters. And the rest
is history.

 UNDATED: of people.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the years, photography from Italian Vogue has presaged the
renewed interest in 1996 in the esthetics of the Bauhaus, like
Prada's clashing prints, the trailer trash esthetic that emerged
with Courtney Love in 1995 and, to Ms. Sozzani's personal distress,
the revival of the mod 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the '80s, fashion became really old,'' she said.
``We wanted to give a message of being glamorous and happy. And we
said the most glamorous and happy time was the '60s. In October,
when I went to see the shows, everything was the '60s, and I said,
what did I do? Because on the runway it looked awful. We did a big
mistake. But at the same time, I realized how much Vogue was a
reference for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   When she took over the magazines, she inherited a business run
by the decree of the advertising staff. It was at the height of the
most vulgar '80s excesses, and Ms. Sozzani couldn't find clothes
that met her stringent esthetic criteria. So she had a woman
photographed in a white shirt and blue jeans for the July/August
1988 cover. ``We shot a lot of white shirts in those days,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Milanese fashion powers were not content. ``We almost lost
all the advertising clients,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   They became less content when, for her first couture issue, she
put Yves Saint Laurent on the cover. It provoked a gentlemanly
rebuke from the head of Valentino, Giancarlo Giametti, who had got
used to seeing his outfits on the cover of that particular couture
issue under previous editors. Ms. Sozzani recalled: `` `The first
couture issue,' Giametti said, `that's my cover.' Everybody was a
little bit scared because they were use to having 10 pages each
issue. Not just the big designers, but everyone. The smallest
clients, as soon as they'd advertise, they'd get their Vogue
editorial pages.''
</P>
<P>
   What developed instead was an unusual relationship where
designers started looking to Ms. Sozzani for direction, including
asking her advice on how to shape their ad campaigns. It gave
Italian Vogue a power that few fashion magazines attain, and some
would see as a conflict of interest. Italian Vogue wasn't trying to
inspire a woman in a department store; it was trying to inspire the
designers who dressed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Italian and L'Uomo Vogue have always been something of trade
publications, like W is now,'' said Stefano Tonchi, who worked with
Ms. Sozzani at L'Uomo Vogue and is the creative fashion director of
Esquire. In other words, the magazines are perused with fervor by
insiders to the fashion trade, who are not only educated in fashion
but also indoctrinated. ``Which is why W can be more provocative
and interesting and on the edge than American Vogue or Harper's
Bazaar,'' Tonchi said.
</P>
<P>
   What Ms. Sozzani did was stop linking her coverage to the
collections in the instructive way most American magazines do.
Instead, she politely invited designers to follow her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it works, sometimes not,'' she said. ``Sometimes
we're too early and we have to go back.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressures to produce a fat magazine with lots of advertising
and million-mark circulation has put a heavy burden on the
creativity at American magazines. The cover that sells best at the
newsstand isn't necessarily the most creative one; market tests
dictate what the choice should be. Editorial spreads with the most
progressive ideas aren't necessarily the ones readers like best;
researchers test-market the layouts and even individual photo.
</P>
<P>
   An odd thing has happened in America as marketing has intruded
into fashion photography. Advertising has become more creative than
many magazines' editorial spreads. And many of those advertisers
have been getting their ideas from European magazines like Italian
Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only 10 years ago, the editorial was more interesting than
advertisement,'' Ms. Sozzani said. ``Today the advertisement is
more interesting than editorial, because designers are creative
people and they want to go on. They want to try. They want to be
different. Sometimes it's not good that the magazines want to be
all the same. They're scared to be different one from the other
one. The designers can't be the same. They're trying to find their
own way. And when you're trying to find your own way there is risk,
and risk is good.''
</P>
<P>
   Italian Vogue's circulation is 130,000. By contrast, American
Vogue's is 1.1 million. In America, Italian Vogue sells 10,000
copies at the newsstand and 10,000 by subscription. ``It's pretty
incredible when you think that it's not even translated,'' its
editor said.
</P>
<P>
   Against those who would argue for the more accessible images of
American magazines, with models sipping coffee or buying groceries
in $3,000 dresses, Ms. Sozzani argues that it isn't fair to
readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman has to spend so much money to buy a designer dress,
you have to give her a dream,'' she said. ``If you're going to give
her constantly reality, the clothes should be much less
expensive.''

WHO'S THE EMMY HOST?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; If you can guess who will be the host of
tonight's Emmy telecast, I'll give you $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   OK, make it $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Make it as many million as you want, because you won't get it.
There is no host for the four-hour broadcast (7 p.m. on KNBC
Channel 4). The free-wheeling format will lend itself to a
comprehensive broadcast to celebrate television and hand out 27
awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can tell you is that conceptually we felt like a no-host
format was best,'' said Don Mischer, executive producer of the Emmy
telecast. ``I like the flexibility of being able to start the show
with a total surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   The Emmys have not only moved from the Pasadena Civic Auditorium
to the Shrine Auditorium, the start time was moved an hour earlier,
leading to the longest show in Emmy history.
</P>
<P>
   But this being the 50th installment of television's biggest
award presentation, there will be plenty of retrospective pieces to
fill the time.
</P>
<P>
   One highlight of the show will be a countdown of the top 10
moments in television history. There will be a tribute to past and
present stars and a look at the first half-century of television.
</P>
<P>
   The show will air live on the East Coast and on a three-hour
delay on the West Coast. Unlike the Oscars, this show will end on
time.

BIG PREDICTIONS FOR SMALL SCREEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Put away the crystal ball. Hang up on your
personal astrologer. Even alien intelligence won't help get inside
the heads of Emmy voters (sorry, Scully and Mulder), whose voting
patterns are as predictable as the winning lottery numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Critics everywhere try every year, but the Emmy, she's got a
mind of her own.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, who could have imagined that last year would be
the one when long-overdue ``Law &AMP; Order'' would be tapped as top
drama?
</P>
<P>
   Who would guess that ``Frasier'' would win in each of its first
four years as top comedy or that ``The Larry Sanders Show'' would
be all but snubbed?
</P>
<P>
   Playing the ``Who will win?'' game is nothing more than a
multiple-choice exam you didn't _ no, couldn't _ study for.
</P>
<P>
   But who !ital!should win is another story. If the karma is
right, the stars aligned in perfect order, the ``should wins'' and
the ``did wins'' may even collide at the winner's podium. Stranger
things have happened. Hey, ``Who's the Boss?'' was on TV for eight
years, wasn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at the big six categories and who should go home
happy: &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
OUTSTANDING &UR;  &LR; ACTOR IN A COMEDY &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Kelsey Grammer, ``Frasier'': Two balding men in battle for a
trophy. This one comes down to between two-time winner Grammer and
John Lithgow (``3rd Rock From the Sun''), who has won the past two
years. Face it, Lithgow may be a great actor, but we have seen all
that he can do with his Dick Solomon character. Grammer, however,
goes toe-to-toe with better actors each week and more than holds
his own. Long-shot pick: Michael J. Fox (``Spin City''). &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
OUTSTANDING ACTRESS IN A COMEDY &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Calista Flockhart, ``Ally McBeal'': Helen Hunt (``Mad About
You'') should stick to the Oscars. Hunt, winner in this category
the past two years and winner of Best Actress at March's Oscars
(``As Good as It Gets''), will be beaten by Flockhart, who shows a
tremendous amount of range playing the most interesting character
of the television season. Long-shot pick: Jenna Elfman (``Dharma &AMP;
Greg''). &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
OUTSTANDING ACTRESS IN A DRAMA &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Christine Lahti, ``Chicago Hope'': Sure, Gillian Anderson (``The
X-Files'') had a great season, battling mysterious cancer, to
follow her Emmy-winning year. But it's about time that Lahti, the
female tour de force of ``Hope'' be recognized for her consistently
outstanding work. Long shot: Jane Seymour (``Dr. Quinn: Medicine
Woman''). &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
OUTSTANDING ACTOR IN A DRAMA &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Andre Braugher, ``Homicide: Life on the Street'': Maybe there
will finally be justice for this Baltimore police officer. Arguably
the best actor on television for nearly five years, Braugher has
been ignored by Emmy voters. This is their last chance to correct
their mistake, as Braugher has left the series. It would not be a
mistake to give this award to Dennis Franz (``NYPD Blue'') for the
fourth time in five years, either. Long shot: David Duchovny (``The
X-Files''). &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
OUTSTANDING COMEDY SERIES &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Larry Sanders Show'': You can take your ``Frasier'' and
its record-tying four consecutive Emmy wins and give it a fifth. Go
ahead _ be boring and predictable. But, it would be better to try
something new. ``Sanders'' has not just been the best comedy on
television since it debuted, it has been the best program on
television. All it has to show for all that good work is one
Outstanding Supporting Actor win for Rip Torn. This show is so
overdue for the win that, if it were a library book, the charges
would equal the gross national product of a Third World country.
Long shot: ``Seinfeld.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
OUTSTANDING DRAMA SERIES &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Practice'': We need one category that will have a surprise
winner, don't we? And this is always an interesting category. Last
year, ``Law &AMP; Order'' was a surprising yet deserving winner. Same
goes for ``Picket Fences'' in 1993 and 1994. ``The Practice''
tackles extremely tough cases and issues, and does so with heart
and intelligence. If not ``The Practice,'' look for ``The X-Files''
to take the prize in its season-leading-up-to-a-movie campaign.
Long shot: ``Law &AMP; Order.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Picking at a plate of fried chicken nuggets, Jackie O'Brien and
her daughter, Shelby, 8, were busy discussing the notion of beauty
at a Denny's in Timonium, Md., on the Saturday of Labor Day
weekend. Mrs. O'Brien looked like a down-to-earth suburban mom:
shoulder-length red hair, a little makeup, a T-shirt and pants.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Shelby wore her auburn hair in an elaborately
curled and sprayed ponytail on the side of her head. She wore the
clothes of an 8-year-old _ a baseball jersey over jean shorts _ but
her face was done up like an overenthusiastic 20-year-old: her
cheeks were matte with beige foundation, her eyelashes stiff with
black mascara and her lips, expertly traced with lip liner,
sparkled with a cherry-red gloss. The effect was doll-like and
eerily mesmerizing.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. O'Brien pointed out that this visit to Timonium _ the
weekend of the Charming Miss and Master National Beauty Pageant,
held in the ballroom of the Timonium Days Inn _ marked Shelby's
first national beauty pageant.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, a child venturing to a national pageant for
the first time might have conjured up simple images of pride and
uncomplicated wholesomeness, images like those suggested by a trip
to a national spelling bee or Little League World Series. With
their fanciful names _ like Our Diamond Miss, Tropical Kids USA,
Dream Girls, the New England Star/Sweetheart Pageant, America's
Touch of Class, Glamour Dolls, Universal Southern Charm _ the
pageants sound like lighthearted, even campy fun.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing has been lighthearted about the world of children's
pageants in the 20 months since the death of JonBenet Ramsey. Kacey
Sales, 9, a contestant who has been entering pageants since she was
6 months old and considers herself an old hand, shared the table
with Shelby and her mother. She spoke about how the pageants have
changed since December 1996, when JonBenet, the 6-year-old beauty
queen from Boulder, Colo., was found strangled in her parents'
basement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember a lot of reporters coming up to talk to me,'' Kacey
said, referring to her post-JonBenet pageant appearances. ``They
tried to get me to say that my mom made me go to beauty pageants.
They put me on TV, and they got a psychologist to say stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. O'Brien rushed to change the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we remember where beauty is,'' Mrs. O'Brien said, looking
at her daughter. ``Where's beauty at, Shelby?''
</P>
<P>
   Shelby rolled her deep brown eyes and delivered what sounded
like a well-rehearsed answer. ``Inside, Mom. Inside,'' she said,
and put a handful of french fries into her mouth sideways before
adding, ``Can I go change now?''
</P>
<P>
   Since JonBenet died, and endless photographs of her carefully
made-up face and coquettish pageant dance routines became mawkish
fodder for tabloids, the children's beauty pageant circuit has
watched the number of contests plummet.
</P>
<P>
   After her death, JonBenet became for many Americans a poignant
symbol of parental manipulation and child exploitation. The media
tempest that followed her death, especially the tabloid television
coverage, propagated a stereotype of dangerous role models for
children and perpetuated an image of the jealous, preening stage
mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like her being a beauty queen was the reason for her
death,'' said one Maryland mother, whose 3-year-old daughter
entered the Charming Miss pageant. ``At least that's how the press
made the whole thing out to be.'' This pageant mother spoke on the
condition that she not be named, explaining that her wariness
stemmed from what she viewed as the media's negative coverage of
children's pageants.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the girls on the pageant circuit speak candidly
about JonBenet, referring to her by her first name as if she had
once been a friend, most of their parents merely refer to her death
and the subsequent coverage as ``the incident'' or ``the scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, pageant organizers and parents, who once eagerly sought
publicity, are so press-shy they ask that their names _ and their
children's pictures _ not be published. Some parents even tell
reporters that they want to approve their quotations before
publication, something that most major newspapers, including this
one, do not do. Corporate sponsors have vanished, with few
exceptions. Pageant World and Pageant Life, the two magazine bibles
of the children's pageant circuit, have folded since JonBenet's
death; their former editors have unlisted phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing you can write about us, good or bad, that will
bring any good attention to the industry,'' said Patsy McCutcheon,
the editor of Patsy's Pageant magazine, one of the few remaining
chronicles of the children's pageant circuit. The magazine
circulates to a few thousand readers, pageant organizers say,
although Ms. McCutcheon would not discuss circulation figures.
``We've never really recovered from JonBenet,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In January 1997, shortly after JonBenet's death, the editor of
Pageant World magazine was quoted as saying that the children's
pageant business was a $1-billion-a-year industry. That empire
embraced 3,000 beauty pageants in the United States, with 100,000
contestants under age 14, Ted Cohen of World Pageants Inc. said at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That seems awfully high to me right now,'' said Carl Dunn, the
national marketing director for Pageantry Magazine. ``As with any
business, you have peaks and valleys,'' he said. ``And '97 was a
valley.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dunn could not offer concrete figures. ``Your guess is as
good as mine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mari Muller, the publisher of the Pageant Information Gathering
Service in Oneonta, N.Y., a newsletter with a circulation of 500
that publishes a schedule of pageants across the country, said, ``I
don't think you'd find 3,000 pageants in the U.S. right now.''
There are 50 to 100 major pageants in the United States, and about
1,000 altogether, a steep decline from the period before JonBenet's
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``JonBenet's situation, which was a very sad situation, did
tremendous damage to the industry,'' Mrs. Muller said.
</P>
<P>
   As the grand jury that will hear evidence in the Ramsey case
prepares for its first meeting later this month, the children's
beauty pageant circuit shows few signs of bouncing back.
</P>
<P>
   One pageant director, Cindy Doane, the director of the Sweet Pea
Pageant in Cocoa Beach, Fla., said her contestants numbered only 69
this year, compared with the pre-JonBenet figure of 135 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Since JonBenet's death, entry fees are up, as organizers
struggle to meet costs. Some mothers say that in contests where
entry fees used to be $50, they are now $200, and those that were
once $200 are now $500. And a result, pageant parents say, is that
some contestants have been winnowed out, leaving a scrappy group of
competitors with deep pockets and nerves of steel.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a mother who will spend $2,000 on an evening
dress for her 6-year-old,'' Mrs. O'Brien said last weekend at
Denny's, ``that's really out of control. Shelby and I don't do
that, but we've definitely seen it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although that may be an extreme example, even average expenses
add up quickly: an evening dress and a sportswear outfit for the
pageant, travel and registration expenses, photography and makeup.
Parents at the Charming Miss pageant calculated that a weekend
visit might well cost $3,000, and in some cases more.
</P>
<P>
   Those who flock to the pageants say they attend because the
events build their children's self-esteem; it's not about looks.
</P>
<P>
   At the Charming Miss pageant in Timonium last weekend, spirits
were jovial. Cindy Harrison, the director of Charming Miss, began
advertising her pageant on the World Wide Web last year and
attracted 42 contestants this year, up from just 14 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pageants are more about personality now,'' said Shirley
Niblett, whose daughter was a Charming Miss contestant. ``I think
you had a phase-down for a while, and then everyone sort of relaxed
their standards a bit. Less makeup, maybe fewer sequins.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Price, whose daughter, Kelly, wore a poodle skirt and
pretended to daub powder on her nose from a compact during the
``Fifties Wear'' competition, said: ``Let's get real. This is kids
getting dressed up in costume.''
</P>
<P>
   But some mothers at Charming Miss were tense. Jo-Anne Bernier
D'Amboise, a professional pageant consultant, asked a news
photographer not to take pictures of her daughter, who wore a red
pillbox hat and red polka-dot dress.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bernier D'Amboise, who advertises her services on the World
Wide Web, illustrated with photographs of her and those of little
girls she has trained, said that ``the press will not promote these
pageants in a positive way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bernier D'Amboise's 10-year-old daughter, who has her own
page on her mother's Web site, sat rigidly beside her and didn't
crack a smile until she got up on stage for the ``Fifties Wear''
competition a half-hour later.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Hitt's 11-year-old daughter, Jamie, who was carrying the
tiara she won earlier this year at the Sunshine International
beauty pageant in Florida, came to Charming Miss to watch some of
her friends from the pageant circuit. Asked by a reporter what she
wanted to do with her life, she said, ``Well, of course, I want to
be Miss Universe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't want to be Miss America,'' her mother said. Jamie
explained why: ``Because when you're Miss America, you have to deal
with the press all the time, When Heather Whitestone won, she was
taken away, and she was surrounded by media, and she had to travel
all the time, and she never saw her parents again. And that's why I
want to be Miss Universe, so I'm above all of that.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At the moment of President Clinton's deepest peril
in office, Al Gore was where he has always been these last six
years. By the president's side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've stood with him as he has led this nation, and on a
personal note, I would like to tell you he is not only a great
president, he has been a great friend,'' the vice president said on
Friday morning, introducing Clinton at the White House annual
prayer breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Gore appeared again with the president at a
memorial service for victims of the bombings last month at American
embassies in Africa and at a White House ceremony to honor
Americans who played a role in the peace accord between Ireland and
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   And after Congress made public the 445-page report that argues
an independent counsel's case for impeachment of Clinton, based on
his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, aides to Gore said they
could not imagine the vice president taking even one step back from
his boss even with the gravity of the day and the seriousness of
the charges.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore did not issue any immediate public response to the
report, Lawrence Haas, his communications director, said: ``Recent
controversies have had no effect on the vice president's day-to-day
business activities or behavior. He continues to do the same thing
he's done for the last six years, serve the country by helping the
president implement the policies that have done so much to move
this country forward. He will continue to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the scandal that has riveted the nation for more than
seven months, Clinton has had no stauncher ally than Gore, a
certain presidential contender in 2000 whose Boy Scout image has
provided the administration a vital means to convey policy
initiatives at a time when many voters are distracted by the
president's personal life, often at the expense of his political
message.
</P>
<P>
   Consistently describing Clinton as ``my friend,'' even through
the frenzy of the report's release, Gore has steadily pounded away
at rallies and town-hall style meetings, imploring Democrats of
their need, more than ever, to organize and vote. While he never
mentions the president's problems _ and did not Friday _ often
implicit in his message is the expectation that Republicans will
use the Lewinsky matter to galvanize their support at the state and
local levels to get out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks on Thursday to the Democratic Business Council, a
group of party donors, he hailed Clinton as his friend and ``the
one person who stands at the heart'' of the country's economic
gains. He closed with what has become his standard conclusion:
``Early to bed, early to rise, work like hell and organize.''
</P>
<P>
   The mix of unvarnished loyalty to a wounded president and strong
support for his policies is helping make Gore a valuable campaigner
for Democratic party ideals and candidates. Not even his role in
campaign fund-raising, which is under investigation by the Justice
Department for possible illegalities, has doused eagerness of
Democratic candidates around the country to have him appear with
them _ even as some, like Maryland Governor Parris Glendening, have
snubbed Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   With elections two months away and the chances for Democratic
gains in the House and Senate diminishing, aides to Gore say he is
in growing demand, especially by House members locked in tight
races. They say he had always intended to spend two or three days a
week on the road campaigning but fallout from the report could
prompt him to increase that.
</P>
<P>
   The next of these campaign trips begins on Saturday, when Gore
leaves for Oregon and Washington state before before joining
Clinton next week at a Democratic party rally in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Between campaign trips, aides say, Gore has been calling
Democratic candidates and party officials across the country,
urging them to support the president's policies and to whip up
voter enthusiasm _ irrespective of their views of Clinton's
personal behavior. Through the elections, they said, that strategy
was not likely to change.

   Companies spearheading agriculture's gene technology revolution
are not only up against consumer opposition to engineered crops.
They have also started fighting amongst themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto, the American biotechnology giant that has invested
millions of dollars in soya crops genetically engineered to resist
the herbicide glyphosate, which it sells as Roundup, could find its
profits slashed now that British rival Zeneca has found that the
plants are also resistant to its own herbicide, Touchdown. The two
companies are locked in a bitter legal battle in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto's soya beans are genetically altered to tolerate
Roundup, allowing the herbicide to kill weeds without harming the
crop. Monsanto aimed to profit by selling farmers both beans and
herbicide.
</P>
<P>
   Glyphosate is the only herbicide approved by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency for use with the modified soya, and
farmers who grow the plants sign an agreement only to use Roundup.
But Zeneca is seeking approval from the EPA to use its own
pesticide, sulfosate, marketed as Touchdown, on the engineered
soya. Zeneca says its tests show that the plants are also resistant
to sulfosate.
</P>
<P>
   When it heard about the application, Monsanto started legal
proceedings against Zeneca and Pioneer Hi-Bred of Des Moines, Iowa,
the company which sold the beans to Zeneca. Monsanto claims that
under the license agreement it signed with Pioneer, such tests were
prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zeneca did everything without going through the proper legal
channels,'' says Scarlett Foster, director of public affairs at
Monsanto's headquarters in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer and Zeneca replied last month with a suit claiming that
Monsanto's patent on the soya beans is invalid, and charging
Monsanto with engaging in unfair competition. ``We don't believe we
violated anyone's agreement,'' says Ed Ready, a spokesman for
Zeneca's U.S. arm in Wilmington, Del. &QL;

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: A case for censorship
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   To paraphrase someone whose name I never remember, there is no
human instinct stronger than the desire of one person to mess with
another's copy. So, every now and again people are seized with the
passion to scour entire libraries and throw out the dirty parts.
</P>
<P>
   The censorship crowd usually loses, since it has an unerring
instinct for quality, but don't think there is some filth, as
Winston Churchill said, up with which I will not put. My nomination
is Kenneth Starr's official report on the Lewinksy affair. I have
not read the Starr report, nor do I intend to, which qualifies most
censors. I have tons of lame-brained opinions. That should clinch
it.
</P>
<P>
   The Starr report contains more sinning than the Bible. My
demands are, of course, the grossly hypocritical prejudae of old
age. My youth was spent in ceaseless search of dirty books. Every
kid my age believed our little local library had a copy of a
terrific book called ``God's Little Acre'' locked in a secret room
closed but to qualified scholars. A registered nurse was there to
aid readers driven mad or to some disgusting excess. Her
granddaughter now performs the same function.
</P>
<P>
   In my teens, I bought a copy of ``The Second Lady Chatterley''
at a bus station. Imagine my despair when the book turned out to be
``Lady Chatterley's Lover'' with the John Henry stuff out. Left
behind was about Natural Man and the British class system. If you
want boring, read that.

   A technique developed by chemists in California generates 3-D
images that can be used to track a gene's activity through the
stages of a growing embryo.
</P>
<P>
   Compounds of metal ions such as gadolinium can increase the
brightness of the magnetic resonance imaging signal produced by
neighboring water molecules. Such ``contrast agents'' light up
wherever water is present.
</P>
<P>
   But now Thomas Meade and his colleagues at the California
Institute of Technology in Pasadena have made ``smart'' contrast
agents, which cause strong signals only when a particular gene has
been activated.
</P>
<P>
   To do this they designed a molecule that holds gadolinium in a
cage, denying water molecules access to the metal and so turning
off the MRI signal. The cage can be designed so that when a
particular enzyme is present, it clips off the cage's roof,
allowing water in and turning the signal on.
</P>
<P>
   Meade and his team tested their idea by introducing messenger
RNA for a bacterial enzyme into one cell of a four-cell embryo of
an African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis.
</P>
<P>
   When the embryo had divided to form 16 cells, the researchers
injected the caged contrast agent into some of the cells. Only the
glowing descendants of the original cells showed up on an MRI scan.
</P>
<P>
   Meade says his MRI contrast agent can be adjusted to respond to
different enzymes, so the technique could have clinical uses, such
as tracking the activity of protease produced by HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty exciting,'' says Bill Horrocks, a chemist at
Pennsylvania State University in University Park. ``He has a lot of
clever ideas about how to get these things to react with enzymes in
vivo.'' &QL;

 &HT;    EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 13
 &HT;    Clinton must muster the courage to resign
 &HT;    A Journal-Constitution joint editorial
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This joint editorial reflects the conclusions of the editorial
boards of both The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution,
acting independently.
</P>
<P>
   The American people have been doomed to a guided tour of hell,
exposed against their wishes to the details of a particularly seamy
presidential scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Only one person can spare us further heartache. By resigning,
President Clinton would be surrendering the office he worked his
entire life to achieve and would hand his enemies the victory they
have long sought. No one as proud and stubborn as the president
could take such a step easily.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, by making that sacrifice, Clinton would save the nation
from a protracted trauma that will otherwise further cripple the
presidency and Congress and further discredit a political system
already held in low esteem. A president more concerned with the
national interest than his own self-preservation would realize that
resignation is his only responsible option.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, Bill Clinton has shown himself incapable of such
sacrifice. He is a complex man with many attractive qualities, but
in the end his character has been defined by crass selfishness. It
is that trait _ perjury and adultery are merely its symptoms _ that
has rendered him unfit to continue as president.
</P>
<P>
   At repeated points in the progression of this scandal, Clinton
has faced a critical choice: ``Should I do what is best for the
country, or should I do what is best for me?'' If at any of those
points, Clinton had chosen to do what was best for the country, we
would not be in this mess. But he could not find that strength.
</P>
<P>
   Look how it began: In late 1995, the Paula Jones
sexual-harassment case was already hanging over Clinton's head, and
his political opponents had made it clear that they thirsted for
his blood. Yet, despite the danger to his presidency, Clinton
decided to begin a sexual relationship with a 21-year-old intern
named Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   That reckless decision _ to gamble his presidency on the ability
of a starry-eyed young woman to keep her silence _ has been
described as terrible judgment, and it is. But even more troubling,
it demonstrates that Clinton valued his own gratification too
highly and took his duty as president too lightly.
</P>
<P>
   That choice between his duty as president and his own
self-interest presented itself again when Clinton was asked, in a
sworn deposition in the Jones case, whether he had sexual relations
with Lewinsky. As a father and husband, his natural instinct was to
deny the charge and commit perjury. According to the polls, most
Americans do not judge Clinton harshly for that decision. They
accept his explanation that he was trying to protect himself and
his family.
</P>
<P>
   However, the act of committing perjury has consequences for the
president of the United States that do not apply when the crime is
committed by most husbands and fathers. The president takes an oath
before the entire nation to uphold the law; by committing a felony,
he violates that solemn oath.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the nature of his perjury, Clinton's decision to lie
will not by itself generate the public anger necessary for
impeachment. It is nonetheless important, because it satisfies the
constitutional requirement that impeachment involve ``high crimes
and misdemeanors.'' At some later date, it and other charges could
provide the technical foundation for impeachment motivated by
other, less legal considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's most cowardly and indefensible refusal to put the
national interest ahead of his own well-being involves his
protracted attempt to conceal his perjury and infidelity. Over the
past several months, he has enlisted the full force and majesty of
his office in defense of his deception, and in the process damaged
the presidency both as an institution and as a national symbol.
</P>
<P>
   For example, his forceful and falsely sincere denial of an
affair with ``that woman, Miss Lewinsky'' put his Cabinet members
in a tough position. They had to either publicly proclaim their
confidence in the president, or resign. He forced them to put their
personal and professional credibility on the line in defense of
what he knew to be a lie.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, because Clinton refused to tell the truth, Secret
Service agents were compelled to testify before a grand jury,
compromising what had been assumed to be a confidential
relationship between a president and the agents assigned to protect
him. And when White House aides were summoned to testify about what
they knew, government lawyers fought the subpoenas on a claim of
executive privilege. The courts overruled that claim, a decision
that will haunt future presidents who want to consult honestly with
staff on legally delicate matters.
</P>
<P>
   When he first looked the American people in the eye and denied
his infidelity, Clinton might not have envisioned the full impact
of his deception on other people. But as the consequences became
clear, and as he saw the toll his deception was taking on members
of his staff and Cabinet, he had the obligation to intervene, to
halt the weakening of the presidency by the simple act of telling
the truth.
</P>
<P>
   But to save his own hide, he remained silent.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on Aug. 17, unable any longer to maintain fiction as
fact, Clinton faced the nation. Here was his last chance to put the
interests of the nation above his own. By coming clean, by laying
the truth on the table for all to see, Clinton had the opportunity
to move the scandal to a quick resolution. And again, he failed.
Even then, he could not see beyond his own narrow needs; he could
not summon the courage to do what was right for the nation.
</P>
<P>
   With the filing of the Starr report, the process toward
impeachment has accelerated. Final judgment on the impeachment
question will remain premature, however, until President Clinton
has had a chance to respond. The forced removal of a president
through constitutional means is a grave matter that should not be
handled hastily.
</P>
<P>
   The case for resignation, on the other hand, is already clear.
At the moment, Clinton's selfishness still serves as a blindfold,
rendering him unable to see the seriousness of his situation. But
just as time eventually forced him to admit both his lies and his
infidelity, it may eventually force him to consider resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Democrats are already abandoning the nominal head
of their party. At some point in the near future, they may go to
him and ask him to remove his blindfold and look honestly at the
ugly spectacle that he has wrought.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe then he will find the courage to do what is best for
his country.

 &HT;    Reading UCLA defense biggest challenge for Longhorns QB
 &HT;    By Mark Wangrin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a radiologist it's all there in black and white.
</P>
<P>
   You read a formation, compare it with your body of knowledge,
detect a flaw and figure the best ways to treat it.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Walton's voice takes on a tone of awe when he talks
about how his uncle, Dallas radiologist Dr. Leber Beall, can see
something where others do not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at X-rays everything looks the same to me, but he can
find something a little different,'' Walton says. ``He's the most
laid-back guy, but when he goes to work he attacks it. He looks at
an X-ray like he's loving it, like you or I would look at a
football game.''
</P>
<P>
   Walton hopes to someday be a radiologist. He hopes to have that
same discerning eye. He hopes to find potential problems before
others.
</P>
<P>
   He'll get that chance on Saturday, as the University of Texas
starting quarterback when he'll start counting heads on the UCLA
side of the line, figuring out which one will be in his face this
time.
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect to halfback Ricky Williams, whose Heisman
candidacy undergoes its first of back-to-back tests, and to the UT
defense, which hopes to at least give UCLA quarterback Cade McNown
the semblance of a similar test, Walton might be the most important
figure in the Longhorns' chances of pulling off a stunning win.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike Williams and the defense, the best scenario is for
him to go unnoticed. No interceptions. No fumbles. No sacks. A .600
or better completion percentage.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Walton drew the start against UCLA when James Brown
injured his ankle late in an opening-night win over Rutgers. With a
full week of practice behind him, Walton was ready. ``I remember
feeling real good going into the game,'' he recalled. ``I felt I'd
have a big day. ... it didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Take away the four sacks, and Walton didn't have that awful of a
day statistically _ 16 of 27, 145 yards and one interception _ but
he also lost a fumble and the confidence of the coaching staff. His
practice reps dropped afterward and he played in only three of the
last nine games, attempting only 18 more passes, all against
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I lost confidence,'' the 6-foot-5-inch,
225-pound senior said. ``Some of the coaches said I did because of
the way they said I held myself afterward. But I wasn't down, like
I was a horrible person who couldn't do anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of people do that with a quarterback. It comes
with the job. Along with the head coach you get too much credit
when the team does well and too much criticism when you don't do
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Walton's biggest ally on Saturday, next to Williams, is the
change in offense and blocking schemes. Last year the Horns used
five- and seven-step pass drops and a sliding protection scheme.
Whichever way the pocket slid, UCLA always seemed to be able to
overload the other side, and the Horns were unable to adjust. The
Bruins sacked Walton and backup Marty Cherry seven times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I had been in the offense for a long time, I was a
little fuzzy on the protection schemes,'' Walton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally figured it out in the second quarter, after getting
our butts kicked, to adjust the other way,'' said guard Ben Adams.
``After that ... I'm not sure if we gave up, or just thought it
hopeless.''
</P>
<P>
   Walton's pass drops this year are 3 to 3 1/2 yards shorter _ the
longest will be five steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``That won't leave the tackles out by themselves as much,''
Walton said. ``Now they can push (the rusher) by. Last year if they
pushed them buy, they pushed them right into my face.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of pressure off the line,'' Adams said. ``Last
year we had to protect for four to five seconds. This year,
two-and-a-half to three. People think that half-second or so isn't
much, but it is to an offensive lineman.''
</P>
<P>
   The protection schemes, Walton said, allow him to read the
defense before the snap and know where the pressure will come, if
it does.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a team that believes in free-releasing the backs
(into pass patterns, regardless of the blitz), as we do, the
quarterback has to know,'' said offensive coordinator Greg Davis.
``That's why we stress always having your eyes in the right
place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll know 95 percent of the time which guy's not going to get
blocked,'' Walton said. ``It's my job to get rid of it before he
gets here.''
</P>
<P>
   That means that even if all goes right, he'll take some hits
just after releasing the ball. ``That's OK _ it's the blind-side
ones that I'm not expecting that I'm not big on,'' Walton said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Horns are confident in their new scheme, there is
the uncertainty of what UCLA will do. The Bruins will blitz _ who
wouldn't, after last year's grand success? _ but they have a new
defensive coordinator, former Oregon defensive whiz Nick Aliotti,
and a new 3-4 scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number one thing in picking up the blitz is knowing what
they can do,'' Adams said. ``We don't know what they'll do. What's
also good is failing at it. If we know where it's coming from, we
can fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This one's a little scary,'' Davis said. ``We have nothing to
go on except newspaper articles and some film from '94 (when
Aliotti was at Oregon).''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that calms Davis' heart has been the play of Walton.
Of Walton's 61 snaps against New Mexico State, about 30 were
audibles, in which he checked off from a package of anywhere from
two to five plays. Several of the Horns' big plays _ a 29-yard pass
to Bryan White on the first drive, a 15-yarder to Wane McGarity in
the third quarter _ were on audibles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time he got on the phones, what he told me was what was
happening,'' Davis said. ``Sometimes when they come out of a game,
they'll tell you things that aren't happening.''

   (NYT105) NEW YORK -- Sept. 11, 1998 -- ADV. FOR SUN., SEPT. 13
-- NY-FLOPHOUSE-B&AMP;W-5, 9-11 -- The Sunshine's afternoon clerk, Vic
K., has lived on the Bowery since 1961, when he arrived from his
home town of Youngstown, Ohio. A private man, he spends much of his
time indulging in his self-proclaimed vices: ``Drinking,
daydreaming and the horses.'' He also paints, writes and reads
philosophy. ``My mother was an alcoholic, my father was something
of a tyrant, and I just never fit in,'' he says. (Harvey Wang/New

<P>
   (NYT104) NEW YORK -- Sept. 11, 1998 -- ADV. FOR SUN., SEPT. 13
-- NY-FLOPHOUSE-B&AMP;W-4, 9-11 -- Bruce Davis is the main ``runner''
at The Sunshine - running errands for other residents for dollar
tips. Davis says he came to The Sunshine nine years ago on the run
from the law down South. From morning until night, he sits in the
lobby cross-legged and still until he is called into action.

been called ``the only deaf-mute crack addict on the Bowery,''
poses with his friend, Joseph Braddy. The two got to know each
other while Donogue was earning money handing out sign-language
alphabet cards on the subway. Braddy, a former psychology major and
substance abuse counselor, learned sign language so that they could
better communicate. (Harvey Wang/New York Times Photo)

the lobby of the Sunshine from 5 a.m. to noon, Saturday through
Thursday. He checks tenants in and out and answers the hotel's lone
phone with his signature smoky voice. Smith, who grew up in
Bedford-Stuyvesant, says he ended up on the Bowery sometime in the
1970s, after losing his bank job and his wife on the same day.

<TEXT>
<P>
   With the House of Representatives considering whether to begin
impeachment proceedings against a president for the first time in a
generation, members of Congress are looking to legal and political
history for standards to help them decide whether President
Clinton's conduct amounted to impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   What they are finding is a somewhat vague set of interpretations
of the Constitution's declaration that the chief executive can be
removed for treason, bribery ``or other high crimes and
misdemeanors.'' Because that history does not provide specific
rules for how to evaluate a case against the president, it is
already providing ammunition for both Clinton's critics and his
defenders.
</P>
<P>
   Many legal experts agree, however, that the Constitution and
impeachment efforts since the birth of the United States show that
the phrase ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' is intended to mean
significant abuses of power or challenges to the constitutional
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to qualify as a `high crime and misdemeanor,'
presidential conduct has to be established that amounts to an
assault on the constitutional foundation of the Republic,'' said
Bruce Ackerman, a professor of law and political science at Yale
University who has written about impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase ``high crimes and misdemeanors,'' several historians
said, was in use in England and colonial America to refer to
official offenses for which high government officials could be
brought to account. They said that the phrase did not mean minor
breaches of the law as the modern meaning of the term misdemeanor
would suggest.
</P>
<P>
   In their rebuttal to Starr's report Friday, Clinton's lawyers
focused on that issue. In the Constitution, high crimes and
misdemeanors meant ``wrongs committed against our system of
government,'' the rebuttal said. Impeachment, it said, ``was never
designed to allow a political body to force a president from office
for a very personal mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   It is equally clear, however, that impeachment is a political
process, even though it includes many elements of the legal system.
In the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton said impeachable
offenses ``are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be
denominated POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to injuries done
immediately to society itself.''
</P>
<P>
   But because impeachment is a political process, some legal
experts say, the definition of what might constitute high crimes
and misdemeanors might change over time. ``Alexander Hamilton would
plainly say to you that what (FM)high crimes and misdemeanors'
means depends on what the Congress says in the political context of
1998,'' said Eric Freedman, a professor at Hofstra University
School of Law.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are strong opinions on the subject, there is no
clear answer as to whether private sexual conduct, or even perjury
or obstruction of justice to cover-up an embarrassing relationship,
could be described as a high crime or misdemeanor within the
meaning of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The sentiment that ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' should be
flexibly defined was expressed most famously by Rep. Gerald Ford in
1970. During an impeachment investigation of Supreme Court Justice
William Douglas, the Michigan congressman and future president said
that ``an impeachable offense is basically whatever a majority of
the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment
in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal scholars say that abbreviated explanation has been widely
misunderstood. They say it correctly reflects that the process is
intended to be political.
</P>
<P>
   But most experts on impeachment say the Congress is bound by an
understanding that has evolved over several centuries that there
are strict limits on the Congress' use of the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectation is Congress will rise above everyday politics
and render a constitutional decision and that means the process
does not exist simply to vindicate political whims,'' said Michael
Gerhardt, a professor at William and Mary School of Law in
Williamsburg, Va. and the author of a book on impeachment law.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they were reading Starr's report Friday, members of the
House, which acts as the indicting body, were grappling with what
legal standard to apply. If the House charged Clinton, the Senate
would be called upon to rule on the charges. A two thirds vote in
the Senate would be required to remove Clinton from the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Among members of the House Judiciary Committee on Friday, there
was spirited discussion of what constitiutes an impeachable
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you this, it is not whatever we say it is. We are
constrained by the precedents'' said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a Democratic
member of the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Other members said they thought the test was whether there were
any violations by the president that might suggest that a failure
to punish him would leave the appearance that Clinton was above the
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think perjury is `high crimes and misdemeanors,' but people
are all over the board on that,'' said Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C., a
member of the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   There are few precedents to guide the discussion. Since 1789,
when the Constitution went into effect, the House has voted to
impeach just sixteen officials.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that sparse collection of cases and a few abortive
impeachment drives have established certain governing principles. A
failed effort to remove Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase in 1804
is often cited by legal experts as establishing the principle that
impeachment is not to be used to remove officials with whom
Congress has mere policy differences.
</P>
<P>
   And the Senate's failure by a single vote to remove President
Andrew Johnson in 1868 has come to stand for the proposition that
impeachment is not a device by which Congress can remove an
unpopular president.
</P>
<P>
   Although the battle to oust Johnson centered on his power to
control the membership of his Cabinet, many historians say the
motive of many in Congress was fury at the president's
Reconstruction policies toward the South.
</P>
<P>
   In anguished speeches at the time and in decisions some of them
published subsequently, senators of 1868 said the Johnson
impeachment was a test of whether the independent presidency could
survive.
</P>
<P>
   That analysis was reinforced by scholars and congressional
lawyers during the Watergate investigation of President Richard M.
Nixon a century later.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Holtzman, a former congresswoman from New York who was
a House Judiciary Committee member then, remembered Friday that she
and other members of Congress at the time studied the history of
earlier impeachment battles and the writings of the drafters of the
Constitution. They were convinced, she said, that they were bound
to follow the principles that evolved through history, even if
those principles were loose enough to leave open vast territory for
interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   The question before members of Congress now, Ms. Holtzman said,
is not simply whether they disapprove of Clinton's actions. ``They
have an obligation to understand what the Constitution means,'' Ms.
Holtzman said. ``It's not a question of opinion.''

POLITICS: YOU CAN'T WIN IF YOU DON'T PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, September 13, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN

<P>
   There was no better tonic with which to rinse away the rancid
taste of contemporary politics than to sit back under the vaulted
confines of Holy Name Church Thursday and hear Kirk O'Donnell's son
and daughter tell of how and why their dad loved the game.
</P>
<P>
   The pews were packed, the altar groaned with clerics _ eight
priests and a bishop by my count _ the music was rich and lofty and
overpowering, but the show was stolen by son Brendan, 19, a young
man with a remarkable ability to communicate the warmth and love of
a lucky family.
</P>
<P>
   Holly O'Donnell, 23, followed, telling how her father died of a
massive heart attack last Saturday. He'd been jogging in Scituate,
stopped to talk with a friend, and collapsed. What had they been
talking about, Holly asked the friend afterward. ``Politics.'' The
church erupted in laughter, with knowing grins breaking out on the
faces of all O'Donnell's pals, from the lowliest precinct hustler
to Vernon Jordan, whose list of close friends included Kirk as well
as Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Holly was told, her dad had been discussing how he
could help Mike Capuano, the mayor of Somerville, one of 10
Democrats contesting the 8th congressional district seat held for
so long by O'Donnell's mentor, Tip O'Neill. Surely this was Kirk
O'Donnell's last political endorsement: the hand reaching from
beyond the grave to pull one last ballot-lever.
</P>
<P>
   Capuano was touched. ``I'd only met Kirk once or twice, maybe a
few times, I didn't know him well,'' Capuano said Friday between
campaign stops. ``But everyone I respected in politics always
thought the world of him.''
</P>
<P>
   The man who Capuano says will win the 8th if he doesn't _ Ray
Flynn _ got his own little unexpected plug Thursday after a
lunchtime rally outside the Suffolk Courthouse, a building where,
as a young man, Flynn worked as a court officer after being cut by
the Celtics. There, Service Employees Union chief Eddie Sullivan
did the laying on of hands. ``My mother used to wash floors in bank
buildings'' and belonged to that union, Flynn reminisced.
</P>
<P>
   But after 30 years in politics, Flynn may be facing his own Last
Hurrah, nipped perhaps by Capuano, a younger Ray Flynn, or any of
three or four others in the crowded field. Flynn ``helped heal this
city in terms of race relations,'' said City Council ticket-topper
Mickey Roache. ``You can move in this city without fear of being
harassed or assaulted or intimidated, thanks to Ray Flynn.''
</P>
<P>
   Flynn has never trailed in the polls, despite a journalistic
haymaker from the Globe about his drinking and work habits as
ambassador to the Vatican, and he's been hammered by abortion
rights activists factions for being opposed to abortion. After
telling his union backers how he'll be a ``work and wages
Democrat'' in D.C. if elected, Flynn was approached by a woman
named Lillian Cain, a child protection lawyer from Newton who'd
happened by the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Cain said that in 1980 she had been running a home for unwed
mothers for the Salvation Army. She found a large house ``on the
Jamaicaway, right next to the (James Michael) Curley house,'' and
she was ready to move in with her unwed mothers when the neighbors
tried to block it. ``Mayor Flynn stepped in, and made it happen,''
she said. She's been a Flynn admirer ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The closing days of a campaign are the longest, the hardest, and
sometimes the cruelest. A year's effort and angst are on the line
Tuesday. Lives will be changed as a result of what voters decide.
And the people who risked all, many of them, will be cast down,
because there are always more losers than winners on Primary Night.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday afternoon, Jack Corrigan was racing to a post
office. ``I need $7,000 worth of stamps,'' he explained. The Globe
endorsed him for district attorney in Norfolk County, and he wanted
to mail 45,000 postcards with the endorsement's wording. ``But I
have to put the seven grand on my credit card, and I haven't told
my wife yet.''
</P>
<P>
   There are thousands of principled people politicking this
weekend, but their work and their worth are overshadowed by the
stench of scandal and partisan advantage-taking in D.C. The local
Democrats are debating what kind of reception Bill Clinton will or
should get Thursday night at a scheduled fund-raising dinner at the
Park Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   I can't think of a nobler thought to close out this primary
season than with with the afterword from the O'Donnell funeral
program, Ralph Waldo Emerson's definition of what constitutes a
successful life, as fine a politician's credo as exists:
</P>
<P>
   `` ... to win the respect of intelligent people and the
affection of children; to earn the appreciation of honest critics
and endure the betrayal of false friends; to appreciate beauty; to
find the best in others; to leave the world a little better place
than we found it, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a
redeemed social condition; to know even one life breathed easier
because you have lived. ... This is to have succeeded.''
</P>
<P>
   By that measure, the laborers in the political vineyard, be they
great or small, have succeeded, yet again, this dismal primary
season, when talk of lust and vengance soaks the words out of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   One fine thing about all political people, from the sign-holders
and footsoldiers to the strategists and candidates, is that they
risk their time and treasure to wage the battle none is ever sure
of winning. To abjure politics and things political is to retreat
from where decisions are made. You refuse to participate? Then you
are no better than a leaf landing in a rain-swollen gutter, to be
wafted along, spun round and round, and where you fetch up is
anybody's guess.
</P>
<P>
   But to risk, to dare, to work, to endure the taunts of a tabloid
age, to try to make a difference with no guarantee of success,
gives one a measure of direction, a vector of volition, and puts
you in position to do a little battle with fate. And that's all you
can ask, a chance to fight, to alter, a bit, for the better, the
condition of your world. The political game is like the lottery:
You can't win if you don't play.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Breaking and entering? Or marauding raccoon . . .
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ ``Hey,'' I tell the dispatcher who answers my
half-awake 9-1-1 call, ``I guess I know breaking and entering when
I hear it.'' The nice lady whom I envision sitting at a desk with
an official form in front of her and a midnight cup of coffee at
hand, tries to pry information from me, but her questions aren't
fitting my answers. Frustration slowly creeps into both of our
voices.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, back at the scene of the crime, I'm crouched under a
pile of quilts and groggily whispering my worst fears into a
cordless phone. ``I think it's looking at me,'' I hiss into the
receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ma'am, where are you?'' she demands rather loudly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sshhh!'' I caution, ``it'll hear you. I'm in the hammock,''
Silence. ``On the upstairs back porch,'' I explain getting louder.
More silence. It occurs to me that maybe I'm leaving out something
important so I try to explain. ``This is where I sleep in the
summertime...out here on the screened porch?'' Nothing. ``Until the
first frost?'' I hear breathing and hope it's the dispatcher.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly there's a thud against the screen followed by
scrabbling sounds. I freeze, and so does Stella, the white cat with
whom I share this sleeping arrangement. Her ears perk in the
direction of the scratching on the screen but she doesn't even turn
her head.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone is still talking to me, but now that I'm fully
awake, I'm having second thoughts. ``Can we just cancel this
call?'' I ask, promising to call back later to explain.
</P>
<P>
   Almost too quickly, the nice lady agrees. ``Yes ma'am, if you're
sure you're all right.'' I assure her I am and click off, holding
my breath for the next suspicious sound. It isn't long coming.
</P>
<P>
   There's a deep rumbling from somewhere in the neighborhood of my
kneecaps. It's Stella - growling. Not moving mind you, just
growling, but loudly enough to bring on the other half of my feline
dynamic duo. Biddy, a cold-natured Siamese who opts not to sleep al
fresco with the rest of the family, has arrived. And not too
quietly, I might add.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wowwr?'' is her inquisitive yowl as she jumps noisily onto the
porch rail and peers into the depths of the hammock. She's not even
tempted to join us. ``Aawoo....'' she begins another question but
breaks off mid-howl. Something has crashed onto the porch roof.
Stella and I freeze into what in hindsight is probably a pretty
silly-looking tableau - two chickens in a hammock (one wearing a
ketolysis), and wait for the next thud.
</P>
<P>
   As I wait, I think. Maybe it's a cat burglar, searching out a
second-story window for access to my jewels. Visions of Cary Grant
in ``To Catch a Thief'' dance through my fear-numbed brain. Then I
remember - I'm not Grace Kelly and I have no jewels.
</P>
<P>
   Now what? I try to talk myself into motion. Get out of the
hammock and investigate, I command myself.
</P>
<P>
   No way, my unmoving self answers back. If something's going to
get me it's going to have to find me first. A heartbeat later, I
think maybe it has.
</P>
<P>
   There's a scrabbling on the screen and Biddy who has been
crouched motionless on the rail, suddenly lets out a blood-curdling
shriek and goes airborne landing smack on top of Stella who
abandons the hammock so fast she leaves half of her white fur coat
behind. I hear them crashing down the stairs. Gone to protect their
food dishes, I'm thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's all up to me. Resigned to my fate, I reach for the
flashlight I keep beside the hammock, flick it on, and begin a scan
of the screen that surrounds three sides of my warm-weather aerie.
There's no moon, so there is no shape silhouetted against the flat
black canvas of the night. I wait.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, two curious eyeballs embedded in a furry masked face
stare into my flashlight beam. ``Hey,'' I say, ``you're a
raccoon.'' He doesn't answer. I tell him the cats can't come out to
play and he can't come in, so it must be time for him to go home.
He doesn't move and neither do I.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go home now,'' I order him but he doesn't listen. Instead he
lowers his head and moves his nose even closer to the screen. He
snuffs at me a couple of times, reaches for the nearest tree limb,
and with a rustle is gone. I wonder where.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning I find out. He left his calling card on the
front porch roof, just outside my office window - the same window
with the muddy raccoon footprints all over it. That's when I
remember my promise to call the 9-1-1 lady back. I'll be she can
hardly wait to hear this one.

ROME WROTE BOOK ON LEWD  
 (EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - If you think the Kenneth Starr report sounds seamy,
you should check out the original version, a kind of historical
``first draft.''
</P>
<P>
   For the contents of the current report, with its allegations of
kinky sex in the White House, sound surprisingly like the tales
told by Suetonius in his ``Lives of the Twelve Caesars,'' a history
of the first Roman emperors and their families.
</P>
<P>
   It is the original tabloid journalism and hardly reads like what
most people think of as dry classical literature.
</P>
<P>
   Suetonius dropped the dirt on Tiberius, for instance, who, in
the first century, grew so bored with administering the government
that he fell into debauches that in comparison must make Starr's
notorious 445-page document sound like the minutes of a Cub Scout
den meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``A detailed list of Tiberius' barbarities would take a long
time to compile,'' Suetonius wrote. ``I shall content myself with a
few samples.''
</P>
<P>
   You almost can see the legionnaires delivering boxes of
documents to the Roman senate. They outline the case:
</P>
<P>
   - Tiberius accepted a dinner engagement with Cestius Gallus on
the condition that the waitress for the evening be naked.
</P>
<P>
   - He is reported to have had sex with boys and girls in groups
of three ``to excite his waning passions.''
</P>
<P>
   - ``A number of small rooms were furnished with the most
indecent pictures and statuary obtainable, also certain erotic
manuals from Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   - The emperor also had built ``little nooks of lechery'' in the
woods, had boys and girls dress up as pans and nymphs and watched
them copulate.
</P>
<P>
   There were jokes among the populace, too. Wordplay was popular.
Nowadays, we joke that Bill Clinton may have been a little too
eager to ``free Willy.'' Back then, the man in the street joked
that the name of Tiberius Claudius Nero should instead be
``Biberius Caldius Mero,'' meaning ``drinker of strong hot wine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some aspects of his criminal obscenity are almost too vile to
discuss, much less believe,'' Suetonius wrote. You can imagine
Starr taking the same tone.
</P>
<P>
   There is something of the uptight high-school civics teacher to
both Starr and Suetonius. It isn't exactly that they envy the
action the national leader is getting, but they do both seem to be
relishing the details a little too lickerishly. Perhaps what they
envy is the popularity they see in those they despise.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are seldom popular people; they succeed or fail on
policy, not personality. Ronald Reagan was the one recent
exception.
</P>
<P>
   So they really don't know how to deal with anyone who (begin
ital) is (end ital) popular. The result is a tone of outrage.
</P>
<P>
   You can hear it in the angry letters to the editor that are
printed daily in the nation's newspapers. You can hear it in the
Roman historian:
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, Suetonius moralizes, training little boys, whom
Tiberius called his ``minnows,'' to chase him while he swam and to
nibble at him.
</P>
<P>
   He is reported to have abused infants in ways I cannot describe
in a family newspaper, although the very concept of a ``family
paper'' seems quaint considering what is reported daily on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it would be hard to argue that the Roman Empire was poorly
governed during the reign of the first handful of Caesars. Not
counting the four years under the obviously deranged Caligula and
the final years under Nero, the empire functioned reasonably well
under the Claudian emperors. For the most part, there was
prosperity and peace.
</P>
<P>
   The same seems true of the United States under Clinton. Like
Tiberius, he just seems to have had too much time on his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps if there had been a serious crisis during his
administration, Clinton would have had to focus on it rather than
on alternative uses for tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the serious crisis of Clinton's administration
has turned out to be the Lewinsky scandal, one originally so
trivial as to make the United States a laughingstock around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Tiberius was really guilty of the horrible crimes he was
accused of never really will be known. It was Tiberius' tragedy
that after his death it fell to senatorial historians to record his
reign and such historians as Suetonius and Tacitus felt no more
love for him than Starr seems to feel for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if only Republicans wrote his biography. &QL;

NEW DATA SHOW RAPID DECLINE IN JAPAN'S ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In the starkest sign so far of the depth of Japan's
recession, the government said Friday that the economy contracted
in the second quarter by an annual rate of 3.3 percent, nearly
twice as steep a fall as most economists had expected.
</P>
<P>
   This marked the first time that Japan's economy had contracted
for three consecutive quarters since the government began keeping
such statistics in 1955. Moreover, the economic data released
Friday suggest that the core of the economy slid even more rapidly
than it did earlier in the year, and there are fears that the
recession could get even worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japan economy is probably about to go through its darkest
moment,'' said Taichi Sakaiya, Japan's top economic official, at a
news conference Friday after the figures were announced. ``Tough
times will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   That spells trouble for other crisis-hit countries in Asia and
elsewhere. As the world's second-largest economy, Japan plays a
major role in influencing the trend of growth in the global
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The tough times in the real economy have also coursed through
the financial markets, which have been particularly jittery
recently because of instability abroad as well as in the wobbly
financial system at home.
</P>
<P>
   The economic figures were announced shortly after the close of
the busiest stock-trading day of the year, but even without the
news of the depth of the recession, stocks in Tokyo spiraled
downward in their biggest single-day decline so far this year. The
benchmark Nikkei average plunged 5.11 percent from its previous
close to end at 13,916.98, down 749.05 points.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market rallied, sending the yield on the benchmark
10-year government bond to a record low Friday of 0.78 percent,
just after having set a record on Thursday. Japanese long-term bond
yields are already the lowest long-term interest rates of any
country in history.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, politicians have become deadlocked in a bitter battle
in Parliament over how to handle the nation's jittery financial
system. Just on Friday, the main opposition party pulled out of
negotiations on the bad-debt crisis, saying that it would not
resume talks unless the government abandoned its plan to use
taxpayers' money to bail out the Long-Term Credit Bank, one of the
nation's largest and weakest institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The economic data on Friday showed that domestic demand was
weak, with consumer spending falling significantly, along with
corporate investment. Deflation is spreading, with prices, profits
and pay for workers all dropping. With corporate profits
plummeting, companies are being forced to cut back on production,
investment spending and hiring, which in turn could lead
consumption to fall further.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Japan is skirting the edge of a deflationary spiral,'' said
Sakaiya, who heads the Economic Planning Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists cautioned, however, that even if Japan dipped
into a deflationary spiral, it did not mean that Japan was doomed
to fall into an even deeper economic abyss.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we talk about a deflationary spiral, the sense is that
once it's started, we're finished, sucked into a vortex and there's
no way out,'' said Christopher J.R. Calderwood, chief economist at
Jardine Fleming Securities (Asia) Ltd. ``If we are there now, I
don't think the economy will consume itself over the next two
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Sakaiya of the Economic Planning Agency said that he expected
economic performance in the third quarter also to be weak and that
a recovery might not come for another two years. That is
disappointing, given that the government is now carrying out a
giant fiscal stimulus package, worth about $123 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo has made a lot of noise about the billions of dollars it
says it is spending on bolstering the economy. Yet a consensus is
building among economists that the spending in 1998 will be just
barely above spending levels in 1997, when the economy was still
growing, and not nearly enough to lift Japan out of a recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``The implication for the market is that the Japanese economy
still hasn't bottomed out, fiscal policy is not working and Japan
is on the road to fiscal ruin,'' said Andrew Shipley, an economist
at Schroders Japan Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Although gross domestic product, or GDP, did not decline this
time as much as it did in the first quarter, when the economy
contracted by an annual 5.3 percent, the breakdown by sectors
troubles some economists even more.
</P>
<P>
   Imports fell by about 25 percent on an annual basis, which hurts
other Asian countries because Japan traditionally is a major
importer of products from the rest of the region. But exports also
fell, mainly because Asian countries, in turn, cut their purchases
of Japanese products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though GDP looks a little better, the mix is very, very
bad,'' said Jeffrey Young, an economist at Salomon Smith Barney in
Tokyo. ``It's bad for Japan. It's bad for everyone else.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Torrential rains will persist in south-central Texas on Saturday
as the remnants of Tropical Storm Frances meander farther inland.
Serious flooding is possible if the rain bands linger over the hill
country near San Antonio. Another large cluster of gusty
thundershowers will drench Louisiana, western Mississippi and
southern Alabama. The shield of clouds associated with this
tropical system will stretch from the Big Bend of Texas to the
southern Ozarks and eastward to the South Carolina coast.
</P>
<P>
   Unseasonably warm air will sweep into the Northeast on balmy
breezes from the southwest. Sunshine will be dimmed by intervals of
clouds and it will become more humid. Meanwhile, a weakening cold
front moving east from the Great Lakes will trigger a few
thundershowers in the northern Appalachians. The Northeast Coast
will be bright and very warm.
</P>
<P>
   A wedge of slightly cooler, but noticeably drier air will occupy
the upper Great Lakes. High pressure will glide east toward
northern New England and this will help push a cold front into
southern New England by Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rain will fall in the western Dakotas, eastern Montana and
parts of Wyoming as low pressure forms over the region. A stream of
moisture from the Tropics will produce afternoon thunderstorms in
the central Rockies and northern Arizona. High pressure building
into British Columbia will cause the surface winds to blow offshore
from San Francisco to the Columbia River. As a result, warmer air
will be drawn toward portions of the Pacific Coast under mainly
sunny skies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Notorious Rainmakers &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dying tropical storms are notorious for producing heavy rain
over the hill country of Texas after they make landfall and churn
west. Last month, the remnants of west-bound Tropical Storm Charley
dumped prodigious rains over Del Rio, Texas. Though winds decrease
after landfall, dying tropical systems still retain much of their
original dowries of moisture. As tropical air reaches the hill
country, it ascends the sloping terrain, boosting the lift needed
for intensifying rains. Saturday, the remnants of Tropical Storm
Francis will likely follow the very wet lead of Tropical Storm
Charley.

`CURSE ON THE GYPSIES': DEFENDING A MUCH-MALIGNED PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for

<TEXT>
<P>
   No, the spooky title, ``Curse on the Gypsies,'' is not meant as
an unfashionable expletive. On the contrary, this two-hour
documentary defends a much abused people against the bad reputation
and harsh treatment they have endured in many lands over many
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The case made here is that the 8 to 12 million people known as
the Rom constitute a culture united by language and customs. They
owe the title Gypsy to a misapprehension that they originated in
Egypt, but linguistic analysis traces their origins to northwestern
India, where they may have been a military force against Muslim
invaders. In the Middle Ages, we are told, they found their way
through Persia, Turkey and Greece, and with the fall of Byzantium
the dispersed groups traveled into the Balkans and then through
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   With little in the way of a written record as a guide, this
program's students of the Romany language must rely on oral
tradition and perhaps a touch of wishfulness. (Someone says Gypsy
children receive a good education despite not being taught to read
or write.)
</P>
<P>
   Gypsy disinclination to assimilate, combined with the reluctance
of Europeans to accept these dark-complexioned people, has fed
continuing suspicion and persecution. Their nomadic habits and
occupations as roving entertainers and fortunetellers (they are
credited with giving civilization the playing card) stamped them
with a lingering reputation as con artists and petty thieves.
</P>
<P>
   The program's observers draw attention to more wholesome
talents, like musical innovation and metalworking, along with
family values and spiritual concerns, none of which saved thousands
from Nazi medical laboratories and death camps. Even today, it is
noted, the Gypsies do not find a warm welcome in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Neither this program's history nor the memories of Americanized
descendants go very deep, but they may act as something of a
corrective for a viewer whose main encounter with Gypsies has been
as an unlucky or suspicious tourist abroad.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Elaine's is too streetwise. Le Bilboquet is too
French. Le Cirque 2000 might be fine for lunch, but at night, when
it's filled with celebrities and out-of-towners toasting
anniversaries, forget it. Up and down Park Avenue last week, among
the crowd that passes for the 1990s version of the Social 400, a
wail went up: Where will we eat now that Mortimer's is closed?
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant beneath the brown awning at 75th Street and
Lexington Avenue was shut on Tuesday after the death of its owner,
Glenn Bernbaum. Since 1976, he had been the host and gatekeeper of
perhaps the clubbiest public restaurant in the United States, icily
indifferent to those he didn't know, but dapper and welcoming to
boldface names like Pat Buckley, Brooke Astor, Nan Kempner, Liz
Smith, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Mary McFadden, Iris Love and
Reinaldo and Carolina Herrera.
</P>
<P>
   Some went to Mortimer's for lunch and dinner four or five times
a week, and many held private parties there.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people are going to be lost,'' said Kenneth Jay Lane,
the society jewelry designer, who ate there at least twice a week.
``Including me.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the food, moderately priced and as varied as
sweetbreads and hamburgers, that drew the senior socialites,
although many found it very tasty. Nor was it the decor, which made
a simple statement in mahogany and mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   No, the unquestionable lure was that Mortimer's was a haven,
providing assurance to its regulars of their social status in a
world that now has precious little use for social status. Bernbaum,
a former menswear executive, sat in a back corner day and night,
keeping watch over his sanctum sanctorum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like going to a club,'' Lane said. ``If you wanted to
be cozy, if you wanted to see friends and dress any way you like,
that's where you would go and always get a table.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, only those in an inner circle could get one of the 19
tables in the main dining room. As much as Bernbaum, who was 76 at
his death, was loved by his regulars, he was often haughty and
cutting to strangers. People he did not know who greeted him
pleasantly would often get a ``harrumph'' in reply. Then his
right-hand man, the maitre d'hotel, Robert Carvaggi, would escort
them to a side room, its tables invisible to the main goings-on.
</P>
<P>
   Unaccompanied, classically dressed women, who might have known
someone in the dining room, were happily shown to the bar, where
they felt comfortable having a drink alone. But women with skirts a
little too short or hair a little too blond were escorted to the
side room or even told that the room was closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were a single woman who was not very important, he
didn't know you,'' a 31-year-old writer said, adding that she
wasn't on Bernbaum's radar _ he never made eye contact with her.
</P>
<P>
   But Herrera, who was a regular with his wife, the designer,
explained Bernbaum's seeming snobbism by saying, ``He was shy.''
The impeccably mannered Herrera, who is a special projects editor
at Vanity Fair but is more widely known from the party pages of W
magazine, continued: ``He was brusque with people he didn't know.
He was an elitist. He liked the best of everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was delighted to seat Arthur Schlesinger Jr., Norman
Mailer, Brooke Astor or Estee Lauder. He liked quality. He liked
people who did things.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't a snob at all. People said he liked old money. He
just liked the manners old money had.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mrs. Kempner, who was almost always given Table 1, to the right
of the front door, for the five or so meals she ate each week at
Mortimer's, sounded shaken at Bernbaum's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Blass called to tell me the news,'' she said from Venice,
Italy, where she is working on a cookbook. ``I can't imagine what
I'm going to do without Glenn.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Kempner would run out of wine at one of her famous
dinner parties at her duplex apartment on Park Avenue, she would
simply call the restaurant, a few blocks away, and Bernbaum would
send up a case. Herrera said that Bernbaum sent over finger
sandwiches for the Herreras' cocktail parties.
</P>
<P>
   Neither he nor any other regulars could say what would replace
Mortimer's. The loss was a topic of conversation in telephone calls
last week that crisscrossed the Upper East Side and flew across the
Atlantic on the lines that link the jet set to Paris, Switzerland
and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   As Lane put it: ``The Upper East Side is closing. Do I have to
explain it? It's just closing.''
</P>
<P>
   In his will, Bernbaum, who seemed intent on having Mortimer's
follow him to the grave, insisted that the restaurant be closed for
good. He owned the building that housed it, as well as its liquor
license. Bernbaum's lawyer, Richard Golub, said, ``I'm struggling
with the legal aspects of whether a restaurant can ever be open in
that spot again.'' He said that 99 percent of the estate had been
left to the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center for AIDS
research.
</P>
<P>
   The will also stated that Bernbaum wanted no funeral or memorial
service. Herrera's explanation was that Bernbaum had come to think
that funerals these days are simply too snobbish, events at which
the dead compete posthumously for the most impressive speakers, the
most impressive guests.

AGAINST TERRORISTS, `WAR' IS A RHETORICAL FLOURISH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN ENGELBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In some ways, Osama bin Laden is a thoroughly modern terrorist.
He announces his intentions on CNN, directs his worldwide financial
network by satellite telephone and sends messages to his supporters
in Saudi Arabia via cassette tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Asked last year by a Western reporter what operations were
planned next in his jihad, or holy war, against the United States,
bin Laden replied: ``You'll see or hear about them in the media,
God willing.''
</P>
<P>
   But terrorism experts say that bin Laden's aims place him firmly
in the traditions of an earlier epoch, a time when terrorism was
used to strike a blow against apostasy rather than achieve specific
goals like national independence.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction is more than a quibble for theoreticians in the
growing field of terrorism studies. American leaders have declared
war on bin Laden and his brand of terrorism, a rhetorical flourish
that leaves unanswered the questions of how the West intends to
combat a millennial movement that flouts the rules of conventional
warfare and has no evident state sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the 20th century, bombings and assassinations have
been the tools of ethnic groups fighting for their own nation
states. The tactics were undeniably brutal, and the consequences
global. One of the most notable terrorist attacks of the century,
the 1914 assassination of an Austro-Hungarian Archduke by a Serb
nationalist, ignited World War I.
</P>
<P>
   The aims of these groups could be politically delineated.
Bosnian Serbs, for instance, wanted to escape Austro-Hungarian rule
and join Serbia, a desire that re-emerged with the breakup of
Yugoslavia in 1991. The Irish were striving for independence from
Britain, as were the Jews living in what was then Palestine. The
disputes about land and power were subject to political
negotiation. For most of these groups, terror ultimately helped
them prevail. As Walter Laqueur, a political scientist, noted in
his 1987 book, ``The Age of Terrorism,'' ``To succeed, terrorist
demands have to be `realistic' (i.e. limited in character).''
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden's loosely organized Al Qaeda movement is pursuing
goals that are vaguer and far harder to define or satisfy. Experts
say it is part of an increasingly significant trend in which
terrorist groups espouse millennial or religious ideologies that
transcend politics or national borders.
</P>
<P>
   In his rambling 1997 interview with CNN, bin Laden said his
jihad against the United States would conclude only when Washington
withdrew from Saudi Arabia and ended its ``aggressive intervention
against Muslims in the whole world.''
</P>
<P>
   His remarks were dotted with references to Islamic tradition,
invoking God and reminding viewers that it was not permissible for
non-Muslims to remain as protectors in Saudi Arabia. He has made
clear that his targets included the governments of Egypt and Saudi
Arabia, which he deems insufficiently devout.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Hoffman, a teacher of international relations at the
University of St. Andrews in Scotland, said the ideology of bin
Laden and other emerging Islamic groups harks backs to the earliest
known forms of terrorism, when religion was the main justification
for what another scholar has termed ``holy terror.''
</P>
<P>
   From A.D. 66-73, a Jewish sect known as the Zealots took up arms
against the Roman occupation, using daggers to slit the throats of
Romans and Jews who collaborated, and their rebellion had both
religious and political overtones.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1090 and 1272, a Muslim Shia sect known as the Assassins
fought to repel the Christian Crusaders with a campaign of murder
intended to bring on a new millennium. The literal translation of
``assassin,'' hashish eater, refers to the acts of ``ritual
intoxication'' undertaken by the warriors before their missions,
Hoffman writes in his new book, ``Inside Terrorism'' (Columbia
University Press, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   Although there were scattered instances of fundamentalist,
Islamic-inspired violence in the early decades of the 20th century,
the issue achieved international prominence only after the Iranian
revolution brought to power a Shiite regime in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Tehran began financing and arming Shiite proxies in Lebanon, and
when the United States backed the government in that country's
civil war, the groups fought back, bombing the American Embassy and
Marine barracks in Beirut and seizing hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden's religiously justified program of violence echoes the
public proclamations of those groups, with an important
distinction: He is independently wealthy and operates from
countries like Afghanistan or Albania, which have minimal or
nonexistent governments. The Reagan administration could negotiate
with Iran for release of the hostages; bin Laden appears beholden
to no specific government.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman noted that many of the major terrorist attacks of the
1990s were executed by groups without state sponsors and specific
goals. These include the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center by
Islamic radicals with ties to bin Laden and the March 1995 attack
on Tokyo's subways with nerve gas by a Japanese religious cult.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden proclaimed his holy war against the United States on
Aug. 23, 1996, in a document titled: ``Message from Osama bin Laden
to His Muslim Brothers in the Whole World and Especially the Arab
Peninsula: Declaration of Jihad Against the Americans Occupying the
Land of the Two Holy Mosques,'' a reference to the continued
American military presence in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   The United States did not respond.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, after investigators tied bin Laden's group to
the bombing of American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed
more than 250 people, including 12 Americans, Clinton
administration officials launched a cruise missile attack on his
camps in Afghanistan and declared war. ``This is, unfortunately,
the war of the future,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Terrorism experts applauded the military action as the sort of
quick response Secretary of State George Schultz was urging in the
1980s when he said the United States could no longer be the
``Hamlet of nations.'' But they said the notion of announcing and
prosecuting a war against someone like bin Laden posed significant
conceptual problems, both for policy-makers and the American
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that she used the term war, because it's very
misleading. Americans like their wars to be short, with no
casualties, and then we kick back and watch the Super Bowl,'' said
David Long, a former State Department official.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flu would be a better simile. Every year there's a new strain
of flu, and every two or three years one is lethal. You manage it.
You're not going to win the war on flu.''
</P>
<P>
   For theorists, the notion of a war on terrorism is inherently
contradictory. Western nations fight wars according to generally
accepted conventions that govern legitimate targets, treatment of
prisoners and types of weapons. Terrorists flout those same rules
in the hopes of attracting publicity and striking a blow against a
more powerful opponent.
</P>
<P>
   For example, terrorist groups assassinate political leaders. The
United States has an executive order banning murder plots, though
Presidents Reagan, Bush and Clinton have authorized bombing raids
aimed at the hideouts of certain adversaries, including Saddam
Hussein, the Iraqi leader, and Muammar Gadhafi, the Libyan leader.
</P>
<P>
   Western governments strive to avoid civilian casualties;
terrorists seek to cause them.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorist take hostages, a move Western nations generally avoid
in warfare and would not consider in the fight against groups like
bin Laden's.
</P>
<P>
   Governments, including the United States, have used their legal
system to bring terror suspects to justice, but that means
subjecting the evidence and witnesses to the public scrutiny of an
open trial.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it clear what weapons would work in such a conflict.
Terrorists have a minimal infrastructure. There are no big
buildings to bomb or headquarters to destroy. The cruise missile
attack on Afghanistan appears to have destroyed some rudimentary
camps, which can quickly be rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``War, in its accepted definition, is fighting of a specific
duration on an identifiable battlefield against an enemy you
know,'' Hoffman said. ``I think Albright made a big mistake
couching it in these terms. This war is not fought on any one
battlefield. It's timeless. And you're not going to defeat your
enemy.''

PIT?

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 13)  
 (af)  
 By LAURA PEDERSEN-PIETERSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was time, Eileen Sverchek told her husband 14 years ago, to
get a more respectable job. ``She was very instrumental in my
giving up being a full-time blackjack player,'' Nicholas Sverchek
III recalled during a moment stolen from his current office _ a
clerk's booth near the cocoa futures pit at the Coffee, Sugar and
Cocoa Exchange in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   You may have seen Sverchek's workplace in ``Trading Places,''
the 1983 Eddie Murphy-Dan Aykroyd film; the exchange was the
setting for the scenes of frantic orange-juice trading at the
movie's climax. More recently, the exchange made a cameo in Tim
Allen's 1997 movie, ``Jungle 2 Jungle.''
</P>
<P>
   But apart from catching such glimpses at the local multiplex,
you might never know that commodity exchanges exist. The New York
Stock Exchange trading floor is the backdrop for all those business
reports on television. But both the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa
Exchange and the New York Cotton Exchange _ the two are merging to
form the Board of Trade of New York _ are closeted on the eighth
floor of the World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, these exchanges are rarely mentioned when
conversations turn to the health of the markets. But should you be
scarfing a double dip of Chunky Monkey at Ben &AMP; Jerry's in the
trade center's shopping mall, it's more than likely that the cocoa
beans in it traded hands between importer and roaster 150 feet
above the spot where you're taking your licks.
</P>
<P>
   On any given day, representatives of Hershey, M&AMP;M/Mars, Nestle
and others are up there scrambling to make sure they own enough
cocoa to keep you in candy bars.
</P>
<P>
   Formed in 1882, the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange is the
premier world market for futures and options trading in cocoa. Its
average monthly volume of 150,000 contracts _ each representing 10
metric tons of cocoa beans _ makes Willy Wonka and his Chocolate
Factory look like chump change. We're talking about enough
Toblerone to fill the Central Park Reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   Like other exchanges, this one has a limited number of seat
memberships; as a result, most orders arrive on the floor via
telephone. This is where clerks like Sverchek take charge, making
sure that the orders reach the cocoa pit quickly and efficiently
and are executed at the best possible price, and then immediately
reporting the results to the clients.
</P>
<P>
   The job's roots run deep in the history of such exchanges, back
to when trading was outdoors. But a question about the future hangs
over the pits: How long before clerks holding No. 2 pencils and
traders throwing hand signals are replaced by computers?
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, trading began on the Cantor Exchange, the first
electronic futures exchange in the United States. The trades are in
Treasuries, not commodities of the kind that change hands on the
Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the new system enables market participants anywhere to
trade directly, anonymously and efficiently via computer _
bypassing both clerk and broker.
</P>
<P>
   Confronting a potentially uncertain future is old news to
Sverchek. In the early 1980s, being a self-employed blackjack
player was an increasingly risky vocation.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned with shrinking profits, Atlantic City casinos were
revising the rules in favor of the house and were keeping a keen
eye out for ``sharps,'' the professionals who rely on probability
theory to count cards, thus bending the odds in their favor and
cutting into casino revenues.
</P>
<P>
   So, Sverchek said, when he was caught giving his brother a
``Little Rascals''-style hand-wag under the chin, signaling him to
bet big, the pit boss hastily dealt them out.
</P>
<P>
   What better time for a career change? As Lady Luck would have
it, a friend had been prodding Sverchek to forsake his leather
stool at Bally's for ``the biggest casino in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   One look at a commodities trading floor was all it took. ``The
exchange had all the din and excitement of Disneyland,'' he said,
``along with the feeling that I could become a player in the global
marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Sverchek never went back to the boardwalk. With a solid
background in numbers from his gaming days, he was hired as a clerk
for a trading firm in the silver and gold pits at the Comex in New
York. Though it paid only $10,000 a year, it was a real job with
potential, and that made a hit with Eileen.
</P>
<P>
   Today, clerical jobs on trading floors start as low as $15,000 a
year and pay as high as $70,000, excluding bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Like most other freshman floor clerks, Sverchek experienced the
trial-by-fire learning curve. A few minutes after arriving for his
first day of work, he was tossed a phone. On the other end, a
crazed customer screamed, ``How are they?''
</P>
<P>
   He glanced around and thought that his new colleagues looked
fine, if perhaps a bit pale. The voice yelled again _ ``How's the
March future?'' and this time added something about Treasuries.
Well, Sverchek thought, why didn't you say so?
</P>
<P>
   Floor clerk has many responsibilities, from keeping track of
positions and helping customers decide how to execute orders to
relaying market information from brokers in the trading pits to
clients on the phone. Clerks must also unsnarl the mistakes and
miscommunications of others.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, after two years of learning the ropes, Sverchek landed
a different clerical job, at $15,000 a year. ``This guy asked me to
take some papers downstairs for him,'' he recalled. He executed the
favor and was stunned to receive a $500 tip for a moment's work.
``Hey, can I work for you?'' he entrepreneurially inquired. For the
next few years Sverchek was a clerk in the metals markets for the
big tipper, an independent floor trader.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1992, Sverchek arrived at the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa,
hired by Dapco Brokerage, the largest firm on the exchange, at more
than double his previous salary. Today he can be found briskly
running Dapco's booth near the edge of the cocoa trading pit, an
oversized _ and often frantic _ sandbox of shredded paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the eyes and ears of the exchange for my customers,''
Sverchek said as he worked two phones effortlessly, recording
trades while keeping one eye on the news ticker and the other on a
broker executing an order in the pit.
</P>
<P>
   Sverchek enjoys his job _ as well as the additional task of
putting out a daily report on the cocoa market for his firm's top
clients. This includes a summary of who is buying and selling, a
technical explanation of the market's overall strengths and
weaknesses, and, at the end, his own assessment of whether the
price will rise or fall in coming days and weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Sverchek became a ``member clerk'' on the Coffee, Sugar
and Cocoa Exchange, qualified to trade for his own account. But he
says he doesn't trade much for himself and that when he does, it is
not as a high roller.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market can be very hectic,'' he said, ``and I have to keep
my mind on the job.'' He also said he never wants to go home and
say to his children _ Nicholas, 16, and Amanda, 14 _ `` `Guess
what? You're not going to go to college.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Sverchek is happy to concentrate on the cocoa market
for his customers and collect his high-end clerk's pay and yearly
bonus, which can run up to 10 percent of the salary. ``Sure, it's
stressful,'' he said, ``but you learn ways of coping so that it
doesn't burn a hole in your stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the long term, the fresh, youthful, mostly male faces at
the exchange underscore that this is not only a man's game but a
young man's, so it's not a bad idea to have a back-up career plan.
</P>
<P>
   This is especially true since the Chicago Board of Trade voted
last month to start electronic trading of financial contracts
during the daytime, side by side with the raucous, centuries-old
open-outcry system. And when Cantor Fitzgerald LP won approval for
its new computerized venture, its partner was the Board of Trade of
New York, Sverchek's exchange in its new, merged incarnation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inevitable that it will eventually all be done
electronically,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So Sverchek, an old hand in the futures markets, is considering
his own future. He wants to do full-time market commentary _
perhaps for corporations, or on television _ but for now, he is
excited about working in the fast-paced commodities pits for as
long as the action lasts. In fact, he has only one bite-sized
complaint. ``You won't believe it,'' he confided, ``but we never
get any free chocolate.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For men in search of fall basics, the good news is
that that is practically all there is.
</P>
<P>
   Labor Day, of course, heralds an end to white pants and pastel
colors and a return to sober work wear. There is abundant proof of
that this year at Barneys New York, Bergdorf Goodman and Saks Fifth
Avenue, where simple dark suits, jackets and pants are in ample
supply. But for those who see this as a time for die-hard shopping,
the pickings for a jaunty sport coat _ a bit of anti-camouflage for
the fall _ are slim.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are scores of beautiful and distinctive plaids
available from traditional houses like Burberry and Brioni, where
the colorful sport coat has a tradition of its own. But in the
vanguard, there are only a few models that stand out.
</P>
<P>
   At Romeo Gigli, 21 East 69th St., the blazer of the season has a
covered placket, so the two buttons are invisible, a small touch on
a neatly tailored coat. Available in green and maroon velvet and
sand and charcoal wool, among others, the jacket, $1,110, has a
subdued cleverness that makes it good for work and play.
</P>
<P>
   A purplish four-button jacket, $1,007, by Jean Paul Gaultier at
Untitled, 26 West Eighth St., in Greenwich Village, has a sharkskin
glint, yet is simply tailored and goes as well with a tie and
trousers as with a T-shirt and jeans.
</P>
<P>
   At Bergdorf Goodman, a black-and-red-plaid wool coat, $995, by
the London tailor-couturier Richard James is laced with a fuchsia
lining for extra flash. At Barneys New York, a black Comme des
Garcons jacket, $935, has exposed darts and seaming on the chest
and arms, lending an otherwise simple jacket a touch of humor
(usually more welcome in people than in clothes).
</P>
<P>
   Unstructured jackets can function like cardigans with backbone.
A loden-green camel's-hair jacket from Prada, $1,120, is warm
enough to be worn without a topcoat. A lighter-weight brown wool
stretch jacket from Jil Sander, at Bergdorf for $1,130, won't keep
you as warm. Fear not: The designer has also made a car coat in
thicker beige wool, $1,535.
</P>
<P>
   Some jackets are so unconstructed that they should just be
called sweaters. At Gigli, a blue wool jacket is faced with a
ribbed wool that looks and feels like a knit but can take wear and
tear like a woven ($1,110). And at Bergdorf, Etro offers a stoutly
knit jacket, $850, in navy wool and acrylic, with a covered
placket. It is about as close to a sweater as a sport coat dares to
get.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on a customer's taste, these may be too tame _ or not
tame enough. With a sport coat, the best advice to follow is Jean
Cocteau's credo for tact, that is, knowing how far to go too far.

   NEW YORK _ Falling asleep in your clothes never seemed very
appealing. But now Maxfield Parish, known for lavish leather and
shearling jackets, is introducing a home collection to be carried
by Henri Bendel that makes it seem redundant to dress in the first
place. There are leather blankets (starting at $1,300), rabbit
throws with cashmere backing ($1,400 to $5,000) and beanbag chairs
in shearling, $2,400.
</P>
<P>
   Other designers, too, are making home furnishings that seem an
extension of the closet. Oliver Spencer, the British designer, is
doing velvet beaded pillows. Tracy Feith is making silk lampshades.
Beth Schaeffer now has a collection of table and bed ware, sold at
ABC Carpet and Home, ranging from pearl-edge sheer organdy napkins
($25) to a velvet duvet ($600) that could be mistaken for a
king-size dress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lifestyle thing, meant to match what we do for women's
clothing each season,'' said Julie Diller, Ms. Schaeffer's partner.

   Fashion Game, Set and Match
</P>
<P>
   Except for Wimbledon, the days of all-white tennis gear are long
gone. But at this year's U.S. Open, the women seemed to compete in
a grand slam event of daring style. Monica Seles may have lost
early to Martina Hingis, but she made it to the fashion finals in
her lingerie-sheer, micro-mini black nylon dress by Nike, which
reminded fashion editors of a Givenchy couture cocktail dress.
Underneath, it had a form-fitting body suit made from Dri-Fit (a
fabric that helps perspiration evaporate quickly), which let her
change the dress right on court.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hingis wore her hair in a vertical ponytail, borrowing from
Patrick Rafter, last year's men's champion. Mary Pierce added
points to her fashion ranking with accessories: pearls and a tattoo
peeking from the shoulder of her signature body-hugging Nike
dresses (a look booed at the French Open).
</P>
<P>
   Anna Kournikova stopped short of the bikini-style outfits she's
often photographed in, sporting instead sexy little skirts and
dresses. Venus Williams aced the bra-top competition, wearing
revealing halter, T-back tops from a line she helped design.

   Poker Face to Go

   Women who want to turn back time and erase the frown lines in
their foreheads aren't the only ones queuing up to have botulism
toxins, or Botox, injected into their faces. Dermatologists are
reporting an increasing number of men getting the shots, and not
just to have a youthful mien.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure, which eliminates wrinkles by paralyzing some
facial muscles, also minimizes facial expression. And now some male
lawyers and investment bankers and executives see the lack of
expression as an advantage in business dealings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say it helps them in presentations, because people can't
really see what they're thinking,'' said Dr. Debra Jaliman, a
Manhattan dermatologist. Dr. Patricia Wexler, another Manhattan
dermatologist, said more male patients were asking for Botox.
``People think it makes them look more positive and self-assured,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   A real-estate executive who is a patient of Dr. Jaliman said:
``I do a lot of tension frowning, and Botox relieves that. In
negotiations it allows you to not give away your feelings, and when
you look relaxed, that's the secret to success.'' The effect wears
off in three to five months should a patient miss the ability to
raise an eyebrow.

   Really Bad Shirts
</P>
<P>
   Ugly shirts never looked so good. Witness the explosion of
horrifying polyester in current movies. In ``Rounders,'' Edward
Norton plays a poker hustler and ex-convict with a taste for
out-of-date, perhaps never-in-fashion shirts.
</P>
<P>
   In ``There's Something About Mary,'' Matt Dillon's
detective-stalker character sports a loud Manilla shirt. And in
Nicolas Cage's latest action movie, ``Snake Eyes,'' his shirt is a
frightful brown and gold button-down.
</P>
<P>
   There's something sexy and dangerous about a guy so bad that he
doesn't care how ugly his shirt is. Terry Dresbach, the costume
designer of ``Rounders,'' worked at getting the bad shirts just
right.
</P>
<P>
   Norton's shirt, a $3 thrift-shop poly-chiffon blend with brown
and orange flowers, was ``vintage '60s _ sheer, scary,'' she said,
and paired well with skinny Helmut Lang pants. For the Russian
mobster in the movie, played by John Malkovich, she chose a shirt
with marbleized squares and a stretch waistband, which was found in
a shop in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, and, she said, well worth the
$125. ``It's a very anti-fashion movie,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not really. For spring 1999, the men's shows were filled with
garish prints and clashing colors. Gene Meyer showed sequins. John
Scher offered bright aqua and pink. John Bartlett had lime-green
hibiscus print jackets. And Sandy Dalal came up with
pistachio-green floral print shirts.
</P>
<P>
   How to choose one that doesn't say, ``Reject, even in the 10th
grade''? Scher said: ``You hold it up to yourself and say, `Do I
look like a loser?''' It's a fine line.

<P>
   As a high school freshman, I read a fat paperback book
containing selected excerpts from taped conversations in the Nixon
White House. The phrase ``expletive deleted'' appeared on page
after page, as the president and his lieutenants schemed and
plotted and lied and deceived.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Jim Bouton's salacious expose ``Ball Four'' had
shattered any youthful illusions I'd had about baseball players,
the White House transcripts killed any naive notions I had about
presidents and their appointed knights.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out Mickey Mantle and Richard Nixon were terribly flawed
human beings, just like everyone else. It was probably good for me
to learn that lesson at a young age.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of a century later, I'm old enough to run for any
office, including the presidency _ not that I'd ever seriously
entertain such a masochistic endeavor. And, I'm at the age where
I'd be considering retirement had I been gifted with the ability to
play professional baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Two and a half decades of witnessing the ways of this world have
added hundreds of layers of hard varnish to that young cynic who
learned the truth about politics and baseball back in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Like thousands of my fellow Americans, I spent Friday afternoon
perusing another thick ``book'' about a president in crisis _ only
this time the book appeared on my computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   They're calling it the Starr Report. The Tar-and-Feather report
might be a more accurate description.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations: Bill Clinton fooled around with an intern! Then
he lied to us about it! Why, he even tried to get others to lie
about it as well!
</P>
<P>
   Well, no kidding. Didn't we all have that figured out months
ago, and don't the majority of Americans feel this is hardly
grounds for impeachment or the basis for resignation?
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it was still shocking to see the details of the
relationship spelled out like a bad parody of a letter to Penthouse
magazine. There's a certain Peeping Tomism to even reading this
stuff; one can only imagine how Starr and his team were able to
compile it without questioning how their professional lives had
taken such a turn.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 11 was one of the saddest, strangest and most bizarre days
in the history of this country, as real life once again out-weirded
anything the imagination can conjure. One almost felt as if flags
across the country should be flying at half-mast, out of shame and
humiliation over a president who had disrespected the office and
the people he serves; an independent counsel who ran wild with his
Inspector Javert-like pursuit of the president; and a media
obsessed with sordid scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The madness started early. While congressman debated about the
release of Kenneth Starr's report, Bill Clinton was tearing up as
he addressed a prayer breakfast and apologized yet again for his
reckless affair with the intern Monica Lewinsky and his subsequent
lies about the liaison
</P>
<P>
   All of this, of course, was broadcast on live TV.
</P>
<P>
   At a White House press briefing a few hours later, Mike McCurry
fielded the usual round of embarrassing questions from reporters _
including queries about the president's state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have spoken to the president's physician (and) the president
is not under any medical treatment for any psychiatric or mental
condition,'' said the beleaguered McCurry, who must be dying for
the day when he can finally walk away from his job.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all of that was just pregame filler as we waited for
the release of the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of smut were not disappointed. The report was filled with
excruciatingly detailed allegations about the numerous sexual
encounters between the most powerful individual in the world and
the babbling intern.
</P>
<P>
   Stories of fondling and groping and oral gratification and
stains on dresses. Weirdness with cigars.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton seems like a grabby perv; Lewinsky seems dimwitted and
desperate. The more graphic the description, the less sexy the
scene. Forget about presidential politics and moral debates, and
think for a moment about a 50ish man and a very young woman, going
after each other like a couple of rabid minks while their
colleagues are working just yards away, on the other side of the
locked door. Kinda pathetic, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   The report also confirms the stories about gift-giving. Lewinsky
gave Clinton a half-dozen neckties, a silver cigar holder,
sunglasses, a shirt, a coffee mug, a frog figurine, a letter
opener, an antique paperweight and several books. Clinton gave
Lewinsky brooches, a hat pin, a blanket, a copy of Walt Whitman's
``Leaves of Grass,'' a marble bear figurine.
</P>
<P>
   You read that and you think, Good Lord, they might have been in
love _ or at least in the throes of a heavy mutual crush. Somehow
that's even more disturbing than a relationship based solely on
cheap sex.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing I read in Starr's report _ not a single sentence _
changed my mind about this witch-hunt. It was a horrible waste of
time, effort and money, and I can't imagine this report leading to
impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   If it does, I'm moving to Canada and I'm taking all the sane
people with me.

MARKETING STABLE RETURNS TO IRA HOLDERS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ohio, Minn., Calif.)   (af)  
 By ABBY SCHULTZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is it plain old luck or smart market timing? As stocks continue
to whipsaw their way through the summer, several mutual fund
companies are lining up to sell so-called stable-value funds to
holders of individual retirement accounts, the first time these
super-safe funds have been offered to such investors.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust is set to be first out of the gate this week, with
its BT Preservation Plus Income fund, after gaining Securities and
Exchange Commission approval on Aug. 12. Awaiting approval for
similar funds are Dreyfus, a unit of Mellon Bank, and Morley
Financial Services, a subsidiary of Nationwide Financial Services
of Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, only individuals in 401(k) and similar retirement
plans could invest in stable-value funds, which guarantee investors
a constant net asset value of $1 a share _ just as money market
funds do.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, stable-value funds yield 6.5 percent or so, about 1.5
percentage points more than many money market funds, according to
Kelli Hustad Hueler, president of Hueler Companies, a research firm
in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Such funds hold top-quality, two-to-three-year government,
agency and corporate bonds whose book value _ the purchase price of
the bond plus accrued interest _ is guaranteed by contracts with
insurers and banks. The yields on stable-value funds derive from
the performance on the underlying bonds and vary based on what the
managers buy.
</P>
<P>
   Such funds are, in large part, a successor to the old-fashioned
Guaranteed Investment Contract, or GIC, option once widely
available in many 401(k)s. GICs are a guarantee to pay a fixed rate
of interest by an insurer to investors, but there are no underlying
securities. As such they increasingly fell out of favor starting in
the late 1980s, when some insurers faced big losses from their real
estate and junk-bond holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Financial advisers say many investors are wont to invest too
much of their retirement pot in low-return, conservative
investments. So while it may make sense for them to substitute part
of their money market holdings with a stable-value fund, it is not
seen as a substitute for stocks, which have shown far better
long-term performance.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, are these funds being rolled out just as some nervous
investors are starting to shift from stocks to money market funds
or bank certificates of deposit?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very coincidental,'' Ms. Hueler said. ``We have tried for
so long to get people to educate investors about stable value. But
until this market turns and people feel frightened, nobody wants to
pay attention to safe, secure, boring stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust, for one, hopes to capture dollars rolled out of
401(k) plans when investors retire or change jobs, as well as some
of the $300 billion in IRA money invested in lower-yielding
investments, said Eric Kirsch, chief investment officer of the
bank's structured fixed-income group.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust applied to introduce its fund in mid-June, before
global markets erupted in turmoil, but the bank stands to benefit
as investors reassess their portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that at some point in the cycle there would be an
equity correction and people would address their equity
allocation,'' Kirsch said. ``The situation as it stands is
timely.''
</P>
<P>
   Other money managers aren't standing still, either. Galliard
Capital Management, a subsidiary of the Norwest Corp. that manages
$4.3 billion in assets, $2.6 billion of which is in stable-value
funds, is ``actively considering'' registering a fund for IRA
investors, said Karl Tourville, a managing partner.
</P>
<P>
   And Oppenheimer Funds applied in early June to offer a
stable-value fund to other types of qualified retirement plans
aside from 401(k)s, but the fund will not be open to IRA investors,
according to the filing. Officials at Dreyfus, Morley Financial and
Oppenheimer would not comment on the pending applications, citing
SEC regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the stable-value fund concept to IRA investors proved a
little trickier than just creating a stable-value mutual fund,
Kirsch said. That is because institutions that agree to maintain
the book value of the underlying bonds need assurance that
investors will not flip in and out of the fund to take advantage of
shifting rates.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors of 401(k)-style plans can forbid investors from moving
their money from a stable-value fund to a money market fund if
rates spike, but the SEC will not allow that kind of restriction in
a retail mutual fund, Kirsch said.
</P>
<P>
   To get around the problem, Bankers Trust will charge a
redemption fee of 2 percent and a sales charge of 1 percent on
certain withdrawals when interest rates on a Lehman Brothers
short-term bond index exceed the yield on the fund by more than one
percentage point _ a situation that should rarely occur.
</P>
<P>
   But investors who are age 59{ or older, are on disability or
meet other Internal Revenue Service criteria can remove their money
at any time.
</P>
<P>
   The queasiness of insurance providers over investor behavior is
the reason stable-value funds are not available to taxable retail
investors, who are prone to shift money quickly. But for now,
companies offering stable-value investments are anxious to tap the
$1.6 trillion IRA market, particularly as 401(k) investors retire
and roll their money into IRAs.
</P>
<P>
   According to Spectrem Group, a research firm based in San
Francisco, about 18 percent of $985 billion in 401(k) plans was in
stable-value investments at the end of last year, down from 31
percent of $345 billion at the end of 1992.

   Oaks are a largely tropical and subtropical group of trees and
shrubs native to the Northern Hemisphere, including all of the 48
contiguous states except Idaho (although oaks planted in that
mountainous state are perfectly content). The genus is
extraordinarily diverse, with species that thrive where the
temperature falls far below freezing, as well as in deserts, by the
sea and in the mountains, in sandy soil or in clay.
</P>
<P>
   Oaks are still evolving rapidly, and the natural genetic
variations are notoriously baffling.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take a bur oak from Ohio, from North Dakota and from
South Texas, it will look like three different species,'' said Guy
Sternberg, an authority on the enormous genus Quercus. ``Every tree
is an individual, almost like humans. It makes it very
interesting.'' Some experts say there are as many as 600 clearly
distinct species of oaks, besides innumerable hybrids, which can
occur in anyone's backyard.
</P>
<P>
   Sternberg, 50, was just a young sprout himself when he planted
his first acorn, which he had picked up on a Chicago sidewalk.
There's a parking lot now where his first oak tree grew, but he has
since planted quite a few others to replace it. He has several
hundred species and varieties of oaks at his private 25-acre
arboretum, Starhill Forest, in Petersburg, Ill., north of
Springfield, and he travels around the world to study oaks in their
native habitats.
</P>
<P>
   Sternberg, who works for the Illinois Conservation Department,
is the president of the International Oak Society. For 10 years he
has been writing a substantial reference book on oaks, tentatively
titled ``Oaks of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the greatest American oaks, the Wye Oak, at Wye Mills
State Park on Maryland's Eastern Shore, is thought to be 400 years
old. It is a white oak (Quercus alba), 80 or 90 feet tall, and its
canopy is 100 feet across. Not every oak is as mighty as all that,
but they all produce acorns; a single tree may bear several million
nuts in its long life. Squirrels get a lot of them, and deer and
turkeys also like acorns.
</P>
<P>
   Squirrels are no fools, and they plant oaks assiduously _ so do
blue jays _ but they are not very sensible about where they plant
them, seeming to favor well-prepared ground among my roses and
perennials, where oak saplings cannot be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   Children also plant many noble oaks. A pocketful of acorns, with
their perfectly fitted caps, is a fine thing in itself. Even better
is the plant kingdom's provision for the next generation, an oak
shoot culled from a garden bed, with a pair of soft, vigorous
leaves on its slim but already woody stem _ a long, stout root and
the blackened husk of the acorn seeming to hold them together.
Children enjoy the notion of growing up with young trees, once they
catch on, and perhaps all the more the older they get.
</P>
<P>
   Kings have planted many an oak, too. In the days of wooden
ships, oak, which is tremendously strong, was of huge importance.
In maritime Europe, after centuries of clearing, great forests of
oak had to be planted to supply shipyards. In England, shipwrights
liked to work with gnarled common oaks (Q. robur), and the slender
branches of young trees were sometimes braced into curves and
angles and left to grow into the massy shapes of structural
elements for ships that would not be built for 50 or 100 years
more.
</P>
<P>
   In France, forests of tall, straight durmast oaks (Q. petraea)
were planted for the navy.
</P>
<P>
   The frigate Constitution, whose keel was laid in Boston in 1794,
was clad with Southern live oak: it is not for nothing that it was
called Old Ironsides.
</P>
<P>
   All along the Gulf Coast and the southern Atlantic coast, the
live oak (Q. virginiana) spreads its long, twisting branches _
carpeted with tiny ferns and draped with Spanish moss _ over the
boulevards and bayous.
</P>
<P>
   In the Midwest, where I live, we have taller, straighter oaks,
possibly along the lines of those Keats had in mind when he wrote
in ``Hyperion'' of ``green-rob'd senators of mighty woods.'' Pin
oaks (Q. palustris) are very common here, but nobody knows how they
should really look, with wide skirts sweeping to the ground. City
work crews trim the lower limbs along the street, and homeowners
trim them up, too, more interested in shady lawns than in shade
trees.
</P>
<P>
   People are always chopping at their trees, trying to make them
conform to some excessively neat notion of how a tree should look.
My husband and I have an enormous but slightly shabby old pin-oak
hybrid in the backyard, and every telephone lineman who climbs the
pole at that corner of the property takes a gratuitous hack at it
if we're not careful.
</P>
<P>
   An arborist friend declared it ``somnolescent,'' but it seems to
us that our oak, even if it is getting a little sleepy, is still
flourishing here in the city that has grown up around it. It is big
enough to shade four houses for several hours every day, which
helps keep the electricity bills down. The soil under it is
practically springy because it is full of decaying organic matter,
and a lot of epimediums, hellebores, brunneras and other
shade-loving plants are inordinately happy there.
</P>
<P>
   One dark day, Sternberg assures me, when the old tree comes
down, one of the seedlings we haven't got to yet will suddenly come
into its own and shoot up elsewhere in the yard, throwing all my
planting schemes into disarray. I doubt that I'll be around to
worry about it.

   Shoppers at the four Jordan's Furniture stores in Massachusetts
and New Hampshire might be excused if they sense a hint of bubble
gum in the children's room displays, or a whisper of pine in the
country-style section.
</P>
<P>
   It's not their imagination. Those fragrances are indeed wafting
through those areas, part of an attempt by Jordan's to enlist the
olfactory into making a sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to appeal to all five senses in our displays,'' said
Jan Hedrick, design director at Jordan's, which is based in Acton,
Mass. ``It makes the environment more interesting and makes people
linger longer in the room, which makes them more likely to make a
purchase.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hedrick said sales have increased substantially since the
chain incorporated scent into its retail marketing five years ago.
And while she acknowledged that ``it's impossible to pinpoint
exactly how much of that is due to fragrance,'' Jordan's sells $900
of merchandise a square foot, compared with an industry average of
$150 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidence? Perhaps. Buying decisions are based on many
factors, and a scent is, by definition, an intangible.
</P>
<P>
   But businesses are increasingly regarding ``environmental
fragrancing'' as a key design element, as important as lighting,
layout and background music. And traditional retailers in
particular are looking for ways to make the store experience
different from that of mail-order houses and Internet merchants.
</P>
<P>
   The Christmas store at Disney World, which is open year-round,
is infused with the scents of evergreen and spiced apple cider.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to conjure Christmas and the desire to do
Christmas shopping in Florida in July,'' said David Martin, vice
president of manufacturing at Fragrance Technologies, a company in
Orlando, Fla., that outfitted the store.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of those scents, he said, the store ``smells like
Christmas. It really gets you in the mood.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rainforest Cafe chain of 17 restaurants pumps fresh-flower
extracts into its retail sections. ``The scent opens your mind,''
said Steven W. Schussler, senior vice president of development at
the company, which is based in Minneapolis. ``It makes you curious
and makes you more likely to spend money. Call it a subliminal
awakening.''
</P>
<P>
   Fragrances may be one of the oldest marketing techniques _ since
ancient times, merchants have burned incense to draw a crowd. Walk
past street vendors in Times Square and smell how the tradition
continues today.
</P>
<P>
   But for more subtle, nuanced approaches, only in the last 10
years has research focused on the effect of fragrances on moods and
behavior. Studies in neurological, psychiatric and business
management journals have shown that, like soft lighting and
soothing music, pleasant smells can indeed have an influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interest has been ramping up with the popularity of
aromatherapy,'' said Avery N. Gilbert, the scientific affairs
director of the Olfactory Research Fund in New York, a division of
the Fragrance Foundation, the industry's trade association.
Aromatherapy, a type of alternative medicine, prescribes smelling
herbs and essential oils to remedy various mental and physical
disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, new technologies analyze scents on a molecular level
easily and cheaply, letting a growing industry of fragrance makers
reproduce and sell them to businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of odors is thought to be more intense than auditory
or visual stimuli because olfactory nerves connect directly to the
area of the brain that is responsible for feelings and memory.
</P>
<P>
   Research subjects who catch an appealing whiff of something like
flowers, vanilla or cinnamon have tended to be more cooperative in
negotiations and perform better on cognitive tasks _ one reason
that more corporations are installing fragrance systems at their
work sites in an effort to improve productivity.
</P>
<P>
   But retailers have focused on research showing that people
evaluate merchandise more positively _ and spend more time shopping
_ when an agreeable odor is present.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pleasant fragrances put you in a better mood,'' said Robert A.
Baron, a professor of management and psychology at Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., who studies workplace and
retail environments.
</P>
<P>
   In one study, a fruity-floral scent introduced into a jewelry
store was shown to increase lingering time. In another, people
exposed to pleasant smells _ coffee roasting, cookies baking _ in
one area of a shopping mall reported being in a better mood than
those in fragrance-free areas.
</P>
<P>
   They were also more likely to give a stranger change for a
dollar and return dropped pens. The inference is that good smells
make shoppers happier, more cooperative and, thus, more likely to
buy.
</P>
<P>
   Though the average person finds thousands of scents agreeable,
selecting just the right one can be tricky. Not surprisingly,
research shows that incongruent scents tend to decrease shoppers'
interest.
</P>
<P>
   That's probably why Victoria's Secret does not smell like pot
roast _ its stores are infused with the feminine scents the chain
sells. ``Fragrances should be an extension of corporate image,''
Gilbert said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Thomas Pink Inc., a London-based shirt maker that
recently opened a store in Manhattan, fills its shops with the
smell of ``line-dried linen,'' said Robert F. Wood, director of the
company's United States operations. ``It's a very clean and crisp
scent,'' he said, evoking ``our product and its quality.''

REVENGE THREATENED AFTER ISRAELI ARMY KILLS 2 HAMAS OPERATIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Islamic militants vowed Friday to avenge with
bloodshed the Israeli army's killing of two of their key operatives
Thursday, threatening a new wave of violence after a year of
refraining from deadly attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Wary of reprisals, Israel put its troops on high alert and
sealed its borders with the West Bank and Gaza. Palestinians fired
at an Israeli bus carrying Jewish settlers to Nablus, and Israeli
police fired rubber bullets into a crowd of rock-throwing youths at
a West Bank blockade. But as of late Friday night, no serious
injuries had been reported.
</P>
<P>
   At a small house on a hilltop outside Hebron, Israeli army
officials displayed what they said was evidence that gunning down
the two men, who were brothers, had thwarted an imminent terrorist
attack by Hamas, the Islamic militant movement.
</P>
<P>
   Laid out on a Palestinian headscarf in the dusty yard, the
evidence consisted of nine grenades, two automatic weapons, two
pistols, bullets and five wigs _ one blond.
</P>
<P>
   Taped up neatly inside the house was a clean white sheet
emblazoned with the Arabic name of Hamas' military wing amid upheld
fists and weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers, Imad and Adel Awadallah, have long been wanted by
both Israeli and Palestinian officials. But, according to an
Israeli army commander, Brig. Gen. Yitzik Eitan, troops stumbled
upon them by chance. Explosions and gunfire in the craggy hills
drew them to the squat building, the commander said, and a
three-day surveillance led them to raid what they believed was a
safehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said about 100 troops stormed the house, the summer
cottage of a Hebron food merchant. They killed the men before they
had a chance to reach for their weapons, the army commander said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the troops had given the brothers a chance to surrender
first, Gen. Eitan said, ``What do you want me to do? Knock on the
door? When you fight terrorists, it's very difficult to warn
them.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only after they were dead that the brothers were
identified, the commander said.
</P>
<P>
   Adel Awadallah, 33, was considered to have been an engineer of
several terrorist attacks, including the deadly suicide bombing on
the Ben Yehuda pedestrian mall in Jerusalem in 1997. He had been a
fugitive for four years.
</P>
<P>
   His younger brother, Imad, 31, had been a fugitive since last
month when he escaped from solitary confinement in a Palestinian
jail, where he was being held as a suspect in the killing of
another key Hamas operative, a bombmaker named Muhyideen al-Sharif.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Imad Awadallah's jailing had inflamed tensions between Hamas and
the Palestinian Authority, and within the Authority. Some believed
there was insufficient evidence to hold him. Hamas said it
suspected that the bombmaker had really been killed by the
Palestinian Authority in collusion with the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   At the Awadallah home at the edge of an industrial zone in
al-Birah, a third brother, Amar, said Thursday that his brothers
had expected to die ``on the road of Jihad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They were expecting to be martyrs and they got what they were
dreaming of,'' he said. ``Now they will go to heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the killings, many Israelis said they felt
unsettled, fearing a reprise of the suicide bombings that followed
the first slaying of a Hamas mastermind in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   And the killings stirred anew the frustration and anger of many
Palestinians. ``We were against Hamas in the beginning,'' said
Suhaila Qaqur, 48, who sat under a tarp in a field of grapevines
outside Hebron. ``But if the Israelis are assassinating people,
then maybe Hamas is right about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Her brother, Nezam Qaqur, clucked his tongue. ``No, no, enough
blood,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was an edgy backdrop for the U.S. envoy to the Middle East,
Dennis Ross, who has been trying to break the deadlock in peace
negotiations this week with posters plastered here and in Tel Aviv
saying, ``Dennis Ross, Go Home.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Palestinian official, Ahmed Abdel-Rachman, suggested
that the Israelis had timed the raid to undermine Ross.
</P>
<P>
   In Gaza City, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, who is paralyzed, was wheeled
into the town square to address a rally of hundreds who gathered
after the midday prayers. When he arrived, his supporters chanted,
``Revenge, revenge, our sheik will get revenge.''

CHECK OUT THESE BIRDS: THEY'RE NOT WINKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<TEXT>
<P>
   When is a pink lawn flamingo just a pink lawn flamingo?
</P>
<P>
   When is it a simple decorative prop spearing the front lawn and
when is it an ironic statement about culture or _ when you stop to
think about it _ a rather nasty declaration of one's superior class
status?
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Susan Sontag defined camp as something that's ``good
because it's awful,'' more than 30 years ago, social historians and
cultural observers have been debating the meaning of kitsch and
camp _ as an esthetic sensibility in its own right, as a commentary
on popular taste and culture, as a sign of snooty class elitism, as
a symbol of outlaw culture.
</P>
<P>
   Yet now, as kitsch's tacky loudness has become mainstream,
cultural observers are wondering just how meaningful it can be in
any of these areas.
</P>
<P>
   Kitsch, a German word for smear or junk, is basically any type
of art, writing or objects designed to have popular appeal. It is
the collectible debris of mass-market culture, says Celeste
Olalquiaga, a cultural historian whose book ``The Artificial
Kingdom: A Treasury of the Kitsch Experience'' is being published
by Pantheon in November. Call it the Pee-wee's Playhouse esthetic.
Chia pets, lava lamps, busts of Elvis, fuzzy dice, Bionic Man lunch
boxes, pink flamingos, platform shoes, double-knit polyester pant
suits, hermit-crab key rings, Donny and Marie, drag queens, mood
rings, Hawaiiana.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Olalquiaga says kitsch's roots lie in the Victorian era,
when mass production and mass consumption first roared to life. The
Victorian obsession with miniatures, travel souvenirs and
mass-produced memorabilia, along with the rise of what she views as
the prototype for the contemporary shopping mall _ Paris'
glass-covered passageways and London's 1851 Crystal Palace _ gave
birth to kitsch.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, as people began to live longer lives and the
industrial revolution provided some glimpse of the future, Ms.
Olalquiaga said, objects that signified past events became
meaningful. Past events became sweet sentimental memories
inextricably linked to a person's own longevity. Kitsch represented
for the first time the chance for an entire culture to bond
together in sentimentalism.
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Sontag's 1964 essay ``Notes on Camp,'' she divided the
subject into two categories: naive camp (because of your upbringing
and cultural background and class, you like the pink lawn flamingo
and consider it an object of some value) and deliberate camp (by
displaying the pink flamingo as an ironic commentary, you establish
yourself as a sophisticated, tongue-in-cheek cultural observer).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Olalquiaga, however, believes that kitsch and camp were
merely gestating in the 1960s and 1970s, when popular culture and
well-marketed fads like Sea Monkeys and hermit crabs met at a
consumer crossroads. She says it was not until the 1980s that
Americans _ in the flushed heat of a roaring stock market, a
bullish actor-president and sharpening class differences _ looked
back at those objects with an ironic eye and used them as symbols
of and jokes about class, taste and culture.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the '80s, however, as the obvious irony of camp
was embraced by a large, mainstream audience, some critics say,
kitsch no longer critiqued middle-class tastes or marked class
distinctions. Kitsch's power as social commentary was diluted.
</P>
<P>
   Jane and Michael Stern _ authors of such pop-culture tomes as
``The Encyclopedia of Bad Taste,'' ``The Encyclopedia of Pop
Culture,'' ``Square Meals'' (a celebration of American food like
tuna-noodle casserole and the Hostess Twinkie) _ say that kitsch
has been so absorbed by American culture that it has lost its
wink-wink irony.
</P>
<P>
   ``What made it relevant to culture observers was that other
culture observers were watching it,'' Ms. Stern said. ``Part of the
problem is that everything is cyclical, and the first time
something comes around it's funny, and the second time it comes
around it's culturally relevant and the third time it comes around
it's just boring.``
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stern cited the films of director and writer John Waters and
the stores like Manhattan's Little Ricky _ which has sold Elvis
tapestries, lawn flamingos and rhinestone-studded clocks in the
shape of winking cat figurines _ as barometers of the growing
popularity and thus the waning cultural value of kitsch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael and I travel all over America, and there's still
plenty of dreck out there, but somehow it has lost its charm to the
witty, erudite people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Stern said: ``There is so much kitsch and bad taste and
vulgarity all around us that it is no longer fun, no longer
recognizable as anything campy or kitschy. Most mainstream
magazines, television shows and Hollywood movies now wallow in the
kind of bad taste that was once reserved for outlaw culture. For
example, the cheesecake peekaboo magazines that used to cover
peripheral sexual issues have evaporated, and now the national
magazines cover those issues.''
</P>
<P>
   But to Mary Mothersill, a professor emeritus of philosophy at
Barnard College who studies esthetics, this critique reflects a
kind of class contempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Sterns argue is that all of this material delineate
class,'' said Ms. Mothersill, who has lectured on the notion of bad
taste. ``And it's rather crude. Some people love their doilies and
flamingos.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, when people like the Sterns like kitsch, it's
meaningful, but when people from a lower social class do, it's
vulgar.
</P>
<P>
   Glasgow Phillips, author of the title essay of the book ``Shiny
Adidas Tracksuits and the Death of Camp,''(Berkley
Boulevard/Penguin Putnam, 1998) says that the power of camp to
delineate class has finally been lost.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that it was a clear class barometer,'' Phillips
said. ``But take this example. You can make a really blunt
statement of `I'm rich' by wearing a big gold necklace with a big
fat Donald Trump-size diamond in it. But everyone who's in on the
joke knows that's tacky and that making an admission of being rich
isn't part of what being in the upper middle class is all about. So
then you get someone more sophisticated who says, `I'm in on the
joke, and therefore I can make fun of the other classes by wearing
the big tacky fat gold necklace. I'm part of the group that knows
better.' But it's an endless cycle now, and it has become harder
and harder to decode.''
</P>
<P>
   John Waters _ auteur of such proto-camp film classics as ``Pink
Flamingos'' and ``Hairspray,'' said, ``Whatever was camp has
mutated into plain mainstream American humor . . . Kitsch, or camp,
means something so bad it's good. But what is so bad it's good
anymore?''
</P>
<P>
   In the post-Pee-wee era, when drag queens are no longer shocking
and the perimeters of outlaw art no longer include kitsch, some
critics think that it is now reverting to its original mission: a
popular, mass-marketed culture that is earnestly adored by
Americans. Maybe it's time to start calling a pink flamingo a pink
flamingo again.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Olalquiaga, who was born in Chile and reared in Venezuela,
contends that Americans continue to have a fondness, ironic or not,
for collectible knickknacks. And she says that she is honestly
fascinated by plastic flowers. (She is what Ms. Sontag might call a
deliberate naif.)
</P>
<P>
   And kitsch's influence, she argues, has continued to reach into
every corner of American life, from television sitcoms to interior
decorating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie `Titanic' for me was kitsch,'' she said. ``You only
need a sentimental disposition to enjoy it. We live in a period of
pastiche and recycling _ it doesn't matter whether that's lava
lamps or stories about the Titanic _ and those are the primary
elements of kitsch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may grow tired of a lava lamp. But your little sister or
your children may not. Kitsch is never going to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Olalquiaga, who spends her spare time combing New York City
flea markets and thrift stores for paint-by-numbers paintings and
plastic flowers, added, ``I propose that it is an eternal American
cultural sensibility and cultural esthetic.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a telling example of what cultural plane kitsch exists
on today is RuPaul, the platinum blond drag queen performer, talk
show host and high priestess of camp and kitsch. He poses in a new
print ad for Rockport shoes, known for their sensible comfort and
durability. With no makeup, he is wearing jeans and Rockports as
any normal-looking, blandly handsome bald man might.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a dark day for the fate of kitsch when one of the great
kitsch heroes doffs his kitschiness in favor of quotidian
minimalist civvies?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a word for it,'' said RuPaul's manager, Randy Barbato.
``It's so kitsch, it's post-kitsch.''

BC RIDES GEORGIA TECH WIN INTO BIG EAST OPENER 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON _ After kicking off its 100th football season with an
impressive 41-31 victory at Georgia Tech last week, Boston College
returns home as an overwhelming favorite to win its Big East opener
against Rutgers Saturday at Alumni Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   If the divergent numbers the Eagles and the Scarlet Knights
posted in their season-opening triumphs are any indication, BC _
favored by at least three touchdowns _ could be in for another
celebration in Game 2 of its centennial season.
</P>
<P>
   However, the only numbers that concern coach Tom O'Brien are 2
and 0. That is what O'Brien hopes his record will be after the noon
game against lowly Rutgers, which snapped a 14-game losing streak
by barely beating Division 1-AA opponent Richmond, 7-6, last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the important thing is that it's the Big East
opener,'' said O'Brien, who this week penned an open letter in BC's
student newspaper, The Heights, beseeching the students for
support. ``The team has a stated goal of winning the Big East
championship. They understand how a loss can hurt in conference
play after last year's loss to Temple (28-21). It's important that
you get off to a good start in your conference. As we learned, it's
a heck of a lot better to be 2-0 than 1-1, like we were a year
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Scarlet Knights managed only 243 yards of total
offense and allowed 274, BC steamrolled the Yellow Jackets,
amassing 491 yards in total offense to 392 (165 rushing).
</P>
<P>
   Fifth-year quarterback Scott Mutryn was sharp, completing 16 of
26 passes for 220 yards and a 15-yard touchdown and rushing for
scores of 3 and 5 yards. Still, he knows there is ample room for
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rate my performance as average,'' said Mutryn. ``I missed
some things early in the game. I missed some passes and I missed
some reads that definitely could've been better. But you have to
get your feet wet somehow. Do I have to improve? Absolutely.
There's definite strides that have to be taken if we want to be a
successful team, and a lot of that has to be taken on our
shoulders. I just have to make sure I go out every week and do my
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Mutryn's job Saturday will be to hand the ball to senior
running back Mike Cloud, who fulfilled the prediction of senior
right guard Dan Collins by rushing for 200 yards (on 34 carries) at
Georgia Tech. This week Cloud said his linemen were making no
predictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to go into the Rutgers game still having that high
from the Georgia Tech game,'' said Cloud, who scored on runs of 1
and 7 yards against the Yellow Jackets. ``But we just have to focus
game by game, and hopefully, we can have just as good a game as we
had against them last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Cloud, who has recorded three of his top 10 career rushing
performances against the Scarlet Knights, led BC to a 35-21 triumph
at Piscataway, N.J., by rushing 35 times for 166 yards and scoring
on runs of 6, 8, and 4 yards. He also made one catch for a 19-yard
TD.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly have a tremendous amount of respect for Mike
Cloud, based on last year's experience,'' said embattled Rutgers
coach Terry Shea, rumored to be on the hot seat after last season's
0-11 debacle was followed up by the lackluster Richmond game.
``Mike Cloud is going to present a tremendous challenge to us
certainly, based upon what Richmond was able to do to us with their
fine running backs.''
</P>
<P>
   To address that situation, Shea shook up his defense _ which he
had already revamped by switching from an eight-man front to a 4-3
scheme _ by making several personnel changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we are concerned,'' Shea said, referring to BC's strong
running attack. ``But we just have to continue to try and be
creative in how we line our guys up and how we respond to the true
running situation.''
</P>
<P>
   To complicate matters, Rutgers's West Coast offense was dealt a
stinging blow during the preseason when it lost two of its top
three wideouts _ Walter King (back) and Delrico Fletcher (foot) _
leaving Bill Powell, who suffered a sprained knee during camp, as
the primary target of sophomore quarterback Mike McMahon.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I've told the team, you've got to respect everybody, but
we're not going to fear anyone,'' O'Brien said. ``We have to take
care of ourselves and make sure we're the best football team we can
be. It has nothing to do with who's favored or not favored or who
you're playing. You want the best effort out of your football team
_ mistake-free, error-free _ and make the other team beat you.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of the primary goals of Paul Kellogg, the general
and artistic director of the New York City Opera, is to give his
company an identity distinct from that of his Lincoln Center
neighbor, the Metropolitan Opera. And however one feels about the
City Opera's new production of Puccini's ``Tosca,'' which opened
the season Thursday night, Kellogg has certainly achieved his goal.
</P>
<P>
   The grim, spare sets designed by Michael Yeargan, and the
production concept of the director Mark Lamos, which updates the
setting to Fascist Rome during the 1930s, could not be more
different from the sumptuously gargantuan realism of the Met's
popular Franco Zeffirelli production.
</P>
<P>
   Another goal of Kellogg, who is also the longtime artistic
director of the Glimmerglass Opera, is to use that summer festival
in Cooperstown to try out productions meant for New York. Here,
too, he has succeeded. The gifted Lamos has eliminated some of the
excesses of this summer's staging to good effect.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the three principal singers were vastly stronger than
their Glimmerglass counterparts. Overall, the production emerged as
a valid and often involving take on a repertory staple.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of setting the opera against events of Napoleon's battle
at Marengo in 1800, the director and his team, including Constance
Hoffman (costumes) and Robert Wierzel (lighting), wanted to convey
the gritty bleakness of the story. So the locked gates to the
chapels in the church look like prison cells, and a huge silver
cross hangs above, more a symbol of oppression than redemption.
</P>
<P>
   Baron Scarpia, the villainous police chief, looks like a
jackbooted generalissimo, emboldened by the cravenly compliant
church. The wealthy, handsome painter Mario is a traitor to his
class, a brash radical openly defiant of the right-wing crackdown.
And the apolitical Tosca is a prima donna in a lacy '30s dress,
who, when she struggles to compose herself after stabbing Scarpia
to death, reaches into her purse for a pocket mirror.
</P>
<P>
   In toning down the steaminess of his staging, Lamos got some of
the kinks out. For sure, Scarpia is a sexual sicko: the more Tosca
detests him, he says, the more it arouses him. But at Glimmerglass,
during the procession in the church at the end of Act I, Lamos had
Scarpia engage in a clearly masturbatory act that was way out of
character. After all, self-control was a rather large component of
Scarpia's makeup.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the chorus sings the ``Te Deum,'' Scarpia slips into a
pew with the other churchgoers, looking vaguely embarrassed by his
orgasmic thoughts, but lost amid the crowd, and oddly human.
</P>
<P>
   Making her company debut as Tosca, the Belgian soprano Isabelle
Kabatu had the requisite dark-toned beauty and emotional
turbulence. Her earthy, throbbing voice sometimes seemed to be
working overly hard to fill out the role, with consequent loss of
vocal radiance. But she was an ardent and often affecting Tosca.
</P>
<P>
   Also making his company debut as Mario was the American tenor
Antonio Nagore, who has husky youthful energy and a bright, ringing
voice. He overindulged in throaty, emotive effects, sacrificing
long line in the effort. When he put his mind to singing with
gentle lyricism, it was quite lovely. In all, this was a most
promising debut. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The American baritone Mark Delavan, who has been so impressive
in previous City Opera performances, seemed not in his best voice.
But he is a remarkable singer with a warm, plush sound and keen
intelligence. His Scarpia was menacing yet elegantly mannered, as
this scheming aristocrat must be.
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra playing of this constantly shifting music was not
always tidy, but George Manahan brought sweep and stylish vitality
to the performance, and the playing should get stronger as the run
continues.

IF THE STUFF DOESN'T WORK, WHY DO THEY TAKE IT?

<P>
   Some food for thought this morning with your creatine pancakes
and your coffee spiced with a touch of andro. From the wonderful
Mrs. comes this question:
</P>
<P>
   ``From everything I read, baseball people say that these things
the players take (strength-enhancing supplements) don't make a
difference. Well, if they don't make a difference, why do they take
them? Why would you take something that doesn't help you?''
</P>
<P>
   Before this Mark McGwire thing began this year, national
magazines had reported on the increased use of
performance-enhancers by baseball players. They named names. One
was former Red Sox outfielder Brady Anderson, one of the first to
use creatine to build size and strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he first came to us,'' says former Red Sox general
manager Lou Gorman, ``he weighed about 175 or 180 pounds. He hit
about four or five homes runs a year.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first five years of pro ball, minor and major leagues,
Anderson averaged five home runs. After he was traded to Baltimore,
he averaged 16 for four years. Then, all of a sudden in 1995, he
hit 50 home runs. By this time, through lifting weights and using
creatine, he had bulked up to more than 200 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's hand-eye coordination _ which baseball types like to
promote as the key to good hitting _ didn't change. But his size
and home run output did.
</P>
<P>
   Of course these enhancers help, or else players wouldn't take
them. According to reports, hundreds of major leaguers use them.
Why not? They are not banned in baseball and they do make you
stronger and, in turn, produce a faster swing that drives the ball
farther.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is a comparison of the home run years of the all-time big
three: McGwire, Babe Ruth, and Roger Maris. McGwire hit his
record-breaking 62 home runs in 610 plate appearances. Almost 150
of those were walks. When he hit 60 in 1927, Ruth had 698 plate
appearances with 138 walks. So Ruth had almost 100 more chances
than McGwire did. Maris had 691 plate appearances when he hit 61 in
1961, and 94 were walks. Thus, McGwire had a lot fewer cracks at
the record than both Ruth and Maris.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Someone who knows Chicago Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf recently
asked him what's going to happen with coach Phil Jackson and
superstar Michael Jordan. Reinsdorf reportedly answered that
Jackson definitely will not be back. He wants to stay out of
basketball for a year. The Chicago owner also said Jordan would
``probably not'' be back with the Bulls this season ... Ex-Patriot
Pat Harlow got torched by the Chiefs' Derrick Thomas for six sacks
last Sunday night in the Raiders' 28-8 loss. Thomas holds the NFL
record for sacks in a game with seven. Who was the offensive tackle
he blew away in that game? ... Gorman says that contrary to radio
reports this week, he never came close to signing McGwire. ``I
heard that report myself and don't know where it came from,'' he
says. ``It never happened. The guy we thought we had was Kirby
Puckett, but he went back to the Twins at the last minute. We
drafted Tino Martinez when he was 17 years old, but his mother
wouldn't let him sign with us. She wanted him to go to college. We
drafted Jack McDowell and gave him a heck of an offer, but he
turned it down for Stanford. Those two guys could have made a big
difference for us over the years.'' ... Terrell Davis didn't look
like the Terrell Davis of old against the Patriots, did he? He
didn't knock anyone over or slice upfield for extra yardage as he
had in the past. Incidentally, the Patriots-Denver game had the
lowest rating _ 14.8 _ of any ``Monday Night Football'' opener
ever.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A year ago at this time, when the ESPN-Chilton poll was taken
asking fans across the country for their favorite professional
athlete, McGwire was nowhere in the top 30. Today he and Brett
Favre of the Packers are tied for second behind Jordan ... Phil
Castinetti, who owns Sports World in Everett, reports that
McGwire's baseball card ``has gone from $10 at the start of the
season to $200 right now. But a baseball signed by Maris is still
going for $1,000 and a McGwire ball is worth around $200. The
difference is that Maris played before the memorabilia craze and
didn't sign that much stuff. His is tougher to get.'' Castinetti is
holding his biggest annual All-Boston Auction until next Friday
night, and his most expensive item is a game jersey of Ted Williams
that could fetch up to $50,000.

   A class act. Walking out of the Buffalo dressing room last
Sunday after a heartbreaking loss in the final minute, Doug Flutie
approached Bills owner Ralph Wilson and told him, ``Mr. Wilson, I
want to thank you for bringing me to Buffalo.'' Wilson thanked
Flutie for coming and thinks he will be a terrific plus for the
Bills. ``He plays with great fire,'' says Wilson. ``The players
respond to him.'' ... Al Pacino is studying Bill Parcells to get
ready for a role as a pro football coach in an Oliver Stone movie.
Pacino spent some time with Parcells at a Jets practice and in his
office and will be back ... Parcells on the Baltimore Ravens, whom
the Jets face Sunday: ``They have eight players on offense who
could start for San Francisco. The only Niners who could start for
Baltimore, in my opinion, are (Jerry) Rice, (Steve) Young, and
(Kevin) Gogan.'' ... Joe Gibbs expects the NASCAR craze to push the
expanded racetrack in Loudon, N.H., over 100,000 capacity in the
next few years and eventually up to 120,000 ... Jerry Jacobs, the
Bruins owner who bid on the Cleveland Browns, says his financial
analysis of the NFL expansion franchise indicated that it would
take 18 years to pay for the team if it were purchased for $400
million. Al Lerner bought the Browns for $530 million, and when
Jacobs was asked how long it would take to pay that off, he
answered, ``Never.'' ... There is no way the Broncos would have
worked over Jimmy Hitchcock like they did Chris Canty Monday.
Ex-Patriot Hitchcock had six tackles and an interception in his
debut for Minnesota Sunday. Canty will be on the bench as soon as
Tebucky Jones or Steve Isreal is ready to play ... Answer to sack
question: Andy Heck, then of Seattle, now of the Bears.

IN LANDMARK SETTLEMENT, A QUESTION OF FEES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., N.Y., Mass., Pa., Ala.)   (af)  
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four years ago, some enterprising class-action lawyers filed a
novel antitrust case accusing more than three dozen Wall Street
brokerage houses of illegally fixing prices on stocks traded on the
NASDAQ market. By last spring, against long odds, the lawyers had
won settlements of more than $1 billion from the brokers, the
largest such amount in antitrust history, and had helped push
NASDAQ into a radical overhaul of its trading practices.
</P>
<P>
   Now, those lawyers would like their fee. Is that too much to
ask? More specifically, is $174,823,124 too much to ask?
</P>
<P>
   The answer _ resting in the hands of Judge Robert W. Sweet of
federal district court in Manhattan _ will not only determine how
much NASDAQ investors will recover in this landmark case, but could
also affect future legal fees in a venue that handles some of the
nation's most important securities cases.
</P>
<P>
   That is perhaps why there was not an empty seat in Sweet's
expansive 18th-floor courtroom on Wednesday, when the lawyers
officially asked him to approve the settlement and the fee request,
which were defended by some illustrious class-action critics and
criticized by lawyers claiming to speak for the case's
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The objectors included Lawrence Schonbrun, a lawyer from
Berkeley, Calif., whose practice consists largely of objecting to
the fees sought by other lawyers in high-profile cases. He was
joined by Robert L. Weinberg, a retired partner of Williams &AMP;
Connolly in Washington, and by several other lawyers and investors.
</P>
<P>
   The defenders, surprisingly, included John C. Coffee Jr., a
Columbia University law professor who is a stern critic of
class-action lawyers. He was joined by Arthur R. Miller, a Harvard
law professor, and by three other notable academics who all deemed
the fees more than reasonable given extraordinary obstacles the
case faced when it was filed in May 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The fees are being sought by the lawyers who led the vast legal
team: Arthur M. Kaplan of Fine, Kaplan &AMP; Black in Philadelphia;
Leonard B. Simon of Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &AMP; Lerach in San
Diego, and Christopher Lovell of Lovell &AMP; Stewart and Robert A.
Skirnick of Meredith Cohen Greenfogel &AMP; Skirnick, both in New York.
</P>
<P>
   With lawyers from some of the 65 other firms that worked on the
case filling the sunny courtroom, Skirnick had the happy task of
defending the proposed settlement _ which was described as ``record
breaking'' a record-breaking number of times. Not only was the
settlement huge, it was all in cash _ ``no coupons, no
contingencies, no return of money to the defendants, no matter
what,'' Skirnick boasted.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, the pioneering lawsuit had prodded both the
Justice Department's antitrust division and the Securities and
Exchange Commission to undertake their own investigations of the
NASDAQ market, which in turn prompted changes that have made the
stock market, the nation's second-largest, a fairer place for
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Given the difficulties and risks of submitting their untested
legal theories to a jury, he continued, ``this is an outstanding,
an extraordinary, a `never before in the history of' settlement''
that should be approved.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg, the retired lawyer, was less impressed. Institutional
investors, by far the most active NASDAQ traders, are expected to
get up to 70 percent of the settlement, he said. That could leave
just $250 million to be divided among millions of individual
investors, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   But the sharpest arguments focused on how, and how much, the
legal team should be paid.
</P>
<P>
   Class-action lawyers are sometimes awarded fees based on the
number of hours they worked, multiplied by some numerical figure
reflecting the difficulty of the case and the quality of the
result.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, said Simon of Milberg Weiss, more than 380 lawyers
and 235 paralegals spent nearly 130,000 hours over the last four
years reviewing 3 million pages of documents, 10,000 hours of
audiotape and more than 200 interview transcripts. Their hourly
bills alone come to more than $36.2 million. Given the excellent
results, he continued, it theoretically would be reasonable to
quintuple that hourly total.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the NASDAQ case, however, the lawyers are not seeking hourly
fees but instead are requesting a percentage of the total recovery.
That approach, while increasingly common elsewhere, has not been
officially endorsed in the busy federal court district that
encompasses Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, they are seeking 17.5 percent, considerably less
than the 25 to 30 percent that is typical for smaller class-action
recoveries.
</P>
<P>
   But because of the settlement's remarkable size, that would
yield a fee of about $175 million if it were paid immediately. (The
amount rises as the settlement fund earns interest.) In addition,
the lawyers are seeking $4.4 million in out-of-pocket expenses,
which brings the total fee request to about 18 percent of the
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   These guys earned every nickel, argued Coffee in an affidavit
submitted to the court and cited frequently during the hearing.
Though he has ``often been critical of the performance of
class-action plaintiff's attorneys,'' he added, this case is an
exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there are many `poster boys' for what is wrong with the
class action today,'' he concluded, ``this is essentially a story
of what is right with the class action.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, in his own affidavit, agreed. ``This is not a case in
which any knowledgeable observer, at the outset, would have
anticipated such a favorable result,'' he wrote, noting that the
firms had invested heavily in a case that seemed likely to be
dismissed at any moment.
</P>
<P>
   Even Schonbrun, the critic from Berkeley, complimented the legal
team's work. ``But to say that $180 million in attorneys' fees is
excessive is not to denigrate these attorneys,'' he told the court.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he said, no fee should be awarded until the bills have
been scrutinized by a court-appointed figure _ perhaps himself _
who could ``come to the defense'' of the affected investors.
Moreover, he argued that the fee percentage should shrink as the
size of recovery grows and that the fee here should be no more than
10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Make that 3 percent, suggested another objector, Edward M. Selfe
of Bradley Arant Rose &AMP; White in Birmingham, Ala., who argued that
the lawyers were exaggerating their contributions to the case.
</P>
<P>
   In Coffee's view, however, shrinking the fee as the settlement
grows punishes lawyers for getting the maximum recovery for the
members of the class and encourages them to settle early for a
smaller amount _ precisely what he has so often criticized them
for.
</P>
<P>
   Simon of Milberg Weiss pointed out that not a single
institutional investor, state attorney general or public interest
advocate had objected to the fees. ``The people with the most at
stake, with the most sophistication, are not here,'' he said.
``We've not had a peep out of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Sweet announced that he would reserve his decision to
some future date, he listened with a bemused smile to Edward H.
Sonn, an investor from Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Sonn did not object to the lawyers' receiving $175 million in
fees; he did, however, object to millions of NASDAQ investors'
receiving the remaining $850 million. Since the resulting payments
would be ``insignificant'' for most investors, he said, ``is it
possible to allocate the fund in trust for distribution to
charity?'' That amount, he added, ``would do an awful lot of good
in this world.''
</P>
<P>
   No one in the crowded courtroom rose to endorse his suggestion.

   WASHINGTON _ With tears in his eyes, President Clinton on Friday
morning told a roomful of clergy that he had sinned. He spoke just
hours before the world was presented with a painstaking account by
prosecutors of when, where, and how.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing a prayer breakfast at the White House, Clinton drew
on the New Testament, the Yom Kippur liturgy and Ernest Hemingway
as he made his most abject confession yet of personal failure,
while declaring he would defend and redeem his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is a fancy way to say that I have
sinned,'' Clinton admitted softly, saying that after resisting
expressions of contrition he had reached ``the rock-bottom truth of
where I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton asked for forgiveness for the first time from Monica
Lewinsky, on the day that the details of their intimate
relationship _ details that he had denied and struggled to suppress
_ poured out through the Internet, whose wonders as a tool of
communication he has so often extolled.
</P>
<P>
   In the company of clergy and to a rolling refrain of Scripture,
the president spent a solemn day in public with his wife, Hillary
Rodham Clinton. He spoke at the annual prayer breakfast Friday
morning, and then went to the National Cathedral at midday to
address a memorial service for the victims of twin bombings at
embassies in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Under cloudless skies late Friday afternoon, he received the
Paul O'Dwyer Freedom and Justice award in a ceremony on the South
Lawn of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Apology aside, it was a fundamentally normal presidential
schedule, on one of the strangest days in the history of the
presidency. The Clintons, two fierce political fighters, had
finally and utterly lost perhaps their most bitterly fought battle,
to maintain what Mrs. Clinton has often called a ``zone of
privacy'' for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an unusual, and I think unusually important, day
today,'' the president said in his remarks to the clergy Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton expressed gratitude to those who thought ``the bounds of
privacy have been excessively and unwisely invaded,'' but added,
``in this case, it may be a blessing, because I still sinned. And
if my repentance is genuine and sustained and if I can maintain
both a broken spirit and a strong heart, then good can come of this
for our country as well as for me and my family.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that his experience could teach children that
``integrity is important and selfishness is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 10-minute remarks, Clinton tried to walk a line between
abject contrition and the fierce determination to fight that he has
expressed privately to friends. ``I will instruct my lawyers to
mount a vigorous defense, using all available appropriate legal
arguments,'' he said, ``but legal language must not obscure the
fact that I have done wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Clinton's lawyers later released a 73-page defense of
his actions before they had read the report by Kenneth Starr, the
independent prosecutor. Starr and Congress rebuffed White House
requests for an advance look at the report.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not always seem grim in public on Friday. As he
arrived at the memorial service, about 12 minutes late, he turned
around in his straight-backed chair to exchange a laugh with Donna
Shalala, the secretary of health and human services.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting Clinton called to apologize to his Cabinet on
Thursday, Shalala challenged an argument he made that presidents
should be judged by their policies in public, not their behavior in
private. ``Mr. President, surely you don't believe that,'' she
said, according to a person familiar with the exchange. Clinton did
not back down an inch, this person said.
</P>
<P>
   While his lawyers were distributing their defense of the
president, he was at a memorial service for the 12 Americans who
died in the embassy bombings on Aug. 7. Clinton recalled the public
and private aspects of their lives as he spoke from the limestone
lectern in the vast, echoing National Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two sides of their lives _ who they were in their labors,
and who they were as husbands and wives, sons and daughters,
friends and colleagues, came together,'' he said. ``For as they
showed every day in their devotion to family and friends, their
work was about bringing better lives to all.''
</P>
<P>
   The breakfast speech was the centerpiece of his day, and Clinton
told his aides that he was up until 4 a.m. working, scribbling it
on three small sheets of paper. Despite a request by one senior
staff member, the president refused to show his staff his remarks
before delivering them.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that while he said he must always keep his failure
``as a caution light in my life,'' the country itself must ``move
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Clergy who attended the breakfast said they were impressed and
moved by Clinton's words of contrition, in language that drew on
both Christian and Jewish traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was repentant this morning,'' said the Rev. Joan
Brown Campbell, general secretary of the National Council of
Churches. ``And for me, that's more important than being sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the question for our nation is: Are we prepared to be
led by a repentant sinner?'' she asked.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rabbi Paul Menitoff, executive vice president of the Central
Conference of American Rabbis, which represents leaders in
Judaism's Reform movement, said he was impressed that Clinton's
remarks followed the basic steps required for repentance on Yom
Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement _ a candid admission of
wrongdoing, an apology to those who were wronged, a plea for
forgiveness and a pledge to avoid such behavior in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so much in line with Jewish tradition and the season of
Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur that we're heading into,'' Menitoff
said. ``It certainly added in my eyes to his credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Other clergy, however, voiced a more mixed response. The Rev.
John Buehrens, president of the Unitarian-Universalist Association,
said Clinton's remarks were ``a very sincere and heartfelt
confession.'' But Buehrens said he still felt deeply concerned
about ``the misuse of power'' evident in Clinton's having had a
relationship ``with a very young subordinate.''
</P>
<P>
   Some also offered praise for Hillary Clinton's conduct in the
face of the scandal. Ms. Campbell said she told the first lady she
had been ``wonderfully strong.'' Mrs. Clinton, she said, replied,
```Not always.'''

GERASHCHENKO: A BLAST FROM THE SOVIET PAST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe

<P>
   The ghost of the old Soviet Union's &UR;  &LR; doomed socialist economy
flitted over Moscow Friday, as two apparatchiks, one a man once
termed the world's worst central banker, the other the former chief
of central planning, gained key government posts.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's troubled economy may now depend on whether Victor
Gerashchenko, once again head of the central bank, and Yuri
Maslyukov, now first deputy prime minister in charge of the
economy, return to the Soviet-style policies they implemented,
often with disastrous results, in previous years.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of Moscow's deepening financial crisis, the
government disclosed it had missed a key debt interest payment to
Germany last month, widening its circle of default.
</P>
<P>
   The State Duma, the lower parliament house, quickly approved
President Boris Yeltsin's nomination of Gerashchenko, whose
predecessor resigned earlier this week in the wake of the ruble's
collapse. Ex-spymaster Yevgeny Primakov tapped Maslyukov, a
moderate Communist, for his cabinet moments before the Duma
confirmed the respected diplomat as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The twin appointments, which pleased Russia's communists and
nationalists but dismayed Western economists, seem unlikely to
inspire confidence in Moscow's ability to extricate itself from its
most serious economic crisis in years. By leaving open the question
of where economic reformer Boris Fyodorov might fit in, the moves
cast a dark cloud over Russia's commitment to reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous to conjecture about what Russia is going to do
with its economy _ no one has a clue,'' said Steve H. Hanke, an
applied economics professor at Johns Hopkins University. ``They
don't even know what they're going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerashchenko, whom Harvard University economist Jeffrey Sachs
once dubbed ``the world's worst central banker,'' is remembered for
the rampant money printing, hyperinflation, free spending on ailing
industries, and currency confiscations that transpired under his
previous reign as head of the Russian central bank from 1992 to
1994. He was fired after the ruble crashed 25 percent in one day on
October 1994 when the central bank sparked an artificial panic.
From 1989 to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, he chaired
the Soviet central bank. His father, Vladimir, was Stalin's chief
banker.
</P>
<P>
   While Gerashchenko, now 61, later reined in some spending, his
market credentials appear dim. ``I like the words micro and macro,
but not in economics,'' he told Reuters news service in 1994. ``I
don't understand all this stuff about micros and macros.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerashchenko said Friday he was in favor of a controlled
printing of money, but he derided calls for a currency board, which
would tie Russia's money supply to its hard currency and gold
reserves and prevent an inflationary printing of rubles.
</P>
<P>
   Maslyukov, 60, who wrote the Communist Party's economic program
for the 1996 elections and was briefly trade and industry minister
this year, is best known as the former head of Gosplan, the defunct
state planning agency that controlled nearly every aspect of the
Soviet economy, from 1988 to 1991. The agency, the antithesis of a
free market system, ordered state-owned enterprises what to produce
and when.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Russia's long-troubled economy has been in chaos since Aug.
23, when Yeltsin sacked his reformist cabinet after it devalued the
ruble and defaulted on some debt payments. While the financial
reverberations have spanned the globe, the effects have been felt
hardest in the former Communist giant.
</P>
<P>
   The battered ruble rebounded Friday to trade at 12.87 to the US
dollar but has lost half its value in three weeks. Prices soared 35
percent in the first week of September alone, shortages are
widespread, and most banks are bankrupt, leaving already
impoverished citizens with even less. Last month Moscow effectively
defaulted on $40 billion in debt, some foreign-held.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist- and nationalist-dominated Duma earlier this week
issued a non-binding resolution calling for Soviet-type controls as
a cure to Russia's woes, including state price controls, fixed
exchange rates, and income limits.

SENATE PANEL BACKS BILL MODERNIZING FINANCIAL SERVICES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., N.C., Texas, Ala., Conn.)  (mk) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate Banking Committee approved sweeping
legislation Friday to overturn Depression-era restrictions and
allow American financial services companies to operate globally
with far fewer limitations than under current law.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which the committee approved 16-2, would repeal
barriers separating insurance companies, Wall Street brokers and
commercial banks, allowing them to more easily merge into huge
financial conglomerates. In some ways, the bill validates financial
mergers already in the works, or planned, through liberal
interpretations of existing laws; in other ways, it allows for
entirely new financial companies to be created. The bill now goes
to the full Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a broad consensus on the need for financial services
modernization, and this bill does that,'' said Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y., chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.
``Today's committee action is a great step forward. But by no means
are we there yet. We've got good momentum, and I am hopeful we can
continue the process.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, this bill squeaked through the House by a single vote.
That action culminated nearly two decades of wrangling among
insurance, Wall Street and banking interests that had kept the bill
tied up in a legislative gridlock. Since May, however, markets here
and abroad have become more unstable, trade groups that once locked
horns have fashioned legislative compromises and powerful Wall
Street executives, like Sanford Weill, chief executive of Travelers
Group, and David Komansky, chief executive of Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.,
have led an aggressive and high-level lobbying campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill is so important to this country when we are having
financial turmoil from Moscow to Brazil,'' said Sen. Lauch
Faircloth, R-N.C. ``This bill would give a sea anchor of financial
stability to this country that we need so desperately at this
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all committee members were as convinced. The chairman of the
Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, visited eight Republican members
of the committee Friday morning to stress the importance of this
bill _ and to reiterate his belief that the Federal Reserve should
be the pre-eminent regulator in the emerging financial marketplace.
Still, the two ``no''votes came from Republicans: Sens. Phil Gramm
of Texas and Richard Shelby of Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gramm and Shelby offered a steady stream of amendments,
later withdrawn, as part of a continuing attack not only on the
bill's Community Reinvestment Act requirements, but on the
reinvestment law in general. The regulations require banks to
provide loans and other banking services to low-income areas where
they do business. The Senate measure would extend such regulations
to some forms of new wholesale banks, and both Senators said they
could not support any bill with those provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the committee's time was taken up with attacks on
community reinvestment requirements by the two senators. The
strongest came from Gramm who called proponents of such rules
``extortionists,'' likening them to the ``mafia,'' and said the
rules were ``an evil like slavery in the pre-Civil War era.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, D'Amato termed Gramm's efforts an attempt to put up
a ``killer'' amendment that ``would bring down this whole bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats, in general, are strong supporters of community
reinvestment and have indicated they might reject the bill if it
weakens existing rules.
</P>
<P>
   An amendment to eliminate ``lifeline'' banking, or reduced-fee
banking services, to low-income customers was approved along party
lines, with Democrats favoring the lifeline provisions, and
Republicans prevailing to abolish them.
</P>
<P>
   An amendment, offered by Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., to
protect the privacy of financial services customers when these new
conglomerates begin to cross-market banking, insurance and
securities products, was defeated, again on party lines, with
Democrats in favor and Republicans opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a regulatory structure in the bill that favors the Federal
Reserve was the target of an amendment that sought to carve out a
greater role for the Treasury. The amendment was defeated, amid
complaints by many senators over a turf battle between the two
regulatory agencies and what they saw as an unwillingness of
Treasury to compromise. ``Treasury has not wanted to tell anyone
what is an acceptable compromise to them,'' Faircloth said.
``They're letting us swing in the wind. We can't have a compromise
unless they will discuss with us. It's like clapping with just one
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the financial services industry praised Friday's
action. Cory Strupp, chief lobbyist for J.P. Morgan, termed it a
``huge step forward,'' while David Pratt, lobbyist for the American
Insurance Association, said, ``We are now in plain sight of the
finish line.''

US MOVES TO REDUCE ASIAN BEETLE THREAT TO MAPLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The US Agriculture Department secretary proposed major new
restrictions Friday on imports of wooden shipping pallets from
China in an effort to slow the spread of an Asian beetle that New
England officials fear could ravage the region's maple trees.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary Dan Glickman said he was seeking emergency regulations
banning shipments from China on wood pallets that have not been
fumigated or treated by heat or bug-resisting preservatives.
</P>
<P>
   It could take weeks or months, however, for even emergency
regulations to wend their way through bureaucratic approvals and
take effect. Officials had no idea what impact the plan could have
on the country's $65 billion worth of annual trade with China.
</P>
<P>
   But, Glickman said: ``The Asian long-horned beetle is a national
pest that threatens to wreak major havoc on trees everywhere.'' It
has no natural predators in the US.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was first discovered boring into 200 maples in Brooklyn
and nearby Long Island communities in September 1996, the
maple-eating bug has been found at 26 sites in 14 states, many of
them warehouses. As yet there have been no confirmed reports of the
bug entering New England.
</P>
<P>
   The only confirmed infestations have been in New York and in
three Chicago neighborhoods, one of which Glickman toured Friday
before announcing the proposed pallet ban. Hundreds of trees in
Chicago will have to be felled and burned.
</P>
<P>
   State officials in Massachusetts and Vermont are terrified that
the bug could spread here and ravage maple trees whose dramatic
fall foliage is a major tourist lure and which also produce an
estimated $20 million or more of maple syrup. About 30 percent of
the Bay State's larger trees are maples, according to US Forest
Service surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Controlling the bug is exorbitantly expensive, and normally
requires chopping down and burning infested trees. Eradicating the
bug in New York and Long Island neighborhoods last year cost $4
million, according to Agriculture Department officials.
</P>
<P>
   Separately Friday, Senator Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat,
introduced legislation to make the department apply ``the most
effective technologies'' to eradicate the beetle not just from
pallets and crates but all imported logs and lumber.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy last year helped win $600,000 for the USDA to attack the
beetle's spread. USDA scientists at a Cape Cod quarantine station
have been studying ways to kill the bug and save trees.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Collins, a top Glickman aide, said officials estimate
that as many as 1.3 million wooden shipping pallets from China
enter this country every year, and the number is expected to soar
as trade grows. Glickman estimated a quarter to a half of all
Chinese exports to the US are packed on wooden crates.
</P>
<P>
   ``All our actions need to be balanced with keeping trade
flowing,'' Collins said in a telephone interview. In recent weeks,
some Chinese officials have complained the restrictions were being
pursued to strengthen the US bargaining position in trade talks.

THE COUP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, September 13, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Clinton twice has been elected president of the United
States. He has balanced the budget, overseen a long economic boom,
presided over a credible foreign policy, built a large and growing
constituency on social issues, and brought the Democratic Party
back into mainstream of US politics.
</P>
<P>
   He also has been a secret high-spirted womanizer _ until a
series of illegal tape recordings by a Bush administration holdover
put a spotlight on the habit.
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, Clinton will be forced to leave office as a
result. It is an astonishing piece of political legerdemain whose
mechanics as yet are poorly understood.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who view the events unfolding in Washington as a
tantamount to a coup d'etat contrived by the Republicans (and their
indispensible allies in the press) have paid special attention to
recent decisions that have opened the way for the appointment of as
many as three more independent prosecutors to investigate the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The report on Clinton's marital infidelity that Kenneth Starr
sent to the House of Representatives Wednesday was only half of the
campaign against Clinton _ the hammer, as it were. The other half
is the looming success of the Republican campaign to force Attorney
General Janet Reno to appoint prosecutors to investigate various
aspects of campaign finance in 1996. Former White House chief of
staff Harold Ickes and the Teamsters, Al Gore's office phone calls,
and Bill Clinton's oversight of the Democratic Party's campaign
itself _ all these now are on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP now has an extraordinary financial anvil on which to
pound opposing candidates between now and November.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the congressional Dems are now caught in a terrible
trap. &UR;  &LR; To save their own skins, they must abandon the president.
Money problems, not moral revulsion, explain the party's panic.
</P>
<P>
   And money problems increase the likelihood that a delegation of
party elders will call upon the president soon and tell him that he
must resign. If it happens, the graybeards will couch their
disapproval in lofty moral tones _ but in fact they simply will
have been spent into a ditch.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the 1996 campaign finance scandals have mainly
been the province of partisan legislators, such as Representative
Dan Burton (R-Ind.), Senator Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), and Senator
Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), and Clinton-hating editorialists.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there isn't plenty to wonder about in the 1996
campaign. ``Issue ads'' for Medicare and the budget were accounted
separately from candidates' campaign accounts with their strict
spending; the national committee shuffled money into state
accounts; the political chieftains solicited ``soft'' money as well
as contributions for their own campaigns. Illicit contributions
from foreign donors hoping for eventual favors entered US politics
in significant sums for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   But as Harvard Law School professor Phillip B. Heymann wrote
last week, ``Fairness would require an independent investigation of
both campaigns, for there was little difference in what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Attorney General Reno withstood demands that she
ask the same three-judge panel that appointed Kenneth Starr to
investigate the Whitewater matter should now select an
``independent'' prosecutor to pursue her own victorious Democrats
for their campaign practices, while Justice Department lawyers were
left to investigate the defeated Republicans for the same
practices. Such are the vagaries of the Independent Counsel Act.
Reno presumably was determined to prevent it from once again being
used as a cudgel with which to conduct politics by other means.
</P>
<P>
   But after months of threats and bitter criticism, Reno finally
caved in _ because the campaign practices of both parties do indeed
seem to have violated at least the letter of the law, a judgment
ventured most recently by the Federal Election Commission after an
extensive audit. Reno has commissioned three separate 90-day
preliminary investigations, after which she may request one or two
or three _ or no _ independent counsels.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate effect has been to chill _ conceivably even
paralyze _ Democratic Party national fund-raising, if nothing is
done. Granted that the national funding has never been that
important, especially in congressional elections. Nevertheless,
party advertising has been instrumental in establishing the
national climate for each election. But what if each new dollar
raised is spent to comply with subpoeonas?
</P>
<P>
   Under these circumstances, who among wealthy Democrats will
donate with any enthusiasm to the national committee for the fall
campaign? The next test may come this week, when both Clinton and
Gore are scheduled to attend a big fund-raiser and unity diner in
Boston after the primary elections.
</P>
<P>
   A good part of the success of this spend-'em-broke strategy
depends on disguising the money issue. The incessant calls for
special prosecutors inevitably have failed to mention the disparate
and outsize burden that the quest for ``independent'' justice
imposes on the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   It also explains the Democrats' likely haste to hustle the
president out the door.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party, which set out in the early 1980s to spend
the Soviet Union into collapse with its defense buildup and the
``Star Wars'' initiative, which adopted an ambitious campaign to
``defund the Left,'' is on the verge of driving the Democratic
Party into insolvency through the imposition of legal bills.
</P>
<P>
   It's not an impeachment strategy. It's a coup d'etat _ the
sudden forceful overthrow of a government by a cabal.

   WASHINGTON _ In his confessional speech before a crowd of
religious leaders at the White House Friday morning, President
Clinton demonstrated his remarkable fluency with religious
language. .
</P>
<P>
   He frankly admitted to having ``sinned'' in his relationship
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, spoke of the need
for genuine repentance and renounced pride and anger, two of the
Seven Deadly Sins.
</P>
<P>
   But the most resonant moment for clergy members attending the
breakfast may have come when Clinton said the process of
forgiveness demands ``what my Bible calls a broken spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Alan Cooper, a professor of Bible, who
holds a joint appointment at Jewish Theological Seminary and Union
Theological Seminary in New York, said that the president's choice
of words ``immediately calls to mind Psalm 51.'' Its passages, he
said, make it one of the most famous pentitential psalms in the
Bible, a declaration of abject helplessness and a plea for God's
pardon.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish and Christian tradition attributes Psalm 51 to King
David. It is seen as an appeal David makes to God after God has
sent the prophet Nathan to rebuke the king for having committed
adultery with Bathsheba, and for sending Bathsheba's husband Uriah
into battle to be killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have mercy upon me, O God,'' the psalm begins, and begs God
``wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my
sin.''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase the president used appears in verse 17, in the
Bible's King James version, after the psalm says that God does not
want a traditional burnt offering as a sacrifice. Instead, it says:
``The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and contrite
heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.''
</P>
<P>
   From their remarks outside the White House afterwards, it was
evident that some of the clergy members recognized the president's
reference. Robert Franklin, president of Interdenominational
Theological Center in Atlanta, said that Clinton had used the words
of the 51st Psalm.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop T.D. Jakes, pastor of a nondenominational church in
Dallas, caught the reference, too. ``Is Clinton broken enough to
repent, but strong enough to lead?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The request for such a combination might be read into the psalm,
which asks God for restoration as well as for mercy.

WHEN GOVERNMENTS TIGHTEN THEIR CONTROL OVER OPEN MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ When Hong Kong and Malaysia placed curbs on their
stock markets last week, the outcry from foreign investors was
immediate and indignant. The governments were committing heresy,
these critics said, by turning their backs on the free market in
the search for a quick economic fix.
</P>
<P>
   But Hong Kong and Malaysia are not playing to an international
audience. They are struggling to ease the pain of a punishing
economic downturn on their people. In these straitened times, when
people are more worried about getting by than going global,
building walls around some Asian markets has become an increasingly
attractive way of holding the economic typhoon at bay.
</P>
<P>
   As emerging markets from Brazil to Russia tumble into crisis,
Asia's isolationist tendencies are alarming senior U.S. officials
and could set a profoundly dangerous precedent for the global
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have an unraveling of the global capital markets if
the countries that opt out do better than the countries that stick
to the orthodoxy,'' said Paul Krugman, a professor of economics at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Most major Asian countries still operate reliably open markets.
But as the regional financial crisis sinks into a prolonged
recession, it has shaken the faith of many here in the free-market
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no longer writing on the wall,'' said Donald Tsang, the
financial secretary of Hong Kong, who banned certain types of stock
trading and ordered a big government intervention in the stock
market late last month. ``People have begun to close up. Look at
our Malaysian friends.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 2, Malaysia discontinued trading in its currency, the
ringgit, and imposed sweeping capital controls on its markets.
Among the provisions: currency held outside Malaysia will become
worthless in a month; foreign investors cannot withdraw their
capital for a year. Some analysts said Malaysia had effectively
checked itself out of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's approach was quite different. Rather than close off
its markets, it plunged into them with a ferocity that left
investors slack-jawed. Between Aug. 14 and Aug. 28, the government
spent an estimated $15 billion to buy shares in an effort to prop
up the stock market. It also passed new regulations that restrict
the short-selling of stocks and rein in the free-wheeling futures
market.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Malaysia, Hong Kong's currency is still fully
convertible, and there are no restraints on moving capital in or
out of the territory.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Malaysia and Hong Kong have a common complaint: the
global market _ with its sharp-eyed speculators and
will-o'-the-wisp capital flows _ is causing too much pain. With
their stock markets crashing, unemployment soaring and currencies
under attack, these governments feel they can no longer give
foreign investors carte blanche in their markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing a general loss of patience with trying to satisfy
the international marketplace,'' Krugman said. ``International
investors demand a lot, and it's starting to look like these
countries can't do it while rebuilding their economies.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of capital controls is that they enable governments
to pursue economic policies _ such as lowering interest rates _
that might be untenable in an open market. Malaysia slashed rates
after its intervention, giving an immediate lift to its stock
exchange. If it had tried that when the ringgit was convertible, it
almost certainly would have led to a further devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   With Indonesia, Thailand, and South Korea suffering from similar
ills, such a strategy might be appealing to their governments as
well. One significant complication is that these countries are
receiving loans from the International Monetary Fund, which favors
open markets. But Krugman noted that Russia was getting IMF loans,
even though it had suspended trading of the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   Krugman has been both an observer and a player in the recent
debate over free markets in Asia. In an article in the last issue
of Fortune magazine, he proposed capital controls as a way for
Asian countries to gain breathing space in order to repair their
economies.
</P>
<P>
   Scarcely a week after Krugman's article appeared, Malaysia's
prime minister, Mahathir bin Mohamad, announced his country's new
restraints. Krugman disavowed responsibility for Malaysia's action,
but advisers to Mahathir said the Fortune article lent a veneer of
academic respectability to the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thrust is that in extreme circumstances, government
intervention is kosher,'' said Noordin Sopiee, chairman of the
Institute of Strategic and International Studies, a research
organization in Kuala Lumpur, which helped draft Malaysia's new
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Meddling in the markets is nothing new in Asia, or in much of
the rest of the world, for that matter. Japan and South Korea have
both intervened in their stock markets, while Taiwan imposes a
modest form of capital controls. China maintains capital controls
and a nonconvertible currency. But as Asia's growth exploded in the
1980s, most of the countries in the region adopted at least the
semblance of a free market.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? In 1996, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and the
Philippines enjoyed a net capital inflow of $96 billion from
foreign investors. Outposts like Hong Kong and Singapore became
gleaming financial centers by promoting their hands-off governments
and open markets.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Noordin acknowledged, ``the prevailing ideology is that
you must not touch market forces.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials are rushing to reassert the free-market standard
around the world. Lawrence Summers, the deputy treasury secretary,
said in a speech in Washington on Wednesday: ``It would be a
catastrophe if countries were to develop the idea that somehow
withdrawing from the global system was right, and that building the
right foundation for a market economy was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia has come under withering criticism from foreign
investors, who say that its controls will scare off investment,
retard economic reform and end up hurting the very people they were
supposed to protect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Capital controls are like heroin,'' said Mac Overton, a fund
manager at MBF Unit Trust in Hong Kong. ``Once you get addicted,
it's hard to get off.''
</P>
<P>
   Overton was equally critical of the Hong Kong government, which
he said had artificially inflated the stock market by buying so
many shares. Moreover, he said the government had imposed
voluminous rules and regulations, which made day-to-day investing
in Hong Kong an uncertain affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do I know they're not going to change the rules again?''
said Overton, who said he had sold all his Hong Kong investments.

IT'S PURNELL'S NIGHT TO BE SEEN _ AND APPRECIATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Sunday night he will step out of the huge
shadow cast by future Hall of Fame tight end Ben Coates. He will be
on display before a national television audience when the Patriots
play the Colts.
</P>
<P>
   Lovett Purnell will be seen. If things fall right, he'll even be
heard and mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a long haul for Purnell, a seventh-round draft pick
out of West Virginia. In his third year with the Patriots, he
always has been considered the guy who could catch the football but
couldn't block well enough to be an NFL starter. The past three
seasons have been dedicated to erasing that image. That's not an
easy task when you have no real chance to show your talents unless
Coates is hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Coates is hurt.
</P>
<P>
   He was still on crutches Friday, a large brace covering his
right ankle, which he sprained in the second quarter of the
Patriots' 27-21 loss to the Denver Broncos Monday. His left ankle
is also slightly sprained, and that apparently means he won't face
the Colts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always excited when you get to play,'' said Purnell,
who rarely speaks to the media, adopting a page from Coates's book
of life that reporters are not to be trusted. ``I've been playing a
lot lately. Me and Ben have been in the game a lot together, so
there's no difference for me, really. I'm playing Y in this game
instead of F. That's the way I'm approaching it.''
</P>
<P>
   The letters he mentioned are significant. Y is the spot Coates
usually plays, more stationary on the line of scrimmage. Purnell is
usually the F, in motion or playing off the line. That's what Keith
Byars did last season. Basically, Purnell has assumed the role
vacated by Byars, who was a combination fullback/tight end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben's gonna be back here soon,'' said Purnell. ``This is just
a chance for me to show that I can play Y even though a lot of
people like me to play F.''
</P>
<P>
   Purnell seemed to be at a low point a year ago. Because his
blocking wasn't developing, he wasn't providing quite the relief
for Coates that the Patriots wanted. That's when they decided to
draft a blocking tight end, so they Alabama's Rod Rutledge in the
second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talked to me and told me what they were doing,'' said
Purnell. ``With Ben getting hurt so much, they wanted a tight end
who could block and one who could catch the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Purnell had had trouble with the playbook last year, so during
the offseason, the Patriots wanted him to study new offensive
coordinator Ernie Zampese's system. He learned it inside out and
also, per request, improved his conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really in great shape when I reported,'' he said.
``Zampese wanted my weight down. He wanted to send me in motion a
lot, and I think I did everything they asked me to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking at film, Zampese was impressed with Purnell's
pass-catching. He decided to install more two-tight end sets in
which both Coates and Purnell would go out, figuring that while
Coates attracted the coverage, Purnell would be open. It worked
well in the exhibition season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's progressing,'' said tight ends coach Carl Smith.
``He's ready for the challenge, I think. He had a very good
practice Friday, real sharp on his stuff. In general in preseason,
he's been more accountable, more trustworthy in his play. We trust
him now to make his block. He's getting his job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Purnell will always have his hands full as a blocker
because ``he's a lighter-type tight end, 6-3, 240. He's got to
block defensive ends this weekend _ Al Fontenot and Dan Footman,
who are 290 pounds. You've got to have your feet under you.
</P>
<P>
   ``With his body type, there aren't any 240-pound tight ends who
are dominating blockers. What we're trying to do is replace Keith
with Lovett and Rod Rutledge. Lovett has terrific hands.
Outstanding receiver. They're always there. He can make the tough
catch. When Drew (Bledsoe) has to throw it hard, he can catch it.
It's his strength. Rod's got more power as a blocker than Keith but
none of the experience. That's what we're working toward.''
</P>
<P>
   Few players have worked harder than Purnell, who is striving to
become an all-around tight end. The opener marked a breakthrough
when he laid a terrific block to spring Robert Edwards for a
15-yard gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've definitely improved,'' said Purnell. ``Some of my coaches
from back home have called me to tell me that they've seen me on TV
and that my blocking has really come along. That makes me feel good
when other people start to recognize that. I've really worked hard
on that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what I'm doing. It's my third year in the league. I'm
more relaxed. Drew looks for me now. They depend on me.''
</P>
<P>
   They will depend on him Sunday. They will have to.

 HONG KONG: Kong investments.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The economist Milton Friedman, who is a self-described fan of
Hong Kong, said the government's intervention was a ``crazy idea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hong Kong has essentially undermined its reputation as a
financial center,'' Friedman said in a telephone interview from his
office in Stanford, Calif. ``It cannot remain a financial center if
it manipulates its stock market.''
</P>
<P>
   Tsang acknowledged that Hong Kong's intervention had alienated
some of its staunchest supporters. But he said the government had
little choice but to act because the former British colony was
under attack by a cabal of foreign hedge funds. In what he called a
``double play,'' Tsang said the hedge funds speculated, in
succession, against the Hong Kong dollar and the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Hong Kong dollar is linked to the U.S. dollar at the
fixed exchange rate, the brunt of the attacks was absorbed by the
stock market, which dropped 16 percent in the first two weeks of
August.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attack was sustained and professional, and we believed
that if we did not do anything about it, the consequences would be
calamitous,'' said Tsang, who will meet with investors in the
United States and Europe later this month to reassure them of Hong
Kong's commitment to an open market.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's buying spree lifted the stock market out of the
doldrums, though it surrendered much of its gains this week. The
benchmark Hang Seng index declined 3.5 percent Friday to close at
7,578.48.
</P>
<P>
   The long-term consequences of the campaign are potentially
thorny, however. Hong Kong spent $15 billion of its $96 billion in
foreign reserves to buy stocks. And it is now the largest
shareholder in several of the territory's leading companies,
including Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. It is unclear how the
government can sell off these holdings without depressing the
market.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, the government has been widely supported by the
people of Hong Kong. A recent survey commissioned by The South
China Morning Post showed that economic confidence was rising and
approval ratings rose sharply after the intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government cannot let it get worse and worse,'' said Shee
Leng Leng, a 29-year-old homemaker. ``How do you define a free
market? Nobody will regard Hong Kong as a free market if it becomes
too bad.''
</P>
<P>
   In Malaysia, officials said capital controls would give the
government the chance to repair the economy. They said such repairs
would be impossible if Malaysia continued to be buffeted by sudden
outflows of capital or speculative attacks on its currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our belief is that the international currency trading system
has gone stark raving crazy,'' Noordin said. ``Making a rapid rush
for a tranquil harbor was a wise course. There seemed to be no
alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   But outsiders are skeptical that Malaysia will reform its
debt-laden banking system or tackle endemic corruption without
pressure from the global market.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir's capital controls are a logical extension of his past
practice of blaming foreign currency speculators for the economic
collapse. Officials point to a rise in the Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange as evidence that Mahathir's policies are striking a chord
with the public.
</P>
<P>
   Appeals to nationalism are not limited to Malaysia. In Hong
Kong, which prides itself as the multicultural hub of Asia, the
debate over government intervention has taken on a distinct
us-versus-them tone, with officials and legislators repeatedly
drawing a line between local ``investors'' and foreign
``speculators.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Tsang sought to dispel any notion that Hong Kong
was blaming outsiders for its economic ailments. ``We love foreign
investors here,'' he said emphatically. ``It's a bit unfair to tar
my name with some other foreign leaders who might have different
notions.''

   RUSSIA-CRISIS-0911 _ MOSCOW _ Prime Minister Yvegeny Primakov
was confirmed Friday by parliament, ending Russia's three-week
political crisis. But concerns turned to the country's economic
turmoil and how the new government will deal with it. President
Boris Yeltsin on Friday appointed communist and former central
banker Viktor Geraschenko to again lead the central bank. He was
blamed for printing print money and creating hyper-inflation in
Russia in 1993. It prompted Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs to call
Geraschenko ``the worst central banker in the world.'' (Holmes, Cox

plunge in 11 years on Thursday. What happens in Latin America will
have major repercussions in the United States. A fifth of U.S.
exports go to Latin America, and American banks have made big loans
to Brazil. (Emling, Cox News Service).

Jamaica's known for its stunning beaches and plush resorts, but
being near the water and sipping margaritas aren't all there is to
do in this popular Caribbean country. Birdwatching, for example, is
attracting a growing number of travelers. And, Jamaica boasts one
of the Caribbean's most unique attractions: the Rocklands Feeding
Station in the village of Anchovy, just a short drive from Montego
Bay. At the station, home to 93-year-old ornithologist Lisa Salmon,
visitors can feed all sorts of wild birds from the palms of their
hands. Visitors can also hunt for butterflies -- Jamaica is home to
the largest butterfly in the Americas. So, you don't have to go to
Jamaica just for the water. (Emling, Cox News Service).

   CARIBBEAN-CRIME-$ADV12 _ PARADISE ISLAND, Bahamas _ It's called
paradise, but this island is having a hard time living up to its
name. In the past two weeks, three foreigners have been murdered
here, including a young American school teacher. The latest murder
occured on Sept. 2 when a man who worked on Carnival Cruise Line's
Fantasy ship was shot to death during a robbery. No one's been
accused of the crimes and so, according to the headlines, there's a
``Killer On The Loose.'' But the Bahamas is not only plagued by
rising crime, it's also awash with drugs, mostly cocaine. During
the first three months of 1998, officials seized more cocaine than
in the previous three years combined. All this hardly bodes well
for the reputation of the Bahamas, or for the winter months, the
biggest season for tourists in the Caribbean. The Bahamian islands
host 3 million tourists each year, and rely on tourists for 70
percent of their income. (Emling, Cox News Service).

 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Here is the text of the prayer offered at the close
of the breakfast with religious leaders President Clinton attended
at the White House on Friday. It was delivered by the Rev. Gerald
Mann of Riverbend Baptist Church in Austin, Tex.
</P>
<P>
   Our father: Our great land needs healing, a healing of the soul.
And so we pray for the soul of our first family.
</P>
<P>
   For Chelsea, let her feel the love and prayers that go out for
her. For our first lady, give her the strength to continue to show
all of us what grace and courage and mercy look like. And for our
president, give him the serenity to face the trials of this day and
the coming days and to let him know the forgiveness that can only
be forged by confession. Restore him in his soul.
</P>
<P>
   And I pray for all of us here who lead the community of faith,
when we leave here, it will be easy to join the ranks of those who
holler, and those who hate and those who hurt. It is only by thy
grace that we can join the ranks of those who heal. And, father,
remind us of the old, old adage: the only difference between a
sinner and a saint is that one's found forgiveness, and the other
one ain't.

GERASHCHENKO: A BLAST FROM THE SOVIET PAST 
</HEADLINE>

 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ghost of the old Soviet Union's &UR;  &LR; doomed socialist economy
flitted over Moscow Friday, as two apparatchiks, one a man once
termed the world's worst central banker, the other the former chief
of central planning, gained key government posts.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's troubled economy may now depend on whether Victor
Gerashchenko, once again head of the central bank, and Yuri
Maslyukov, now first deputy prime minister in charge of the
economy, return to the Soviet-style policies they implemented,
often with disastrous results, in previous years.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of Moscow's deepening financial crisis, the
government disclosed it had missed a key debt interest payment to
Germany last month, widening its circle of default.
</P>
<P>
   The State Duma, the lower parliament house, quickly approved
President Boris Yeltsin's nomination of Gerashchenko, whose
predecessor resigned earlier this week in the wake of the ruble's
collapse. Ex-spymaster Yevgeny Primakov tapped Maslyukov, a
moderate Communist, for his cabinet moments before the Duma
confirmed the respected diplomat as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The twin appointments, which pleased Russia's communists and
nationalists but dismayed Western economists, seem unlikely to
inspire confidence in Moscow's ability to extricate itself from its
most serious economic crisis in years. By leaving open the question
of where economic reformer Boris Fyodorov might fit in, the moves
cast a dark cloud over Russia's commitment to reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous to conjecture about what Russia is going to do
with its economy _ no one has a clue,'' said Steve H. Hanke, an
applied economics professor at Johns Hopkins University. ``They
don't even know what they're going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerashchenko, whom Harvard University economist Jeffrey Sachs
once dubbed ``the world's worst central banker,'' is remembered for
the rampant money printing, hyperinflation, free spending on ailing
industries, and currency confiscations that transpired under his
previous reign as head of the Russian central bank from 1992 to
1994. He was fired after the ruble crashed 25 percent in one day on
October 1994 when the central bank sparked an artificial panic.
From 1989 to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, he chaired
the Soviet central bank. His father, Vladimir, was Stalin's chief
banker.
</P>
<P>
   While Gerashchenko, now 61, later reined in some spending, his
market credentials appear dim. ``I like the words micro and macro,
but not in economics,'' he told Reuters news service in 1994. ``I
don't understand all this stuff about micros and macros.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerashchenko said Friday he was in favor of a controlled
printing of money, but he derided calls for a currency board, which
would tie Russia's money supply to its hard currency and gold
reserves and prevent an inflationary printing of rubles.
</P>
<P>
   Maslyukov, 60, who wrote the Communist Party's economic program
for the 1996 elections and was briefly trade and industry minister
this year, is best known as the former head of Gosplan, the defunct
state planning agency that controlled nearly every aspect of the
Soviet economy, from 1988 to 1991. The agency, the antithesis of a
free market system, ordered state-owned enterprises what to produce
and when.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Russia's long-troubled economy has been in chaos since Aug.
23, when Yeltsin sacked his reformist cabinet after it devalued the
ruble and defaulted on some debt payments. While the financial
reverberations have spanned the globe, the effects have been felt
hardest in the former Communist giant.
</P>
<P>
   The battered ruble rebounded Friday to trade at 12.87 to the US
dollar but has lost half its value in three weeks. Prices soared 35
percent in the first week of September alone, shortages are
widespread, and most banks are bankrupt, leaving already
impoverished citizens with even less. Last month Moscow effectively
defaulted on $40 billion in debt, some foreign-held.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist- and nationalist-dominated Duma earlier this week
issued a non-binding resolution calling for Soviet-type controls as
a cure to Russia's woes, including state price controls, fixed
exchange rates, and income limits.

A HALTING START, BUT FINALLY SOMETHING SOLID TO REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN   AND MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ordinarily, the spectacle of reporters reading haltingly from
transcripts or squinting at computer screens would not make for
blockbuster television.
</P>
<P>
   But no jazzy graphics or flashy camerawork were needed Friday to
make independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr's report on President
Clinton's alleged misconduct a major TV event.
</P>
<P>
   The whole world, or at least the whole country, was watching, so
the networks eschewed the usual bells and whistles and simply
transmitted details of the report as fast as they got them.
</P>
<P>
   There was an unscripted, ad hoc quality to the broadcasts that
went beyond even the usual unpredictability of live television. For
once, viewers were learning the news at the exact same moment as
the reporters. On the air, with the cameras rolling, reporters
skimmed through the printed or computerized versions of the report
in search of juicy tidbits, and then groped for euphemisms to
describe those tidbits.
</P>
<P>
   An obviously uncomfortable Bob Franken of CNN, summarizing one
part of the report, said: ``They kissed, he unbuttoned her jacket,
etcetera, etcetera.'' Sharyl Attkisson of CBS, describing a section
involving Monica Lewinsky's infamous blue dress, said: ``I'm
paraphrasing now; the stains were the president's bodily fluids.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, television lived up to its promise to steer clear of
the more lurid details of the report's sexual content, although
those details were sometimes visible on the computer screens that
cameras focused on. Anchors issued frequent warnings when the
broadcasts ventured into graphic territory, though on occasion they
sounded defensive, as when NBC's Tom Brokaw said: ``We want to
remind our audience that as we get into vivid sexual details, they
are framed in the context of legal offenses the president may have
committed.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Judd of ABC was first to report details of Starr's report
at 2:05 p.m., followed within five minutes by CNN, NBC, and CBS.
(ABC was also the first network to cut away, at 3 p.m., and resume
its scheduled soap opera). Throughout the afternoon, the story
emerged, snippet by snippet, as TV reporters and their producers
pored over the 445-page report.
</P>
<P>
   Television's paradoxical relationship with the Internet, which
has increasingly begun to draw viewers away from TV newscasts, was
on full display Friday. On the one hand, the networks repeatedly
reminded viewers that the full Starr report was available on their
Web sites. On the other hand, the networks delighted in reminding
viewers that Friday, television beat the Internet to the punch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet does not yet have it, but you're seeing it on CBS
News,'' CBS anchor Dan Rather told viewers, adding later: ``One
advantage television has over the Internet is you will never see
the words `Site Unavailable.'''
</P>
<P>
   However, CBS was the only network to cut away from the press
conference last evening in which Clinton attorney David Kendall
gave the White House response in order to resume coverage of
tennis's US Open. CBS spokeswoman Sandy Genelius last night said
the network felt it had already ``extensively covered'' the White
House response throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   That was not the only surprise Friday. In Boston, WHDH-Ch. 7,
the NBC affiliate, cut away from NBC coverage to carry CNN's
coverage, expecting to broadcast CNN's details of the report.
Instead, Channel 7 found itself broadcasting a CNN talk show,
``Talkback Live,'' to which CNN had switched. Channel 7 quickly
switched back to NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in newsrooms all across America, newspapers were
scrambling to package Friday's blizzard of documentation for
readers, weighing the right to know and the graphic nature of the
material.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Globe and The New York Times are running unedited
versions of the Starr report and White House response in Saturday's
editions. Washington Post spokesman Virginia Rodriquez said that
paper is reprinting both the report and rebuttal today, but ``any
information that the editors feel our readers might find
objectionable will be deleted.'' Philadelphia Inquirer editor
Robert Rosenthal said some excerpts of the report and rebuttal will
run in Saturday's paper with the unabridged and unedited versions _
and a note to readers about graphic content _ to be published in
the Sunday paper, which is available Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In its Sunday edition, which also hits the streets Saturday, the
Chicago Tribune will publish the full text of both the Starr report
and the Clinton rebuttal and will include a reader's box warning
that the material is unedited and may be graphic. The tabloid
Chicago Sun-Times' Sunday edition, which is on newsstands Saturday,
will include about eight pages of what editor Nigel Wade calls the
more ``vanilla'' and sanitized news coverage and a 36-page special
section of ``extended extracts'' of both the Starr report and White
House rebuttal.

TELL CHILDREN ONLY WHAT THEY NEED TO KNOW, EXPERTS SAY

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Phone sex. Oral sex. Masturbation. The stain on the dress.
</P>
<P>
   How do you explain these things to your children?
</P>
<P>
   You may have been able to successfully dodge the birds and the
bees up till now, but you can't avoid the subject now that the
Starr report has been released. It's graphic, it's titillating _
and it's omnipresent, screaming from the airwaves, filling up the
newspapers, slowing up the Internet. You can bet that talk about
what the president did with Monica S. Lewinsky will be hitting the
playgrounds and the corridors.
</P>
<P>
   The explicitness of it all, the complex morality issues _ these
may seem like more than a reasonable parent can possibly handle.
</P>
<P>
   But child psychologists advise parents not to panic. ``This is
an enormous dilemma,'' said Carolyn Newberger, child psychologist
with the Judge Baker Children's Center in Boston. ``Parents have
lost control of the information we feel is appropriate for
children.''
</P>
<P>
   But like other psychologists interviewed, Newberger believes
that while it is not advisable to hide the truth from your
children, there is no need to tell them more than they specifically
ask for.
</P>
<P>
   For younger children up to about age 11, she said, ``my hunch is
the details of what'' the president ``did with Monica may be of
very little interest to children ... For some, children, the issue
will be that the president lied, or that the president slept with
someone he wasn't married to.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true, she says, that for some adolescents, 12 and older,
some of the sexual details ``will be very exciting and confusing.''
</P>
<P>
   But for many older children, this situation presents a valuable
learning opportunity, a chance to discuss issues of morality and
values. It will give parents a context in which to talk about
``marriage and relationships and the whole issue of civility in a
civil society,'' said psychologist David Elkind, professor of child
development at Tufts University.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Brooks, a psychologist on the faculty of Harvard
Medical School, says there are two separate sets of issues that
parents will find themselves facing _ the morality matters and the
explicit nature of the acts themselves.
</P>
<P>
   He says one way to initiate a morality conversation is to talk
about the misuse of the president's power _ ``the reality that he
was in a superior position, and that what the president did was
wrong in terms of a failure of trust in his marriage, and also in
terms of not telling the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time children are 9 years old, they will be able to
understand this, Brooks says. ``Parents have to be very clear with
their kids. Listen to what questions your kid have, and if they
don't have any right away, say, `If you have any questions, I'm
here and will answer the best way I can.'''
</P>
<P>
   The harder conversation, he says, is the one about the graphic
sexual details of the president's affair. ``Parents do not have to
get into every nitty-gritty detail,'' Brooks cautioned. For younger
children, a conversation along the lines of ``the President had sex
with Monica Lewinsky and it was wrong (because he was married to
someone else),'' might suffice. Or they can say: ``The President
touched Monica Lewinsky and she touched him in private places and
that wasn't right because he was married.''
</P>
<P>
   With older children, ``my feeling is, be honest in a way your
child will understand,'' he says. ``If you're not comfortable,
there is nothing wrong with saying to your kid, ``What the
President did is hard for me to talk about, but I will try to
explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's probably inevitable, he says, that teenagers will be
reading the Starr report in the newspaper or on the Internet. ``I
really feel that if we keep it from them, they'll have other means
of getting it anyway.''

HANDICAPPING THE EMMYS: PATTERNS TO PREDICT WINNERS  
 (EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, SEPT. 13.)  
 (WITH EMMYS-SIDE) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVE WALKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - The Emmy Awards are scheduled for a butt-busting four
hours this year, so there's no real need to extend the frenzy any
further.
</P>
<P>
   But trying to guess the big winners, then second-guessing the
categories you've missed, is at least as much fun as goofing on the
dependably dumb pre-show glamfest on the E! cable network.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's Emmycast is expected to be a (long) loving look back
at 50 years of TV's winners and losers. One of the promised marquee
features will be a list of the medium's most significant moments
through history (as voted by TV journalists), so expect plenty of
archival sightseeing.
</P>
<P>
   Picking the elements of future Emmy retrospectives approaches
science, especially if you know some of Emmy's secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Oscars, which are often selected by movie-industry
has-beens who maybe haven't seen what they're voting on,
major-category Emmys are awarded by TV professionals who've
actually been forced to attend official screenings of the work
they're judging.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Emmy nominations are still made by the at-large
membership of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, which
explains the frenzy of promotional advertising that fattens LA's
trade-industry publications early each summer.
</P>
<P>
   Like good horses and mediocre pro-football offenses, Emmy's
final judging panelists have tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   According to Thomas O'Neil, author of the contest's definitive
reference book (``The Emmys,'' recently revised and updated for
Perigee publishing), Emmy acting judges like:
</P>
<P>
   _A character who undergoes change in an episode.
</P>
<P>
   _A fully likable character. (Or, if not likable, at least
humbled during the episode. Candice Bergen's multiple wins for
``Murphy Brown'' suddenly make sense.)
</P>
<P>
   _A character who has a problem with substance abuse. (There's
some more illuminating Bergen background. And Kirstie Alley was
twice nominated for ``Cheers'' but didn't win until her character
battled booze.)
</P>
<P>
   Yes, these are similar to the things Oscar judges tend to like.
The big difference, O'Neil said, is that the Emmy judges' actual
physical empanelment often counters industry buzz or sentiment that
would otherwise sway an award.
</P>
<P>
   By studying the episodes entered by actors _ and acting awards
are based on just one episode per season _ handicappers gain
insight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to see a real changing of the guard this
year,'' said O'Neil, who has screened each of the specific episodes
entered in the major categories.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Franz, who's won Best Actor-Drama for three of the past
four years for his work on ``NYPD Blue,'' chose a particularly poor
Emmy entry this year, O'Neil said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Franz is not even in the running _ he picked such a weak
episode,'' said O'Neil, noting that some Hollywood speculation says
Franz did it deliberately to give his co-star, Jimmy Smits, a
better shot at winning before Smits' departure from the show early
in the new season.
</P>
<P>
   Franz's lapse (or clever strategy) aside, O'Neil said he's
picking either Andre Braugher (of ``Homicide: Life on the Street,''
and an Emmy oversight for years) or David Duchovny of ``The
X-Files'' to take the category.
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny's episode was ``outstanding,'' O'Neil said. ``He cries
twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Braugher's entry was ``Homicide's'' shattering season-concluding
episode.
</P>
<P>
   According to O'Neil, Braugher's entry plays perfectly into
proven Emmy-winning strategy. Give a character an emotional
transformation of some kind, and Emmy judges take notice. It works
in both comedy and drama.
</P>
<P>
   Braugher comes from the ``arrogant, chip-on-the-shoulder school
of acting, and it's really worked against him in previous Emmy
races,'' O'Neil said.
</P>
<P>
   In this season's entry, ``He seems to be really humbled by life
at the end of the episode. He get's a wonderful,
what's-it-all-about scene at the end. That was a good call for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil says Best Actress-Drama is ``too close to call'' because
of the fine performances of Gillian Anderson, last year's winner
for ``The X-Files,'' and Christine Lahti, a yearly nominee for
``Chicago Hope.''
</P>
<P>
   In Anderson's entry, Scully _ like her counterpart, Mulder, in
his _ weeps. In Lahti's episode, her character is ``trapped in a
cabin with two girlfriends, and she stomps a rapist to death.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil likes Kelsey Grammer of ``Frasier'' to upset ``3rd Rock
From the Sun's'' John Lithgow for Best Actor-Comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He chose the episode so wisely,'' O'Neil said of the
``Frasier'' star. ``Grammer, who plays this haughty character, is
so humbled this year. Frasier's dating this supermodel zoologist,
but the family never sees her. Its hilarious.''
</P>
<P>
   For Best Actress-Comedy, O'Neil, as with just about everybody,
likes Calista Flockhart, star of ``Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Flockhart's entry (it's the one where Ally attacks
the woman in the supermarket) is double the length of any of the
other entries.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see twice as much of her,'' O'Neil said.
</P>
<P>
   And the performance itself displays the full menu of beloved
McBeal neurotica.
</P>
<P>
   Handicapping Best Comedy and Drama awards is slightly more
difficult, O'Neil said.
</P>
<P>
   These Emmys are judged by four panels. Each panel views two
different episodes of each nominated show. In the past, the panels
have tended to be conservative, favoring established shows and
stars. Sentimentality has typically scored well, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably a good system,'' O'Neil said, noting that it
allows a full third of a typical season to be judged.
</P>
<P>
   That factor considered, ``Seinfeld,'' which batted about .333 in
its final season, could be a legit contender for a Best Comedy
Emmy, provided that ``Ally McBeal'' hasn't built up too much quirky
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   However, don't count on ``Seinfeld'' getting any kind of
sentimental nod from Emmy voters, O'Neil warned. Neither ``MASH''
nor ``Cheers'' won the Best Comedy Emmy in its final season.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big, huge send-off finale doesn't always help,'' O'Neil
said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Best Drama, O'Neil said that ``ER'' is considered the
favorite among the three returning champs in the category (the
others: ``NYPD
</P>
<P>
   Blue'' and ``Law &AMP; Order'') but that ``The Practice'' could be
the upset special.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a long history of Emmy prefering law-based shows over
medical shows,'' he said. ``The spoiler could be ``The Practice.''
It's an amazingly well-crafted show, and David Kelley knows how to
win this award.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley, executive producer of both ``Ally McBeal'' and ``The
Practice,'' won five Emmy awards (as writer and producer) for
``L.A. Law,'' his first TV job. ``Picket Fences,'' a drama he
created, twice won upset Best Drama trophies.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley personally wrote every episode of ``Ally McBeal'' last
season, and most of ``The Practice''.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be the big year of those two shows,'' O'Neil said.
</P>
<P>
   And a big year for David Kelley. &QL;

LENGTHY IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY WILL IMPACT NATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite deep trepidation, the House Friday opened a
preliminary impeachment inquiry of President Clinton, an historic
process that could unfold for months with untold consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The spectacle began moments after the House voted, 363-63, to
launch the inquiry, as uniformed police officers unboxed 445 pages
of independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr's sealed report and began
to make public the potentially explosive material.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first printed copies went to Representative Henry J.
Hyde, an Illinois Republican who is chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, which will conduct the impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the beginning of a long climb up a steep mountain,''
Hyde said. ``None of us look forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although most House members returned to their districts soon
after the midday vote, many carried with them copies of Starr's
report and concerns about the ramifications for the presidency, for
their parties in the November elections, and for their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of both parties admonished members to avoid partisan
wrangling throughout the process, but bitter sparring began even
before the boxes were opened. Much of it focused on the refusal of
Republican leaders to inform Clinton of the allegations against him
before they were made public.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats also complained that GOP leaders reneged on a
pledge on how to evaluate 2,000 additional pages of Starr's report
and 17 boxes of supporting evidence to determine how much of the
sensitive material was appropriate to release. Starr informed House
leaders the material contained information that was confidential or
was improper to release because it could jeopardize ongoing
criminal investigations and the reputations of innocent
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than permit only two House members to review the material
_ Hyde and Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the top
Democrat on the Judiciary Committee _ GOP leaders changed
strategies and decided to propose that the material be available to
all 35 members of the panel and the panel's staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't rely on an agreemeent on this kind of matter, how
can we rely on agreements on other important matters we are going
to face?'' said Representative J. Joseph Moakley of Massachusetts,
the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Rules Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his protest, Moakley voted to begin the initial inquiry,
as did three other Massachusetts House members, all Democrats:
Representatives John F. Tierney, James P. McGovern and John W.
Olver.
</P>
<P>
   The state's seven other Democratic House members were the only
New England lawmakers to oppose the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, who had supported the initial agreement, said he would try
to prevent committee members from leaking the secret material by
keeping it under guard in a House office building. He said he would
not provide copies of the material to individual committee members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't going to have a proliferation of this stuff,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But as a sign that partisanship already has been stirred, Hyde
asked only Republicans on the committee to meet after the vote to
decide how to review the material. The panel has until Sept. 28 to
report to the Rules Committee how much of the material should be
made public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed,'' said Representative Barney Frank of
Massachusetts, a senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, after
the vote. ``Not to let the president look at the material during
the 2 1/2 weeks it sits here is really playing gotcha.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee, aided by a staff of 14 lawyers and investigators
_ nine for the Republican majority and five for the Democratic _
will meet regularly behind closed doors to review the material,
according to Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   He had yet to schedule the first official session, but he said
he had no plans to delay. ``Time is our enemy,'' he said. ``We're
fighting the calendar.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Sept. 28 deadline, the committee is under
pressure from some members of Congress to help resolve the issue
before a newly elected Congress is sworn in next January.
</P>
<P>
   Many other lawmakers oppose holding hearings before the November
elections because of the highly charged political atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most likely environment for the least political
circumstances involving a matter of this import would be right
after the election,'' said Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, a
South Dakota Democrat. ``I really think that that period between
Nov. 15 and Jan. 15 is going to be the time when you see the least
politicized environment in Washington and in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The House Rules Committee is expected to meet Tuesday or
Wednesday to set procedures for the judiciary panel to conduct its
inquiry, including rules for issuing subpoenas and contempt
citations.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Judiciary Committee completes its work, the panel is
expected to conduct an investigation, possibly including public
hearings with some of the same witnesses who testified before
Starr's grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   If the judiciary panel were to recommend articles of impeachment
against Clinton and the House were to ratify them, the Senate would
conduct a trial, presided over by the chief justice of the Supreme
Court. Two-thirds of the Senate would need to find the president
guilty to remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``This begins a process in which the path is treacherous and the
future is uncertain,'' said Representative Asa Hutchinson, an
Arkansas Republican who serves on the Judiciary Committee.

CLINTON PACKAGE &QL; 
 &QL; 
CLINTON-OVERVIEW (Washington) - On the same day President Bill
Clinton finally confessed to having a ``broken spirit'' even as he
summoned the will to a ``strong heart,`` Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr's report was released to the American people with a
thunderclap. Millions scrolled through the Internet while members
of Congress, who had just overwhelmingly to release the report,
jumped on airplanes and scattered to the four winds, leaving a
depressed and disoriented mood in the nation's capitol. By JEFF
BARKER. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
CLINTON-REPORT (Undated) - What the Starr report says in our words.
A summary. By MICHAEL MURPHY and PAT FLANNERY. Story will move in
the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
CLINTON-REBUTTAL What the White House said in response in its
70-page rebuttal. By MICHAEL MURPHY and PAT FLANNERY. Story will
move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
CLINTON-AFFAIR (Undated) - OK, what WAS the nature of the
relationship between Monica and the president, according to a sober
evaluation of the Starr report? By CHARLES KELLY. Story will move

and any other major Arizona players we can find in Washington
Friday to the Starr report. By ADRIANNE FLYNN. Story will move in
the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
CLINTON-POLREAX (Undated) - Reaction of Arizona's governor, Senate
president, speaker and many other politicians and candidates to the
Starr report. By HAL MATTERN and CHRIS MOESER. Story will move in
the ``A'' category. &QL; 
CLINTON-RADIO (Undated) - The talk shows Friday afternoon were
aghast, as usual. This is how it went. By MICHAEL CLANCY. Story
will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL;

in the public arena. But how did it perform? By BILL MULLER. Story
will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
CLINTON-MINISTERS (Undated) - Local ministers discuss Clinton's
confessional talk. By KELLY ETTENBOROUGH. Story will move in the
``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
CLINTON-CAESARS (Undated) - If you think the Ken Starr report
sounds seemy, you should check out the original version, a kind of
historical ``first draft.'' For the contents of the current report,
with its allegations of kinky sex in the White House, sound
surprisingly like the tales told by Suetonius in his ``Lives of the
Twelve Caesars.''

Carpenter. By DIANE BALAZS. Story moved in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
EMMYS (Undated) - A look at how voting for the Emmys works, with
insight on how winners are picked and entry strategies used by
actors, producers, etc. With EMMYS-SIDE. By DAVE WALKER. Story

A HALTING START, BUT FINALLY SOMETHING SOLID TO REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN   AND MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ordinarily, the spectacle of reporters reading haltingly from
transcripts or squinting at computer screens would not make for
blockbuster television.
</P>
<P>
   But no jazzy graphics or flashy camerawork were needed Friday to
make independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr's report on President
Clinton's alleged misconduct a major TV event.
</P>
<P>
   The whole world, or at least the whole country, was watching, so
the networks eschewed the usual bells and whistles and simply
transmitted details of the report as fast as they got them.
</P>
<P>
   There was an unscripted, ad hoc quality to the broadcasts that
went beyond even the usual unpredictability of live television. For
once, viewers were learning the news at the exact same moment as
the reporters. On the air, with the cameras rolling, reporters
skimmed through the printed or computerized versions of the report
in search of juicy tidbits, and then groped for euphemisms to
describe those tidbits.
</P>
<P>
   An obviously uncomfortable Bob Franken of CNN, summarizing one
part of the report, said: ``They kissed, he unbuttoned her jacket,
etcetera, etcetera.'' Sharyl Attkisson of CBS, describing a section
involving Monica Lewinsky's infamous blue dress, said: ``I'm
paraphrasing now; the stains were the president's bodily fluids.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, television lived up to its promise to steer clear of
the more lurid details of the report's sexual content, although
those details were sometimes visible on the computer screens that
cameras focused on. Anchors issued frequent warnings when the
broadcasts ventured into graphic territory, though on occasion they
sounded defensive, as when NBC's Tom Brokaw said: ``We want to
remind our audience that as we get into vivid sexual details, they
are framed in the context of legal offenses the president may have
committed.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Judd of ABC was first to report details of Starr's report
at 2:05 p.m., followed within five minutes by CNN, NBC, and CBS.
(ABC was also the first network to cut away, at 3 p.m., and resume
its scheduled soap opera). Throughout the afternoon, the story
emerged, snippet by snippet, as TV reporters and their producers
pored over the 445-page report.
</P>
<P>
   Television's paradoxical relationship with the Internet, which
has increasingly begun to draw viewers away from TV newscasts, was
on full display Friday. On the one hand, the networks repeatedly
reminded viewers that the full Starr report was available on their
Web sites. On the other hand, the networks delighted in reminding
viewers that Friday, television beat the Internet to the punch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet does not yet have it, but you're seeing it on CBS
News,'' CBS anchor Dan Rather told viewers, adding later: ``One
advantage television has over the Internet is you will never see
the words `Site Unavailable.'''
</P>
<P>
   However, CBS was the only network to cut away from the press
conference last evening in which Clinton attorney David Kendall
gave the White House response in order to resume coverage of
tennis's US Open. CBS spokeswoman Sandy Genelius last night said
the network felt it had already ``extensively covered'' the White
House response throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   That was not the only surprise Friday. In Boston, WHDH-Ch. 7,
the NBC affiliate, cut away from NBC coverage to carry CNN's
coverage, expecting to broadcast CNN's details of the report.
Instead, Channel 7 found itself broadcasting a CNN talk show,
``Talkback Live,'' to which CNN had switched. Channel 7 quickly
switched back to NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in newsrooms all across America, newspapers were
scrambling to package Friday's blizzard of documentation for
readers, weighing the right to know and the graphic nature of the
material.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Globe and The New York Times are running unedited
versions of the Starr report and White House response in Saturday's
editions. Washington Post spokesman Virginia Rodriquez said that
paper is reprinting both the report and rebuttal today, but ``any
information that the editors feel our readers might find
objectionable will be deleted.'' Philadelphia Inquirer editor
Robert Rosenthal said some excerpts of the report and rebuttal will
run in Saturday's paper with the unabridged and unedited versions _
and a note to readers about graphic content _ to be published in
the Sunday paper, which is available Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In its Sunday edition, which also hits the streets Saturday, the
Chicago Tribune will publish the full text of both the Starr report
and the Clinton rebuttal and will include a reader's box warning
that the material is unedited and may be graphic. The tabloid
Chicago Sun-Times' Sunday edition, which is on newsstands Saturday,
will include about eight pages of what editor Nigel Wade calls the
more ``vanilla'' and sanitized news coverage and a 36-page special
section of ``extended extracts'' of both the Starr report and White
House rebuttal.

<P>
   Phone sex. Oral sex. Masturbation. The stain on the dress.
</P>
<P>
   How do you explain these things to your children?
</P>
<P>
   You may have been able to successfully dodge the birds and the
bees up till now, but you can't avoid the subject now that the
Starr report has been released. It's graphic, it's titillating _
and it's omnipresent, screaming from the airwaves, filling up the
newspapers, slowing up the Internet. You can bet that talk about
what the president did with Monica S. Lewinsky will be hitting the
playgrounds and the corridors.
</P>
<P>
   The explicitness of it all, the complex morality issues _ these
may seem like more than a reasonable parent can possibly handle.
</P>
<P>
   But child psychologists advise parents not to panic. ``This is
an enormous dilemma,'' said Carolyn Newberger, child psychologist
with the Judge Baker Children's Center in Boston. ``Parents have
lost control of the information we feel is appropriate for
children.''
</P>
<P>
   But like other psychologists interviewed, Newberger believes
that while it is not advisable to hide the truth from your
children, there is no need to tell them more than they specifically
ask for.
</P>
<P>
   For younger children up to about age 11, she said, ``my hunch is
the details of what'' the president ``did with Monica may be of
very little interest to children ... For some, children, the issue
will be that the president lied, or that the president slept with
someone he wasn't married to.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true, she says, that for some adolescents, 12 and older,
some of the sexual details ``will be very exciting and confusing.''
</P>
<P>
   But for many older children, this situation presents a valuable
learning opportunity, a chance to discuss issues of morality and
values. It will give parents a context in which to talk about
``marriage and relationships and the whole issue of civility in a
civil society,'' said psychologist David Elkind, professor of child
development at Tufts University.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Brooks, a psychologist on the faculty of Harvard
Medical School, says there are two separate sets of issues that
parents will find themselves facing _ the morality matters and the
explicit nature of the acts themselves.
</P>
<P>
   He says one way to initiate a morality conversation is to talk
about the misuse of the president's power _ ``the reality that he
was in a superior position, and that what the president did was
wrong in terms of a failure of trust in his marriage, and also in
terms of not telling the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time children are 9 years old, they will be able to
understand this, Brooks says. ``Parents have to be very clear with
their kids. Listen to what questions your kid have, and if they
don't have any right away, say, `If you have any questions, I'm
here and will answer the best way I can.'''
</P>
<P>
   The harder conversation, he says, is the one about the graphic
sexual details of the president's affair. ``Parents do not have to
get into every nitty-gritty detail,'' Brooks cautioned. For younger
children, a conversation along the lines of ``the President had sex
with Monica Lewinsky and it was wrong (because he was married to
someone else),'' might suffice. Or they can say: ``The President
touched Monica Lewinsky and she touched him in private places and
that wasn't right because he was married.''
</P>
<P>
   With older children, ``my feeling is, be honest in a way your
child will understand,'' he says. ``If you're not comfortable,
there is nothing wrong with saying to your kid, ``What the
President did is hard for me to talk about, but I will try to
explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's probably inevitable, he says, that teenagers will be
reading the Starr report in the newspaper or on the Internet. ``I
really feel that if we keep it from them, they'll have other means
of getting it anyway.''

BOSNIANS GO TO THE POLLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina -- Old habits die hard here. Three
years after the war ended, most Sarajevans still walk on the
opposite side of the street on which shells once rained down from
the Trebevic hills.
</P>
<P>
   They avoid the pockmarked walls on the other side - indelible
reminders of a war that killed 100,000 people and drove another 3
million from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Like pedestrian behavior, voting habits are often instinctive.
People here traditionally have voted for candidates of their own
ethnic and national identities. In post-war Bosnia, however,
nationalism is a recipe for disaster. As Bosnians go to the polls
this weekend, they participate in the first democratic elections in
which they can vote for something other than nationalist loyalty.
Now, they are encouraged to vote for their future, not their past.
</P>
<P>
   While the rest of eastern Europe struggled to move from
communism to democracy, Bosnia was at war. There are still some
35,000 NATO peacekeepers, including American troops, here. The
leaders who are elected could determine how long these forces
remain in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, the moderate parties bolstered by the
international community are expected to do well at the expense of
the nationalist parties which have held sway in the past. The vote
will be the fourth and most ambitious election since the 1995
Dayton agreement ended four years of carnage.
</P>
<P>
   But some here worry that in their haste to impose democracy and
pluralistic politics on Bosnians, the western nations, especially
the United States, have created unrealistic expectations. Sudden
reform could backfire, leading confused or indignant voters back to
the familiar politics of the past.
</P>
<P>
   More fundamentally, some observers argue, the political system
here is stacked against those who want to share power. Chris
Bennett, director of the Balkan Project for the International
Crisis Group, says that election laws must be changed to force
candidates to appeal to voters outside of their own ethnic bloc to
be elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Multi-ethnic states need a system that protects all ethnic
groups from the rule of others,'' says Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   The promotion of the moderates by the international community,
however, may prove effective. Biljana Plavsic, the moderate
president of the Republic of Srpska, the Serbian entity that
together with the Muslim Croat Federation comprises Bosnia, has
used foreign support to confront the hardliners in Pale, the base
of the indicted Serb war criminal and fugitive former Bosnian Serb
president, Radovan Karadzic.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Haselock, spokesman for the United Nations Office of the
High Representative, the unit that effectively administers the
country for the international community, says that the Republic
under Plavsic is the strongest supporter of the Dayton accord.
``She is a former militant who needs to be bolstered with votes,
shown that there are material benefits down the road of
democracy,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers here say that the key question is whether Bosnian
Muslims, who were on the receiving end of the worst violence, have
the confidence to elect someone other than traditional
nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, American Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
stood here next to the Bosnian Muslim leader, Alija Izetbegovic,
one of Bosnia's three presidents, and said, ``Aid is a privilege,
not an entitlement.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Bosak and his wife, Hedija, hope that American troops
remain. A mixed couple -- she was raised a Muslim, he a Catholic
Croat -- they believe that life is improving. The water in their
apartment, for example, now is available most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Bosak predicts that class politics will erode the corrosive
effects of nationalism. ``The nationalist parties promise things,
but they don't deliver,'' he says. ``They pretend they are for
Dayton, but they are not. The people see this.
</P>
<P>
   If Muslims and Croats seem more hopeful, Serbs are more cynical.
Since 1991, the Bosnian Muslim community lept from 50 percent of
Sarajevo's population to 87 percent, while the Serb population
plummeted from 28 to just 5 percent today.

REPORT PUTS SEX IN MIDST OF CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The question may not be whether the American people will forgive
President Clinton for his transgressions, but whether they can ever
look him in the eye again.
</P>
<P>
   Never in history has so much detail become known to so many
people about the most intimate _ and lurid _ details of a
president's life. Or of anyone's life, for that matter. So
psychologists, psychiatrists, sexologists, historians and political
scientists acknowledge that they're wading into uncharted waters
when they discuss the effects of Friday's release of the special
prosecutor's report on Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Their initial observations nevertheless converge on several
points, driven by the fact that sex is now officially front and
center in the nation's constitutional crisis:
</P>
<P>
   -- That the presidency will be diminished by this extraordinary
episode, but probably not in the long term because people can
generally differentiate the man from the office.
</P>
<P>
   -- That it will fuel the already raging public cynicism about
public officials, not just because of the revelations about
Clinton's behavior but also out of revulsion that independent
counsel Kenneth W. Starr chose to reveal such private events.
</P>
<P>
   -- That investigations of and disclosures about other
politicians' sex lives, already the subjects of a growing number of
media reports in recent days, will now become commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   -- And, most immediately, that Clinton will have a tough time
governing during his remaining time in office, whatever his
political problems or prowess, because nearly everyone who deals
with him will be distracted by thoughts about his liaisons with
Monica Lewinsky _ whether they mean to or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that having these details revealed will reduce
people's ability to project their ideals of the president and of
the presidency,'' said Richard Kogan, director of the human
sexuality program at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. ``I
think, for the public and other politicians, this will make it much
harder for people to take him seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Miriam Baker, a prominent sex therapist based in New Jersey, put
it this way: ``I think all this information has made him too
human.... We revere people who control their desires, no matter how
realistic that may be. This is too basic, it's too primitive, and
that's going to lower his status.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone interviewed agreed sex holds such a powerful and
unique lure, particularly for Americans, that it will become their
principal focus, at least initially, whatever serious allegations
of legal wrongdoing the independent counsel's report may contain.
Far beyond that, the experts said, prognostication is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a totally unprecedented situation,'' said Elmer Cornwell,
a presidential scholar at Brown University. ``As all of this comes
out in excruciating detail, I expect there will be major
consequences. But it's hard to know what they'll be.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Cornwell and others foresaw as unlikely was the
long-term dimunition of the presidency. While they concurred that
Americans might snicker about the goings-on around the Oval Office
for some time, they said the status of the position had withstood
battering before, most notably from Richard Nixon's actions during
the Watergate mess and his eventual resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will tarnish both Clinton and what he's done to the
office, but I believe people have a way of ultimately
disassociating their respect for an individual and for the
presidency,'' said Irwin Hargrove, a political scientist at
Vanderbilt University and author of ``The President as Leader:
Appealing to the Better Angels of Our Nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Other fallout of Clinton's affiar with Monica Lewinsky, and the
breadth of knowledge that the world is quickly obtaining about it,
clearly will linger.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone in the political world expects voters to become
even more cynical about their elected representatives, for example,
adding sexual peccadillos to their visceral beliefs about how
self-serving and partisan politicians can be. That perception
almost certainly will be fueld by admissions and disclosures about
extramarital shinanigans _ two Republicans in Congress have already
pre-emptively come clean in the last couple of weeks _ as this
episode flings open the door to more media questioning about and
examinations of the private lives of politicians and candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe that the most important impact of this
controversy will be an explosion of investigations of people's
personal lives. In the next couple of years, you're going to see
this kind of thing nonstop,'' said Kent Portney, a political
science professor at Tufts University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a progression that's been going on for some time,
and almost inevitably now it has led to the president, but it's not
going to stop here,'' he added. ``I don't know how you reconstruct
a set of values that puts this sort of thing off limits ... so
we've got some turbulent years ahead of us. No doubt about that.''

 &HT;    RAUNCHY ACTS IN THE OVAL OFFICE MAY THREATEN PRESIDENT'S
SURVIVAL
 &HT;    Eds: material in grafs 9-12 may offend some readers.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Aside from legal questions about such matters as
perjury and obstruction of justice, President Clinton's political
fate may hinge on a simple question with a constantly changing
answer: How raunchy is America?
</P>
<P>
   Less than a quarter of a century after transcripts of President
Nixon's Oval Office conversations were made public with their
``expletives deleted,'' explicit details of Clinton's sexual
encounters with White House intern Monica Lewinsky were made public
in Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, popular culture experts avoided making predictions Friday
on whether the Internet-posted report would provoke a backlash of
disgust that could drive Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   Some said it might sink quietly into a public frame of mind
already numbed by years of ever more explicit movies, television
shows, lyrics and other sex-driven engines of social change.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Thompson, a professor of radio, television and film at
Syracuse University's Newhouse School of Communications, said
American society has been inoculated by three decades of
increasingly explicit mass communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``What (the Clinton-Lewinsky affair) really offends is the older
culture, the middlebrow America where these kinds of things are not
supposed to happen, the America that is concerned about propriety
and manners and values,'' Thompson said. ``But the popular culture
has never cared about those things.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all,'' he added, ``since the day we dumped that effete
British tea into Boston Harbor, this has been a pretty raunchy
country.''
</P>
<P>
   John Pitney, an associate professor of government at Claremont
McKenna College in California, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The details are so seamy and so tawdry that you now have to
check yourself when you speak of the presidency,'' said Pitney.
``You can now get yourself into a sexual harassment suit by just
mentioning a cigar.''
</P>
<P>
   His reference was to an episode mentioned twice in Starr's
report. On March 31, 1996, Starr charged, the president and
Lewinsky were kissing and fondling each other in the Oval Office
when Clinton used a cigar to stimulate her sexually, then put it
into his mouth and commented, ``It tastes good.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident allegedly occurred during one of 11 episodes
involving oral sex, which Starr said Lewinsky described in her
testimony before a federal grand jury. The two allegedly discussed
the details of these acts in terms that were at best not
presidential and on occasion, she said she saw Clinton
masturbating. But the behavior did not seem much different from
acts that have been depicted in countless R-rated movies and even
some television programs.
</P>
<P>
   A footnote to the report refers without elaboration to one
alleged occasion of ``oral-anal contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked at a briefing whether the president was receiving
psychological care for sexual problems, White House press secretary
Michael McCurry said he was not and did not plan to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the ministry to him and to his family by people of faith
that he respects, part of the pastoral care that's being given to
him is the kind of pastoral counseling one would expect,'' McCurry
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, intrigued popular culture scholars will be watching
public opinion polls and other indicators of public mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a buildup to it already,'' said Diana Owen,
professor of government at Georgetown University. ``The public had
kind of come to expect that there was going to be something
shocking. That buildup may kind of lessen the blow a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said the constant need by entertainment media to push
the envelope is reflected by the popularity of ``gross-out'' shows
on television like ``Beavis and Butthead'' and movies such as
``Dumb and Dumber.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The gross-out genre has become one of the most popular forms
of entertainment of the Clinton era,'' he said. ``The entertainment
industry may have already prepped America for this. The stand-up
comedians had already invented this Bill Clinton long before he
proved they were right.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pitney said Clinton has gone beyond the limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton controversy has extended the boundaries of what
people talk about in the mass media and the popular culture,'' he
said. ``I remember when you couldn't say 'toilet' on television.
This afternoon, they are talking about oral sex and semen-stained
dresses.''

CLINTON FACES A LONG PROCESS AS CONGRESS CONSIDERS IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr's report to Congress sets in motion a
process that will stretch well into 1999 as lawmakers began
weighing Friday whether President Clinton should be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the Watergate proceedings 24 years ago, lawmakers
lack a modern precedent to guide them in the extraordinary
procedure set in motion Thursday when the House received Starr's
report alleging ``substantial and credible'' grounds for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point we don't know how long anything will take,''
said a House Judiciary Committee aide. ``We don't know what the
time line will be.''
</P>
<P>
   A prolonged congressional recess due to elections in November
have thrown a wrench into the works.
</P>
<P>
   A conservative estimate is that the process will drag into next
summer, provided the Judiciary Committee _ the panel that will take
up the independent counsel's findings _ determines the evidence
detailed in the report warrants conducting its own inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   .MDSU/.MDNM/Starr's 445-page report, which centers around
Clinton's sexual affair with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky, alleges 11 possible grounds for impeachment, including
perjury, obstruction of justice, witness tampering and abuse of
power in an effort to conceal the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is only in the nascent stages of the impeachment
process. The chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., is awaiting a
ruling by the House Rules Committee and a vote by the full House
next week that would establish how much investigative power to
grant his committee.
</P>
<P>
   After the powers are established, one of the panel's first acts
related to impeachment will be to consider whether to make public
other material supplied by Starr such as grand jury testimony and
audio tapes. The panel of 21 Republicans and 15 Democrats will make
its recommendation to the full House by Sept. 28, which then will
vote on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent to that, panel lawmakers and the professional
committee staff will conduct a preliminary inquiry, possibly behind
closed doors. Essentially, they will review Starr's report and the
3,000-plus pages of supporting documentation and the 73-page White
House rebuttal to determine whether to launch formal impeachment
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The preliminary inquiry is going to take a matter of weeks
anyway,'' said a committee aide.
</P>
<P>
   If the panel votes for an investigation, the full House of
Representatives would have to agree.
</P>
<P>
   But the congressional elections in November will delay the
process. Congress is scheduled to adjourn Oct. 9 so members can
return home to campaign and was not planning to reconvene until
January.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is discussion on Capitol Hill of Congress
returning after adjournment in a lame-duck session if Hyde's panel
votes for a full impeachment inquiry. Such an inquiry in all
probability wouldn't get under way until next year, when the new
Congress is sworn in.
</P>
<P>
   An inquiry likely would last several months. In 1974, the
Judiciary Committee took seven months to investigate President
Richard Nixon using the voluminous findings of special prosecutor
Leon Jaworski as a guide.
</P>
<P>
   A simple majority of the Judiciary Committee must agree on what
are called ``articles of impeachment,'' the equivalent of
indictments. A single article is sufficient to remove the president
from office. A majority in the House must concur.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Rules Committee can limit debate, the House could
take several weeks debating any articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   During the Nixon proceedings, the House planned for two weeks of
debate, but Nixon resigned before the chamber took up the
impeachment measure.
</P>
<P>
   If the full House votes to impeach Clinton, the Constitution
then requires that the matter move to the Senate, which would
conduct a trial. Chief Justice William Rehnquist would preside as
judge and the 100 Senators would act as a jury. A vote of
two-thirds of the Senate would be required to remove Clinton from
office.
</P>
<P>
   How long would such a trial last? Prior to Nixon's resignation,
lawmakers at the time were planning for a trial of about two to
three months.
</P>
<P>
   No president has ever been expelled from office, but the House
passed a resolution of impeachment against Andrew Johnson in 1868.
The Senate acquitted him by one vote.

PRIMAKOV LOOKS TO COMMUNIST RANKS TO FILL POSTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Bolstered by a resounding approval vote in parliament,
Russia's new prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, promised Friday not
to revisit the past for solutions to the country's economic crisis.
But he said nothing about looking to the past for people.
</P>
<P>
   Following a 315-63 vote in his favor in the Duma, the lower
house, Primakov wasted little time in appointing a leading
Communist lawmaker, Yury Maslyukov, to oversee Russia's economy,
and the Soviet Union's last chief banking official, Viktor
Gerashchenko, to head the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The moves were roundly supported by the Duma. They leave
Russia's economy in the hands of opponents of the tight-spending
policies implemented by previous governments and praised by the
West to stabilize the country's finances. Maslyukov, 60, the former
head of the Soviet state planning committee, and Gerashchenko, 60,
were pushed by the pro-Communist alliance that dominates the lower
house.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov's lightning approval came after President Boris N.
Yeltsin bowed to pressure from the Communists and abandoned his
choice for premier, Viktor Chernomyrdin. Yeltsin's uncharacteristic
retreat ended a three-week standoff that threatened to explode into
a constitutional crisis. But it also left the president, whose
authority was already sapped by the crash of Russia's financial
markets and the ruble currency, more vulnerable than ever in his
six-year presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Before Friday's vote, the Duma had called for the
nationalization of important industrial sectors and the restoration
of price controls on basic goods and monopolies on exports of raw
materials and energy. But Primakov, a former KGB spymaster and
since 1996 Russia's tough-talking foreign minister, offered few
details of his plans for the economy. Instead, he called for
political consolidation and patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't expect quick results,'' Primakov told the Duma. ``I am
no magician. With the country in such a state, we will do
everything to stop its decline and promote growth of the economy.
Don't judge the government by its first 100 days.''
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, Primakov emerged from the Duma floor to tell
reporters that Russia would not ``turn away from reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Reforms are necessary,'' he said. ``The present situation
cannot be overcome without them.''
</P>
<P>
   Displaying his diplomatic skills, Primakov, 68, also called for
a strong state role in the economy -- something Communists have
been demanding for some time -- by invoking American history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody criticized (Franklin D.) Roosevelt when he introduced
state controls over the economy after the Great Depression,'' he
said. ``So what must we do? Repeat the wild capitalism that we had
up until now? Or use the experience of other countries?''
</P>
<P>
   Primakov's rhetoric reflected the exhaustion of people and
politicians here who have tired of the ``radical market reforms''
that a succession of governments have tried to impose with little
popular support.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where money has been largely replaced by barter and
where people have been hurt by the wild fluctuations of the ruble
the past few weeks -- from 6 to the dollar in mid-August to over 20
to the dollar on Monday and just under 12 to the dollar Friday --
the idea of some state control might sound like a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   But many Russians also remember that Gerashchenko, as head of
the Soviet Central Bank, oversaw a draconian currency reform in
1991 that wiped out the savings of millions of Soviet citizens. And
it was during his tenure between 1992 and 1994 that Russia
experienced hyperinflation.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Fyodorov, a senior economic official in the government at
the time, blamed Gerashchenko's practice of issuing easy credits to
insolvent Russian companies as a cause for the hyperinflation. It
is hard to imagine how Fyodorov, an acting deputy prime minister
who advocates the tight monetary policies that are no longer in
vogue in Russia, will stay in the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Most Duma members said that Primakov's main task will be to hold
together a country that has been steadily spinning out of control
for the past month. Regional leaders, lacking confidence in
bickering federal authorities, have dealt with rising prices by
enacting their own price and trade controls and by halting tax
payments to the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assignment of the premier in these conditions is not just
to conduct reforms but to save Russia as a state,'' said Grigory
Yavlinsky, head of the reformist faction of the Duma that proposed
Primakov to Yeltsin as a candidate. ``We aren't very sure that will
new economic team will quickly solve the financial crisis, but we
hope that Primakov authority as an official of the power structure
will stop the collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   Others sounded a more alarmist note. ``What is going on here is
a collusion between the president and the communists, to allow (the
president) to stay in power by backtracking on democratic reforms
and free-market economy,'' said Konstantin Borovoi, a liberal
lawmaker who was one of post-Soviet Russia's first highly
successful businessmen. ``We view the latest developments as a
communist coup.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin himself explained the compromise in different terms
during a nationwide television address before the vote. It was the
increasingly reclusive president's first appearance to his people
after a week spent sequestered in his country residence, during
which aides said he agonized over whether to stay with Chernomyrdin
after the former premier was twice rejected by lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tasks facing the government are difficult -- to get prices
down, to return goods to the shelves, restore the banking system
and guarantee deposits,'' Yeltsin, speaking in a halting monotone,
said in his address. ``It will not be easy but I am sure it will be
done because the government headed by Yevgeny Maximovich Primakov
will have the support of the president and the support of the
Federal Assembly (parliament).''
</P>
<P>
   It was a sad day for Yeltsin, who probably realized that he
could have given that same speech in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The president also reappointed the standing defense minister,
Igor Sergeyev, 60, and the interior minister, Sergei Stepashin, 46.
Yeltsin also named Primakov's longtime deputy, Igor Ivanov, 52, as
Russia's new foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   One of Ivanov's first tasks will be to explain to Germany and
other countries what Russia plans to do about the interest payments
it has failed to pay on foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
   Some Russian bankers have said that Russia cannot meet its debt
obligations. But Primakov Friday vowed that his government would
pay off foreign and domestic debts. A test of that resolve will
come Tuesday, when payments to holders of Russian treasury bills
are due. The previous government of former Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko last month announced a three-month moratorium on the
payments.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining the message he gave as foreign minister, Primakov
promised constructive relations with the West but added that he
would defend Russian national interests around the world. One
potential benefit to American officials dismayed by the return of
aging Soviet technocrats is Primakov's promise to ratify the
START-II treaty on nuclear weapons reduction. The lower house had
blocked raification of the 1993 agreement, in part to protest the
economic policies pursued by Yeltsin's government. But that is
unlikely to be a concern now.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For months, the American people have been mere
bystanders as the story of Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky
unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the release of Kenneth Starr's report, they have
assumed a central and conceivably decisive role in the case. The
report is in the hands of Congress, to dispose of as Congress sees
fit. A political process has begun, and in political processes, as
the Founding Fathers foresaw, the people have the ultimate power.
</P>
<P>
   It is by no means clear how they will use it, or what the result
will be. It is true that no president in the last 50 years has
survived this much trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But many clear-eyed people still think that he will hold on.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, Washington is lost. There is no precedent for the
present bizarre spectacle _ lurid tales of sexual hijinks in and
near the Oval Office, poker-faced lawyers in serious suits debating
the constitutional implications thereof, and rowdy legislators
trying to behave themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a movie, or a pulp novel, or an adolescent dream about
life in the capital? No, it is real life. Or the closest
approximation that the Clinton years _ the Harding era restaged for
television _ can produce.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Whitewater investigation began, and continuing
through the revelations about Ms. Lewinsky, the voters have been
telling pollsters that they approve of Clinton's performance as
president, however they feel about his behavior or character. Three
new polls, conducted over the last two weeks by CBS News, Gallup
and the Pew Research Center, found no significant change in that
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   The polls were taken before the report was released, of course,
and it is possible that Starr's enumeration of 11 possible grounds
for impeachment may change many people's minds. The explicit
details of the president's repeated sexual encounters with Ms.
Lewinsky _ and especially the fact that some took place in the
sanctum sanctorum of American government, near the Oval Office,
several while he was on the phone with a member of Congress _ may
have an adverse impact as well.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how ephemeral and imperfect the polls may be, they
suggest that if an election were held tomorrow, and Clinton were
legally eligible to run, he would stand a reasonable chance of
winning another term.
</P>
<P>
   Which raises a very leading question: Why would the politicians
who sit in the Senate and the House of Representatives want to vote
to remove from office a president, twice elected by the people of
the United States, whose official conduct has met with such
consistent approval from the voters?
</P>
<P>
   They might do so if they felt the political winds shifting
enough that doing otherwise could put their own careers in peril.
While it is true that legislators can and often do rise above petty
partisanship on great questions of state like war or peace and
impeachment, and they may do so at this time, it is also true that
they are as subject to the instinct of self-preservation as any
other human beings.
</P>
<P>
   And there are signs that many Democrats' sensitive noses are
already picking up the scent of such climatic change. Many senators
and representatives who face close races are publicly denouncing
the president, and others have made it clear they would be just as
happy if he did not campaign for them.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important, Democrats who are considered custodians of
the traditions and values of the Senate _ elders like Daniel
Patrick Moynihan of New York and Robert Byrd of West Virginia _
have been among the most outspoken.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, the independent analyst Charles E. Cook Jr.,
who probably follows congressional politics more closely than
anyone, said that this fall's election was most likely to produce
only modest changes, if any, in the makeup of the two houses. In a
new survey distributed Friday, he said the ``mid-range scenario''
would show Democratic losses of six to 10 seats in the House and
two to four in the Senate, with much larger losses clearly
plausible.
</P>
<P>
   The legislators might also turn against the president if they
hear from the voters, either directly or indirectly, that they want
him called to account. Public backing for the president might be
quickly eroded not only by the Starr report but also the faltering
economy; one reason many voters have given over the past few years
for sticking with Clinton has been a strong stock market and full
employment.
</P>
<P>
   Phone calls, faxes and e-mails in the next days will count for a
lot.
</P>
<P>
   Every president is weak at the stage Clinton has reached, with
only two years left of his second term. The reformer's zeal is
spent, and as political attention slowly turns to the question of a
successor, the incumbent's power on Capitol Hill wanes. For
Clinton, the problem is intensified.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike President Richard Nixon, who resigned in 1974 rather than
face an impeachment trial, Clinton lacks roots in Congress. He
never served there, and he has spent little time cultivating the
Democrats upon whom his survival may well depend. Some members are
last-ditch loyalists; every single member of the Black Caucus, for
example, voted Friday to give the president a chance to study the
Starr report before it was released to the general public.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Thomas Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, who
could be a pivotal figure, is much less locked in. When he was
campaigning four years ago for his present post, he promised to put
his colleagues' interests ahead of the president's, and he
reiterated that viewpoint on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see myself as an advocate of the president per se,''
he told The Wall Street Journal. ``I see myself as ensuring that
the president gets a fair hearing. I draw a very big distinction
between the two roles.''
</P>
<P>
   The 78-page rebuttal issued by Clinton's lawyers construed the
constitutional language about impeachment as narrowly as possible.
That will clearly form one element of his defense. But there is
precedent for a broader interpretation as well. During his days in
the House, Former President Gerald Ford said that an impeachable
offense is ``whatever a majority of the House of Representatives
considers it to be at a given moment of history.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there is a close parallel, no doubt intentional,
between one of the offenses of which the House Judiciary Committee
found Nixon guilty _ failure to ``take care that the laws be
faithfully executed'' _ and one of Starr's charges _ conduct
``inconsistent with the president's constitutional duty to
faithfully execute the laws'' of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The other main element of the president's defense is contrition.
Almost every public statement in recent days has included a plea
for forgiveness. But he has lied and dissembled so often in the
past, one of his friends in the Senate said, ``that you have to ask
yourself which Clinton to believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, as The Economist said this week, ``First apologies are
what counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, it should be emphasized, need not maintain the support
of a majority of the House and Senate to survive. In the Senate, a
two-thirds majority is required to convict, so he would need only
the backing of 34 senators to hang on. In the House, a simple
majority would technically suffice to force a Senate trial, but a
225-210 vote or anything like it seems an insubstantial, unlikely
foundation on which to build a presidential trial.
</P>
<P>
   Developments now unforeseen could, of course, make things worse
for the president _ additional revelations about his conduct or
indictments of close aides in the Lewinsky matter, for example. A
more heavily Republican Senate could easily be in place for any
final vote on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Future developments could save him, too _ a foreign-policy
crisis, perhaps, or a major terrorist attack at home. His lawyers
refused Friday to rule out the possibility of a deal with Congress
that would lead to an early censure and head off any more
protracted proceeding. Otherwise, the process that began Friday
could last for months, and that is a very long time indeed in
politics.
</P>
<P>
   As he weighs his options, again and again, Clinton will have to
ask himself: Survive on what terms, and to what end? He will still
have Air Force One and the Marine Band, still meet with
congressional and foreign leaders, still have his political allies,
unless he is impeached or resigns. But his moral leadership, that
intangible legitimacy that makes a president a force in the
country, has been shattered, and reconstituting it, after all that
has happened, will be even harder than getting 34 votes in the
Senate.

NATIONAL CRISIS OVERSHADOWS STATE PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In quieter times, a preelection weekend before a
Massachusetts primary is the final opportunity for insurgent
candidates who need a focused electorate and attentive news media
to make a final dash to the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   But this primary campaign is winding up, not bursting with
energy and fireworks, but rather blanked out by a national
political crisis the likes of which has not been seen since
Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really something else,'' Democratic gubernatorial
candidate Brian J. Donnelly said Friday, explaining the challenge
getting attention in the face of President Clinton's political
crises in Washington. ``It is beyond a distraction. This is
mesmerizing not only the state but the whole nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Lou DiNatale, a Democratic political analyst and senior fellow
at the University of Massachusetts' McCormack Institute, said the
developments in Washington have all but shut down the primary
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only chance for (the underdogs) was for the entire
electorate to be focused on this race, and it's clear they are not
focused because of what is happening in Washington,'' said
DiNatale.
</P>
<P>
   But even for Donnelly, the timing is a disaster. Most observers,
including his closest friends and advisers, see his chances of an
upset victory on Tuesday as slim. But just to make a strong showing
and gain some respectability to ensure a politcal future, his
campaign was counting on some last minute excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the time we want the voters to be focusing on us, and
instead all the focus is 400 miles down the road,'' said Donnelly,
a former seven-term US Representative from Dorchester. ``I just
hope the voters remember we are here in Massachusetts and far away
from that den of iniquity. This is a good reason why I left.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic contender Patricia McGovern, who 10 days ago launched
a $600,000 television ad campaign, displayed her reputation for
optimism as she described what she faces. But she, too,
acknowledged it is not a good weekend to be trying to put on one
last surge to beat Harshbarger across the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere you go, the first question is about the
President,'' said McGovern, who had just returned from a tour of
Southeastern Massachusetts. ``You get back in the car and it's the
only story on the radio.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, McGovern said she is not frustrated, but rather
philosophical about the events that are pushing her candidacy to
the fringes of the news cycle and away from the public's focus at
such a crucial time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frustration isn't the word,'' McGovern said, when asked about
the fact the news from Washington is drowning out her ads and her
campaign message. ``There are things beyond our control. You accept
it and just go and do the best you can.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, state Treasurer Joseph D. Malone has
also been denied one last opportunity to stir up excitement in his
insurgent challenge against Acting Governor Paul Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   But Malone, while greeting voters at Boston's Downtown Crossing,
Friday expressed confidence that his campaign to demonstrate the
ideological divide between him and Cellucci has already taken hold
and will continue to break through the clutter coming from
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe they (the voters) have already started to hear it,''
Malone said. ``Since the debate (between him and Cellucci)
occurred, the phones have been ringing constantly at the
headquarters. What people are saying is `This is wonderful, there
are differences.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Malone said Clinton's problems will in fact spur Republicans who
agree with him on cutting back government and lowering taxes to get
to the polls on Tuesday because they are angry at the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But while Malone gave his best spin on the political
ramifications, Cellucci was obviously pleased at the way the
campaign was closing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be pretty hard to break into the news in the
next few days, that's for sure,'' Cellucci told reporters, hardly
disguising his delight at Malone's predicament.

 &HT;    HISTORIC DAY ON CAPITOL HILL
 &HT;    
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ History weighed heavily on tourists who filed
solemnly from the gallery Friday after watching the House of
Representatives vote to release the explosive report that could
lead to only the third presidential impeachment drama in the
nation's 222-year existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was telling me that I picked a good day to visit. But
really, it's a very sad day,'' said Holly Morris from Lexington,
Ky. ``I think President Clinton is in a lot of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's changed things,'' agreed Bob Holland, visiting from
Redmond, Wash. ``But I think it's set a precedent on releasing
information directly to the American people without filtering it
through Congress. I think that's good for the public.''
</P>
<P>
   All around the nation's capital, the mood was somber _ taking on
almost spiritual overtones _ as members of Congress began
consideration of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's report
charging that Clinton committed impeachable offenses in covering up
a sexual affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sacred process. This goes to the heart of our
democracy. This is not politics. This is not spinning. This is not
a lynch mob. This is not a witch hunt,'' said House Minority Leader
Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a passage in the Scriptures where King Solomon says,
'Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart ...,'' said Rep.
Lamar Smith, R-Tex. ``That's what is needed during this time of
national tribulation.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, at a White House prayer breakfast, Clinton also struck
a religious theme by proclaiming ``I have sinned'' and ``I have
repented.''
</P>
<P>
   Excitement creeped into the congressional congregation, however,
after the House voted 363-63 to release the 445-page report on the
Internet. The vote sent Sergeant at Arms William Livingood to a
guarded room at the Ford office building where he cut the tape on
two white cardboard boxes and took out two black binders containing
the report. One report was scanned into the congressional computer
system.
</P>
<P>
   In offices all over Capitol Hill, staffers were soon crowded
around computer screens to read the online version of Starr's
findings. Some said the report read like a novel and many were
struck by the lurid details of the alleged sexual encounters
between the president and intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very sad and very shocking,'' said Trip Tollison, a
legislative aide to Rep. Jack Kingston, R-Ga. ``My grandmother down
in Brunswick would faint if she read some of this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And she would want the president to resign from office
immediately,'' he speculated.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the east Capitol grounds were crowded with TV crews _
signaling a move of the media circus that camped outside the
federal courthouse throughout Starr's eight-month investigation of
the Lewinsky affair. Dozens of satellite trucks were parked on the
west side.
</P>
<P>
   Members were grabbed for interviews long before they could read
the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some members are excited. I feel saddened,'' said Rep. James
Moran, D-Va., who was among the 63 votes not to release the report.
``I'm very apprehensive. A lot of it we wouldn't want our children
to see, but we've provided immediate access. I don't think that's
responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing near the TV set-ups, visitors from around the world
listened to familiar voices tell the tawdry story.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very sad for America, and for the Free World really,''
said Gerry Cutts, a visitor from Great Britain who was
eavesdropping on a BBC correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see how it's come to this,'' said his wife, Joyce.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the tourists had not read the report and some said they
wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got mixed emotions,'' said Donna Arnold of Kawkawlin,
Mich., among those who expressed disinterest in Starr's findings
about Clinton. ``I feel sorry for his family, but I'm tired of it
all. It's getting in the way of a lot of things that should be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Some said Congress would do the right thing _ whatever that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are honest men and women we have voted into office to
represent the majority view,'' said Donald Peterson of Fairfax, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we're trusting them to do that,'' chimed in Catherine
Fager of Murphysboro, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, near the banks of the Potomac River, a vigil
continued. Outside the Watergate condominium complex, a few camera
crews maintained a stakeout in case Lewinsky made an appearance,
although no one knew for sure if she were even inside.

 (For release Sunday, September 13, 1998)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Clinton twice has been elected president of the United
States. He has balanced the budget, overseen a long economic boom,
presided over a credible foreign policy, built a large and growing
constituency on social issues, and brought the Democratic Party
back into mainstream of US politics.
</P>
<P>
   He also has been a secret high-spirted womanizer _ until a
series of illegal tape recordings by a Bush administration holdover
put a spotlight on the habit.
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, Clinton will be forced to leave office as a
result. It is an astonishing piece of political legerdemain whose
mechanics as yet are poorly understood.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who view the events unfolding in Washington as a
tantamount to a coup d'etat contrived by the Republicans (and their
indispensible allies in the press) have paid special attention to
recent decisions that have opened the way for the appointment of as
many as three more independent prosecutors to investigate the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The report on Clinton's marital infidelity that Kenneth Starr
sent to the House of Representatives Wednesday was only half of the
campaign against Clinton _ the hammer, as it were. The other half
is the looming success of the Republican campaign to force Attorney
General Janet Reno to appoint prosecutors to investigate various
aspects of campaign finance in 1996. Former White House chief of
staff Harold Ickes and the Teamsters, Al Gore's office phone calls,
and Bill Clinton's oversight of the Democratic Party's campaign
itself _ all these now are on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP now has an extraordinary financial anvil on which to
pound opposing candidates between now and November.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the congressional Dems are now caught in a terrible
trap. &UR;  &LR; To save their own skins, they must abandon the president.
Money problems, not moral revulsion, explain the party's panic.
</P>
<P>
   And money problems increase the likelihood that a delegation of
party elders will call upon the president soon and tell him that he
must resign. If it happens, the graybeards will couch their
disapproval in lofty moral tones _ but in fact they simply will
have been spent into a ditch.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the 1996 campaign finance scandals have mainly
been the province of partisan legislators, such as Representative
Dan Burton (R-Ind.), Senator Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), and Senator
Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), and Clinton-hating editorialists.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there isn't plenty to wonder about in the 1996
campaign. ``Issue ads'' for Medicare and the budget were accounted
separately from candidates' campaign accounts with their strict
spending; the national committee shuffled money into state
accounts; the political chieftains solicited ``soft'' money as well
as contributions for their own campaigns. Illicit contributions
from foreign donors hoping for eventual favors entered US politics
in significant sums for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   But as Harvard Law School professor Phillip B. Heymann wrote
last week, ``Fairness would require an independent investigation of
both campaigns, for there was little difference in what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Attorney General Reno withstood demands that she
ask the same three-judge panel that appointed Kenneth Starr to
investigate the Whitewater matter should now select an
``independent'' prosecutor to pursue her own victorious Democrats
for their campaign practices, while Justice Department lawyers were
left to investigate the defeated Republicans for the same
practices. Such are the vagaries of the Independent Counsel Act.
Reno presumably was determined to prevent it from once again being
used as a cudgel with which to conduct politics by other means.
</P>
<P>
   But after months of threats and bitter criticism, Reno finally
caved in _ because the campaign practices of both parties do indeed
seem to have violated at least the letter of the law, a judgment
ventured most recently by the Federal Election Commission after an
extensive audit. Reno has commissioned three separate 90-day
preliminary investigations, after which she may request one or two
or three _ or no _ independent counsels.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate effect has been to chill _ conceivably even
paralyze _ Democratic Party national fund-raising, if nothing is
done. Granted that the national funding has never been that
important, especially in congressional elections. Nevertheless,
party advertising has been instrumental in establishing the
national climate for each election. But what if each new dollar
raised is spent to comply with subpoeonas?
</P>
<P>
   Under these circumstances, who among wealthy Democrats will
donate with any enthusiasm to the national committee for the fall
campaign? The next test may come this week, when both Clinton and
Gore are scheduled to attend a big fund-raiser and unity diner in
Boston after the primary elections. A spokesperson for the
Democratic National Committee says that fund-raising remains
``consistently strong.''
</P>
<P>
   A good part of the success of this spend-'em-broke strategy
depends on disguising the money issue. The incessant calls for
special prosecutors inevitably have failed to mention the disparate
and outsize burden that the quest for ``independent'' justice
imposes on the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   It also explains the Democrats' likely haste to hustle the
president out the door.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party, which set out in the early 1980s to spend
the Soviet Union into collapse with its defense buildup and the
``Star Wars'' initiative, which adopted an ambitious campaign to
``defund the Left,'' is on the verge of driving the Democratic
Party into insolvency through the imposition of legal bills.
</P>
<P>
   It's not an impeachment strategy. It's a coup d'etat _ the
sudden forceful overthrow of a government by a cabal.

   WASHINGTON _ With tears in his eyes, President Clinton on Friday
morning told a roomful of clergy that he had sinned. He spoke just
hours before the world was presented with a painstaking account by
prosecutors of when, where, and how.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing an annual prayer breakfast at the White House,
Clinton drew on the New Testament, the Yom Kippur liturgy and
Ernest Hemingway as he made his most abject confession yet of
personal failure, while declaring that he would defend and redeem
his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is a fancy way to say that I have
sinned,'' he admitted softly, saying that after resisting
expressions of contrition he had reached ``the rock-bottom truth of
where I am.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Clinton also asked for forgiveness from
Monica Lewinsky, on the day that the details of their intimate
relationship _ details that he had denied and struggled to suppress
_ poured out through the Internet, whose wonders as a tool of
communication he has so often extolled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to me,'' the president told the prayer
meeting, ``that everybody who has been hurt know that the sorrow I
feel is genuine: first, and most important, my family; also my
friends, my staff, my Cabinet; Monica Lewinsky and her family, and
the American people. I have asked all for their forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   In the company of clerics and to a rolling refrain of Scripture,
the president spent a solemn day in public with his wife, Hillary.
He spoke at the annual prayer breakfast Friday morning, and then
went to the National Cathedral at midday to address a memorial
service for the victims of twin bombings at U.S. embassies in East
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Under cloudless skies late Friday afternoon, he received the
Paul O'Dwyer Freedom and Justice Award in a ceremony on the South
Lawn of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Apology aside, it was a fundamentally normal presidential
schedule, on one of the strangest days in the history of the
presidency. The Clintons, two fierce political fighters, had
finally and utterly lost perhaps their most bitterly fought battle,
to maintain what Mrs. Clinton has often called a ``zone of
privacy'' for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an unusual, and I think unusually important, day
today,'' the president said in his remarks at the prayer breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton expressed gratitude to those who thought ``the bounds of
privacy have been excessively and unwisely invaded,'' but added,
``in this case, it may be a blessing, because I still sinned. And
if my repentance is genuine and sustained and if I can maintain
both a broken spirit and a strong heart, then good can come of this
for our country as well as for me and my family.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his experience could teach children that ``integrity is
important and selfishness is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 10-minute remarks, Clinton tried to walk a line between
abject contrition and the fierce determination to fight that he has
expressed privately to friends. ``I will instruct my lawyers to
mount a vigorous defense, using all available appropriate legal
arguments,'' he said, ``but legal language must not obscure the
fact that I have done wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Clinton's lawyers later issued a 73-page defense before
they had read the report by Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater
independent counsel. Starr and Congress had rebuffed White House
requests for an advance look at the report.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not always seem grim in public on Friday. At the
memorial service, he turned around in his straight-backed chair to
exchange a laugh with Donna Shalala, the secretary of health and
human services.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting Clinton called to apologize to his Cabinet on
Thursday, Shalala challenged an argument he made that presidents
should be judged by their policies in public, not their behavior in
private. ``Mr. President, surely you don't believe that,'' she
said, according to a person familiar with the exchange. Clinton did
not back down an inch, this person said.
</P>
<P>
   While his lawyers were distributing their defense of the
president, he was at a memorial service for the 12 Americans who
died in the embassy bombings on Aug. 7. Clinton recalled the public
and private aspects of their lives as he spoke from the limestone
lectern in the vast, echoing National Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two sides of their lives _ who they were in their labors,
and who they were as husbands and wives, sons and daughters,
friends and colleagues, came together,'' he said. ``For as they
showed every day in their devotion to family and friends, their
work was about bringing better lives to all.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was the breakfast speech that was the centerpiece of
Clinton's day, and he told his aides that he was up until 4 a.m.
working, scribbling it on three small sheets of paper. Despite a
request by one senior aide, the president refused to show his staff
his remarks before delivering them.
</P>
<P>
   In those remarks, Clinton said that while he must always keep
his failure ``as a caution light in my life,'' the country itself
must ``move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Clerics who attended the breakfast said they had been impressed
and moved by Clinton's words of contrition, in language that drew
on both Christian and Jewish traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was repentant this morning,'' said the Rev. Joan
Brown Campbell, general secretary of the National Council of
Churches. ``And for me, that's more important than being sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the question for our nation is: Are we prepared to be
led by a repentant sinner?'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Paul Menitoff, executive vice president of the Central
Conference of American Rabbis, which represents leaders in
Judaism's Reform movement, said he was impressed that Clinton's
remarks followed the basic steps required for repentance on Yom
Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement _ a candid admission of
wrongdoing, an apology to those who were wronged, a plea for
forgiveness and a pledge to avoid such behavior in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so much in line with Jewish tradition and the season of
Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur that we're heading into,'' Menitoff
said. ``It certainly added in my eyes to his credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Other clergy, however, voiced a more mixed response. The Rev.
John Buehrens, president of the Unitarian-Universalist Association,
said Clinton's remarks were ``a very sincere and heartfelt
confession.'' But Buehrens said he still felt deeply concerned
about ``the misuse of power'' evident in Clinton's having had a
relationship ``with a very young subordinate.''
</P>
<P>
   Some also offered praise for Hillary Clinton's conduct in the
face of the scandal. Ms. Campbell said she told the first lady she
had been ``wonderfully strong.'' Mrs. Clinton, she said, replied,
```Not always.'''

<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  BOSTON _ A priest who has been sued by a Charlestown man for
allegedly molesting him during a five-year period while training
him as an altar boy is currently serving time in a Vermont prison
for molesting a young boy in his apartment.

<P>
   Robert M. &UR;  &LR; Burns, who is no longer a priest, pleaded guilty in
March 1996 to two counts of molesting a boy he lured into his
Salem, N.H., apartment. Authorities said he promised to show him
computer images of women in swimsuits.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Brian Lacey, 21, of Charlestown, and his mother,
Annemarie Vesey, sued Burns, the Archdiocese of Boston and church
officials in Ohio alleging the church knew Burns had been an active
pedophile for decades, yet still allowed him to work with children
in two Boston parishes during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit filed in Suffolk Superior Court, Lacey alleges
that Burns sexually molested him in St. Mary's church and its
rectory from 1987 until 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Burns allegedly had molested children in Ohio and was sent for
counseling and treatment, according to the lawsuit. But Burns'
record was kept secret after he was reassigned to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   He apparently has already been sued by another victim from
Charlestown, a suit that was settled for $80,000 to 90,000,
according to an Associated Press account of Burns' guilty plea in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Philip Saviano recalled talking with Lacey, 21, in
January. He wanted to talk about how Burns molested him beginning
when he was 11 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian was very young when this happened to him,'' Saviano
said. ``It was very traumatic. He kept it to himself for so many,
many years. Going through adolescence and keeping a secret like
that can be very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Saviano, who is regional coordinator of Survivors Network for
those Abused by Priests (SNAP), praised Lacey and his mother for
taking a stand against Burns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an important step for him, in starting to take charge of
the situation,'' Saviano said.
</P>
<P>
   John Walsh, spokesman for the Boston Archdiocese, said he did
not recall any other litigation involving Burns. He said if a case
has been settled, the archdiocese's general policy is not to
discuss it publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1990s when the Father James Porter case surfaced
with its numerous victims, Walsh said, the Boston Archdiocese has
crafted new policies to protect parishioners. One key component is
the immediate removal of a priest if a substantive complaint of
sexual misconduct is lodged. Porter was allowed to remain in
parishes despite complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh also noted that Cardinal Bernard Law has assigned a
priest, Rev. William Murphy, as the contact for anyone who wants to
report prior or current allegations of abuse. He said the church
will refer alleged victims to police, to counselors or notify them
that they can retain an attorney to represent them in a civil
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In the Worcester diocese, some 15 priests have been accused in
civil lawsuits or have admitted in criminal court that they
sexually abused women and children during the 1990s. Walsh said
that he has seen a decline in the number of new cases alleging
sexual abuse by priests in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that something like this would never happen again,''
he said. ``But we can never say that this is over, we have taken
care of the problem. We don't ever say it is over.''

THE EMMYS: THE LONGEST NIGHT ON TV 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Television will observe 50 years of Emmy awards with an Emmy
awards program that's sure to seem 50 years long.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 50th Annual Prime-Time Emmy Awards'' is scheduled to run
four hours on NBC Sunday night. That means that even if it finishes
on time, it'll be the longest Emmy show ever.
</P>
<P>
   I believe that when the telecast reaches a record-smashing three
hours and 51 minutes, the show will pause. At that point, producer
Don Mischer will circle the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles,
high-five audience members and hug the family of Roger Maris.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no host. Mischer believes that hosts aren't all
heavenly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hosts can be great,'' he said in a recent interview, ``but
also when things tend to go wrong, it's almost always in the host
area, because hosts have to be serviced.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy enough. Call for Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   I'm soooo sorry.
</P>
<P>
   We will see legions of presenters, asked by Mischer to recall
``something personal about television,'' and a laundry list of
50th-anniversary special segments.
</P>
<P>
   Mischer was anticipating a feature about series finales, several
man-on-the-street pieces with common folks talking about how TV has
ruined their lives _ no, excuse me, how TV has influenced their
lives _ and a humorous look back at some of TV's greatest gaffes.
</P>
<P>
   Remember ``Misfits of Science,'' with a 7-foot-4 vegetable man,
a rock musician who flung 20,000 volts from his fingertips and a
teenage girl who could levitate cars? And they were all going to
save the world? And NBC almost included a flying dog that shot
sparks from its butt?
</P>
<P>
   Well, that would be what they consider a TV mistake.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of all this breast-beating about 50 years of Emmy
awards, someone might recall that the first Emmy, back in 1948, was
won by Los Angeles TV personality Shirley Dinsdale. And her puppet
Judy Splinters.
</P>
<P>
   Dinsdale is still around. Judy Splinters, in all likelihood,
needs servicing.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes, the awards. It's no use guessing who'll win them,
because either your loyal TV critic is invariably wrong or the
Academy of Television Arts and Sciences is as predictable as a
truck full of monkeys.
</P>
<P>
   So instead, here's a short list of deserving winners: Garry
Shandling.
</P>
<P>
   He's up, again, for lead actor in a comedy series. Again as in
19 lifetime nominations and not one solitary win. And now, sob,
``The Larry Sanders Show'' has gone the way of ``It's Garry
Shandling's Show.''
</P>
<P>
   All right, a longer list. Calista Flockhart for lead actress in
a comedy series. That's right, ``Ally McBeal'' is officially a
comedy series. We're not guessing officially, mind you, but Helen
Hunt probably has a leg up in this category. She already won an
Oscar this year.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Lahti of ``Chicago Hope'' for lead actress in a drama
series, and for God's sake don't give her a bathroom pass.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Braugher of ``Homicide: Life on the Street'' for lead
actor in a drama. But when it comes to Braugher and ``Homicide,''
the academy never listens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armistead Maupin's More Tales of the City'' for outstanding
miniseries, though Tom Hanks' ``From the Earth to the Moon'' is the
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don King: Only in America'' for best TV movie, because it
crackled like an electrical storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Larry Sanders Show'' for outstanding comedy series because
``Frasier,'' if the voters were actually watching, had an off year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Practice'' for outstanding drama series because ``ER,''
``NYPD Blue,'' ``Law &AMP; Order'' and even ``The X-Files'' have become
a little creaky.
</P>
<P>
   One of my few actual predictions is that all of my choices will
lose. Let's face it. It's just possible that I need servicing.

GREAT-GRANDSON OF HENRY FORD NAMED FORD MOTOR CO. CHAIRMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  (js) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ One of the most storied families in U.S.
business reasserted its control over the world's second-largest
company Friday as William Clay Ford Jr., a great-grandson of Henry
Ford, was named the next chairman of Ford Motor Co..
</P>
<P>
   Ford's current chairman, chief executive and president,
Alexander Trotman, who is 65, announced that he would retire at the
end of December, a year earlier than expected. Ford, the
41-year-old chairman of the Ford board's committees on finance and
the environment, will replace him as chairman of the company then.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Nasser, 50, president of Ford's worldwide automotive
operations, will replace Trotman as the chief executive and
president at the end of the year and will retain his current title.
</P>
<P>
   In splitting the jobs of chairman and chief executive, Ford is
following an approach popular overseas but seldom seen in the
United States. General Motors, the world's largest company in terms
of sales and share of global economic output, divided the jobs from
1992 to 1995 and chose an outside director as chairman, but only
after the company's poor performance in the 1991 recession had
destroyed Wall Street's confidence in G.M.'s management.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, whose family holds a special class of stock that gives it
40 percent of the voting rights at Ford, said he had no interest in
being chief executive. ``Having watched how large this company has
become, and how tough it is to manage, I think separating these
jobs makes a lot of sense,'' said Ford, who is raising four
children with his wife, Lisa.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said that he would continue to run the Detroit Lions
professional football team, which his ailing father owns, but that
he would devote the bulk of his time to Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts predicted that the combination of Nasser
and Ford would work well as long as Ford had other commitments. The
two men have been friends since the early 1980s, when Ford was one
of eight financial analysts reporting to Nasser, who oversaw Ford's
financial operations in Latin America and Asia at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Ford and his grandson, Henry Ford II, ran the company from
its founding in 1903 until Henry Ford II stepped down in 1980. The
company has been led by professional managers since then because
the younger brother of Henry Ford II, William Clay Ford, was in
poor health and the next generation of Ford family members was
deemed too young.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A Princeton University graduate who spent a year studying
business at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Ford has won
a remarkable number of admirers on Wall Street for his intelligence
and charisma. But his close ties to environmentalists and his
periodic calls for the auto industry to pay closer attention to
environmental issues have alarmed some auto executives. Their fear
has been that the scion of a billionaire family could put
environmental causes ahead of profits and undermine the industry's
traditionally united front against pressures from environmental
groups.
</P>
<P>
   For example, GM and Chrysler executives were furious last
January when Ford announced that it would voluntarily make all of
its sport utility vehicles and Windstar mini-vans nearly as clean
as cars, at a cost of about $100 a vehicle. Ford executives said at
the time that Nasser had made the decision, but Nasser has said
little about the environment over the years and has long been an
ally of Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Ford mentioned the environment several times at a news
conference Friday, noting at the beginning of his prepared remarks,
``My vision for the company is product leadership, the highest
quality and customer satisfaction and environmental leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   In a subsequent interview, Ford acknowledged ``a tension''
between environmentalism and the pursuit of profits in the short
term. But in the long term, he said, Ford can distinguish itself
from its rivals, selling more vehicles and attracting better
employees, by earning a reputation for being environmentally
friendly.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Ford is earning record profits mainly because of
soaring sales of its full-size sport utility vehicles, like the
Ford Expedition, and big pickup trucks like the F-250, which burn a
lot of gasoline. ``I don't think for a second he's proposing Ford
stop making Expeditions and F-250s _ this is a company that brought
out some of the world's largest and heaviest passenger vehicles,''
said Maryann Keller, a longtime auto analyst at Furman Selz.
</P>
<P>
   News of the succession overshadowed another Ford announcement on
Friday, that it will withdraw from the auction of Kia Motors Corp.
of South Korea and its affiliate, Asia Motors Co..

CLINTON FACES A LONG PROCESS AS CONGRESS CONSIDERS IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Refiling to those needing)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr's report to Congress sets in motion a
process that will stretch well into 1999 as lawmakers began
weighing Friday whether President Clinton should be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the Watergate proceedings 24 years ago, lawmakers
lack a modern precedent to guide them in the extraordinary
procedure set in motion Thursday when the House received Starr's
report alleging ``substantial and credible'' grounds for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point we don't know how long anything will take,''
said a House Judiciary Committee aide. ``We don't know what the
time line will be.''
</P>
<P>
   A prolonged congressional recess due to elections in November
have thrown a wrench into the works.
</P>
<P>
   A conservative estimate is that the process will drag into next
summer, provided the Judiciary Committee _ the panel that will take
up the independent counsel's findings _ determines the evidence
detailed in the report warrants conducting its own inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's 445-page report, which centers around Clinton's sexual
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, alleges 11
possible grounds for impeachment, including perjury, obstruction of
justice, witness tampering and abuse of power in an effort to
conceal the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is only in the nascent stages of the impeachment
process. The chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., is awaiting a
ruling by the House Rules Committee and a vote by the full House
next week that would establish how much investigative power to
grant his committee.
</P>
<P>
   After the powers are established, one of the panel's first acts
related to impeachment will be to consider whether to make public
other material supplied by Starr such as grand jury testimony and
audio tapes. The panel of 21 Republicans and 15 Democrats will make
its recommendation to the full House by Sept. 28, which then will
vote on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent to that, panel lawmakers and the professional
committee staff will conduct a preliminary inquiry, possibly behind
closed doors. Essentially, they will review Starr's report and the
3,000-plus pages of supporting documentation and the 73-page White
House rebuttal to determine whether to launch formal impeachment
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The preliminary inquiry is going to take a matter of weeks
anyway,'' said a committee aide.
</P>
<P>
   If the panel votes for an investigation, the full House of
Representatives would have to agree.
</P>
<P>
   But the congressional elections in November will delay the
process. Congress is scheduled to adjourn Oct. 9 so members can
return home to campaign and was not planning to reconvene until
January.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is discussion on Capitol Hill of Congress
returning after adjournment in a lame-duck session if Hyde's panel
votes for a full impeachment inquiry. Such an inquiry in all
probability wouldn't get under way until next year, when the new
Congress is sworn in.
</P>
<P>
   An inquiry likely would last several months. In 1974, the
Judiciary Committee took seven months to investigate President
Richard Nixon using the voluminous findings of special prosecutor
Leon Jaworski as a guide.
</P>
<P>
   A simple majority of the Judiciary Committee must agree on what
are called ``articles of impeachment,'' the equivalent of
indictments. A single article is sufficient to remove the president
from office. A majority in the House must concur.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Rules Committee can limit debate, the House could
take several weeks debating any articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   During the Nixon proceedings, the House planned for two weeks of
debate, but Nixon resigned before the chamber took up the
impeachment measure.
</P>
<P>
   If the full House votes to impeach Clinton, the Constitution
then requires that the matter move to the Senate, which would
conduct a trial. Chief Justice William Rehnquist would preside as
judge and the 100 Senators would act as a jury. A vote of
two-thirds of the Senate would be required to remove Clinton from
office.
</P>
<P>
   How long would such a trial last? Prior to Nixon's resignation,
lawmakers at the time were planning for a trial of about two to
three months.
</P>
<P>
   No president has ever been expelled from office, but the House
passed a resolution of impeachment against Andrew Johnson in 1868.
The Senate acquitted him by one vote.

   The downloads were slow, the error messages were many, but in
the first experiment in electronic communication between the U.S.
government and its citizens on a massive scale, millions of
persevering Internet users were devouring the Starr report Friday
within hours of its release.
</P>
<P>
   Across cyberspace, the response ran the gamut: ``Impeach the
hypocrite!'' demanded the subject line of an America Online message
board. ``Keep this President!'' came the immediate reply.
</P>
<P>
   Many readers simply quoted the most salacious details, and at
length. But political activists who have been promoting the
Internet as a tool for more participatory democracy said the
release of the report online was a watershed whose implications
went beyond the current scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole universe of information waiting for the public
to discover on the Internet,'' said Kim Alexander of the California
Voter Foundation. ``Maybe this will lead people to realize that
this is a way to become more engaged and involved in public life in
this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Many sites on the World Wide Web reported huge spikes in traffic
as people who had been listening to pundits and politicians
speculate about the investigation for months stampeded the Internet
to find out for themselves what the special prosecutor had to say.
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC, one of the leading news sites on the Web, said 2 million
users had visited the site even before the report was published,
double its previous record set when President Clinton testified
before the grand jury in August. The Washington Post's Web site
reported that its traffic had tripled by late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Despite preparations for logistical nightmares _ news
organizations did not know until Friday morning what format the
report would be delivered in or whether it would need to be scanned
from paper _ the electronic publication process appeared to go
smoothly. Yahoo, a popular gateway to the World Wide Web, received
the report from Congress via the Internet at 2:50 p.m. and
published it five minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes after that, its message boards were flooded with
comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, let me get this straight, you went through the report and
thought this was the most damning and critical evidence against
Clinton?'' demanded one Yahoo user in reply to another who had
posted a passage about Monica Lewinsky's testimony regarding oral
sex. ``Ahahahah. But it isn't about sex??''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the refrains in the online debate was whether the
report was about sex or substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surprise, surprise, surprise, it's all about sex and covering
it up,'' wrote an America Online user. ``Is this what all you
Republicans were waiting for?''
</P>
<P>
   But others had a different take: ``YOU THINK YOU ARE ABOVE THE
LAW,'' another America Online denizen shouted a message to the
president in all caps. ``WE GAVE YOU A JOB TO DO AND YOU HAVE LET
US ALL DOWN.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Americans across the country tried to participate in this
unprecedented kind of electronic town hall meeting, many were shut
out because of the overload on the computer network. Keynote
Systems, a San Mateo, Calif., company that monitors Internet
traffic, said that half of those who tried to connect to the major
news sites received error messages Friday afternoon.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Library of Congress' Thomas Web site had an
average access time of 10 seconds and 98 percent of all requests
for pages were successful. On Friday morning Thomas started out
with a 55-second response time and only 13 percent of attempts to
connect were successful, according to the San Mateo firm.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Internet activists noted that many of the other events
that have caused Internet traffic jams have had little to do with
politics. The death of Princess Diana, the Olympics, the Mars
Pathfinder mission and, most recently, the stock market's gyrations
have slowed the network.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows that the Internet is now the choice medium for
distributing information to the public,'' said Jerry Berman,
chairman of the Center for Democracy and Technology. ``One benefit
is that the Internet is unmediated. There's no one interpreting the
material, so citizens can make their own interpretations. On the
other hand, the material does require context, and what we're going
to have to look at is whether it can provide that, too, and allow
people to make intelligent judgments.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some 100 million people worldwide are now believed to
have Internet access, the publishing of the Starr report raises
thorny questions about inequality of access _ just who has it, and
to what they have access.
</P>
<P>
   Several Internet rating and filtering services said Friday that
the Starr report would be blocked to minors under their
family-content criteria. And a recent Department of Commerce report
found that a ``digital divide'' based on race and income appeared
to be increasing.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the long-term effect that the Starr report
might have on a populace already disenchanted with the political
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can put all the information we want on the Internet,'' said
Ms. Alexander of the California online advocacy group. ``But if
people are so cynical and apathetic that they have no incentive to
look at it, it's not going to make politics better.''

STUDY FINDS TREATMENT HELPS ADDICTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (lb) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Offering new evidence that treating drug addicts works in the
long term, a government survey has reported that addicts who
undergo treatment are considerably less likely to consume drugs or
commit crimes to support their use, even after five years.
</P>
<P>
   Adolescents were the conspicuous exception. Their overall drug
use did not drop significantly after treatment, the study said, and
the number who smoked crack cocaine and abused alcohol actually
rose.
</P>
<P>
   But adolescents have also been identified as the highest
risk-taking age group, while adults tend to quit using drugs as
they get older. The new survey confirmed that older people were
more likely to curtail drug use and criminal behavior than younger
ones. It also reported that women responded better to treatment
than men.
</P>
<P>
   The national survey, which was released on Wednesday by the
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration of the
Department of Health and Human Services, surveyed 1,799 people five
years after their discharge from drug-abuse treatment programs in
1989 and 1990. Their responses on drug use were verified using
urinalysis for traces of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Relapse often occurs after treatment, but the study found that
the number of people using any illicit drug dropped by 21 percent.
The number of powder cocaine users decreased by 45 percent, while
the number of crack smokers decreased by just 17 percent. The
number of heroin users went down by 14 percent and marijuana users
by 28 percent. The number of those using alcohol declined by 14
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Addicts who were treated with methadone, a synthetic heroin
blocker, showed the most significant drop. Twenty-seven percent of
those surveyed stopped using heroin.
</P>
<P>
   As for criminal behavior, the study reported that 56 percent
fewer addicts stole cars and 38 percent fewer committed burglaries
after completing treatment. The number of prostitutes and their
procurers declined by 30 percent, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the retired Army general who is the White
House's director of national drug policy, called the newest study
``extremely important'' in showing that treatment was
cost-effective.
</P>
<P>
   In looking at what happened to graduates of treatment programs,
McCaffrey said in a telephone interview: ``You'd expect some pretty
bad results. Instead, you find that you've got a significant drop
in drug-using behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Though federal spending for treatment has increased 33 percent
since the 1993 fiscal year, the government continues to spend far
more to interdict and seize drugs and arrest and imprison dealers
and addicted felons. According to the White House's 1998 National
Drug Control Strategy, drug treatment is available for barely 52
percent of the Americans who immediately need it.
</P>
<P>
   The survey released on Wednesday is formally called the Services
Research Outcomes Study and was conducted by the National Opinion
Research Center at the University of Chicago. McCaffrey is sure to
cite it in his effort to persuade Congress to approve the
administration's requests for $200 million more in drug-treatment
financing and for another $85 million to treat addicted offenders
caught in the criminal justice system. The requests, for the 1999
fiscal year, have been blocked in congressional committee.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This is a litmus test of rational drug policy,'' said
McCaffrey, who said he would join the Secretary of Health and Human
Services, Donna Shalala, in lobbying Congress for more treatment
money.
</P>
<P>
   Camille Barry, the acting director of the government's Center
for Substance Abuse Treatment, said the study confirmed the
long-term effectiveness of drug treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that the longer you stay in treatment the better the
outcome,'' Ms. Barry said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet 58 percent of the people surveyed had undergone treatment
for the first time and 44 percent had spent a month or less in a
treatment programs. ``To have the results come out the way they did
is very positive,'' Ms. Barry said.

OFFICEMAX TALKS MERGER WITH MYSTERY PARTNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OfficeMax Inc. said Friday it is engaged in talks about a
possible ``business combination,'' but analysts said they doubted
those discussions are with either of the company's larger rivals,
Staples Inc. or Office Depot Inc.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Staples, based in Westborough, Mass. and
ranked No. 2 among office supply superstores, declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read the (OfficeMax) press release, and we never comment
about such matters,'' said Elizabeth Allen of Staples.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Schweikhart, a spokesman for Office Depot, ranked as the
largest chain in the field, also would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   But after the fierce Federal Trade Commission objections that
blocked last year's proposed $10 billion Staples-Office Depot
merger, any combination among the industry's big three ``is very
unlikely,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Burnett, an analyst with Merger Insight in New York,
added: ``They wouldn't be that stupid. The FTC would just dust off
the old complaint.''
</P>
<P>
   More likely, a deal may be in the works involving an overseas
office supply company, to avoid antitrust implications, Jeff
Stinson, Midwest Research Inc. analyst, told Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   Alternately, Daniel Binder, analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP;
Co., told Bloomberg he believed Office Max might be interested in
joining up with a catalog distributor of office supplies or
computers, as Office Depot did earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   OfficeMax said its terse announcement was prompted by unusual
trading in its stock this week. The company said a program begun
earlier this summer to repurchase shares has been halted because
ongoing ``preliminary discussions respecting a possible business
combination'' would make further buying ``inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   With no other details offered, trading in OfficeMax continued to
escalate, with shares closing Friday on the New York Stock Exchange
at 11, up 2 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Office Depot closed at 22 1/8, up 5/16, in New York trading.
Staples closed at 27 5/16, up 1 15/16, on Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   OfficeMax is based in Shaker Heights, Ohio, and according to its
most recent public reports, operates 762 stores.
</P>
<P>
   Office Depot, with headquarters in Delray Beach, Fla., has 631
stores and a large wholesale catalog division. Staples has 830
stores and sells also by mail order.

THE EMMYS: THE LONGEST NIGHT ON TV 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Television will observe 50 years of Emmy awards with an Emmy
awards program that's sure to seem 50 years long.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 50th Annual Prime-Time Emmy Awards'' is scheduled to run
four hours on NBC Sunday night. That means that even if it finishes
on time, it'll be the longest Emmy show ever.
</P>
<P>
   I believe that when the telecast reaches a record-smashing three
hours and 51 minutes, the show will pause. At that point, producer
Don Mischer will circle the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles,
high-five audience members and hug the family of Roger Maris.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no host. Mischer believes that hosts aren't all
heavenly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hosts can be great,'' he said in a recent interview, ``but
also when things tend to go wrong, it's almost always in the host
area, because hosts have to be serviced.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy enough. Call for Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   I'm soooo sorry.
</P>
<P>
   We will see legions of presenters, asked by Mischer to recall
``something personal about television,'' and a laundry list of
50th-anniversary special segments.
</P>
<P>
   Mischer was anticipating a feature about series finales, several
man-on-the-street pieces with common folks talking about how TV has
ruined their lives _ no, excuse me, how TV has influenced their
lives _ and a humorous look back at some of TV's greatest gaffes.
</P>
<P>
   Remember ``Misfits of Science,'' with a 7-foot-4 vegetable man,
a rock musician who flung 20,000 volts from his fingertips and a
teenage girl who could levitate cars? And they were all going to
save the world? And NBC almost included a flying dog that shot
sparks from its butt?
</P>
<P>
   Well, that would be what they consider a TV mistake.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of all this breast-beating about 50 years of Emmy
awards, someone might recall that the first Emmy, back in 1948, was
won by Los Angeles TV personality Shirley Dinsdale. And her puppet
Judy Splinters.
</P>
<P>
   Dinsdale is still around. Judy Splinters, in all likelihood,
needs servicing.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes, the awards. It's no use guessing who'll win them,
because either your loyal TV critic is invariably wrong or the
Academy of Television Arts and Sciences is as predictable as a
truck full of monkeys.
</P>
<P>
   So instead, here's a short list of deserving winners: Garry
Shandling.
</P>
<P>
   He's up, again, for lead actor in a comedy series. Again as in
19 lifetime nominations and not one solitary win. And now, sob,
``The Larry Sanders Show'' has gone the way of ``It's Garry
Shandling's Show.''
</P>
<P>
   All right, a longer list. Calista Flockhart for lead actress in
a comedy series. That's right, ``Ally McBeal'' is officially a
comedy series. We're not guessing officially, mind you, but Helen
Hunt probably has a leg up in this category. She already won an
Oscar this year.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Lahti of ``Chicago Hope'' for lead actress in a drama
series, and for God's sake don't give her a bathroom pass.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Braugher of ``Homicide: Life on the Street'' for lead
actor in a drama. But when it comes to Braugher and ``Homicide,''
the academy never listens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armistead Maupin's More Tales of the City'' for outstanding
miniseries, though Tom Hanks' ``From the Earth to the Moon'' is the
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don King: Only in America'' for best TV movie, because it
crackled like an electrical storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Larry Sanders Show'' for outstanding comedy series because
``Frasier,'' if the voters were actually watching, had an off year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Practice'' for outstanding drama series because ``ER,''
``NYPD Blue,'' ``Law &AMP; Order'' and even ``The X-Files'' have become
a little creaky.
</P>
<P>
   One of my few actual predictions is that all of my choices will
lose. Let's face it. It's just possible that I need servicing.

DOW UP FOR THE WEEK AFTER TECHNOLOGY AND FINANCIAL STOCKS RALLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Technology and financial stocks led the market higher
Friday, as a few earnings bright spots showed through the fanfare
surrounding the release of the Whitewater independent counsel's
report on President Clinton to Congress and concerns about the
prospects for Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The jump of 179.96 points in the Dow Jones industrial average,
while strong, was not enough to wipe out the loss of 249.48 points
on Thursday or to pull the Dow back into positive territory for the
year.
</P>
<P>
   But the rally did leave the Dow up 2 percent for the week,
breaking a two-week decline of 10.5 percent. It is only the second
week since the Dow reached its peak on July 17 that the indicator
has finished up. The other major market measures, however, recouped
all their Thursday losses, ended higher for the week and are up
about 4 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The rally faltered a little after the release of the report on
Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky, but gained steam in
the afternoon, raising the question of how much impact news of the
report had on the stock market. Investors may have been encouraged
by the apparent lack of any major surprises in the report.
</P>
<P>
   But until there is a clearer idea of Clinton's fate, the
impeachment process will probably be more of an excuse to sell
while the economic outlook here and abroad and the prospects for
corporate earnings in the quarters ahead will provide real
direction to the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue every portfolio manager has to be grappling with is
what is going to happen to earnings,'' said Douglas Cliggott, the
U.S. equity strategist at J.P. Morgan Securities.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, stocks were mixed after sharp declines on Thursday.
The Financial Times index of 100 stocks in Britain dropped 18
points, or nearly 0.4 percent, to 5,118.60, but that was enough to
push the index into negative territory for the year, with a decline
of 0.3 percent. The markets in Germany, France and Italy still have
gains in the teens for the year despite sharp selloffs since
mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   There was a bounce in Latin America, which seemed to get a boost
from the rebound on Wall Street. The Bovespa index in Brazil, which
plunged 15.8 percent on Thursday, jumped 13.39 percent Friday,
while the Mexican market rose 2.16 percent after falling 9.8
percent the day before.
</P>
<P>
   But the market environment is unchanged, with the U.S. economy
still threatened by the turmoil in Asia, the political problems in
Russia and the spread of the global crisis to Latin America. Adding
the new focus on Clinton's future, which will occupy Washington and
the media's attention in the weeks ahead, seems to leave little
fertile ground on which the stock market could build a lasting
rally. But it should add to the volatility, which could damage
investor confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in an environment where the market can't rocket back,''
said Jeffrey Applegate, the chief U.S. strategist at Lehman
Brothers. ``That is why this is not like last October,'' he added,
referring to the swift rebound after the Dow fell 554 points on
Oct. 27. ``You keep getting buffeted.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also argued that things are not as dire as they appear.
``There is no one person in charge,'' he said referring to the
leadership needed to help to contain the crisis and the fact
Clinton and other key world leaders seem distracted or incapable.
``But the view that nobody is doing nothing is just wrong,'' he
said. ``I don't think that we are going to stand by and let this
crisis push Latin America and even Canada into a recession.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, will be asked
for more details on his and the central bank's intentions when he
testifies before the House Banking Committee on the global outlook
on Wednesday. The record 380.53-point rally in the Dow on Tuesday
was prompted by his indication that the central bank would consider
a rate cut if the foreign drag on the U.S. economy worsened.
</P>
<P>
   His comments, which were made on Sept. 4, have also helped push
the dollar lower as investors think both an economic slowdown here
and a rate cut will make the U.S. currency less attractive. On
Friday, the dollar fell to 130.82 Japanese yen from 134.23 yen on
Thursday; it is down 11.2 percent against the yen since Aug. 11.
While the dollar rose slightly against the German mark Friday, it
is down 6.2 percent since Aug. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Intel jumped 5~, to 84 15/16, after the company
announced late on Thursday that third-quarter sales should be 8
percent to 10 percent higher than those in the second quarter.
Oracle rose 3], to 25{. Also late on Thursday, the company reported
a 30 percent rise in profits for its first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not clear yet if these positive results are a sign
that the technology business is turning around and may, as it did
earlier this year, help lead the entire stock market higher again.
</P>
<P>
   Although analysts said it was risky to extrapolate too broadly
from these companies' reports, they were considered positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're two-thirds to three-fourths of the way through a
down cycle, which means things should stop getting worse,'' said
John Rossi, a managing director at BancAmerica Robertson Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks, which have been among the hardest hit because
of losses in Russia and Latin America, also rallied. American
Express jumped 8~, to 78], after announcing that economic problems
in Asia and other emerging markets were having little impact on
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow, which rose 2.4 percent, finished at 7,795.50. The
broader Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks climbed 28.87, or 3
percent, to 1,009.06, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq index
finished 56.31 points, or 3.6 percent higher, at 1,641.64. The
Russell index of 2,000 of smaller company stocks rose 8.65 points,
or 2.5 percent, to 353.62, ending a seven-week decline of 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the bond market, the price of the 30-year bond fell 21/32, to
104 while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to
5.23 percent from 5.19 percent on Thursday.

DOW CLIMBS AFTER RELEASE OF STARR REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While much of America was gasping at Indepenent
counsel Kenneth Starr's report on President's Clinton affair with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, investors breathed a
sigh a relief there was nothing more in the report than they
expected. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed almost 180
points, most of it after the report's release.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market was extremely oversold and would have rallied on
almost anything,'' said Thomas M. O'Neill, chief investment officer
with Fleet Investment Advisors in Boston, ``But investors were
relieved the report was no worse than they thought it was going to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow rose 179.96 points, or 2.4 percent, to close at 7795.90
with other market measures following suit. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 Index jumped 28.87, or three percent, to close 1009.06. The
Nasdaq Composite Index added 56.31 points, or 3.6 percent, to close
at 1641.64.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cannot take much comfort from stocks' positive
performance. Analysts said that sunny profit forecasts by Intel
Corp. and American Express Co and new statistics indicating
inflation has essentially vanished were behind much of the rise.
They said other financial events during the day -- especially in
the currency markets -- showed just how worried investors and
traders are.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar slipped to a five-month low against the Japanese yen
only one day after it tumbled against the German mark. Currency
traders traced both moves to worries that the Starr report could
lead to Clinton's impeachment and a decision by many investors to
park their savings elsewhere than here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless Clinton resigns, this thing is going to drag on for
months and that's going to weigh on the dollar,'' said Hugh J.
Walsh, senior currency trader with the New York office of the
German Commerzbank. ``He's not going to go quietly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are beginning to shun US investments,'' said Michael A.
Mullaney, a senior portfolio manager with Boston Partners
Management. `They're getting very leery about pledging any capital
in the US marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   In late trading in New York, the US-Japanese exchange rate from
130.80 yen to the dollar from 134.52 Thursday. Earlier in the day,
the day the rate slipped to 129.15 yen to the dollar, its lowest
level since last April. For the week, the dollar lost 2 percent of
its value against the yen and 2.36 percent against the mark.
</P>
<P>
   US bonds prices fell as some investors concluded they might not
be as safe a place as they once thought to park their money. The
30-year Treausry bond fell 10/32, or $3.13 per $1,000 bond, pushing
the yield or market interest rate on them up to 5.22 percents.
Earlier, bond prices fell one point, driving the yield to 5.13
percent, its lowest level since regular sale of the securities
began in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   With Friday's climb, the stock market turned in one of its best
weeks of the year. The Dow ended the week up 2 percent, while the
S&AMP;P and Nasdaq were up 3.6 percent and 4.8 percent respectively.
Most of the gains came Tuesday when investors went on a buying
spree after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan hinted the US
central bank might cut interest rates to ensure continued growth.
The Dow jumped 380 points on the news, its largest one-day point
gain ever.
</P>
<P>
   Many investment professionals spent Friday telling clients that
Clinton's political troubles matter little to the market so long as
Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin remain in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you told me either of them had unhappy home lives, then I'd
start worrying,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, market analysis director
with A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. ``But not this guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``With or without Clinton, it's not going to make any difference
whether you buy an air conditioner or take a vacation, and that's
all the market cares about,'' Goldman said.

FALL ROUNDUP: MORE OF THE SAME FROM NETWORK TV  
 (EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
 SHOWS-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVE WALKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - There is no single overwhelming trend among the new
fall shows from the broadcast networks. There are several, and
they're small and underwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of an invasion of ``X-Files'' copies or ``Friends''
clones, programming phenomena that followed the trend-setting
success of those shows, viewers get a shotgun blast of minitrends
with little apparent precedent.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there are a few new series built around
Irish-American characters. Some observers blame the ``Riverdance''
craze for this turn of events. Yet, there's very little foot
stomping in any of these series, just a lot of cliche-mongering.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, there are Americans of Irish descent who don't have a
cop or a problem drinker in the family. You'd never know that based
on what you'll see this season on shows like ``Trinity,'' ``To Have
and To Hold,'' ``Legacy'' and ``Costello.''
</P>
<P>
   Another surprising trend is the return of the Big Lovable Lug,
or the sudden proliferation of characters that could've been played
by Jackie Gleason, John Goodman or George Wendt.
</P>
<P>
   Show after show features fellows with no apparent concern for
their triglyceride levels. Each of these chaps is big-bellied yet
pleasant, and, oddly, generally capable of attracting babe-alicious
romantic partners. Guard your beer and chicken wings carefully
around one or more of the characters in ``Jesse,'' ``The Army
Show,'' ``Costello,'' ``Living in Captivity,'' ``The Hughleys,''
``DiResta'' and ``The King of Queens.''
</P>
<P>
   Suburban life, in this era and others, is another comedy target.
Single dads are another. And young singles in general are the focus
of several new series. This is prime time, after all, where
characters tend to resemble the lives of the audience most coveted
by advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Following are thumbnail sketches of all of the new network
offerings (newsmagazines not included). Based on preview screenings
of pilots, interview sessions with the stars and producers, and
periscope-in-the-jetstream observations in general, these glimpses
are presented night-by-night, starting with Sunday. To make your
thumbnail surfing a value-packed experience, I've devised a
paradigm-shifting, bar-raising, easy-to-use format.
</P>
<P>
   First comes the title. Then a brief description of the show.
Then (after
 &UR; Debuts) the debut date. (Duh.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally (after the words  &UR; Blurb me) comes a desperate and rather
sad attempt by me to get quoted in promotional advertising on the
networks. Please note that the content of these items is almost
completely unrelated to quality of the shows. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Sunday  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Holding the Baby'' _ Go-getting salesman gets stuck with his
infant son. From such a premise grows tragedy, not comedy. Yet,
this.
</P>
<P>
   (Fox).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Debuts: Already airing. You didn't know?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Blurb me: ``You'll go ga-ga _ then goo-goo _ for ``Holding
the'' ``Baby''!''
</P>
<P>
   ``That 70s Show'' _ Beers (and other stuff) in the basement
during That Awful Decade. A thin idea, fairly well executed. Laura
Prepon, a standout in the ensemble, has considerable star appeal.
</P>
<P>
   (Fox).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Debuts: Already airing. Having a problem with short-term memory
loss, bucko?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Blurb me: ``Shake your booty to the TV and find ``That 70s
Show''!''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Army Show'' _ This, starring David Anthony Higgins from
``Ellen'' as a Big Lug (Mostly Unlikable, though, which is at least
a twist), has something to do with soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   (WB).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Debuts: Tonight.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Blurb me: ``March on over to the TV and find ``The Army
Show''!''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Monday  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys Like Us'' _ A little kid moves in with perpetual adoles
cents. Now ``there's'' a breakthrough concept.
</P>
<P>
   (UPN).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Debuts: Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Blurb me: ``The feel-good movie of the summer! Two thumbs up!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Conrad Bloom'' _ Smells a lot like the recent crop of NBC sit
coms: A pretty star (Mark Feuer stein) works a cool job
(advertising copy writer) in a big city (New York) while pursuing
true love and various semi-comedic situations.
</P>
<P>
   (NBC).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Debuts: Sept 21.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Blurb me: ``You'll fall ``Bloom'' in love with this sexy
sloganeer!''
</P>
<P>
   ``DiResta'' _ Former New York City transit cop John DiResta
stars as a New York City transit cop (and Big Loveable Lug).
Surprisingly, not terrible.
</P>
<P>
   (UPN).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Debuts: Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Blurb me: ``Take the `A' train to ``DiResta''!''
</P>
<P>
   ``The King of Queens'' _ Here's that ``Seinfeld'' sequel
everybody was wondering about, kind of, plus a leading entry in the
Big Lug sweepstakes. Kevin James stars as the Big Lug. Jerry
``George Cos tanza's dad'' Stiller stars as his crabby, nutty,
borderline basket-case father-in-law. Continuity now! (CBS).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Debuts: Sept. 21.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Blurb me: ``Long live ``The King'' ``of Queens''!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hyperion Bay'' _ A semi-soapy revenge-of-the-nerds drama,
which everybody who doesn't write com puter code for a living will
hate.
</P>
<P>
   (WB).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Debuts: Sept. 21.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Blurb me: ``ROM _ don't walk _ to ``Hyperion Bay''!''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer'' _ Proof that drugs are
still a bit of a problem in Hollywood. Set in the madcap (?)
Lincoln White House, this show is scripted as if it comes from the
underside of pre mium cable. And it will go down, very soon, as one
of the all-time strangest TV concepts.
</P>
<P>
   (UPN).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Debuts: Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Blurb me: ``More fun than a night at Ford's Theater!''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brian Benben Show'' _ The former ``Dream On'' (HBO) star
plays a local TV news anchor on the career downslide. There's not a
single likable character on this whole show, which is, nonetheless
and maybe for just that reason, really quite likable.
</P>
<P>
   (CBS).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Debuts: Sept. 21.
</P>
<P>

tell you which one at 10!''

   ``Will &AMP; Grace'' _ Debra Messing (of the underrated,
underwatched 1995 Fox sitcom ``Ned and Stace''y) stars as a
straight woman whose best bud is a gay man (played by Eric
McCormack). You'll love the third wheel, as portrayed by Sean
Hayes, a potential breakout star. This may be one of the few shows
that will earn its preseason hype.

   &UR; Blurb me: ````Grace'' is the word! ``Will,'' too!''
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. Doctors'' _ Combine the SoCal narcissism of ``LA Law''
with the scorched-Earth self-righteous ness of a typical doc-drama,
and you've got a time slot ripe for swift takeover by a
newsmagazine. Actu ally, I kind of like Rick Roberts, the actor who
plays the most idealistic of the four tongue-depressors cen tral to
the story. Maybe it's time to get my meds adjusted.

   ``Costello'' _ An up-from-under tale can be heartwarming and hu
morous, and the star of this one (South Boston stand-up Sue Cos
tello) is a fresh talent, but this appears to be headed for
heartless and irritating. Ugh, unfortunately.
</P>

   &UR; Blurb me: ``Whaddaayawant fromme? Ablurb'r'somethin?''

<P>
   ``Encore! Encore!'' _ Your guess is as good as mine. Supposedly
about an opera star (Nathan Lane) who retires to run a winery. But
NBC hasn't let anyone see this one yet, which is, as any
``Avengers'' fan can tell you, a baaaad sign.

<P>
   The Hughleys'' _ A Black family invades suburban Stuccoville.
Comic D.L Hughley, as the autobio graphical head of the title house
hold, can be quite comic. Eric Allan Kramer plays his neighbor, who
is, of course, a Big Loveable Lug.

   ``Brimstone'' _ Imagine, Fox try ing to cash in on ``The
X-Files'' vibe. This time, Peter Horton plays a bounty hunter from
Hell _ that's really the character, and not some lumpy TV critic
taking descriptive license _ who travels to New York City to round
up demonic escapees. It's all very Old Testament, includ ing the
pacing.

   ``Felicity'' _ A spunky young woman (played by former Mesa
resident Keri Russell) makes a terrible life choice (blowing off
the pre-med track at Stanford to follow some dude to art school in
New York), then makes the most of it. A solid pick-to-click for its
teen target audience, but a lot of grown-ups will have a hard time
caring. And they'll worry about the dreadful example the lead
character sets for their target-teen daughters.

   ``Sports Night'' _ Ever wonder what life behind the scenes might
be like at ESPN? It can't possibly be as funny or cool as imagined
on this terrific new hybrid (which mixes fleeting bits o'
drama-lite with edgy humor). A great cast and the promise of
crackling writing put ``Sports Night'' at or near the top of all
the pre-season polls.

<P>
   ``Charmed'' _ Shannen Doherty, playing one of three sister
witches (the others: Holly Marie Combs and Alyssa Milano) living
under the same roof, returns to the Aaron Spelling fold for a show
that is _ shockingly, stunningly, stupifyingly _ not godawful. In
fact, the pilot zips right along, and this could be a big hit.

   ``Jesse'' _ Christina (``Married'. . . with Children'')
Applegate plays a single-mom barmaid whose dad's a _ cue ``The
Honeymooner's'' theme _ Great Big Lug. Also a bit of a Racist Jerk
Bartender, a twist on the Big Lug theme we all could've done
without. Anyway, Applegate generally transcends the otherwise blah
sitcom-by-numbers setting, and will be protected in this time slot.

<P>
   ``Legacy'' _ Another Irish-American clan, this one running a
Kentucky horse farm sometime in the 1800s. Everything looks great,
especially the horses. In the preview I saw, though, nobody even
attempts an appropriate accent. Maybe they'll dub in the drawls and
brogues. Or maybe the clan immigrated from Ireland by way of Santa
Monica.

</P>
<P>
   ``Buddy Faro'' _ Dennis Farina stars as a time warped P.I., a
Rat Pack throwback stuck in the now. He's great. Co-star Frank
Whaley, as a younger acolyte, has huge potential, too. The pilot
looks way cool, so there's hope for these hepcats.

   ``Trinity'' _ John Wells, one of the brains behind ``ER,''
offers an ensemble drama about an Irish-Catholic family with all
the cliches: One kid's a priest, one's a cop, one's a union leader
(there are other archetypical sibs, but I stopped counting) and
they all drink too much. Still, Wells is one of the few people in
TV who could pull this off.

   ``Brother's Keeper'' _ Where do they keep finding these cute
kids? This one is named Justin Cooper, and he's pretty darn cute.
Also pretty good are the adult leads, William Ragsdale (as the cute
kid's dad and the ``good'' brother) and Sean O'Bryan (as the
``bad'' brother and ``cool'' uncle). As TGIF fare goes, this is
pretty good.

   ``Wind on Water'' _ Bo Derek returns (but not for long, I'll
bet) to relevance as the matriarch of a ranching/surfing/posing
family living in Hawaii. Lee Horsley plays a great bad guy, but the
most memorable line of dialog in this admittedly gorgeous pilot is,
``Wooo!'' Which is emitted repeatedly if not constantly by Bo's
surfer-dude sons and their buds. (NBC).

   ``Fantasy Island'' _ Malcolm McDowell stars as Mr. Roarke in
this frequently hallucinatory remake of the campy 1980s blah, blah,
blah. Producer Barry Sonnenfeld (``Men in Black,'' ``The Addams
Family'') gets credit for the pilot's appealing weirdness, but can
he keep it weird enough to keep it on the air?

   ``Cupid'' _ Jeremy Piven, late of ``Ellen,'' is perfect in the

   WASHINGTON - While the voluminous report by Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel, released publicly on Friday, is the product of
more than a half-dozen authors, much of the editing and writing was
done by two lawyers, one of whom is a published author, according
to the Office of the Independent Council.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Kavanaugh, a Yale-trained lawyer, is something of a Starr
protege, while Stephen Bates, a Harvard graduate, is a lawyer and a
journalist who has written several non-fiction works, including a
well-received book on religion in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Bates, who sources said wrote most of the narrative describing
the relationship between the president and Monica Lewinsky, studied
writing as well as the law.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief interview, Bates declined to say much about his
background, other than his plans to continue working with Starr.
But in some ways, Bates is like Starr, having grown up in Pecos,
Texas, a small town in North Texas ``way out near nowhere,''
according to a friend. And like Starr, he is known for his low-key
and courteous demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Bates graduated from Harvard College in 1982 and Harvard Law
School in 1987. His friends said he was determined to earn his
living as a writer and not as a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   During his final year at Harvard Law School, Bates was accepted
into an advanced fiction writing class of only 10 students _ mostly
undergraduates. He made a lasting impression on his instructor,
Monroe Engel, who said he wrote spare and sensible prose.
</P>
<P>
   ``His was not semi-autobiographical; it was much more
sophisticated, and very non-confessional,'' said Engel, who was the
director of Harvard's creative writing program. ``His work was
fairly highly plotted, and he really had a sense of story and a
good sense of scene.''
</P>
<P>
   After law school, Bates wrote for publications as diverse as The
Nation, the Weekly Standard, Playboy and The New Republic. He is
the author of several books, including ``Battleground: One's Mother
Crusade, the Religious Right, and the Struggle for Control of Our
Classrooms'' (Poseidon Press, 1993) and ``If No News, Send Rumors:
Anecdotes of American Journalism'' (St. Martin's Press, 1989).
</P>
<P>
   Bates, 40, has been described by some journalists and academics
as having a somewhat libertarian bearing, with politics that might
be a little right of center. He and Starr wrote a proposal for a
book, Bridget's Story, that aspired to do for the issue of church
and state what ``Gideon's Trumpet'' did for legal rights for the
impoverished. The book, said Lynn Chu, Bates' literary agent, would
have focused on the case of Bridget Mergens, a high school student
in Omaha, Neb., who was barred from forming a Bible study group at
school. But no publishing house has been interested in the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Bates' ``Battleground'' book earned good reviews; one, by E.J.
Dionne, Jr. of the Washington Post, said: ``No matter where you
stand, Bates' sensitive and well-crafted account of a famous battle
over public education will give you a new angle of vision.
</P>
<P>
   Bates is a part-time employee of the independent counsel's
office and the part-time literary editor of the Wilson Quarterly,
the publication of the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington.
Kavanaugh, 33, is regarded as a rising star in Washington legal
circles . Even though he is one of the youngest members of the
independent counsel's legal team, Starr has entrusted him with some
of the office's most difficult legal issues, in particular the
efforts by the White House to invoke a variety of privileges to
block testimony.
</P>
<P>
   He is a native of the Washington area; his mother is a Maryland
state judge and his father is a lobbyist for the cosmetics
industry. He graduated from Yale in 1987 with a degree in history,
played on several sports teams including the junior varsity
basketball team and was a reporter for the Yale Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   His first job after graduating from Yale College and the Yale
Law School was with Starr, who was then solicitor general.
</P>
<P>
   After joining the independent counsel's office, Kavanaugh led
the investigation into the death of Vincent Foster, a deputy White
House counsel who killed himself in July 1993. Kavanaugh left the
office in 1997 but returned this spring to handle an appeal to the
Supreme Court on an issue that became known as ``postmortem
privilege.'' In that case he argued and lost the case in which the
independent counsel had sought notes taken by Foster's lawyer,
contending that the lawyer-client privilege ended with death.

INSECT PEST FORCES U.S. TO BAN SOME CHINESE IMPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., N.Y.)  (mk) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ To halt the invasion of a devastating insect pest, the
United States said Friday that it would ban the import of all
Chinese goods shipped in raw wood packing material, a move that is
likely to strain China's economy _ as well as U.S.-China relations.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said wooden crates and pallets used to ship Chinese
goods to North America sometimes harbor the comely but voracious
Asian long-horned beetle, which has emerged from the packing
material after it arrived in warehouses to kill trees in five
locations around New York and Chicago in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   The ban is likely to result in delays or higher costs for a
third to half of China's $62 billion in exports to the United
States _ at a time when China has already seen its export growth
slowed by weak economies in other Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials acknowledged during a news conference conducted
by video hookup in Beijing that the restrictions, scheduled to take
effect in 90 days, will cause pain for Chinese business _ and for
American importers as well. But they said that when Agriculture
Department inspectors found the beetles boring through maple trees
in suburban Chicago neighborhoods this summer, they felt compelled
to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very concerned,'' Dr. Isi Siddiqi, deputy assistant
agriculture secretary, said during the news conference. ``These new
regulations are based on sound science and a real threat to U.S.
environmental resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Government studies estimated $138 billion of damage to the U.S.
economy if the beetles, which have no natural enemies in the United
States and cannot be eradicated with pesticides, move to U.S.
forests.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Glickman, the agriculture secretary, said the action should
not be seen as a trade sanction, adding that trade between the
United States and China had grown to $80 billion this year from $5
billion 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intention here is not to disrupt trade, but to lock out an
unwanted guest that poses a serious economic and environmental
threat,'' Glickman told an audience in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations require that goods from China be packed in
non-wood packing material or wood that has been treated with heat
or fumigation to kill the insects. It was not clear whether Chinese
exporters would be able to adopt new practices in the next 90 days
or how much their costs would rise.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Chinese government had no official comment on the
ban, Chinese officials have been aware of the looming possibility
for weeks and were hoping to avert it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the ban is imposed, China's exports will suffer, because a
considerable amount of our export trade is packed in raw wood,''
one Agriculture Ministry official said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government has recently issued billions of dollars
in Treasury bonds in an effort to stimulate the economy and
insulate it against a slowdown caused by economic crises elsewhere
in Asia or the summer's devastating floods in China. Although
China's exports are still growing, the rate of growth has slowed
this year, and a reduction of its thriving export sales to the
United States would be hard to bear.
</P>
<P>
   Siddiqi said the U.S. government had been discussing the problem
with China's quarantine agency for many months, ever since the
beetles were discovered in warehouses. He stressed that the United
States hoped to cooperate with the Chinese to minimize disruption
to trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, this is not an action we wanted to take, but this bug is
eating trees in people's back yards and their front yards,'' said
one U.S. official in Beijing. ``Inspectors from the Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service are knocking on doors and saying,
`We have to cut down all the trees around your home.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the beetles have so far been detected in
wood packing from China in warehouses in 14 states. They have been
found free in the environment in and around Chicago as well as in
Brooklyn and Amityville, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The beetle was identified as the Asian long-horned beetle by a
Cornell University entomologist, Richard Hoebeke, after Brooklyn
residents noticed mysterious half-inch holes in their trees. The
beetle's larvae drill through trees' bark into the wood, where they
undergo metamorphosis into large black beetles with bright white
spots and long elegant antennae.
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn, as in three subsequent infestations, inspectors had
to order the destruction of all affected trees, since there is
currently no other way to control the pests.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials disagreed somewhat over just how much of China's
exports were packed in untreated wood, with estimates ranging from
30 percent to more than 90 percent, and on how difficult it would
be for Chinese to adjust to the new requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Ma Zhongmei, an official at the export department of North China
Air Transportation Co. in Beijing, said about one-third of her
company's customers packed their goods in raw wood. She added that
this sort of packing was most commonly used for high value items,
like large machines and factory equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``These customers could have used plywood, but they chose raw
wood to reduce cost,'' she said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A day as ominous as it was extraordinary took a
jagged tangent Friday as the House finished its furiously partisan
face-off on the question of impeaching President Clinton.
Instantly, the capital's focus, like the nation's, shifted to a
long salacious journey down the information highway.
</P>
<P>
   The radio of Manhatt Bahia, a flower dealer three blocks down
Pennsylvania Avenue from the Capitol, suddenly blared forth an
early bulletin, the words spilling like mercury across the
sidewalk: ``And the Starr report vividly describes several sex acts
that that some people might consider unusual!''
</P>
<P>
   Bahia blinked in absorbing the details, his hands clasped steady
on his cane. ``And the odds are one-point-seven-eight trillion to
one that the semen is the president's!'' the bulletin concluded and
the flower dealer only nodded slowly in acknowledgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton will bounce back,'' Bahia declared. ``Everything is
premature,'' he insisted, resisting the enormous vector of
accusation and humiliation directed at the president across a
blistering day for the history books.
</P>
<P>
   Other government business moved forward, but one item seemed
ludicrous in the context of the day's agenda as the House
subcommittee on trade and consumer protection held a hearing on
``protecting children from inappropriate material on the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The vases of Bahia's colorful flowers arrayed on the sidewalk
was one of the few grace notes in a Capitol day given over to a
fury of partisan cut-and-thrust and dizzying absorption of the
Chaucerian details of the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   Over the Democrats' vehement objections, Republican speakers
repeatedly showed their wariness that, to yield the president even
an hour's advance look at the Starr report would give him
Houdini-like room to ``spin'' some masterful escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are unwilling to give you a public-relations advantage any
greater than the one you have had for the past eight months,''
declared Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who will take the helm of any
impeachment inquiry. Although he has received bipartisan praise for
his anticipated statesmanship in such a role, Hyde did not shy from
a tooth-and-claw rebuttal when the Democrats riled him.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' outcry was intense, but the final lop-sided vote
showed most of them unable to resist the release of the report,
poised as it was on the threshhold of the Internet with its tales
of presidential sex and mendacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Find a rope, find a tree and ask a bunch of questions later!''
boomed Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., angrily warning of ``a
political lynch mob.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Whip Tom DeLay would have none of that. ``The
president is no better than any other American,'' he told the
Democrats, surveying them with a a hard-edged stare and belittling
the explanations and apologies of the president as ``the spin, the
whole spin and nothing but the spin.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, press secretary Mike McCurry tried to
weather a storm of reporters questions, and had to pause when he
was asked, ``Is this the saddest day of the Clinton presidency?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McCurry thought for a minute, then came up with the ultimate
alternative _ ``the days on which we've dealt with the tragic
deaths of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Woeful as the day was for Democrats, many feared the worst was
yet to come as individual members of the Judiciary Committee are
now free for two weeks to pore over _ perchance to leak _ the
report's still secret appendix of 2,600 pages of more detailed and
intimate information. ``This information will leak out drip by
drip, day by day,'' said Rep. John Moakley, D-Mass., warning the
nation of a nightmare of grim titilation to come.
</P>
<P>
   As the impeachment question loomed, the House was cautioned by a
veteran congressman, Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., that the welfare of
all politicians, Republican and Democrat, would be put at stake in
a gruelling constitutional ordeal. ``I was here during Watergate,''
Obey said gloomily. ``I hated it, because it bittered up the
politics of the entire country.''
</P>
<P>
   After authorizing the Internet launch of the report, lawmakers
quickly poured down the steps of the Capitol into the day's
sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton had such tremendous potential,'' said a tourist,
Newton Stafford of Escondido, Calif., a Clinton supporter whose
regret inched toward eulogy.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Geraldine, sadly told him, ``Men with political power
are very attractive to women: it's a double whammy.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple watched the emerging politicians steadily work
enormous lines of television crews from across the nation, foraging
for air time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you?'' one reporter demanded of Sen. Arlen Specter,
R-Pa., who had detoured over from the Senate chamber, took no
offense and genially offered his name and a volley of sound bites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm going to read,'' the senator concluded, beaming as he
departed towards his office to delve into the sordid details of the
day.

action, public reaction and congressional reaction. (Shepard, Cox
News Service).
</P>
<P>
   REPORT-SEX _ WASHINGTON _ The reported ``salacious details'' in
the report, if they erode President Clinton's standing among a
shocked public, may have greater power to shake his hold on office
that the charges of perjury and other impeachable offenses.
(Nesmith, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   With REPORT-SEXADDICT _ WASHINGTON _ Even before details of
President Clinton's extramarital sexual activity were made public,
some mental health professionals have concluded that the cravings
that supposedly steamed up the Oval Office are those of a ``sex
addict.'' Other psychotherapists caution that understanding the
mental underpinnings of human behavior _ or even learning exactly
what happened _ usually takes hours of one-on-one exchange between
patient and therapist. (Nesmith, Cox News Service 950).

   MOVED in (w) Washington and (l) lifestyle categories.

   REPORT-CLINTON _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton acknowledged
Friday that ``I have sinned'' and extended his apology to Monica

   REPORT-ANALYSIS _ WASHINGTON _ How is the Lewinsky scandal like
Watergate? For one thing, it shows again that the cover-up is worse

   REPORT-BATES _ WASHINGTON _ To help write the investigative
report to Congress that the world is finally reading, Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr has turned to a soft-spoken literary lawyer
who shares his small-town Texas roots. Unlike the hard-bitten
career prosecutors who make up most of the team that has
investigated President Clinton for four years, Stephen Bates was
recruited as much for his talents as a scholarly wordsmith as for
his legal skills as a Harvard-educated attorney. (Dart, Cox News

   DDN-COX-PRAYER: When Clinton opened the religious prayer
breakfast today, he said a Jewish prayer for atonement. We check

community thinks and try to see what local pastors are going to say
from the pulpit on Sunday. (Kline, Dayton Daily News)

<P>
   DDN-COX-SCHOOL: The crisis unfolding in Washington is history in
the making. So we visit a Centerville High School honors government
class to hear the conversations, issues and concerns over our
American govenment, because to them- this is their equivalent to
Watergate. (Fisher, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   MONICA-FLU _ The public's disgust with President Clinton's
affair may mean Democrats stay home on Election Day while outraged
Republicans turn out in higher numbers, political pollsters said.
One Republican Capitol Hill aide called it ``Monica flu.'' ``That
turnout effect may have a devastating effect on local Democrats,''
said John Green, a political science professor at the University of
Akron. (Bischoff/Montgomery, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

   RUSSIA-CRISIS-0911 _ MOSCOW _ Prime Minister Yvegeny Primakov
was confirmed Friday by parliament, ending Russia's three-week
political crisis. But concerns turned to the country's economic
turmoil and how the new government will deal with it. President
Boris Yeltsin on Friday appointed communist and former central
banker Viktor Geraschenko to again lead the central bank. He was
blamed for printing print money and creating hyper-inflation in
Russia in 1993. It prompted Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs to call
Geraschenko ``the worst central banker in the world.'' (Holmes, Cox

   LATAM-ECONOMY-0911 _ MIAMI _ Fears are rising that Latin
America's economic leader, Brazil, will be pushed into a massive
devaluation. Such a move would have a domino effect across the
entire region. Local shares in Brazil took their biggest one-day
plunge in 11 years on Thursday. What happens in Latin America will

Jamaica's known for its stunning beaches and plush resorts, but
being near the water and sipping margaritas aren't all there is to

attracting a growing number of travelers. And, Jamaica boasts one
of the Caribbean's most unique attractions: the Rocklands Feeding
Station in the village of Anchovy, just a short drive from Montego
Bay. At the station, home to 93-year-old ornithologist Lisa Salmon,
visitors can feed all sorts of wild birds from the palms of their
hands. Visitors can also hunt for butterflies -- Jamaica is home to
the largest butterfly in the Americas. So, you don't have to go to

   CARIBBEAN-CRIME-$ADV12 _ PARADISE ISLAND, Bahamas _ It's called
paradise, but this island is having a hard time living up to its
name. In the past two weeks, three foreigners have been murdered
here, including a young American school teacher. The latest murder
occured on Sept. 2 when a man who worked on Carnival Cruise Line's
Fantasy ship was shot to death during a robbery. No one's been
accused of the crimes and so, according to the headlines, there's a
``Killer On The Loose.'' But the Bahamas is not only plagued by
rising crime, it's also awash with drugs, mostly cocaine. During
the first three months of 1998, officials seized more cocaine than
in the previous three years combined. All this hardly bodes well
for the reputation of the Bahamas, or for the winter months, the
biggest season for tourists in the Caribbean. The Bahamian islands
host 3 million tourists each year, and rely on tourists for 70
percent of their income. (Emling, Cox News Service).

CAMBODIA DEMONSTRATORS ARE ATTACKED BY PRO-GOVERNMENT THUGS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ A band of pro-government thugs beat and
shot at opposition demonstrators Friday and the military warned of
stronger action, saying it could not allow what it called the
``worrying anarchy'' of the continuing opposition protests.
</P>
<P>
   One person was shot dead and several others were beaten and shot
when they were attacked by teen-age toughs carrying wooden sticks
and flying the banner of the government party led by Hun Sen, the
country's strongman.
</P>
<P>
   The toughs were commanded by older men on motorbikes with
two-way radios and pistols who appeared to be plainclothes security
men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police have been ordered not to intervene, just to protect
certain places,'' said Khieu Kanharith, the government spokesman.
``We have only ordered the ambulances to be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   But, like the riot police who have shot and clubbed protesters
on the previous four days, these organized vigilantes withdrew in
the afternoon, leaving the streets open to thousands of chanting
opposition demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the day, however, the military chief of staff, Gen. Ke
Kim Yan, issued what some opposition figures took to be a warning
of a final crackdown after nearly three weeks of protests by the
losers of a parliamentary election in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``The armed forces will implement their duty to protect the
constitution and the supreme interest of our country and people,''
Ke Kim Yan said. He described as ``criminal activities'' the
protests launched by the two main opposition leaders, Prince
Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy.
</P>
<P>
   The two men are protesting Hun Sen's victory in the election,
saying it was marred by fraud and intimidation. They have
threatened to boycott the opening of parliament later this month
and to paralyze the formation of a new government.
</P>
<P>
   In his strongest political statement since the election, King
Norodom Sihanouk, a constitutional monarch who is the father of
Prince Ranariddh, warned the two men not to carry out that threat.
</P>
<P>
   If they do, the king said, they and their elected party members
would not be recognized as parliamentary representatives and would
lose the legal immunity that protects them from arrest.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``You may be in great danger and I will not be in a position to
protect you,'' the king said.
</P>
<P>
   After two hand grenades exploded at his residence Monday, Hun
Sen threatened all opposition members with arrest and barred them
from leaving the country. Ranariddh has withdrawn from public view
and Sam Rainsy has taken refuge with the United Nations
representative here.
</P>

 &HT;    LAWYERS DENY STARR CHARGES ARE IMPEACHABLE OFFENSES
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ White House lawyers Friday countered Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr's report to Congress with a 78-page rebuttal
arguing that President Clinton has broken no laws and that his
admitted sexual misconduct does not rise to an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after Clinton tearfully acknowledged wrongdoing but
vowed to ``mount a vigorous defense,'' the lawyers assailed the
motives driving Starr's investigation and the 450-page report that
appeared in lurid detail on Capitol Hill and on Internet sites in
the early afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The salacious allegations in this report are simply intended
to humiliate, embarrass and politically damage the president,''
David E. Kendall, the president's private attorney, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president did not commit perjury, he did not obstruct
justice, he did not tamper with witnesses, and he did not abuse the
power of his office,'' Kendall said, ticking off the charges
outlined in the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   While the lawyers repeatedly acknowledged that Clinton had erred
in having a sexual relationship with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky, the lawyers said that the wrongs were ``private''
ones that do not meet the the ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' test
that the Constitution sets for impeaching a president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's legal team also would not say the president was
prepared to accept a lesser rebuke, such as a congressional
censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's any pain inflicted, it's happened,'' said Charles
Ruff, the White House counsel, when asked if the president would
accept a punishment from Congress short of impeachment. ``We're not
talking about formally reaching out and imposing more pain on the
president than he's already imposed on himself.''
</P>
<P>
   In launching their effort to stave off impeachment, his
attorneys took their lead from Clinton, who at a morning prayer
breakfast said, ``I will instruct my lawyers to mount a vigorous
defense, using all available appropriate arguments.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the White House legal team had complained that they had
no advance look at the report, they nonetheless were prepared with
their response, based on news leaks and their own
information-sharing with many of the more than 70 witnesses who
testified before Starr's grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   In the response to the allegations, the lawyers repeatedly
conceded much of the questionable behavior. They acknowledged
Clinton's efforts to obscure facts and mislead when he denied that
he had had sexual relations with Lewinsky in a sworn deposition in
the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit last Jan. 17.
</P>
<P>
   But that answer did not amount to perjury, they said, because of
the highly technical way Clinton was interpreting the term ``sexual
relations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If answers are truthful or literally truthful but misleading,
there is no perjury as a matter of law, no matter how misleading
the testimony is or is intended to be,'' the legal memorandum said.
``The law simply does not require the witness to aid his
interrogator.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if that standard of truthfulness is too low for a
president, Kendall said that Clinton's response was justified
because the Jones case against him was ``a highly charged lawsuit
for political means.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the White House disputed contentions that Clinton had
tried to influence Lewinsky's testimony in the Jones case. ``I
don't think there was any concealment story concocted here
whatsoever,'' Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers also dismissed allegations that Clinton had
attempted to tamper with a witness when he summoned his secretary,
Betty Currie, to work on the Sunday, Jan. 18, the morning after his
Paula Jones case deposition, and quizzed her about whether he had
been alone with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall told reporters that Clinton was not trying to steer a
witness because Currie had not been called as a witness for any
case at the time. Currie was later called before the Starr grand
jury.
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps the most forcefully expressed arguments, the White
House lawyers rejected the Starr report's suggestion that the
president had abused his powers by using his government lawyers and
staff to cover up his relationship with Lewinsky by filing legal
appeals to keep aides from testifying.
</P>
<P>
   The White House rebuttal called that a legal use of presidential
powers. And as for permitting his staff to perpetuate lies, the
lawyers argued, in essence, that that is standard procedure:
</P>
<P>
   ``If allowing aides to repeat misleading statement is a crime,
then any number of public officials are guilty of misusing their
office for as long as they fail to admit wrong doing in response to
any allegation about their activities.''

THE WELLES WAY TO `TOUCH OF EVIL'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Like most of Orson Welles' work, ``Touch of
Evil'' needed rescuing.
</P>
<P>
   The last feature Welles directed in America, the 1958 film noir
has been widely admired for 40 years, even considered his most
completely realized Hollywood film outside of ``Citizen Kane.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet none of the three versions of ``Touch of Evil'' that have
circulated over the decades have quite accurately reflected Welles'
vision. But now, working from a 58-page memo Welles wrote after
seeing Universal Studios' cut of ``Evil'' shortly before its
release, producer Rick Schmidlin and Oscar-winning editor and sound
expert Walter Murch have created the closest thing to Welles' ideal
concept as could reasonably be executed.
</P>
<P>
   And, believe it or not, the original movie maverick's plan
turned out to be more audience-friendly than the skittish studio's
approach ever was.
</P>
<P>
   ``After three weeks of cutting the film piece by piece, Walter
and I watched it for the first time from beginning to end,'' says
Schmidlin, a film historian and producer who's worked primarily in
the documentary field. ``We didn't know if it was going to be more
artistic, quirkier or really incoherent, as the studio thought it
was. But what we found was a more commercially accessible movie _
an easier movie to follow, where the plot points were made much
clearer than they had previously been.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was all that Welles was asking for. He was asking for
clarification to make this film play, not more confusing or arty.
He wanted everybody to enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Universal's jitters were understandable (if, in the long run,
inexcusable). Wallowing in sleaze and psychic darkness, ``Evil''
was a tough sell even in the heyday of B exploitation movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orson addressed all sorts of things in the movie before it was
really fashionable to do so,'' notes co-star Janet Leigh, who
played Susan Vargas, the new wife of a Mexican narcotics cop whose
border-town honeymoon is interrupted by a series of harrowing
events orchestrated by Welles' corpulent, racist and murderously
corrupt police chief, Hank Quinlan. ``The way Quinlan treats
Vargas, having Susan be a modern, feisty woman, bringing in drugs,
gangs, rape, bombs blowing up ... I mean, it's very today, he just
was very ahead of his time.''
</P>
<P>
   At least as alarming as the movie's controversial content was
the filmmaker's reputation. ``Kane,'' Welles' 1941 debut, was then,
like today, recognized as the greatest American movie of all time.
But it had been a commercial underperformer, and the director's
follow-up, ``The Magnificent Ambersons,'' was mangled by RKO far
worse than ``Evil'' ever was while Welles, when he should have been
in Hollywood defending his cut, was romping in Rio.
</P>
<P>
   This was the beginning of a depressing pattern: Welles would
shoot a brilliant if difficult film, get disheartened in the
post-production phase, then leave the country while the studio did
reshoots and made its own cut.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Universal was thrilled about that prospect, either. In
fact, although the studio was happy to have him play Quinlan, it's
doubtful Welles would have gotten the ``Evil'' directing assignment
if the biggest actor of the era had not quietly insisted on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I'm most proud of in my career was
persuading a studio to provide the maker of `Citizen Kane' with the
last film he made in America,'' says Charlton Heston, who played
the incorruptible cop Mike Vargas just after portraying Moses in
``The Ten Commandments'' and two years before winning an Oscar in
``Ben-Hur.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hunting in Michigan during Christmastime, and I took a
couple of scripts along to read. One of them was called `Badge of
Evil' (also the title of the pulp detective novel on which the film
was loosely based). When someone from the studio called to ask what
I thought, I told him I was interested and asked who was directing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `We don't have a director yet. But we have Orson
Welles to play the heavy.' I said, `He's a pretty good director,
y'know.' Then there was an `Um _ yeah _ ``Citizen Kane.''
Interesting idea. We'll get back to you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I know, when I hung up, they didn't say `Gee, that Chuck
Heston is so smart.' They probably went, `Oh Christ, stupid actors.
Well, we don't want him to get sore. How bad can it be?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Pretty great, actually. Welles completely rewrote the dull
script in a few weeks. He hired Russell Metty, a director of
photography who was that rare combination of fast and good, and an
eager and inventive young composer named Henry Mancini. He then
oversaw a fertile rehearsal period in which some of the weirdest
film performances ever registered _ Marlene Dietrich's fatalistic
fortuneteller, Akim Tamiroff's gleefully amoral crime boss, Dennis
Weaver's terrified and totally tetched motel clerk _ were
developed.
</P>
<P>
   And on the first day of shooting, Welles pulled off one of the
most complicated moving shots ever attempted, a one-take
planting-of- and search-for-evidence sequence in a small house
involving some dozen characters and reams of dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   The studio was already nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orson didn't turn a camera on until 2 in the afternoon,''
Heston recalls. ``The studio guys were going nuts. Then he did
about 10, 12 takes. By the time it was nearly 6 o'clock, and we'd
just about blown the whole day, he said, `Cut. Print that. That's a
wrap on this scene, and we are three days ahead of schedule'.''
</P>
<P>
   And that wasn't even ``Evil's'' most celebrated scene. The
justly influential, three-minute-plus opening sequence, filmed just
before dawn in Venice, Calif., follows the planting of a car bomb,
its path across the border into Mexico and subsequent rude
interruption of the newlyweds' evening stroll.
</P>
<P>
   The most noticeable difference between the new cut and previous
versions is that this pre-Steadicam masterpiece of fluid logistics
and camera choreography now appears without distracting
opening-credit titles. They now run at the end of the film proper,
which is actually shorter than earlier versions due to a few quick
cuts made according to the memo's instructions.
</P>
<P>
   While subtle changes in picture editing make relationships
between characters stronger and easier to follow, the film's
soundscape has been much more noticeably altered to reflect Welles'
then-groundbreaking ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to reconstruct the music in the opening of film because
it had to come from various sources,'' explains Schmidlin. ``He
only felt that two basic themes of music should be needed to score
this film, and the rest of it should come from ambient sources:
radios, jukeboxes, room speakers, a pianola. Now, that's basically
what we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Murch used similar sound techniques a generation
after Welles conceived them in his mixes for such films as ``The
Godfather'' and ``American Graffiti'' _ unaware, at the time, that
Welles had thought of them first.
</P>
<P>
   It was this almost extra-sensory attunement to Welles' way of
thinking that convinced Schmidlin he needed Murch, who won both
editing and sound Oscars for ``The English Patient,'' to achieve
Welles' goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know Walter, but I pleaded with him on the phone to
do this,'' Schmidlin admits. ``He knew sound and picture, and
Welles was asking for sound and picture. There wasn't much room for
interpretation (of the memo), but I needed Walter Murch to
understand the intellect of Welles.
</P>
<P>
   The results, though modest compared to many other recent
``director's cut'' reconstructions, are nonetheless profoundly
pleasing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about a restructuring of the whole film,''
Heston notes. ``We're not talking about a wreck that they somehow
put wheels on. I'm delighted with the film as it stands; I was
pleased with the film when we made it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that the studio was fiddling around because we had to
go back and do retakes,'' Leigh recalls. ``Neither of us really
wanted to, but contractually we had to. What they were meant to do
was round this out into a smoother kind of movie, which of course
it was not meant to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw it initially, I liked it, but I did miss some of
the sharpness that should have been there. When I saw the re-edited
version, I was so excited, because I saw the movie that (Welles)
had envisioned, I saw what he meant to say. Which was: This is not
a pretty picture, guys and dolls. This is a tough, rough, mean,
dirty, dark, grimy movie. It wasn't `Mr. Blandings' Dreamhouse';
this was a jab 'em, jar 'em, shake 'em up kind of movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that's what I've seen, and it makes me very happy,'' Leigh
concludes. ``I'm really quite emotional about it.''

CONGRESS HANDS CLINTON A DEFEAT, RELEASES STARR REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a harsh rebuke to President Clinton, the House
voted overwhelmingly Friday to make public an embarrassing
indictment of Clinton's sexual affair with a former White House
intern.
</P>
<P>
   All 224 Republicans joined one independent and 138 Democrats in
agreeing to disclose the report by independent counsel Kenneth
Starr, a document that alleges impeachable offenses and includes
vivid details of the president's affair.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Rep. James P. Moran, one of the 63 Democrats who voted
against posting the document on the Internet, said the lopsided
vote unfortunately indicated ``the lack of support of the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you wanted to read into the vote today, the support of the
president would seem very discouraging,'' Moran said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's 445-page report, which centers around Clinton's sexual
affair with Monica Lewinsky, alleges 11 possible grounds for
impeachment, including perjury, obstruction of justice, witness
tampering and abuse of power in an effort to conceal the
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats argued it was unfair that Clinton didn't get a
chance to see the report in advance. But Republicans said they
didn't see any reason to give the White House an opportunity to
launch an attack on the report before it was made public.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the strongest support for Clinton came from black
members of Congress who argued that public release of the report
would be unfair. They said they can identify with the president
because most of them arrived with a history of facing abuse from
overly aggressive prosecutors and of being treated unjustly in the
legal system.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., who heads the Congressional Black
Caucus, said she and other members of the caucus empathize with
Clinton because they ``came here with a history of understanding
what unfairness is.''
</P>
<P>
   Should the House move to impeach Clinton, Waters said she would
try to ``police'' the proceedings to make sure they are fair, but
added, ``If this president has broken the law and it meets the
criteria for impeachment, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another member of the caucus, Rep. Melvin Watt, D-N.C., said the
president ``has a right not to be tried in the public press.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the public wants this information, but what you're
doing is putting the public's right to know above the charged
party's protection,'' Watt said.
</P>
<P>
   Watt, who opposed making the report public, said Congress was
``reneging on its responsibility'' to conduct a fair process in the
House by releasing the independent counsel's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have an awesome burden as members of the
(Judiciary) committee with you all standing in judgment,'' Watt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, who is both a member of the
caucus and of the House Judiciary Committee, said she thinks the
public ``will be aghast,'' when they read details of Starr's
report. Lee said she would make sure her husband keeps a close eye
their 13-year-old son as he surfs the Internet looking for the
report.
</P>
<P>
   She cautioned parents to ``keep their child under close
supervision'' on the Internet. Ironically, a House panel Friday
morning held a hearing on proposals to protect children from
inappropriate material on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five members of the Black Caucus opposed the public
release, while six supported it.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the caucus who voted for release the report were
Reps. Sanford Bishop, D-Ga.; Julian C. Dixon, D-Calif.; Cynthia
McKinney, D-Ga.; Juanita Millender-McDonald, D-Calif.; Charles B.
Rangel, D-N.Y.; and Albert Wynn, D-Md.
</P>

   Republican leaders, who pressed for public release of the
report, appeared very somber after the vote as they waited to
receive copies of the document.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Linder, R-Ga., chairman of the National Republican
Congressional Committee, said he viewed Friday's vote as the
beginning in a long process toward impeachment, which would occur
``if there is enough in the report that is sufficiently disgusting
to the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us are taking this pretty seriously,'' Linder said. He
said the 363-63 vote showed that Democrats are distancing
themselves from the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hard left is sticking with him,'' Linder said. ``I believe
they will be there to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gerald B.H. Solomon, R-N.Y., the Rules Committee chairman,
said the independent counsel's report ``embarks this institution on
a grave and profound process.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no joy in bringing forward this resolution,'' Solomon
said. ``Only a sense of the gravity of our task ahead and mindful
of our constitutional responsibilities.''

IMF, CENTRAL BANK BOOST BRAZIL'S CURRENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund and Brazil's central bank took
action on two fronts Friday to give relief to a currency buckling
under the growing pressures from investor flight.
</P>
<P>
   Investors this month have pulled their funds out of Latin
America's biggest economy at an alarming pace of $1 billion or more
a day, exchanging the local reais for dollars or other stable
currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Withdrawals slowed to $200 million Friday, economists estimated,
after the central bank raised interest rates by 20 points and the
IMF gave assurances that it would provide reserves to any Latin
American country needing them to protect their currency.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the stopgap measures, devaluation of the reais is still
a danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``For next week, I think Brazil remains prone to shifts in
investor confidence,'' said Felipe Garcia, Latin America economist
for the Manhattan firm, Independent Economic Analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Latin America _ unlike Asia _ is enjoying moderate growth. And
after a recovery from a devaluation of Mexico's peso four years
ago, the region has been held out by the IMF as a model of monetary
and fiscal restraint. But investors burned by a contraction of
Asian economies are growing nervous about Latin America, driving
down currencies and stock markets from Rio de Janiero to Caracas.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, a 20 percentage point hike in a benchmark
interest rates by Brazil's central bank, to 49.75 percent, calmed
currency markets. The rate was increased to stop investor flight
and ensure the currency remains within its required band of between
1.1715 reais to the US dollar to 1.1815 reais.
</P>
<P>
   The peso was unchanged Friday at 10.60 pesos, after weakening
from 10.32 pesos the previous day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this doesn't resolve the outflow of dollars,'' said Carlos
Seratto, a money market trader at Banco Patente in Sao Paulo,
``they going to have few alternatives besides devaluing.''
</P>
<P>
   Stock markets in the region stabilized. Brazil's market, the
Bovespa, which has lost nearly half its value this year _ most of
it since Aug. 1 _ regained its Thursday losses, jumping 13.4
percent Friday. Mexican stocks rose for the first time in three
days, up 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Markets cheered a statement by the IMF managing director, Michel
Camdessus, that the agency ``stands ready to strengthen its
financial support and broaden it to other countries, if necessary,
to back strong economic programs.''
</P>
<P>
   An IMF official, Stanley Fischer, first deputy managing
director, called the slide in Latin American financial markets in
the past two weeks is ``an overreaction to Russian events.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Brazil's economy grew 3 percent in 1997 and expected to
grow 1-1 1/2 percent this year; inflation is below 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But with a government's budget deficit of $50 billion _ about 7
percent of gross product _ debt and interest payments are coming
due by the end of October. A devaluation would further unravel the
country's delicate financial condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil is in better shape because of the strength of the
economy and the reforms that have taken place,'' Nancy Kimelman,
chief economist of Thomson Global Markets, a Boston research firm.
``They need to stabilize the currency and give foreign investors
some reason to have hope.''

   WASHINGTON _ In remarks intended to stress the sincerity of
President Clinton's recent apologies, Clinton's minister suggested
Friday that Hillary Rodham Clinton had herself put out misleading
information when her office issued a recent statement saying the
first lady had been ``misled'' and had learned of her husband's
relationship with Monica Lewinsky only a few days before his grand
jury appearance on Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. J. Philip Wogaman, pastor of Foundry United Methodist
Church in Washington, which the Clintons attend, first said in a
Thursday interview that the president had been seeking forgiveness
for the affair even before it became public last January. When
asked about those remarks on Friday, he repeated that Clinton ``had
been saying privately to people for some time about his sense of
remorse and wanting to deal with this. It's not as though these
apologies are coming out of the blue.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether those from whom Clinton had sought
forgiveness before January included his wife, whose office had
plainly suggested she had been surprised by news of the affair in
August, Wogaman said the president had not asked him to speak to
that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that's been said to me is pastorally privileged,
except that he specifically wanted me to underscore his statements
of repentance and contrition,'' Wogaman said, going on to complain
that he was ``a little appalled'' at the media's appetite for such
an unseemly story.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 17, Clinton testified about his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky, the former White House intern, and in a televised address
later told the nation: ``I know that my public comments and my
silence about the matter gave a false impression. I misled people.
Including even my wife.'' The following day, Mrs. Clinton's
spokeswoman, Marsha Berry, said that the first lady had asked her
to issue a statement on her behalf, saying that she was angry but
would stand by her husband.
</P>
<P>
   When asked, ``When did the president tell her he had an
inappropriate relationship with Monica Lewinsky?'' Ms. Berry said:
``She was misled. She learned the nature of his testimony over the
weekend.'' Others in the Clintons' immediate circle said
specifically she had learned of the relationship on the Thursday
before his Monday grand jury appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Critics immediately wondered whether Mrs. Clinton might not be
embracing the unlikely role of victim _ the trusting wife who was
the last to know _ in order to avoid the even less attractive view
that she lied on the `Today' show when she said she believed her
husband's denials and blamed his troubles on a ``vast right-wing
conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some of Mrs. Clinton's friends said privately that they
doubted any scenario in which she would have been caught off guard.
</P>
<P>
   But several who claimed direct knowledge from the Clintons
insisted that she had learned of the affair only in mid-August.
``The president said he told her this weekend. This much I know,''
a friend of the couple said in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   When asked on Friday when Mrs. Clinton learned of the
relationship, Ms. Berry said, ``I have no idea and that's something
I'm never going to ask her.'' And when asked to explain the
apparent discrepancy, she said, ``She learned the details of his
testimony over the weekend,'' before Aug. 17. The rest, she said,
``is between them.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nomination of Richard Holbrooke as U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations has been delayed indefinitely
while the Justice Department reviews his financial disclosure
statements and investigates his contacts with former State
Department colleagues after he left the department two years ago
for a job on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said the investigation began
when the State Department's inspector general received an anonymous
letter several weeks ago alleging that Holbrooke might have
violated federal ethics laws by lobbying U.S. diplomats overseas on
behalf of his investment banking firm, Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law bars former government officials from lobbying
former colleagues for one year after they leave office. The Justice
Department said in a statement that ``the department is reviewing
Ambassador Holbrooke's financial disclosure reports and his
contacts with State Department officials following his departure
from government.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House said that Holbrooke, the former U.S. ambassador
to Germany and the architect of the 1995 Dayton peace agreements
that brought an end to the war in Bosnia, has denied the
allegations and is cooperating with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Both President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
issued statements of support Friday for Holbrooke, who is now vice
chairman of Credit Suisse, and said they would push forward with
the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to a prompt resolution of this review and
submission of his nomination to the Senate,'' the president said.
``Ambassador Holbrooke has made remarkable contributions to our
nation's security in this administration and in previous
administrations.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke declined requests Friday for an interview. But an
adviser to Holbrooke, speaking on condition of anonymity, said,
``There's absolutely nothing to these allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   The adviser noted that while Holbrooke left the State Department
in February 1996 to join Credit Suisse _ he stepped down from the
post of assistant secretary of state for European and Canadian
Affairs _ he was asked by President Clinton to remain a special
government envoy to the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   In that unpaid post, Holbrooke repeatedly visited with State
Department officials in Washington and ambassadors and other senior
diplomats at U.S. embassies throughout 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``So Dick had legitimate business to carry on with the State
Department,'' the adviser said. ``There is a suggestion that he was
somehow conducting business for Credit Suisse in his contacts with
the State Department. But Dick was always very careful about
separating that.''
</P>
<P>
   The adviser said that Holbrooke had provided the State and
Justice departments with copies of his travel logs for 1996 that
showed which U.S. embassies he had visited that year.
Investigators, he said, have since contacted the embassies for
paperwork that might indicate the nature of Holbrooke's meetings in
the embassies.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear why Holbrooke's financial disclosure statements
were under scrutiny. In a 1996 disclosure statement to the Office
of Government Ethics, Holbrooke cataloged millions of dollars in
assets, including several homes and stock holdings in some of the
nation's largest corporations, including American Express, IBM and
H.J. Heinz Co.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional officials said that the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, which must review the nomination, had no evidence to
substantiate the allegations contained in the anonymous letter.
</P>
<P>
   But they said the delay by the White House in filing formal
nomination papers for Holbrooke meant that the United States would
be without an ambassador at the United Nations for the rest of the
year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee, had set a deadline of Friday to receive the papers if
the White House hoped to have Holbrooke confirmed this year. In a
statement last month, Helm's office said that he would not ``rush
the nomination through at the last minute.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Helms has a number of important issues to go over with
Holbrooke, including the status of the U.N.-State Department reform
legislation,'' the statement said. ``The administration is mistaken
if they expect the committee will rubber-stamp Holbrooke's
nomination.'' The previous ambassador to the United Nations, Bill
Richardson, is now energy secretary.
</P>
<P>
   In joining Credit Suisse a week after leaving the State
Department in February 1996, Holbrooke followed a well-trodden path
between Washington and Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Senior government officials, particularly those with experience
in foreign affairs and finance, have often landed good jobs on Wall
Street after stints in government.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Shafer, a former senior official in the Treasury
Department during the Clinton administration, is now a vice
chairman at Salomon Smith Barney, a subsidiary of Travelers Group.
Robert Hormats, who worked at both the State Department and the
Trade Representative's Office in the Carter and Reagan
administrations, is vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International, a
subsidiary of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   This was Holbrooke's second stint on Wall Street. He had worked
for several years as an investment banker at Lehman Brothers after
leaving his job as assistant secretary of state for East Asian and
Pacific Affairs throughout the Carter administration.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse declined to provide a list of the firm's clients
who have worked with Holbrooke since 1996. But a spokesman for the
firm, Edmund Pendleton, said that among the firm's U.S. clients,
Holbrooke had done business with ``some media companies, biotech
and financial companies.''

CLINTON LOOKS TO HIS RELIGIOUS ROOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a child growing up in Hot Springs, Ark., Bill Clinton would
dress himself in his Sunday finest and head off, alone, to praise
God at Park Place Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   He used to read Bible passages over the loudspeaker in school.
At Georgetown University, Clinton's writings so impressed a
philosophy professor that the teacher once asked the president to
consider becoming a Jesuit.
</P>
<P>
   The professor, Otto Hentz, was shocked when Clinton told him he
wasn't a Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has always been deeply influenced and comforted by his
Christian roots, and it is within that strongly Southern Baptist
heritage that he is _ again _ seeking redemption and spiritual
renewal.
</P>
<P>
   Several Southern Baptist minsters interviewed Friday said that
his extraordinary, contrite speech Friday at the National Prayer
Breakfast meeting was exactly appropriate within the world of
Christianity that has shaped the president. For the first time,
Clinton publicly asked forgiveness from his family and from Monica
Lewinsky, the White House intern with whom he had a sexual affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my experience in pastoral counseling, when people deal with
wrongdoing in their lives, in many instances their first statement
is rather defensive and shows a sense of denial,'' said the
Reverend C. Welton Gaddy, a Southern Baptist minister and executive
director of The Interfaith Alliance, a moderate Christian
organization in Washington. ``But after days go by, and they
interact with what they've done they become more contrite, more
emotional and exhibit more of an air of sincerity. It takes a
tremendous amount of humility and honesty to say, `I have
sinned.'''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's speech reflected a keen understanding of what sin
means to Christians, pastors said. Beyond mere forgiveness, Clinton
acknowledged repentance and a desire to change his ways _ with the
help of God.
</P>
<P>
   In some more conservative Southern Baptist congregations,
Clinton's admission of marital infidelity would likely bring some
form of censure, including being placed on probation.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Clinton's home church, Immanuel Baptist Church in
Little Rock, Ark., has come under fire from some fellow Southern
Baptists for failing to ``disfellow'' or expel the president for
his extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should stop his efforts to save his administration, and
make clear his efforts to restore his relationship to Jesus Christ
and to model and live what is indicated in Scripture as the
authentic life of the Christian disciple,'' R. Albert Mohler Jr.,
president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville,
KY., told reporters Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the Southern Baptist Convention, Paige
Patterson, has publicly called on Clinton to resign not only
because the president may have broken federal laws, but because of
his concerns about his moral character.
</P>
<P>
   But another important tenet in Southern Baptist doctrine _
indeed, in all of Christianity _ is the notion of grace, and the
importance of forgiveness. Ministers from various denominations
said the President would have every right to expect this from
church.
</P>
<P>
   At Georgetown, a Jesuit institution, Clinton was profoundly
influenced by the social teachings of the Roman Catholic Church,
coming away with a sense that true Christian belief requires
standing up for those who have the least. He has attended summer
Pentecostal revival meetings, celebrating with fundamentalists who
speak in tongues.
</P>
<P>
   And he regularly corresponds with a handful of clergy, including
the Reverend Gordon MacDonald, senior minister at Grace Chapel in
Lexington, Mass. MacDonald reportedly spent time with Clinton after
the National Prayer Breakfast meeting Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton became a member of Immanuel Baptist Church, a flagship
Southern Baptist congregation whose Sunday services are broadcast
on television throughout Arkansas, in 1980. Clinton struck up a
deep friendship with the church's former pastor, the Rev. Worley
Oscar Vaught, who died of cancer in 1989. Vaught became the father
Clinton never had. ``I think he instinctively knew that I needed
him, and maybe in ways that I wasn't aware of,'' Clinton told the
Washington Post in 1992. ``He was guiding without being
judgmental.''
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming president, Clinton has attended Foundry United
Methodist Church in Washington with his wife, Hillary, who is a
Methodist.

 &HT;    NEWS ANALYSIS: CLINTON VS. NIXON: NOW AND THEN
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON Millions of Americans may be asking whether the lurid
account of a sexual liaison between Bill Clinton and Monica
Lewinsky, as graphically set forth in the Starr report, clears the
constitutional bar of removing a president from office.
</P>
<P>
   But the 35 members of the House Judiciary Committee, in whose
hands the president's fate initially rests, must put any admitted
sex acts aside for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they must ponder whether a report they read for the
first time on Friday along with countless ordinary citizens
contains substantial and credible evidence of impeachable acts as
the law under which independent counsel Kenneth Starr filed his
``referral'' demands.
</P>
<P>
   As David Kendall, the president's personal lawyer sees it, the
lawmakers' initial review should convince them to reject Starr's
complaint. ``This private mistake does not amount to an impeachable
action,'' Kendall wrote in a 78-page rebuttal that reached
reporters hours before they got Starr's massive document.
</P>
<P>
   Should the committee cast Kendall's arguments aside and decide
to proceed, the big story that now grips the nation could add many
more chapters before coming to a close. As that story unfolds, it's
always possible, of course, that Clinton will resign as Richard
Nixon did 24 years ago after his support among congressional
Republicans all but collapsed amid the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   If the judiciary panel launches a full-scale inquiry, after
obtaining requisite backing from a majority of House members, it
would no longer be limited to the evidence contained in the Starr
report. That was the case in Nixon's impeachment ordeal, when the
committee broadened the scope of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   While scholars disagree whether gross sexual misconduct in the
West Wing should lead to impeachment, most concur that indictable
offenses are also impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   As Jason Vicente of the CATO Institute, a Washington think tank,
put it: ``There's a fundamental inconsistency ... between a
president's oath to faithfully execute the law and his having
himself committed offenses indictable under (those laws).''
</P>
<P>
   This is the crux of the argument for action that was put forward
by Starr, who has been investigating the Clinton White House for
more than four years. As his report puts it:
</P>
<P>
   ``In view of the enormous trust and responsibility attendant to
his high office, the president has a manifest duty to ensure that
his conduct at all times complies with the law of the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``In sum, perjury and acts that obstruct justice by any citizen
whether in a criminal case, a grand jury investigation, a
congressional hearing, a civil trial, or civil discovery are
profoundly serious matters. When such acts are committed by the
president of the United States, we believe those acts may
constitute grounds for an impeachment.'''
</P>
<P>
   Again, as was the crux of the case with Nixon, Starr alleges
that Clinton's efforts to ``cover up'' his actions constitute the
truly serious offenses worthy of impeachment and, ultimately, a
trial before the full Senate. Recognizing that threat, Kendall
countered in an extraordinary White House briefing that Starr has
``extravagantly exaggerated'' what actually took place.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 mid-term elections remain a wild card in the
impeachment deck. If the voters' mood swings toward the president,
in a wide backlash against Republican efforts to drive him from
office, the committee could then be returned to Democratic control,
thereby radically altering the political calculus.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon was widely popular when the Congress began its Watergate
probe but left office with only 25 percent support. Clinton's
approval ratings have recently remained in the low 60s, a critical
factor that his fellow Democrats will monitor closely. If the Starr
report or subsequent revelations turn the public mood against
Clinton, Democrats on Capitol Hill are likely to follow, which
could bring down the curtain prematurely on his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   And it still remains to be seen how Clinton would react if the
impeachment proceedings are triggered and, perhaps, expanded to
cover his role in the 1996 campaign finance scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Says Bill Curry, a former Clinton aide, said ``(The president)
must feel a profound lack of control.... This kind of adversity is
always unimagined in advance. To have won reelection to the
presidency and then face the possibility of extinction is something
he was not prepared for.''
</P>
<P>
   However the current drama plays itself out, presidential
effectiveness is also likely to come under sharp scrutiny in the
weeks to come. The White House mantra _ that it is ``time to move
on'' _ would have little resonance if, say, Monica Lewinsky were to
be called to testify on television.
</P>
<P>
   Such potential distractions do matter, according the Leonard
Garment, who served as an Nixon aide and confidante. Garment
recalled Nixon telling him after he left office that ``his thinking
had been clouded by worry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew,'' Garment said, ``that for the last year his judgment
was off. All his waking energy and all his dream time was
distracted by questions of survival and it affected his judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a quarter century later, the Starr report, whatever its
merits as a road map to impeachment, has already made its mark as a
cause of deep concern for another embattled president.

HAMAS VOWS VENGEANCE IN SHOOTINGS OF BROTHERS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Islamic movement Hamas vowed Friday to carry out
a wave of terrorist attacks to avenge what it called
``assassinations'' by Israeli forces of two leading Hamas
militants.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli troops stormed a building on the outskirts of Hebron
Thursday afternoon, shooting two Palestinian brothers, Imad and
Adel Awadallah, apparently before they reached for weapons, Israeli
army officials told reporters Friday.
</P>
<P>
   As word of the killings spread through the West Bank
Fridayclashes between Palestinian youths and Israeli forces
erupted. Israel went into a state of heightened security.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli troops also moved to seal borders with Palestinian areas
to guard against attacks by Hamas, which has claimed responsibility
for a wave of suicide bombings that have killed scores of Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Hamas's spiritual leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, pledged that his
movement's armed brigades would retaliate against Israel, saying,
``The assasination of Imad and Adel Awadallah will not finish the
march. It will make it stronger and more violent, and the future
will witness more bloodshed.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior Palestinian Authority official Ahmed Abdel-Rahman called
the killings ``state-sponsored terrorism,'' which he said he
believed was timed by Israel to undermine renewed efforts by US
envoy Dennis Ross to break the 18-month deadlock in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   David Bar-Ilan, a senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, said, ``The Awadallah brothers are terrorist
leaders responsible for killing many Israelis. The fact that they
were killed shows that Israel will catch terrorists regardless.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials said that several days before the raid
security forces were drawn to the Hebron building where the two
brothers were found by the sound of shots and an explosion. The
building was located in an area that remains under Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
   The officials displayed for reporters a cache of weapons seized
in the raid, including two machine guns, nine grenades, and several
handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Wigs, which apparently were to be used as disguises by the
alleged terrorists, and a handcrafted banner for Hamas ``Izz
el-Deen al-Qassam,'' or military brigade, were also presented as
evidence to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The killing of the brothers seems to have also deepened a murder
mystery that has puzzled Israelis and Palestinians since March 29
when the body of Hamas master bomb-maker, Muhyideen Sharif, was
found outside an exploded car garage.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy revealed that Sharifhad been killed by four gunshot
wounds to the chest, not the explosion in the garage, as Israeli
officials orginally claimed.
</P>
<P>
   One of the brothers, Imad Awadallah, was killed just days after
Palestinian security chief Jibril Rajoub had called him the key to
solving the riddle of who killed Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset, Hamas officials were quick to blame Israel for
the Sharif killing.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli news reports have suggested that perhaps the Palestinian
Authority security forces had killed the militant leader of Hamas,
which violently opposes Palestinian Authority president Yasser
Arafat's signing of a peace agreement with Israel. Other reports
have suggested that it was the result of an internal struggle
within Hamas.
</P>
<P>
   Now new questions and conspiracy theories are sure to emerge as
Israel admits its role in killing the man who may have held the key
to solving the murder of Sharif.

   ``It's not going to get any prettier as the day goes on,'' Tom
Brokaw said around 2:45 Friday afternoon, a little more than an
hour into NBC's marathon on-air reporting of details from
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   NBC was the first of the broadcast networks on the air (by about
10 minutes) and stayed on the longest, but all three networks as
well as the 24-hour cable channels jumped on the report, even as
they struggled to communicate its details to the public without
uttering words that might offend their audiences. Correspondents
read from photocopies and computer screens, censoring the explicit
details as they went along, embracing euphemisms as they tangled
with the English language and public acceptability.
</P>
<P>
   For days, there had been a drumbeat of warnings about the
seaminess of sexual detail to come. But Friday's coverage was
marked by a new sense of seriousness and balance. The tone was
almost funereal, and there were constant reminders that Starr's
report is one-sided. And there were many disclaimers that the
sexual details are crucial to Starr's charges of perjury against
the president.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's an enormous amount of graphic language'' in the Starr
report, Peter Jennings warned on ABC. The details could be found on
the Internet, where the entire report would be posted, he said, but
viewers would not hear that language on his network. Similar
warnings that this material was not family-friendly came from Dan
Rather on CBS, from Brokaw (carried on both MSNBC and its 24-hour
channel MSNBC) and from the 24-hour cable channels CNN and Fox News
Channel.
</P>
<P>
   On CBS, Bob Schieffer looked profoundly embarrassed as he read
cold from the report, citing Monica Lewinsky's testimony that the
president ``unzipped his pants and sort of exposed himself.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC and CNN reported that the ``semen stain'' on Ms. Lewinsky's
famous dress matched the president's DNA. But generally, the
correspondents' language was more discreet than that of the Starr
report. CBS's Scott Pelley referred to ``a love note of a sexually
explicit nature'' from Monica Lewinsky to the president, and Lisa
Myers of NBC said the note referred to the film ``Titanic'' and
suggested ``a particular kind of sex.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN sometimes went farther than the others. Candy Crowley sat at
a computer screen, with the report visible to television viewers.
Once, after issuing what she called ``our usual cautionary tale,''
she read one of the most explicit passages out loud.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days a seesaw battle for television coverage between
the Starr and Clinton camps has developed. In the morning all the
networks carried the president's appearance at a prayer breakfast,
when he said, ``I don't think there is a fancy way to say that I
have sinned.'' That instantly became the soundbite of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   The networks broke in several times during the day. NBC and CBS
covered the House of Representatives' vote to release the Starr
report; all three networks covered the rebuttals by Clinton's
lawyers. But by late afternoon everything else was overwhelmed by
the sheer mass of the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   By evening, Sen. Orin Hatch, R-Utah, one of Clinton's fiercest
critics, appeared on a split screen with an appearance by Hillary
Clinton. Vice-President Al Gore had introduced her, while the
president waited to receive an award from an Irish-American group.
The media battle seemed set to continue through the weekend, not
getting any prettier at all.

INTERNET COMES THROUGH AMID DEMAND FOR STARR REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton is in serious trouble thanks to the Starr
report, but the Internet came through just fine.
</P>
<P>
   Early reports suggest the publication of the Starr report may be
the biggest public event in the Internet's history. Millions of
people flocked to Internet news sites and on-line services to read
about the report and download copies.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Internet experts warned of a possible high-tech
meltdown, with too many people trying to download the 445-page
report at the same time. But for the most part, the system worked.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the actual amount of data was trivial by Internet
standards. The text version of the report was only about 700,000
bytes in length. Even with millions of downloads, such a document
added almost nothing to overall Internet traffic. ``This is barely
a blip,'' said Alan Taffel, vice president of marketing for UUNET
Technologies Inc., a major Internet service provider in Fairfax,
Va.
</P>
<P>
   However, Internet users in some parts of the country suffered
more than a blip. UUNET, which carries a large percentage of the
nation's Internet traffic, lost hundreds of high-speed data
connections when a freight train derailed in Georgia and ruptured a
fiberoptic line near the track.
</P>
<P>
   According to Rich Lappenbusch, director of operations for MSNBC
on the Internet, the outage had a serious effect on Internet
service in Boston. Lappenbusch said his site easily handled demand
for the Starr report in most parts of the country, but Boston
visitors to the MSNBC site faced delays of up to 40 seconds.
Lappenbusch said this was because a lot of Internet traffic was
diverted to the Boston area to get around the UUNET outage.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, MSNBC reported its biggest day ever. Final figures
are not available, but the site expects double its previous daily
record of 1.13 million visitors.
</P>
<P>
   CNN also expects to break records at its site. Even before the
report was posted, CNN was getting 340,000 ``hits,'' or data
requests, per minute, higher than ever before. After the report
appeared, the hit rate soared so fast that technicians could not
keep count.
</P>
<P>
   America Online's 13 million subscribers had easy access to the
report. By 6:30 p.m, more than 150,000 of them had downloaded
copies.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Many &UR;  &LR; sites that carried the report had installed additional
server computers to distribute Web pages and added more high-speed
digital lines to transmit the data.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the government Web sites that were to originally host
the report were often unreachable. The Library of Congress did not
even get the report on-line until 3:45 p.m., over an hour after CNN
had made it available. In addition, many people set up personal Web
pages with copies of the report. Such pages are available free of
charge through services like Angelfire, Tripod and GeoCities.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, users who found one site blocked by heavy traffic
could easily get the report someplace else. So Internet congestion
eased quickly after a couple of hours.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The phrase runs like a grim mantra through Kenneth
Starr's report to Congress: ``There is substantial and credible
information that President Clinton ...''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Whitewater independent counsel's 445-page
``referral,'' specifying 11 possible grounds for impeaching the
president, is brimming with information: dates, times, quotations
from previously secret grand jury testimony, graphic descriptions
of sexual encounters between Clinton and Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   It is the way the report marshals and characterizes the
information it presents that converts it into an aggressive piece
of legal advocacy. Few of the factual assertions are left to speak
for themselves. ``The president's linguistic parsing is
unreasonable,'' the report says of Clinton's struggle to avoid
acknowledging the sexual nature of the relationship. At many other
points, the report characterizes the president's testimony as
deceptive, ``not plausible,'' or defying ``common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, this is a document with attitude. It serves up a
worst-case scenario: conversations that some might find
inconclusive, ambiguous, or at worst suggestive, such as the
exchanges between the president and Betty Currie, his secretary, in
the period surrounding Clinton's deposition in the Paula Jones
sexual misconduct civil lawsuit, are characterized as a criminal
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's public denial on Jan. 26 of sexual relations with
``that woman, Miss Lewinsky'' was not simply a politically
disastrous whopper of historic proportions. It was part of an
impeachable offense, a presidential failure of the constitutional
duty to faithfully execute the laws, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors considering seeking criminal indictments typically
prepare in-house memorandums outlining a potential case, much as
Starr has done here. But those memorandums include a section that
the Starr report conspicuously omits _ a frank discussion of
possible defenses to the charges and of vulnerabilities in the
prosecution's case.
</P>
<P>
   The analogy is not exact, of course; This is not a criminal
case, in which a prosecutor must prove conduct that meets the
precise statutory definition of a criminal offense. Impeachment is
an open-ended concept, an impeachable offense essentially
determined by what a majority of the House decides it to be.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, this report is notable for its failure to
acknowledge that there might be more than one way to view at least
some of the evidence. For example, Starr concludes that the
president ``orchestrated'' the concealment of gifts he had given
Ms. Lewinsky, a question on which the evidence is certainly
suggestive but not conclusive. In trying to make the case that this
episode amounted to an obstruction of justice, the report simply
dismisses contrary interpretations with the statement that ``those
inferences fall outside the range of reasonable possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The Starr report is in sharp contrast to the information Leon
Jaworski, the Watergate special prosecutor, gave the House
Judiciary Committee that was considering the impeachment of
President Nixon in 1974. Jaworski handed the committee a briefcase
stuffed with 800 pages of documents, 13 White House tape
recordings, and a ``road map,'' essentially an index to the
material. He provided no analysis and drew no conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   As anticipated, the Starr report is rife with details of sexual
encounters, toward which the independent counsel adopts a tone of
pained necessity. ``The president's testimony unfortunately has
rendered the details essential,'' the report asserts, arguing that
Clinton's sworn denials of a ``sexual relationship,'' ``sexual
affair,'' and ``sexual relations'' amounted to perjury.
</P>
<P>
   The implication that Starr was somehow compelled to offer up
such unpleasant material begs the question whether this was a road
that any independent counsel needed to travel in the first place.
It begs the further question of whether the conduct depicted
amounts to high crimes and misdemeanors, or low comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Where Starr finds criminality, others might find pathos or even
farce, if only the context for these disclosures was not so heavily
freighted. In a scene reminiscent of a Feydeau bedroom comedy, Ms.
Lewinsky is depicted as ``walking away briskly'' from an encounter
with the president as Harold Ickes unexpectedly enters the Oval
Office through another entrance.
</P>
<P>
   The sexual details were widely anticipated in advance to be
shocking, and some of them undoubtedly are, but the prevailing
image is one of banality rather than pornography. According to Ms.
Lewinsky's grand jury testimony, as quoted in the report, Clinton
told her that she made him feel young, and she in turn fantasized
about marriage. She also offered him ``my stupid ideas about what I
thought should be done in the administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Even lawyers not particularly friendly toward Clinton may
dispute Starr's assertion that the president's invocation of
various legal privileges to shield aides from having to testify was
itself an impeachable offense. While the White House lost initial
rounds of some of these battles, appeals on attorney-client
privilege and a Secret Service ``protective function'' privilege
remain pending at the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   In the one privilege case growing out of the Starr investigation
that the court has actually decided _ and which the report does not
mention _ the justices ruled against Starr unanimously. The court
rebuffed his effort to obtain notes taken by the lawyer for Vincent
Foster, the deputy White House counsel who committed suicide,
ruling that the age-old the attorney-client privilege survives the
death of the client.

 &HT;    LAWYERS DENY STARR CHARGES ARE IMPEACHABLE OFFENSES
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ White House lawyers Friday countered Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr's report to Congress with a 78-page rebuttal
arguing that President Clinton has broken no laws and that his
admitted sexual misconduct does not rise to an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after Clinton tearfully acknowledged wrongdoing but
vowed to ``mount a vigorous defense,'' the lawyers assailed the
motives driving Starr's investigation and the 450-page report that
appeared in lurid detail on Capitol Hill and on Internet sites in
the early afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The salacious allegations in this report are simply intended
to humiliate, embarrass and politically damage the president,''
David E. Kendall, the president's private attorney, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president did not commit perjury, he did not obstruct
justice, he did not tamper with witnesses, and he did not abuse the
power of his office,'' Kendall said, ticking off the charges
outlined in the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   While the lawyers repeatedly acknowledged that Clinton had erred
in having a sexual relationship with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky, the lawyers said that the wrongs were ``private''
ones that do not meet the the ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' test
that the Constitution sets for impeaching a president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's legal team also would not say the president was
prepared to accept a lesser rebuke, such as a congressional
censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's any pain inflicted, it's happened,'' said Charles
Ruff, the White House counsel, when asked if the president would
accept a punishment from Congress short of impeachment. ``We're not
talking about formally reaching out and imposing more pain on the
president than he's already imposed on himself.''
</P>
<P>
   In launching their effort to stave off impeachment, his
attorneys took their lead from Clinton, who at a morning prayer
breakfast said, ``I will instruct my lawyers to mount a vigorous
defense, using all available appropriate arguments.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the White House legal team had complained that they had
no advance look at the report, they nonetheless were prepared with
their response, based on news leaks and their own
information-sharing with many of the more than 70 witnesses who
testified before Starr's grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   In the response to the allegations, the lawyers repeatedly
conceded much of the questionable behavior. They acknowledged
Clinton's efforts to obscure facts and mislead when he denied that
he had had sexual relations with Lewinsky in a sworn deposition in
the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit last Jan. 17.
</P>
<P>
   But that answer did not amount to perjury, they said, because of
the highly technical way Clinton was interpreting the term ``sexual
relations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If answers are truthful or literally truthful but misleading,
there is no perjury as a matter of law, no matter how misleading
the testimony is or is intended to be,'' the legal memorandum said.
``The law simply does not require the witness to aid his
interrogator.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if that standard of truthfulness is too low for a
president, Kendall said that Clinton's response was justified
because the Jones case against him was ``a highly charged lawsuit
for political means.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the White House disputed contentions that Clinton had
tried to influence Lewinsky's testimony in the Jones case. ``I
don't think there was any concealment story concocted here
whatsoever,'' Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers also dismissed allegations that Clinton had
attempted to tamper with a witness when he summoned his secretary,
Betty Currie, to work on the Sunday, Jan. 18, the morning after his
Paula Jones case deposition, and quizzed her about whether he had
been alone with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall told reporters that Clinton was not trying to steer a
witness because Currie had not been called as a witness for any
case at the time. Currie was later called before the Starr grand
jury.
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps the most forcefully expressed arguments, the White
House lawyers rejected the Starr report's suggestion that the
president had abused his powers by using his government lawyers and
staff to cover up his relationship with Lewinsky by filing legal
appeals to keep aides from testifying.
</P>
<P>
   The White House rebuttal called that a legal use of presidential
powers. And as for permitting his staff to perpetuate lies, the
lawyers argued, in essence, that that is standard procedure:
</P>
<P>
   ``If allowing aides to repeat misleading statement is a crime,
then any number of public officials are guilty of misusing their
office for as long as they fail to admit wrong doing in response to
any allegation about their activities.''

 &HT;    CLINTON, SAYING 'I HAVE SINNED,' BROADENS HIS PUBLIC APOLOGIES
 &HT;    680&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fighting for his office and bowing before God,
President Clinton bared his soul to the nation Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton declared ''I have sinned'' to religious leaders at a
breakfast just hours before the release of an exhaustive report
detailing his sexual relationship with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky and laying out the case for his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton vowed to ''continue on the path of repentance'' while
waging ''a vigorous defense'' to save his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will intensify my efforts to lead our country and the world
toward peace and freedom, prosperity and harmony,'' Clinton told
the religious leaders at the nationally televised White House
breakfast, ''in the hope that, with a broken spirit and a still
strong heart, I can be used for greater good.''
</P>
<P>
   To the battery of personal and White House attorneys that
continued Friday to defend him in the Lewinsky scandal, the
president is now looking to add a third legal team to contend
specifically with the threat of impeachment, said spokesman Michael
McCurry.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, however, Clinton focused on the theme of
personal apology, admitting that he ''was not contrite enough'' in
his widely criticized Aug. 17 confession of an intimate
relationship with Lewinsky and misleading remarks about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think there is a fancy way to say that I have
sinned,'' Clinton said, his eyes moist.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sorrow I feel is genuine,'' he said, adding that he was
seeking forgiveness from ''my family, also my friends, my staff, my
cabinet, Monica Lewinsky and her family and the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   And, as part of his most abject public apology to date, Clinton
invited parents to turn his troubles into an object lesson for the
nation's youth.
</P>
<P>
   ''The children of this country can learn in a profound way that
integrity is important and selfishness is wrong,'' Clinton said.
''But God can change us and make us strong at the broken places.''
</P>
<P>
   In a day of contrasts that mixed supplication with solemnity,
Clinton rose early after working into the wee hours of the morning,
his Bible at his side, drafting his breakfast address on three
pages of White House notepaper.
</P>
<P>
   While his lawyers scrambled to produce a 73-page rebuttal of
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's report to Congress on the
Lewinsky scandal, Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
left the breakfast for the National Cathedral. There, Clinton
participated in a memorial service to honor the Americans killed
last month in terrorist bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their work was about bringing better lives to all,'' Clinton
said, quickly shifting from his role as repentant sinner to that of
grief-stricken leader, shepherding the nation through the pain
inflicted upon it by the darker forces of a dangerous world.
</P>
<P>
   ''They worked to create opportunity and hope, to fight poverty
and disease, to bridge divides between peoples and nations, to
promote tolerance and peace,'' Clinton said. ''We thank God for
their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the White House for a briefing on the world's
flashpoints from national security adviser Samuel Berger, then
readied himself to receive a peace and justice award from the
Emerald Isle Immigration Center, which provides assistance to Irish
immigrants, in recognition of Clinton's contribution to a
U.S.-brokered peace agreement for Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton drew enthusiastic applause from several hundred
hand-picked supporters invited to attend the South Lawn ceremonies
on a clear and sunny afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hillary and I have been over there just lapping this up,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging the warm reception and underscoring through her
presence her support of Clinton on one of the bleakest days of his
presidency, the first lady beamed at the crowd. At one point during
sustained applause, she broke into joyous laughter and said to the
crowd, ''You make us feel like we're back in Ireland,'' a reference
to the president's trip there last week.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Hovering over every word Clinton uttered and every move he made
Friday lurked a moment the administration has dreaded for months:
the release of the long-awaited report of Starr's investigation
into the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The report, read by members of Congress expected to begin
impeachment proceedings based on its contents and, over the
Internet, by millions of other Americans, was a graphic, extensive
and in places shocking look at an intimate relationship between the
president and a former White House intern half his age.
</P>
<P>
   In the third day of a campaign of public contrition, however,
Clinton avoided critiquing his critics, leaving that instead to his
personal attorney, David Kendall, who urged Americans to regard the
Starr report as a political statement meant to humiliate the
president, not a legal document justifying impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a news story _ a man trying to keep an
inappropriate relationship private,'' Kendall told reporters at a
White House briefing. ''This is personal, and not impeachable.''

ANOTHER STORM DRENCHES HOUSTON, FLOODING BUT SPARING LIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, La.)   (bl)  
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Less than three weeks after Tropical Storm Charley
barged through South Texas, leaving 19 people dead from flooding,
Tropical Storm Frances swirled up the Texas Gulf Coast early Friday
and dumped nearly a foot of rain here in the nation's
fourth-largest city, turning it into a water theme park.
</P>
<P>
   Interstate highways became rivers. Neighborhoods turned into
islands. Underpasses and low-lying intersections became ponds,
often with half-submerged, abandoned cars, like alligators peeking
from the water.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, remarkably, there was no loss of life and there were no
reports of serious injuries in Houston or in any of the dozens of
other communities along the Texas coast hit hard by the slow-moving
storm.
</P>
<P>
   A 22-year-old man was killed late Thursday in Lafourche Parish,
La., when a tornado created by the storm front blew apart his
trailer home and sucked him into the air, dropping him on top of a
neighbor's shed, said a spokesman for the parish sheriff's office.
</P>
<P>
   Houston officials attributed the lack of injuries to warnings of
the storm's approach, though it did turn out to be more torrential
and sluggish than had been expected, causing it to linger over the
metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   The timing was good, too. The storm was at its height in the
early hours, when most workers and parents were trying to decide
whether to try to get to work or school, and many decided to stay
home. It was a wise decision, city officials said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``People were listening this time,'' said Frank Gutierrez,
operations commander with the Harris County Office of Emergency
Management. ``They're starting to pay attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Flash flooding is not uncommon during heavy rainstorms in
Houston, and similar flooding hit some neighborhoods on the north
side of town in 1992 and gushed through parts of Interstate 10 in
1994. But city officials and many residents said Friday that they
could not recall a time when the flooding had been so widespread
and so rapid.
</P>
<P>
   Some 3,000 miles of bayous crisscross the sprawling Houston
metropolitan area, and emergency officials said that virtually all
of them had overflowed by early morning after 10 to 12 inches of
rain spilled on the city overnight, sometimes dropping as much as
an inch an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Interstate 10, which runs west from downtown in a gully, was
under up to eight feet of surging water. At one point, a city bus
bobbed in the current.
</P>
<P>
   All over the city, but especially in some northern
neighborhoods, the bayous surged from their banks and ran through
nearby apartment buildings and subdivisions, gurgling up front
steps and sweeping through kitchens. Schools were closed. Traffic
was nearly at a standstill. Many businesses were shut. Hundreds of
cars were abandoned by drivers who had tried to get to work in the
morning and had given up as the waters crawled up their door
panels.
</P>
<P>
   All through the late morning and early afternoon, police
officers, firefighters and rescue workers floated down city streets
in canoes, on jet skis and in rubber dinghies, knocking on
second-floor windows to find stranded residents and ferry them to
drier ground. All day long, the local television news was full of
images of people in overloaded bass boats trying to get family pets
and a few possessions to safety.
</P>
<P>
   Other neighborhoods, on higher ground, were relatively
unscathed, except for branches and leaves blown down by the heavy
overnight winds. But even a lot of those neighborhoods were
marooned by rising waters in surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
   Utility officials said that more than 20,000 people were without
electricity Friday morning, and new power failures were being
reported as fast as the old ones could be repaired.
</P>
<P>
   The coast, which had been hard-hit by the storm Thursday,
continued to have some flooding throughout Friday in a 350-mile
swath from Corpus Christi to Morgan City, La.
</P>
<P>
   A newly finished boardwalk in Kemah, southeast of Houston, was
demolished by the rising waters, which surged into many of the
shops and restaurants lining it. Many residents near the coast were
working hard Friday to salvage what they could from flooded houses.
</P>
<P>
   By noon, though, even though a flood watch continued throughout
much of the coastal region and into the Central Texas Hill Country,
the waters were receding. A bright blue sky and blazing sun
sparkled off the diminishing waters by midafternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The storm had been downgraded to a tropical depression by late
afternoon, with its center stalled over the small town of Goliad,
about 100 miles southeast of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The first night of an annual weekend festival called the Power
of Houston, with music, food, laser displays and fireworks, was
canceled, as were evening performances of many downtown events.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said they would be assessing the damage over the
weekend, and if the cost was high enough, they would try to secure
federal disaster aid. A few other communities along the coast and
in Louisiana were already asking for federal aid Friday.
</P>
<P>
   There was some concern that although the fiercest part of the
storm had passed away from Houston, the tail end could still bring
1 to 3 inches of fresh rain later Friday. If it fell fast enough,
the rain could cause the bayous to swell their banks again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're catching our breath for the second wave,'' said Corina
Love, a spokeswoman for the city's emergency operations center.
``Or is it the third wave? I've lost count of the waves.''

<P>
   MOTOZINTLA, Mexico _ Last Sunday afternoon, after four days of
rains so relentless that even nonbelievers might imagine a biblical
flood, the Las Canoas River abruptly rose from its bed and made for
a new one.
</P>
<P>
   Once the river was a trickle; on Thursday, in the eighth day of
rains, its brown waters plunged right through Ambrosio Ramirez's
living room, through the Pentecostal church and the corner candy
store, and over mud-encased cars where a mechanic's shop used to
be. The waters eventually joined two other equally wayward rivers
at the bottom of this small city.
</P>
<P>
   In Motozintla, a low-budget trading post in Chiapas state, near
Guatemala, everyone is pacing about the street because they can't
stay inside their dank homes. Nearly every house was visited by the
flood. Two neighborhoods were swept away completely by a river that
until recently had been so thin that many residents forgot it was
there.
</P>
<P>
   Odilio Perez Gonzalez, a 35-year-old bricklayer, stood on a
mound of hard mud. ``My house was here, but it left,'' he said,
speaking, as many people here did, of their lost precious things as
though they had had a life of their own. Vast areas of the coastal
plains and dozens of towns are under water as a result of the
rains, which gathered speed in mountain gullies and ripped out
electric lines, water pipes, at least 30 bridges and many chunks of
highway.
</P>
<P>
   With hundreds of thousands of people cut off from overland aid
deliveries, the flooding caused a surprisingly severe disaster in a
state already unsettled by a four-year-long face-off between the
government and the Zapatista guerrillas, and by years of chronic
depression that sets the area apart from prospering northern
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Chiapas state government, 41 people were killed
and at least 70 are missing. But many villages have reported
mudslides covering houses that have yet to be excavated. And people
in Motozintla report seeing what looked like a girl's body floating
by in the river.
</P>
<P>
   Even the people in the middle of the calamity have had a hard
time grasping its dimensions. There was no hurricane or other nasty
act of nature that could be given a name. Motozintla has no wealthy
class and no cachet, in contrast, say, to the resort of Acapulco,
which drew international concern and assistance after it was struck
by a hurricane last year.
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo came to the region on Wednesday night
and ordered a full-scale relief effort led by the armed forces,
including a helicopter airlift. But he asked people for ``great
patience,'' because the foul weather and broken roads meant that
although emergency food and water are available, they can't be
delivered.
</P>
<P>
   But after three days without food, many residents are edging
toward panic as hunger closes in on them and their children.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The floods were particularly malicious with people here. They
left Ramirez's geraniums but took his living-room furniture and the
front wall of his house. The waters reached into a tortilla bakery
and stole 2 tons of fresh corn dough.
</P>
<P>
   They left Julio Cesar Castillo's car-repair shop standing but
snatched all the tools he had spent a lifetime collecting. Worst of
all, they carried away hundreds of acres of cropland at the valley
bottom where most of the residents farmed corn and peanuts; now the
farmers have a scar of rocky open earth.
</P>
<P>
   Elena Verdugo Bravo, 50, who was widowed last week and left with
six children, said the river carried off the front two rooms of her
house and tore out all but a small piece of its plot of land; the
rooms that remain are at the brink of a 20-foot cliff, looking out
at lost cornfields. Before the rains, the river was a quarter-mile
from her home, she said.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as June these territories were scorched by a drought
that withered the newly planted corn stalks and caused uncontrolled
forest fires that covered the state in thick smoke.
</P>
<P>
   These are the lands where Maya Indians built a great
civilization in the first millennium after Christ. In some
primordial way, people here _ many of whom are Mam Cachiquel
Indians _ recall that their ancestors rose to heights of cultural
achievement and power and then tumbled from grace.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists have never reached a definitive conclusion about
the cause of collapse of the Maya world in the ninth century A.D.
But most theories hold that the Maya fell in some way out of
balance with nature.
</P>
<P>
   So Motozintla residents are also asking themselves what kind of
balance they might have upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people here don't believe in God,'' Abimael Rodriguez,
36, a merchant, affirmed with great certainty. He spoke to a crowd
jammed in the back of a pickup truck that ferried people from
Motozintla to a shattered bridge where they had to start walking to
reach the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   Other residents recalled that last year 300 townspeople lynched
three men they accused of robbery and rape. The men were beaten
unconscious and burned alive. But the riders in the truck quickly
dismissed the possibility that this act might have put them wrong
with the gods.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were criminals and the police were protecting them,''
several men agreed solemnly.
</P>
<P>
   Deep political suspicions came to light. The mayor of Motozintla
is from the government's party, the Institutional Revolutionary
Party. Standing on a sidewalk above a street that is now a roiling
river, a crowd of residents began to shout that the mayor was
keeping relief aid for his cronies.
</P>
<P>
   But Roberto Velazquez Verdugo, 48, stepped forward to identify
himself unabashedly as a crony of the mayor. Yet, he said, he had
received nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Then they all calmed down and turned to watch the waters rising
inexorably up the walls of Velazquez's house. It was still raining.

LEIBOWITZ-COLUMN (Phoenix) - Now every eye shifts east, toward
Pennsylvania Avenue and Bill Clinton, unzipped, unraveled. In my
business, the choices are two: Wallow in 445 pages of pornography,
or take a walk on Hadley Street. It is a frayed ribbon of poverty,
a street of lives as hard as the Oval Office is plush. By night,
they sometimes hear gangbangers' gunshots. By day, on this Friday,
no one speaks the name Clinton until I speak it myself. By DAVID

   WASHINGTON _ Republicans and Democrats alike said Friday that
while there were no stunning revelations, they were deeply troubled
and distressed by details in the report by Kenneth Starr, the
Whitewater independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   But while Democrats were reluctant to defend President Clinton's
behavior as outlined in the report, the initial reaction from both
parties suggested that partisan battle lines were beginning to
emerge: Democrats accused Starr of overreaching by dwelling on
lurid sexual details, and Republicans sought to shift the debate to
the report's conclusions about perjury, obstruction of justice and
witness tampering.
</P>
<P>
   ``The misjudgments of the president are nearly equaled by the
need of Kenneth Starr to provide a level of sexual detail beyond
what was necessary to make his point or establish his case,'' said
Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J. ``His own lack of perspective and
tendency to go to excess undermines his credibility. This level of
sexual detail is clearly intended to inflame public passions.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, who is a member of the Judiciary
Committee, said he was particularly concerned not by the sexual
details but the other evidence. ``The allegations are far more
serious than I had anticipated,'' he said. ``You've got five
allegations of lying under oath; four allegations of obstructing
justice. I think it's more likely than not that the Judiciary
Committee as a whole would recommend that the House consider
initiating the impeachment inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who is chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, also sought to dispel the notion that the
report was only about sex. ``Some will try to make this just purely
a sexual matter,'' he said. ``And they'll try to say this is purely
a private matter. But I don't see anything that I've read so far
that indicates that Judge Starr is saying that he should be
impeached because of the sexual relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as he focused on the non-sexual allegations, Rep. Thomas
Davis, D-Va., did not shy from mentioning the ``very lurid and
graphic details'' in the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``These details will offend most Americans,'' Davis said.
``While demeaning to the institution of the presidency, these
details, alone, do not constitute impeachable offenses. However, if
proven true, the allegations in Judge Starr's report, such as
witness tampering and lying under oath to the grand jury, do
constitute impeachable offenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that Democrats would cast the report as needlessly
digging into Clinton's private conduct with Ms. Lewinsky, some
Republicans said they wished Starr had written been more broadly
about other issues that had been under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The allegation of abuse of office could yet be strengthened by
evidence of the president's role in Travelgate and Filegate and the
other matters under the jurisdiction of the independent counsel,''
said Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y. ``The sexual part of it, the unseemly
part, gives us pause but that is not a ground for impeachment. But
the other stuff potentially is.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the few Democrats who spoke out forcefully in defense of
Clinton was Rep. Robert Wexler of Florida, a member of the
Judiciary Committee, who sought to portray the report as
preoccupied with sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not make more of it than it is,'' he said. ``The
president didn't do what Lyndon Johnson did and lie about Vietnam.
President Clinton did not do what Ronald Reagan did and probably
lie about hostages and arms. The president lied about an
extra-marital affair _ let's put this in context.''

CONGRESS LEFT WITH SOBERING TASK IN WAKE OF REPORT'S RELEASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Members of Congress voted to release the
independent counsel's report to the world Friday and then rushed
out of town without reading a word of the graphic depiction of
President Clinton's affair with a White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   For a few more hours, lawmakers could legitimately plead
ignorance of the details of Starr's report and buy a little more
time before grappling with the task of determining whether Clinton
committed impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The depiction of Clinton's illicit sexual affair with young
White House aide Monica Lewinsky left members of Congress sobered
and concerned Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress pledged to conduct a judicious and
deliberate review of the report as it hit the Internet, but many
Democrats complained the Republican majority was being unfair at
the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed,'' said Representative Barney Frank of
Massachusetts, the No. 2 Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee.
``The decision by the Republicans to not allow the president to
look at this material when it will be sitting here for two weeks is
a sign that they are playing gotcha. I think they are afraid that
they have a weak case.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were more reserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information is out there, let the facts come forward,''
said Representative Rosa DeLauro, the Connecticut Democrat. ``I
take this very, very seriously. This has got to be an impartial
process. We cannot go about the business of overturning an election
any other way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish that the president had it two days in advance so that
he could respond to these charges,'' said Representative Edward J.
Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat. ``I am going to read this report
very carefully in order to determine whether or not Ken Starr has
identified any impeachable offense.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; (begin optional trim) &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Six members of the Massachusetts congressional delegation voted
against making the report public, largely to protest the failure of
the Republican majority to give Clinton advance notice of its
contents. They were Representatives William Delahunt, Frank, and
Martin Meehan, all members of the House Judiciary Committee, and
Joseph P. Kennedy II, Markey, and Richard Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Voting in favor were: Representatives James McGovern and John
Tierney, both first-termers, J. Joseph Moakley and John Olver of
Amherst.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy said,``I have not read the report so
it would be premature to speculate about its contents. Congress has
a clear responsibility to deal with the report fairly and
responsibly. The president deserves a fair opportunity to respond
to all aspects of the report.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry, as well as Meehan, Tierney and Delahunt,
reserved comment until after reading the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process has started and it will take a long time,'' said
Olver. ``To be credible, it has to be very judicious.''
</P>
<P>
   McGovern said, ``This is a very serious and important moment in
the country, and a process has begun and we need to make sure that
process is fair, objective and nonpartisan. Ken Starr has presented
his case, and the president will present his. There will probably
be hearings next year. I know there is a temptation to rush to
judgment and jump to conclusions, but to be responsible we have to
resist that. ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; (end optional trim) &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Representative John Linder of Georgia, who chairs the National
Republican Campaign Committee, said he thought the public would be
disgusted by the contents of the report and predicted Clinton's
defenders would try to discredit its conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Robert Barr, the Georgia Republican who filed
legislation last year to launch an impeachment inquiry against
Clinton for unspecified ``crimes.'' said: ``I'm pleased that the
process of accountability is moving forward and the process is
moving as it should be. My main concern now is getting through the
mountainous material before us,''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this Congress will proceed in a fair, impartial and
bipartisan way,'' said Representative Charles Bass, the New
Hampshire Republican. ``I was troubled by the partisanship of the
debate. The issue is what is in the report and how Congress
proceeds. It's important we do not allow this issue to subsume what
else we have to do in this Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a solemn but serious business,'' said Representative
Charles Canady, a Florida Republican who serves on the House
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This alleges perjury in a civil case that was thrown out. I
don't know who would prosecute that in the real world,'' said
Representative Eliot Engel, the New York Democrat.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On a day in which the people most involved in the
crisis engulfing the Clinton presidency seemed to be out in full
force, with visible public schedules or serving up interpretations
of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's report, one notable
exception was the woman whose story touched off the maelstrom:
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Ms. Lewinsky nor anyone close to the 25-year-old former
White House intern went before cameras to discuss her reactions,
even as the most intimate details of her private life became even
more public. Her last known public appearance was in late August,
when she testified before the grand jury in the Ken Starr
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   And though Clinton apologized publicly to Ms. Lewinsky for the
first time Friday, Judy Smith, the spokeswoman for Ms. Lewinsky,
said that Ms. Lewinsky and her family had no comment on the
president's apology.

REPORT SKIPS `TRAVELGATE,' `FILEGATE,' WHITEWATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nowhere in his 445-page report does independent
counsel Kenneth W. Starr lay out charges against President Clinton
regarding Whitewater, the complex land and banking deal that
sparked Starr's four-year, $35 million investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the report focus on two other alleged scandals that
Starr was authorized to examine: ``travelgate,'' as the 1993 firing
of the White House travel office staff became known, and
``filegate,'' the improper appearance at the White House of
hundreds of personal FBI files on Republican political appointees.
</P>
<P>
   But the meaning of Starr's silence on these matters is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   His office is obligated to report any conduct to Congress that
might be considered an impeachable offense. Allies of the president
said Friday that Starr, by reporting solely on Clinton's
relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, has shown that his long
investigation has turned up no wrongoing by Clinton regarding
Whitewater, the travel office or the FBI files.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr, in his report, said he had made no decision on how to
handle those other matters. ``All phases of the investigation are
now nearing completion,'' he said in the report to Congress.
Decisions about Whitewater and other investigations ``will be made
at the earliest practical time.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr may well issue a second report to Congress on Whitewater
and other matters, and he may even win indictments soon in those
cases, said Joseph diGenova, a former US attorney and former
independent counsel who examined Bush administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   DiGenova said Starr's office had submitted papers in a civil
suit recently saying it is at a ``sensitive'' stage in several
investigations. ``That is classic prosecutor language saying they
are making decisions about whether to indict someone,'' diGenova
said. ``People are making mistakes in saying this is over. The
available tea leaves are not indicative of an investigation coming
to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   While Starr is charged with referring potentially impeachable
offenses to Congress, he is required to submit a report on all
parts of his investigation to a special three-judge panel that
oversees independent counsels.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's office, in its report to Congress, said it had a
``strong desire'' to complete all phases of the investigation
before deciding what to report to Congress. But the Lewinsky matter
produced ``a significant body'' of possibly impeachable conduct by
the president, the report said. It would have been ``unwise'' to
delay reporting that material in order to complete other aspects of
the investigation, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers, however, said Friday that by focusing
on the Lewinsky matter, Starr showed that his investigation has
veered widely off course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's Whitewater? ... What began as an inquiry into a
24-year-old land deal in Arkansas has ended as an inquest into
brief, improper personal encounters between the President and
Monica Lewinsky,'' said a 78-page rebuttal to the Starr report,
which was written by the office of the White House counsel and
Clinton's private lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The rebuttal also noted that the president has ``cooperated
extensively'' with Starr's probe of Whitewater. The president gave
testimony by deposition on four occasions, give videotaped
depositions for Whitewater defendents on two other occasions and
produced more than 90,000 pages of documents.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's investigation of Whitewater and related matters has
produced five guilty pleas on fraud and other charges, including
those of former Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker and of James and
Susan McDougal, the Clintons' former business partners in the
Whitewater deal.
</P>
<P>
   The judicial panel appointed Starr to the Whitewater
investigation in 1994, replacing Robert Fiske Jr. Starr was
directed to examine whether the Clintons or McDougals personally
benefited from an illegal $300,000 federal loan in 1986 from
Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan, which James McDougal owned and
which later failed.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also wanted to know if Clinton misused his role as
governor of Arkansas to secure a loan for the McDougals, and they
wanted to examine the legal work that Mrs. Clinton did on behalf of
Madison. Questions about Mrs. Clinton's role only became more
prominent after long-sought records from her Arkansas law firm
mysteriously turned up at the White House residence in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the three-judge panel authorized Starr to examine
``travelgate,'' the firing of staff at the White House travel
office. Starr was asked to look into the possibility that White
House officials or Mrs. Clinton lied about who ordered the
dismissals.
</P>
<P>
   The judicial panel also authorized Starr that year to
investigate ``filegate,'' the matter of confidential FBI files on
GOP political appointees turning up at the White House. The White
House said mistakes had been made in handling the files, but no
crimes were committed.
</P>
<P>
   Those investigations have produced no indictments.

</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday defeated an attempt to bring campaign
finance legislation up for a final vote. The 52-48 majority in
favor of voting on reform fell short of the 60 votes needed to beat
back a Republican-led filibuster. The reform bill, sponsored by
Sen. Russell D. Feingold, D-Wis., and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
would have banned the unlimited and unregulated soft money
contributions to political parties and would have restricted issue
ads. Supporters said the bill is necessary to prevent the abuses
that arose in the 1996 campaign. Opponents argued that such
restrictions are a violation of the free speech guarantee under the
Constitution. A ``yes'' vote favors bringing the issue to a vote.

THE PRESIDENT'S RESPONSE TO THE STARR REPORT  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from the White House's
preliminary response to the report of the Whitewater independent
counsel, Kenneth Starr. It was issued by President Clinton's
lawyers today before they received a copy of the report.
</P>
<P>
   Summary of key points of the president's case in anticipation of
the Starr report:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1. The president has acknowledged a serious mistake &LR;  _ an
inappropriate relationship with Monica Lewinsky. He has taken
responsibility for his actions, and he has apologized to the
country, to his friends, leaders of his party, the Cabinet and most
importantly, his family.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2. This private mistake does not amount to an impeachable
action. &LR;  A relationship outside one's marriage is wrong _ and the
president admits that. It is not a high crime or misdemeanor. The
Constitution specifically states that Congress shall impeach only
for ``treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors.''
These words in the Constitution were chosen with great care, and
after extensive deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 3. ``High crimes and misdemeanors'' had a fixed meaning to the
Framers of our Constitution _ it meant wrongs committed against our
system of government. &LR;  The impeachment clause was designed to
protect our country against a president who was using his official
powers against the nation, against the American people, against our
society. It was never designed to allow a political body to force a
president from office for a very personal mistake.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 4. Remember _ this report is based entirely on allegations
obtained by a grand jury &LR;  _ Reams and reams of allegations and
purported ``evidence'' that would never be admitted in court, that
has never been seen by the president or his lawyers, and that was
not subject to cross-examination or any other traditional
safeguards to insure its credibility.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 5. Grand juries are not designed to search for truth. &LR;  They do
not and are not intended to insure credibility, reliability, or
simple fairness. They only exist to accuse. Yet this is the process
that the Independent Counsel has chosen to provide the ``evidence''
to write his report.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 6. The law defines perjury very clearly. &LR;  Perjury requires
proof that an individual knowingly made a false statement while
under oath. Answers to questions that are literally true are not
perjury. Even if an answer doesn't directly answer the question
asked, it is not perjury if it is true _ no accused has an
obligation to help his accuser. Answers to fundamentally ambiguous
questions also can never be perjury. And nobody can be convicted of
perjury based on only one other person's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 7. The president did not commit perjury. Most of the illegal
leaks suggesting his testimony was perjurious falsely describe his
testimony. &LR;  First of all, the president never testified in the
Jones deposition that he was not alone with Ms. Lewinsky. The
president never testified that his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky
was the same as with any other intern. To the contrary, he admitted
exchanging gifts with her, knowing about her job search, receiving
cards and notes from her, and knowing other details of her personal
life that made it plain he had a special relationship with her.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 8. The president has admitted he had an improper sexual
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. &LR;  In a civil deposition, he gave
narrow answers to ambiguous questions. As a matter of law, those
answers could not give rise to a criminal charge of perjury. In the
face of the president's admission of his relationship, the
disclosure of lurid and salacious allegations can only be intended
to humiliate the president and force him from office.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 9. There was no obstruction of justice. We believe Betty Currie
testified that Ms. Lewinsky asked her to hold the gifts and that
the president never talked to her about the gifts. &LR;  The president
admitted giving and receiving gifts from Ms. Lewinsky when he was
asked about it. The president never asked Ms. Lewinsky to get rid
of the gifts and he never asked Ms. Currie to get them. We believe
that Ms. Currie's testimony supports the president's.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 10. The president never tried to get Ms. Lewinsky a job after
she left the White House in order to influence her testimony in the
Paula Jones case. &LR;  The president knew Ms. Lewinsky was unhappy in
her Pentagon job after she left the White House and did ask the
White House personnel office to treat her fairly in her job search.
He never instructed anyone to hire her, or even indicated that he
very much wanted it to happen. Ms. Lewinsky was never offered a job
at the White House after she left _ and it's pretty apparent that
if the president had ordered it, she would have been.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 11. The president did not facilitate Ms. Lewinsky's interview
with Bill Richardson or her discussions with Vernon Jordan. &LR;  Betty
Currie asked John Podesta if he could help her with her New York
job search, which led to an interview with Bill Richardson, and Ms.
Currie also put her in touch with her longtime friend Mr. Jordan.
Mr. Jordan has made it clear that this is the case, and, as a
private individual, he is free to offer job advice wherever he sees
fit.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 12. There was no witness tampering. Betty Currie was not
supposed to be a witness in the Paula Jones case. &LR;  If she was not
called or going to be called, it was impossible for any
conversations the president had with her to be witness tampering.
The president testified that he did not in any way attempt to
influence her recollection.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 13. There is no ``talking points'' smoking gun. &LR;  Numerous
illegal leaks painted the mysterious talking points as the proof
that the president or his staff attempted to suborn the perjury of
Monica Lewinsky or Linda Tripp. The OIC's spokesman said that the
``talking points'' were the ``key'' to Starr even being granted
authority to investigate the president's private life. Yet, in the
end, Ms. Lewinsky has apparently admitted the talking points were
written by her alone (or with Ms. Tripp's assistance), and the
president was not asked one single question about them in his grand
jury appearance.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 14. Invocation of privileges was not an abuse of power. &LR;  The
president's lawful assertion of privileges in a court of law was
only made on the advice of his counsel and was in significant
measure validated by the courts. The legal claims were advanced
sparingly and as a last resort, after all attempts at compromise by
the White House counsel's office were rejected to protect the core
constitutional and institutional interests of this and future
presidencies.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 15. Neither the president nor the White House played a role in
the Secret Service's lawful efforts to prevent agents from
testifying to preserve its protective function. &LR;  The president
never asked, directed or participated in any decision regarding the
protective-function privilege. Neither did any White House
official. The Treasury and Justice Departments independently
decided to respond to the historically unprecedented subpoenas of
Secret Service personnel and to pursue the privilege to insure the
protection of this and future presidents.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 16. The president did not abuse his power by permitting White
House staff to comment on the investigation. &LR;  The president has
acknowledged misleading his family, staff and the country about the
nature of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, and he has apologized
and asked for forgiveness. However, this personal failing does not
constitute a criminal abuse of power. If allowing aides to repeat
misleading statements is a crime, then any number of public
officials are guilty of misusing their office for as long as they
fail to admit wrongdoing in response to any allegation about their
activities.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 17. The actions of White House attorneys were completely
lawful &LR; . The White House counsel attorneys provided the president
and White House officials with informed, candid advice on issues
raised during this investigation that affected the president's
official duties. This was especially necessary given the fact that
impeachment proceedings against the president were a possible
result of the OIC's investigation from Day One. In fact, throughout
the investigation, the OIC relied on the White House counsel's
office for assistance in gathering information and arranging
interviews and grand jury appearances. The counsel's office's
actions were well known to the OIC throughout the investigation,
and no objection was ever voiced.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; This means that the OIC report is left with nothing but the
details of a private sexual relationship, told in graphic details
with the intent to embarrass. &LR;  Given the flimsy and unsubstantiated
basis for the accusations, there is a complete lack of any credible
evidence to initiate an impeachment inquiry concerning the
president. And the principal purpose of this investigation, and the
OIC's report, is to embarrass the president and titillate the
public by producing a document that is little more than an
unreliable, one-sided account of sexual behavior.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Where's Whitewater? &LR;  The OIC's allegations reportedly include
no suggestion of wrongdoing by the president in any of the areas
which Mr. Starr spent four years investigating: Whitewater, the FBI
files and the White House travel office. What began as an inquiry
into a 24-year-old land deal in Arkansas has ended as an inquest
into brief, improper personal encounters between the president and
Monica Lewinsky. Despite the exhaustive nature of the OIC's
investigation into the Whitewater, FBI files and travel office
matters, and a constant stream of suggestions of misconduct in the
media over a period of years, to this day the OIC has never
exonerated the president or the first lady of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Preliminary Memorandum Concerning Referral Of Office of
Independent Counsel &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This document is intended to be a preliminary response to the
referral submitted by the Office of Independent Counsel to the
Congress. Because we were denied the opportunity to review the
content, nature or specifics of the allegations made against the
president by the Office of Independent Counsel (OIC), we do not
pretend to offer a point-by-point refutation of those allegations,
or a comprehensive defense of the president.
</P>
<P>
   We commend the House of Representatives for the extraordinary
steps it has taken to safeguard the secrecy of the OIC's
allegations. Unfortunately, its efforts were thwarted by unnamed
sources familiar with the details of the OIC's allegations _
sources that could only come from the OIC itself _ who saw fit to
leak elements of the allegations to the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Based on these illegal leaks, as well as our knowledge of the
president's testimony, we offer this document as a summary outline
of his side of the case. We will provide you with a specific
rebuttal as soon as we have had a chance to review the materials
that the OIC has already transmitted to you.
</P>
<P>
   The simple reality of this situation is that the House is being
confronted with evidence of a man's efforts to keep an
inappropriate relationship private. A personal failure that the
president has acknowledged was wrong, for which he apologized, and
for which he accepts complete responsibility. A personal failure
for which the president has sought forgiveness from members of his
family, members of the Cabinet, members of Congress and the
American people. Such a personal failing does not, however,
constitute ``treason, bribery and high crimes and misdemeanors''
that would justify the impeachment of the president of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The president himself has described his conduct as wrong. But no
amount of gratuitous details about the president's relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky, no matter how salacious, can alter the fact
that:
</P>
<P>
   1) the president did not commit perjury;
</P>
<P>
   2) the president did not obstruct justice;
</P>
<P>
   3) the president did not tamper with witnesses; and
</P>
<P>
   4) the president did not abuse the power of his office.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment is a matter of incomparable gravity. Even to discuss
it is to discuss overturning the electoral will of the people. For
this reason, the framers made clear, and scholars have long agreed,
that the power should be exercised only in the event of such grave
harms to the state as ``serious assaults on the integrity of the
processes of government,'' or ``such crimes as would so stain a
president as to make his continuance in office dangerous to public
order.'' We do not believe the OIC can identify any conduct
remotely approaching this standard. Instead, from press reports, if
true, it appears that the OIC has dangerously overreached to
describe in the most dramatic of terms conduct that not only is not
criminal but is actually proper and lawful.
</P>
<P>
   The president has confessed to indiscretions with Ms. Lewinsky
and accepted responsibility and blame. The allegations concerning
obstruction, intimidation, perjury and subornation of perjury that
we anticipate from the OIC are extravagant attempts to transform a
case involving inappropriate personal behavior into one of public
misconduct justifying reversal of the judgment of the electorate of
this country.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Standards For Impeachment &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution provides that the president shall be removed
from office only upon ``Impeachment for, and Conviction of,
Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' Of
course, there is no suggestion of treason or bribery present here.
Therefore, the question confronting the House of Representatives is
whether the president has committed a ``high crime or
misdemeanor.'' The House has an obligation to consider the evidence
in view of that very high constitutional threshold. It should
pursue the impeachment process only if there is evidence
implicating that high standard.
</P>
<P>
   The House must approach the question with solemnity and with
care, for history teaches that an ``impeachable offense'' is no
ordinary kind of wrongdoing. The framers included specific
provisions for impeachment in the Constitution itself because they
understood that the most severe political remedy was necessary to
remedy the most serious forms of public wrongdoing. Impeachment is
a basic constitutional safeguard, designed both to correct harms to
the system of government itself and to protect the people from
ongoing malfeasance. Nothing less than the gravest executive
wrongdoing can justify impeachment. The Constitution leaves lesser
wrongs to the political process and to public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential impeachment is thus a matter of incomparable
gravity. As Professor Charles Black stated: ``The presidency is a
prime symbol of our national unity. The election of the president
(with his alternate, the Vice president) is the only political act
that we perform together as a nation; voting in the presidential
election is certainly the political choice most significant to the
American people, and the most closely attended to by them. No
matter, then, can be of higher political importance than our
considering whether, in any given instance, this act of choice is
to be undone, and the chosen president dismissed from office in
disgrace. Everyone must shrink from this most drastic of measures.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Impeachment: A Handbook 1 (1974). &LR;  Presidential impeachment is
thus an ``awful step.'' The framers knew this. For that reason they
framed the constitutional procedure with precision and specified
grounds for impeachment with great care.
</P>
<P>
   The framers deliberately chose to make ``high crimes and
misdemeanors'' the standard of an impeachable offense. They were
familiar with English common law and parliamentary history and they
borrowed the expression directly from the English law of
impeachment. They did so knowing that the expression was a term of
art and they made the choice after deliberate rejection of
alternative formulations of the impeachment standard.
</P>
<P>
   The framers intended the standard to be a high one. They
rejected a proposal that the president be impeachable for
``maladministration,'' for, as James Madison pointed out, such a
standard would ``be equivalent to a tenure during the pleasure of
the Senate.'' The framers plainly did not intend to permit Congress
to debilitate the executive by authorizing impeachment for
something short of the most serious harm to the state. In George
Mason's apt phrase, impeachment was thought necessary to remedy
``[a)ttempts to subvert the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   In English practice, the term ``high crimes and misdemeanors''
had been applied to various offenses, the common elements of which
were their severity and the fact that the wrongdoing was directed
against the state. The English cases included misappropriation of
public funds, interfering in elections, accepting bribes, neglect
of duty and various forms of corruption. These offenses all
affected the discharge of public duties by public officials. In
short, under the English practice, ``the critical element of injury
in an impeachable offense was injury to the state.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why, at the time of the ratification debates, Alexander
Hamilton described impeachment as a ``method of national inquest
into the conduct of public men.'' This ``inquest'' is perhaps the
gravest process known to our Constitution. No act touches more
fundamental questions of constitutional government than does the
process of presidential impeachment. No act more directly affects
the public interest. No act presents the potential for greater
injustice _ injustice both to the chief executive and to the people
who elected him.

ON HADLEY STREET, CLINTON IS NOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID LEIBOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Now every eye shifts east, toward Pennsylvania Avenue
and Bill Clinton, unzipped, unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   In my business, the choices are two: Wallow in 445 pages of
pornography, or take a walk. It is an easy decision, no tougher
saying Clinton has no choice but to resign. I know a street that
beckons, a few miles to the south, within sight of downtown
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Hadley Street, it's called.
</P>
<P>
   It is a frayed ribbon of poverty, a strip of shingle roofs and
plywood-boarded doors, a street of lives as hard as the Oval Office
is plush. By night, they sometimes hear gangbangers' gunshots. By
day, on this Friday, no one speaks the name Clinton until I speak
it myself.
</P>
<P>
   This omission can be easily explained. Travel from Hadley Street
to D.C. might as well be interplanetary. The only mouth of concern
here belongs not to an intern, but to a son or daughter.
</P>
<P>
   In a lot along 11th Avenue, Michael Mulligan rakes trash in the
rain.
</P>
<P>
   The maintenance man has two kids at home, ages 14 and 8, plus
four grown-up children besides. He's 44, and on a good week, one
where he clocks 40 hours, he makes $400. That pays the bills, and
leaves a few bucks to scrounge computer parts. He has built seven
machines from scratch, self-taught. It's what he turns to when the
news turns to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays, they always go with violence, not the human interest
stories like they should,'' he says. ``There's lots of people out
here in the real world, trying to make it and do better.''
</P>
<P>
   Lots and lots. Ones who've never obstructed justice or committed
perjury. Ones who work, tough it out, retire, tough it out some
more. Ones like Joe Thomas, who lives on Hadley near 15th Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   He was the mop man on a roofing crew for 36 years, swabbing
425-degree tar on 120-degree days. They made him quit a few years
ago, at 67, when he fell off a roof and busted up his feet. Now
he's 74; the monthly Social Security check totals $950. To take his
mind off it, he fishes. He reels in bass the way Clinton reeled in
his intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, I didn't worry none about him,'' says Joe. ``I'm just
trying to make it through these days.''
</P>
<P>
   That takes all the concentration they have on Hadley Street, in
a neighborhood that collects ills like a gutter collects drizzle:
There are three housing projects and four shelters within walking
distance, each dripping with addicts, transients, poverty. Last
week, 250 cops came in with a tank and machine guns. Yesterday on
17th Avenue, dealers sold crack while sitting on toppled shopping
carts.
</P>
<P>
   In the Matthew Henson projects, Louise Cheney did laundry while
her 5-year-old boy and her neighbor's kids played on a patch of
grass. She drew babysitting detail by default: They laid her off at
the uniform factory last week. Goodbye, 6 dollars an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The son, Phillip, races in to shake the visitor's hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to move him out of here,'' Louise says. ``It's not a
good environment for kids to grow up in. There's a lot of bums, a
lot of prostitutes, there's been stabbings. I worry about that
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   While fretting over Clinton not at all.
</P>
<P>
   It is a little different on Grant, a few corners over. There,
Felton King runs a metal finishing plant. He employs four, and
worries about making payroll. He has four daughters, and worries
about paying tuition. His father, age 83, pastors a church on
Buckeye Road. Felton, the son, worries about the crack house next
door.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he finds slivers of time for thoughts of Pennsylvania
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pray for him every day,'' says Felton King. ``But as for
worrying about his plight, Mr. Clinton is one of the things that
are least of my priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   That thought lives all along Hadley Street, wherever Bill
Clinton is not. Somewhere, a billion eyes have turned east. Those
eyes, feet, strong backs, might be better used someplace else.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be glad to have 'em down here,'' says Felton King,
nodding his head. ``Glad to have 'em.'' &QL;

 WASHINGTON: elected him.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For these reasons, the impeachment process must be painstaking
and deliberate. It must focus only on such harms as the framers
intended to be redressed by the incomparably severe act of
impeachment. And most importantly, it must be understood for what
it is _ a process of inquiry. That process is itself the exercise
of a public trust ``of delicacy and magnitude.'' Accordingly, if
the process is begun it is only just that the members engaged in
this solemn task withhold judgment until the process is complete
and all the facts are known. Our Constitution's most basic values
and the requirements of simple justice together demand no less.
</P>
<P>
   The president is sole head of one branch of our government _
indeed, in a certain sense the president is the executive branch.
The Constitution provides that ``[t)he executive power shall be
vested in a president of the United States of America.'' The
president is the only government official to have been popularly
elected by all the American people. When the people elect a
president, the popular will is expressed in its most important,
most visible and most unmistakable form. The impeachment process,
by definition, threatens to undo the popular will. Impeachment
presents the prospect of reversing the electoral mandate that
brought the executive to office. Conviction upon articles of
impeachment actually does so.
</P>
<P>
   For these reasons, impeachment is limited to only certain forms
of potential wrongdoing and it is intended to redress only certain
kinds of harms. Again, in Hamilton's words: ``The subjects of [the
Senate's impeachment) jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed
from the misconduct of public men, or in other words from the abuse
of violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may
with peculiar propriety be denominated political, as they relate
chiefly to injuries done to the society itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The framers and early commentators on the Constitution are in
accord on the question of impeachment's intended consequence. In
Justice James Wilson's words, impeachments are ``proceedings of a
political nature ... confined to political characters'' charging
only ``political crimes and misdemeanors'' and culminating only in
``political punishments.'' And as Justice Story put the matter,
``The [impeachment) power partakes of a political character, as it
respects injuries to the society in its political character.'' That
understanding of the framers and early commentators reflected the
historical understanding of impeachable offenses in England. ``
`High crimes and misdemeanors' were a category of political crimes
against the state.'' Therefore, the framers ``intended that a
president be removable from office for the commission of great
offenses against the Constitution.'' Impeachment therefore
addresses public wrongdoing, whether denominated a ``political
crime (against the state,)'' or ``an act of malfeasance or abuse of
office,'' or a `great offense[s) against the Federal government.''
In short, impeachment is a necessary Constitutional check by a
coordinate branch of government upon serious and aggravated abuses
of executive power that, given the president's four-year term,
might otherwise go unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   Holders of public office are therefore not to be impeached for
private conduct, however wrongful. To the contrary, only ``serious
assaults on the integrity of the processes of government,'' and
``such crimes as would so stain a president as to make his
continuance in office dangerous to public order'' should constitute
impeachable offenses. Conduct which is not an ``offense against the
government,'' or ``malfeasance or abuse of office,'' and which
bears no ``functional relationship'' to public office, does not
constitute grounds for impeachment. Allegations concerning private
conduct _ private sexual conduct in particular _ simply do not
implicate high crimes or misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
   Private misconduct, or even public misconduct short of an
offense against the state, is not redressable by impeachment
because that solemn process, in Justice Story's words, addresses
``offenses which are committed by public men in violation of their
public trust and duties.'' Impeachment is a political act in the
sense that its aims are public; it attempts to rein in abuses of
the public trust committed by public officeholders in connection
with conduct in public office. As one scholar has put it, ``the
nature of [impeachment) proceedings is dictated by the harms sought
to be redressed _ ``the misconduct of public men'' relating to the
conduct of their public office _ and the ultimate issue to be
resolved _ whether they have forfeited through that conduct their
right to continued public trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment's public character is further evidenced by the fact
that, as Justice Story expressed it, the process is conducted ``by
the representatives of the nation, in their public capacity,'' and
``in the face of the nation.'' Constitutionally, impeachment's
public function demands public accountability. Elected officials
are no more qualified than ordinary voters to assess the private
wrongs of public officeholders. The Constitution's impeachment
mechanism does not exist to punish such wrongs.
</P>
<P>
   The public character of impeachable wrongs is also reflected in
the fact that the remedy imposed for commission of impeachable acts
is a wholly public one. Impeachment results in removal from office
and possible disqualification from further office.
</P>
<P>
   To say that impeachment is fundamentally a ``political''
process, however, is not to say that it is ``partisan'' in nature.
Indeed, the framers warned against the spirit of partisanship in
impeachment proceedings. In Federalist 65, Hamilton wrote that the
impeachment process threatened to ``agitate the passions of the
whole community ... to divide it into parties ... [to) connect
itself with pre-existing factions [and) to enlist their
animosities, partialities, influence and interest.'' Justice Story
warned of the danger that ``the decision [to impeach) will be
regulated more by the comparative strength of the parties, than by
the strength of the proofs.'' Only substantial evidence of
presidential wrongdoing that threatened the processes of government
or the public order can justify this grave and ideally bipartisan
process.

 WASHINGTON: bipartisan process.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What is ultimately intended by impeachment's truly ``political''
nature is the manner of limitation the Constitution allows one
elected (political) branch to place on the other elected
(political) branch, the presidency. Impeachment is necessarily a
public act conducted by public bodies (the Houses of Congress
exercising their constitutionally allotted portion of impeachment
power) against a public officeholder (here, the president).
Exercise of that limiting function is justified only when the
people's representatives conclude that the people themselves must
be protected from their own elected executive.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment must therefore be approached with the utmost
solemnity. The process must focus on public acts, performed in the
president's public capacity, and affecting the public interest.
Cognizant of the enormous harm that must follow the bare suggestion
of formal impeachment processes, the House should pursue an
impeachment inquiry if and only if there is credible evidence of
actions constituting fundamental injuries to the governmental
process. Indeed, the committee should consider and approve articles
of impeachment only for such acts as have, in its judgment, so
seriously threatened the integrity of governmental processes as to
have made the president's continuation in office a threat to the
public order.
</P>
<P>
   Impropriety falling short of that high standard does not meet
the constitutional measure. It must be left to the court of public
opinion and the judgment of history.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Relevant Factual Background &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Monica Lewinsky investigation is the most recent phase of an
amorphous, languorous, expensive and seemingly interminable
investigation into the affairs of a small Arkansas real estate
firm, Whitewater Development Company Inc. In January 1994, Attorney
General Reno made an administrative appointment (the Ethics in
Government Act of 1978 having expired) of Robert B. Fiske Jr. to
investigate the relationship of the President and Mrs. Clinton to
Whitewater, Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association and
Capital Management Services. After the re-enactment of the Ethics
in Government Act, the Special Division for the Purpose of
Appointing Independent Counsels of the Court of Appeals appointed
Kenneth W. Starr, a former high official in two Republican
Administrations, to replace Mr. Fiske on Aug. 5, 1994, and gave him
a generally similar grant of investigatory jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   During the past four and a half years, the president has
cooperated extensively with this investigation. He has given
testimony by deposition at the White House to the independent
counsel on four separate occasions, and on two other occasions, he
gave videotaped deposition testimony for Whitewater defendants and
was cross-examined by the independent counsel. He has submitted
written interrogatory answers, produced more than 90,000 pages of
documents and other items and provided information informally in a
variety of ways. The OIC subpoenaed from the president, and
reviewed, virtually every personal financial record and
gubernatorial campaign finance record that exists for the period
from the mid-1980's to the present, in its endless search to find
something to use against the president. This comprehensive and
thorough financial review yielded the OIC nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1994, president Clinton was sued civilly by Ms. Paula
Jones, who made various claims arising out of an encounter on May
8, 1991, when the president was governor of Arkansas. Various
constitutional questions were litigated, and it was not until the
Supreme Court's decision on May 27, 1997, that the case proceeded
to discovery. The independent counsel had no jurisdiction with
respect to the Jones case, but there were occasional press reports
that the OIC was in fact investigating the president's personal
life. ...
</P>
<P>
   It is not true that the president had an improper 18-month
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, as several media reports have
alleged. In his grand jury deposition, he testified that on certain
occasions in early 1996 and once in early 1997, he engaged in
improper conduct with Ms. Lewinsky. These encounters did not
consist of sexual intercourse, and they did not consist of ``sexual
relations'' as he understood that term to be defined at his Jones
deposition on Jan. 17, 1998, but they did involve inappropriate
intimate contact. These inappropriate encounters ended, at the
president's insistence, in early 1997, not because of the imminence
of discovery, not because of the Jones case (which the Supreme
Court had not yet decided), but because he knew they were wrong. On
Aug. 17, 1998, the president expressed regret to the grand jury
and, later, to the country, that what began as a friendship came to
include this conduct, and he took full responsibility. He has
frequently, to different audiences, made similar expressions of
regret and apology.
</P>
<P>
   In this investigation, no stone has been left unturned _ or (we
believe) unthrown. In simple fairness, therefore, it is important
to distinguish between what the president has acknowledged and what
the OIC merely alleges (on the basis of evidence we have not yet
seen).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Nature of the OIC's Evidence &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Use of a Federal grand jury to compile evidence for possible
impeachment proceedings in Congress raises numerous troubling
questions regarding the credibility of that evidence. Indeed, given
the limited role of a grand jury in our system and the total
absence of procedural protections in the process, the independent
counsel's insistence that his investigation has been a search for
``truth'' is deeply misleading. In fact, it has been a one-sided
effort to present the worst possible version of a limited set of
facts.
</P>
<P>
   Section 595(c) requires the OIC to provide the House with
``substantial and credible information ... that may constitute
grounds for impeachment.'' But a grand jury is a totally unsuitable
vehicle for generating information that can, without more, be taken
as credible beyond challenge. The grand jury's historic role is not
to determine the truth but rather to act as an accusatory body. The
process excludes contrary views of the information gathered and
fails to identify the kinds of exculpatory information that might
have been elicited or presented had a targeted individual, and not
just the OIC, had an opportunity to cross-examine and the ability
to compel responses.

 WASHINGTON: compel responses.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because it is inherently so one-sided and untested by
cross-examination, it normally is not permissible to use grand jury
testimony as a basis for anything other than permitting a grand
jury to indict or decline to indict. It may constitute nothing more
than hearsay or even multiple hearsay _ evidence which would likely
be excluded from a trial. Indeed, the information a grand jury
gathers is not circumscribed by the Federal Rules of Evidence at
all, nor delimited by the other safeguards of reliability which
would be enforced at trial. The testimony a grand jury elicits is
not subject to impeachment by interested parties, and such
testimony may come from immunized witnesses, from witnesses who
fear prosecution, from witnesses prepared by the prosecution, from
witnesses with a history of untruthfulness _ or from disinterested
witnesses. On the record of the grand jury there need be no
distinction among these sources, despite the fact that their
reliability varies greatly.
</P>
<P>
   In its day-to-day operations, no judge presides over grand jury
proceedings. Grand jury witnesses do not have counsel present. The
double jeopardy clause does not prevent a grand jury from returning
an indictment after a first grand jury has declined to do so. The
exclusionary rule does not apply to grand jury proceedings. Grand
jury witnesses have no right to respond with information, however
related, if it is not called for by the prosecution, and targets
and subjects of its inquiry have no compulsory process to gather
and present their side of the matter. Nor does the target of a
grand jury inquiry have any right to offset potentially
incriminating information with exculpatory information in his
possession. In short, the most basic techniques our adversary
system of justice employs for testing and assuring the reliability
of evidence are completely missing in the grand jury context.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, reliability simply is not the touchstone of a
grand jury inquiry. The Supreme Court itself has said that ``the
mere fact that evidence is unreliable is not sufficient to require
a dismissal of [an) indictment.'' The same is true of inadequate or
incompetent evidence. Its presence will not justify dismissal of an
indictment.
</P>
<P>
   It must therefore be recognized that it is not the grand jury's
function to provide information about anything that can be taken as
true on its face. Its function is not to get at the ultimate truth.
The grand jury's inquisitorial powers serve but one end: to empower
a body of citizens to make a threshold decision whether to initiate
the search for truth that is the purpose of adversarial proceedings
or to decline to indict and thereby forego that search altogether.
Only after the grand jury renders that threshold decision does the
search for truth really commence because only then are the
adversary system's credibility-assessing mechanisms available.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury secrecy rule &UR; , Rule 6(e), Fed. R. Crim. P., &LR;  is
justified _ indeed, mandated _ by this reality. Grand jury
information is to be kept secret largely because it has been
generated without the protections of the adversarial system. Unlike
information presented in a trial setting, grand jury information
presents an enormous risk that persons' reputations will be injured
or destroyed on the basis of non-credible or insubstantial
assertions. That harm may damage both witnesses and persons who are
subjects of witness testimony. That is why, when a grand jury
elects to indict, grand jury materials are sealed and withheld from
the petit jury ultimately convened to find the truth and render a
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly a fair report from the OIC would provide all
exculpatory evidence, assess the credibility of witnesses in terms
of bias, reason to falsify, prior inconsistent statements, etc.,
and draw reasonable inferences. A fair report would identify
shortcomings in the investigation itself, including any excesses,
mistakes, errors in judgment, or impermissible tactics. A fair
report would demonstrate that every possible effort had been made
to identify all possibly exculpatory evidence, and that all such
evidence had been given appropriate weight.
</P>
<P>
   1. The president's decision to litigate privilege issues cannot
be compared to the abuses of power alleged during Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel apparently attempts to evoke images of
Watergate by charging that the president has abused the powers of
his office. This allegation is simply meritless. In the Federalist
Papers, Alexander Hamilton described abuse of power as the
``corrupt use of the office for personal gain or some other
improper purpose.'' Former President Nixon's use of the Central
Intelligence Agency (C.I.A.) to thwart a major criminal
investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) of a
crime in which he was involved, to take but one example, fits
squarely within that definition. President Clinton's lawful
assertion of privileges in a court of law and the counsel's office
conduct of its official duties plainly does not.
</P>
<P>
   There is no comparison between the claimed abuses of power by
President Nixon and the public and lawful assertion of privileges
during the OIC investigation. Indeed, comparing this White House
with President Nixon's diminishes the historical significance of
the unprecedented claims of abuse of power by the Nixon
Administration and attempts to criminalize the proper exercise of
presidential prerogatives. The specious nature of the OIC's
allegations reveal the OIC's true motive: to create an offense
where none exists.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1974, the House Judiciary Committee lodged serious and
significant abuse of power charges against President Nixon,
alleging that President Nixon, among other things:

</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the OIC apparently has made such charges of abuse
against President Clinton, however erroneously, for purportedly
encouraging the Secret Service to assert privilege claims over
their testimony and invoking attorney-client and executive
privileges. President Clinton's privilege claims have been open and
lawful, and were reviewed and in significant measure validated by
the courts. Thus, the Nixon investigation and precedent stand in
sharp contrast to the OIC's investigation and baseless charges in
this matter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Lewinsky Expansion of the Whitewater Investigation &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of the independent counsel's jurisdiction to
encompass the Jones case and Ms. Lewinsky did not occur by accident
or easily. The OIC deliberately and purposefully sought this
expansion on an emergency basis. Media accounts that the Attorney
General herself requested this expansion are highly misleading.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 16, 1998, upon the OIC's request, the Special Division
of the Court of Appeals for the Purpose of Appointing Independent
Counsels expanded the OIC's jurisdiction to allow it to investigate
``whether Monica Lewinsky or others suborned perjury, obstructed
justice, intimidated witnesses or otherwise violated Federal law
... in dealing with witnesses, potential witnesses, attorneys or
others concerning the civil case Jones versus Clinton.'' The series
of events that led to this expansion of authority raise serious
questions as to the motivations and manipulations of the OIC in
securing this expanded jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Under the independent-counsel statute, if the ``independent
counsel discovers or receives information about possible violations
of criminal law by [covered persons), which are not covered by the
prosecutorial jurisdiction of the independent counsel, the
independent counsel may submit such information to the Attorney
General.'' The Attorney General is then to conduct a preliminary
investigation. The statute did not give the OIC authority to
conduct its own preliminary investigation in order to gather or
create evidence to present to the Attorney General to support a
request for an expansion of jurisdiction. According to media
reports, Ms. Linda Tripp contacted the OIC on Monday, Jan. 12,
1998. There was no particular logic to this contact, and she could
easily have taken her concerns to state or Federal authorities. In
any event, the OIC arranged for Ms. Tripp to wear an FBI recording
device and tape surreptitiously a conversation that she had with
Ms. Lewinsky the next day, Tuesday, Jan. 13, 1998 (Ms. Lewinsky had
not yet filed an affidavit in the Jones case). On Friday, Jan. 16,
1998, at the OIC's request, Ms. Tripp lured Ms. Lewinsky to a
meeting, where she was apprehended by OIC agents, who confronted
her and attempted to pressure her into doing surreptitious taping
herself. She was informed that an immunity agreement was contingent
on her not contacting her lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   That same day, the special division agreed to expand the OIC's
authority, based upon the independent counsel's earlier application
to the Attorney General and on the tapes that the OIC had already
created: ``In a taped conversation with a cooperating witness, Ms.
Lewinsky states that she intends to lie when deposed. In the same
conversation, she urges the cooperating witness to lie in her own
upcoming deposition. ... Independent counsel Starr has requested
that this matter be referred to him.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel later suggested that the expansion of
authority prior to the taping was unnecessary, as it was already
within his jurisdiction. However, the Lewinsky matter had no
connection whatsoever to the Whitewater activities, or any other
activities, then being investigated by the OIC In addition, the
Attorney General specifically stated in her referral to the special
division that she was seeking an expansion of the independent
counsel's jurisdiction. Or, as former independent counsel Michael
Zeldin pointed out, ``If he had jurisdiction to investigate it when
he wired her, why did he have to go to court to get it afterward?
In some ways, he is talking out of both sides of his mouth. ... It
seems to me arguable that he obtained evidence unlawfully. ...''
And former independent counsel Lawrence Walsh declared, ``A
prosecutor has no business getting into that case [Paula Jones)
unless there's something terrible happening. I question Starr's
judgment in going into it so hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the sequence of events suggests that Independent
Counsel Starr deliberately delayed requesting the expansion of
jurisdiction. Neither Monica Lewinsky nor President Clinton had
made any statements under oath in the Jones case (at least that had
been filed with any court) when Linda Tripp approached the OIC on
Jan. 12. The only evidence the OIC possessed at that time were
tapes illegally created by Tripp. The OIC itself proceeded to tape
the Tuesday, Jan. 13 conversation between Tripp and Lewinsky. Ms.
Lewinsky's affidavit was not filed in the Jones case until Jan. 16,
and the OIC had petitioned the Attorney General the day before for
an expansion of authority based on the evidence (the Tripp tapes
and the OIC's tape) that he had acquired without any authority to
do so.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tripp remained through the day at the hotel where Ms.
Lewinsky was apprehended by the OIC on Friday, Jan. 16, 1998.
During that day, Ms. Jones' lawyers repeatedly tried to contact Ms.
Tripp for a meeting, but she was unavailable. Late in the
afternoon, when it became clear that Ms. Lewinsky would not
cooperate in the surreptitious taping of others, the Jones lawyers
received a call arranging a meeting with Ms. Tripp for that night,
so she could help them prepare for the president's deposition next
day. It seems probable that Ms. Tripp, who was acting as the OIC's
agent under an immunity agreement, must have gotten approval for
this briefing from the OIC Ms. Tripp met with the Jones lawyers at
her home in Maryland that night and briefed them on the illegal
tapes she had made of Ms. Lewinsky, so they could use the contents
of those tapes in their questioning of the president. Ms. Tripp is
under investigation in the state of Maryland because she secretly
recorded Ms. Lewinsky and then shared the existence and contents of
those tapes with the Jones lawyers. It is a crime in that state,
punishable by imprisonment up to five years and a fine of up to
$10,000, for a person to ``willfully'' record a conversation
without the consent of both parties or to ``willfully'' disclose
the contents of such an illegally recorded conversation.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 17, armed with the information obtained from Ms. Tripp,
Ms. Jones's attorneys deposed President Clinton in great detail
regarding Ms. Lewinsky. At about this time, the OIC sought to
prevent press coverage of its attempt to have Ms. Lewinsky
cooperate in secret taping.
</P>
<P>
   This entire sequence of events _ the OIC's delay in requesting
jurisdiction, the OIC's pressure on reporters to withhold public
disclosure of the matter, the OIC's unwillingness to permit Ms.
Lewinsky to contact her lawyer, and the OIC's dispatch of Ms. Tripp
to brief the Jones lawyers about the fruits of her illegal taping
the day before they were to depose the president _ suggests an
intention by the OIC to insure that the expansion of jurisdiction
was kept a secret until the president and Ms. Lewinsky had given
testimony under oath and (if Ms. Lewinsky could be so persuaded)
she had been enlisted to do surreptitious taping. In other words,
rather than taking steps to defer or avoid any possible
interference with the Jones case, the OIC did everything in its
power _ and some things outside its authority _ to set up a case
against the president.

STARR REPORT IS X-RATED EXPLORATION OF CLINTON-LEWINSKY AFFAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Some readers may be offended by portions of this story)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN and MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The independent counsel's report on President
Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, released Friday by the House of
Representatives, lays bare in grisly, X-rated detail the sexual
relationship between Clinton and his one-time aide.
</P>
<P>
   The erotic detail, according to independent counsel Kenneth
Starr, was required to support Starr's conclusion that Clinton lied
when he denied under oath that he and Lewinsky had a sexual
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Lying under oath was among the 11 acts that ``may constitute
grounds for an impeachment,'' Starr said. Those counts include
allegations of lying under oath, attempting to influence witnesses,
obstructing justice and failing ``to faithfully execute the laws''
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The report's lurid details of 10 separate sexual encounters
between Clinton and Lewinsky were certain to evoke widely different
reactions from voters, with some recoiling in excruciating
embarrassment while others gobble it up like a titillating sex
novel. There was one certainty: Never in U.S. history has a
president suffered such a humiliating public examination of his sex
life.
</P>
<P>
   The president sought to take the edge off the disclosures by
telling a prayer breakfast earlier Friday that he was asking for
repentance because he had sinned. He apologized to Lewinsky and to
his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sorry,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   The White House issued a rebuttal confirming that Clinton had an
``improper relationship'' with Lewinsky but, in a remarkable
phrase, suggested there may have been nothing wrong with Clinton's
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears (Starr) has dangerously overreached to describe in
the most dramatic of terms conduct that not only is not criminal
but is actually proper and lawful,'' the White House rebuttal
asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
reacting to the Starr report, said: ``There's a lot of emotion in
this. I still think the president of the United States of America
constitutionally deserves the process to be fair. (We should)
follow the House and see what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the Starr was report was Clinton's strategic
error of making a legalistic denial in his Jan. 17 deposition in
the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit that he had sexual relations
with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   That denial provided the opening for Starr to examine in
nitty-gritty detail exactly what constituted their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The Starr report almost apologized for its erotic tone, saying
the exploration of sexually explicit details ``was unfortunate, but
... essential.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Clinton's defense was based on a ``close parsing''
of the definition of sexual relations used in the Jones deposition,
the Starr report said there was no way to show the ``falsity'' of
Clinton's denial ``other than to describe his conduct with
precision ... The detail is critical.''
</P>
<P>
   Those details provided the heft of Starr's 445-page report that
the House is studying to determine whether to proceed with an
impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Starr report noted that the FBI lab tested
semen stains on one of her dresses and concluded that Clinton was
the source of the semen. The genetic markers on the semen, which
matched the president, are characteristic of one out of 7.87
trillion caucasians.
</P>
<P>
   In the Jones case, Clinton was asked whether he had a sexual
relationship with Lewinsky based on a court-approved definition:
``For the purposes of this deposition, a person engages in `sexual
relations' when the person knowingly engages in or causes contact
with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks
of any person with an intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire
of any person.''
</P>
<P>
   Using that definition, Clinton denied under oath that he had a
sexual relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, Clinton's private lawyer, said Friday that
Starr's report recounts conduct that is ``personal and not
impeachable.'' He insisted the president's ``testified truthfully''
in the Jones deposition and before the grand jury when he denied
having sex with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer also took a swipe at the Starr report's detailing of
sex acts in the White House. ``The amount of lurid, graphic detail
here far exceeds any legitimate justification,'' Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Clinton encouraged Lewinsky to conceal the truth
about their relationship, Kendall said the president never told
Lewinsky to give false testimony.
</P>
<P>
   However, he added, ``the fact is that in all such wrongful,
improper relations, there is concomitant concealment by its very
nature. That's all that is involved here.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall and White House Counsel Charles F.C. Ruff issued a
written rubttal to the Starr report that said the Clinton's conduct
in the aftermath of the affair was nothing more than ``evidence of
a man's effort to keep an inappropriate relationship private.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebuttal characterized the relationship as a once-in-awhile
affair that ended early in 1997 ``at the president's behest.''
Clinton ended his sexual encounters with Lewinsky not because of
imminent discovery or the Jones case, but because Clinton ``knew
they were wrong,'' the rebuttal said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MORE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Starr report also detailed Lewinsky's deep emotional
attachment to Clinton. ``I never expected to fall in love with the
president,'' she testified. ``I was surprised that I did.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, Lewinsky said, she believed that he loved her too. She
said they were affectionate, with ``a lot of hugging, holding hands
sometimes. He always used to push the hair out of my face.''
</P>
<P>
   She called him ``handsome'' and on occasion he called her
``Sweetie,'' ``Baby'' or ``Dear.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton once confided to her that ``he was uncertain whether he
would remain married after he left the White House,'' leading
Lewinsky to think that ``maybe she will be his wife,'' according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky said Clinton told her that he enjoyed talking to her
and that she made him fell young.
</P>
<P>
   The White House rebuttal statement said Clinton ended his sexual
encounters in early 1997 because he ``knew they were wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr attacked Clinton's denial of a sexual relationship with
Lewinsky as a ``semantic defense ... According to the president, a
man could regularly engage in oral sex and fondling of breasts and
genitals with a woman and yet not have a `sexual affair' with
her.''
</P>
<P>
   In his grand jury testimony, Clinton said Lewinsky touched him
but he did not touch her. Starr concluded that Clinton's denial was
a lie and was one of the 11 grounds for possible impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky told a different story to the grand jury. She
indignantly said Clinton's denial of intimate touching made it seem
as if she were fulfilling a ``service contract _ that all I did was
perform oral sex on him and that that's all this relationship
was.''
</P>
<P>
   The Starr report also said that Clinton lied under oath about
not being able to recall instances when he and Lewinsky were alone,
and about the number of gifts he had given her.
</P>
<P>
   The report notes the copious amounts of gifts the two exchanged.
Lewinsky gave him neckties, an antique paperweight, sunglasses and
seven books, including ``Vox,'' a novel about phone sex. Clinton
gave Lewinsky a copy of Walt Whitman's ``Leaves of Grass,'' a hat
pin, a Rockettes blanket, and a marble-like bear's head.
</P>
<P>
   The other grounds that Starr asserted were grounds for
impeachment include alleged instances of Clinton lying about his
relationship with Lewinsky; obstructing justice by attempting to
conceal gifts he gave her; arranging a cover story through which
both would deny a relationship, helping her find a job in New York,
refusing to give grand jury testimony for seven months, and lying
to White House aides.
</P>
<P>
   Also among the 11 impeachment grounds are allegations that
Clinton ``improperly tampered'' with his personal secretary, Bettie
Currie, after his January deposition in the Jones case. In
addition, the report says Clinton ``abused his constitutional
authority'' through his lying and evasiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The report says Lewinsky confided details of the relationship to
eight friends and relatives, as well as two therapists. Among them
was Lewinsky's former co-worker and friend at the Pentagon, Linda
Tripp, who ignited the controversy by taping conversations about
the affair and turning them over to Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Others include Lewinsky's aunt, Debra Finerman; two high school
friends, Neysa Erbland and Natalie Rose Ungvari; and a former White
House co-worker, Ashley Raines.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Irene Kassorla, who counseled Lewinsky from 1992 through
1997, told prosecutors that Lewinsky reported performing oral sex
on Clinton, and that the president's touching had caused her to
have orgasms. Clinton ``became Lewinsky's life,'' she told
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Estep, a social worker, also saw Lewinsky three times
and heard similar details. Lewinsky gave Starr's team permission to
interview the two therapists.
</P>
<P>
   According to Starr's report, the sexual relationship between
Clinton and Lewinsky began on Nov. 15, 1995, four months after she
began working as an intern in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The White House staff was working late that night, dealing with
the government shutdown that had begun the day before. According to
Lewinsky, as she passed the office of former White House senior
adviser George Stephanopoulos, she saw Clinton standing alone in
the office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called her in and asked if she wanted to see his private
office. In her testimony to the independent counsel, Lewinsky said
that after walking into the president's private study, the two
talked briefly, admitting that they ``were both attracted to each
other and then he asked me if he could kiss me.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, in the windowless hallway adjacent to the study,
they kissed, according to Lewinsky's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky went back to her desk after the kiss, but returned to
the president's study at around 10 p.m., the report said. Lewinsky
and Clinton again kissed. A short time later, she recalled, the
president received a phone call from a person who Lewinsky
understood to be a member of Congress. During the phone call,
Lewinsky performed oral sex on the president, she testified.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky also said, however, that the president stopped her
before he ejaculated, telling her ``that they needed to wait until
he trusted me more.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Lewinsky's testimony, another sexual encounter took
place two days later in the Oval Office, in which she performed
oral sex on the president, again not to the point of ejaculation.
As with the alleged previous encounter, Lewinsky said the president
took a call from a member of Congress while she was performing oral
sex on him.
</P>
<P>
   According to phone records, the only member of Congress who
called the president during the time that Lewinsky was at the White
House was Rep. H.L. ``Sonny'' Callahan, R-Ala.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MORE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Callahan responded to the report on Friday by issuing a
statement: ``I can say unequivocally and without hesitation that I
had no knowledge I was sharing the President's time or attention
with anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Lewinsky's testimony, she and Clinton had eight
more sexual encounters, six while she was working at the White
House and two thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 10 sexual encounters, Lewinsky testified that she
performed oral sex on the president on nine occasions, with the
final two encounters resulting in the president's ejaculation. In
each of the nine incidents, Clinton ``fondled her and kissed her
bare breasts.'' She also said that he touched her genitals, both
through her underwear and directly, bringing her to orgasm on two
separate occasions. In one bizarre encounter on March 31, 1996,
Clinton and Lewinsky used a cigar as a sexual prop, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the one incident that did not involve oral sex, Lewinsky and
Clinton had brief genital-to-genital contact.
</P>
<P>
   The last of the encounters occurred on March 29, 1997, according
to Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The report said Lewinsky said Clinton never performed oral sex
on her. That distinction was crucial to the president's denial that
he engaged in a ``sexual affair'' with the former White House
intern because of Clinton's reading of the Jan. 17 definition in
the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clinton in his Aug. 17 testimony to the grand jury
acknowledged ``inappropriate intimate contact'' with Lewinsky but
maintained that his January denied was correct because, in his
view, that none of his sexual encounters with Lewinsky constituted
``sexual relations'' within the specific definition used in Jones
deposition.
</P>
<P>
   The Starr report said, ``The President maintained that there can
be no sexual relationship without sexual intercourse, regardless of
what other sexual activities may transpire.''
</P>
<P>
   According to report, Clinton said ``most ordinary Americans''
would embrace this distinction. The report said the president
believed so long as he did not perform any sexual acts on Lewinsky,
he had not had a sexual relationship with her.
</P>
<P>
   The report added, ``In the President's view, `any person,
reasonable person' would recognize that oral sex performed on the
deponent (in this case Clinton) falls outside the definition.''
</P>
<P>
   The president contended, the report said, that, in essence,
Lewinsky had had sexual relations with Clinton, but Clinton had not
had sexual relations with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of a cover-up was explored extensively by Starr's
report.
</P>
<P>
   After Lewinsky received a subpoena to testify in the Jones case
last December, she met with Clinton's trusted confidant Vernon
Jordan and told him of her concern about the president's gifts to
her.
</P>
<P>
   Several days later, she met Clinton and suggested to the
president that maybe she should get rid of the gifts, perhaps
giving them to Betty Currie. Clinton, according to Lewinsky,
responded: ``I don't know'' or ``let me think about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, however, told the grand jury that he counseled Lewinsky
to turn the gifts over.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, Lewinsky said, Currie called her and said: ``I
understand you have something to give me.'' But Currie testified
that it was Lewinsky who had called her and suggested disposal of
the gifts. Both agree that later still, Currie drove to Lewinsky's
Washington apartment and retrieved the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   When Jordan's testimony about his discussions with Clinton were
contradicted by Clinton, Starr decided that Jordan was more
truthful.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Starr concluded that Clinton lied when he said he
could not recall talking to Jordan about the Lewinsky subpoena in
the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton testified he recalled talking to Jordan only about
Jordan's assistance to Lewinsky in helping her find a job in New
York. However, Jordan said he kept Clinton fully informed about the
job search and the subpoena, and that he volunteered to help find
Lewinsky a lawyer after she received it.
</P>
<P>
   In finding Jordan to be the more credible witness, Starr said
Clinton was motivated to lie about discussing Lewinsky's legal
situation with Jordan because the president didn't want it to
appear he was buying Lewinsky's silence by having his powerful
friend Jordan help her find a job, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the report, Starr and his staff attempted to bolster
the credibility of Lewinsky's testimony, cross-checking and
corroborating what she said with e-mails, tape recordings and notes
made either by Lewinsky or her confidants.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, Lewinsky confided _ often times in
great detail _ in 11 people about her relationship with Clinton _
all of whom were questioned by Starr's staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in whom Ms. Lewinsky confided in detail believed she
was telling the truth about her relationship with the president,''
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   It added that her ``testimony was consistent with her statements
to confidants going back to 1995.'' The report also stated that her
accounts generally matched the testimony of White House staff
members, Secret Service agents and White House records of her
visits and of the president's telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the evaluation of experienced prosecutors and
investigators, Ms. Lewinsky has provided truthful information,''
the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For months, the American people have been mere
bystanders as the story of Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky
unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the release of Kenneth Starr's report, they have
assumed a central and conceivably decisive role in the case. The
report is in the hands of Congress, to dispose of as Congress sees
fit. A political process has begun, and in political processes, as
the Founding Fathers foresaw, the people have the ultimate power.
</P>
<P>
   It is by no means clear how they will use it, or what the result
will be. One prominent Democratic political consultant told his
clients this week that he expected Clinton to be out of the White
House within weeks. No president in the last 50 years, it is true,
has been in trouble this deep, and that one, Richard Nixon, was of
course forced from office.
</P>
<P>
   But many clear-eyed people still think that Clinton will hold
on.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, Washington is lost. There is no precedent for the
present bizarre spectacle _ lurid tales of sexual hijinks in and
near the Oval Office, poker-faced lawyers in serious suits debating
the constitutional implications thereof, and rowdy legislators
trying to behave themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a movie, or a pulp novel, or an adolescent dream about
life in the capital? No, it is real life. Or the closest
approximation that the Clinton years _ the Harding era restaged for
television _ can produce.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Whitewater investigation began, and continuing
through the revelations about Ms. Lewinsky, the voters have been
telling pollsters that they approve of Clinton's performance as
president, however they feel about his behavior or character. Three
new polls, conducted over the last two weeks by CBS News, Gallup
and the Pew Research Center, found no significant change in that
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   The polls were taken before the report was released, of course,
and it is possible that Starr's enumeration of 11 possible grounds
for impeachment may change many people's minds. The explicit
details of the president's repeated sexual encounters with Ms.
Lewinsky _ and especially the fact that some took place in the
sanctum sanctorum of American government, near the Oval Office,
several while he was on the phone with a member of Congress _ may
have an adverse impact as well.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how ephemeral and imperfect the polls may be, they
suggest that if an election were held tomorrow, and Clinton were
legally eligible to run, he would stand a reasonable chance of
winning another term.
</P>
<P>
   Which raises a very leading question: Why would the politicians
who sit in the Senate and the House of Representatives want to vote
to remove from office a president, twice elected by the people of
the United States, whose official conduct has met with such
consistent approval from the voters?
</P>
<P>
   They might do so if they felt the political winds shifting
enough that doing otherwise could put their own careers in peril.
While it is true that legislators can and often do rise above petty
partisanship on great questions of state like war or peace and
impeachment, and they may do so at this time, it is also true that
they are as subject to the instinct of self-preservation as any
other human beings.
</P>
<P>
   And there are signs that many Democrats' sensitive noses are
already picking up the scent of such climatic change. Many senators
and representatives who face close races are publicly denouncing
the president, and others have made it clear they would be just as
happy if he did not campaign for them.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important, Democrats who are considered custodians of
the traditions and values of the Senate _ elders like Daniel
Patrick Moynihan of New York and Robert Byrd of West Virginia _
have been among the most outspoken.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, the independent analyst Charles E. Cook Jr.,
who probably follows congressional politics more closely than
anyone, said that this fall's election was most likely to produce
only modest changes, if any, in the makeup of the two houses. In a
new survey distributed Friday, he said the ``mid-range scenario''
would show Democratic losses of six to 10 seats in the House and
two to four in the Senate, with much larger losses clearly
plausible.
</P>
<P>
   The legislators might also turn against the president if they
hear from the voters, either directly or indirectly, that they want
him called to account. Public backing for the president might be
quickly eroded not only by the Starr report but also the faltering
economy; one reason many voters have given over the past few years
for sticking with Clinton has been a strong stock market and full
employment.
</P>
<P>
   Phone calls, faxes and e-mails in the next days will count for a
lot.
</P>
<P>
   Every president is weak at the stage Clinton has reached, with
only two years left of his second term. The reformer's zeal is
spent, and as political attention slowly turns to the question of a
successor, the incumbent's power on Capitol Hill wanes. For
Clinton, the problem is intensified.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike President Richard Nixon, who resigned in 1974 rather than
face an impeachment trial, Clinton lacks roots in Congress. He
never served there, and he has spent little time cultivating the
Democrats upon whom his survival may well depend. Some members are
last-ditch loyalists; every single member of the Black Caucus, for
example, voted Friday to give the president a chance to study the
Starr report before it was released to the general public.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Thomas Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, who
could be a pivotal figure, is much less locked in. When he was
campaigning four years ago for his present post, he promised to put
his colleagues' interests ahead of the president's, and he
reiterated that viewpoint on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see myself as an advocate of the president per se,''
he told The Wall Street Journal. ``I see myself as ensuring that
the president gets a fair hearing. I draw a very big distinction
between the two roles.''
</P>
<P>
   The 78-page rebuttal issued by Clinton's lawyers construed the
constitutional language about impeachment as narrowly as possible.
That will clearly form one element of his defense. But there is
precedent for a broader interpretation as well. During his days in
the House, Former President Gerald Ford said that an impeachable
offense is ``whatever a majority of the House of Representatives
considers it to be at a given moment of history.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there is a close parallel, no doubt intentional,
between one of the offenses of which the House Judiciary Committee
found Nixon guilty _ failure to ``take care that the laws be
faithfully executed'' _ and one of Starr's charges _ conduct
``inconsistent with the president's constitutional duty to
faithfully execute the laws'' of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The other main element of the president's defense is contrition.
Almost every public statement in recent days has included a plea
for forgiveness. But he has lied and dissembled so often in the
past, one of his friends in the Senate said, ``that you have to ask
yourself which Clinton to believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, as The Economist said this week, ``First apologies are
what counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, it should be emphasized, need not maintain the support
of a majority of the House and Senate to survive. In the Senate, a
two-thirds majority is required to convict, so he would need only
the backing of 34 senators to hang on. In the House, a simple
majority would technically suffice to force a Senate trial, but a
225-210 vote or anything like it seems an insubstantial, unlikely
foundation on which to build a presidential trial.
</P>
<P>
   Developments now unforeseen could, of course, make things worse
for the president _ additional revelations about his conduct or
indictments of close aides in the Lewinsky matter, for example. A
more heavily Republican Senate could easily be in place for any
final vote on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Future developments could save him, too _ a foreign-policy
crisis, perhaps, or a major terrorist attack at home. His lawyers
refused Friday to rule out the possibility of a deal with Congress
that would lead to an early censure and head off any more
protracted proceeding. Otherwise, the process that began Friday
could last for months, and that is a very long time indeed in
politics.
</P>
<P>
   As he weighs his options, again and again, Clinton will have to
ask himself: Survive on what terms, and to what end? He will still
have Air Force One and the Marine Band, still meet with
congressional and foreign leaders, still have his political allies,
unless he is impeached or resigns. But his moral leadership, that
intangible legitimacy that makes a president a force in the
country, has been shattered, and reconstituting it, after all that
has happened, will be even harder than getting 34 votes in the
Senate.

REPORT DRAWS NO CONCLUSIONS ABOUT VERNON JORDAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vernon Jordan, a top Washington lawyer and longtime
confidant of President Clinton, apparently directed Monica Lewinsky
to destroy evidence of her relationship with Clinton, according to
the Starr report made public Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jordan testified under oath that both Clinton and Ms.
Lewinsky lied to him and told him they were not sexually involved,
Jordan suspected they were, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in love, that's what your problem is,'' Jordan told Ms.
Lewinsky last December, after she had complained to him that she
got angry at the president ``when he doesn't call me enough or see
me enough.'' Jordan advised the former White House intern to take
her frustrations out on him rather than on Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   And several days later, Ms. Lewinsky is quoted as saying to the
investigators, after she had been subpoenaed in the Paula Jones
case, he advised Ms. Lewinsky to throw out copies of notes that she
had written to the president. She was afraid that her erstwhile
friend, Linda Tripp, had seen them.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to Ms. Lewinsky, Jordan said: `Go home and make sure
they're not there,''' the report said. ``Ms. Lewinsky testified
that she understood that Jordan was advising her to `throw ...
away' any copies or drafts of notes that she had sent to the
President,'' the report said. It said Ms. Lewinsky then went home
and threw out copies of approximately 50 notes she had written to
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his investigation over the last several months,
Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, has been trying to
determine if Jordan had asked Ms. Lewinsky to lie under oath about
her relationship with the president. He has emphatically denied
that he asked her to do so. Neither he nor his lawyer, William
Hundley, were available Friday for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's voluminous report, which is laced with references to
Jordan, draws no conclusion about Jordan's conduct. But it paints a
portrait of Jordan as swept up in the Lewinsky melodrama in part
because Ms. Lewinsky assumed with ``a wink and a nod'' that Jordan
was fully aware of her sexual relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, a fixture in the Washington legal and social
establishment and a presidential golfing buddy who has boasted that
his bond with Clinton allows for ``a little locker-room talk,''
testified that Clinton lied to him directly about his relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan told investigators that after Ms. Lewinsky received a
subpoena last fall in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case and
appeared in Jordan's office in a highly emotional state, he
subsequently met with the president and asked him point blank
whether he had ever had sexual relations with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, never,'' the president told him, according to Jordan's
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 22 in a public statement, Jordan told reporters
``absolutely and unequivocally'' that Ms. Lewinsky had denied to
him that she was involved with the president.
</P>
<P>
   But the report indicates that Jordan suspected that the
relationship might be sexual because Ms. Lewinsky was so openly
upset in his office and because of clues from Ms. Lewinsky. For
example, she asked Jordan if Clinton was likely to stay married to
Hillary Rodham Clinton. He told prosecutors that Ms. Lewinsky
seemed ``mesmerized'' by the president. And when Ms. Lewinsky left
his office, she asked Jordan to ``give the president a hug'' for
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't have to be Einstein'' to figure out they were
probably involved, Jordan told investigators.
</P>
<P>
   While the report indicates that both the president and Ms.
Lewinsky lied to Jordan, it also says he actively tried to find her
a job only after she had been subpoenaed _ suggesting that Jordan
wanted to protect the president and buy Ms. Lewinsky's silence.

MEXICAN DRUG LORD FOUND SLAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (lb) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Rafael Munoz Talavera, who fought for control of a
major drug cartel after he was freed from charges of being the
master smuggler behind the largest cocaine seizure in history, was
found slain on Thursday, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities in Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El
Paso, Texas, discovered the body of Munoz, 45, in a parked Jeep
Cherokee at dawn on Thursday. He was tied and had several gunshot
wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz's father identified the body on Thursday evening, but the
authorities said they would investigate further to be sure of its
identity.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have accused Munoz of leading a violent campaign
to take control of the Juarez drug cartel after the death of its
leader, Amado Carrillo Fuentes, during plastic surgery in July
1997. But in an open letter to President Ernesto Zedillo that Munoz
paid to have published in several Mexican newspapers in December,
he denied those accusations, calling himself ``a simple,
hard-working man.''
</P>
<P>
   Munoz's death could provoke new revenge killings in Juarez,
which has seen scores of drug killings in the last year, one
law-enforcement official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But other people familiar with the drug underworld there said
Munoz's death _ which they said confirmed their sense that he had
lost his battle for the cartel months ago _ might usher in a calmer
period in which his rivals control the billion-dollar narcotics
commerce that passes through Juarez into El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   ``He who lives by the sword truly dies by it,'' Glenn McTaggert,
an assistant U.S. attorney who worked for seven years collecting
evidence against Munoz, said Friday in a telephone interview.
``They've certainly terminated a kingpin. This changes the whole
complexion of the drug landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the fall of 1989, Munoz was known in Juarez as a sober
restaurateur from a leading local family. Agents of the Drug
Enforcement Agency in El Paso were suspicious of a $3 million
estate he had built in El Paso, but he was not known as a major
trafficker.
</P>
<P>
   But in September of that year, the authorities seized 21 tons of
cocaine in a warehouse in the Los Angeles suburb of Sylmar, and
several traffickers arrested in connection with that seizure
identified Munoz as their leader.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of cocaine seized at Sylmar was more than has ever
been found in one place before or since. And ledgers showed that
much more cocaine _ hundreds of tons, worth billions of dollars _
had passed through the warehouse in the preceding months.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of U.S. pressure for Munoz's arrest, the Mexican
authorities arrested him and put him on trial in Mexico, using
evidence collected by U.S. officials in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A Mexican judge acquitted Munoz after a trial in Juarez in 1991.
The next year he was rearrested in connection with the same charges
in Hermosillo, and a judge there convicted him in 1995. But an
appellate panel freed him in 1996, noting that he had been tried
twice for the same crime.
</P>
<P>
   After his release, testimony that emerged in several U.S. trials
and in Mexican court records showed that Munoz's acquittal in his
first trial, in Juarez, had been arranged by the corrupt Mexican
police commander who had arrested him and by the deputy attorney
general who had supervised his prosecution. Both Mexican officials
were on Munoz's payroll, witnesses have testified.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Barrio Terrazas, the governor of Chihuahua, said in an
interview this year that after his release, Munoz forged an
alliance with exceptionally violent traffickers from Tijuana,
hoping to seize control of the Juarez drug trade from Carrillo's
followers.
</P>
<P>
   Months of killings followed. One grisly slaughter that Barrio
attributed to Munoz and his Tijuana henchmen came in August 1997,
when a Juarez restaurant was sprayed with gunfire, killing six.

 By DAVID HENDRICKS  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Beset by market attacks on the peso spurred by
worldwide currency fluctuations and devaluation fears, Mexico wants
the United States and other leading industrialized countries to
help stabilize and solve the Russian economic crisis, Mexican
Commerce Secretary Herminio Blanco said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A cut in U.S. interest rates also would help Mexico, Blanco
acknowledged in an interview after addressing a U.S.-Mexico
economic outlook conference coordinated by the San Antonio Hispanic
Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The Group of Seven nations, the world's top economic powers,
could stem much of the devaluation fears spreading across Latin
America by helping solve Russia's free fall, Blanco said.
</P>
<P>
   With its government in turmoil, Russia devalued the ruble,
adding to economic jitters in Asia and putting pressure on Latin
American nations, such as Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need the help of the G-7 to take charge to solve the
international situation,'' Blanco said. ``This world situation
won't go away by itself. The G-7 needs to solve the problem in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly hope Brazil can come out of its problems
successfully,'' Blanco added. ``We need a strong Brazil so that all
Latin American countries can keep a high rate of economic growth.''

   SAN ANTONIO _ Beset by market attacks on the peso spurred by
worldwide currency fluctuations and devaluation fears, Mexico wants
the United States and other leading industrialized countries to
help stabilize and solve the Russian economic crisis, Mexican
Commerce Secretary Herminio Blanco said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A cut in U.S. interest rates also would help Mexico, Blanco
acknowledged in an interview after addressing a U.S.-Mexico
economic outlook conference coordinated by the San Antonio Hispanic
Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The Group of Seven nations, the world's top economic powers,
could stem much of the devaluation fears spreading across Latin
America by helping solve Russia's free fall, Blanco said.
</P>
<P>
   With its government in turmoil, Russia devalued the ruble,
adding to economic jitters in Asia and putting pressure on Latin
American nations, such as Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need the help of the G-7 to take charge to solve the
international situation,'' Blanco said. ``This world situation
won't go away by itself. The G-7 needs to solve the problem in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly hope Brazil can come out of its problems
successfully,'' Blanco added. ``We need a strong Brazil so that all
Latin American countries can keep a high rate of economic growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the United States, the G-7 nations are Britain, Canada,
France, Germany, Italy and Japan. Despite its economic troubles,
Russia became a member in 1997, effectively making it the Group of
Eight.
</P>
<P>
   Blanco acknowledged that a U.S. interest-rate cut by the Federal

COMMENTARY: MARK IN PARADISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RUSSELL BAKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the course of being interviewed half-to-death this week, Mark
McGwire began speculating on the next world. One of these days, he
said, he hoped to meet Babe Ruth there and talk with him about
hitting home runs.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire had clearly not thought this through at the time, and no
wonder. With millions of people cheering him and millions of
dollars about to flow through his bank account, he can hardly have
been in a reflective mood about the perils of afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   One of the gravest is the likelihood that hardened old afterlife
habitues may not want to be badgered by newcomers eager to talk
shop. Look at it from Babe Ruth's point of view:
</P>
<P>
   Every day he has to put up with vile and tireless harangues from
the irascible Ty Cobb. He is sick and tired of hearing Ty say that
any muscular lout can hit home runs, but only an artist can do what
Ty Cobb could do.
</P>
<P>
   To shake the churlish Cobb, the Babe sneaks off to a bosky
retreat that's not too well lit. I have trouble visualizing
afterlife geography but I clearly see a beer keg in this retreat.
It is Paradise, after all, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   So the Babe is hunkered down in a banquette with, oh, say this
lady, not one of his wives, from the Ziegfeld chorus line. And who
comes over to talk baseball but Casey Stengel, doing his ``Old
Perfessor'' number, which is to say, talking baseball nonstop and
making no sense whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Say the Babe ditches Casey and heads for a schoolyard to chat
with a kid for whom he once hit a home run because the kid was
dying. What happens? A gang of sports writers falls upon him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who was the toughest pitcher you ever saw, Babe? And what
about that time you pointed to the stands just before you hit a
homer into that very spot? Think you could have played for
Steinbrenner, Babe?'' And so on.
</P>
<P>
   Now, imagine Mark McGwire has just checked in. A huge guy.
Doesn't recognize a soul, though. Sees another huge guy. It can't
be Babe Ruth, can it? This guy's muscularity makes McGwire's look
minuscular.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe Ruth has been working out since starting afterlife.
Given up those hot dogs and gone on a decent diet. Started going to
bed at night instead of chasing women not his wives.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not Babe Ruth, by any chance?'' McGwire asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Samson,'' says the big fellow, shaking McGwire's hand. ``I
pull down temples with bare hands. What do you do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I plaster the old horsehide,'' says McGwire. ``I take the
pitcher downtown. I leave the yard, powder the old pill, knock it
into the next county, clear the bases with one mammoth swing . .
.''
</P>
<P>
   I imagine Mark can see Samson losing interest fast. I guess he
thinks, ``Maybe Samson doesn't understand these ancient baseball
cliches.''
</P>
<P>
   I think he says, ``You know where I can find Babe Ruth?''
</P>
<P>
   I fancy the Babe is over at Salome's Bar &AMP; Grill watching a
matinee performance of the dance of the seven veils.
</P>
<P>
   I like to think that Mark McGwire doesn't hang out in such
places watching such dances. He is too obviously a man of sweet and
even temperament, humble in his triumph, patient beyond the
capacity of Job himself with the interviewers forever asking the
dumbest question in all earthly and afterlife journalism: ``How
does it feel, Mark?''
</P>
<P>
   The wise policy for Mark would probably be to wait for Babe Ruth
to come to him. If he seeks out Ruth during his first few centuries
of afterlife he will almost certainly find the Babe scornful and
insulting.
</P>
<P>
   The money, Mark. Remember the money! Don't think for a moment
that the Babe has forgotten he made only $80,000 a year for being
the Sultan of Swat. How do you think he's going to feel when he
asks what a Sultan of Swat makes these days and you tell him,
``Millions, Mr. Ruth, sir. Millions and millions''?
</P>
<P>
   I think he's going to say, ``And you only hit 65 or 70 home runs
a season? I hit 60 for a piddling $80,000. If they'd paid me 5 or 6
million I could probably have hit 150 before the Fourth of July.''
</P>
<P>
   A cautious home-run king would avoid him. Don't press yourself
on him, and one day he'll probably wave to you and say, ``Hey, kid,
let's go over to Salome's for some beer, hot dogs and seven veils
and talk about hitting.''

<P>
   It was a surreal and unnerving spectacle sadly translated from
the world of tabloid television to the world of governance: the
White House issuing a press release Friday about the nature of
President Clinton's sexual activities, a reporter asking Mike
McCurry whether the president suffered from ``satyriasis'' and the
entire globe becoming privy, via the Internet, to Clinton's
intimate, sexual proclivities _ the sort of things people do not
know about their best friends, much less the most powerful man on
the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton not only faces the prospect of impeachment (the Starr
report charges perjury, obstruction of justice and the abuse of
power) but has become the nightly butt of crude sexual jokes on
``The Tonight Show'' and ``Politically Incorrect,'' even as he and
his supporting cast _ Monica Lewinsky, Linda Tripp, et al. _ have
become cartoon figures in the popular imagination, discussed in the
same lurid, soap-opera tones as Joey Buttafuoco, Marv Albert and
the Bobbitts.
</P>
<P>
   What has brought us to this bizarre, disturbing moment? In a
sense, Clinton's own actions _ his dalliances with Monica Lewinsky,
his efforts to cover up those dalliances, and his long,
disingenuous relationship with the truth _ have acted as a match
that turned a confluence of cultural trends into a political
conflagration, all fueled further by the technological wizardry of
the Internet and the global village of TV.
</P>
<P>
   The growing tabloidization of American culture, manifested in
everything from Jerry Springer to the rise of a virulent new form
of biography focused on dysfunction and disease, has effectively
blurred the lines between public and private concerns and fed a
voyeuristic appetite for gossip.
</P>
<P>
   The institutionalization of the women's movement (championed by
Bill Clinton) has lent issues like sexual harassment a new
visibility, while the penchant of politicians like Clinton for spin
and image control has nurtured a public suspicion of appearances
and helped shift our cultural dialogue from the moral and ethical
to the narrowly legalistic.
</P>
<P>
   In many respects, as Clinton biographers have pointed out, the
president has been a mirror of his times: a postwar baby boomer,
who came of age during the social and political upheavals of the
'60s.
</P>
<P>
   In a nation giddy on the adolescent humor of ``Something About
Mary'' and ``South Park,'' we have a president described by
biographers as being emotionally needy, indecisive and
undisciplined, a politician whose career has repeatedly followed
the roller-coaster trajectory of an action-adventure thriller.
</P>
<P>
   In a day when deconstructionists, feminists and radical
Afrocentrists have declared truth a relative matter, we have a
president who has suggested that sex does not mean sex, that
smoking dope does not mean inhaling, that sidestepping the draft
does not mean trying to avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   And in an age of confessional talk shows and 12-step programs,
we have a president happy to discuss his underwear (boxers or
briefs) on television, a president who has now followed the likes
of Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart in confessing to sins and asking
to be forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   There is something oddly primal about the spectacle of the
leader of the free world tottering on the brink of disaster, as a
chorus of pundits, lawyers and spinmeisters (often in neatly
matched pairs of conservatives and liberals, presidential
adversaries and defenders) take to the airwaves to prophesy his
fate.
</P>
<P>
   One can even make analogies to Shakespeare's Richard II, another
garrulous, self-pitying ruler, brought down by his own narcissism
and personal flaws _ a ruler whose self-inflicted wounds would have
lasting effects on the world around him.
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton's case, it is a drama filled with ironies large and
small. Here is a president, obsessed with his legacy, now faced
with a legacy of shame; a man famous for saying ``I feel your
pain,'' now forced to feel his own; a cheating husband, married to
a woman who two and a half decades ago worked with the House
Judiciary Committee considering the impeachment of Richard M.
Nixon, who may now face impeachment himself.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a protean politician, who has argued that character ``is
a journey, not a destination,'' now compelled to confront the
fallout of the ``character issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Marx once observed that history repeats itself, the first time
as tragedy, the second time as farce. It is the peculiar nature of
Clinton's predicament _ and other contemporary phenomena, like the
O.J. Simpson trial _ that tragedy and farce coexist, that the
horrifying and the absurd now frequently dwell side by side.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, we have the somber pageant of a nation forced to
contemplate the possible removal of its leader, with all the
collateral damage visited upon the office of president and the
country's ability to focus on serious issues. On the other hand, we
have the salacious details of the Monica Lewinsky affair: the
``yuck factor'' of a soiled dress, DNA tests and hours of
prime-time talk about oral sex and sex addiction.
</P>
<P>
   As Richard II awaited his fate, Shakespeare had him declare:
``O! that I were as great / As is my grief, or lesser than my name,
/ Or that I could forget what I have been, / Or not remember what I
must be now.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Friday's prayer-breakfast speech was sincere or part of
what Ted Koppel has called a ``new strategy'' of remorse, Clinton
declared that he had sinned, that he had ``a broken spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   In a typically contemporary blend of legalistic defensiveness
and self-abnegating moralism, he added: ``I will instruct my
lawyers to mount a vigorous defense, using all available
appropriate arguments, but legal language must not obscure the fact
that I have done wrong.'' Some form of a mea culpa perhaps, but not
exactly words that conjure up the elevated world of classical
tragedy: Job on the ash-heap, Lear on the heath, Ahab on the
quarterdeck.

 &HT;    LURID REPORT PROMPTS A PRESIDENTIAL CONFESSION OF SIN
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's report to
Congress, packed with lurid details of White House sexual
encounters between President Clinton and former intern Monica
Lewinsky, fanned the impeachment fever gripping the nation's
capital Friday and prompted an extraordinary moist-eyed confession
of sin from a president seeking political salvation.
</P>
<P>
   The 445-page report, made public by a 363-63 House vote Friday,
lists 11 grounds for the impeachment of the president, including
lying under oath, obstructing justice, tampering with witnesses and
abusing the power of his office to try to cover up his affair with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers, in an unusual briefing for reporters at
the White House, denounced the report as an attempt to humiliate
and politically damage the president. They challenged Starr's
conclusion that the president's conduct with Lewinsky warrant his
removal from office by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``In short, this is personal and not impeachable,'' declared
David Kendall, Clinton's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Republican congressional leaders countered that Starr's report,
while explicit in its description of Clinton's sexual encounters
with Lewinsky, focuses primarily on whether the president had
fulfilled his constitutional duties. ``That's a very important
distinction,'' said Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   But never before has a sitting president's sex life been
described so publicly in such graphic detail in an official report
to Congress: stolen kisses in a darkened Oval Office, ``intense''
flirting in the hallways of the White House West Wing, 10 acts of
oral sex, ``playful'' groping along the rope line at his 50th
birthday party, phone sex, multiple orgasms and the use of a cigar
as a sexual aid.
</P>
<P>
   And never has buttoned-down official Washington been held so
rapt by such sexually explicit evidence in a case that began as an
investigation of shady land deals in Arkansas nearly two decades
ago. The report's account of Lewinsky's grand jury testimony
includes her confession of love for the president and her hope that
the two might even marry after Clinton's presidency is over and he
has divorced Hillary. ``I just knew he was in love with me,'' she
told a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Also relying on Lewinsky's testimony, the report portrays
Clinton as occasionally tortured by his sexual desires, trying
desperately to end the relationship with Lewinsky, only to allow it
to resume. ``I promised myself it wasn't going to happen again,''
he explained to the grand jury last month. But it did.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's report summarized 10 sexual encounters between the
president and Lewinsky between Nov. 15, 1995, and Dec. 28, 1997,
most of them occurring in the windowless hallway outside the
private study off the Oval Office. It reported publicly, for the
first time, that DNA tests conclusively established that Clinton
and the 25-year-old former intern had a sexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sickening, it's repulsive, it's wrong, it's a sad day for
the country,'' Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, said in reaction to the
report, echoing comments throughout Washington. But, ``whether or
not there's an impeachable offense remains to be seen,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, some Republicans were quick to condemn the
president. Charging that the president ``has destroyed the
integrity of his office,'' Rep. George Radanovich, R-Calif., became
the latest of nearly two dozen members of Congress to call upon
Clinton to resign.
</P>
<P>
   But others were puzzled to learn that Starr's report focused
solely on the president's attempt to conceal his relations with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Linder, R-Ga., a close ally of House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, said, ``I'm surprised we got a document that only deals
with Monica Lewinsky.'' Linder said the ``sexual environement''
that framed Starr's allegations ``could be significant in terms of
how the public takes it.''
</P>
<P>
   An accurate reading of that may be days away. People must digest
the lengthy report and sort out their reactions to it before public
opinion polls can begin to measure their response.
</P>
<P>
   Their final judgement is sure to shape the impeachment battle
just getting under way between the White House and Congress _ a
battle that has sobered the comments, moods and atmospheres at both
ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's report alleges five counts of Clinton lying under oath,
four counts of obstructing justice, one count of tampering with a
witness and one count of abusing his constitutional authority in
trying to conceal his relationship with Lewinsky amid legal
proceedings in a civil suit by Paula Jones accusing him of sexual
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   The report said Clinton took actions ``inconsistent with the
president's constitutional duty to faithfully execute the laws.''
It accused the president of pursuing ``a strategy of deceiving the
American people and Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   It said he lied under oath in the Jones suit by denying a sexual
relationship with Lewinsky and by denying that he had any contact
with her breasts or genitals. ``The president's denials _ semantic
and factual _ do not withstand scrutiny,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   The possible grounds for impeachment outlined by Starr focus
largely on the steps Clinton and his longtime friend, Vernon
Jordan, took to help Lewinsky find a job in New York after she was
subpoenaed as a witness in the Jones suit last December and whether
he tried to influence the testimony of his Oval Office secretary,
Betty Currie, the day after he himself testified in the Jones suit
last January.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the president did not expressly instruct her to lie,
according to Ms. Lewinsky, he did suggest misleading cover
stories'' for her visits with him, the report said. And he tried to
``corruptly influence the testimony'' of Currie, suggesting that
she back his claim of having never been alone with Lewinsky, it
added.
</P>
<P>
   At an annual White House prayer breakfast Friday, a
Scripture-quoting Clinton delivered a moist-eyed confession of sin
and expression of contrition to 106 religious leaders, asking for
God's help and promising to seek pastoral support as he follows a
``path of repentance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a genuine confession of sins,'' said the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, a frequent spiritual adviser to Clinton. ``He left no
stone unturned in reaching out. We saw today none of the legalisms
that we have seen in the past. We saw this real desire to be
better, to be freed of the burden of the alibis.''
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of the day, the president's lawyers were arguing
that Clinton's actions did not constitute impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The salacious allegations in this referral are simply intended
to humiliate, embarrass and politically damage the president,''
Kendall said. ``There a lot of lurid allegations in the
prosecutor's referral, but there is no credible evidence of
impeachable offenses.''

FOR DEATH OF ITS DIPLOMATS, IRAN VOWS BLOOD FOR BLOOD

   TEHRAN, Iran _ Iran vowed revenge Friday against the militant
Taliban movement that controls most of neighboring Afghanistan,
with the Revolutionary Guards saying that the Taliban should be
given ``what they so richly deserve'' for killing at least nine
Iranian diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement on Iranian television, the elite force added,
``The Taliban and the main agents responsible for this horrific
crime must know that they shall never be immune to the tumultuous
anger of the Islamic corps.''
</P>
<P>
   And Iran's former president, Hashemi Rafsanjani, who is still a
key official, said Friday during prayer services at Tehran
University: ``I offer condolences to the martyrs' families and
promise them that we will get revenge for their blood.'' The
gathering was punctuated by chants of ``Death to the Taliban.''
</P>
<P>
   The fierce new round of threats followed an admission by the
Taliban leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar, on Thursday that Taliban
soldiers had ``either intentionally or unintentionally'' killed the
diplomats last month during the capture of the northern Afghan town
of Mazar-i-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's state news agency, IRNA, said Friday that its
correspondent in Mazar-i-Sharif, who disappeared along with the 11
diplomats, had also been killed by the Taliban, Agence
France-Presse reported Friday. That report could not be
independently confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Some Iranian officials took pains Friday to emphasize that Iran
would not be drawn into hasty action. But the public declarations
compounded an atmosphere of heavy tension already overlaid by an
Iranian troop buildup along the Afghan border.
</P>
<P>
   For the last month, the disappearance of the diplomats assigned
to the Iranian consulate in Mazar-i-Sharif has been Iran's main
concern, but Iranian officials have displayed increasing alarm at
the prospect of a permanent presence by the Taliban, purist
followers of Islam's dominant Sunni faith, on the eastern borders
of Iran, a Shiite Muslim state.
</P>
<P>
   Friday in New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged all
parties concerned ``to exercise maximum restraint and refrain from
any action which might be construed by others as provocative.''

   TEHRAN, Iran _ Iran vowed revenge Friday against the militant
Taliban movement that controls most of neighboring Afghanistan,
with the Revolutionary Guards saying that the Taliban should be
given ``what they so richly deserve'' for killing at least nine
Iranian diplomats.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The gathering was punctuated by chants of ``Death to the
Taliban!''
</P>
<P>
   The fierce new round of threats followed an admission by the
Taliban leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar, on Thursday that Taliban
soldiers had ``either intentionally or unintentionally'' killed the
diplomats last month during the capture of the northern Afghan town
of Mazar-i-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's state news agency, IRNA, said Friday that its
correspondent in Mazar-i-Sharif, who disappeared along with the 11
diplomats, had also been killed by the Taliban, Agence
France-Presse reported Friday. That report could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Some Iranian officials took pains Friday to emphasize that Iran
would not be drawn into hasty action. But the public declarations
compounded an atmosphere of heavy tension already overlaid by an
Iranian troop buildup along the Afghan border.
</P>
<P>
   Iran, a major backer of an opposition alliance fighting the
Taliban, has reacted with deep apprehension to Taliban victories
that have left the militant movement in control of most of
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   For the last month, the disappearance of the diplomats assigned
to the Iranian consulate in Mazar-i-Sharif has been Iran's main
concern, but Iranian officials have displayed increasing alarm at
the prospect of a permanent presence by the Taliban, purist
followers of Islam's dominant Sunni faith, on the eastern borders
of Iran, a Shiite Muslim state.
</P>
<P>
   Friday Taliban forces were reported to be beginning an assault
on another Afghan town, Bamiyan, that is home to large number of
Shiites, and foreign diplomats said they were concerned that if
more widespread killings were reported there, Iran might feel
compelled to launch some kind of military intervention.
</P>
<P>
   To many Iranians, what happened to the diplomats in
Mazar-i-Sharif is being seen as final proof that the Taliban cannot
be trusted. Rafsanjani described the Taliban Friday as part of ``a
very deep conspiracy to occupy Iran at its eastern borders.'' But
Rafsanjani also declared that Iran would not take rash action.
</P>
<P>
   His words suggested that, rather than launch any kind of all-out
attack on a country that has historically been a quagmire for
invading forces, Iran might well wait to gauge how others respond
to what it has labeled ``a shocking and horrifying atrocity.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to Iran's complaint, the United Nations Security
Council promised on Thursday night to begin ``an urgent
investigation into these crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian military force of some 70,000 troops along the
Afghan border staged a threatening round of wargames that ended on
Monday. A new round of military exercises could begin as early as
Sunday, Iranian officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   But Iranian officials, including the current president, Mohammad
Khatami, are suggesting a willingness, at least for now, to see how
the United Nations chooses to assess blame for the diplomats'
death.
</P>
<P>
   In New York Friday, Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged all
parties concerned ``to exercise maximum restraint and refrain from
any action which that might be construed by others as
provocative.''
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general's spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said that Annan
had been talking to Iran and Pakistan, a diplomatic conduit to the
Taliban, about organizing a mission to Afghanistan that would
include United Nations technical experts to look at the site where
the nine bodies were found.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban commander, Mullah Omar, who reported his findings in
a letter to the Security Council, said that the soldiers who killed
the diplomats had acted on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Other Taliban officials have said that by the time Taliban
commanders arrived at the Iranian consulate on the day of the
attack, none of the diplomats were anywhere to be found.
</P>
<P>
   But Iranian officials have presented a very different account.
In broadcasts on Iranian state television, they have claimed that
Sheik Omar himself ordered an attack on the consulate, and that it
was carried out by a Taliban commander and 15 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranians have said that officials who had been on the phone
with their counterparts in Mazar-i-Sharif had heard a hail of
gunshots as the attack began. Taliban officials have not yet said
anything about the remaining two Iranian diplomats, but Iranian
officials said Friday they believed they were still alive and may
have escaped from Taliban custody.

PRIMAKOV APPOINTED PRIME MINISTER, FATE OF ECONOMIC REFORM
QUESTIONED 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Handily winning a confirmation vote in the Russian
Parliament, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov signaled a sharp shift
toward a more socialist economic model Friday by endorsing two of
the Communist Party's hand-picked candidates for top posts,
including head of the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The appointments _ of a moderate Communist who ran the Soviet
state planning agency and a central banker associated with easy
money policies and inflation in the early 1990s _ raised questions
about the future of Russian economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   After only one day's preparation for a job he said he had not
sought, Primakov's ideas for the economy were necessarily vague.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing before parliament's lower house, the Duma, the day
after he was named as a compromise candidate by President Boris
Yeltsin, Primakov spoke of bolstering Russian industry, of moving
away from a dependency on foreign loans and of giving the
government more of a role in regulating the economy. And he invoked
President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal as an example of the
measured use of government intervention to rescue a country from
economic depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a return to the command and administrative system,
no,'' he said. ``But the state must do this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed, it did not occur to anyone to condemn the United
States for example, when Roosevelt introduced some elements of
state regulation in the economy after the Great Depression. So
should we copy the wild capitalism that existed in the past, or
should we use the experience accumulated by humankind?''
</P>
<P>
   Primakov said he would put together a government of ``unity''
whose first task will be to pull Russia out of its deepening social
and economic crisis and restore Moscow's dwindling authority over
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a magician,'' he said after winning Parliament's
approval 317-63, with 15 abstentions. ``Don't expect me to produce
any quick fixes.''
</P>
<P>
   By appointing Yuri Maslyukov, the Communists' leading candidate
for the premiership, as his top deputy, Primakov indicated that he
had already struck an alliance with Yeltsin's leftist opposition,
which has tried to capitalize on Russia's monthlong crisis to put
its people and policies in a new government.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma on Friday also approved a parallel appointment of
Viktor Gerashchenko as chairman of Russia's Central Bank, bringing
back a Soviet-era banker who in the early 1990s was the nemesis of
Yeltsin's team of young Western-style reformers. Gerashchenko's
return to the Central Bank, at Yeltsin's request, was seen by many
experts as another important sign that Russia is moving off the
path of tight monetary policies, back to an era of free spending
and easy credits disbursed to rescue failing industries.
</P>
<P>
   Gennadi Zyuganov, the Communist Party chief, on Friday all but
confirmed that the alliance between Primakov and the left had been
made earlier this week, with Yeltsin's approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the closed meeting at the president's office, five
candidates were considered,'' Zyuganov said in a speech supporting
Primakov's nomination. ``The very fact that three of them agreed to
work in the same team _ Primakov, Maslyukov and Gerashchenko _
deserves respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, ever the wily diplomat, on Friday pointedly left the
door open for other political parties to join the government, but
gave no word on the fate of acting Deputy Prime Minister Boris
Fyodorov, the only voice for Western-style reform who has remained
in power since Yeltsin began his latest government shake-up on Aug.
23.
</P>
<P>
   Fyodorov, who was named this summer as chief of Russia's tax
collection service, said on Friday that he would not resign.
``Under no circumstances will I go on my own,'' he told a Russian
news agency. ``My nerves are pretty strong.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Grigory Yavlinsky, head of a liberal opposition party who only
Thursday had hopes of playing a key role in a Primakov government,
on Friday took his distance from the new prime minister. Yavlinsky
had been the first to publicly float Primakov's name as a
compromise candidate this week, when Russia was headed toward a
constitutional confrontation over the nomination of former Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   Admitting he had ``doubts'' about the composition of the
government, Yavlinsky on Friday issued a thinly veiled warning
against the kind of loose monetary policies that stalled Russia's
economic reforms in 1993, when Gerashchenko was head of the Central
Bank. ``We must not allow ruinous printing of money, or the
blocking of import duties, or nationalization,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Konstantin Borovoi, a businessman and an independent member of
Parliament, speaking on behalf of five other independent deputies,
was even more blunt. ``The latest events go to show that this is a
collusion, that the president is in cahoots with the Communists,
trying to keep his own post by giving up democracy, the path of
reforms and the market economy,'' he said. ``This will not work.''
</P>
<P>
   This alarmist view echoed dire warnings made Thursday by
Chernomyrdin, who accused the Communists of trying to stage a
``crawling coup'' and restore the old Soviet regime and its command
economy. But Primakov on Friday insisted that his coalition Cabinet
would be made up of ``professionals'' who will be required to leave
their political agendas at the door.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief television address before Parliament's vote, Yeltsin
urged support for his new prime minister whose nomination, he said,
had pulled the country back from ``the brink of a serious political
crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have yet to draw the lessons of the present crisis,''
Yeltsin said. ``In the meantime, we must work to overcome it. We
must all work in concert.''
</P>
<P>
   As the political crisis recedes, Russia's economic crisis moves
back to the top of the agenda, and Primakov's government will face
decisions on a range of issues from the stabilization of the ruble,
to the resolution of an endemic banking crisis, to the dismantling
of Russia's mountain of internal debt.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has already defaulted on $447 million in interest
payments due to Germany last month, the first time it has missed
its deadline for repaying sovereign loans from other governments. A
Finance Ministry spokesman said Russia would fulfill its
obligations on the debt and put the blame for the delay on the
deadlock in the Russian banking system, where payments and
withdrawals have ground to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   Maslyukov, a moderate Communist who served as head of the Soviet
central planning agency and briefly as minister for Trade and
Industry in Yeltsin's last government, is expected to be put in
charge of overall economic policy. Whether Primakov will give him
free reign to dictate that policy remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   During his brief stint in government this summer, Maslyukov made
his mark by trying to enlarge his staff and widen his sphere of
influence to include Russia's military-industrial sector _ tactics
that come naturally to Soviet-trained bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   Gerashchenko's return to the Central Bank brings Russia's recent
history full circle, back to the days when he and Fyodorov, then
finance minister, clashed regularly over monetary policy. In those
days, the Central Bank was a source of cheap credits for Russian
industry, a policy that its critics said not only encouraged badly
managed factories but also spurred inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks to reporters on Friday, Gerashchenko, 60, who has
been president of International Moscow Bank, said he would react
``cautiously'' to pleas from his Communist supporters to pump a
huge infusion of new rubles into the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Given the depths of Russia's current economic plight, even
liberal economists say some printing of new money may be necessary
to help the country and its people survive the surge of inflation
that followed last month's devaluation of the ruble. Chernomyrdin,
campaigning for the post of prime minister last week, said 40
billion new rubles _ or 16 percent of Russia's current money supply
_ are needed to tide the country through the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, Fyodorov has pressed for the creation of a
currency board, which would strictly regulate the amount of rubles
in relation to Russia's reserves of gold and foreign currency. But
Gerashchenko on Friday dismissed the proposal out of hand, calling
it foolish.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts suggested Friday that Gerashchenko, with his inside
knowledge of the workings of Russia's commercial banks, might do a
better job than his predecessor at controlling wayward banks, which
had gambled heavily, and lost, on Russia's ill-fated short-term
Treasury bills and risky currency contracts with Western banks.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, officials at the International Monetary Fund said
they would judge the new Russian government based on how it
approaches its economic problems, not on the past ideologies of its
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to see what the policies of the new government will
be, and we will have to see how Mr. Maslyukov and his team decide
to operate the economy,'' Stanley Fischer, the fund's first deputy
managing director, told reporters. ``We will judge on the basis of
policy. It does not matter what the past of the policymakers is. It
matters what the policies are.''

</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday defeated an attempt to bring campaign
finance legislation up for a final vote. The 52-48 majority in
favor of voting on reform fell short of the 60 votes needed to beat
back a Republican-led filibuster. The reform bill, sponsored by
Sen. Russell D. Feingold, D-Wis., and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
would have banned the unlimited and unregulated soft money
contributions to political parties and would have restricted issue
ads. Supporters said the bill is necessary to prevent the abuses
that arose in the 1996 campaign. Opponents argued that such
restrictions are a violation of the free speech guarantee under the
Constitution. A ``yes'' vote favors bringing the issue to a vote.

HOUSE VOTE TO RELEASE STARR REPORT IS OVERWHELMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With memories of Watergate echoing through the
chamber, the House on Friday voted to make public the report of
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and to begin the process that
could lead to the first impeachment proceedings against a president
in 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   The 363-63 vote in favor of public disclosure was overwhelming,
despite impassioned protests by Democrats that President Clinton
was being denied the fundamental fairness of an advance look at the
prosecutor's charges before they were sent to the world on the
Internet. In a sign of the president's political isolation, only 63
Democrats and no Republicans opposed the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here because circumstances and our Constitution have
thrust upon us an onerous duty _ one that requires us to summon the
courage and the means to defend the rule of law,'' said Rep. Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, which now
takes the lead in determining whether to open an impeachment
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please don't forget,'' said the white-maned Hyde, ``when all
the distractions and definitions have been pronounced, at the end
of it all, we are about one mighty task _ to vindicate the rule of
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after the vote, two Capitol police officers carried two
sealed boxes containing Starr's 445-page report into a House office
building. House Sergeant-at-arms Wilson Livingood cut the seals and
removed the black looseleaf-bound report for duplication on
high-speed copying machines. He resealed appendices that had not
yet been authorized for release.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first copies went to Hyde. ``This is the beginning of
a long climb up a steep mountain,'' he said, as he signed for his
copy. Still other House members made printouts from Congress' own
internal web site.
</P>
<P>
   The ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, Rep. John
Conyers of Michigan, also received an early copy. Conyers and 28
members of the 35-person Congressional Black Caucus voted against
such a quick release of the main document.
</P>
<P>
   Under the resolution approved by the House, the 37-member
Judiciary Committee now has until Sept. 28 to review 17 other boxes
full of video and audio tapes, transcripts of testimony and other
materials sent to Congress by Starr, and then to decide what to
make public.
</P>
<P>
   The House also empowered the committee to review Starr's charges
of ``serious and credible'' offenses and decide whether to
recommend that the House initiate an impeachment inquiry. Many
members of Congress say they believe that momentum is building for
formal impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional leaders are now planning to recess instead of
adjourning this fall. That would allow a lame-duck House to return
and take a formal vote on whether to begin an impeachment inquiry
before next year.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle said Friday, ``The most
likely environment for the least political circumstances involving
a matter of this import would be right after the election.'' The
South Dakota Democrat said that the period between the November
election and the opening of a new Congress in January ``is going to
be the time when you see the least politicized environment in
Washington and in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Well aware that the report's intimate and embarrassing details
of Clinton's sexual encounters with Monica Lewinsky could decide
whether Clinton can survive, some Democrats agonized over the
report's release Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after voting against making the report public, Rep.
James Moran, D-Va., spoke glumly to reporters of ``six months of
torturous hearings and humiliating expose that's going to make the
American people the nation's voyeurs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He may have explanations of this,'' said Moran, who like
Clinton is from the moderate wing of the Democratic Party, ``but it
has to be something better than what we heard Aug. 17. It has got
be something better than weasel words like `legally accurate.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., who also voted against immediate
disclosure, called the moment one of ``fate and history coming
together.'' He added, ``We have to play the hand we've been
dealt.'' He said he would go home to Georgia this weekend to read
the report and then go to houses of worship, shopping centers and
pool halls to talk to constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Although the debate was partisan, lawmakers spoke often Friday
of the gravity of the decisions they must make. ``There is no joy
in bringing forward this resolution,'' said Rep. Gerald Solomon,
R-N.Y., the chairman of the Rules Committee, ``only a sense of the
gravity of our task ahead and mindful of our constitutional
responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the two hours of debate, members of the House looked
back 24 years to the last time Congress moved close to expelling
the nation's chief executive. Richard M. Nixon ultimately resigned
before being impeached by the full House.
</P>
<P>
   ``If President Nixon and President Clinton had offered sincere
apologies in a timely fashion,'' said Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C.,
``the severity of the problems would have been diminished.'' Now,
he said, ``the time for forgiveness'' was past.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Obey, a Wisconsin Democrat, said: ``I was here for
Watergate. I hated it because it bittered up the politics of the
entire country. Not just toward Republicans but toward all
politicians. And we are still suffering from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lopsided vote to make Starr's report public, the
debate showed the House's partisan divide. Democrat after Democrat
protested the House's refusal to give Clinton time to see the
report, while Republicans replied that they owed no courtesies to
the president's public- relations machine.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Clinton's most passionate defenders Friday were black
lawmakers. ``The Congressional Black Caucus has made the decision
to become the fairness cop,'' said the group's leader, Rep. Maxine
Waters, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Waters called for a fair process for Clinton. ``Our struggle
for fairness, justice and equality is a responsibility we have
accepted for the rest of our lives,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt said that he favored making
the report public but protested that the president should have had
the time to read the charges against him. ``This president deserves
that basic fairness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gesturing as he spoke, Gephardt said: ``This is a sacred
process. This goes to the heart of our democracy. This is not a
second election. This is not politics. This is not spinning. This
is not polling. This is not a lynch mob. This is not a witch hunt.
This is not trying to find facts to support our already reached
conclusions. This is a constitutional test.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde replied that Clinton was not being caught by surprise. ``He
knows what's in this report better than anybody on the planet,'' he
said. ``To give the spin machine an opportunity to be the first
impact on the American people before we the members have seen this
report is not bipartisanship. It's foolishness.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said the House acts like a grand jury in an impeachment
inquiry, and that a grand jury does not give evidence to the person
under investigation. He pledged to give Clinton's lawyers the same
rights that Nixon's lawyers were granted during the Watergate
investigation to be present at executive sessions of the House
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom DeLay, the House majority whip, said Clinton ``had his
spinmeisters and his attack dogs out for eight months. He knows
what's in this report.''

   NEW YORK _ More sellers than buyers. That's the glib explanation
for why stocks couldn't keep a good head of steam going last week.
After a fine showing on Tuesday, when the Dow Jones industrial
average jumped 380 points, sellers took back the reins. The Dow
ended the week mustering a 2 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   Where is all the selling coming from? Anecdotal reports have had
institutional investors bailing while individuals hang tough in
their portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Adler at AMG Data Services concurs, reporting that money
continues to head into stock mutual funds, despite recent market
volatility.
</P>
<P>
   In the week ending Wednesday, $1.6 billion went into
large-capitalization growth funds; lesser amounts flowed into
small-stock funds. Net of sales, a total of $1.4 billion went into
equity funds for the week.
</P>
<P>
   More significant, employee contributions to mutual funds via
their retirement plans still seem to be on automatic pilot. ``The
small investor-401(k) base hasn't appeared to have stirred at
all,'' Adler said.
</P>
<P>
   What is stirring is the foreign investor, a huge force in the
market for United States Treasury securities and an increasingly
important one in stocks. By many accounts, foreign investors have
been responsible for much of the recent divesting of stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heavy selling at the market opening is a sign of overseas
investors' getting out,'' said Jack H. Shaughnessy, president of
Boston Advisors Inc., a money management firm. ``It concerns me,
because since 1995 foreign investors have been a big factor behind
rising stock prices.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve Board released data on Friday about
investment in the second quarter of 1998; they show a big slowdown
in net purchases of American equities by foreign residents even
before the market's summer swoon. While these investors bought a
net $116.1 billion of stocks in the first quarter, net purchases in
the second quarter were just $55.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing overseas investors out of equities is the decline of the
dollar against the Japanese yen and the German mark. The dollar is
down 11.2 percent against the yen from its Aug. 11 high; it is down
4.8 percent against the mark in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   When foreign investors buy American stocks, they subject their
portfolios to currency risk in addition to the risk that the shares
will decline. As the dollar weakens, foreigners' investments lose
ground, even if the prices of the underlying shares remain the
same. When the stocks themselves fall, the foreign investor is
doubly hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Shaughnessy says he thinks foreign selling of stocks began in
earnest on July 21. That was the day Alan Greenspan, chairman of
the Federal Reserve, testified before Congress, saying investors'
expectations for continued high levels of corporate earnings growth
had risen to possibly unsustainable levels. ``Foreign investors
either stopped buying then or they started to sell,'' Shaughnessy
said.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign selling of American stocks is likely to continue through
the end of the month. That's because Sept. 30 is the end of the
first half of Japan's fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In September and March, Japanese investors tend to move into
cash,'' explained Carl B. Weinberg, chief economist at High
Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. ``They take profits as best
they can.'' Since they have big losses in Japanese stocks, they'll
probably be selling American stocks. It also means that unless big
buyers emerge elsewhere to support stocks here, investors can
expect further weakness. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans and Democrats alike said Friday that
while there were no stunning revelations, they were deeply troubled
and distressed by details in the report by Kenneth Starr, the
Whitewater independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   But while Democrats were reluctant to defend President Clinton's
behavior as outlined in the report, the initial reaction from both
parties suggested that partisan battle lines were beginning to
emerge: Democrats accused Starr of overreaching by dwelling on
lurid sexual details, and Republicans sought to shift the debate to
the report's conclusions about perjury, obstruction of justice and
witness tampering.
</P>
<P>
   ``The misjudgments of the president are nearly equaled by the
need of Kenneth Starr to provide a level of sexual detail beyond
what was necessary to make his point or establish his case,'' said
Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J. ``His own lack of perspective and
tendency to go to excess undermines his credibility. This level of
sexual detail is clearly intended to inflame public passions.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, who is a member of the Judiciary
Committee, said he was particularly concerned not by the sexual
details but the other evidence. ``The allegations are far more
serious than I had anticipated,'' he said. ``You've got five
allegations of lying under oath; four allegations of obstructing
justice. I think it's more likely than not that the Judiciary
Committee as a whole would recommend that the House consider
initiating the impeachment inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who is chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, also sought to dispel the notion that the
report was only about sex. ``Some will try to make this just purely
a sexual matter,'' he said. ``And they'll try to say this is purely
a private matter. But I don't see anything that I've read so far
that indicates that Judge Starr is saying that he should be
impeached because of the sexual relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as he focused on the non-sexual allegations, Rep. Thomas
Davis, D-Va., did not shy from mentioning the ``very lurid and
graphic details'' in the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``These details will offend most Americans,'' Davis said.
``While demeaning to the institution of the presidency, these
details, alone, do not constitute impeachable offenses. However, if
proven true, the allegations in Judge Starr's report, such as
witness tampering and lying under oath to the grand jury, do
constitute impeachable offenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that Democrats would cast the report as needlessly
digging into Clinton's private conduct with Ms. Lewinsky, some
Republicans said they wished Starr had written been more broadly
about other issues that had been under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The allegation of abuse of office could yet be strengthened by
evidence of the president's role in Travelgate and Filegate and the
other matters under the jurisdiction of the independent counsel,''
said Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y. ``The sexual part of it, the unseemly
part, gives us pause but that is not a ground for impeachment. But
the other stuff potentially is.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the few Democrats who spoke out forcefully in defense of
Clinton was Rep. Robert Wexler of Florida, a member of the
Judiciary Committee, who sought to portray the report as
preoccupied with sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not make more of it than it is,'' he said. ``The
president didn't do what Lyndon Johnson did and lie about Vietnam.
President Clinton did not do what Ronald Reagan did and probably
lie about hostages and arms. The president lied about an
extra-marital affair _ let's put this in context.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another Democrat who spoke out was Rep. Charles Rangel of New
York. Rather than delve into the report itself, Rangel offered a
blanket defense of Clinton. ``We can call for forgiveness or we can
throw stones and cause further embarrassment to the president, his
family and the nation,'' he said. ``But the truth is that the will
of most Americans is that the president stay the course, not only
in his domestic policies but in the international crises.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most striking about the response Friday was that
virtually no other Democratic lawmakers _ not even the Democratic
leaders, Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota or Rep. Dick Gephardt of
Missouri _ or White House political aides rallied to Clinton's
defense, as many did when the allegations about Ms. Lewinsky first
emerged in January. Several members insisted that they needed time
to fully absorb the report; Gephardt's office said he was out of
town at his son's wedding and would have no comment this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were far more eager to speak out about their
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I have been able to review of this report thus
far,'' said Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., ``there appear to me to be
sufficient grounds for the House of Representatives to now begin
the impeachment process.''
</P>
<P>
   While Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said he ``will not rush to
judgment,'' his reaction to the report was far from subdued.
``These allegations are deplorable and disgusting,'' he said,
``and, if true, the president has undoubtedly let the nation
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., who is a member of the Judiciary
Committee, cautioned his colleagues against ``a stampede for
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson said: ``I am personally offended and deeply saddened
by much of the conduct that is described in the report. But it is
imperative for members of the Judiciary Committee not to reach a
conclusion as to whether an impeachment inquiry is justified until
having made a thorough review of all evidence.''

THE WELCOME MAT IS BACK  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J., Ill.)   (af)  
 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is hardly news that 1998 has been a disaster for
small-capitalization stock funds. The average such fund has lost
19.5 percent through Sept. 4, according to Morningstar Inc., the
Chicago financial publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it seems, there is a silver lining of sorts to the selloff:
A clutch of funds that had been closed to new investors have been
opening their doors again.
</P>
<P>
   Four small-cap funds have reopened so far this year: Pioneer
Small Co., Berger Small Company Growth, Oakmark Small Cap and
Montgomery U.S. Emerging Growth. And a fifth fund, Heartland Value
plans to reopen in November.
</P>
<P>
   There are two related reasons for closing a small-stock fund to
start with. The first is the fund's asset size. When money under
management swells, funds can have trouble finding enough suitable
companies in which to invest, as they are barred from holding big
chunks of any individual company. That problem can hurt returns.
</P>
<P>
   But overheated cash flows can also cause a slightly different
problem. When large amounts of cash arrive in a relatively short
time, it becomes difficult for a manager to invest the money
without running up the price of the stocks he or she is buying. The
alternative is for the manager to sit on a large amount of cash and
invest in dribs and drabs.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, in a rising market, shareholders are likely to
suffer. (To be sure, the problem has a very bright side for fund
management; its pay is based on total assets.)
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, of course, as some investors have reconsidered
their rush into stocks, big cash inflows have not been a concern
for most managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market has taken a lot of that concern away,
unfortunately,'' said Bill Keithler, manager of Berger Small
Company Growth, which was closed to new investors in November 1997
and was reopened in May.
</P>
<P>
   Few small-cap funds have been able to escape the carnage, which
has often reduced their asset size. Of 614 such funds tracked by
Morningstar, just six have earned positive returns this year.
(Leading the pack is Weitz Hickory, which returned 17.6 percent
through Sept. 4.)
</P>
<P>
   As for cash, Lipper Analytical Services, the fund research firm
in Summit, N.J. reported that cash flows have narrowed, to just
$2.93 billion for small-cap funds through July 31 of this year
versus $10.45 billion over the corresponding period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   So it's hardly surprising that some previously closed funds are
rolling out the welcome mat again. Montgomery has even made it
easier for new investors to get in, lowering the minimum initial
investment of the reopened fund to $1,000, from $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether investors should buy shares in funds
just because they are reopening their doors. Pioneer Small Co. and
Oakmark Small Cap do not have three-year records, making them tough
calls. Heartland Value underperformed its category-group average
over the three years ended Sept. 4, while Berger Small Co. and
Montgomery U.S. Emerging Growth outperformed their peer group.
</P>
<P>
   But the bottom line is that such results, especially given the
extreme underperformance of small caps recently, may not be
indicative of future performance.
</P>
<P>
   It may be more important for investors to remember that,
historically, smaller stocks have returned a premium over their
bigger brethren in the long term.
</P>
<P>
   From the end of 1925 through Aug. 31 of this year, small-cap
stocks returned 12.2 percent, annualized, versus 10.9 percent for
large-cap stocks, according to Ibbotson Associates, a research firm
in Chicago. So it behooves most investors to keep a portion of
their fund portfolios in small stocks, too.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect too much too soon, experts said. ``It's obvious
that small-cap stocks are really cheap,'' said Susan Dziubinski,
who edits Morningstar Mutual Funds, a newsletter. ``Whether they'll
bounce back is another story.''

MATVICHUK EXTENDS CONTRACT WITH STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Mike Heika 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Stars defenseman Richard Matvichuk yesterday
signed a one-year contract extension and said he expects to keep
open lines of communication for a long-term contract.
</P>
<P>
   Matvichuk, 25, will be paid the same salary as last season,
$871,000, which is something of a bargain in the world of
ever-increasing NHL salaries. But the Stars' first-round pick (No.
8 overall) in the 1991 draft, who is sidelined by reconstructive
knee surgery, said he didn't feel now was the time to be
negotiating a long-term deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not what I wanted to do,'' he said. ``I wanted to be
in training camp and I wanted to be skating, so the easiest thing
to do was just sign my option papers.''
</P>
<P>
   Matvichuk had arbitration rights, but turned down the chance to
take the Stars to a third-party confrontation. Instead, he said he
would let his play speak for itself. Despite missing eight games
with a knee injury and playing three months with no anterior
cruciate ligament in his left knee, Matvichuk led the NHL in
blocked shots with 142 and led the Stars in hits with 222.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a guy who consistently plays 20 to 25 minutes a game, and
that's with no time on the power play,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock
said. ``He's becoming a very big part of our defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Matvichuk said he will attend training camp and participate in
all skating drills, but not contact drills. He had surgery June 23
to replace the ACL in his left knee. He was given a six-month
recovery period, meaning he would be back Dec. 23. However,
Matvichuk has set Nov. 1 as his personal goal to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say it's 85 percent already,'' Matvichuk said. ``It's
coming along a lot faster than I thought it would.''

SWISSAIR CRASH INVESTIGATORS FIND SECOND `BLACK BOX' 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ Canadian navy deep-sea divers have
recovered the cockpit flight recorder from Swissair Flight 111 in
about 180 feet of water not far from where the jet's other ``black
box,'' the flight data recorder, was found last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Commander Kevin Carle said that as a team of divers was
searching the ocean bottom for human remains about 6 p.m. Friday,
they spotted the recorder, which was immediately brought to the
surface and shipped to the Canadian Transportation Safety Board's
Ottawa laboratories for analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have been eager to find the second box because
they hope it will have recorded conversations in the jet's cockpits
during the final minutes of the Swiss jet's flight on Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder recovered Sunday was missing the last
six minutes of the flight, possibly because of an electrical
failure, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation Safety Board spokesman Jim Harris said he had not
received any report of the condition of the recorder found Friday,
nor was there any indication about whether the data it held could
be retrieved. He did not know how long it would take investigators
to determine whether the recording could be played back.
</P>
<P>
   Diving to the wreckage on the ocean bottom had been hampered for
several days by high seas. But a break in the weather Thursday
night allowed a team of Canadian navy divers to resume the search
for the black box and for the remains of the 229 passengers and
crew members who died in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   During the 30 minutes that deep-sea conditions allowed the
divers to be on the ocean bottom, they were able to recover remains
from an unidentified number of victims, officials said, searching
in an area close to where the voice recorders electronic beacon had
been detected.
</P>
<P>
   The remains were brought to the surface and will be used by
medical examiners to determine the identity of victims.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, examiners have identified only four of the victims,
based on remains that have been recovered on the surface of the
ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Another team of divers was sent down more than 180 feet Friday
morning and retrieved more human remains, Commander Rick Town said
during a news conference on board the HMCS Preserver, which
returned to port in Halifax on Friday after more than a week
involved in the rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't describe it to you,'' said Town, referrring to the
grisly underwater landscape of jet debris and shattered bodies that
he monitored through a remote-control camera. ``I don't think
there's a soul on earth who could describe it to you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Preserver, a Canadian navy supply ship, was one of the first
vessels to reach the crash site on the evening of Sept. 2, not long
after the Geneva-bound plane, an MD-11, slammed into the water off
the coast of Nova Scotia as its pilots fought deteriorating
conditions in the cockpit and tried to make an emergency landing.
</P>
<P>
   Transcripts of the pilots' conversations with air traffic
controllers indicate that the cockpit was filled with smoke before
the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Ferguson, superintendent of the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police, said he expected that the Mounted Police would soon be able
to rule out entirely the possibility that the crash was in any way
caused by a criminal act.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found nothing, absolutely nothing, to indicate that
this was an act of criminality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian investigation and recovery effort now totals more
than 1,500 individuals, officials said. In addition, the U.S. Navy
salvage ship Grapple, a heavy rescue ship that was instrumental in
the recovery of large pieces of the wreckage of TWA Flight 800 off
New York two years ago, has been brought to Nova Scotia and will
begin hauling up pieces of the Swissair jet that have already been
located.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, Swissair offered a more complete account of
problems it has had with an electrical part on the MD-11 that
crashed off Nova Scotia last week, a version that is slightly
different from the one given by investigators Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The part, located in the electronics bay under the cockpit, is
called a DC tie bus, and is a component of the plane's 28-volt
direct-current system.
</P>
<P>
   After Swissair fixed a problem with the part on a plane in
Bangkok on Aug. 3, officials decided, as a precaution, to replace
that part on all 16 of the MD-11s it then had in its fleet, said
Hans Klaus, a Swissair spokesman. The next day, a mechanic
attempted to do so on the plane that crashed off Nova Scotia almost
a month later, while it was in Zurich, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, said Klaus, the mechanic installed the relay backward, and
when the electricity was switched back on, it created a short
circuit. ``As a result of this short circuit, we had a kind of
electrical soot,'' he said. Klaus said that although there was
soot, there was not, as investigators described it Thursday, a
minor fire.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say they are interested in the history of the
airline's experience with the part, because of the two incidents.
They said they were interested in anything that could have ignited
a fire in the electronics bay, which other evidence points to as a
probable location of fire in the crash.

CLINTON MOBILIZES DEFENSE TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES AND BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With little more than the public's mercy to fall
back on, President Clinton tearfully described himself Friday as a
sinner on a lonely quest for redemption and mobilized his defense
team to portray allegations against him as an ``extravagantly
exaggerated'' attempt by Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr to
bring him down.
</P>
<P>
   The White House unveiled the dual strategy as Starr's report
became public, providing reams of details to underscore allegations
that Clinton engaged in 11 possible impeachable offenses, including
abusing the power of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton began his humiliating day with his most contrite appeal
yet for forgiveness and his first apology to Monica S. Lewinsky.
Eight months after he denied engaging in a sexual relationship with
``that woman, Miss Lewinsky,'' a former White House intern, the
president told religious leaders at a breakfast meeting: ``I have
sinned.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to me that everybody who has been hurt knows
that the sorrow I feel is genuine: first and most important, my
family, also my friends, my staff, my Cabinet, Monica Lewinsky and
her family, and the American people,'' Clinton said in the
chandeliered East Room of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But even as he described himself as a ``broken spirit'' seeking
spiritual guidance ``to repair breaches of my own making,'' Clinton
sent notice that he plans to defend his presidency amid calls for
his resignation and a preliminary impeachment inquiry by the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will instruct my lawyers to mount a vigorous defense, using
all available appropriate arguments,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The counterattack came swiftly. Before the seals could be broken
on the boxes of Starr's report, Clinton's lawyers -- White House
counsel Charles F. C. Ruff, and David E. Kendall, the president's
private attorney -- released their 78-page rebuttal. The
``preliminary memorandum'' was skimpy on specific evidence related
to the allegations but filled with legal arguments about why
Clinton's actions were not impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Although the lawyers acknowledged Clinton's ``serious mistake''
relating to his illicit affair with Lewinsky, they charged that
Starr ``dangerously overreached'' in trying to cast events
surrounding an inappropriate sexual relationship as impeachable
offenses.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the risky political strategy, Clinton's legal team
lashed out at the voluminous amount of sordid details in Starr's
report about Clinton's sexual encounters with Lewinsky in the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The salacious allegations in this referral are simply intended
to humiliate, embarrass and politically damage the president,''
Kendall said in a White House briefing. ``In short, this is
personal and not impeachable.''
</P>
<P>
   Copies of the White House rebuttal were immediately dispatched
to House and Senate leaders in both parties before they were
released to the public and a version was posted on the Internet
beside the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   In the White House report, the lawyers framed Clinton's misdeeds
as little more than the product of a sadly familiar scenario
involving a married man trying to lawfully conceal an adulterous
relationship. They asserted that Clinton's affair and his efforts
to cover it up do not meet the threshold for impeachment because
they were not public acts, performed by Clinton in a public
capacity, affecting the public interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simple reality of this situation is that the House is
being confronted with evidence of a man's efforts to keep an
inappropriate relationship private...,'' Kendall and Ruff stated in
their written rebuttal. ``Such a personal failing does not,
however, constitute `treason, bribery and high crimes and
misdemeanors' that would justify the impeachment of the President
of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the lawyers argued, Clinton's fate ``must be left to
the court of public opinion and the judgment of history.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Clinton would accept a congressional censure short of
impeachment, Ruff said, ``If you're talking about a censure or
public unhappiness with the president over what he did in his
personal capacity, there is no question that he is feeling that
right now. But we're not talking about something formal that would
reach out and impose more pain on the president than he is already
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Michael McCurry also said Clinton
``absolutely'' does not plan to resign.
</P>
<P>
   As a prelude to his lawyers' rebuttal, Clinton told the
religious leaders he has ``been on quite a journey these last few
weeks to get to the end of this, to the rock bottom truth of where
I am and where we all are.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that even as he pursues his presidential duties and
political comeback, ``I will continue on the path of repentance,
seeking pastoral support and that of other caring people so they
can hold me accountable for my own commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he asked everyone he had wronged for forgiveness.
But White House officials said the president sought Lewinsky's
forgiveness only through his public statement, not in a personal
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Against that backdrop, Clinton's lawyers sought to refute each
of Starr's allegations of possible impeachable offenses, including
perjury, obstruction of justice, witness tampering, and abusing the
power of his office.
</P>
<P>
   They said Clinton made no effort to obstruct justice by
retrieving his gifts to Lewinsky after she had been subpoenaed to
testify in the Jones suit, as Starr's report alleges. The gifts
were not a concern to Clinton, according to the lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they said, Clinton acknowledged giving Lewinsky goodbye
gifts last Dec. 28, nine days after she was subpoeaned in the Jones
case.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Clinton's lawyers argued there was no connection
between the timing of Lewinsky's affidavit in the Jones suit in
which she denied having an affair with the president, and help
given her in a job search.

ELLIS KERLEY, 74, A FORENSIC SHERLOCK HOLMES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Md., Hawaii, Ky., N.C., Ga., Puerto Rico)  (lb) 
 By FORD BURKHART   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Ellis R. Kerley, a forensic anthropologist whose expertise
was widely sought in the identification of human remains, including
those of the Nazi war criminal Josef Mengele and victims of the
Jonestown suicides in Guyana, died on Sept. 3 at a hospice in San
Diego. He was 74 and lived in Lake San Marcos, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was leukemia, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Kerley devised a way to derive precise knowledge, often
including positive identification, from remains as small as a bone
fragment. The techniques are widely used today and are particularly
important in identifying victims of mass killings and other
large-scale disasters like airplane crashes.
</P>
<P>
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration recognized his
skills in 1986 and hired him to study the Challenger shuttle
disaster, said Dr. William Stuart, a professor of anthropology at
the University of Maryland, where Kerley was a professor for 17
years and was head of the anthropology department.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Kerley had helped anthropologists at the Smithsonian
Institution with its forensic assignments, including identification
of Korean War dead. In addition to being summoned to Jonestown,
Guyana, in 1978, he was called on after the 1980 Marine helicopter
crash in Iran in which eight people died in an unsuccessful effort
to rescue American hostages in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   He also worked for a House investigation of the assassination of
President John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   But Kerley is perhaps best known for his 1985 assignment in
which he and 16 other experts analyzed the bones from a grave in
Brazil and concluded that they were the remains of the fugitive
Mengele, who was said to have died there _ under another name _ in
1979.
</P>
<P>
   After a week of sifting through X-rays and data from crumbling
bones, Kerley found a hipbone fracture that matched a report of an
injury Mengele suffered in a motorcycle accident at Auschwitz. He
also noticed a gap between front teeth that matched a 1938 military
photograph of the smiling Mengele.
</P>
<P>
   Kerley also noted that Mengele, wanted for torture and the
gassing of 400,000 people at the Auschwitz concentration camp, had
``a rather painful bunion on his right foot.'' At the end, he said,
everything pointed to the same conclusion. ``I feel quite
confident,'' he said, ``this is indeed Mengele.''
</P>
<P>
   He also was invited to examine skeletal remains repatriated from
France and believed to be those of John Paul Jones, the
Revolutionary War naval commander. He confirmed that
identification.
</P>
<P>
   In the late '80s, he worked for the Army Central Identification
Laboratory in Hawaii, identifying the Vietnam War dead.
</P>
<P>
   One technique _ now known as the Kerley method _ involved
mathematical analysis of data derived from cross-sections of
fragments of long bones from the arms and legs, said a former
student, Dr. Rebecca Huss-Ashmore, now an associate professor of
anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   He would take a cross-section of a bone fragment and look for
areas of altered bone. Bone gets weak as people age, and as new
cells enter the original bone, they chew away older parts of the
bone and then incompletely fill it in, in a process related to
osteoporosis, Dr. Ashmore said. The new bone tissue forms
concentric circles, leaving a cavity.
</P>
<P>
   The data from several areas of the bone can be entered into a
computer and the age can be roughly determined.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with other clues, the bone fragment can aid in
identifications from a list of possible victims.
</P>
<P>
   Kerley brought to his work a range of expertise, Dr.
Huss-Ashmore said, and in particular was ``simply an outstanding
bone biologist.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kerley method ``epitomizes the development of modern
physical anthropology,'' said Stuart. He added that Kerley was the
leading anthropologist of his generation in creating the science of
forensic anthropology.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kerley was born in Covington, Ky., and received his B.A. from
the University of Kentucky and his M.A. and Ph.D. from the
University of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   He served in the Army in World War II and later worked for the
Army and the Veterans Administration, doing research on age changes
and evolutionary patterns in bones. He also was a staff
anthropologist at Bowman Gray School of Medicine in Winston-Salem,
N.C., and taught anatomy at the Medical Center of the University of
Puerto Rico. He joined the University of Maryland in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife, Mary Adams Kerley, and three
daughters, Amy Kerley Moorhouse of Atlanta, MaryElise Kerley of
Honolulu, and Laurelann Bundens of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   He kept a paper-thin slice of thigh bone from the Nazi Mengele
on the piano in the living room of his home, where talk of cadavers
was not uncommon at the dinner table, his daughter Amy recalled.
</P>
<P>
   His family often became part of his consulting career, so it was
no surprise when the Chicago police, finding that he was on
vacation, sent a cadaver to his home where the family kept it for
him in the basement over the weekend. ``It was memorable,'' his
daughter recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his newsworthy moments, Kerley was especially proud of
his small successes, his wife said, including the identification of
an air-crash victim from one small bone. ``He had a great deal of
love for the cadavers he dealt with,'' she said. ``He treated them
with dignity, compassion and respect.''

SOSA HITS NO. 59 AS CUBS LOSE TO BREWERS, 13-11
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BILL DEDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The wind was blowing out fiercely at Wrigley Field on
Friday afternoon, but Sammy Sosa did not need the help, blasting
his 59th home run an estimated 435 feet onto Sheffield Avenue
beyond right field. With a live television audience watching back
home in the Dominican Republic, Sosa moved closer to baseball's new
record-holder, Mark McGwire, who hit his 62nd on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's home run was the highlight of the day for the Cubs, who
dropped a wild 13-11 decision to the Milwaukee Brewers and failed
again to gain ground in their battle with the Mets and Giants for
the National League wild card.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs showed the strain of not having Kerry Wood, their
injured rookie pitcher, who will be out another week or more with a
sprained elbow. They used seven pitchers to get through nine
innings. Brewers pitcher Bill Pulsipher, the former Met, could not
make it out of the fifth inning. Pulsipher yielded 11 hits and nine
runs, including homers by Sosa (on an outside curveball), by
veteran Gary Gaetti (his 16th, a shot estimated at 490 feet onto
Waveland Avenue beyond left field), and by the rookie Jason Maxwell
(his first major league hit).
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's blast was seen on the first live national broadcast of a
Cubs game in the Dominican Republic. Previously, the games were
available only by satellite. When Sosa connected in the fifth, he
got a curtain call from the crowd of 37,410 that nearly filled
Wrigley. Two innings earlier, his fly ball to right fell just short
of the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's 59th puts him ahead of Hank Greenberg and Jimmie Foxx,
who each hit 58 home runs in a single season. Now only McGwire,
Roger Maris and Babe Ruth stand ahead of him.

LEONID KINSKEY, 95, BARTENDER IN `CASABLANCA' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz.)   (bl)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leonid Kinskey, the Russian-born character actor best known for
his portrayal of Sascha, the bartender in Rick's Cafe Americain in
``Casablanca,'' died Sept. 8 in Fountain Hills, Ariz. He was 95.
</P>
<P>
   In his most memorable role, Kinskey was one of the vivid
nightclub characters who plotted against the Nazis and France's
Vichy regime in the Oscar-winning 1942 Michael Curtiz film, which
starred Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman.
</P>
<P>
   In a well-remembered scene, Bogart as Rick arranges for a young
Hungarian couple, played by Helmut Dantine and Joy Page, to win
enough at roulette to pay for an exit visa, which spares the
beautiful young wife the need to obtain the document by sleeping
with the chief of police, portrayed by Claude Rains.
</P>
<P>
   Sascha, overcome by the usually cynical Rick's romantic
generosity, kisses him and says, ``Boss, you've done a beautiful
thing.'' And Rick snarls, ``Go away, you crazy Russian.''
</P>
<P>
   Aljean Harmetz, the author of ``Round Up the Usual Suspects: The
Making of Casablanca,'' published in 1992 by Hyperion, said Friday
that Kinskey was not the first choice to play Sascha. Production of
the film was under way when a decision was made to replace Leon
Mostovoy as the bartender because he wasn't funny enough.
</P>
<P>
   Kinskey told Ms. Harmetz that he got the role because he was a
drinking buddy of Bogart's. He signed a contract for a guaranteed
two weeks at $750 a week, and the name of the character he played
was changed from Fyodor to Sascha.
</P>
<P>
   The role was but one of many that cast Kinskey as a foreigner
and often as an exaggerated version of one.
</P>
<P>
   The names of the characters he played were themselves frequently
indicative: Ivan Boultonoff in ``On Your Toes'' (1939); Ivan Ianski
in ``Broadway Limited'' (1941); Comrade Nicky in ``He Stayed for
Breakfast'' (1940); Boris in ``Lady for a Night'' (1942); Pierre in
``That Night in Rio'' (1941), and ``Rafael'' in ``Week-End in
Havana'' (1942).
</P>
<P>
   Kinskey, whose name was sometimes spelled Kinsky, was in fact
something of a citizen of the world. He was born on April 18, 1903,
in St. Petersburg, Russia, and performed across Europe and in South
America before he arrived in the United States in the 1930s and
found work in Hollywood, starting in 1932 in Ernst Lubitsch's
comedy ``Trouble in Paradise.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinskey appeared in more than 30 films, including ``Duck Soup''
(1933), ``Les Miserables'' (1933), ``Algiers'' (1938), ``The Story
of Vernon and Irene Castle'' (1939), ``The Fighting Seabees''
(1944), ``Monsieur Beaucaire'' (1946) and ``The Man With the Golden
Arm'' (1955).
</P>
<P>
   After the mid-1950s, he appeared occasionally on television and
directed and produced industrial shows.
</P>
<P>
   Kinskey's wife, Iphigenie Castigloni, an Austrian who played
small roles in Hollywood films, predeceased him.

DAVENPORT CONTINUES SURGE TO THE FINAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lindsay Davenport, bidding for her first spot ever in
a Grand Slam tennis final, just wanted to stay calm and put in some
first serves.
</P>
<P>
   Serve one: Venus Williams hit a forehand return wide. Serve two:
Williams returned long. Then Williams put another forehand into the
net. On match point, another return was long, so Davenport, the No.
2 seed, will face defending champion Martina Hingis Saturday for
the US Open title.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport eliminated Williams, 6-4, 6-4, after Hingis came back
from a 4-1 deficit in the third set to beat Jana Novotna, 3-6, 6-4,
6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport's reaction after three unsuccessful trips to Grand
Slam semifinals, including this year's Australian and French Opens?
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the return was going long, and really, it was just ...
it was just relief, it was happiness, it was joy, obviously,
getting to my first final,'' she said. ``Really, it was just almost
like you can't believe it. I mean, no one ever said when I was
growing up I was ever going to be any good or get to a Grand Slam
final. In my teens, I wasn't expected to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-3-inch Davenport, 22, won the battle of heavy hitters
against the 6-2 Williams, 18, and now it will be her power against
the finesse of Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she was stepping into her balls well,'' said Williams,
who lost to Hingis in last year's final. ``She's probably been
practicing using her power to her advantage. And she's one of the
more powerful players on the tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport hopes to put that to good use against Hingis in a
battle of the world's first- and second-ranked women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, for me, I think I have to be attacking from the first
couple balls, especially the second serve,'' said Davenport, who's
No. 2. ``I have to serve well. She can get frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss cost Williams a repeat appearance in the final _ and a
chance to show off the last in a series of Reebok-made dresses for
the Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to put that one in a coffin and bury it,'' Williams
said. ``It was red, white, and blue. Of course, matching hair and
nails.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport won three straight tournaments in August before losing
to Steffi Graf in New Haven heading into the Open. She has not lost
a set here.
</P>
<P>
   ``She won the last three tournaments in California,'' Hingis
said. ``That says about everything about Lindsay. She's a very
solid player on hard court in the US. She has a big chance to win
the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last of that run in California, Davenport beat Hingis in
three sets to win at Manhattan Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Something has to give Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things she was thinking about as she struggled early
in the third set against Novotna, Hingis said, was that she doesn't
often lose to the same player two times in a row.
</P>
<P>
   And Hingis had already lost to Novotna, her doubles partner, in
the semis at Wimbledon. Nor was Hingis, who also lost in the semis
at the French Open, excited about making it three straight and out
in the semis.
</P>
<P>
   Then she turned the match around, winning 18 of the last 22
points.
</P>
<P>
   Novotna, who has had trouble closing out matches in the past,
was serving and up, 4-1, and it was 30-30 when Hingis ripped a
forehand cross-court winner. On break point, Novotna put a forehand
into the net and the turnabout was on.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis won a game at love after Novotna sailed an easy forehand
volley far long. Then she broke Novotna again and it was 4-4.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis won her service game easily, and Novotna served to stay
alive. She fell into a 15-40 hole and watched helplessly at the net
as a Hingis lob went over her head and barely out of bounds. Then
Novotna put a forehand into the net and it was over and she stood
for several seconds at the baseline before going to meet Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   The first set was all Novotna, the second all Hingis. Hingis,
who had 11 unforced errors in the first set as Novotna controlled
the net, had only eight more the rest of the match. Novotna made 50
errors to 19 for Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis, who had what for her was a rough summer _ she didn't win
a title in six straight tournaments _ earned a shot at defending
her title.
</P>
<P>
   She has been feeling better and better about her tennis here,
especially since a 6-4, 6-4 win over Monica Seles in the
quarterfinals.

   BIJELJINA, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ It has gone pretty well for
Ljubisa Savic in the six years since his paramilitary units helped
take over this city in eastern Bosnia, where almost everyone who
was not a Serb was terrorized, robbed, killed or expelled.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomats who court Savic now _ they call this Serbian
politician and police chief by his nickname, Mauser _ say he is the
most important man in this city, the second largest in the
Serbian-controlled part of Bosnia, and they need his support for
their mission to bring justice and democracy to the country.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend sees what should be another important, possibly
crucial, stage of that mission. Bosnians are to vote for their
three-man joint presidency, federal Parliament and leaders of the
country's two halves _ the Bosnia Serb republic and the
Muslim-Croat Federation.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that in their search for Bosnians to lead the
country, Western officials consider Savic to be the kind of man
they need.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the time for nice people,'' a Western diplomat
said. ``This is a time for effective leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   This premium on pragmatism stems from the belief of most of the
foreign diplomats, soldiers, aid workers and other peacemakers
spread across Bosnia that its government is still a facade held up
only by Western money and the foreign protectors whose daily
badgering and dictates are finally producing some results.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we go, the program crashes,'' a European diplomat said.
``Progress is good, but not good enough to endure without
coordinated pressure every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Savic, whose war record makes him feared by some Serbs and
respected by others, was a target for Western attention because he
seemed ready to consider a loosely unified country and harmony with
Croats and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Like almost all Bosnian Serb leaders, however, he is still not
prepared to allow the people expelled during the war to return home
_ the step identified by most foreigners, and many Bosnians, as the
key to allowing the country to begin to return to normal.
</P>
<P>
   So Rasim and Senada Durakovic, both Muslims, still cannot come
back to their home in Bijeljina, a town of some 100,000 that was
one-third non-Serb before the war.
</P>
<P>
   They live instead in a Muslim city, Tuzla, 35 miles away, in an
unfinished house with no plumbing. These days they chop firewood
for the winter and pray that one of them finds a job so they can
pay the rent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who were in charge of Bijeljina when we were
expelled are in charge today, only now they are richer,'' Senada
Durakovic said. ``They have what they took from all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Her fate illustrates how hard it is to dislodge the victors of
Bosnia's war, and the problems caused by the many foreign voices
and powers pulling this divided country in different directions at
the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most contentious dispute erupted this year when
Germany ignored the pleas of other countries and international
organizations and forced refugees to return to Bosnia even though
most of them could not go back to their homes. Most of the 160,000
Bosnians sent from Germany are Muslims or Croats who were expelled
by the Serbian authorities during the 1992-95 war.
</P>
<P>
   The Durakovic family was put on a bus this month and wound up,
with just a few hundred dollars, on the street in Tuzla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow the West was very efficient in getting us out of
Germany,'' said Rasim Durakovic, 46. ``But no one has been
efficient in helping us get home.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 2 million refugees, about half Bosnia's prewar population,
have not returned to their homes, the United Nations says. Fewer
than 5,000 have gone back to homes in an area where they are an
ethnic minority.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the chief international agency that coordinates
putting the 1995 peace agreement into effect, the Office of the
High Representative, conducted its first full-scale review of the
peace effort and found serious shortcomings, including those of
refugee return and restructuring of the police to end control of
governing politicians.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Western official familiar with the review predicted
that it would be at least 2001 before Bosnia could stand even
remotely alone.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the country still consists of three ministates. In
each, nationalist leaders _ be they Serb, Croat or Muslim _ base
their right to govern on fear. They say only that they offer
protection from the two other ethnic groups, and seem likely to
triumph _ once again _ with that message in this weekend's voting.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign officials investigating the finances of all levels of
Bosnian government estimated this week that $600 million, or as
much as 25 percent of all annual government revenue, is being lost
through corruption. Further, diplomats say, $9 million was taken by
officials from the Central Bank controlled by the Muslim
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Developed countries all over the world are giving a lot of
money to help Bosnia stand upright again,'' a Western diplomat
said. ``The politicians here steal their own government's money so
their government can't do its part.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign countries have committed $1.2 billion in aid projects to
Bosnia this year.

</P>
<P>
   With increasing vigor, Western governments have tried to break
the hold of politicians in power since before the war.
</P>
<P>
   Considering Bosnian Serb leaders the most difficult, they
focused on them first and tried to find leaders who might make
democrats. Savic seems to show the successes and failures of that
policy.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he formed a political party in the Bosnian Serbs'
republic. Last year his party, like Western governments, strongly
supported Biljana Plavsic, president of the Serbian half of Bosnia,
when she broke with the most corrupt and most extreme nationalist
Bosnian Serb political party, founded by Radovan Karadzic, who is
accused of war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Karadzic and his associates, who controlled the Bosnia Serb
republic, blocked key elements of the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Plavsic challenged him last summer, U.S. and British
soldiers helped her secure control of key police stations. Western
governments, led by the United States, said Mrs. Plavsic would back
the peace effort. To encourage her, they bathed the Bosnian Serb
republic in aid.
</P>
<P>
   She became more amenable to some Western requests, allowing some
reform of the police and the government-controlled broadcast
network. In addition, she dismissed many officials who supported
Karadzic.
</P>
<P>
   Savic, his dark past overlooked by Western officials, got the
powerful post of head of the 8,500 uniformed police working for
Mrs. Plavsic. He said his personal battle was to rid the Bosnian
Serb government of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may be a nationalist because I care about the Serb people,''
he said in an interview. ``But I see that some people call
themselves nationalists so they can get rich by stealing from the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   After an attempt to blow up Savic's car and the assassination of
one of his investigators, Savic and other top police officials
began arresting people close to Karadzic.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Western diplomats say, they discovered that some of
those being interrogated by Savic were also being tortured. Unarmed
U.N. police monitors, with NATO troops nearby, were sent to rescue
the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to do about Mauser,'' a U.N. official said.
``Some people want him fired, and by all rights he should be, but
considering what we have to work with, he is one of the heroes.''

STARR REPORT PUTS CRIMP IN U.S. OPEN COVERAGE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Coverage of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's
report to Congress on President Clinton forced CBS on Friday to
pre-empt the first two sets of Martina Hingis' semifinal victory
over Jana Novotna at the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   CBS News broke into the men's doubles final several times for
special reports on Starr's findings and later cut into the
Hingis-Novotna match from 1:45 to 3:10 p.m. before returning after
the first game of the third set.
</P>
<P>
   CBS never asked the USA Network, which has been carrying the
tournament on cable television, to take over the match because of
uncertainty about the length of the pre-emptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no rules about when they'd get on and off,'' said
Gordon Beck, senior vice president of the USA Network. ``They were
playing it by ear. They needed to make a definitive decision to
pre-empt for us to take it.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS Sports spokeswoman LeslieAnne Wade said, ``CBS has a
responsibility to carry breaking national news.''
</P>
<P>
   The network did carry the second women's semifinal, between
Lindsay Davenport and Venus Williams, with minor interruptions for
news reports.

   CHICAGO _ There were howls of laughter inside the Chicago Board
of Trade, where stock traders and runners huddled around computer
screens, some of them reacting to the lurid revelations as if it
were mere entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sounds like the end for Clinton,'' said Paul Cameron, a
stock trader, saying that the president had become a laughingstock.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans were at work Friday afternoon when the graphic
descriptions of President Clinton's sexual relationship with a
former White House intern began appearing on computer screens, on
televisions and radio. And the talk in offices became a surreal mix
of fraternity house jocularity and serious discussion over whether
an American president would be forced to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Even among Clinton's supporters, many people here said the
sexually explicit nature of the president's actions would make it
difficult for people to look at him without thinking about his
actions with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now people have these images in their mind of the president,''
said Glen Gardener, a 29-year-old stock trader. ``And I'm sure
that's why Starr put them in his report.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people sat slack-jawed before their computers, saying they
were shocked by the president's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just couldn't picture the president doing these kinds of
things,'' said Andrea Simons, a 22-year-old accountant, as she
waited for a bus on Michigan Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Others said there was nothing here they had not heard before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already heard every bit of this,'' said Cynthia Wheeler,
a 30-year-old stock trader.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wheeler shrugged her shoulders about the sexual revelations,
but said the president's untruthfulness was unforgivable. ``This
report makes it very, very clear that he lied,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock floor, some traders looked up at a ticker tape that
disclosed that the president was having sex while talking on the
telephone with lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, the ticker said lawnmakers,'' said Mike Morganstern,
a 29-year-old trader. ``That's partly why we were all laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   To Morganstern, the biggest problem surrounding the scandal is
the nation's image, which is taking a battering in some European
countries that find the scandal much ado about a private matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every other G-7 country is looking at us and thinking, `How
immature,''' Morganstern said. ``The real threat is that people
with assets in this country will want to take them out.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people bristled that the entire episode was a sorry mess,
from the misbehavior of the president to the way the matter has
dominated the news and the talk among American people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an embarrassment to all of us, really,'' said Ilan
Shalit, a 23-year-old stock exchange worker. ``The whole thing is a
mockery.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, the Starr report and its possible effects on the
financial markets, had been the object of weeks of speculation.
Friday, however, the stock market rallied more than 100 points in
the afternoon and traders attributed part of the rise to the lack
of surprises in the Starr report.
</P>

<P>
   Callers to talk radio on WLS in Chicago had little else on their
minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted for him in 1992 knowing he was a player _ what's the
big deal?'' said one caller. As the disclosures moved swiftly to
radio stations, some listeners were jolted by the explicit nature
of the discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Lambert, a 31-year-old truck driver, was listening to a
sports show when the talk suddenly turned to discussions of oral
sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it's not too cool if there's kids listening right
now,'' said Lambert, who like many people objected to the public
airing of details that once made people blush.

STARR REPORT TELLS THE STORY OF A SAD, STRANGE RELATIONSHIP

 By JILL ABRAMSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ She called him ``Big Guy'' and smuggled presents
and notes to him in the Oval Office. He told her she made him feel
young and that he loved her energy and smile.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship that Monica Lewinsky described to Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr's grand jury began with furtive Oval Office
kisses and sexual encounters but deepened into something that, at
least to her, was deeply emotional. ``I never expected to fall in
love with the president,'' she testified, ``I was surprised that I
did.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has told prosecutors a different story. He
said a relationship that began as a friendship became
inappropriately intimate. ``I never should have started it,'' he
testified. He said he was deeply torn about their dealings, and
testified that after one of his encounters with Ms. Lewinsky, he
``was sick after it was over.''
</P>
<P>
   But even after a 445-page narrative that depicts their
relationship in graphic detail, Starr's report to the House sheds
little light on the central mystery at the heart of the sex and
perjury investigation that has engulfed Clinton for the last eight
months: Why would the most powerful man in the world risk such a
dangerous liaison _ conducted under the noses of Secret Service
agents and staff _ with a 22-year-old woman wearing the pink pass
of a White House intern around her neck.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship the report does depict is at once sad and
strange. Often in her own words and with amazingly detailed
recollections for dates and atmospherics, Ms. Lewinsky emerges from
these pages as being, alternately, aggressive, needy, besotted and
demanding to the point of becoming extortionate.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Ms. Lewinsky initiated the relationship in the fall
of 1995, she said, during the shutdown of the federal government
with what she called ``intense flirting.'' Their first sexual
encounter began after she gave him a glimpse of her underwear. Much
later, she wrote the president a letter threatening to disclose
their relationship and pressed him hard for help getting a job.
</P>
<P>
   But the calculating Ms. Lewinsky is offset by an insecure young
woman who worried, during her third sexual encounter with the
president, that he didn't even remember her name. She asked him
soon after whether their relationship was just ``about sex'' or
whether the president had ``some interest in trying to get to know
me as a person,'' she testified. She said she didn't even have a
substantial conversation with Clinton until their sixth encounter.
</P>
<P>
   The president emerges from the report in equally contradictory
ways. On the one hand, he was deeply torn about his behavior. Ms.
Lewinsky sensed early on that he felt it was wrong to be involved
with an intern. He broke off the relationship twice, only to resume
sex with her. Until 1997, towards the end of the relationship, he
did not let her bring him to climax, telling her, during one
encounter, they he didn't trust her enough. And, after a 1997
encounter in which Ms. Lewinsky said the president soiled her
dress, he said he felt sick afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   The accounts of their relationship given by Clinton and Ms.
Lewinsky conflict in important ways. Ms. Lewinsky said her
relationship began in November, 1995, while she was an intern and
included ten sexual encounters, eight of which occurred while she
was working at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his testimony and in a 73-page rebuttal to Starr's
report released by the White House Friday, said the relationship
began later and was less extensive. The rebuttal statement
emphasized that it was Clinton who broke off their sporadic
encounters in early 1997 ``because he knew they were wrong.''
Another supporter of the president, Rev. J. Philip Wogaman, his
pastor at Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington, has also
said that the president broke off the relationship and began
privately seeking forgiveness before it became public last January.
</P>
<P>
   The portrait of the relationship in Starr's report is based
mostly on Ms. Lewinsky's grand jury testimony, given under a grant
of immunity from prosecution. It is also based on the testimony and
tapes of Linda Tripp, Ms. Lewinsky's former friend, in whom Ms.
Lewinsky confided many details about her encounters with the
president, as well as the statements before the grand jury of other
friends and family members to whom Ms. Lewinsky spoke.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, Ms. Lewinsky confided in 11 people,
including her therapist, about her sexual encounters with the
president ``as they occurred.'' She also put together an 11-page
chart for Starr's team of prosecutors listing each encounter and
phone call from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It is also based on other evidence, such as Ms. Lewinsky's now
infamous Gap cocktail dress, which the report said is stained with
DNA material that matches the president, and with phone logs that
confirm some of Ms. Lewinsky's recollections.

NORTH TEXAS' GAME PLAN: STOP TEXAS TECH'S WILLIAMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENTON, Texas _ Eric Russell clutched a script in his hand, 50
plays for North Texas' defense to rehearse.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he needed somebody to play the role of Texas Tech tailback
Ricky Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have anybody like that,'' mused Russell, UNT's
defensive line coach.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is faster than a hiccup, shiftier than the San Andreas
Fault and as dangerous as that other Ricky Williams from Texas.
Stopping him becomes UNT's problem at 6:35 tonight at Texas
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   His film debut certainly impressed UNT players and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Highlights from Saturday's game against UT-El Paso show him
rushing 41 times for 251 yards and two touchdowns. Many of his
yards came after the first would-be tackler had made contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think he's small and jittery; he does a lot of
strong running,'' Eagles defensive tackle Brian Waters said. ``He's
an inside runner, all he needs is a little crease and he hits it
real hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, a sophomore from Duncanville, also has a luxury of
burying himself behind a line that averages 320-plus pounds across.
His 5-foot-7 frame is unseen until a crevice opens.
</P>
<P>
   Then he attacks, his burst of speed, his ability to deke a
linebacker, his strength making him tough to tackle.
</P>
<P>
   UNT has practiced a number of scripts on handling him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swarm to the ball,'' suggested defensive tackle Zeb Cornist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do a good job wrapping up,'' Waters added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very simple, very simple, at least that's what my high school
coach used to say about any big task,'' Eagles linebacker Fred
Pertile said. ``We got to really, really contain this guy and when
we hit him, to make it hurt. That's what we've been concentrating
on in practice _ when you hit him make him stop right there.''
</P>
<P>
   In practice if a tackler missed ``Ricky Williams,'' he had to
stop and do up-and-downs.
</P>
<P>
   The part of ``Ricky Williams'' was being played by Dustin Dean,
a freshman walk-on from Forney High School. He's a bit slower and a
bit less-heralded. ``I don't think I fool anybody,'' Dean admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Instead ``Ricky Williams'' has served as a reminder of what lies
ahead with the real Ricky Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``They accept the challenge and they know they got one in front
of them,'' Russell said. ``Hopefully, we can get one (defender) to
hold on and a bunch of others to come and get him to the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that's an ending to Russell's script that he can stomach.

   Bill Viqueira is about to have one of the most interesting jobs
in the telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he has been snoozing lately. As vice president for
corporate development at Lucent Technologies Inc., Viqueira been in

years he has directed about a dozen acquisitions worth some $3.5
billion.

   But on Oct. 1 his professional life will change in a big way.
That is when Lucent, two years after formally splitting from the
AT&AMP;T Corp., will be able to use a form of merger accounting that
could allow the company to add the prefix ``mega'' to its merger
plans.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Lucent would not comment substantively on what
the change would mean to the company and to the overall
communications industry, which is simultaneously growing and
consolidating. Viqueira would not comment at all. But Oct. 1 is a
date circled in red in the minds of communications executives,
analysts, bankers and investors across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have even been obsessed with it,'' said Steven D.
Levy, a communications equipment analyst for Lehman Brothers. ``One
camp is, `I'm staying away from Lucent because if they're going to
do something big on Oct. 1 it's probably not good.' And then I hear
people saying, `I'm going to buy a certain stock because Lucent is
going to buy them on Oct. 1.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Lucent will be able to pursue a much larger class of acquisition
come October because the company will be able to use a form of
accounting called pooling of interests, which is much more
advantageous than the purchase accounting with which it is now
stuck.
</P>
<P>
   A company must be independent for two years before it can pool;
Lucent spun off from AT&AMP;T on Oct. 1, 1996. Under purchase
accounting, an acquiring company must take charges against its
future earnings to cover the difference between what it paid and
the target's assessed book value.
</P>
<P>
   In the technology sector the amount of that difference, known as
goodwill, can be a major part of the purchase price, because
technology companies are often valued largely for intangibles like
the quality of their research efforts and personnel.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Microsoft and General Electric have comparable
market values of about $250 billion, but very different book
values: $304 billion versus only $14 billion, respectively. So
buying GE would not entail writing off any goodwill, but buying
Microsoft would mean writing off nearly the whole purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   Purchase accounting can make big deals hard to pull off,
especially for companies like Lucent with relatively conservative
shareholders who resist dilutions of earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Pooling solves that problem by allowing a company to pay for
acquisitions with stock and to avoid having to write off any
goodwill.
</P>
<P>
   So while Lucent has been doing deals, they have so far been
relatively small. The largest was its $1.8 billion acquisition of
Octel Communications, a leader in the voice-mail market, last year.
</P>
<P>
   But now, many on Wall Street are expecting Lucent to mount much
larger takeovers as it tries to expand overseas and into the market
for digital data communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucent's three areas of interest are, one, data networking,
two, strong market share position and three, global presence,''
said Alkesh Shah, who follows Lucent for Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the large investment banks have been knocking on
Lucent's door recently in the hope of garnering lucrative advisory
business. In the past, the company has hired bankers from Deutsche
Bank Securities, Goldman, Sachs and Morgan Stanley. (Viqueira used
to be a takeover banker at Merrill Lynch.)
</P>
<P>
   When Lucent emerged as a public company, the big data networking
companies were largely beyond Lucent's reach, in part because their
shares traded at much higher multiples to estimated earnings,
making them potentially highly dilutive of Lucent's profits. But
Lucent's earnings multiple has caught up and is now in the mid-40s.
</P>
<P>
   One target that is rumored consistently is Ascend Communications
Inc., which makes gear for integrated voice, video and data
networks, and which has a market value of about $8.6 billion. (In
NASDAQ trading, Ascend's shares closed Friday at $46.)
</P>
<P>
   But whether Ascend wants to sell is a topic of debate. One
technology banker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, says
the company's senior management has mixed opinions about whether
they want their company to be acquired. If they do sell, the
company may ask for a price in the mid-$70s, the banker added.
</P>
<P>
   There might be one particular complication, though: If the deal
between the Ciena Corp. and Tellabs Inc. falls apart, that may open
the door for Ascend to buy Ciena instead.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Ascend's deal last last month to acquire Stratus
Computer Inc., a maker of network software, for $822 million was
seen by many in the industry as a sign that Ascend intends to go it
alone.
</P>
<P>
   The Newbridge Networks Corp. of Canada, which has seen its
shares slide badly this year, could be a way for Lucent to expand
its data networking business on the cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most intriguing possibility is that Lucent would try
to acquire the Motorola Corp. Though the troubled Motorola has more
revenue than Lucent _ about $30 billion in sales versus Lucent's
$26 billion _ Lucent has more than four times Motorola's market
value: $101 billion, compared with $25 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent is basically a nonfactor in the market for wireless
phones, an area in which Motorola is a world leader (though Lucent
does make many chips for the phones).
</P>
<P>
   Motorola would also add to Lucent's microchip business,
especially in the market for digital signal processors, which are
used to handle large amounts of digital information for a variety
of applications. Motorola's culture, however, is famously insular.
</P>
<P>
   But many analysts believe that Lucent will first look overseas,
where its presence is limited. Were Lucent to focus on the wireless
market abroad, Nokia of Finland, with a market value of $37
billion, could become a target. Were Lucent to concentrate on
traditional telephone systems, some analysts believe it could try
to buy the telecommunications business of Siemens, the German
industrial giant.
</P>
<P>
   Siemens' telecommunications operation had about $12 billion in
revenue last year and Lucent would most likely pay about twice that
to acquire the business.

 By JILL ABRAMSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ She called him ``Big Guy'' and smuggled presents
and notes to him in the Oval Office. He told her she made him feel
young and that he loved her energy and smile.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship that Monica Lewinsky described to Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr's grand jury began with furtive Oval Office
kisses and sexual encounters but deepened into something that, at
least to her, was deeply emotional. ``I never expected to fall in
love with the president,'' she testified, ``I was surprised that I
did.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has told prosecutors a different story. He
said a relationship that began as a friendship became
inappropriately intimate. ``I never should have started it,'' he
testified. He said he was deeply torn about their dealings, and
testified that after one of his encounters with Ms. Lewinsky, he
``was sick after it was over.''
</P>
<P>
   But even after a 445-page narrative that depicts their
relationship in graphic detail, Starr's report to the House sheds
little light on the central mystery at the heart of the sex and
perjury investigation that has engulfed Clinton for the last eight
months: Why would the most powerful man in the world risk such a
dangerous liaison _ conducted under the noses of Secret Service
agents and staff _ with a 22-year-old woman wearing the pink pass
of a White House intern around her neck.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship the report does depict is at once sad and
strange. Often in her own words and with amazingly detailed
recollections for dates and atmospherics, Ms. Lewinsky emerges from
these pages as being, alternately, aggressive, needy, besotted and
demanding to the point of becoming extortionate.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Ms. Lewinsky initiated the relationship in the fall
of 1995, she said, during the shutdown of the federal government
with what she called ``intense flirting.'' Their first sexual
encounter began after she gave him a glimpse of her underwear. Much
later, she wrote the president a letter threatening to disclose
their relationship and pressed him hard for help getting a job.
</P>
<P>
   But the calculating Ms. Lewinsky is offset by an insecure young
woman who worried, during her third sexual encounter with the
president, that he didn't even remember her name. She asked him
soon after whether their relationship was just ``about sex'' or
whether the president had ``some interest in trying to get to know
me as a person,'' she testified. She said she didn't even have a
substantial conversation with Clinton until their sixth encounter.
</P>
<P>
   The president emerges from the report in equally contradictory
ways. On the one hand, he was deeply torn about his behavior. Ms.
Lewinsky sensed early on that he felt it was wrong to be involved
with an intern. He broke off the relationship twice, only to resume
sex with her. Until 1997, towards the end of the relationship, he
did not let her bring him to climax, telling her, during one
encounter, they he didn't trust her enough. And, after a 1997
encounter in which Ms. Lewinsky said the president soiled her
dress, he said he felt sick afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   The accounts of their relationship given by Clinton and Ms.
Lewinsky conflict in important ways. Ms. Lewinsky said her
relationship began in November, 1995, while she was an intern and
included ten sexual encounters, eight of which occurred while she
was working at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his testimony and in a 73-page rebuttal to Starr's
report released by the White House Friday, said the relationship
began later and was less extensive. The rebuttal statement
emphasized that it was Clinton who broke off their sporadic
encounters in early 1997 ``because he knew they were wrong.''
Another supporter of the president, Rev. J. Philip Wogaman, his
pastor at Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington, has also
said that the president broke off the relationship and began
privately seeking forgiveness before it became public last January.
</P>
<P>
   The portrait of the relationship in Starr's report is based
mostly on Ms. Lewinsky's grand jury testimony, given under a grant
of immunity from prosecution. It is also based on the testimony and
tapes of Linda Tripp, Ms. Lewinsky's former friend, in whom Ms.
Lewinsky confided many details about her encounters with the
president, as well as the statements before the grand jury of other
friends and family members to whom Ms. Lewinsky spoke.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, Ms. Lewinsky confided in 11 people,
including her therapist, about her sexual encounters with the
president ``as they occurred.'' She also put together an 11-page
chart for Starr's team of prosecutors listing each encounter and
phone call from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It is also based on other evidence, such as Ms. Lewinsky's now
infamous Gap cocktail dress, which the report said is stained with
DNA material that matches the president, and with phone logs that
confirm some of Ms. Lewinsky's recollections.

PATTERN OF WOMANIZING CAUGHT UP WITH CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At first, Paula Jones said all she wanted was what
Monica S. Lewinsky received Friday: An apology from President
Clinton for making sexual advances. Rebuked and ridiculed by the
White House, Jones launched the rocket that now threatens the
Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes lost in the scandalous sexual affair between a former
White House intern and the president is the fact that Clinton's
womanizing is a recurring personal theme that has brought him to
this perilous point.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewinsky story might never have been told, and certainly
would not have produced an incriminating independent counsel
report, if she hadn't been called to testify in Jones's lawsuit
alleging Clinton sexually harassed her in a Little Rock hotel room
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see the pattern: the most powerful man in government
picks out a young woman, a low-level employee, demands oral sex,
and promises a better job,'' said John Whitehead, president of the
conservative Rutherford Institute and one of Jones's lawyers. ``The
only difference is that Jones wouldn't go along with it, and she
was ostracized.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Starr report just adds credibility to what Paula Jones was
saying all along about the president,'' Whitehead said. ``Hers is
no longer an unbelievable story.''
</P>
<P>
   Putting aside the debates about sexual harassment versus
consensual sex or the motives of his accusers, the question asked
over and over is why Bill Clinton's rich life is so littered with
allegations of extramarital affairs and unwanted sexual advances,
from Gennifer Flowers to Paula Jones, from Kathleen Willey to
Monica Lewinsky and seven other ``Jane Does'' who were deposed by
Jones's attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its shows a monumental lack of judgment,'' said Martha Burk,
president of the Center for the Advancement of Public Policy, a
feminist organization. ``His behavior is reprehensible and stupid,
and I think most women are going to be repulsed by what they read
in the Starr report.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Bernabei, a civil rights lawyer, said the circumstances of
sexual encounters alleged by Lewinsky and Jones were different, but
Clinton's behavior and attitude toward them seemed to be the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it shows is a basic disrespect for women, and that the
president feels free to approach women as sex objects rather than
professionals in the workplace,'' said Bernabei, a specialist in
sexual harassment law.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehead said that if Clinton had apologized to Jones, ``this
all would have been over before anybody ever heard of Monica
Lewinsky.'' With a political agenda of their own, Jones's attorneys
subpoenaed the former intern, who, like Clinton, allegedly lied
about the nature of the relationship under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of Clinton's womanizing dogged him long before he got
into the White House; indeed, allegations of an affair with lounge
singer Gennifer Flowers nearly sank his presidential campaign in
1992. But his friends hoped the pattern would change once he was in
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that those closest to him _ George Stephanopoulus,
Dee Dee Myers, Leon Panetta _ sat him down and told him 15 times to
stop the childish crap, that he'd get in trouble and lose the
legacy,'' said former GOP Senator Alan Simpson, now director of the
Institute of Politics at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.
``Finally, they knew they couldn't defend him, the reservoir of
good will diminished, and they left.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with allegations of wrondoing, the White House went on the
attack, demonizing Clinton's accusers. Clinton confidant James
Carville described Paula Jones, a former Arkansas state employee,
as ``trailer trash.'' In Lewinsky's case, there were suggestions
she was stalking the president.
</P>
<P>
   Former White House aide Linda R. Tripp was so outraged when
Clinton lawyer Robert Bennett called her a liar that she began
taping tell-all telephone conversations with her friend Monica
Lewinsky, and took them to Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp told Starr that Lewinsky had had an affair with the
president and had been asked by him and Washington lawyer Vernon E.
Jordan Jr. to lie about it under oath the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Starr report vindicates Paula Jones and Linda Tripp
because their only crimes were demanding that the president be
truthful and treat them fairly,'' said Claudia Barlow, a
spokeswoman for the Independent Women's Forum, a private group.
``For too long, the country's been snookered by a man who just too
easily drops his pants.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those who support the president's record and hope he stays
on the job won't defend his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't blame anybody but the president,'' Burk said. ``Oh,
you can put some of the blame on (Independent Counsel Kenneth)
Starr, you can blame Washington's extreme partisan atmosphere or a
right-wing conspiracy. But if the president had been Mr. Clean,
there wouldn't have been anything for Starr to find.''
</P>
<P>
   Burk and other feminists say the irony is that, by his
dalliances, the president who touted a female-friendly agenda has
lost his clout and credibility and made it easier for conservatives
in Congress to trample their issues, from abortion rights to pay
equity for women.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the National Organization for Women, which has been
criticized for being too kind to the president, said in reaction to
the Starr report that Clinton had ``betrayed the trust of women who
supported him. The Congress and the president have one thing in
common: Both have courted women for our votes, both have cheated on
us.''
</P>
<P>
   NOW President Patricia Ireland said she is ``frantic'' that
women who give Democrats the winning benefit of the gender gap will
sit out the November elections because they are so disgusted with
the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not disappointed in Clinton because I didn't expect a lot
better,'' said Ireland, adding that despite knowing of his
``adolescent behavior,'' Clinton was the ``better of the choices''
in 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's like the woman who takes in the poisonous snake
and nurses it back to health,'' Ireland said. ``When it bites her,
it says `You knew I was a snake when you took me in.'''

A SMALL DRUG MAKER IN A LOW-RISK NICHE

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 13)  
 (af)  
 By ANNE TERGESEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   New drugs are long shots _ some 80 percent of experimental drugs
fail before making it to market _ and so are most small drug
companies. But one seems to have found a way to put the odds in its
favor, at least for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Exploiting an opportunity that big pharmaceutical companies
largely overlooked, Sepracor Inc. of Marlborough, Mass., takes
top-selling drugs made by others and develops improved versions
with fewer side effects and more therapeutic power, a process much
safer and cheaper than developing drugs from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Though Sepracor has not yet made money, some analysts expect its
low-risk strategy to create a trickle of profits in 2000 and a
gusher by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were able to exploit a window in the pharmaceutical
industry where these concepts were not protected,'' said Douglas
Lind, senior biotechnology analyst at Morgan Stanley, who expects
the company to earn $6.45 a share in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But the strategy also has a limited life span. Giant drug
companies are mimicking Sepracor's methods in-house, and
opportunities for Sepracor to pounce on improvable but unprotected
drugs are growing scarce. So Sepracor wants to move on, using
dividends from its unique niche to become a full-scale
pharmaceutical company.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Sepracor stayed away from manufacturing its
inventions, instead licensing its patents back to the original
maker of the drug or setting up a joint venture. But now, the
company wants to make and sell its own drugs without partners.
</P>
<P>
   It is spending $7 million of its $80 million budget to develop
new drugs and is hiring a sales force, according to David P.
Southwell, the chief financial officer. The company hopes to have
one or two new compounds in clinical trials within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Once the patents on Sepracor's portfolio of 20 improved
compounds begin expiring, between 2010 and 2014, the drugs will
face competition from low-cost generic versions, a development that
Southwell said could erode sales by 90 percent. Then, Sepracor will
sink or swim according to its ability to develop new compounds from
scratch.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, said David Steinberg, managing director of Volpe
Brown Whelan, an investment bank in San Francisco, ``Sepracor has a
lot of the upside potential in terms of price appreciation of a
classic biotechnology company with not as much risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Two factors remove much of the risk: One is the high likelihood
of success when the starting point is a household name with proven
benefits, like Prozac or Claritin, two products on which the
company is working. The other is the relatively low cost of
revamping old drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Since the original drug has already been through the clinical
trial process, Sepracor can develop an improved version by spending
only three years and $30 million, on average. That compares with
the 12 to 15 years and $500 million that it takes to bring the
average new medicine to market.
</P>
<P>
   How did the company find this novel and lucrative niche?
</P>
<P>
   It all started when Timothy J. Barberich, Sepracor's founder and
chief executive, was working as a junior chemist at American
Cyanamid in the early 1970s. One night over drinks, he said, a
salesman confided that he had been run out of a South American town
when an experimental vaccine killed the mayor's prize bull.
</P>
<P>
   Although Barberich suspects that the story was apocryphal, he
said the medicine's toxicity was anything but. Like many drugs, the
vaccine existed in two versions, or isomers, chemically identical
but with mirror-image molecular structures. Only one of the twin
molecules had the desired therapeutic effect, he said, while the
other was quite harmful. Manufacturing techniques of the time
generally yielded a mixture of the two.
</P>
<P>
   By finding a way to separate good molecules from bad,
Barberich's team transformed a drug with dangerous side effects
into a safe and effective product, a process he has replicated
dozens of times since founding Sepracor in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Sepracor has also pioneered a technique in which scientists
imitate a function performed by the liver, screening out harmful
byproducts from the way a drug is metabolized by the body and
leaving behind a useful result, or metabolite, which Sepracor
patents.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the company's only commercial drug is Allegra, a
metabolite of Hoechst AG's Seldane, the popular nonsedating allergy
pill that was pulled from the market in February because of its
cardiac side effects. Sepracor developed an improved version of the
drug and licensed it back to Hoechst, which sells it as Allegra.
</P>
<P>
   Sepracor is not scheduled to receive royalties on Allegra until
2001, and then only if a patent being examined by the Food and Drug
Administration is upheld.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are more excited about three new deals Sepracor has
signed since December. Two are with Johnson &AMP; Johnson _ for
versions of the antihistamine Hismanal and the heartburn medication
Propulsid. The third is with Schering-Plough, for a version of
Claritin.
</P>
<P>
   Another boost came in July, when the FDA said Sepracor had
cleared the major hurdles of the review process for its second
product, and its first without a partner _ the asthma inhalation
solution Xopenex. It could generate $150 million in sales in 2000,
according to Morgan Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   More news is expected soon, including a possible deal for an
improved version of Prozac that preclinical studies indicate may
wash out of the body in two weeks rather than five, making the
transition to other drugs faster for those who do not respond well.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon Smith Barney expects Sepracor's revenue to reach $689
million in 2002, when Sepracor says it could have nine products on
the market.
</P>
<P>
   To keep its bills paid until it becomes profitable, Sepracor
raised $189 million through a convertible debt issue in February.
Taking on debt was a risky move for a profitless company, but the
stock has already moved above the $47-a-share conversion price,
improving the odds that holders of the bonds will convert them to
common stock, as the bond terms allow in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Because Sepracor is no longer desperate for cash, it can hold
out for better terms. In the Propulsid deal, the company negotiated
to receive royalties estimated at 10 percent to 15 percent, Lind
said, about double the rate it is expected to get on the new
version of Claritin.
</P>
<P>
   And in negotiations with Eli Lilly over a new version of Prozac,
Southwell said, ``It's fair to say we would be looking for a deal
that has a higher valuation than the Propulsid deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as stocks of most small to midsize companies are struggling
far off their recent highs, Sepracor is widely expected by analysts
to increase 35 percent from its current price of $50.25 to about
$70 by this time next year. One analyst, Peter Drake at Vector
Securities, said he thought the stock would be fairly valued at
$107 a share.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr accused the
president of repeated acts of perjury, obstruction of justice,
witness tampering and abuse of power arising from his sexual
relationship with Monica Lewinsky, in a scathing report the House
of Representatives published to the world Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The report piles fact upon fact in describing what prosecutors
say are presidential actions that violated Clinton's constitutional
duty to faithfully execute the laws, acts that they believe rise to
the standard of impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The House must now judge whether Starr has presented a
compelling case for the impeachment of the president. There is so
much material in the report, and so much contradictory testimony
from the president and his defenders, that it will take weeks to
gauge the power of the case Starr has built against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The White House angrily responded that the Starr report was an
lurid and politically motivated attempt to humiliate the president
and to overturn the will of the American people, who twice elected
Clinton to the presidency. Clinton's lawyers said that Starr and
his team of prosecutors had, after four years of unprecedented
investigative labor, found ``personal, not impeachable'' misconduct
by the president.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Starr's relentlessly accusatory 445-page report
riveted Washington and permanently changed the terms of the debate
over Clinton's fitness for office. On Friday, some members of
Congress reacted with outrage, and some with revulsion, at the
report's torrent of embarrassing details about Clinton's sexual
relationship with a woman less than half his age just outside the
Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   The House, which authorized release of the report on an
overwhelming bipartisan vote Friday afternoon, will soon begin
deliberations that could lead to the second presidential
impeachment hearings of the century.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 counts of possible impeachable offenses against Clinton
echo two of the articles of impeachment voted against President
Nixon in 1974. Nixon was found by the House Judiciary Committee to
have obstructed justice and abused the power of his office in
attempting to cover up the Watergate break-in and related offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The report contains allegations of crimes for which Clinton
could face criminal prosecution if he leaves office through
resignation or impeachment. Some prosecutors in Starr's office want
to keep the federal grand jury here in operation for another year
in order to indict him.
</P>
<P>
   The document describes in graphic detail several of Clinton's
sexual encounters with Ms. Lewinsky in areas around the Oval Office
and provides a detailed narrative of Clinton's prolonged efforts to
impede the independent counsel's inquiry and to persuade others to
assist in a conspiracy to ``hinder, impede and deflect''
investigations by a federal grand jury and the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The report provides a seamy account of an illicit relationship
between the president of the United States and an unpaid
21-year-old intern and the lengths to which he went to conceal it
from his family, his staff and the public.
</P>
<P>
   It offered a wealth of new details, from the origin of Clinton's
decision to try to thwart Starr's inquiry, in a discussion with
political adviser Dick Morris, to the FBI's determination that that
a semen stain on a blue dress belonging to Lewinsky came from the
president. The odds of the semen having come from someone other
than Clinton, the FBI reported, are 1 in 7.87 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   The report reveals that Clinton decided upon a strategy of
stonewalling the Starr investigation the same day his relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky was made public, Jan. 21. That evening, Clinton
consulted Morris, who told him that an instant poll had shown that
the American people would be willing to forgive adultery, but not
perjury or obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Morris told the president that confession of the full details of
the affair was therefore not an option. According to Morris' grand
jury testimony, the president replied, ``Well, we just have to win,
then.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a tearful confessional at a White House prayer
breakfast Friday, acknowledged that he had ``sinned'' in his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and apologized for the first time to
her and her family. But the president vowed a vigorous defense
against Starr's charges.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, in the first volley of its counterattack
against Starr and his report, issued a combative 78-page rebuttal
this afternoon even before officials had read the report.
</P>
<P>
   The response, written by David Kendall, the president's private
attorney, and White House Counsel Charles Ruff said that the
independent counsel was trying to drive the president from office
for a sexual indiscretion for which he has already apologized. The
lawyers denied that Clinton had committed any of the other crimes
alleged by the prosecutor and asserted that none of the president's
actions constituted impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers said Starr had ``dangerously overreached
to describe in the most dramatic of terms conduct that not only is
not criminal but is actually proper and lawful.''
</P>
<P>
   Their response admitted that Clinton had given incomplete and
misleading answers in a deposition in the Paula Jones lawsuit in
January and again before a federal grand jury in August. But they
denied that they constituted perjury.

STUDENTS FIND LITTLE COMFORT   IN HISTORICAL PRECEDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN McNAMARA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They voted for the first time in the presidential election of
1996, a franchise that only one of the 15 college students in this
early morning American Studies class chose not to exercise.
</P>
<P>
   About politics, they can be caustic, even jaded, but they are
more idealistic than cynical. Voting, they say, is not only a right
of passage; it's a public trust.
</P>
<P>
   The ballots of all but one of these Brandeis University
undergraduates helped reelect William Jefferson Clinton, the first
Democrat to win a second term in the White House since Franklin
Delano Roosevelt, a much revered president who died in 1945 in the
company of his mistress.
</P>
<P>
   They find no comfort in historical precedent, however. They were
not born when Grover Cleveland was reelected after he acknowledged
fathering a Buffalo widow's child out-of-wedlock, or when Dwight D.
Eisenhower, the hero-president, had an overseas dalliance with a
beautiful, young US Army aide or when the Kennedy-Camelot myth
dissolved in a mist of Mafia mistresses and Hollywood starlets.
</P>
<P>
   The scene now unfolding on Capitol Hill seems surreal to these
college students, young people close enough to Monica Lewinsky's
age to have spent recent summers employed as interns in search of
real world experience unlike anything described in Ken Starr's
report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   They are perplexed and not a little angry that one man's
reckless sexual appetite could have triggered a constitutional
crisis, that one young woman's ambitions and romantic fantasies
could have unhinged a presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But their anger is more complex than much of the commentary they
have been reading in the public prints. It reaches in almost as
many directions as Ken Starr's inquiry. While the political pundits
and the TV talking heads would have them believe that the only
choice for the country now is between impeachment and resignation,
these students are asking less dramatic, more nuanced questions.
</P>
<P>
   Is nothing private? Has our media no limits? Has our president
no self-restraint? Is sex the legal equivalent of treason? Is lying
about sex the definition of ``high crimes and misdemeanors?''
</P>
<P>
   For all their doubts, these students are not above a lurid
interest in the salacious details of President Clinton's sexual
encounters with Monica Lewinsky. But as much as they want to know
what precisely happened in that White House study, they are as
queasy as their elders about their own voyerism.
</P>
<P>
   Do we really need to know all this?
</P>
<P>
   How did we even get here from an investigation that began with
questions about a failed Arkansas land deal?
</P>
<P>
   Will it all prove to have been a game of gotcha? When the
Whitewater well ran dry, did a politically motivated prosecutor
make it his mission to keep digging until he finally tapped a
spring, any spring?
</P>
<P>
   There is ambivalence about the parameters of privacy and
prosecutorial power among these members of the MTV generation whose
curiosity first uncovered the preferred style of presidential
underwear. There is a thoughtful reluctance to rush to judgment
when so much is at stake for the nation.
</P>
<P>
   They deplore the Bible-toting hypocrisy of the cheating husband
in the White House, but they smell hypocrisy in the suggestion that
there is one, absolute moral code to which all Americans subscribe
in practice as well as theory. As appalled as they are by the
president's behavior, they recoil at least as much at the
sanctimonious tone of his political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   One day, they hear US Representative Dan Burton, the Indiana
Republican, criticizing Bill Clinton's moral laxity; the next day,
they hear him forced to admit that he fathered a child in an
extramarital affair. One day, they hear US Representative Helen
Chenoweth, the Idaho Republican, denouncing Bill Clinton for
lowering ``himself to this sordid spectacle;'' the next day they
hear her forced to acknowledge that she engaged in a six-year
sexual relationship with a married man.
</P>
<P>
   For good or ill, we live in a time of moral relativism, of
situational ethics. Murray Kempton, the late, great New York
newspaperman, described ours as ``the age of the plea bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   William Jefferson Clinton is a man of his times. In a nation of
political trimmers and rationalizers, he is not the first to parse
his words in search not of the truth but of the ``legally
accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   In one classroom, on one campus, 15 voters are weighing the
evidence, deciding how to measure a president against his times and
his ideals when the gap between them is so wide.

COLUMBUS RICH IN CARIBBEAN TALENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM, Mass. _ Ohio seems an unlikely place for Major League
Soccer's Caribbean Connection. But the Columbus Crew have gathered
one of the most productive crops of young talent in the league, a
tribute to astute scouting and economic sense.
</P>
<P>
   The Crew, who will meet the Revolution in the second game of a
doubleheader Saturday night at Foxboro Stadium, following the US
Women's Cup opener between Mexico and the United States, feature:
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; _Jeff Cunningham, 22, who has scored eight goals despite not
being a regular starter.
</P>
<P>
   _Ansil Elcock, 27, a speedy defender and cousin of ...
</P>
<P>
   _Stern John, 20, the league's leading goal scorer with 20.
</P>
<P>
   _Andy Williams, 20, who joined the team after the World Cup and
set a league record with assists in seven successive matches.
</P>
<P>
   The value for money is exceptional. Their total salary is less
than $175,000, or about one-10th the salary cap of an MLS team.
Bargains like that raise questions about why the league would
search elsewhere for players.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the most cost-effective Caribbean performer in MLS has
been John, potentially the successor to Dwight Yorke as Trinidad
and Tobago's leading striker. John is earning less than $40,000 but
will likely receive offers from European clubs seeking another
Yorke, who was recently transferred from Aston Villa to Manchester
United for $20.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the most important Columbus acquisition might be Williams,
who, like John, failed a Revolution tryout. Williams was projected
as a $1 million player by Jamaica national team coach Rene Simoes,
but MLS is paying him less than 10 percent of that this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Williams) is a special kind of player with tremendous
individual ability,'' Columbus coach Tom Fitzgerald said Friday.
``He is deceptively fast and quick and he has the kind of flair you
look for in a midfielder. He is still learning how to play with us
and we are still learning how to play with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our responsibility as coaches is to develop a team that can
compete and fits the salary cap. The big knock on Caribbean players
is that they have individual flair and skill but they are not
organized. We've tried to show them how to be part of a successful
team and not just successful individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to find players who would complement each other,
find a chemistry to be a championship team. We have a blend of
experience and youth. It's a nice mix and it's fun to watch us
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbus hopes to clinch second place and the home-field
advantage in the Eastern Conference playoffs. The Revolution trail
Miami by 6 points for the fourth and final playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   But the Crew could be confronting problems soon. John, who had
an offer from Motherwell in Scotland but lacked a work visa, will
be tempted to depart. If Williams continues to excel, he could be
in a similar position. And if they remain in MLS, will the Midwest
provide the right venue for them?
</P>
<P>
   ``I played against a lot of Caribbean players when I was in
Tampa,'' Fitzgerald said. ``They have a laid-back attitude, which I
like, but when it's time to play, there is not a lot that distracts
them. They come to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Columbus has the advantages of a big city, yet it's a small
city. You don't have the rush-rush-rush of Los Angeles, New York,
Dallas. It's more laid back, and they can relate to it. When the
league started, Columbus was last on the list of a lot of players,
but now it's jumped up quite a ways.''

ACHY KNEES SLOW, CAN'T STOP RANGERS' McLEMORE 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ No day passes, second baseman Mark
McLemore says, without the 33-year-old infielder contemplating his
value to the Rangers during their pursuit of an American League
West title.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing I want to do is hurt this ballclub and hurt its
chances of winning,'' McLemore said.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore cannot play at 100 percent; his knees will not allow
it.
</P>
<P>
   Those knees remain the source of McLemore's daily frustration
and are the reason of his day-to-day status. McLemore's condition
is more uncertain this weekend during the Rangers' three-game
series with the Devil Rays at Tropicana Field, which has artificial
turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even thinking about it,'' said McLemore, who in
September 1997 had arthroscopic surgery on both knees. ``I'm just
going to go out and play. It's a test every day, but I'm planning
on playing every day. Thursday was my last day off unless the
manager decides otherwise. That's my train of thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Tropicana Field offers McLemore one advantage: a dirt infield.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule, though, offers one disadvantage: a day game
scheduled for tomorrow after tonight's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's not ready to go, we've got more than an adequate
replacement who has done well for us all year,'' Rangers manager
Johnny Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are fortunate that a player the quality of Luis
Alicea can replace McLemore in the lineup, but there's a reason
McLemore is a starter.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore's batting average hovers in the mid-.260s, but his
on-base percentage _ .384 before the game last night _ makes him an
offensive catalyst batting first or second.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore demonstrated that in the Rangers' 7-6 victory Tuesday
against the Royals at The Ballpark in Arlington. The Rangers began
the bottom of the ninth inning trailing 6-4, with Royals closer
Jeff Montgomery on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery threw strikes with his first two pitches, but
McLemore worked the count for a leadoff walk to set the stage for
an improbable victory.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore's 80 walks ranked eighth among AL players before games
yesterday, and his .371 batting average with runners in scoring
position ranked second.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that there are still things I can do to help
this team win,'' McLemore said.
</P>
<P>
   How often McLemore can do those things depends on those sore
knees.

2 ROADS TO FINAL: HINGIS RALLIES, DAVENPORT BREEZES

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Martina Hingis does not monopolize women's tennis at
17 the way she did so merrily at 16, but Friday she proved she
still has the gumption to grab the game by the jugular. Unlike
Venus Williams, who fell a rung short of turning the U.S. Open
women's finale into a deja vu showdown, Hingis took control of her
semifinal match at crunch time.
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time in her slow-blooming career, so did
Lindsay Davenport. The 22-year-old Californian was both ecstatic
and relieved about reaching her first Grand Slam final after
enduring years of unkind predictions that said she was destined to
become a has-been before she had ever been.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever said when I was growing up that I was ever going
to be any good or get to a Grand Slam final; in my teens I wasn't
expected to do anything,'' Davenport said after a 6-4, 6-4
demolition of the talented 18-year-old Williams sent her into the
final against Hingis, who leads their rivalry, 6-5, but has
surrendered two of their last three meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've proven a lot of people wrong. I'm not the most
unbelievable athlete, I'm not anything, I just tried hard to get
where I'm at,'' said Davenport, whose crackling cross-court
backhands were in vicious working order throughout the 72-minute
rout that improved her career record against her more celebrated
fellow 6-footer to 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   Just after Hingis recalibrated her passes and volleys after a
wobbly start and knocked her doubles partner, Jana Novotna, out of
singles contention on the balmy but breezy Arthur Ashe Stadium,
3-6, 6-1, 6-4, the second-ranked Davenport took center stage
against Williams, last year's breakthrough finalist, and banged the
beaded wonder into quick submission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never a prodigy; I think I've just maximized everything
I have,'' said Davenport, who drew incentive to excel on her
favorite hardcourt surface. Davenport said she hoped to celebrate
the birthday Saturday of her mother and housemate, Ann, by
contributing a Grand Slam trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, wearing the sixth of seven racy dresses Reebok
designed for her reprise run at an Open championship, was a vision
in persimmon red, but when her shots, and her first serve in
particular, failed to match the audacity of her cut-out costume,
Davenport calmly capitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Williams expressed regret that she would have no opportunity to
unveil her seventh and final outfit of this Open run, a patriotic
red-white-and-blue concoction diligently accessorized by matching
beads and fingernails. ``I'm actually going to put that in a coffin
and bury it,'' said Williams, who acknowledged Davenport as the
leading power broker in their sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's one of the more powerful players on the tour; she's
stepping her game up before it's too late,'' Williams said about
Davenport, with whom she has a chilly relationship. ``You don't
want to be 25 or 26 before you start reaching your best; you want
it now.''
</P>
<P>
   The immediate stakes were double or nothing for the top-seeded
Hingis at the Open, the Grand Slam that demands Herculean
performances from those mortals who strive to survive it with their
laurels intact. And Hingis does like her laurels. With her 1997
Open title defense and her No. 1 ranking on the line, Hingis made
the nimblest of escapes from a 4-1 third-set deficit against
Novotna, this year's Wimbledon champion, and arrived in the final
right on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I was always taught or raised that way, that I always
have pressure on myself and the harder the better,'' Hingis said of
her determination to avenge her semifinal loss to Novotna at
Wimbledon and her bid to salvage her 1998 Grand Slam campaign by
retaining her Open championship. Hingis won three of the year's
four Grand Slams in 1997, but has settled so far for successfully
defending her Australian Open title in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Novotna's collapse was reminiscent of her harrowing 1993
meltdown in her Wimbledon final against Steffi Graf. The
29-year-old Czech veteran led that match, 4-1, in the third set as
well and after it wound up watering the shoulder of Wimbledon's
royal hostess, the Duchess of Kent, with her tears.
</P>
<P>
   But Novotna, who maintains that her acquisition of a Grand Slam
title at long last at Wimbledon earlier this summer has freed her
to compete with a clear conscience, kept her tears to herself after
marring her encounter with Hingis with 50 unforced errors Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Martina, you never really feel in control because she's
such a talented player, such a great player, and she can suddenly
change from one game into another,'' Novotna said. ``I felt like I
was really ready, I had the strength and the game, but to beat the
No. 1 player and defending champion is never easy. Martina started
to play completely different tennis in the second set, just started
to come in all the time and play a perfect serve-and-volley game.
In the third, I was up, 4-1, and from that point on, I started to
miss too many approach shots, too many volleys, and you simply
can't do that against Martina.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving like a mobile backboard, and all the more unnerving for
the sure-fire smile she pasted on her face no matter what the
scoreboard said, Hingis mounted a comeback that defied a lost first
set for the seventh time of her Grand Slam career. Now 5-0 against
Novotna whenever their clashes stretch to a third set, Hingis
appeared undaunted by her 4-1 deficit in the final set. After
sneaking back into the set courtesy of Novotna's errors, Hingis
held for 5-4 with a pass too crisp for Novotna to counter. Hingis
stayed ruthless, and after blowing one match point with a backhand
lob that landed just long, she broke Novotna for the match when the
Czech netted a nervous forehand on the second match point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Martina loses when she's overpowered,'' Davenport
said, ``and that's what I'm going to try and do.''

   PHOENIX - Where was the outrage?
</P>
<P>
   It took awhile for it to develop on Phoenix area radio as the
Kenneth Starr report was revealed during the noon hour and later on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Only when Bob Mohan took the air shortly after 5 p.m. on KFYI-AM
(910) did the anger begin to flow. He warned listeners about his
language, then proceeded to call Clinton ``a lying, devious
bastard.'' He added that he thinks ``the Clintons are evil _ evil
to the bone.'' He called on Congress to show ``testicular
fortitude'' in impeaching Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But oddly, it was the first time all day that a KFYI personality
talked specifically about the report, although it featured regular
reports from CBS News.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, KFYI broadcast its regularly scheduled Rush
Limbaugh and Laura Schlessinger shows _ both on tape delay.
Limbaugh talked about the scandal but did not have the report;
Schlessinger did not even mention it.
</P>
<P>
   At KTAR-AM (620), meanwhile, the Starr report dominated the day.
It had a monopoly on local coverage throughout the early afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Grant Woods used his regular Friday slot to
read much of the report and handle switches to ABC News reports.
His two hours featured few calls because the run of news was so
heavy.
</P>
<P>
   Woods expressed surprise that the Starr report contained nothing
on the original focus of his inquiry, the Whitewater real estate
deal, or any of the other scandals that have plagued the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Program director Laurie Parsons said the station hoped to use
``good taste and decorum'' in reporting the details of the Starr
report. But Woods held nothing back, reading from the report
verbatim several times.
</P>
<P>
   He also consistently pointed out KTAR's advantage in covering
the stories as the Limbaugh program lagged behind.
</P>
<P>
   Of the few calls Woods took, callers seemed more sad than mad.
Woods himself, calling the story ``one of the biggest stories of
our time,'' maintained a solemn tone _ at least until he became a
guest on Ted Simons' show at 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, he made a joke about one of the allegations in the
Starr report. ``I don't want to give any impetus to cigar sales,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   At 4 p.m., KTAR featured an hourlong report from ABC News. The
station moved Arizona Diamondbacks baseball to its sister station,
KMVP-AM (860). Between 5 and 7 p.m. it ran its usual afternoon news
_ heavy on the Starr report _ and followed that with a local
special featuring Michael Dixon and Charles Goyette.
</P>
<P>
   KFYI also featured a special report in the midst of the Mohan
shows, then took angry calls the rest of the evening. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's lawyers argued Friday that
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's impeachment referral to
Congress was sprinkled with salacious and lurid details solely to
humiliate the president and drive him from office.
</P>
<P>
   In their 78-page response, couched in tones that are both
conversational and combative, the Clinton lawyers sought to portray
the president's behavior as a major personal failing for which he
has accepted responsibility but nothing serious enough to warrant
his impeachment and removal from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In comments to reporters Friday afternoon, David Kendall, the
president's personal lawyer, pressed the notion that Clinton's
sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky ``was not a new story''
but rather fit an age-old human pattern of illicit sex and
understandable efforts by both partners to conceal it from the rest
of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``In short this is personal, not impeachable,'' Kendall told
reporters gathered in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. The
report emphasized that the president has admitted that his sexual
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky was a serious error, but that,
``This private mistake does not amount to an impeachable action.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of what amounted to the first draft of the
president's defense brief before Congress and the nation is the
argument that impeachment should be reserved for the gravest of
crimes and that Starr has inflated Clinton's offenses to satisfy
his own political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   In the report, which was prepared even before the Clinton
lawyers were able to see Starr's 445-page referral to the House of
Representatives, the Clinton lawyers reached back into the history
of the Republic to argue that utilizing the Constitution's
impeachment clause was a wholly disproportionate response to the
president's misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton lawyers argued that the nation's founders believed _
and contemporary scholars agree _ that impeachment was designed as
the most serious form of sanction to be used only for ``the most
serious forms of wrongdoing.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also sought to dispute charges made by Starr that the
president committed perjury, tried to obstruct justice, tampered
with witnesses or abused the powers of his office in trying to
bolster his deception that he had not had an intimate relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   And in one section of the report rendered with anger, the
Clinton lawyers asked rhetorically: ``Where's Whitewater?''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers said that as evidence of Starr's motives he has not
formally exonerated the president or Mrs. Clinton even though the
prosecutor apparently has been unable to find any evidence of their
wrongdoing in the Whitewater land deal in Arkansas that was the
original issue to be investigated. The report also said that Starr
was evidently unable to come up with anything improper involving
the Clintons' behavior in his investigations of other matters,
including the dismissal of longtime employees at the White House
travel office and the acquisition by the White House of
investigative files of more than 900 people, some of them prominent
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means that the Office of Independent Counsel report is
left with nothing but the details of a private sexual relationship
told in graphic details with the intent to embarrass,'' the Clinton
lawyers argued.
</P>
<P>
   But the complexities of trying to knit the legal and political
strands of the president's case were evident in his lawyers'
exquisitely nuanced arguments as to why Clinton was not guilty of
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been expressing contrition on almost a daily basis
for the last few weeks, insisting that he has thoroughly come to
terms with his actions. At the same time, he continues to insist
that he was truthful when he told lawyers for Paula Jones that he
had not engaged in sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky. To do
otherwise could lend credence to a perjury charge, Clinton's
advisers have said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr devoted considerable portions of his report developing the
argument that Clinton committed perjury by lying in his Jan. 17,
1998, deposition to lawyers for Mrs. Jones who were trying to show
that Clinton had a pattern of engaging in sexually irresponsible
behavior. In response to a question, Clinton testified that he had
not engaged in sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In their extended explanation, Clinton's lawyers argued that his
answers were truthful because he did not engage in traditional
sexual intercourse. At the time of the Jones deposition, the trial
judge had approved a specific definition of sexual relations and
Clinton has asserted that he believed the definition covered
traditional intercourse but not, for example, oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president testified truthfully,'' Kendall said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, a statement must be false to lead to a perjury
charge. But a misleading answer may not constitute perjury.
</P>
<P>
   The argument advanced by Kendall and Charles F.C. Ruff, the
White House counsel and co-author of Friday's report, is that the
lawyers for Mrs. Jones did not press Clinton to answer further
questions.
</P>
<P>
   During the deposition, Clinton said he agreed with an affidavit
of Ms. Lewinsky asserting they had never engaged in a sexual
relationship. ``To the president, that term reasonably requires
sexual intercourse as a necessary component of the relationship,''
the Clinton report said. ``Since his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky
did not involve intercourse, he truthfully answered that the
affadavit was accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the lawyers argued that Clinton accurately denied
having a ``sexual affair'' with Ms. Lewinsky because he understood
that term to require traditional sexual intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall told reporters that the allegations about the details of
the sexual relationship were included in the Starr report for
political purposes only. ``The salacious allegations in this
referral are simply designed to humiliate, embarrass and
politically damage the president,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Starr's lawyers argued they were obliged to include so many
details about the actual sexual activities because Clinton
interpreted the definition of ``sexual relations'' in such a narrow
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Friday whether Clinton had invited the inclusion of those
details with that definition, Kendall repeated that Clinton had
answered all questions accurately, if not completely. The
inclusions of descriptions of specific sex acts, he said, ``exceeds
any legitimate justification.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall also laid the foundation for Clinton's defense against
obstruction of justice charges, denying that Clinton had urged
anyone to lie, but acknowledging that ``in all such wrongful,
improper relations there is concomitant concealment, by its very
nature.''
</P>
<P>
   In their rebuttal, Clinton's lawyers underlined that Starr
failed to show that Clinton or anyone in the White House helped
write the so-called ``talking points.'' Ms. Lewinsky testified that
she wrote these talking points on her own and gave them to her
onetime friend Linda Tripp, to alter Ms. Tripp's account of
Clinton's encounter with another woman in a way that would not hurt
the president.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton lawyers noted that the talking points were widely
described in press accounts as the linchpin of the Starr
investigation and, in fact, were used by Starr as a justification
for investigating the Lewinsky matter because they raised issues of
suborning perjury.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton report said of the talking points, ``in the fullness
of time, and after investigation, they have vanished entirely. Only
the stigma remains.''

A FUND MANAGER IN KANSAS KEEPS HIS EYE ON EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Kan.)   (ART ADV: Graphic facts on United International Growth fund is

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 13)  
 (af)  
 By LAWRENCE STRAUSS 
  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Managing money for Waddell &AMP; Reed Investment Management in the
rolling hills of Overland Park, Kan., Thomas A. Mengel is a long
way from his European roots. Born in West Germany, he spent many of
his school years in Milan, and he speaks four languages. And though
he says he enjoys the ``very livable'' quality of life near Kansas
City, he acknowledges missing Italy's Renaissance architecture as
well as his relatives and friends on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   But Mengel, 41, has a place for Europe in his portfolio as well
as his heart. His stock-picking over the last two years has had a
strong European bent, allowing him to take advantage of formidable
European market gains as he avoided disastrous selloffs in Asia and
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   His fund, United International Growth, with $1.19 billion in
assets, is now about 75 percent invested in Europe, mostly in mid-
and large-capitalization stocks. Since he began managing the
portfolio in May 1996, it has returned 18.3 percent annually, on
average, through Sept. 4, compared with just 3.8 percent for the
average foreign stock fund, according to Morningstar Inc., the
Chicago financial publisher.
</P>
<P>
   (The $81.8 million Waddell &AMP; Reed International Growth fund,
also run by Mengel, has a similar percentage in European stocks,
but it includes many smaller-cap issues. Since he became manager in
May 1996, the fund has returned 22.3 percent annualized through
Sept. 4.)
</P>
<P>
   Mengel's stock-picking is best described as eclectic. He
combines attributes of growth and value investing in what is often
called a ``growth at a reasonable price'' orientation.
</P>
<P>
   While he crunches financial data on individual companies and
insists on meeting face to face with their management, Mengel keeps
an eye on macroeconomic developments, too.
</P>
<P>
   That is what prompted him to flee Asia last year, escaping much
of the carnage those markets have inflicted on international funds.
Among the sell signals were a commercial real estate glut in
Thailand, overcapacity in the Indonesian cement industry and a
regionwide increase in nonperforming loans. He began trimming the
holdings at the beginning of the second quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very concerned,'' Mengel said. ``Maybe we didn't see
the full magnitude, but we were concerned about overpriced
assets,'' like real estate in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   From an 11 percent position in Asian stocks, excluding Japan, at
the start of 1997, the fund had eliminated its exposure by the end
of October.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Mengel is still cautious about Asia. ``We feel the
balance sheets are still deteriorating, and there's a shortage of
cash,'' he said. ``The red light is blinking.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Mengel believes strongly that Europe is moving in
the right direction economically.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies there are reorganizing, an encouraging trend to
him. And he is pleased that stock buybacks, common in the United
States, are beginning to get legislative approval in some parts of
Europe, including Germany and France.
</P>
<P>
   And he surmises that the new European currency will be a major
catalyst for further economic changes. ``I think it brings more
competition to all of these companies,'' he said. As such, some
will win big, and some will lose big: fertile territory for a good
stock-picker.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, though, he has unloaded several European
banking stocks, including Credit Suisse Group, because of its
exposure to the Russian economic crisis. He has raised the
portfolio's cash position to 25 percent of assets, from 17 percent
in mid-summer.
</P>
<P>
   In looking for stocks, Mengel visits about 100 companies a year,
always talking to management. If he likes what he sees and hears,
he said, ``we want to see their record, how they've done it.''
Among the questions he ponders: How dominant is the product? Can
the company take the product into new markets? Does its finances
allow it to do so?
</P>
<P>
   He also tries to discern a product's margins, its strategic
position and, he said, ``the environment these guys are in.''
</P>
<P>
   One example is Marschollek Lautenschlager &AMP; Partner, a German
financial services company that Mengel considers an emerging
powerhouse. The company aims at young professionals, offering
financial planning, mutual funds and banking services.
</P>
<P>
   By talking to company managers, he found that nearly half of all
German medical school graduates were customers. Not content with
that, he also talked to a dozen customers to gauge their
satisfaction with the company's services.
</P>
<P>
   The average age of its clients is just 35, Mengel said, and the
opportunity for geographic expansion is alluring. ``The potential
is enormous,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mengel bought the stock in 1996 at 160 marks. It closed at 890
marks on Friday and he said it could grow 30 percent over the next
12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Mengel also likes Telepizza of Spain, which is in the pizza home
delivery business, a relatively new phenomenon in Spain. The
company, whose stock accounts for 1.2 percent of the fund's assets,
controls 50 percent of the Spanish pizza market and has plans to
expand into other countries.
</P>
<P>
   He bought the stock at around 1,500 pesetas in June. It closed
at 1,230 pesetas on Friday, but he thinks the stock price should
rise 30 percent over the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Another major holding is a British company, Colt Telecom Group.
The company, which accounts for 1 percent of the fund's assets, is
building local fiber optic networks in financial centers like
Paris, Milan, Zurich and Frankfurt _ and focusing on big companies
as customers.
</P>
<P>
   He began buying shares of Colt in late April at 320 pence; the
stock closed on Friday at 602.5 pence. He said it could rise an
additional 25 percent over the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Mengel also sees investment opportunities in France, where he
contends that many equities are relatively cheap. ``While the
country is a little behind the curve in terms of restructuring,
they are catching up rapidly,'' he said. ``Some of the companies
are extremely well-positioned.''
</P>
<P>
   He bought shares in Alcatel Alsthom, a French conglomerate, in
January at 770 francs. The stock closed on Friday at 993 francs,
and Mengel said it could appreciate 40 percent in the next two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Wolper, international fund editor at Morningstar Mutual
Funds, said Mengel had displayed superb timing in his stock-picking
and timing, although he was quick to add that future success is by
no means assured. ``However, in his case I do think he deserves a
lot of credit,'' he said. ``He is picking individual companies in
Europe, and he's done a good job with that.''

<P>
   Kelly Green and Karri Carter spent a night late last month in
McLean County Jail in Bloomington, Ill. Both were sales clerks from
the nearby Wal-Mart, arrested in the store and charged with ringing
up sales to phantom customers, recording bogus returns and then
pocketing cash refunds of more than $300.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Green, 31, and Ms. Carter, 27, who are scheduled to be
arraigned this week, declined to discuss the case; Bryan Holmberg,
a spokesman for Wal-Mart Stores, would say only that ``this kind of
incident is very rare.'' But if they are convicted, the women will
become another statistic in a rising tide of employee theft in
retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few disadvantages of a robust economy, human resource
administrators say, is its effect on hiring practices, especially
among retailers. The nation's unemployment rate has held at well
below 5 percent this year; in some states, like Minnesota and New
Hampshire, it is skirting 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The shrinking labor pool, consultants say, gives employers fewer
hiring choices, exacerbating other changes in employment patterns
that have contributed to worker theft in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The employment base is low, and retailers are not getting a
lot of people who are extremely qualified,'' said David Johnston,
director of training and research for LP Innovations, the
loss-prevention subsidiary of J. Baker Inc., a Canton, Mass.,
retailer that owns the Casual Male Big and Tall clothing chain.
``If the company doesn't have an effective screening program,
they're going to get whoever comes in off the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Retailers reported a surge in employee theft last year,
according to the latest National Retail Security Survey by the
University of Florida. The companies in the survey attributed 47
percent of all lost cash and merchandise to the light fingers of
their workers, up from 41 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never seen employee-theft numbers quite this high,''
said Richard Hollinger, a sociology professor at the university.
The survey, now in its eighth year, polled 201 retailers
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   If the survey results are accurate for the industry as a whole,
workers stole $13.3 billion of the $28.1 billion in cash and
merchandise that retailers lost last year. By comparison,
shoplifting _ which gets far more publicity as a source of retail
crime _ accounted for only $9.6 billion, or 34 percent. The
remainder was lost to vendor fraud and administrative error.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with theft problems, more retailers are running employee
background checks through organizations like the United States
Mutual Association, a clearinghouse on theft and fraud cases. Much
of the information it collects about employee theft and shoplifters
is provided by the retailers themselves, to be shared with other
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Ralicki, vice president of marketing for United States
Mutual, which counts Sears, Roebuck and Gap Inc. among its
subscribing companies, said it had 2.5 million cases of employee
theft in its data base. That number, he said, should double within
two years as more retailers contribute information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retailers have limited resources they can devote to background
checks for entry-level personnel,'' he said, ``but they want to
know if John or Jane Doe has a track record of dishonesty before
they give them access to their cash and merchandise.''
</P>
<P>
   Retailers are also spending millions of dollars a year on new
technology to combat employee theft, a category of spending that
barely existed a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Among the fast-selling items are cash register software programs
that track unusual transactions, like a high number of voided sales
or several returns to one credit card. When the software senses
trickery, a nearby closed-circuit camera focuses on the employee.
</P>
<P>
   The Sensormatic Electronics Corp. of Boca Raton, Fla., said that
new orders for employee-surveillance technology soared 17 percent
last year and have more than doubled over the last five years; by
comparison, Sensormatic said, its shoplifting technology sales have
grown just 25 percent over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing more business from small and midsize retailers
because the technology is more affordable and they can't afford not
to use it,'' said Donald R. Taylor, director of market planning for
Sensormatic.
</P>
<P>
   Surveillance equipment for a small store can cost $5,000 to
$10,000 _ and the investment may well pay off. According to the
University of Florida study, an employee who steals will take an
average of $1,058 in cash or merchandise in a year, while a
shoplifter will walk away with an average of $212.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the smaller pool of available labor, other changes in
employment patterns are contributing to the rise in employee theft,
retail security consultants say. Retailers that stay open later or
operate seven days a week, for example, tend to rely more on
part-time employees, who may lack a strong sense of loyalty to the
company.
</P>
<P>
   High turnover, another abettor to theft, also dogs the industry,
because an entry-level retail job is no longer seen as a first step
on a career path. And working conditions at retail jobs can also
lead to a discontented work force. Security experts say that
employees caught stealing often said they felt unfairly treated,
overworked or underpaid.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Kasserman, a loss-prevention officer at the Bi-Mart Corp.,
a discount chain based in Eugene, Ore., has his own explanation for
this kind of thinking. ``If you pay someone $6.50 an hour to stand
on their feet,'' he said, and to take whatever insults the public
dishes out for seven to nine hours a day, ``they get mad, and
eventually they'll take it out by stealing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jealousy may also be a motivation, especially in the era of
executive stock options. ``Whenever you have a chief executive
officer who makes millions,'' Kasserman said, ``the lowest ranks of
employees will always feel the need to play Robin Hood _ with the
exception that they never return any of the goods or money.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON - Official Washington ground to a near halt Friday as
members of Congress went home for the weekend, leaving their
employees to pore over the nearly 500 pages of titillating detail
supplied by Kenneth Starr's epic impeachment report.
</P>
<P>
   And what eye-popping, bodice-ripping reading it was, with its
lurid descriptions of licentious liaisons between the world's most
powerful leader and the minx he dared to dally with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe I'm reading it,'' said a 24-year-old female
press secretary. ``I can't STOP reading it. I think my mom would
die if she knew I was reading this.''
</P>
<P>
   Staffers were simultaneously revolted and riveted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing to think our president behaved like this in a
federal building, in the workplace, with an employee. It's
disgusting,'' said one female chief of staff. She turned to another
staff member: ``You're going to have to brief the boss on this. I
can't. I'd be embarrassed to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   A communications director on the Senate side said the report is
consuming everything at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like watching The Weather Channel in a hurricane. You
knew a big storm was coming, but you didn't know exactly when or
where,'' he said. ``It's a non-stop media melee out there.''
</P>
<P>
   On the House side, a male staff director said, ``Eighty percent
of all other action has ended. It's an event unlike any I've
witnessed. It's unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
   Another female chief of staff was so turned off by the talk on
television that she tuned out. CNN provided gripping earfuls of the
report, so the administrative aide flipped on the cartoon channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't want to hear it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another staffer noticed the dates of the assignations. They
began in November 1995, when the federal government was shut down
in a legislative impasse between the president and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   What is it they say about idle hands and the devil?
</P>
<P>
   ``That DOG was doing all this while the government was shut
down,'' the staff exclaimed. ``That DOG!''
</P>
<P>
   When finally pressed, and humor aside, the politically savvy,
the jaded campaign and legislative warriors who've seen it all were
as stunned as they expect the nation to be at the tales of the
president's trysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of shocking to see in print,'' the Sente
communications director said. ``Not to be Pollyanna-ish, but it's
so depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation has been hearing about the president's pot smoking,
war-avoidance and sexual encounters for years, with continued good
ratings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that stuff people said didn't matter, finally does.'' &QL;

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ TCU sophomore center Shane Ladewig speaks of
last season as if it were a lifetime ago.
</P>
<P>
   And for the four Horned Frogs' offensive linemen who saw their
first collegiate action in 1997, it might as well have been.
</P>
<P>
   Their maturing process took a giant leap forward in last week's
season opener at Iowa State. The mammoth holes created by the
offensive unit helped the Frogs to a 31-21 victory, with TCU
scoring 17 unanswered points in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems mentally that we are an entirely different unit,''
said Ladewig, who is 6-foot-3, 293 pounds. ``You could tell that by
how we kept our composure, how we fought to get ahead and then once
we got ahead we still kept pressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't satisfied with just whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   This massive bunch, composed of four sophomores and one senior,
covets respectability and dependability this season. They can take
a huge step toward that goal when TCU opens its home season against
the gambling ``46'' defense of the Oklahoma Sooners at 6:05 tonight
at Amon Carter Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   TCU is led up front by redshirt sophomores Michael Keathley
(tackle), Jeff Millican (guard) and Ladewig, along with senior
tackle Russ Sanders and sophomore guard Robert Wallace, who saw
playing time last season as a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners opened the season last week with four sacks in a
37-9 victory against North Texas. Oklahoma limited the Eagles to 64
rushing yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``OU's defensive front is exceptionally talented and athletic,''
TCU offensive line coach Jim Bob Helduser said. ``They have very
good players and a solid scheme. This is certainly a big challenge
for us as an offensive-line unit.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is a challenge the Frogs' front group say they are ready
for. They point to 297 yards rushing last week vs. the Cyclones,
including three consecutive long scoring drives in the final
quarter and a half. And while there seems to be few parallels
between the Sooners' defensive front and that of Iowa State,
Ladewig does see one common denominator. The chance for another
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're big up front. All of them are big,'' Ladewig said.
``And they play kind of cocky since they are OU. They're also very
quick, but they can be beat.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU tailback Basil Mitchell is certainly a believer. The holes
helped him rush for 186 yards last week and three touchdowns. The
Frogs averaged 5.9 yards per offensive play behind a group that
averages 6-foot-4 and 296.6 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those boys are so real up there,'' Mitchell said. ``The
biggest difference between them this year and last just seems to be
confidence. They think they can go out there and block anybody. I
don't know if that was always the case last year.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the starting five, the Frogs also have some
depth, with the return this week of senior Greg Davis after a
one-year suspension. And redshirt freshman Victor Payne had been
impressive enough during spring drills to earn a starting guard
spot, but a turf-toe injury slowed his progress over the past
month. Sophomore tackle David Bobo also adds depth, though he will
likely miss today's game after reinjuring his hamstring against
Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest problems last year for many of us had to do
with it being the first time we were suiting up for a game, and
that makes a difference,'' said Millican, who is 6-6 and 300
pounds. ``The benefit now is everyone has experience, including a
lot of the guys on the second team.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is what lets us know our experience on the field is going
to be a lot better this time around.''

 WASHINGTON: constituted perjury.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Starr report's strongest sections describe exhaustively the
sexual activity between Ms. Lewinsky and Clinton and Clinton's
repeated misrepresentations about it under oath. The document's
authors said Clinton's evasiveness before the federal grand jury
forced them to include the salacious details about the sexual
encounters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first two possible grounds for impeachment concern the
president's lying under oath about the nature of his relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky,'' the report stated. ``The details associated
with those grounds are, by their nature, explicit. The president's
testimony unfortunately has rendered the details essential with
respect to those two grounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors gave great weight to Ms. Lewinsky's accounts of her
sexual activities with the president. While the president has
admitted engaging in some forms of sexual conduct, he specifically
denied other forms. It was those statements that are the basis of
allegations of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors gave great weight to Ms. Lewinsky's accounts of her
sexual activities with the president. While the president has
admitted engaging in some forms of sexual conduct, he specifically
denied other forms. It was those statements that are the basis of
allegations of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   In their response, Clinton's lawyers said that answers to
ambiguous questions can never be perjury. And, they said, ``nobody
can be convicted of perjury based on only one other person's
testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors wrote that Ms. Lewinsky's account was
corroborated by contemporaneous discussions she had with 11 people,
including eight friends, two psychological counselors and her
mother, Marcia Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Sections alleging abuse of power and witness tampering appear
less conclusive. The single accusation of witness tampering arose
from discussions Clinton had with his personal secretary, Betty
Currie, immediately after his deposition in the Paula Jones
lawsuit. Prosecutors believe that Clinton tried to influence her
testimony with a series of leading questions, but Mrs. Currie's
testimony on several key points was ambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   The Starr report also accused the president of abusing his
office by lying repeatedly to the public and in court proceedings.
The charge also includes the president's repeated refusal to
voluntarily testify before the grand jury and his invocation of
executive privilege to block testimony by key aides. Clinton
ultimately testified after he was subpoenaed and the president's
privilege claims were denied by federal judges.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers rejected that argument, saying ``If
allowing aides to repeat misleading statements is a crime, then any
number of public officials are guilty of misusing their office for
as long as they fail to admit wrongdoing in response to any
allegation about their activity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Starr report cited 11 specific possible grounds for
impeachment in four categories: Five counts of lying under oath,
four counts of obstruction of justice, one count of witness
tampering and one count of abuse of constitutional authority.
</P>
<P>
   The report, written by several assistants in Starr's office, is
methodical and exhaustive. When confronted by conflicting accounts,
however, they tend to accept the version most damaging to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``After being subpoenaed in July,'' the report says in one
summary passage describing what it called a pattern of perjury by
Clinton, ``the president made false statements to the grand jury on
Aug. 17, 1998. That night, the president again made false
statements to the American people and Congress, contending that his
answers in his civil deposition had been `legally accurate.' The
president then made an implicit plea for Congress to take no
action: `Our country has been distracted by this matter for too
long.'''
</P>
<P>
   The authors then place the blame squarely on the president for
the slow pace of the investigation. ``The president has pursued a
strategy of deceiving the American people and Congress in January
1998, delaying and impeding the criminal investigation for seven
months, and deceiving the American people and Congress again in
August 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps the most damaging portion of the report, Starr's
prosecutors say that Clinton lied under oath on five occasions,
both in the Paula Jones deposition and his grand jury testimony
last month, when he denied that he had ``a sexual affair, a sexual
relationship or sexual relations'' with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But the report said that the president's response to lying under
oath rests on his own narrow definition of ``sexual relations'' _
``namely, that it requires sexual intercourse, no matter how
extensive the sexual activities might otherwise be,'' the report
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the president,'' the report says, ``a man could
regularly engage in oral sex and fondling of breasts and genitals
with a woman and yet not have a `sexual affair' with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky testified before the grand jury in much detail
about ``substantial sexual activity'' that she said she engaged in
with Clinton, on 10 separate days in hallways, bathrooms and the
president's private study, from Nov. 15, 1995 to Dec. 28, 1997. She
said that Clinton made direct contact with her breasts and
genitalia.
</P>
<P>
   To corroborate her statements, prosecutors point to Ms.
Lewinsky's own testimony, and statements she made to 11 people.
They also quote a draft letter, gleaned from Ms. Lewinsky's home
computer, in which Ms. Lewinsky describes an incident in her
relationship with the president where she refers to ``watching your
mouth on my breast'' and refers implicitly to direct contact with
her genitalia.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky said that the president's ``hands-off policy''
suggests some kind of ``service contract _ that all I did was
perform oral sex on him and that that's all this relationship
was.''

GLENFED WRAPS UP MERGER WITH CALIFORNIA FEDERAL BANK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ About 200 people lost their jobs Friday when
Glendale Federal Bank completed its merger with San Francisco-based
California Federal Bank.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 more employees of GlenFed _ whose parent company had
been Golden State Bancorp _ will be cut by year's end, said Ken
Preston, vice president and manager of corporate communications for
GlenFed. Preston is one of those slated to lose his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's (Friday) the final day for the bank as a legal
company, so understandably morale is down a little bit,'' Preston
said. ``Of those that are leaving the company, quite a few have
found new jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 3,400 GlenFed employees, 2,700 will remain under the new
entity. Of the 700 to be let go, all but about 30 are in GlenFed's
Glendale headquarters, a San Diego loan center and a data center in
Brubank, a Los Angeles suburb, said Preston.
</P>
<P>
   The merger, one of dozens this year in the banking industry,
creates a thrift with $52 billion in assets, $28 billion in
deposits and 370 branches. The new company will retain the Golden
State Bancorp name but operate California Federal branches.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, oral arguments began Friday in Washington, D.C., in
the damages phase of GlenFed's breach of contract lawsuit against
the federal government over the government's 1989 ban on
``supervisory goodwill.'' Prior to the ban, the government had
given GlenFed and other thrifts leeway in accounting regulations in
exchange for taking over failed thrifts.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in GlenFed's favor in July 1996 and
the bank's attorney expects the bank to be awarded between $863
million to $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Glendale is a Los Angeles suburb located nine miles north of
downtown Los Angeles.  &QL;

 WASHINGTON: their activity.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clinton's testimony before the grand jury differed on several
points from Ms. Lewinsky's.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are free to infer that my testimony is that I did not have
sexual relations, as I understood this term to be defined,''
Clinton testified before the grand jury from the White House on
Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor asked, ``Including touching her breast, kissing
her breast, touching her genitalia?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's correct,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Friday, in two separate documents, there was a dispute
between the White House and Starr about fundamental facts of the
relationship. In its 78-page rebuttal, the White House wrote that
the relationship began in early 1996 and in one incident in early
1997. But in the report, Starr said that Ms. Lewinsky testified
that their intimate relationship began on Nov. 15, 1995, during the
government shutdown when they engaged in oral sex while the
president spoke on the telephone with a congressman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The motive for the president to make a false statement about
the date on which the sexual relationship started appears to have
been that the president was unwilling to admit sexual activity with
a young 22-year-old White House intern in the Oval Office area.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr also accuses Clinton of lying under oath when he testified
that he could not recall instances when he was alone with Ms.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, they said that Ms. Lewinsky testified that she was alone
on numerous occasions with the president inside the Oval Office,
the president's private study, the private bathroom across from the
study and the hallway that leads from the Oval Office to the
private dining room.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr's prosecutors have other witnesses who testified that
the president and Ms. Lewinsky were alone together, including Betty
Currie, the president's personal secretary, six Secret Service
agents and a White House steward, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   In the obstruction of justice portion of the report, prosecutors
say that Clinton took an active role in attempting to hide his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky from the Jones lawyers and later
from Starr's investigators by concealing gifts they exchanged,
which had been subpoenaed.
</P>
<P>
   ``An effort to obstruct justice by withholding the truth from
the legal process _ whether by lying under oath, concealing
documents, or improperly influencing a witness's testimony _ is a
federal crime,'' prosecutors write in the report. ``There is
substantial and credible information that President Clinton engaged
in in such efforts to prevent the truth of his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky from being revealed in the Jones case.''
</P>
<P>
   The report charges Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky of devising ``cover
stories'' to conceal their relationship. When Ms. Lewinsky spoke
about how to answer questions about why she was transferred out of
the White House, Clinton told her, ``You could always say that the
people in Legislative Affairs got it for you or helped you get
it.''
</P>
<P>
   It also accuses the president of taking a far more acting role
in attempting to persuade Ms. Lewinsky to deny she had a
relationship with him in a sworn affidavit to be filed in the Jones
case.
</P>
<P>
   In his grand jury testimony, Clinton said, ``I hoped that this
relationship would never become public.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, Starr's prosecutors advance a motive for steps that the
president took to keep it quiet. They said that after the Supreme
Court's unanimous decision on May 27, 1997, to order the Jones case
to go forward, there was added risk to the president of his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky being found out.
</P>
<P>
   The report accuses Clinton of obstructing justice by suggesting
that Ms. Lewinsky file an affidavit denying that he had a
relationship so she would not be deposed by the Jones lawyers.
During his deposition, the president's lawyer, Robert Bennett, read
Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit denying a ``sexual relationship'' with the
president. A lawyer for Ms. Jones asked, ``Is that a true and
accurate statement as far as you know it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is absolutely true,'' the president replied.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans and Democrats alike said Friday that
while there were no stunning revelations, they were deeply troubled
and distressed by details in the report by Kenneth Starr, the
Whitewater independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   But while Democrats were reluctant to defend President Clinton's
behavior as outlined in the report, the initial reaction from both
parties suggested that partisan battle lines were beginning to
emerge: Democrats accused Starr of overreaching by dwelling on
lurid sexual details, and Republicans sought to shift the debate to
the report's conclusions about perjury, obstruction of justice and
witness tampering.
</P>
<P>
   ``The misjudgments of the president are nearly equaled by the
need of Kenneth Starr to provide a level of sexual detail beyond
what was necessary to make his point or establish his case,'' said
Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J. ``His own lack of perspective and
tendency to go to excess undermines his credibility. This level of
sexual detail is clearly intended to inflame public passions.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, who is a member of the Judiciary
Committee, said he was particularly concerned not by the sexual
details but the other evidence. ``The allegations are far more
serious than I had anticipated,'' he said. ``You've got five
allegations of lying under oath; four allegations of obstructing
justice. I think it's more likely than not that the Judiciary
Committee as a whole would recommend that the House consider
initiating the impeachment inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who is chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, also sought to dispel the notion that the
report was only about sex. ``Some will try to make this just purely
a sexual matter,'' he said. ``And they'll try to say this is purely
a private matter. But I don't see anything that I've read so far
that indicates that Judge Starr is saying that he should be
impeached because of the sexual relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as he focused on the non-sexual allegations, Rep. Thomas
Davis, D-Va., did not shy from mentioning the ``very lurid and
graphic details'' in the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``These details will offend most Americans,'' Davis said.
``While demeaning to the institution of the presidency, these
details, alone, do not constitute impeachable offenses. However, if
proven true, the allegations in Judge Starr's report, such as
witness tampering and lying under oath to the grand jury, do
constitute impeachable offenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that Democrats would cast the report as needlessly
digging into Clinton's private conduct with Ms. Lewinsky, some
Republicans said they wished Starr had written been more broadly
about other issues that had been under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The allegation of abuse of office could yet be strengthened by
evidence of the president's role in Travelgate and Filegate and the
other matters under the jurisdiction of the independent counsel,''
said Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y. ``The sexual part of it, the unseemly
part, gives us pause but that is not a ground for impeachment. But
the other stuff potentially is.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the few Democrats who spoke out forcefully in defense of
Clinton was Rep. Robert Wexler of Florida, a member of the
Judiciary Committee, who sought to portray the report as
preoccupied with sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not make more of it than it is,'' he said. ``The
president didn't do what Lyndon Johnson did and lie about Vietnam.
President Clinton did not do what Ronald Reagan did and probably
lie about hostages and arms. The president lied about an
extra-marital affair _ let's put this in context.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another Democrat who spoke out was Rep. Charles Rangel of New
York. Rather than delve into the report itself, Rangel offered a
blanket defense of Clinton. ``We can call for forgiveness or we can
throw stones and cause further embarrassment to the president, his
family and the nation,'' he said. ``But the truth is that the will
of most Americans is that the president stay the course, not only
in his domestic policies but in the international crises.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most striking about the response Friday was that
virtually no other Democratic lawmakers _ not even the Democratic
leaders, Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota or Rep. Dick Gephardt of
Missouri _ or White House political aides rallied to Clinton's
defense, as many did when the allegations about Ms. Lewinsky first
emerged in January. Several members insisted that they needed time
to fully absorb the report; Gephardt's office said he was out of
town at his son's wedding and would have no comment this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were far more eager to speak out about their
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I have been able to review of this report thus
far,'' said Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., ``there appear to me to be
sufficient grounds for the House of Representatives to now begin
the impeachment process.''
</P>
<P>
   While Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said he ``will not rush to
judgment,'' his reaction to the report was far from subdued.
``These allegations are deplorable and disgusting,'' he said,
``and, if true, the president has undoubtedly let the nation
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., who is a member of the Judiciary
Committee, cautioned his colleagues against ``a stampede for
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson said: ``I am personally offended and deeply saddened
by much of the conduct that is described in the report. But it is
imperative for members of the Judiciary Committee not to reach a
conclusion as to whether an impeachment inquiry is justified until
having made a thorough review of all evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the Republican whip, said he was
``quite troubled by many of the allegations.'' Saying he still
expects Starr to turn up more evidence, DeLay added, ``I am also
troubled that this might not be the last of the allegations.''

STARR REPORT AN INTERNET MILESTONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Millions of people crowded into the world's electronic
meeting hall Friday, eager to read the lurid details of President
Clinton's affair with a White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   In an unprecedented move, Congress published independent counsel
Kenneth Starr's 445-page report on the Internet, and computer users
stampeded to read about the President and Monica Lewinsky's sexual
liaisons.
</P>
<P>
   Internet news services staggered under a midday crush, with many
computer users getting busy signals or error messages. But the
Internet traffic jam broke up within an hour, and the report was
widely available to anyone who wanted to point and click.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said the report's release marked a milestone for the
Internet, which as little as five years ago was populated mainly by
academics, researchers and scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never in history have we had this kind of political impact, to
reach so many people so fast,'' said Alice Christie, professor of
technology and education at ASU-West. ``And to have the government
just decide to just put it out there for everybody to see. That's
what makes it so unique.''
</P>
<P>
   Christie likened the development of the Internet to the
invention of the printing press, which spread the power of
information from the selected clergy to the masses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a lot of power in the hands of very few
people,'' she said. ``With the advent of the Internet, that power
structure is becoming much more broad.''
</P>
<P>
   The report's release showcased the Internet's strengths and
exposed its weaknesses. One one hand, there is a staggering amount
of room to publish. On the other, dissemination depends on a
sometimes fragile network of computers and phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Before noon Friday, many Inter net sites became jammed,
including four government sites where the report was posted.
Emerging from the rubble was CNN Interactive, which managed to post
the report by 11:45 a.m. and keep its site running.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman said CNN registered the most activity in its
history, some 340,000 ``hits'' per minute, which broke the record
of 320,000 per minute on Aug. 31, when the Dow Jones industrial
average had its second-largest point drop in history.
</P>
<P>
   Online news organizations reported record numbers of hits,
topping events like the Mars Pathfinder mission and the death of
Princess Diana. Before the report was even out, MSNBC recorded 2
million visitors to its website, double its previous record.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrin Roberts said the network went to ``breaking news mode,''
simplifying its home page and limiting graphics, which often add to
the time it takes to download pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of practice . . . coping with the extreme
peaks of traffic that an event like this leads to,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arizona Republic'' web site, Arizona Central
(www.azcentral.com) posted the report at 12:43 p.m. Chris Lavelle,
electronic media manager for ``The Republic,'' said the site
received about 8,000 requests for the report in the first 90
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our experience with the instantaneous coverage of the (Gov.
Fife) Symington trial and sentencing prepared us to handle today's
Starr report,'' Lavelle said.
</P>
<P>
   The report caused a slight stir at the Arizona State University
computer center. Matt Caughey, 21, a junior computer science major,
was reading every word of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew a lot of it before because of the leaks, but it tracks
a lot of what Clinton did,'' said Caughey, who came to the computer
room specifically to look at the report. ``I think it's grounds for
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Caughey got on to CNN's website on his first try.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Connelly wasn't so lucky. He gave up trying to log on to
CNN and instead started scrolling through old ``Seinfeld'' scripts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CNN site just said, `Try again later.','' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's lawyers argued Friday that
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's impeachment referral to
Congress was sprinkled with salacious and lurid details solely to
humiliate the president and drive him from office.
</P>
<P>
   In their 78-page response, couched in tones that are both
conversational and combative, the Clinton lawyers sought to portray
the president's behavior as a major personal failing for which he
has accepted responsibility but nothing serious enough to warrant
his impeachment and removal from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In comments to reporters Friday afternoon, David Kendall, the
president's personal lawyer, pressed the notion that Clinton's
sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky ``was not a new story''
but rather fit an age-old human pattern of illicit sex and
understandable efforts by both partners to conceal it from the rest
of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``In short this is personal, not impeachable,'' Kendall told
reporters gathered in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. The
report emphasized that the president has admitted that his sexual
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky was a serious error, but that,
``This private mistake does not amount to an impeachable action.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of what amounted to the first draft of the
president's defense brief before Congress and the nation is the
argument that impeachment should be reserved for the gravest of
crimes and that Starr has inflated Clinton's offenses to satisfy
his own political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   In the report, which was prepared even before the Clinton
lawyers were able to see Starr's 445-page referral to the House of
Representatives, the Clinton lawyers reached back into the history
of the Republic to argue that utilizing the Constitution's
impeachment clause was a wholly disproportionate response to the
president's misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton lawyers argued that the nation's founders believed _
and contemporary scholars agree _ that impeachment was designed as
the most serious form of sanction to be used only for ``the most
serious forms of wrongdoing.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also sought to dispute charges made by Starr that the
president committed perjury, tried to obstruct justice, tampered
with witnesses or abused the powers of his office in trying to
bolster his deception that he had not had an intimate relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   And in one section of the report rendered with anger, the
Clinton lawyers asked rhetorically: ``Where's Whitewater?''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers said that as evidence of Starr's motives he has not
formally exonerated the president or Mrs. Clinton even though the
prosecutor apparently has been unable to find any evidence of their
wrongdoing in the Whitewater land deal in Arkansas that was the
original issue to be investigated. The report also said that Starr
was evidently unable to come up with anything improper involving
the Clintons' behavior in his investigations of other matters,
including the dismissal of longtime employees at the White House
travel office and the acquisition by the White House of
investigative files of more than 900 people, some of them prominent
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means that the Office of Independent Counsel report is
left with nothing but the details of a private sexual relationship
told in graphic details with the intent to embarrass,'' the Clinton
lawyers argued.
</P>
<P>
   But the complexities of trying to knit the legal and political
strands of the president's case were evident in his lawyers'
exquisitely nuanced arguments as to why Clinton was not guilty of
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been expressing contrition on almost a daily basis
for the last few weeks, insisting that he has thoroughly come to
terms with his actions. At the same time, he continues to insist
that he was truthful when he told lawyers for Paula Jones that he
had not engaged in sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky. To do
otherwise could lend credence to a perjury charge, Clinton's
advisers have said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr devoted considerable portions of his report developing the
argument that Clinton committed perjury by lying in his Jan. 17,
1998, deposition to lawyers for Mrs. Jones who were trying to show
that Clinton had a pattern of engaging in sexually irresponsible
behavior. In response to a question, Clinton testified that he had
not engaged in sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In their extended explanation, Clinton's lawyers argued that his
answers were truthful because he did not engage in traditional
sexual intercourse. At the time of the Jones deposition, the trial
judge had approved a specific definition of sexual relations and
Clinton has asserted that he believed the definition covered
traditional intercourse but not, for example, oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president testified truthfully,'' Kendall said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, a statement must be false to lead to a perjury
charge. But a misleading answer may not constitute perjury.
</P>
<P>
   The argument advanced by Kendall and Charles F.C. Ruff, the
White House counsel and co-author of Friday's report, is that the
lawyers for Mrs. Jones did not press Clinton to answer further
questions.
</P>
<P>
   During the deposition, Clinton said he agreed with an affidavit
of Ms. Lewinsky asserting they had never engaged in a sexual
relationship. ``To the president, that term reasonably requires
sexual intercourse as a necessary component of the relationship,''
the Clinton report said. ``Since his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky
did not involve intercourse, he truthfully answered that the
affadavit was accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the lawyers argued that Clinton accurately denied
having a ``sexual affair'' with Ms. Lewinsky because he understood
that term to require traditional sexual intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall told reporters that the allegations about the details of
the sexual relationship were included in the Starr report for
political purposes only. ``The salacious allegations in this
referral are simply designed to humiliate, embarrass and
politically damage the president,'' he said.

 WASHINGTON: he said. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Starr's lawyers argued they were obliged to include so many
details about the actual sexual activities because Clinton
interpreted the definition of ``sexual relations'' in such a narrow
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Friday whether Clinton had invited the inclusion of those
details with that definition, Kendall repeated that Clinton had
answered all questions accurately, if not completely. The
inclusions of descriptions of specific sex acts, he said, ``exceeds
any legitimate justification.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall also laid the foundation for Clinton's defense against
obstruction of justice charges, denying that Clinton had urged
anyone to lie, but acknowledging that ``in all such wrongful,
improper relations there is concomitant concealment, by its very
nature.''
</P>
<P>
   In their rebuttal, Clinton's lawyers underlined that Starr
failed to show that Clinton or anyone in the White House helped
write the so-called ``talking points.'' Ms. Lewinsky testified that
she wrote these talking points on her own and gave them to her
onetime friend Linda Tripp, to alter Ms. Tripp's account of
Clinton's encounter with another woman in a way that would not hurt
the president.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton lawyers noted that the talking points were widely
described in press accounts as the linchpin of the Starr
investigation and, in fact, were used by Starr as a justification
for investigating the Lewinsky matter because they raised issues of
suborning perjury.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton report said of the talking points, ``in the fullness
of time, and after investigation, they have vanished entirely. Only
the stigma remains.''

AT LAST, TEXAS GETS ANOTHER SHOT AT UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like a mantra gone bad, the drum beat of an extended headache
has throbbed incessantly. 66-3. 66-3. 66-3. 66-3.
</P>
<P>
   Texas can't forget last year's 63-point loss at home to UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always in the back of our minds,'' defensive tackle Casey
Hampton said. ``When we're running sprints, somebody will holler,
`66-3.' It came up all the time. Why wouldn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Today at the Rose Bowl, the 23rd-ranked Longhorns (1-0) hope to
exorcise their demons as they help the sixth-ranked Bruins open
their season. A regional television audience will also be treated
to a matchup of Heisman Trophy candidates (Ricky Williams of Texas,
Cade McNown of UCLA).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to tell how much that game bothers our team,'' said
Texas' first-year coach Mack Brown. ``Any time you lose a game by
that margin, it's difficult to handle.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown and the Longhorns hope that the Bruins have difficulty
handling Williams. In last year's game, Williams was rendered
ineffective as UCLA jumped to a 38-0 halftime lead. He finished
with 36 yards on 13 carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky's our best offensive weapon,'' Brown said. ``He may be
our best defensive weapon. If he's on the field, it means our
defense is on the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   With McNown in control, the Bruins figure to have a potent
offense. Last season, UCLA averaged 430 yards and 39 points per
game.
</P>
<P>
   However, UCLA must find a replacement for running back Skip
Hicks (1,282 yards, 22 touchdowns). Jermaine Lewis, a 5-foot-7,
177-pound sophomore, gets the start, but junior Keith Brown and
freshman DeShaun Foster will also play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a back rush for at least 1,000 yards each of the
last four seasons,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo said. ``I don't know if
we'll have a back that will get that many carries. It will be
running back by committee.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither team figures to field a strong defense. UCLA has just
two seniors on a unit that allowed 351 yards per game last season;
Texas, which allowed 399 yards per game last season, has just two
seniors on its defensive two-deep roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year's game was humiliating,'' Texas senior wide receiver
Wane McGarity said. ``We almost looked like a high school team.
UCLA probably doesn't have any respect for us. But I think they
better watch out, because this is a new team that will play them
heads up.''

DAVENPORT'S SPECIAL SKILL: PATIENCE
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TEN-USOPEN)  
(nk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lindsay Davenport entered the post-match news
conference Friday night half walking, half floating. This was the
wake of her greatest triumph and the eve of her greatest moment.
</P>
<P>
   Half an hour earlier Davenport had taken on Venus Williams in a
highly anticipated semifinal match at the U.S. Open. Davenport had
made a shambles of the match, relying on power serves and forehand
cross-court rallies. But mostly she did it with patience.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport dispatched Williams in 72 minutes, 6-4, 6-4. Patience.
She waited on the baseline and waited for her younger, quicker,
eager opponent to make errors.
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams was a much better player this year than she was
last year when she reached the finals here. Flashier, too. She wore
a fire-engine-red outfit with the back cut out, the sixth of seven
dresses supplied by her sponsor, Reebok, that she brought for the
tournament. Davenport was the better player. She made Venus run.
She made Venus lunge.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in the second set, after Davenport broke her service,
Williams took a bathroom break. After the match, Davenport said she
thought Williams may have been trying to slow her momentum.
``Probably,'' Davenport said. ``I played her a couple of weeks ago
in Stanford. When I got up a set and a break, she called an injury
timeout. I was kind of laughing that she might do that, jokingly,
before the match, and then she did it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the final point, Davenport said, when she saw Williams' shot
was going long, and that she was headed to her first final, she was
filled with emotions. Relief. Happiness. Joy. She thought of all
the hard knocks, the criticism, the pudgy girl who came up through
the ranks but was never the favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, no one ever said when I was growing up I was ever
going to be as good or get to a grand slam final,'' said Davenport,
22. ``I wasn't expected to do anything. I think I've proven a lot
of people wrong. I think I've tried so hard to do the best I can.
I'm not the most unbelievable athlete, I'm not anything. I just
tried so hard to get where I'm at. I think it's great.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Davenport's best virtues, one that should define the day,
is patience. In a sport and at a time when everyone wants to be a
young millionaire, Davenport is a refreshing breeze.
</P>
<P>
   She was nearly dragged onto the national stage in the wake of
Jennifer Capriati's youth-induced crash. In a sport dangerously
like gymnastics, where a premium is placed on being young,
Davenport was the next prodigy in women's tennis.
</P>
<P>
   One problem: she wasn't ready. And beyond that she didn't want
to get on that circus ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, I really feel like I've done my own way,'' she said.
``almost through the back door in the beginning. Just kind of
played . No one ever picked me to do well. I just kind of improved,
was able to do it out of the spotlight, was able to kind of grow up
at my own pace, do everything that I wanted to do before I really
set my eyes on tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who was discovered at age 15 and at age 18 has
competed in her first real year on the pro tour, has quickly been
touted as a new, controversial princess: tall, attractive,
athletic. And different.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' manager, Leland Hardy, predicted that a victory by
Williams would have triggered a revolution. ``Without question,''
he said, ``the level of interest in tennis, the active
participation in tennis, among disadvantaged people who can have a
kinship with Venus Williams from both her circumstances and the
unmistakable unavoidable fact that she's a black teen.''
</P>
<P>
   The deluge will have to wait. Davenport was convincing in 72
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   There is no love lost between the rivals. Friday, Davenport
wondered what outfit Williams planned to wear had she made the
finals. (``It was red, white and blue,'' Venus said. ``Of course,
with matching hair and nails.'').
</P>
<P>
   Davenport conceded that Williams is the better athlete. ``Venus
is a tremendous athlete,'' she said. ``Probably the best one that
plays tennis. But for me, I have to stick to the things I do well;
that's hitting ground stroke, that's being aggressive, not being on
the defensive, and keeping people off balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Patience, truly is a virtue. &QL;

CHARGES YES, BUT ARE THEY IMPEACHABLE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER S. CANELLOS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr's report outlines some potentially impeachable
offenses by President Clinton, legal specialists said Friday, but
it lacks the ``smoking gun'' that some of Clinton's defenders had
feared would jeopardize his presidency before he could mount a
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Buttressed by a lab report showing Clinton's DNA on Lewinsky's
dress, Starr's case is strongest that the president lied when he
denied, in a civil deposition, having had ``sexual relations'' with
Monica S. Lewinsky, and especially when he confirmed as truthful
Lewinsky's own, plainly false, affidavit denying sexual contact.
</P>
<P>
   But perjury in a civil case, a crime that is rarely charged, may
not constitute an impeachable offense, some lawyers argued.
</P>
<P>
   More serious are the claims that Clinton, embattled in the White
House, sought to cover up evidence and influence witnesses against
him. Starr forges an intriguing chain of events surrounding
President Clinton's efforts to help Lewinsky get a job, and, later,
Lewinsky's return of gifts to the White House, but important links
remain unconnected, specialists said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obstruction of justice would be impeachable,'' said Fred
Lawrence, vice dean of Boston University Law School. ``It would
depend on the strength of the evidence. And based on a summary of
(Starr's report), it's not very strong.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bruce Yannett, a former prosecutor on independent counsel
Lawrence Walsh's Iran-Contra staff, noted that in Starr's account,
Lewinsky _ not Clinton _ first suggests that she should return his
gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The obstruction stuff is very flimsy,'' Yannett said, after
reviewing the report.
</P>
<P>
   Still, legal specialists said, the report is strong enough to
put Clinton under intense pressure to refute Starr's charges; and
many said that the perjury claim alone could prompt persuasive
arguments for his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Starting immediately, they said, Clinton will occupy a unique
position in the American justice system. As a president under
formal threat of impeachment, Clinton will be a de facto criminal
defendant, but his political position will effectively deprive him
of important defense tactics, such as taking the Fifth Amendment.
Still, unlike other defendants, he will be judged by a jury _
Congress _ that is uniquely prone to political pressures.
</P>
<P>
   A spirited public defense, or even a humble plea for sympathy,
could prompt a wave of support that overwhelms even credible
evidence against him; just as likely, public anger over sordid
revelations about his conduct could torpedo his case before his
lawyers even engage in a sober weighing of the facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impeachment is a real hybrid of law and politics,'' said
Boston defense attorney Robert Sheketoff. ``If you believe every
case is in some way influenced by politics, this is the ultimate
example of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheketoff added, ``My advice to him would be to hire some
political consultant to advise his lawyer on how different defenses
will sell politically.''
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, the president's personal attorney, Friday offered
a preview of how he plans to poke holes into Starr's case. It's a
mixture of broad assertions and narrow legalisms.
</P>
<P>
   In his boldest thrusts, seemingly aimed more at the public
sympathy than Congress, Kendall questions the legitimacy of Starr's
investigation, noting that no impeachable offenses grew out of his
initial charge to investigate the president's Whitewater land
dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Kendall criticizes Starr for using the list of
``talking points'' that Lewinsky handed Linda Tripp as a key piece
of evidence to persuade Attorney General Janet Reno to approve his
investigation of the president. Lewinsky, in her grand jury
testimony, reportedly said she wrote the document, designed to
shape Tripp's own testimony, herself.
</P>
<P>
   On the perjury claim, however, Kendall retreats somewhat: ``He
gave narrow answers to ambiguous questions. As a matter of law,
those answers could not give rise to a criminal charge of
perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   Before giving his deposition, Clinton was read a list of acts
that included touching various body parts, and asked whether his
contact with Lewinsky met this definition of sex. He said no. Her
testimony disputes him: She told the grand jury he touched her
breasts and genital area _ both acts covered on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also offers substantial corroborating evidence of an
affair _ from the DNA on Lewinsky's dress to White House logs
confirming her visits to the Oval Office. But on issue of whether
and where the president touched her _ it's her word against his.
</P>
<P>
   Legal specialists offered varying views on the significance of
her contradiction of his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   F. Dennis Saylor, former chief of staff of the criminal division
of the Justice Department under President George Bush, said that
the perjury claim could form a basis for impeachment, on the theory
that the president, of all people, should follow the law
religiously.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president wears many hats,'' Saylor said. ``One of them is
chief law-enforcement officer. He's taken an oath to uphold the
laws of the United States. He should be held to the highest
imaginable standards.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Lawrence, the BU vice dean and a former federal
prosecutor, argues that the perjury case may be even less
persuasive as a crime justifying impeachment because Clinton's
alleged lying was semantical _ ``lying not about what he did, but
about how it should be construed,'' or about ``shades of the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Saylor and Lawrence, however, agreed that the claim that
Clinton obstructed justice was much more serious and threatening to
his hold on the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   That claim takes several forms: Clinton's alleged assistance in
finding a job for Lewinsky, and his role in her returning of gifts
he had given her.
</P>
<P>
   Starr notes that Lewinsky's job search occurred during a time
when Clinton was facing potential questions about his sex life from
attorneys representing Paula Jones in her sexual harassment case
against him. Nonetheless, Lewinsky testified, the search began
before she received a subpoena to testify in the Jones case. And
while aware of the search, Clinton offered no other direct
assistance, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's final meeting with Clinton, however, occurred on
December 28, 1997 _ after she had received a subpoena to testify in
the case and produce any gifts from Clinton. The meeting was around
Christmas, and he gave her five small presents.
</P>
<P>
   According to Starr's report, ``At some point in the
conversation, Ms. Lewinsky told the president, `Maybe I should put
the gifts away outside my house somewhere or give them to someone,
maybe Betty (Currie, the president's secretary).' Ms Lewinsky
testified that the president responded either `I don't know' or
`Let me think about that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, Currie drove to Lewinsky's house and
collected the gifts. Currie suggested that Lewinsky had called and
asked her to collect the gifts. She testified that she didn't know
whether Clinton knew of it or not.
</P>
<P>
   Though the timeframe was damaging _ Clinton and Lewinsky
discussing gifts and subpoenas while Jones's attorneys awaited
testimony _ some legal specialists noted that Lewinsky's and
Currie's testimony did not specifically implicate Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``She initiated it,'' Yannett said of Lewinsky. ``She
volunteered to return the gifts. She's the one who, for months and
months, asked for a job. And the talking points came from her.''

KENNETH STARR'S REPORT FAILS TO SHOCK STOCK MARKET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kenneth Starr's report on the president hit
cyberspace but didn't sink the market.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street, clobbered Thursday on worries about possible
impeachment of President Clinton, reacted positively as the report
went on the Internet during Friday's session. The initial read: no
major surprises, lessening the possibility that Clinton will leave
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing new or shocking in the report,'' said Jon
Baranko, senior equity trader at Strong Funds in Milwaukee. ``In
the absence of any bad news other than what's already known, it
gave the market a sense of relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's apologies also seem to improve his chances of staying
in office, which the market prefers, said Tony Bernardo, a finance
professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 179.96 points to close at
7,795.50, with 25 gainers and 5 losers. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index rose 28.87 to 1,009.06, with 411 stocks rising and 81
declining, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 56.31 to
1,641.64.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's problems and their impact on the market have provoked
comparisons to former President Nixon, who resigned in 1974. A bear
market started in early 1973 as the Watergate scandal deepened,
dropped off sharply in the year Nixon resigned, then rebounded
strongly in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   However, economists believe Nixon's troubles were secondary to
the impact of economic problems _ including high oil prices,
inflation and interest rates _ in knocking down the market. They
generally believe that the opportunity for a rebound from current
economic problems is far stronger this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is much healthier today than it was before'' even
though growth is slowing down because of global economic problems,
said Edward Leamer, professor of business economics at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   While markets dislike the uncertainty in the White House,
analysts also stressed Friday that Clinton's fate was less critical
to the market than the actions of Federal Reserve Board Chairman
Alan Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as Rubin lends support and stays, and Greenspan keeps
his focus on keeping us out of a recession, these are bigger issues
for the market than what's going on in Washington,'' said Baranko.
For the next few months, the market will take into account that the
Clinton crisis will continue, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Ritter, a retiree in Northridge who also was an investor
in 1974, believes Clinton's problems won't have a long-lasting
effect on the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's significant,'' he said. ``If they
discovered that Greenspan was quitting, it would be a lot more
significant.'' &QL;

BILL AND MONICA'S STARR-CROSSED AFFAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES KELLY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - It may be too much to say that the affair between
Monica and Bill was like all affairs. But this Starr-crossed
relationship did share elements with many other sort-of-love
stories.
</P>
<P>
   It had its moments of romance and tawdriness and heartbreak. It
was marked by danger and frustration as well as fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   And, as with so many, it ended badly.
</P>
<P>
   They called each other fond names and exchanged funny little
gifts. They engaged in sex acts while he was on the phone. He
promised to call her, but sometimes he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   The President often wore one of the many neckties she gave him.
He even hinted that he might some day leave his wife.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't.
</P>
<P>
   And people got hurt - lots of people, in lots of different ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never expected to fall in love with the president,``
Lewinsky told prosecutors. ``I was surprised that I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she apparently expected something from the very
beginning. After all, according to the Starr report released
Friday, she made the first move.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky obtained an internship at the White House in early July
1995, at the age of 21. At the time, the President was 48, more
than twice her age.
</P>
<P>
   During the following month, she made eye contact with him at
various events, shook hands and introduced herself. Thus began what
she called an ``intense flirtation,'' one that culminated during
the government shutdown in November 1995, when fewer than
one-fourth of White House workers were on duty.
</P>
<P>
   The short-staffing meant Lewinsky had additional duties and more
freedom to roam the semi-deserted White House. She made the most of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky wound up alone with Clinton in the Chief of Staff's
office. At one point, she lifted her coat in the back to show him
the straps of her thong underwear.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, they got together near the study off the Oval
Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked briefly and sort of acknowledged that there had been
a chemistry that was there before and that we were both attracted
to each other and then he asked if he could kiss me,`` she told the
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   She said he could. They did.
</P>
<P>
   But the day wasn't over.
</P>
<P>
   At Clinton's invitation, they rendezvoused again about 10 p.m.
in the windowless hallway adjacent to the study, where they began a
sexual encounter.
</P>
<P>
   He took a phone call in the back office, but their sex play
continued. She performed oral sex on him while he spoke on the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   The affair included ten sexual encounters over the next year and
a half, Lewinsky said. The Starr report doesn't make it clear where
the President's wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, was during most of
these episodes.
</P>
<P>
   On ten to 15 other occasions, Lewinsky said, Lewinsky and
Clinton had phone sex. After one such session, Clinton had the bad
grace to fall asleep in the middle of the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   However, from Lewinsky's point of view at least, the
relationship was about more than sex. She called him ``Handsome.''
He - sometimes - called her ``Sweetie'' or ``Baby'' or ``Dear.''
</P>
<P>
   He told her they were both ``emotive and full of fire'' - a line
that smacks of policy-wonk poetry, but apparently one that
impressed her.
</P>
<P>
   He told her she made him feel young.
</P>
<P>
   She - more romantically - resorted to classic poetry in a
Valentine's Day classified ad she placed in ``The Washington Post''
on Feb. 14, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Addressed to ``HANDSOME,'' the ad consisted mostly of a
quotation from Romeo and Juliet: ``With love's light wings did/I
o'er perch these walls/For stony limits cannot hold love out,/And
what love can do that dares love attempt.''
</P>
<P>
   Their mutual gifts, though, seldom rose above the obvious. Among
other things, Clinton gave Lewinsky a hat pin, two brooches, a
marble bear figurine and a special edition of Walt Whitman's
``Leaves of Grass''. He liked frogs, so she gave him, among other
gifts, a frog figurine and a letter opener depicting a frog.
</P>
<P>
   She also gave him a silver tabletop holder for cigars or
cigarettes, a copy of ``Peter the Great,'' and six neckties, which
she - of course - liked to see him wear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to say to him that, `I like it when you wear my ties
because then I know I'm close to your heart,' '' Lewinsky recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the affair secret wasn't easy. To lessen the risk during
their sexual encounters, most of which took place in the windowless
hallway near the study off the Oval Office, they never fully
undressed.
</P>
<P>
   And they were as quiet as possible. During sex, Clinton
sometimes put a hand over her mouth.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewinsky was sometimes irked by the President's concern for
caution.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 28, 1997, when she was getting what she later described
as ``my Christmas kiss'' in the doorway to the study, Clinton was
``looking out the window with his eyes wide open while he was
kissing me and then I got mad because it wasn't very romantic.''
Clinton's response to her: ``Well, I was just looking to see to
make sure no one was out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Though their relationship was furtive, Lewinsky - like many
embroiled in such an affair - hoped it someday would become more
open and respectable.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told Lewinsky, according to a friend of Lewinsky's, that
he was uncertain that he would remain married after he left the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   The friend said Lewinsky thought, ``maybe she will be his
wife.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was not to be. And the end for Monica and Bill came more
in the form of farce than drama.
</P>
<P>
   On March 29, 1997, the last time they had sex, Clinton told her
he suspected an unspecified foreign embassy was tapping his phone.
</P>
<P>
   If she was ever questioned about the affair, he said, she should
say they were just friends. If the phone sex came to light, she
should say they'd known those calls were being monitored all along,
and that it was a put-on.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, on May 24, Clinton put the relationship to
rest. Lewinsky was called to the White House. She went there
wearing a straw hat with a hat pin Clinton had given her, and
bringing gifts for him, including a puzzle and a Banana Republic
shirt.
</P>
<P>
   The President told her the affair had to end. Earlier in his
marriage, he said, he had had hundreds of affairs. Since turning
40, though, he had tried hard to be faithful. She wept, tried to
change his mind. But she couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky went home. Though she would try again to get back
together with Clinton, she would fail. Eventually, all she would
have left would be her memories, a few negligible gifts, and a blue
dress.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, they were mementos.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, they would be evidence. &QL;

 WASHINGTON: he said. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Starr's lawyers argued they were obliged to include so many
details about the actual sexual activities because Clinton
interpreted the definition of ``sexual relations'' in such a narrow
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Friday whether Clinton had invited the inclusion of those
details with that definition, Kendall repeated that Clinton had
answered all questions accurately, if not completely. The
inclusions of descriptions of specific sex acts, he said, ``exceeds
any legitimate justification.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall also laid the foundation for Clinton's defense against
obstruction of justice charges, denying that Clinton had urged
anyone to lie, but acknowledging that ``in all such wrongful,
improper relations there is concomitant concealment, by its very
nature.''
</P>
<P>
   In their rebuttal, Clinton's lawyers underlined that Starr
failed to show that Clinton or anyone in the White House helped
write the so-called ``talking points.'' Ms. Lewinsky testified that
she wrote these talking points on her own and gave them to her
onetime friend Linda Tripp, to alter Ms. Tripp's account of
Clinton's encounter with another woman in a way that would not hurt
the president.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton lawyers noted that the talking points were widely
described in press accounts as the linchpin of the Starr
investigation and, in fact, were used by Starr as a justification
for investigating the Lewinsky matter because they raised issues of
suborning perjury.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton report said of the talking points, ``in the fullness
of time, and after investigation, they have vanished entirely. Only
the stigma remains.''

DIVERS FIND 2D RECORDER FROM SWISSAIR 111  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ After battling heavy seas for the better
part of the week, divers late Friday made a breakthrough in the
investigation of the Swissair Flight 111 crash, retrieving the
cockpit voice recorder from the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The recorder monitors conversation between pilots inside the
cockpit, and the tape may shed more light on the final moments of
the jetliner before it crashed into the ocean on the night of Sept.
2, killing all 229 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the material on the tape can be compared with sounds from
the jetliner's flight data recorder, which was fished from the
Atlantic on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks very hopeful,'' said Jim Harris, spokesman for the
Transportation Safety Board of Canada, the main agency
investigating the crash. ``By finding both flight recorders, we
might get to the cause of the accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon its return to land, the recorder was stored in a box of
fresh water to help preserve it, then placed aboard a plane headed
to the Canadian capital, Ottawa. Both boxes will be examined at the
safety board's engineering laboratory there, and specialists say it
may take two days to obtain a summary.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they were unsure of the form in which that
summary would be released; unlike the United States, Canada
routinely does not disclose transcripts from cockpit voice
recorders, to protect the privacy of pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The cockpit recorder was recovered from 180 feet of water by
divers operating from the Canadian Forces ship Gramby, said Tony
Blom, communications direcor of the Canadian safety board.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery was made about 6 p.m. local time in waters off the
fishing village of Peggy's Cove, officials said. It follows days of
frustration when Canadian Forces ships picked up signals from the
recorder on the ocean floor but could not locate the sealed box.
</P>
<P>
   If it functions, the recorder could provide the last 30 minutes
of conversation between the crew and the air traffic controllers,
as well as among the crew members. The tape also should report
sounds such as emergency alarms, said Harris.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it works, it will be a great asset. But if it doesn't, we
will have to fall back to what we know,'' said Harris.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder, which already is being analyzed, could
tell investigators how the aircraft's hydraulics and other systems
were working, officials say. The flight recorder measures the
plane's mechanical data, including its speed.
</P>
<P>
   However, the flight recorder stopped recording data after the
plane descended to 10,000 feet, and there are indications of a
general electrical failure aboard the jetliner at that time. It is
likely that information from the second recorder may also end at
that time, specialists say. The pilots, seeking an emergency
landing, lost contact with air controllers six minutes before the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   The latest discovery came a day after divers recovered human
remains on the ocean bottom near the spot where the Geneva-bound
MD-11 aircraft crashed. So far, only four of the victims have been
identified.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery came hours after scores of reporters on the scene
for more than a week had departed from Halifax and as the
government was closing down a media center.

WOMEN TRAILING BEHIND, IN FRONT OF TV CAMERAS, STUDY SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Women have become less likely to hold key
behind-the-scenes slots on top TV shows, with participation falling
to 23 percent during the past season from 28 percent in 1995-96, a
study says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conventional wisdom is that things are getting better for
women in television,'' wrote Martha Lauzen, who conducted the
Employment and Equality Opportunity study, released Friday, for the
Women in Film advocacy group. ``This shows how important it is not
to trust the conventional wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   Lauzen, a professor of communications at San Diego State
University, based her research on the 64 top-rated TV shows of the
first three months of the 1997-98 season. She says women held 19
percent of executive producer posts and comprised 29 percent of
producers, 8 percent of directors, 20 percent of writers and none
of the directors of photography.
</P>
<P>
   The study's findings are similar to those in Lauzen's recent
survey of women in the movie business showing that 21 percent of
executive producers and 20 percent of producers were women.
</P>
<P>
   Lauzen's TV study finds females represented 38 percent of major
characters and 39 percent of all characters. Of those, 65 percent
were in their 20s or 30s, 81 percent were white and 18 percent were
portrayed in positions of power, compared to 29 percent of male
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Only 24 percent of women portrayed on TV were 40 or older, while
38 percent of male characters were in that age group.
</P>
<P>
   The study says the presence of a female executive producer led
to more participation in other categories, with female characters
comprising 42 percent of the cast on such shows and 27 percent of
writers for those shows. Without a female in the executive producer
slot, women amounted to 36 percent of the cast and 13 percent of
the writers.

 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With tears in his eyes, President Clinton on Friday
morning told a roomful of clergy that he had sinned. He spoke just
hours before the world was presented with a painstaking account by
prosecutors of when, where, and how.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing an annual prayer breakfast at the White House,
Clinton drew on the New Testament, the Yom Kippur liturgy and
Ernest Hemingway as he made his most abject confession yet of
personal failure, while declaring that he would defend and redeem
his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is a fancy way to say that I have
sinned,'' he admitted softly, saying that after resisting
expressions of contrition he had reached ``the rock-bottom truth of
where I am.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Clinton also asked for forgiveness from
Monica Lewinsky, on the day that the details of their intimate
relationship _ details that he had denied and struggled to suppress
_ poured out through the Internet, whose wonders as a tool of
communication he has so often extolled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to me,'' the president told the prayer
meeting, ``that everybody who has been hurt know that the sorrow I
feel is genuine: first, and most important, my family; also my
friends, my staff, my Cabinet; Monica Lewinsky and her family, and
the American people. I have asked all for their forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 10-minute remarks, Clinton tried to walk a line between
abject contrition and the fierce determination to fight that he has
expressed privately to friends. ``I will instruct my lawyers to
mount a vigorous defense, using all available appropriate legal
arguments,'' he said, ``but legal language must not obscure the
fact that I have done wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Clinton's lawyers later issued a 73-page defense before
they had read the report by Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater
independent counsel. Starr and Congress had rebuffed White House
requests for an advance look at the report.
</P>
<P>
   In the company of clerics and to refrains of Scripture, the
president spent a solemn morning in public with his wife, Hillary.
He spoke at the annual prayer breakfast first, and then went to the
National Cathedral at midday to address a memorial service for the
victims of the twin bombings at U.S. embassies in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In a more raucous setting early Friday evening, on the South
Lawn of the White House, Clinton received an award for his work on
the Ulster peace accord from a group of Irish-Americans. As speaker
after speaker lauded the president's work for peace, the crowd rose
repeatedly in whooping ovations. Seated side by side on stage, the
Clintons laughed and waved, and leaned often toward each other to
whisper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary and I have been over there just lapping this up,''
Clinton said when he finally stood to speak after almost an hour.
``We don't want this to ever end.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a fundamentally normal presidential schedule, on one of
the strangest days in the history of the presidency. The Clintons,
two fierce political fighters, had finally and utterly lost perhaps
their most bitterly fought battle, to maintain what Mrs. Clinton
has often called a ``zone of privacy'' for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an unusual, and I think unusually important, day
today,'' the president said in his remarks at the prayer breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton expressed gratitude to those who thought ``the bounds of
privacy have been excessively and unwisely invaded,'' but added
that in this case the invasion ``may be a blessing, because I still
sinned. And if my repentance is genuine and sustained and if I can
maintain both a broken spirit and a strong heart, then good can
come of this for our country as well as for me and my family.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his experience could teach children that ``integrity is
important and selfishness is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not always seem grim in public on Friday. At the
memorial service, he turned around in his straight-backed chair to
exchange a laugh with Donna Shalala, the secretary of health and
human services.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting Clinton called to apologize to his Cabinet on
Thursday, Shalala challenged an argument he made that presidents
should be judged by their policies in public, not their behavior in
private. ``Mr. President, surely you don't believe that,'' she
said, according to a person familiar with the exchange. Clinton did
not back down an inch, this person said.
</P>
<P>
   While his lawyers were distributing their defense of the
president, he was at a memorial service for the 12 Americans who
died in the embassy bombings on Aug. 7. Clinton recalled the public
and private aspects of their lives as he spoke from the limestone
lectern in the vast, echoing National Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two sides of their lives _ who they were in their labors,
and who they were as husbands and wives, sons and daughters,
friends and colleagues, came together,'' he said. ``For as they
showed every day in their devotion to family and friends, their
work was about bringing better lives to all.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was the breakfast speech that was the centerpiece of
Clinton's day, and he told his aides that he was up until 4 a.m.
working, scribbling it on three small sheets of paper. Despite a
request by one senior aide, the president refused to show his staff
his remarks before delivering them.
</P>
<P>
   In those remarks, the president said that God could ``make us
strong at the broken places,'' a thought drawn from Hemingway's ``A
Farewell to Arms.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that while he must always keep his failure ``as a
caution light in my life,'' the country itself must ``move
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Clerics who attended the breakfast said they had been impressed
and moved by Clinton's words of contrition, in language that drew
on both Christian and Jewish traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was repentant this morning,'' said the Rev. Joan
Brown Campbell, general secretary of the National Council of
Churches. ``And for me, that's more important than being sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the question for our nation is: Are we prepared to be
led by a repentant sinner?'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Paul Menitoff, executive vice president of the Central
Conference of American Rabbis, which represents leaders in
Judaism's Reform movement, said he was impressed that Clinton's
remarks followed the basic steps required for repentance on Yom
Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement _ a candid admission of
wrongdoing, an apology to those who were wronged, a plea for
forgiveness and a pledge to avoid such behavior in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so much in line with Jewish tradition and the season of
Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur that we're heading into,'' Menitoff
said. ``It certainly added in my eyes to his credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Other clergy, however, voiced a more mixed response. The Rev.
John Buehrens, president of the Unitarian-Universalist Association,
said Clinton's remarks were ``a very sincere and heartfelt
confession.'' But Buehrens said he still felt deeply concerned
about ``the misuse of power'' evident in Clinton's having had a
relationship ``with a very young subordinate.''
</P>
<P>
   Some also offered praise for Hillary Clinton's conduct in the
face of the scandal. Ms. Campbell said she told the first lady she
had been ``wonderfully strong.'' Mrs. Clinton, she said, replied,
```Not always.'''

   ``It's not going to get any prettier as the day goes on,'' Tom
Brokaw said around 2:45 Friday afternoon, a little more than an
hour into NBC's marathon on-air reporting of details from
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   NBC was the first of the broadcast networks on the air (by about
10 minutes) and stayed on the longest, but all three networks as
well as the 24-hour cable channels jumped on the report, even as
they struggled to communicate its details to the public without
uttering words that might offend their audiences. Correspondents
read from photocopies and computer screens, censoring the explicit
details as they went along, embracing euphemisms as they tangled
with the English language and public acceptability.
</P>
<P>
   For days, there had been a drumbeat of warnings about the
seaminess of sexual detail to come. But Friday's coverage was
marked by a new sense of seriousness and balance. The tone was
almost funereal, and there were constant reminders that Starr's
report is one-sided. And there were many disclaimers that the
sexual details are crucial to Starr's charges of perjury against
the president.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's an enormous amount of graphic language'' in the Starr
report, Peter Jennings warned on ABC. The details could be found on
the Internet, where the entire report would be posted, he said, but
viewers would not hear that language on his network. Similar
warnings that this material was not family-friendly came from Dan
Rather on CBS, from Brokaw (carried on both MSNBC and its 24-hour
channel MSNBC) and from the 24-hour cable channels CNN and Fox News
Channel.
</P>
<P>
   On CBS, Bob Schieffer looked profoundly embarrassed as he read
cold from the report.
</P>
<P>
   NBC and CNN reported that the ``semen stain'' on Ms. Lewinsky's
famous dress matched the president's DNA. But generally, the
correspondents' language was more discreet than that of the Starr
report. CBS's Scott Pelley referred to ``a love note of a sexually
explicit nature'' from Monica Lewinsky to the president, and Lisa
Myers of NBC said the note referred to the film ``Titanic'' and
suggested ``a particular kind of sex.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN sometimes went farther than the others. Candy Crowley sat at
a computer screen, with the report visible to television viewers.
Once, after issuing what she called ``our usual cautionary tale,''
she read one of the most explicit passages out loud.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days a seesaw battle for television coverage between
the Starr and Clinton camps has developed. In the morning all the
networks carried the president's appearance at a prayer breakfast,
when he said, ``I don't think there is a fancy way to say that I
have sinned.'' That instantly became the soundbite of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   The networks broke in several times during the day. NBC and CBS
covered the House of Representatives' vote to release the Starr
report; all three networks covered the rebuttals by Clinton's
lawyers. But by late afternoon everything else was overwhelmed by
the sheer mass of the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   By evening, Sen. Orin Hatch, R-Utah, one of Clinton's fiercest
critics, appeared on a split screen with an appearance by Hillary
Clinton. Vice-President Al Gore had introduced her, while the
president waited to receive an award from an Irish-American group.
The media battle seemed set to continue through the weekend, not
getting any prettier at all.

<TEXT>
<P>
   With the House of Representatives considering whether to begin
impeachment proceedings against a president for the first time in a
generation, members of Congress are looking to legal and political
history for standards to help them decide whether President
Clinton's conduct amounted to impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   What they are finding is a somewhat vague set of interpretations
of the Constitution's declaration that the chief executive can be
removed for treason, bribery ``or other high crimes and
misdemeanors.'' Because that history does not provide specific
rules for how to evaluate a case against the president, it is
already providing ammunition for both Clinton's critics and his
defenders.
</P>
<P>
   Many legal experts agree, however, that the Constitution and
impeachment efforts since the birth of the United States show that
the phrase ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' is intended to mean
significant abuses of power or challenges to the constitutional
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to qualify as a `high crime and misdemeanor,'
presidential conduct has to be established that amounts to an
assault on the constitutional foundation of the Republic,'' said
Bruce Ackerman, a professor of law and political science at Yale
University who has written about impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase ``high crimes and misdemeanors,'' several historians
said, was in use in England and colonial America to refer to
official offenses for which high government officials could be
brought to account. They said that the phrase did not mean minor
breaches of the law as the modern meaning of the term misdemeanor
would suggest.
</P>
<P>
   In their rebuttal to Starr's report Friday, Clinton's lawyers
focused on that issue. In the Constitution, high crimes and
misdemeanors meant ``wrongs committed against our system of
government,'' the rebuttal said. Impeachment, it said, ``was never
designed to allow a political body to force a president from office
for a very personal mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   It is equally clear, however, that impeachment is a political
process, even though it includes many elements of the legal system.
In the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton said impeachable
offenses ``are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be
denominated POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to injuries done
immediately to society itself.''
</P>
<P>
   But because impeachment is a political process, some legal
experts say, the definition of what might constitute high crimes
and misdemeanors might change over time. ``Alexander Hamilton would
plainly say to you that what (FM)high crimes and misdemeanors'
means depends on what the Congress says in the political context of
1998,'' said Eric Freedman, a professor at Hofstra University
School of Law.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are strong opinions on the subject, there is no
clear answer as to whether private sexual conduct, or even perjury
or obstruction of justice to cover-up an embarrassing relationship,
could be described as a high crime or misdemeanor within the
meaning of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The sentiment that ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' should be
flexibly defined was expressed most famously by Rep. Gerald R. Ford
in 1970. Seeking to begin impeachment proceedings against Supreme
Court Justice William O. Douglas, the Michigan congressman and
future president said that ``an impeachable offense is basically
whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to
be at a given moment in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal scholars say that abbreviated explanation has been widely
misunderstood. They say it correctly reflects that the process is
intended to be political.
</P>
<P>
   But most experts on impeachment say the Congress is bound by an
understanding that has evolved over several centuries that there
are strict limits on the Congress' use of the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expectation is Congress will rise above everyday politics
and render a constitutional decision and that means the process
does not exist simply to vindicate political whims,'' said Michael
Gerhardt, a professor at William and Mary School of Law in
Williamsburg, Va. and the author of a book on impeachment law.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they were reading Starr's report Friday, members of the
House, which acts as the indicting body, were grappling with what
legal standard to apply. If the House charged Clinton, the Senate
would be called upon to rule on the charges. A two thirds vote in
the Senate would be required to remove Clinton from the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Among members of the House Judiciary Committee on Friday, there
was spirited discussion of what constitiutes an impeachable
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you this, it is not whatever we say it is. We are
constrained by the precedents'' said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a Democratic
member of the Judiciary Committee.

 UNDATED: Judiciary Committee.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Other members said they thought the test was whether there were
any violations by the president that might suggest that a failure
to punish him would leave the appearance that Clinton was above the
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think perjury is `high crimes and misdemeanors,' but people
are all over the board on that,'' said Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C., a
member of the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   There are few precedents to guide the discussion. Since 1789,
when the Constitution went into effect, the House has voted to
impeach just sixteen officials.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that sparse collection of cases and a few abortive
impeachment drives have established certain governing principles. A
failed effort to remove Supreme Court Justice Samuel Chase in 1804
is often cited by legal experts as establishing the principle that
impeachment is not to be used to remove officials with whom
Congress has mere policy differences.
</P>
<P>
   And the Senate's failure by a single vote to remove President
Andrew Johnson in 1868 has come to stand for the proposition that
impeachment is not a device by which Congress can remove an
unpopular president.
</P>
<P>
   Although the battle to oust Johnson centered on his power to
control the membership of his Cabinet, many historians say the
motive of many in Congress was fury at the president's
Reconstruction policies toward the South.
</P>
<P>
   In anguished speeches at the time and in decisions some of them
published subsequently, senators of 1868 said the Johnson
impeachment was a test of whether the independent presidency could
survive.
</P>
<P>
   That analysis was reinforced by scholars and congressional
lawyers during the Watergate investigation of President Richard M.
Nixon a century later.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Holtzman, a former congresswoman from New York who was
a House Judiciary Committee member then, remembered Friday that she
and other members of Congress at the time studied the history of
earlier impeachment battles and the writings of the drafters of the
Constitution. They were convinced, she said, that they were bound
to follow the principles that evolved through history, even if
those principles were loose enough to leave open vast territory for
interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   The question before members of Congress now, Ms. Holtzman said,
is not simply whether they disapprove of Clinton's actions. ``They
have an obligation to understand what the Constitution means,'' Ms.
Holtzman said. ``It's not a question of opinion.''

   JAPANESE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO SHRINK
</P>
<P>
   In the starkest sign so far of the depth of Japan's recession,
the government said that the economy contracted in the
April-to-June quarter by an annual rate of 3.3 percent, nearly
twice as steep a fall as most economists had expected. It was the
first time Japan's economy had contracted for three consecutive
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The data suggest that the core of the economy slid even more
rapidly than it did earlier in the year, and there are fears that
the recession could worsen. The figures were released after the
close of a volatile session in Japanese stocks. The Nikkei index
plunged 749.05 points, or 5.11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ECONOMIC SHIFT INDICATED IN RUSSIA
</P>
<P>
   Handily winning a confirmation vote in the Russian Parliament,
Prime Minister Yevgeni Primakov signaled a sharp shift toward a
more socialist economic model by endorsing two of the Communist
Party's hand-picked candidates for top posts, including the head of
the Central Bank. Primakov gave no details of his economic program
but invoked the New Deal as an example of the measured use of
government intervention to rescue a country from economic
depression.
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN EXPRESS RESISTING TURMOIL
</P>
<P>
   American Express, seeking to stem a 41 percent drop in its stock
since mid-July, said the turmoil in emerging markets and signs that
the U.S. economy was slowing were having only a modest effect on
earnings. Its shares rose $8.875, to $78.375.
</P>
<P>
   TOSHIBA TO POST FIRST-HALF LOSS
</P>
<P>
   Toshiba said that it would report a loss for the fiscal first
half _ its first for the period in 48 years _ because of plunging
memory-chip prices, slumping Asian demand and foundering sales of
personal computers and peripheral products. The company said it
expected a loss of 25 billion yen, or $191 million, in the half
ending on Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER PRICES FELL IN AUGUST
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department said that producer prices _ prices paid to
factories, farmers and other producers of goods _ decreased 0.4
percent in August, their largest drop in seven months, indicating
that falling commodity prices are holding inflation at bay. The
decline in prices was the largest since January's drop of 0.6
percent and the sixth monthly decrease this year.
</P>
<P>
   POSSIBLE DELAY IN MICROSOFT TRIAL
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers from Microsoft and the Justice Department have
tentatively agreed to push the date of the company's antitrust
trial back to Oct. 15 from Sept. 23. The possible delay was
negotiated after a hearing on Microsoft's request to have the suit
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   HOMESTAKE REVISES BUYOUT OFFER
</P>
<P>
   Homestake Mining and Prime Resources Group have agreed to a
revised bid for Homestake to buy the 49.4 percent of Prime it does
not own, increasing the transaction's value to $330 million.
</P>
<P>
   COFFEE FUTURES DECLINE 4.4 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   Coffee futures dived 4.4 percent amid fears that Brazil will
devalue its currency, prompting a wave of selling. In New York,
coffee for December delivery fell 4.85 cents, to $1.0415 a pound.

DIVERS FIND 2D RECORDER FROM SWISSAIR 111  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ After battling heavy seas for the better
part of the week, divers late Friday made a breakthrough in the
investigation of the Swissair Flight 111 crash, retrieving the
cockpit voice recorder from the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The recorder monitors conversation between pilots inside the
cockpit, and the tape may shed more light on the final moments of
the jetliner before it crashed into the ocean on the night of Sept.
2, killing all 229 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the material on the tape can be compared with sounds from
the jetliner's flight data recorder, which was fished from the
Atlantic on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks very hopeful,'' said Jim Harris, spokesman for the
Transportation Safety Board of Canada, the main agency
investigating the crash. ``By finding both flight recorders, we
might get to the cause of the accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon its return to land, the recorder was stored in a box of
fresh water to help preserve it, then placed aboard a plane headed
to the Canadian capital, Ottawa. Both boxes will be examined at the
safety board's engineering laboratory there, and specialists say it
may take two days to obtain a summary.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they were unsure of the form in which that
summary would be released; unlike the United States, Canada
routinely does not disclose transcripts from cockpit voice
recorders, to protect the privacy of pilots.
</P>
<P>
   The cockpit recorder was recovered from 180 feet of water by
divers operating from the Canadian Forces ship Gramby, said Tony
Blom, communications direcor of the Canadian safety board.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery was made about 6 p.m. local time in waters off the
fishing village of Peggy's Cove, officials said. It follows days of
frustration when Canadian Forces ships picked up signals from the
recorder on the ocean floor but could not locate the sealed box.
</P>
<P>
   If it functions, the recorder could provide the last 30 minutes
of conversation between the crew and the air traffic controllers,
as well as among the crew members. The tape also should report
sounds such as emergency alarms, said Harris.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it works, it will be a great asset. But if it doesn't, we
will have to fall back to what we know,'' said Harris.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder, which already is being analyzed, could
tell investigators how the aircraft's hydraulics and other systems
were working, officials say. The flight recorder measures the
plane's mechanical data, including its speed.
</P>
<P>
   However, the flight recorder stopped recording data after the
plane descended to 10,000 feet, and there are indications of a
general electrical failure aboard the jetliner at that time. It is
likely that information from the second recorder may also end at
that time, specialists say. The pilots, seeking an emergency
landing, lost contact with air controllers six minutes before the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   The latest discovery came a day after divers recovered human
remains on the ocean bottom near the spot where the Geneva-bound
MD-11 aircraft crashed. So far, only four of the victims have been
identified.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery came hours after scores of reporters on the scene
for more than a week had departed from Halifax and as the
government was closing down a media center.

RELIGION COLUMN: EPISCOPAL BISHOPS PLAY DOWN IMPACT OF VOTE ON
HOMOSEXUALITY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Lambeth Conference, the once-a-decade meeting of the world's
Anglican bishops that took place in England earlier this summer,
had several themes, not least of which was the opportunity for
bishops from places as far apart as Alaska and Zimbabwe to meet and
confer.
</P>
<P>
   But if there was an issue that seemed to dominate news of the
conference, it was what the nearly 800 bishops would say about
homosexuality and the church, a question answered when they
overwhelmingly voted to reject homosexual practice as
``incompatible with Scripture.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the vote was tallied, Bishop Richard Grein, spiritual
leader of the Episcopal Church's Diocese of New York, knew that the
resolution, although advisory, would hit hard in his jurisdiction,
where many Episcopal priests and lay people _ some gay and some not
_ would sharply disagree with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was an awful lot of anxiety in our diocese and
our gay and lesbian community, with regard to the action taken at
Lambeth,'' said Grein, who attended the conference and is a leading
prelate in the 2.4 million-member Episcopal Church, which is one of
the 37 church provinces within the global Anglican Communion.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Grein and his eventual successor in New York,
Bishop Mark Sisk, sat down shortly before Labor Day to write a
pastoral letter to the 62,000 Episcopalians in their flock, to tell
them essentially that nothing had changed.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they acknowledged, the resolution had ``caused much hurt
and anger among faithful people,'' but the bishops added that they
wanted it understood that ``the character of our life together'' as
New York Episcopalians would remain the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``This diocese,'' they wrote, ``has long recognized and
treasured the ministry of gay and lesbian Episcopalians in New
York, and of course, the ministry of our gay and lesbian clergy.''
</P>
<P>
   Their letter was not the only statement taking issue with the
resolution, nor was it the first. The day after the resolution was
passed, Episcopal Bishop Ronald Haines of Washington composed a
briefer and more general statement, addressed to gay Anglicans,
which said, in part, ``We pledge that we will continue to reflect,
pray and work for your full inclusion in the life of the church.''
(Although the statement noted that Anglicans worldwide disagreed
over what ``full inclusion'' would mean, it called on them to hold
a ``prayerful, respectful conversation'' about homosexuality.)
</P>
<P>
   As of this week, the letter had been signed by 162 bishops from
around the world, according to a copy sent from Bishop Haines'
office.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, after the letter had arrived in New
York parishes, both Grein and Sisk said they thought it had been
well received.
</P>
<P>
   Grein said the diocese has never made much of an issue out of
the sexual orientation of its candidates for priesthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a question we do not ask in the ordination process,''
he said. ``We look for strengths and gifts and leadership
abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also said that in writing their letter as a response to
the Lambeth resolution, both he and Sisk had not wanted a
confrontational approach.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, their letter declares that both men will take
``leading roles'' in trying to talk about issues relating to
homosexuality with Anglican bishops who take different views from
their own.
</P>
<P>
   In the process of trying to find some common ground, Grein said,
``you don't do yourself any favors by making adversaries.'' It
would be a conversation, the bishop said, that he expected would
last many years.

DISNEY EXPECTS QUARTERLY EARNINGS TO MISS EXPECTATIONS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mickey Mouse has caught the Asian flu.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment giant Walt Disney Co. announced Friday that it
expects its profits for the fourth quarter ending Sept. 30 to come
in at 15 or 16 cents a share _ well under Wall Street estimates of
21 cents a share and year-ago earnings of 19 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have been cutting estimates for several months, most
often citing weakness in Asian markets, and Disney stock has fallen
39 percent since peaking in early May.
</P>
<P>
   Disney, which released the announcement after the market closed,
blamed weak demand in foreign markets for consumer products and
home videos; declines in its movies and at its ABC television
network; and start-up costs for new ventures such as its cruise
line and DisneyQuest play parks. It said results will improve at
theme parks and its ESPN cable sports network.
</P>
<P>
   Disney also said it will take a charge of 2 cents a share to cut
operations in movies to reflect previously announced cuts in
production of live-action films to 15 annually, and in its consumer
products division, where it has ceased operation of the DisneyFest
traveling attraction in Asia. &QL;

<P>
   Collectors of sports memorabilia were already having a difficult
time finding Mark McGwire mementos before Tuesday night, when the
St. Louis slugger hit his 62nd home run, surpassing Roger Maris'
record for home runs in a season.
</P>
<P>
   After all, McGwire has turned down commercial ventures to sell
his autograph, though he signs for fans before most games.
</P>
<P>
   Now the demand far exceeds the supply. Nearly everything related
to the 62nd home run is already at the National Baseball Hall of
Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, N.Y.: the bat, the ball and
McGwire's hat, jersey, pants, cleats and batting gloves. Even the
jersey worn by his son, Matthew, is on display.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, there's not much of anything
available,'' said Dave Jarvis, co-owner of Megacards, a sports
memorabilia shop in St. Louis. ``Anything Mark McGwire is going
fast. I had a couple of autographed bats that weren't even used in
games. They were $300. Now they're $500. A game-used bat would be
$2,000 at least.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis and other St. Louis collectors gave rough prices for
``game-worn'' material _ if available _ related to any McGwire home
run this year. A full Cardinals uniform would be $5,000; his size
13 spikes, $1,000, and a shinguard he wears on his left leg, $200.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any home-run ball from this year would be worth several
hundred dollars,'' Jarvis said. ``After No. 50, it's $25,000 or
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Collectors have turned to just about any other scrap of the
historic night. Commemorative editions of The St. Louis
Post-Dispatch are selling for $40, unused scorecards for $50,
unused tickets for $200 or more.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's rookie baseball card _ Topps 1985, No. 401 _ is listed
in the latest monthly guides at $150 but, at least for now, is
selling at $250.
</P>
<P>
   But buyers beware: Forged McGwire material is being sold in
stores and on the World Wide Web. The Missouri attorney general
recently settled two lawsuits contending that merchants were
selling fake McGwire bats, baseballs and caps.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has warned fans to be careful. ``What upsets me is that
people are spending their hard-earned money on something that's
fake,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even his mother ran across a photograph of him that featured a
bogus autograph. ``You know this is a forgery,'' he said she told
the owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `No, it's not,' and she says: `Yes, it is. That's
my son and I know my son's signature.' ''

EVERNHAM THE WIZARD BEHIND THE BOY WONDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY D. BOGGS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ray Evernham, one of the best and most competitive crew chiefs
on the NASCAR Winston Cup circuit, knows how to relax.
</P>
<P>
   Take the night before last weekend's Pepsi Southern 500 at
Darlington (S.C.) Raceway. After attending a benefit with his wife,
the 41-year-old wizard behind Jeff Gordon's No. 24 Chevrolet Monte
Carlo fell asleep on the bed around 10 _ shop notes beside him, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up around 1 and have been awake ever since,'' Evernham
said after Gordon won his 10th victory this season.
</P>
<P>
   Evernham probably hasn't slept much since as he prepares for
tonight's Exide NASCAR Select Batteries 400 at Richmond (Va.)
International Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can survive on two or three hours of sleep a day,'' Evernham
said. ``I think I'm really competitive, sometimes unhealthy
competitive. I think if you're going to lead a group, it's very
important to be competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   But he can relax.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ride my motorcycle, I spend time with my wife and my
\R7-year-old\S son,'' he said. ``I like to come home to sit on my
own back porch, cook a steak, play with my dog, watch my son. I
don't really need a lot. I really enjoy what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of Red Bank, N.J., who grew up and raced in New Jersey,
Evernham built and drove Modified Division cars from 1979 through
1983 and in 1991. But he realized that his forte was not behind the
wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't be a race-car driver, this can be the next-best
thing,'' said Evernham, the NASCAR Winston Cup champion crew chief
in 1995 and 1997. ``If you're a car guy, you can build a machine
and see it accomplish things. I'm fortunate enough to have a great
support group.''
</P>
<P>
   Topping that list is a great driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clicked right from the start,'' said Gordon, who has teamed
with Evernham since the 1991 Busch Grand National season.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Evernham led Gordon to the Winston Cup rookie of the
year title. Winston Cup championships followed in '95 and '97.
</P>
<P>
   Evernham credits most of his success to Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just look at him sometimes in awe,'' Evernham said. ``He's
the master. If you build the best violin, you'd certainly want to
give it to the best violin player. He just does wonders with that
car sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's recent success, however _ he has won seven of the past
nine races _ brought forth allegations of cheating. Jack Roush,
team owner for Mark Martin, a perennial runner-up to Gordon,
suggested that Evernham might be illegally ``soaking'' tires,
resulting in better grip and thus an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Evernham's competitiveness really showed. After
Gordon won the Farm Aid on CMT 300 on Aug. 30, Roush and Evernham
engaged in a postrace shouting match over the ``soaking''
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prayed very hard to have the strength to stay about that
level and not make an idiot of myself,'' Evernham said. ``I guess I
said a couple of things I shouldn't have said. It upset my son. I
think that's what bothered me the most. That's what got Jack
whacked when my son was upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Evernham said he hasn't spoken to Roush and doesn't expect to.
As long as he can maintain his relationship with Martin and crew
chief Jimmy Fennig _ ``That friendship remains intact,'' Evernham
said _ all is well.
</P>
<P>
   And what about cheating?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't break rules,'' Evernham said. ``It's not what I'm
about. We're going to do this right and feel good about it.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Save your Aussie money _ the South Pacific island
will rise again.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Australian dollar is that lovable: 48 cents against
its US counterpart at one point last week. But those olden golden
days when Aussies made American guys feel like nickel-and-dimers at
the game of tennis may have returned at the US Open. Ambling into
view this afternoon as a couple of characters in a sporting remake
of ``The Way We Were'' are Patrick Rafter and Mark Philippoussis,
who seem to have been fast-forwarded from someplace between 1951
and 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward is definitely their ethic. Rafter and
Philippoussis, rushing headlong to establish beachheads at the net,
are emulating the bygone heroes of their bedtime stories about an
era when Australia turned out tennis players like Kenneth Starr
piling up accusations _ most of them just as damaging.
</P>
<P>
   Their raining terror on the US Championships started with Frank
Sedgman winning the titles of 1951-52 and continued through Kenny
Rosewall, Mal Anderson, Ashley Cooper, Neale Fraser, Roy Emerson,
Rod Laver, Fred Stolle, and John Newcombe _ 15 titles in 23 years,
a torrent of seven straight as Laver completed his first Grand Slam
in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the way of today at Flushing Meadow. But Rafter,
risking his crown opposite the acquisitive four-time king _ Pete
Sampras _ and Philippoussis, up against Carlos Moya, are the Charge
of the Light Brigade in short trousers, oblivious to the perils of
the passing-shot cannoneers. Not since 1974 (Newcombe and Rosewall)
has an antipodean pair been in the semis.
</P>
<P>
   Serve-and-volley, chip-and-charge _ attack, attack, attack ...
and keep the change. That's the mode of these two big spenders of
spectacular, high-energy points. However, that's where the
similarity, besides passports, ends.
</P>
<P>
   If you are an Australian hostess, you don't invite both Patrick
and Mark to your party. No palace is roomy enough for both of them
because at home, Rafter is the Good Aussie and Philippoussis the
Bad Aussie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very young; I'm still learning,'' says 21-year-old
Philippoussis. A good kid with bad judgement, he committed a huge
public relations double fault in January, alienating virtually
every inhabitant of his continent, aside from a few indifferent
wombats and emus. By declining to play Davis Cup for the homeland,
he committed a grievous sin. Fault 1.
</P>
<P>
   This is Benedict Arnold-style behavior Down Under, where the Cup
is a holier grail than even a beer keg. Sampras ducks duty in the
US but he wouldn't get away with it unscathed in an underpopulated
land where pride in conquering the world on a tennis court is
fierce.
</P>
<P>
   Then Fault 2: Philippoussis, who'd said he needed time off,
curiously showed up, anyway, as a telecaster at the Aussies'
initial encounter, an unthinkable upset by Zimbabwe in Australia,
lost largely because Rafter was ill. Had Philippoussis played, no
problem. But Mark, babbling in the booth rather than routinely
bombing 125-mile-per-hour serves on the nearby court, became a
marked man.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight he was ``Sillypoussis'' in the papers, tagged with
numerous adjectives, of which ``unpatriotic'' was probably the
kindest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Livid'' was probably the gentlest describing the reaction of
team captain and national icon Newcombe, the last Aussie (1973)
until Rafter last year to rule the US. Philippoussis had hoped to
play later in the season, the relegation contest against Uzbekistan
(likely unlosable even if Newk himself, 54, has to play). His
response: ``This is a team proposition, and you're either on or off
at the start. Check in next year.''
</P>
<P>
   The gargantuan Philippoussis, 6 feet 4 inches and serving
meteorically, hasn't helped his reputation by ``going flash,'' as
it's said. Tootling about modestly in a yellow Lamborghini and
exhibiting other trappings of wealth, the world No. 22 couldn't
help but look bad alongside the sweating striver, No. 3 Rafter, one
of nine children. A ``dinkum (regular guy) Aussie,'' with a dread
of expanded head syndrome, Patrick says, ``I just want to remain
the same bag of (expletive) I've always been.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A recent poll,'' says Geoff Pollard, president of Tennis
Australia, ``has shown Pat to be the best-known and most popular
person in our country, not just among sportsmen. What an asset he
is to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   In this Good/Bad morality play, Rafter, after complaining he was
``tired of the game,'' ironically lifted off early last year as a
last-minute Davis Cup replacement for an injured Philippoussis.
Cup-holding France was the foe, and Cedric Pioline jumped Rafter to
take a two-set lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed that win, needed Pat to start competing,'' recalls
Newcombe. ``I looked him in the eye and said, `Pat, this is a war
of attrition!' Damned if he didn't play as never before, won it in
five, and we were on our way _ us to the semis, he to the US title.
I felt pretty pleased that what I said had sunk in.
</P>
<P>
   ``But later,'' he laughs, ``Pat said to me, `Newk, what does
attrition mean?'''
</P>
<P>
   It's attrition time again. Newk likes the way Rafter escaped
from opening-round ignominy in the lefthanded form of the gifted
tiny Moroccan, Hicham Arazi. After getting stomped by Arazi for the
first two sets, Rafter ruthlessly won 15 of the next 16 in his five
victories.
</P>
<P>
   But Philippoussis ``also showed me some heart in the quarters,''
says Newcombe, ``the way he threw himself all over the place to
beat that tough little Swede (Tom Johansson) from three match
points down in the fifth-set tie-breaker.''
</P>
<P>
   For Australians stranded on the isle they call Oz _ from Sydney
to Perth, Port Darwin to Adelaide _ their all-night telly vigil,
commencing at 2 a.m., will be merely euphoric if their Good and Bad
boys both come through. An intramural final would return them to a
time when such were almost customary. Over one particularly
devastating stretch of the tourists' beastly treatment of their
hosts, there were 10 exclusives between 1956 and the most recent,
1970, Rosewall over Tony Roche. Even though well loved in the US,
the Aussies did tend to overdo.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's Philippoussis's shot at painting himself Good, Rafter's
at attaining a shade of Gooder. Should the Bad Aussie go all the
way _ ``He could; I remember too well how he totally overpowered me
two years ago at the Australian,'' says Sampras _ the folks at home
will gratefully line up to wash and wax his yellow Lamborghini.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Monica Lewinsky told investigators that Vernon
Jordan, a top Washington lawyer and longtime confidant of President
Clinton, directed her to destroy evidence of her relationship with
Clinton, according to the Starr report made public Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's voluminous report, which is laced with references to
Jordan, draws no conclusion about Jordan's conduct. But it paints a
portrait of Jordan as swept up in the Lewinsky melodrama in part
because Ms. Lewinsky assumed with ``a wink and a nod'' that Jordan
was fully aware of her sexual relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jordan testified under oath that both Clinton and Ms.
Lewinsky lied to him and told him they were not sexually involved,
Jordan suspected they were, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in love, that's what your problem is,'' Jordan told Ms.
Lewinsky last December, after she had complained to him that she
got angry at the president ``when he doesn't call me enough or see
me enough.'' Jordan advised the former White House intern to take
her frustrations out on him rather than on Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   And several days later, Ms. Lewinsky is quoted as saying to the
investigators, after she had been subpoenaed in the Paula Jones
case, he advised Ms. Lewinsky to throw out copies of notes that she
had written to the president. She was afraid that her erstwhile
friend, Linda Tripp, had seen them.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to Ms. Lewinsky, Jordan said: `Go home and make sure
they're not there,''' the report said. ``Ms. Lewinsky testified
that she understood that Jordan was advising her to `throw ...
away' any copies or drafts of notes that she had sent to the
President,'' the report said. It said Ms. Lewinsky then went home
and threw out copies of approximately 50 notes she had written to
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his investigation over the last several months,
Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, has been trying to
determine if Jordan had asked Ms. Lewinsky to lie under oath about
her relationship with the president. He has emphatically denied
that he asked her to do so. Neither he nor his lawyer, William
Hundley, were available Friday for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, a fixture in the Washington legal and social
establishment and a presidential golfing buddy who has boasted that
his bond with Clinton allows for ``a little locker-room talk,''
testified that Clinton lied to him directly about his relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan told investigators that after Ms. Lewinsky received a
subpoena last fall in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case and
appeared in Jordan's office in a highly emotional state, he
subsequently met with the president and asked him point blank
whether he had ever had sexual relations with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, never,'' the president told him, according to Jordan's
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 22 in a public statement, Jordan told reporters
``absolutely and unequivocally'' that Ms. Lewinsky had denied to
him that she was involved with the president.
</P>
<P>
   But the report indicates that Jordan suspected that the
relationship might be sexual because Ms. Lewinsky was so openly
upset in his office and because of clues from Ms. Lewinsky. For
example, she asked Jordan if Clinton was likely to stay married to
Hillary Rodham Clinton. He told prosecutors that Ms. Lewinsky
seemed ``mesmerized'' by the president. And when Ms. Lewinsky left
his office, she asked Jordan to ``give the president a hug'' for
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't have to be Einstein'' to figure out they were
probably involved, Jordan told investigators.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While the report indicates that both the president and Ms.
Lewinsky lied to Jordan, it also says he actively tried to find her
a job only after she had been subpoenaed _ suggesting that Jordan
wanted to protect the president and buy Ms. Lewinsky's silence.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that in October 1997, Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky
discussed enlisting Jordan in a job search because she wanted to
work in the private sector and he was so well connected, sitting on
the boards of numerous corporations. Ms. Lewinsky met Jordan on
Nov. 5 and came ``highly recommended,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence indicates, though, that Jordan took no steps to
help Ms. Lewinsky until early December, after she appeared on the
witness list in the Jones case,'' the report stated.
</P>
<P>
   She was subpoenaed Dec. 19, and went to see Jordan, in tears,
brandishing the subpoena. At some point, Jordan asked her if she
was involved with Clinton. She testified that ``at this time she
assumed that Jordan knew with a wink and a nod that she was having
a relationship with the president,'' the report said. ``She
therefore interpreted Jordan's questions as `What are you going to
say?' rather than `What are the actual answers?'''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan met that night with the president and told him, at Ms.
Lewinsky's request, that she had been subpoenaed. The president
testified that he did not exactly recall the conversation, but that
he remembered telling Jordan: ``there was no sexual relationship
between me and Monica Lewinsky, which was true.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan then secured Ms. Lewinsky a job with Revlon, contacting
Ronald Perelman, the New York financier whose company has a
majority interest in the cosmetics company. When she accepted the
job in January, Jordan called the president and said, ``Mission
accomplished.'' The company withdrew the offer after the Starr
investigation became public.

A GROWTH SPURT FOR UNION SQUARE PARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Having been transformed from a haven for drug dealers
into a verdant jewel in a resurgent neighborhood, Union Square Park
is about to undergo its next big transformation: a doubling of its
size by turning adjacent pavement into parkland.
</P>
<P>
   The city plan, to be presented to Community Board 5 on Monday
evening, calls for the Manhattan park to be expanded by 50 to 130
feet on its west side and 10 to 20 feet to the south. A traffic
triangle at the southeast corner will be nearly tripled in size to
20,000 square feet to accommodate traffic. When funds are available
in the future, the rest of the ellipse-shaped park will be expanded
so that it will resemble more of an actual square.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a park in transition,'' said Parks Commissioner Henry
Stern. ``Just as you wouldn't recognize the park of 20 years ago
today, in 20 years you will no longer be able to recognize today's
park.''
</P>
<P>
   The once-decrepit park is already considered a major success
story of urban revitalization, having helped draw new housing,
glittering stores and restaurants and thousands upon thousands of
visitors to what was a dowdy factory and retailing area little more
than a decade ago. And as the local economy has improved, local
businesses have taken on more of the job of caring for the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Union Square is a classic example of how fixing up a park can
make a dramatic change in the surrounding neighborhood,'' said
Marcia Reiss, policy director for the Parks Council, a nonprofit
research and advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Richard, president of the electronics retailer P.C. Richard
&AMP; Son, which three years ago opened its first Manhattan store in
the area, said, ``It gets better every day.'' Referring to the park
and the surrounding business district, he said, ``There's life all
over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, Union Square was not originally, and never has been
officially, mapped as parkland. In 1832, the state Legislature
acquired it as ``a public space,'' and as such, it was intended
principally to be the place where the roads and people of a growing
metropolis intersected. Indeed, its name owed nothing to its
historical importance as a meeting place for organized labor, but
rather denoted the union of two roads, the Albany Post Road (now
Broadway) and Boston Road (now Fourth Avenue).
</P>
<P>
   But in their relentless search for a bit of open space, New
Yorkers made Union Square a park in the truest sense. In part, the
irregular oval from 14th Street to 17th Street cutting across
Broadway became a stage for history: People gathered there to
celebrate the end of the Civil War, to mourn the deaths of Lincoln
and Grant and to protest the executions of Sacco and Vanzetti.
</P>
<P>
   But Union Square _ which is to be designated a National Landmark
on Saturday in honor of its importance to labor _ was also a place
for the smaller, more tender turnings of the urban drama. In the
1960s, it had a program to provide day care for shoppers at 25
cents an hour _ called ``Check a Child'' _ and today, the park's
three playgrounds sizzle with nonstop youthful energy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the public space's ambiguous legal definition, New
Yorkers have always insisted that it must first and foremost be a
park _ and it has changed forms many times. Frederick Law Olmsted
and Calvert Vaux, the designers of Central Park, performed the
first make-over in the 1870s, and in the 1930s it was raised four
feet to make room for a subway mezzanine. The administration of
Mayor Edward Koch remodeled it in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Though parks officials are reluctant to give details of the
latest plans before presenting them to the local community board,
designers say that park visitors can expect antique bishop's-crook
lampposts, granite-block and bluestone paving, and ample new
plantings of flowers, shrubs and trees.
</P>
<P>
   But the main focus is expansion. ``We're expanding the park at
all sides below 15th Street,'' said Lawrence Mauro, a landscape
architect who is serving as project manager. He says future plans
include new restrooms as part of a full-scale restoration of the
crumbling limestone structure at the park's northern edge.
</P>
<P>
   The current project involves two phases. The first is the
expansion and beautification of the southwestern corner of the park
at a cost of $2.2 million, to be paid from the city's capital
budget. The other is the increase in size of the traffic triangle
to 21,000 square feet from 6,900 square feet to handle traffic
better. Those changes, to cost $400,000, will be paid for by the
Metropolitan Transit Authority.
</P>
<P>
   A major goal is to give clean definition to the perimeter of the
park, which has been marked by temporary curbs and other barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Two local business groups, the 14th Street Local Development
Corp. and the 14th Street Business Improvement District, are
responsible for improvements in park maintenance. They have
provided help with sanitation, security and groundskeeping.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most notable feature of the park is the Union
Square Greenmarket, which has become one of the city's biggest
markets for fresh produce. When it started, in 1976, conditions
were sharply different.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no benches, no lawns, no working fountains,'' said
Joel Patraker, assistant director of the market. He said it was not
uncommon for drug addicts to topple farmers' tables and steal money
from the cash boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 70 sellers come four days a week to peddle 200 varieties of
hot peppers, 100 varieties of apples and many other products. The
farmers plant flowers and shrubs around the statue of Mohandas K.
Gandhi and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gardens have never looked better,'' Patraker said.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 13)  
 (af)  
 By JAMES A. ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's 9 a.m., and rumor central is abuzz.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks north of the New York Stock Exchange, the gossip in
chief, Charles Payne, is busy orchestrating a barrage of faxes and
calls, putting out the word to subscribers of his tip sheet and
stock-picking service, Wall Street Strategies.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone lines are alive with the stuff that the brokers,
day traders and institutional investors who pay Payne's bills
crave: Tips on future mergers and stocks that seem ready to fly.
</P>
<P>
   The rumor business is booming for Payne. More than 5,000 eager
subscribers _ hankering for any tidbit that might make a stock
squiggle _ will pay his company a total of $3 million this year for
the goods.
</P>
<P>
   The growing reputation of his service as a clearinghouse for
Street skinny has brought Payne, 35, a fair amount of celebrity.
Financial news cable networks call him regularly for on-camera
appearances, making him perhaps the most visible stock picker since
Dan Dorfman, the onetime USA Today and Money magazine columnist.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could get him on every week, I would,'' said Susan
Feltman, a senior producer of personal-finance call-in shows for
CNNfn, who uses Payne regularly and who handled Dorfman's
appearances on CNN in the mid-1980s. ``The minute he's on, the
phone banks light up, and all 20 lines don't go dead until he's
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a former stockbroker who started his market
newsletter eight years ago out of a one-bedroom Harlem apartment,
and who until a month ago toiled in a cramped office that most Wall
Street media stars wouldn't use as a cloakroom.
</P>
<P>
   In the stock market, of course, gossip can be lifeblood. The
seven-year bull market engendered a gold-rush mentality in some
investors, a headlong, caution-to-the-wind chase after quick gains
that recent slides in the market may, if anything, have
intensified.
</P>
<P>
   Such an environment, the thinking goes, turns the latest gossip,
no matter how speculative, into a precious commodity; the first
people to hear word of a possible deal can quickly take a stake and
secure a profit from the later stampede, regardless of whether the
prophecy comes true. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While there are many broker newsletters, few trade off the
pipeline of whispers quite the way Wall Street Strategies does.
Payne considers his competitors to be companies like Dorsey, Wright
&AMP; Associates and Cabot Money Management, publisher of The Cabot
Market Letter; those companies say they base their stock choices on
technical and fundamental analysis, not rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Stock picks and scuttlebutt have sometimes proved to be
dangerous territory for journalists. The First Amendment's
guarantee of press freedom does not exempt reporters from
Securities and Exchange Commission regulations that prohibit the
use of information to manipulate stocks for personal profit.
</P>
<P>
   High-profile journalists like Dorfman and R. Foster Winans,
formerly of The Wall Street Journal, have suffered career-wrecking
consequences when accusations of manipulation have surfaced. Winans
was convicted in 1985 of trading in stocks he knew were about to
appear in The Journal's Heard on the Street column.
</P>
<P>
   Dorfman was dismissed by Money in January 1996 after declining
to tell editors about his sources for tips he reported about some
stocks. Donald Kessler, a stock promoter and friend of Dorfman, and
six others reported to be connected to the case have pleaded guilty
to federal fraud and tax evasion charges related to stock
manipulation. Regulators have not charged Dorfman with any
wrongdoing and he has said he did nothing improper.
</P>
<P>
   Newsletter publishers and tip service operators have also run
afoul of the SEC Cabot was censured and fined in 1996 for delaying
proper disclosure that it held a substantial stake in a stock,
Presstek Inc., that it had recommended. Cabot agreed to pay the
fines without admitting or denying wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   And Payne's previous employer, a tip service called Traders and
Investors Alert, was shut down in 1989 by New Jersey regulators for
operating as an unregistered investment adviser. Its owner, Barry
K. Davis, was later prosecuted for promoting stocks in which he had
undisclosed positions; he pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges
and served a prison term.
</P>
<P>
   Payne says that he had nothing to do with the activities that
got Davis into trouble, and that he steers clear of conflicts of
interest in his own shop. But he, too, has had a collision with the
SEC.
</P>
<P>
   According to commission documents spelling out the allegations,
a Wall Street Strategies newsletter commented positively about the
stock of the Members Service Corp., a Winter Park, Fla., holding
company, at a time when one of Payne's earliest backers, Todd H.
Moore, a public relations consultant and stock promoter, had a
substantial stake in the company. Members Service ceased operations
in 1994; in 1996, its former chairman and chief executive, Arthur
S. Feher Jr., was convicted of securities fraud involving, among
other things, issuing false press releases to bolster its stock
price.
</P>
<P>
   Payne's newsletter got in hot water after it recommended the
stock of Members Service based on several upbeat announcements
about the company's business prospects that later proved false,
according to an SEC complaint, which also contends that Payne was
paid $70,000 to promote the stock.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Payne says that he did nothing wrong, but that he is in
settlement discussions with the SEC because he wants to avoid
protracted litigation. He contends that all he did was repeat what
had already been reported in the company's news releases. His
lawyer said Payne denies the allegations concerning the $70,000
payment.
</P>
<P>
   Payne says his service processes a lot of gossip but does not
deal in mere hearsay. The majority of tips that come in to his
27-person office are not passed along to clients, Payne said, and
he personally vets the ones that do make the cut, looking for
unusual trading action in the stock or tips from multiple sources.
</P>
<P>
   Payne said he originated most of his stock picks based on market
observations, not tips; only 10 percent, he said, come from
researched rumors.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the rumors that attract attention. Speculative items
about some 40 to 50 deals a week show up in his reports, each
graded with Payne's assessment of the likelihood of its coming
true. (On his scale of 1 to 10, a 5 or 6 means ``food for
thought;'' a 10 means he thinks the ink is all but dry.)
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street Strategies offers the tips, picks and observations
in several packages ranging from a monthly newsletter to
twice-daily faxes to calls alerting subscribers when there is a hot
item to pass along. Fees range from $2,500 to $15,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Payne is proud of some of his more spectacular hits this year.
On Aug. 3, two tips he had given the previous week about takeover
targets panned out: Shares of American Stores, a grocery chain that
announced a deal to be bought by Albertson's, and Stratus Computer,
which said it would be bought by Ascend Communications, both shot
up to the low $30s from the low $20s that Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Payne has also had some stumbles. For example, he added
Sovereign Bancorp to his recommended list several months ago on the
strength of what he thought was a hot takeover rumor, when
Sovereign's stock was trading around $19. But no deal has been
announced, and the stock has languished, closing on Friday at
$12.375.
</P>
<P>
   And in the rapid-fire universe of rumor-driven trading, one
day's star can be the next day's stinker. Payne recommended Mellon
Bank the day before Bank of New York proposed a merger in April,
and Mellon's shares duly rocketed with the announcement. But Mellon
rejected the offer and its stock has now fallen back to $56.4375,
well below the $68 it was fetching when Payne endorsed it.
</P>
<P>
   Payne does the kind of market momentum and technical analysis
that brokers could do themselves if they had time between
cold-calling new clients and hand-holding existing account holders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he does a good job,'' James W. Holloway, managing
editor of Marketscope, a wire service for brokers run by Standard &AMP;
Poor's, said of Payne. Marketscope occasionally calls Payne for
comment on merger talk surrounding stocks. ``I think he's uniquely
positioned in the marketplace, and a number of the rumors he's
passed along have turned out to be correct.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street Strategies says it does not track the overall rate
of return for its stock picks, and its newsletters are not among
those monitored by Hulbert Financial Services, the rating firm. The
sheer volume of tips in Payne's newsletters and the sometimes
cryptic commentary on each complicates any effort to tote up his
score.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the tips Payne was offering clients six months ago. The
March 4 edition of Storyline, Payne's main rumor sheet, included
mention of 123 stocks, some with hard-to-verify remarks attached,
like ``looking for suitor'' or ``sources say building stake.''
</P>
<P>
   The newsletter itself cast a jaundiced eye on some items, saying
a rumor that Johnson &AMP; Johnson was considering acquiring Coca-Cola
Enterprises was ``too weird,'' and acknowledging that a tip that
the Bank of New York was interested in acquiring Suntrust Banks was
based merely on a visit by the Bank of New York's chairman to
Atlanta, where Suntrust is based.
</P>
<P>
   A spot check found that 12 of the companies tipped as takeover
targets in the March 4 newsletter have since announced deals to be
acquired, including Bay Networks, GTE, Long Island Savings Bank and
the Money Store, though the newsletter often was wrong about the
acquirer.
</P>
<P>
   Four more have confirmed they held talks, most notably Circus
Circus Enterprises and Hilton Hotels. By contrast, 13 others tipped
as takeover targets proved instead to be acquirers in deals
announced later, including North Fork Bank and Tellabs. The
remaining hundred-odd tipped acquisitions have failed to
materialize so far.
</P>
<P>
   A lack of performance statistics does not seem to put off the
brokers who subscribe to Payne's service. ``I use him to supplement
what I get from equity research,'' says Myra Nadler, a broker in
Torrance, Calif., referring to analysts at the national brokerage
house where she works.
</P>
<P>
   Payne's company recently moved out of a claustrophobic corner of
the eighth floor at 50 Broad Street into larger quarters at 130
William Street, but half-full packing boxes were still strewn
around the new offices when a reporter arrived more than a week
after the move. And when pandemonium breaks out, often an hour or
so before the market opens, the office quickly becomes a beehive.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Some days, when big news is coming out, it's like the control
tower at O'Hare's United terminal in here,'' Payne said. At such
times, the company's offices are charged with an energy that is
part commodity trading pit, part newsroom at deadline.
</P>
<P>
   While the phones ring off the hook, Payne's staff can be seen
pacing tensely, tethered to phone chords, while he keeps vigil over
a bank of six computer monitors at one end of the room. Payne is
the only one fielding questions and issuing buy or sell
recommendations; his staff is there to field incoming calls from
some subscribers and to place alerting calls to others.
</P>
<P>
   One minute, a broker is on the line looking for the lowdown on a
rumored merger of two blue chips. The next, a reporter from a
business news wire wants the word on talk of a telecommunications
deal. On rare occasions, an anonymous caller at a roadside pay
phone, in a barely audible whisper, is ready to spill some beans.
</P>
<P>
   The business of disseminating stock tips and rumors is largely
unregulated; the main restriction is the SEC ban on market
manipulation. Publicly traded companies are obliged to report
material developments promptly and publicly, but it is generally up
to the exchanges, not the government, to set rules on how they must
do it.
</P>
<P>
   Payne's fast-paced career in the financial markets is a far cry
from his roots. An Army brat early in life, his longest childhood
stay in one place was five years in Harlem's Sugar Hill
neighborhood, during his adolescence in the 1970s. He enrolled at
the High School of Art and Design in Manhattan, but he says he
spent much of his time cutting class and drooling over the
convertibles in the showroom of the Ferrari and Rolls Royce
dealerships on Second Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   He served as a military policeman in the Air Force and completed
a degree in criminal justice at Minot State University in North
Dakota before fulfilling a childhood dream to tote a briefcase to
work by joining E.F. Hutton, in a back-office position verifying
trades.
</P>
<P>
   After brief stints as a broker at several small Manhattan
brokerage firms, Payne landed at Traders and Investors Alert. When
it closed, Payne decided to start Wall Street Strategies, scraping
together $4,000, setting up shop in a Harlem apartment and
cold-calling brokers.
</P>
<P>
   He is more comfortable financially now, but he still keeps a
modest profile. He shares a three-bedroom house in Teaneck, N.J.,
with his girlfriend, his 13-year-old daughter and the couple's
1-year-old son, and he drives an Acura Legend.
</P>
<P>
   Payne's hiring practices are as unconventional as his own
biography. One salesman for Wall Street Strategies was a bartender
Payne chatted up on his way home one day; another was a Manhattan
cabdriver who was lucky enough to pick up Payne as a fare one
night.
</P>
<P>
   Payne defends his seat-of-the-pants hiring. ``Hey, these guys
were more than happy to get a break, and they work as hard as
anyone I know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With all the attention he is receiving, Payne still pines for
broader recognition and a chance to run some serious money himself,
instead of just supplying intelligence to those who do. ``I keep
thinking someone's going to walk in here with a couple million to
manage one of these days,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While he is waiting, Payne serves up his picks and tips, and
allows himself an occasional daydream. ``You look in the paper and
see a mutual fund company just fired a portfolio manager who's down
25 percent this year,'' he said. ``I'm thinking, `What do I need to
do to get that sort of break?' ''

   WASHINGTON _ The report of independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr
hit Washington, the world and the Web with startling force, not
because of its graphic descriptions of sex in the most revered
setting in American life, not because of its breathy expressions of
youthful infatuation, not because of its portrait of an intricate
labyrinth of deceit, and not because of its uninterrupted cadence
of betrayal.

   From the country's capital to its back country, on paper and on
computer screens, the astonishing power of the 445-page document
and its 11 possible grounds of impeachment came from the sheer
volume of its detail, its allegations and its documentation.
</P>
<P>
   All that, plus the relentless repetition of the somber tocsin _
``President Clinton lied under oath...'' &UR;  &LR; _ that reaches to the
heart of the most intimate relationship of any president, the one
between the chief executive and the people who have asked him for
his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The side roads and back alleys of American history have spawned
many scores of documents, but in the archives of the nation's
memory there resides no document remotely like the report that
Starr completed this week.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two centuries the nation's political and cultural
life has been ruled by affairs of state. The Starr report is about
an affair of the heart, and the weaknesses of the flesh, and it
leaves a reader bleary-eyed with its petty tales of crude sexual
conduct, tender moments of comfort (``a lot of hugging,'' in the
words of Monica S. Lewinsky), unrequited amour _ and, to cite the
word with the most force, lies to conceal it all.
</P>
<P>
   That is at once the remarkable power and the stunning weakness
of the report that captivated the nation even before its contents
were available, in a landmark melding of democracy and cyberspace,
by midafternoon Friday at every computer port in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The events described in the report are breathtaking in their
smallness, in their humanness, in their portrayal of the sort of
sexual allure, awkward gestures, and alternating sentiments of
affection and anger that have been the common denominator of common
folks and kings since before Biblical times. The report
encapsulates part of the human experience and the human condition,
shaking the president from the lofty heights of national power and
placing him, with Lewinsky, in situations that are the familiar
fodder of drugstore novels.
</P>
<P>
   But because he was the president and she was an intern; because
he was married and she was not; because he was an employer and she
was an employee; because he was in his 50s and she was in her 20s;
and because he was in a position of national leadership and she was
a student visitor in a place of national awe, the relationship
between the two of them is now a threat to domestic tranquility.
</P>
<P>
   And, as the president said in prayer-breakfast remarks meant to
express his contrition and to battle back against the waves of
accusations, it is a ``sin,'' in the Good Book of his Baptist
upbringing and, surely, in any accounting of decent political
behavior and common sense.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the huge weight of the testimony and evidence that
establishes, in language that would embarrass the garden-variety
civics teacher in the middle school down the street, the sexual
relationship between the president and Lewinsky also establishes
the weakness of the report. It makes the report and its authors
vulnerable to charges that they have based their assault against
the highest elected officer in the land on behavior that, for all
its bizarre twists and unseemly brazenness, was still private,
still arguably consensual.
</P>
<P>
   The pages of the Starr report are full of the sorts of telling
detail that make its conclusions difficult to rebut _ and that
already have inflamed the sensibilities of a branch of government,
the Congress, that over the decades has seldom been known as an
outpost of respectability, rectitude and resistance to the
commonest urges.
</P>
<P>
   In this sorry story there are details that are arresting in
their banality.
</P>
<P>
   There are gifts hidden under a bed (the treasure in Betty
Currie's bedroom). There are possibly apocryphal claims of sexual
enhancement (the heretofore unappreciated role of breath mints).
There are furtive meetings (followed by desperate flights to the
bathroom to evade intruders). And there is an arrangement where,
according to the report, ``on a few occasions during her White
House employment, Ms. Lewinsky and the President arranged to bump
into each other in the hallway; he then would invite her to
accompany him to the Oval Office.''
</P>
<P>
   In these pages Clinton appears more cad than cavalier; more
vulnerable than vindictive; more prurient than presidential. As a
result, a president who has agonized over his place in history took
breathtaking risks, not the least of which is the danger that he
might join William Howard Taft in the nation's collective
recollection of presidential indignity _ not, like Taft, as the
president who was so fat that he got stuck in a White House
bathtub, but as the president who was so physically needy and
greedy that he was serviced sexually in the White House while on
the telephone with a member of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But the goal of the report was not to chronicle a tawdry
relationship, but to establish ``substantial and credible
information that President Clinton criminally obstructed the
judicial process, first in a sexual harassment lawsuit in which he
was the defendant and then in a grand jury investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   In that effort the Starr investigation raises substantial and
credible questions about some of the central issues of the enduring
American debate, issues that go far beyond the president's sexual
behavior and his determination to hide an improper affair from his
wife, hundreds of scoop-hungry reporters and 280 million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Americans, including the president, are entitled to enjoy
a private family life, free from public or governmental scrutiny,''
the Starr team writes in its introduction. ``But the private
concerns raised in this case are subject to limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Those limits, the independent counsel's office argues, were
reached when the president lied or concealed evidence in the Paula
Corbin Jones sexual harassment case; when he attempted, according
to the investigators, ``to obstruct the gathering of evidence,''
and when he breached ``the enormous trust and responsibility
attendant to his high office.''
</P>
<P>
   The breach of trust that the investigators sketch isn't only
against the high ideals and mythic power of the presidency. It is
against his friends, including Vernon E. Jordan Jr., the prominent
capital lawyer, and against his aides, whom he is said to have
deliberately misled in an effort to shape and distort their
remarks, both to the American people and to a federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The report also portrays the president as the master of the
rhetorical dodge, a pathfinder in lawyerly evasion. He denied in
his Jones deposition that he and Lewinsky had had a ``sexual
relationship,'' arguing that any relationship that does not include
intercourse is not sexual, and stating that ``most ordinary
Americans'' would embrace this distinction. He raises the
legalistic possibility that in being the recipient of oral sex,
Lewinsky engaged in sexual relations but he did not.
</P>
<P>
   The future of this episode and of the impeachment process that
may follow will hang on whether the Congress and the public agree
that the connection between the sexual activities and the effort to
hide and then to deny them are grave enough to warrant an
undertaking that would revoke the results of the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   The Starr report includes the sinews of that connection, plus
the allegations of lies in a civil case and in a grand-jury
deposition, the accusation that he obstructed justice and
``improperly tampered'' with a potential witness, ``all as part of
an effort to hinder, impede, and deflect possibly inquiry by the
Congress of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The activities that spawned the deceptions may be common, base,
or private. But the implications are uncommon, weighty and public.
In the balance are the Clinton presidency, the institution of the
presidency and the course and content of American politics for the
next 26 months.

WELD'S SUCCESSOR IN MASSACHUSETTS BATTLES FOR OWN TERM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Funny. Bill Weld made it look so easy.
</P>
<P>
   But as his successor in the governor's corner office on Beacon
Hill is finding out, running as a Republican in Democrat-packed
Massachusetts is no serene stroll through the fall foliage.
</P>
<P>
   Argeo Paul Cellucci, the longtime lieutenant governor who took
over when the restless Weld cut short his second term to seek the
ambassadorship to Mexico last year, is widely seen as one of the
more vulnerable of the incumbents in the 36 races for governor this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan political analysis,
this summer put Massachusetts among just four states _ the others
being Alabama, New Mexico and Rhode Island _ where Republican
governors face races considered tossups.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say Cellucci's tough slogging is not all his
fault. Among Massachusetts voters, 48 percent are registered as
independents, 39 percent as Democrats and just 13 percent as
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``So right away, the Republicans are at a big disadvantage, and
have to get those independents who can go either way,'' said Gerry
Chervinsky, president of KRC Communications Research and the
pollster for WBZ-TV and The Boston Globe. ``So Cellucci has to be
vulnerable; he's an incumbent Republican in a heavily Democratic
state.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is just one of the reasons Cellucci (pronounced
se-LOO-chee) is struggling.
</P>
<P>
   First, what should have been a light warmup fight, his contest
for the Republican nomination in the primary on Tuesday against
State Treasurer Joseph Malone, has turned into a punishing and
decidedly nasty bout. Malone has been attacking Cellucci on
everything from his personal debt, reported to be about $700,000,
to his ethics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a credit-card mentality,'' Malone has said.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci says that his assets exceed his liabilities, and that
the debt arose in the course of rearing children.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, as the fight has intensified to the point that
state Republican leaders rebuked Malone for engaging in ``gutter
politics,'' the news media have focused on who leaked _ and
possibly illegally obtained _ a report on Cellucci's personal
finances. Though its source remains undisclosed, political Poirots
figure that the Malone campaign's fingerprints are all over it.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's campaign has been fighting back by accusing Malone of
dirty tricks and attack-dog tactics _ as well as asserting that
Malone has ethical violations of his own _ while depicting the
acting governor as a positive force in the state who has helped cut
taxes by $1 billion and sought to improve education.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, pollsters say, Malone's political assaults thus far may
not have taken much of a toll on Cellucci, and appear instead to
have boomeranged on Malone. A Boston Herald poll published on
Wednesday found that 54 percent of likely Republican voters
supported Cellucci compared with 25 percent for Malone; two weeks
earlier, Cellucci had the support of 50 percent and Malone 32
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say those are not the numbers Cellucci needs to
worry about: The real challenge will come from his Democratic
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The front-runner for that role is Scott Harshbarger, the state
attorney general who started his campaign so many months ago _ long
before the official announcement in April _ that he seems to have
been running for years.
</P>
<P>
   Back last year when Rep. Joseph Kennedy II still intended to run
for governor, Harshbarger's candidacy looked pale in comparison.
But in the wake of the skiing death of Michael Kennedy, his
brother, Kennedy announced that he was dropping out of politics for
now. And lately, though Harshbarger won only a narrow endorsement
from his party at the convention in June, polls show the campaign
picking up steam.
</P>
<P>
   In debates with his two Democratic rivals, former State Sen.
Patricia McGovern and former U.S. Rep. Brian Donnelly, Harshbarger
has clearly been concerned more with attacking Cellucci's record
than with his Democratic colleagues _ to the point that Ms.
McGovern has begged him to keep Cellucci's name out of their
debates.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger's platform has emphasized his record as attorney
general in fighting the tobacco companies and enforcing
environmental laws; he has also promised increased financing and
deeper reform for education.
</P>
<P>
   His poll numbers are looking rosy. A Boston Globe-WBZ-TV poll
published on Sept. 1 found that 74 percent of Democrats viewed
Harshbarger favorably, compared with the 63 percent of the much
less numerous Republican voters who said they viewed Cellucci
favorably.
</P>
<P>
   The strong economic times would seem to favor an incumbent, and
despite the state's Democratic leanings, Massachusetts voters have
repeatedly forsaken their partisan tastes for Republican governors
in the past.
</P>
<P>
   But in a way, analysts say, Cellucci may suffer from an awkward
situation in which his incumbency has been so brief that it leaves
him open to attacks on his record while not allowing him to reap
its fruits.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me,'' said Tubby Harrison, a Democratic pollster who has
done some work for Ms. McGovern in this race, ``it's a question of
that he hasn't yet proved he's a governor _ he just inherited the
Weld mantle.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Harshbarger has never been governor. In addition,
analysts say he will need to overcome a tricky legacy of his own:
voters' association of Democratic candidates with the former
liberal Democratic Gov. Michael Dukakis, who presided over the
state in its last economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``They like Harshbarger a little better,'' Chervinsky said,
``but he still has to convince people he's not another Dukakis.''

FIREMEN WHO WORE BLACKFACE IN PARADE ARE SUSPENDED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ City officials suspended two firefighters without pay
on Friday, saying the two men had admitted wearing blackface while
riding a float at a Labor Day parade in Queens. At least one police
officer is also facing possible suspension, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said the indefinite suspensions were the
first step in what he hoped would be an eventual dismissal of the
city workers involved in designing the float, which also at one
point mocked the dragging death of a black man in Texas. The mayor
said the city workers who took part had ``demonstrated a total lack
of understanding'' of their oath of office.
</P>
<P>
   But with the mayor acting swiftly to discipline the employees,
lawyers advising the workers questioned whether the city had the
right to dismiss them over what the lawyers portrayed as a
free-speech issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the mayor has to recognize and what the city has to
recognize is that the First Amendment protects the obnoxious,
repugnant, outrageous and controversial _ including racist
statements,'' said Norman Siegel, executive director of the New
York Civil Liberties Union, who added that he was discussing the
case Friday night with city officials.
</P>
<P>
   The suspended firefighters, Jonathan Walters and Robert Steiner,
both 29, walked into Fire Department headquarters in Brooklyn on
Friday morning and admitted participating in the float, said Fire
Commissioner Thomas Von Essen. He added that both Walters, an
eight-year veteran of the department, and Steiner, who has worked
there for two years, ``were very apologetic'' and expressed remorse
for their involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Walters was a senior firefighter at Engine Company 231 in
Brooklyn, while Steiner was a firefighter at Ladder Company 17 in
the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Howard Safir said one of his officers, whom he
would not name, had also been identified as a possible participant
and would be suspended by the end of the day if the accusations
were true. City officials said two other police officers may also
be implicated in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred on Monday during Broad Channel's annual
Labor Day parade, which is sponsored by the Broad Channel Volunteer
Fire Department and Ambulance Corps. According to witnesses and
city officials, a float holding the firefighters and up to three
off-duty police officers featured men in blackface and Afro wigs,
who at times threw watermelon slices from the flatbed of their
truck and danced with boom-boxes held next to their ears.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, one of the participants re-enacted the June
killing of James Byrd, a black man who was dragged to his death
behind a pickup truck in southeast Texas. Three white men have been
indicted on capital murder charges in that case.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said the Queens district attorney has so far declined
to prosecute the men, saying there appeared to be no basis for
criminal charges. But he added that there was plenty of evidence to
discipline them at the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   The firefighters union, the Uniformed Firefighters Association,
said in a statement Friday evening that it was ``obligated to
represent our members and to protect their rights under the
collective bargaining agreement and the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lou Matarazzo, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent
Association, which represents police officers, said his union's
lawyers would not defend any officers who participated in ``this
disgraceful racist incident.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Regan, a spokesman for the Fire Department, said the two
firefighters faced administrative charges of engaging in conduct
that discredited their uniform by violating several regulations,
including one that bans any activity ``that may be instrumental in
arousing religious, racial or other hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   Police Department officials said any police officer found to be
involved in the float could face similar administrative charges.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Siegel and Marvyn Kornberg, a lawyer representing Steiner, said
the city would have a difficult time firing the men.
</P>
<P>
   ``What these men did was a stupid prank that had nothing to do
with the Fire Department, and they apologized for what they have
done,'' Kornberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that last year the mayor posed in drag before a crowd at
a press event, an act he called ``equally offensive to a number of
people,'' he said, ``I don't see the mayor quitting.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials said that everyone on the float was from the
Broad Channel or Rockaway area, and that Walters and Steiner had
been friends since grade school. But there was little in either
firefighter's past to indicate any racist leanings, fire officials
added, noting that the officers had performed well on duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is anything in there to make any
connection to any event like this; I know that for a fact,'' Von
Essen said.
</P>
<P>
   Steiner's fellow firefighters in the Mott Haven section of the
Bronx said Friday afternoon that they were shocked that he had
become embroiled in the dispute, describing him as a ``straight
shooter'' who volunteered often for community events and was ``not
afraid to get his hands dirty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not typical of anything he's done before,'' said
Steiner's commander, Capt. George Gabriel.

JUDGE TELLS TWO IN LOUIMA CASE OF LAWYERS' POSSIBLE CONFLICTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge on Friday warned two police officers
accused of brutalizing Abner Louima at a Brooklyn station house in
1997 that there was a risk they might not get the best possible
defense if they kept their lawyers because of ``actual or potential
conflicts of interest'' that the lawyers have in the case.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge, Eugene Nickerson of U.S. District Court in
Brooklyn, said he would permit the officers to keep the lawyers if
the officers convinced him at a hearing next week that they fully
understood the risk and were willing to accept it.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the lawyers, when retained to represent the
officers in August 1997 _ shortly after Louima says he was
assaulted and tortured by a group of officers who arrested him in a
Brooklyn street brawl _ were with separate law firms but have since
become partners in a new firm.
</P>
<P>
   Further adding to the actual or potential conflicts, the judge
said, was that the new firm obtained a $10 million, two-year
contract with the city police officers' union under which the firm,
since May 1, has been representing all of the union's members in
court cases stemming from their actions while on duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't take this lightly _ this is a serious matter,''
Nickerson told the two officers, Charles Schwarz and Thomas Bruder,
as they stood before him while he explained to each of them that
``the fact that your attorney has a law partner representing
another defendant'' in the same case ``may cause him to hesitate to
exercise his independent judgment on your behalf.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge was echoing the view of the prosecutors in the case,
from the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn, who first raised the
conflict issue in May, saying that the risks posed by a single law
firm representing co-defendants in a criminal case included ``the
possibility that one partner will forgo viable defense strategies
beneficial to his client but which may conflict with the strategy
of his partner.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors are wary of any situation that might let
officers in the case _ in which four officers are charged with
violating Louima's civil rights _ appeal a conviction using the
argument that their lawyers' conflicts kept them from receiving the
most effective defense.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nickerson directly discussed that possibility Friday, telling
Schwarz and Bruder that if they chose to keep their lawyers _
Stephen Worth for Schwarz and Stuart London for Bruder _ ``you
should understand you have no ground to complain about it if
there's a conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   Worth and London have repeatedly held that there are no
conflicts that require their removal from the case, whether the
issue involves their representation of two officers charged in the
federal criminal case or their representation of police officers
generally through their contract with the union, the Patrolmen's
Benevolent Association.
</P>
<P>
   Bruder and Schwarz are among five members of the force being
prosecuted in the case, with the three others _ officers Justin
Volpe and Thomas Wiese and Sgt. Michael Bellomo _ represented by
lawyers who are not partners with London and Worth or with one
another.
</P>
<P>
   All except Bellomo are charged with violating Louima's rights.
Prosecutors say that the four officers beat Louima in a police car
on the way to the station house after he was arrested in the brawl.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe is also accused of later ramming a stick into Louima's
rectum and then his mouth in a station house bathroom, causing
major internal injuries, while Schwarz allegedly held Louima down.
</P>
<P>
   Bellomo is charged with trying to cover up the beating. The five
officers say the charges are untrue.

<SLUG> BC-CLINTON-SCANDAL-2ND </SLUG>
   TAKE-BOS  
 WASHINGTON: ... about it.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Clinton testified about the encounter during his January
deposition in the Jones case, he couldn't recall if he was alone
with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Lewinsky was still an intern but was working the chief of
staff's office because all the employees had to go home ... she was
back there with a pizza that she brought to me and to others,''
Clinton testified. ``I do not believe she was there alone, however.
I don't think she was.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to Starr's report, Clinton could hardly have
forgotten this particular _ and quite private _ encounter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Lewinsky testified that she and the President had a sexual
encounter during this visit,'' the Starr report said. ``They
kissed, and the President touched Ms. Lewinsky's bare breasts with
his hands and mouth.'' The report goes on to say how Lewinsky
performed oral sex on the president while he talked on the
telephone with a member of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Of the alleged sexual encounters between Clinton and Lewinsky,
this one could cause Clinton the most problems because he talked
specifically about it during the Jones deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, there have been questions about whether Clinton lied
when he said he did not have a sexual relationship or affair with
Lewinsky. Clinton said in his Aug. 17 address to the nation that he
was ``legally accurate'' when he denied having sexual relations
with Lewinsky. Clinton's lawyers explained that the president was
relying on the definition of sexual relations used in the Jones
case, which the president's advisers said did not include oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr's report said Clinton's contact with Lewinsky did fall
within the definition used in the Jones case, which is: ``contact
with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks
of any person with an intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire
of any person.''
</P>
<P>
   During his grand jury testimony, the Starr report said, Clinton
refused to say whether Lewinsky performed oral sex on him. But the
president went on to say that oral sex did not fall within the
definition of sexual relations used in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, Clinton testified on Aug. 17 that if
``the person who has oral sex performed on him, then the contact is
with _ not with anything on that list, but with the lips of another
person. It seems to be self-evident that that's what it is. . .
.Let me remind you, sir, I read this carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's report, however, said, ``The President's linguistic
parsing is unreasonable. Under the President's interpretation
(which he says he followed at his deposition), in an oral sex
encounter, one person is engaged in sexual relations, but the other
person is not engaged in sexual relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton agreed that touching someone's breasts would have fallen
within the definition of sexual relations, the Starr report said,
but the president disputed Lewinsky's testimony that he touched her
breasts.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's report also provides evidence on these key points:
</P>
<P>
   -- The dress. After months of conflicting reports about whether
Clinton's semen was on one of Lewinsky's dresses, a blue dress from
the Gap turned out to be one of Starr's most crucial pieces of
evidence. The report said that after Lewinsky had an encounter with
Clinton on Feb. 28, 1997, ``she noticed stains on the garment the
next time she took it from her closet. From their location, she
surmised that the stains were the President's semen.''
</P>
<P>
   After prosecutors took a blood sample from Clinton on Aug. 3 in
the White House map room, the FBI performed tests and determined
that the stain matched the DNA. The test was so exact that the FBI
found that the DNA match is ``characteristic of one out of 7.87
trillion Caucasians,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   -- Gifts. Clinton gave Lewinsky about 18 gifts, including a copy
of Walt Whitman's ``Leaves Of Grass,'' while Lewinsky gave him 30
to 38 gifts, including six ties. The report said he turned over
only one gift to the National Archives, a matted poem given by
Lewinsky and other interns to commemorate ``National Bosses Day''
that Clinton received before the relationship with Lewinsky had
begun.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's gifts to Clinton included a book entitled ``Our
Patriotic President: His Life in Pictures, Anecdotes, Sayings,
Principles and Biography.'' She also gave him a book on Peter the
Great, a volume called Oy Vey, and Vox, which the report describes
as ``a novel about phone sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's report said Clinton obstructed justice through an
``understanding'' with Lewinsky that the former intern would return
gifts subpoenaed by lawyers in the Jones case. Clinton testified in
the Jones case that he couldn't recall giving Lewinsky any gifts,
even when he was asked specifically about the Whitman book and
other items.
</P>
<P>
   The report, however, leaves unclear whether Clinton played a
role in having Lewinsky's gifts turned over to Currie. The report
said Lewinsky ``asked the President if she should put the gifts
away somewhere. The President responded `I don't know' or `Hmm' or
`Let me think about it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, Currie called Lewinsky and said she would come
by to pick up the gifts from Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   -- Clinton's job help. Starr's report alleges that Clinton
``endeavored to obstruct justice'' by helping Lewinsky get a job in
New York. The report also vividly describes how Lewinsky frequently
complained to the president that Clinton's aides were preventing
her from returning to the White House. At one point, Lewinsky's
complaints prompted Clinton to tell the former intern that it is
``illegal to threaten the president of the United States,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 11, 1997, Clinton talked to his chief of staff, Erskine
Bowles, about getting a job recommendation for Lewinsky. But
Lewinsky, in a conversation recorded by Tripp, said she wanted
Clinton's friend, Vernon E. Jordan Jr., to help with the job
search.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Lewinsky told Tripp, ``Somebody could construe or
say, `Well, they gave her a job to shut her up.' ''
</P>
<P>
   -- Talking points. In what may be the best news for Clinton in
the report, Starr does not make any allegation that Clinton or his
aides were involved in the writing of the ``talking points.'' That
document, which Lewinsky gave to Tripp, instructed Tripp to say
that she had no knowledge of the president having an inappropriate
encounter with White House volunteer Kathleen Willey. Lewinsky
testified that she wrote the talking points herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no `talking points' smoking gun,'' Clinton's lawyers
wrote in a rebuttal to the Starr report. The rebuttal noted that
Starr spokesman Charles Bakaly said earlier this year that
questions about the talking points were a key reason Starr was
granted authority to look into whether Clinton urged others to
commit perjury or obstruct justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the key mandate to look into those kinds of issues of
subornation of perjury and obstruction of justice,'' Bakaly said.

STARR REPORT REPLETE WITH SEX, ACCUSATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH AND BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr, compiling a
potentially devastating chronicle of President Clinton's adulterous
affair and his months of subsequent lies, has proposed 11 possible
grounds for impeachment to the Congress, propelling the nation
toward a constitutional battle not seen since the fall of Richard
Nixon in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   In the 445-page report released by the House of Representatives
Friday, Starr accuses Clinton of repeatedly committing perjury in
concealing his relationship with former White House intern Monica
S. Lewinsky, obstructing justice, tampering with a potential
witness, and abusing the power of his office.
</P>
<P>
   The report, written in a chronological narrative that would
rival any Washington-based novel and supported by a weightier legal
argument, includes a series of lurid descriptions of Clinton's
affair with Lewinsky, including 10 sessions of oral sex near the
Oval Office, among them one episode on Easter Sunday 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The report charges that Clinton coached his personal secretary's
potential testimony in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit
and said Clinton worked with Lewinsky in concealing their affair
from Jones' lawyers. It also says Clinton continued to lie about
the nature and extent of his sexual relationship with Lewinsky in
his Aug. 17 testimony before a federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is substantial and credible information that the
president's actions with respect to Monica Lewinsky constitute an
abuse of authority inconsistent with the president's constitutional
duty to faithfully execute the laws,'' the report states.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's personal and White House lawyers immediately fired
back Friday, acknowledging the affair but arguing that Clinton's
personal indiscretions and his natural attempts to conceal them do
not constitute an impeachable offense. Starr, they said, loaded his
report with personal innuendo designed to damage Clinton
politically as well as legally.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a new story: A man tried to keep an inappropriate
relationship private,'' said David E. Kendall, Clinton's lead
attorney on the case, in a briefing with reporters in the West
Wing. ``The salacious allegations in this referral are simply
intended to humiliate, embarrass and politically damage the
president. In short, this is personal and not impeachable.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall pointedly denied that Clinton coached witnesses or
obstructed justice, and steadfastly maintained that Clinton
testified truthfully in the Jones deposition in January when he
denied having sexual relations with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has acknowledged his personal wrongdoing,'' said
Kendall. ``He did not obstruct justice. He did not tamper with
witnesses, he did not abuse the power of his office.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself, his eyes glistening and his voice thick with
emotion, mentioned Lewinsky in public Friday morning for the first
time since his January denial. Speaking to a group of ministers
gathered at the White House for an annual prayer breakfast, Clinton
delivered his most dramatic plea for the crisis to end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to me that everybody who has been hurt know
that the sorrow I feel is genuine,'' he said, with Hillary Rodham
Clinton sitting expressionless nearby. ``First and most important,
my family; also my friends; my staff; my Cabinet; Monica Lewinsky
and her family, and the American people. I have asked all for their
forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   His pleas and the arguments of his lawyers may have fallen on
deaf ears on Capitol Hill, where some crucial lawmakers expressed
initial shock at the allegations contained in the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to tell you, what I've read so far is not good,'' said
Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, a barometer of Republican sentiment on
Clinton's plight. ``As you read this, some will try to make this a
purely sexual matter, a purely private matter, but I don't see
anything so far that has Judge Starr saying he should be impeached
because of a purely sexual relationship. That's a very important
distinction.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a day when an ocean of speculation finally parted to
reveal the steely allegations contained in Starr's long-awaited
report. Once revealed, the depth and breadth of the allegations in
the report proved stunning.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the cornerstone findings had been disseminated to
the public for months, key points became clear, including the role
of Clinton's secretary, Betty Currie, in ushering Lewinsky in and
out of the Oval Office for the sexual trysts and in attempting to
conceal the many gifts that Clinton had given to Lewinsky
throughout their 16-month affair.
</P>
<P>
   Currie appeared to tell the grand jury that she used to come to
work on weekends for the sole purpose of admitting Lewinsky into
the White House for her sessions with Clinton. On one occasion,
according to the report, Currie waited in an outer room while
Lewinsky performed oral sex on Clinton inside his private study.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 28, 1997, as Lewinsky's role as a witness in the Jones
case became clear, Currie drove to Lewinsky's Watergate apartment
and retrieved a box of gifts that Clinton had given to the young
woman. Currie took them home, according to the report, and hid them
under her bed.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation that was launched by a series of secret
tape-recordings by former Lewinsky colleague Linda R. Tripp ended
up not relying on those recordings at all. The report suggests that
a few of the tapes may have been doctored in some way, and the
parade of 75 witnesses who came before the grand jury provided
details as graphic and damning as anything that may have been on
the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI analysis raised ``questions about the reliability and
authenticity of at least one recording, which in turn raise
questions about the accuracy of Ms. Tripp's testimony regarding her
handling of the tapes,'' the report said. While Starr's report does
include quotations from the Tripp tapes, it does not quote from any
tapes that showed signs of duplication or tampering.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Clinton's most significant legal problems could stem
from, of all things, a pizza delivery.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 17, 1995, Currie told the president that Lewinsky had
arrived with his dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sir,'' Currie said, ``the girl's here with the pizza.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``girl'' with Clinton's pizza was Lewinsky, and the
following scene of oral sex adjacent to the Oval Office sounds like
it comes from a B-grade movie. In fact, the details described in
Starr's report go to the heart of the prosecutor's case that the
president had a sexual relationship with the former intern and
committed perjury when asked about it.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Save your Aussie money _ the South Pacific island
will rise again.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Australian dollar is that lovable: 48 cents against
its US counterpart at one point last week. But those olden golden
days when Aussies made American guys feel like nickel-and-dimers at
the game of tennis may have returned at the US Open. Ambling into
view this afternoon as a couple of characters in a sporting remake
of ``The Way We Were'' are Patrick Rafter and Mark Philippoussis,
who seem to have been fast-forwarded from someplace between 1951
and 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward is definitely their ethic. Rafter and
Philippoussis, rushing headlong to establish beachheads at the net,
are emulating the bygone heroes of their bedtime stories about an
era when Australia turned out tennis players like Kenneth Starr
piling up accusations _ most of them just as damaging.
</P>
<P>
   Their raining terror on the US Championships started with Frank
Sedgman winning the titles of 1951-52 and continued through Kenny
Rosewall, Mal Anderson, Ashley Cooper, Neale Fraser, Roy Emerson,
Rod Laver, Fred Stolle, and John Newcombe _ 15 titles in 23 years,
a torrent of seven straight as Laver completed his first Grand Slam
in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the way of today at Flushing Meadow. But Rafter,
risking his crown opposite the acquisitive four-time king _ Pete
Sampras _ and Philippoussis, up against Carlos Moya, are the Charge
of the Light Brigade in short trousers, oblivious to the perils of
the passing-shot cannoneers. Not since 1974 (Newcombe and Rosewall)
has an antipodean pair been in the semis.
</P>
<P>
   Serve-and-volley, chip-and-charge _ attack, attack, attack ...
and keep the change. That's the mode of these two big spenders of
spectacular, high-energy points. However, that's where the
similarity, besides passports, ends.
</P>
<P>
   If you are an Australian hostess, you don't invite both Patrick
and Mark to your party. No palace is roomy enough for both of them
because at home, Rafter is the Good Aussie and Philippoussis the
Bad Aussie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very young; I'm still learning,'' says 21-year-old
Philippoussis. A good kid with bad judgement, he committed a huge
public relations double fault in January, alienating virtually
every inhabitant of his continent, aside from a few indifferent
wombats and emus. By declining to play Davis Cup for the homeland,
he committed a grievous sin. Fault 1.
</P>
<P>
   This is Benedict Arnold-style behavior Down Under, where the Cup
is a holier grail than even a beer keg. Sampras ducks duty in the
US but he wouldn't get away with it unscathed in an underpopulated
land where pride in conquering the world on a tennis court is
fierce.
</P>
<P>
   Then Fault 2: Philippoussis, who'd said he needed time off,
curiously showed up, anyway, as a telecaster at the Aussies'
initial encounter, an unthinkable upset by Zimbabwe in Australia,
lost largely because Rafter was ill. Had Philippoussis played, no
problem. But Mark, babbling in the booth rather than routinely
bombing 125-mile-per-hour serves on the nearby court, became a
marked man.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight he was ``Sillypoussis'' in the papers, tagged with
numerous adjectives, of which ``unpatriotic'' was probably the
kindest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Livid'' was probably the gentlest describing the reaction of
team captain and national icon Newcombe, the last Aussie (1973)
until Rafter last year to rule the US. Philippoussis had hoped to
play later in the season, the relegation contest against Uzbekistan
(likely unlosable even if Newk himself, 54, has to play). His
response: ``This is a team proposition, and you're either on or off
at the start. Check in next year.''
</P>
<P>
   The gargantuan Philippoussis, 6 feet 4 inches and serving
meteorically, hasn't helped his reputation by ``going flash,'' as
it's said. Tootling about modestly in a yellow Lamborghini and
exhibiting other trappings of wealth, the world No. 22 couldn't
help but look bad alongside the sweating striver, No. 3 Rafter, one
of nine children. A ``dinkum (regular guy) Aussie,'' with a dread
of expanded head syndrome, Patrick says, ``I just want to remain
the same bag of (expletive) I've always been.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A recent poll,'' says Geoff Pollard, president of Tennis
Australia, ``has shown Pat to be the best-known and most popular
person in our country, not just among sportsmen. What an asset he
is to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   In this Good/Bad morality play, Rafter, after complaining he was
``tired of the game,'' ironically lifted off early last year as a
last-minute Davis Cup replacement for an injured Philippoussis.
Cup-holding France was the foe, and Cedric Pioline jumped Rafter to
take a two-set lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed that win, needed Pat to start competing,'' recalls
Newcombe. ``I looked him in the eye and said, `Pat, this is a war
of attrition!' Damned if he didn't play as never before, won it in
five, and we were on our way _ us to the semis, he to the US title.
I felt pretty pleased that what I said had sunk in.
</P>
<P>
   ``But later,'' he laughs, ``Pat said to me, `Newk, what does
attrition mean?'''
</P>
<P>
   It's attrition time again. Newk likes the way Rafter escaped
from opening-round ignominy in the lefthanded form of the gifted
tiny Moroccan, Hicham Arazi. After getting stomped by Arazi for the
first two sets, Rafter ruthlessly won 15 of the next 16 in his five
victories.
</P>
<P>
   But Philippoussis ``also showed me some heart in the quarters,''
says Newcombe, ``the way he threw himself all over the place to
beat that tough little Swede (Tom Johansson) from three match
points down in the fifth-set tie-breaker.''
</P>
<P>
   For Australians stranded on the isle they call Oz _ from Sydney
to Perth, Port Darwin to Adelaide _ their all-night telly vigil,
commencing at 2 a.m., will be merely euphoric if their Good and Bad
boys both come through. An intramural final would return them to a
time when such were almost customary. Over one particularly
devastating stretch of the tourists' beastly treatment of their
hosts, there were 10 exclusives between 1956 and the most recent,
1970, Rosewall over Tony Roche. Even though well loved in the US,
the Aussies did tend to overdo.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's Philippoussis's shot at painting himself Good, Rafter's
at attaining a shade of Gooder. Should the Bad Aussie go all the
way _ ``He could; I remember too well how he totally overpowered me
two years ago at the Australian,'' says Sampras _ the folks at home
will gratefully line up to wash and wax his yellow Lamborghini.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Whitewater independent counsel's case for
possible impeachment of President Clinton was made public Friday,
including an avalanche of salacious details of the president's
affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In arguing to the House of Representatives that the president
violated his oath of office with repeated acts of perjury and
obstruction of justice, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr described
in intimate detail Ms. Lewinsky's account of her many meetings with
the president, including 10 sexual encounters.
</P>
<P>
   The House must now judge whether Starr has presented a
compelling case for the impeachment of the president. There is so
much material in the report about his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky, and so much contradictory testimony from the president
and his defenders, that it will take weeks to gauge the power of
Starr's case.
</P>
<P>
   The White House angrily responded that the Starr report was a
lurid and politically motivated attempt ``intended to humiliate the
president and force him from office.'' Clinton's lawyers said that
Starr and his team of prosecutors had, after four years of intense
investigative labor, found ``personal, not impeachable'' misconduct
by the president.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Starr's relentlessly accusatory 445-page report
riveted Washington and permanently changed the terms of the debate
over Clinton's fitness for office. On Friday, some members of
Congress reacted with outrage, and some with revulsion, at the
report's torrent of embarrassing details about Clinton's sexual
relationship with a woman less than half his age just outside the
Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   The House, which authorized the release of the report on an
overwhelming bipartisan vote Friday afternoon, will soon begin
deliberations that could lead to the second presidential
impeachment hearings of the century.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 counts of possible impeachable offenses against Clinton _
all of which arose from his liaison with Ms. Lewinsky and not from
Whitewater and other matters Starr has investigated _ echo two of
the articles of impeachment voted against President Nixon in 1974.
Nixon was found by the House Judiciary Committee to have obstructed
justice and abused the power of his office in trying to cover up
the Watergate break-in and related offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The report contains allegations of crimes for which Clinton
could face criminal prosecution if he leaves office through
resignation or impeachment. Some prosecutors in Starr's office want
to keep the federal grand jury here in operation for another year
in order to indict him.
</P>
<P>
   The document describes in graphic detail several of Clinton's
sexual encounters with Ms. Lewinsky in areas around the Oval Office
and provides a detailed narrative of Clinton's prolonged efforts to
impede the independent counsel's inquiry and to persuade others to
assist in a conspiracy to ``hinder, impede and deflect''
investigations by a federal grand jury and the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The report provides a seamy account of an illicit relationship
between the president of the United States and an unpaid
21-year-old intern and the lengths to which he went to conceal it
from his family, his staff and the public.
</P>
<P>
   It offered a wealth of new details, from the origin of Clinton's
decision to try to thwart Starr's inquiry, in a discussion with
political adviser Dick Morris, to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation's determination that that a semen stain on a blue
dress belonging to Ms. Lewinsky came from the president. The odds
of the semen having come from someone other than Clinton, the FBI
reported, are 1 in nearly 8 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   The report reveals that Clinton decided upon a strategy of
stonewalling the Starr investigation the same day his relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky was made public, Jan. 21. That evening, Clinton
consulted Morris, who told him that an instant poll had shown that
the American people would be willing to forgive adultery, but not
perjury or obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Morris told the president that confession of the full details of
the affair was therefore not an option. According to Morris' grand
jury testimony, the president replied, ``Well, we just have to win,
then.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a tearful confessional at a White House prayer
breakfast Friday, acknowledged that he had ``sinned'' in his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and apologized for the first time to
her and her family. But the president vowed a vigorous defense
against Starr's charges.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, in the first volley of its counterattack
against Starr and his report, issued a combative 78-page rebuttal
Friday afternoon even before officials had read the report.
</P>
<P>
   The response, written by David Kendall, the president's private
attorney, and White House Counsel Charles Ruff, said that the
independent counsel was trying to drive the president from office
for a sexual indiscretion for which he has already apologized. The
lawyers denied that Clinton had committed any of the other crimes
alleged by the prosecutor and asserted that none of the president's
actions constituted impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers said Starr had ``dangerously overreached
to describe in the most dramatic of terms conduct that not only is
not criminal but is actually proper and lawful.''
</P>
<P>
   Their response admitted that Clinton had given incomplete and
misleading answers in a deposition in the Paula Jones lawsuit in
January and again before a federal grand jury in August. But they
denied that they constituted perjury.

</P>
<P>
   The Starr report's strongest sections describe exhaustively the
sexual activity between Ms. Lewinsky and Clinton and Clinton's
repeated misrepresentations about it under oath. The document's
authors said Clinton's evasiveness before the federal grand jury
forced them to include the salacious details about the sexual
encounters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first two possible grounds for impeachment concern the
president's lying under oath about the nature of his relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky,'' the report stated. ``The details associated
with those grounds are, by their nature, explicit. The president's
testimony unfortunately has rendered the details essential with
respect to those two grounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors gave great weight to Ms. Lewinsky's accounts of her
sexual activities with the president. While the president has
admitted engaging in some forms of sexual conduct, he specifically
denied other forms. It was those statements that are the basis of
allegations of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors gave great weight to Ms. Lewinsky's accounts of her
sexual activities with the president. While the president has
admitted engaging in some forms of sexual conduct, he specifically
denied other forms. It was those statements that are the basis of
allegations of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   In their response, Clinton's lawyers said that answers to
ambiguous questions can never be perjury. And, they said, ``nobody
can be convicted of perjury based on only one other person's
testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   The report accuses the president and Ms. Lewinsky of agreeing to
concoct ``cover stories'' to keep their relationship a secret.
</P>
<P>
   During a March 29, 1997, sexual encounter with Ms. Lewinsky, the
president told Ms. Lewinsky that ``he suspected that a foreign
embassy (he did not specify which one) was tapping his telephones,
and he proposed cover stories. If ever questioned, she should say
that the two of them were just friends. If anyone ever asked about
their phone sex, she should say that they knew their calls were
being monitored all along, and the phone sex was just a put-on,''
according to Ms. Lewinsky's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The president denied her account during his grand jury
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors wrote that Ms. Lewinsky's account was
corroborated by contemporaneous discussions she had with 11 people,
including eight friends, two psychological counselors and her
mother, Marcia Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Sections alleging abuse of power and witness tampering appear
less conclusive. The single accusation of witness tampering arose
from discussions Clinton had with his personal secretary, Betty
Currie, immediately after his deposition in the Paula Jones
lawsuit. Prosecutors believe that Clinton tried to influence her
testimony with a series of leading questions, but Mrs. Currie's
testimony on several key points was ambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   The Starr report also accused the president of abusing his
office by lying repeatedly to the public and in court proceedings.
The charge also includes the president's repeated refusal to
voluntarily testify before the grand jury and his invocation of
executive privilege to block testimony by key aides. Clinton
ultimately testified after he was subpoenaed and the president's
privilege claims were denied by federal judges.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers rejected that argument, saying ``If
allowing aides to repeat misleading statements is a crime, then any
number of public officials are guilty of misusing their office for
as long as they fail to admit wrongdoing in response to any
allegation about their activity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Starr report cited 11 specific possible grounds for
impeachment in four categories: Five counts of lying under oath,
four counts of obstruction of justice, one count of witness
tampering and one count of abuse of constitutional authority.
</P>
<P>
   The report, written by several assistants in Starr's office, is
methodical and exhaustive. When confronted by conflicting accounts,
however, the report tends to accept the version most damaging to
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``After being subpoenaed in July,'' the report says in one
summary passage describing what it called a pattern of perjury by
Clinton, ``the president made false statements to the grand jury on
Aug. 17, 1998. That night, the president again made false
statements to the American people and Congress, contending that his
answers in his civil deposition had been `legally accurate.' The
president then made an implicit plea for Congress to take no
action: `Our country has been distracted by this matter for too
long.'''
</P>
<P>
   The authors then place the blame squarely on the president for
the slow pace of the investigation. ``The president has pursued a
strategy of deceiving the American people and Congress in January
1998, delaying and impeding the criminal investigation for seven
months, and deceiving the American people and Congress again in
August 1998.''

CLINTON IS STILL THE STAR OF HOPE ... ARK.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LAURA VOZZELLA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOPE, Ark. _ The last time President Clinton visited his
hometown, for the funeral of his Uncle Buddy in June 1997, most of
Hope turned out on Main Street to cheer.
</P>
<P>
   Odie Stubblefield, an ex-Marine, saluted as the presidential
limousine passed. His sister cried.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, it just felt so good to see the president coming to
Hope,'' the sister, beauty shop owner Frances Mitchell, said
Friday. ``He drove right down the street. I had tears in my eyes,
and everybody was just standing out waving at the president. That
was one joyful morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Would they feel that way if Clinton passed through today, in the
midst of an embarrassing sex-and-lies scandal and calls for his
resignation?
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoot, yeah,'' said Mitchell, 53, her gray-haired brother
nodding in agreement. ``If he came down today, I'd throw him a
$1,000 bill if I had it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's fate may look grim in Washington, but hope springs
eternal in Hope and in Hot Springs, the other Arkansas town that
claims Clinton as a native son. Even folks who aren't fans of the
president believe that Clinton _ known to some in his home state as
``Slick Willie'' long before he hit the national scene _ might pull
another rabbit out of his Razorbacks cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pretty Teflon, and I think he'll be Teflon on this one,''
said Bob Shepherd, a 47-year-old native Arkansan who proudly notes,
``I've never voted for Bill Clinton my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at the wood-grain Formica counter at McClard's, the Hot
Springs barbecue joint that was a Clinton high school hangout,
Shepherd said inside-the-Beltway types fussing over the president's
infidelities don't understand Southern traditions of men and
mistresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a commonly accepted thing in the South. Slaves were
expensive,'' he said, and farmers needed more hands than one wife
could bear.
</P>
<P>
   There are modern reasons, too, for ignoring Clinton's affair
with Monica Lewinsky, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a businessman,'' Shepherd said. ``I don't care if he sits
buck naked at his desk and signs those bills, if he keeps the
economy going.''
</P>
<P>
   William Jefferson Blythe III was born in Hope on Aug. 19, 1946,
four months after his father was killed in a car wreck. He spent
his first seven years in ``America's Watermelon Patch'' before
moving to Hot Springs in 1953 with his mother and her new husband,
Buick dealer Roger Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   By all rights, Hot Springs should have the greater claim on
Clinton. The future president lived there longer _ through high
school. But a man skilled in semantics knew he didn't have a catchy
phrase with, ``I believe in a place called Hot Springs.'' ``A place
called Hope'' suddenly found itself on the map.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was Hope's opportunity. He did us a tremendous favor,''
said Gary Johnson, director of the Hope Visitor Center and Museum,
an old train depot decorated with Clinton family photos.
</P>
<P>
   The town of about 9,700, which had no need for a visitor center
before Clinton took office, now attracts 20,000 out-of-towners a
year. Tourists stop by the white house with the green trim where
Clinton lived as a boy, buy souvenirs at shops devoted to Clinton
memorabilia and pick up free copies of Hillary Clinton's chocolate
chip cookie recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson expressed a deep debt to President Clinton, but also a
frank determination that Hope will not get dragged down with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our part of the state is a poor, farming community, people
moving out,'' he said. ``There's opportunity here again, and for
that we will always owe President Clinton. And it's not gonna end
if his presidency ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``In truth,'' Johnson added, ``he lived here seven years. Hope
is a nice community that is trying to take advantage of the
opportunity that it's been given with the president of the United
States being from here. But as far as having a connection to
President Clinton personally, it's not there.''
</P>
<P>
   A few Hope residents admit being embarrassed by the Clinton
connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we go out of town and people ask, `Where are you
from?' and we say, `Hope,' they go, `Eeewww!,' '' said Krystal Cox,
16, a Hope High School junior.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of stigma does not hang so heavily over Hot Springs,
whose mineral waters drew tourists long before Bill Clinton came to
town. Clinton pill boxes and shot glasses compete with other
Arkansas souvenirs on gift shop shelves.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no getting away from Clinton completely.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Hochstetler, who lives in an Amish community in northern
Indiana, came to Hot Springs to take the waters. Preparing for the
train ride back with his family, he was filling dozens of plastic
jugs with spring water from a public fountain. It was their only
souvenir.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went in the bookstore; one shelf _ Clinton,'' said
Hochstetler, 81, waving his hand dismissively in front of his long,
gray beard.
</P>
<P>
   Other tourists made light of the Clinton connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you really think there's Viagra in this water?'' joked
Betty McLaughlin, 80, who waited for the Amish family to step away
from the fountain before making the crack.
</P>
<P>
   For some, especially in Hope, Clinton's problems are no laughing
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Music teacher Nell Garoy, 70, is praying that the Clinton
presidency will survive. If it doesn't, she said, he's welcome back
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has friends here,'' she said.

 WASHINGTON: in August 1998.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In perhaps the most damaging portion of the report, Starr's
prosecutors say that Clinton lied under oath on five occasions,
both in the Paula Jones deposition and his grand jury testimony
last month, when he denied that he had ``a sexual affair, a sexual
relationship or sexual relations'' with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But the report said that the president's response to lying under
oath rests on his own narrow definition of ``sexual relations'' _
``namely, that it requires sexual intercourse, no matter how
extensive the sexual activities might otherwise be,'' the report
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the president,'' the report says, ``a man could
regularly engage in oral sex and fondling of breasts and genitals
with a woman and yet not have a `sexual affair' with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky testified before the detail in much detail about
``substantial sexual activity'' that she said she engaged in with
Clinton, on 10 separate days in hallways, bathrooms and the
president's private study, from Nov. 15, 1995, to Dec. 28, 1997.
She said that Clinton made direct contact with her breasts and
genitalia.
</P>
<P>
   To corroborate her statements, prosecutors point to her own
testimony, and statements she made to 11 people. They also quote a
draft letter, gleaned from Ms. Lewinsky's home computer, in which
Ms. Lewinsky describes an incident in her relationship with the
president where she refers to ``watching your mouth on my breast''
and refers implicitly to direct contact with her genitalia.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky said that the president's ``hands-off policy''
suggests some kind of ``service contract _ that all I did was
perform oral sex on him and that that's all this relationship
was.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's testimony before the grand jury differed on several
points from Ms. Lewinsky's.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are free to infer that my testimony is that I did not have
sexual relations, as I understood this term to be defined,'' he
testified before the grand jury from the White House on Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor asked, ``Including touching her breast, kissing
her breast, touching her genitalia?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's correct,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even on Friday, in two separate documents, there was a dispute
between the White House and Starr about fundamental facts of the
relationship. In its 78-page rebuttal, the White House wrote that
the relationship began in early 1996 and in one incident in early
1997. But in the report, Starr said that Ms. Lewinsky testified
that their intimate relationship began on Nov. 15, 1995, during the
government shutdown when they engaged in oral sex while the
president spoke on the telephone with a congressman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The motive for the president to make a false statement about
the date on which the sexual relationship started appears to have
been that the president was unwilling to admit sexual activity with
a young 22-year-old White House intern in the Oval Office area.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr also accuses Clinton of lying under oath when he testified
that he could not recall instances when he was alone with Ms.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, they said that Ms. Lewinsky testified that she was alone
on numerous occasions with the president inside the Oval Office,
the president's private study, the private bathroom across from the
study and the hallway that leads from the Oval Office to the
private dining room.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr's prosecutors have other witnesses who testified that
the president and Ms. Lewinsky were alone together, including Betty
Currie, the president's personal secretary, six Secret Service
agents and a White House steward, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   In the obstruction of justice portion of the report, prosecutors
say that Clinton took an active role in attempting to hide his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky from the Jones lawyers and later
from Starr's investigators by concealing gifts they exchanged,
which had been subpoenaed.
</P>
<P>
   ``An effort to obstruct justice by withholding the truth from
the legal process _ whether by lying under oath, concealing
documents, or improperly influencing a witness's testimony _ is a
federal crime,'' prosecutors write in the report. ``There is
substantial and credible information that President Clinton engaged
in in such efforts to prevent the truth of his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky from being revealed in the Jones case.''
</P>
<P>
   The report charges Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky of devising ``cover
stories'' to conceal their relationship. When Ms. Lewinsky spoke
about how to answer questions about why she was transferred out of
the White House, Clinton told her, ``You could always say that the
people in Legislative Affairs got it for you or helped you get
it.''
</P>
<P>
   It also accuses the president of taking a far more acting role
in attempting to persuade Ms. Lewinsky to deny she had a
relationship with him in a sworn affidavit to be filed in the Jones
case.
</P>
<P>
   In his grand jury testimony, Clinton said, ``I hoped that this
relationship would never become public.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, Starr's prosecutors advance a motive for steps that the
president took to keep it quiet. They said that after the Supreme
Court's unanimous decision on May 27, 1997 to order the Jones case
to go forward, there was added risk to the president of his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky being found out.
</P>
<P>
   The report accuses Clinton of obstructing justice by suggesting
that Ms. Lewinsky file an affidavit denying that he had a
relationship so she would not be deposed by the Jones lawyers.
During his deposition, the president's lawyer, Robert Bennett, read
Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit denying a ``sexual relationship'' with the
president. A lawyer for Ms. Jones asked, ``Is that a true and
accurate statement as far as you know it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is absolutely true,'' the president replied.

</P>
<P>
   FEATURE Story
</P>
<P>
   EURO-CULTURAL-SEASON (Paris) _ In the wonderfully strict cycles
of life that make the French seem so predictable, la rentree first
announces itself each year as a reason to postpone things. From
early July, there is little that cannot await the return _ la
rentree _ to Paris in September. But, take note, this is not a
symptom of laziness. It is simply part of the French order of
things. Parisians hold parties to say goodbye for the summer in the
knowledge that social, cultural, political and business life will
resume with a vengeance a la rentree. So now, once again, Parisians
are back, hurriedly recovering control of their city from tourists,
adding frowns of impatience to still-bronzed faces, crowding
restaurants that felt no need to stay open in August to serve
foreigners. In every sense, a new season has arrived _ and all of
it meticulously linked to la rentree. By Alan Riding. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FILM AND VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   HAPPINESS-FILM (Undated) _ At a time when the news media are
awash in the gory details of presidential sexual hijinks, the
public is supposedly beyond shock when it comes to revelations of
bad behavior. Or is it? The acid test will come with the first
public American screenings of Todd Solondz's pitch-black comedy
``Happiness,'' at the New York Film Festival. ``Happiness,'' which
will be released in theaters on Oct. 16 by Good Machine, is a
gleeful, systematic demolition of the myth of the suburban idyll.
By Stephen Holden. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   JONATHAN-MYERS-FILMS (Undated) _ Once upon a time, the talk was
of the It Girl. These days, Jonathan Rhys Meyers has filmmakers
extolling what one might call the A Boy. The A, of course, stands
for androgynous, which is one quality _ an infectious smile and raw
talent are others _ that has the 21-year-old Irishman leading the
latest Anglo-Irish thespian wave. ``Johnny's fabulous to look at,''
said Ang Lee, who cast Rhys Meyers as a long-haired
villain-with-a-difference in his Civil War film, ``Ride With the
Devil,'' which is expected to be released in the spring,
co-starring Tobey Maguire and Jewel. By Matt Wolf. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   NIVOLA-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ Few actors, however successful, can
say that they have a museum in the family, but Alessandro Nivola,
26, can boast of two: one, devoted to his grandfather, the Italian
sculptor Constantino Nivola, is situated in the artist's hometown
in Sardinia, and a second, a far more modest and decidedly
unofficial archive in Manhattan, is devoted to the actor himself.
In his next movie, ``Best Laid Plans,'' a drama starring Reese
Witherspoon and Josh Brolin that is to be released next spring, he
plays a graduate student turned con artist, and in ``I Want You,''
a forthcoming British film by Michael Winterbottom that is set in
the seaside town of Hastings, Nivola plays a paroled murderer
seeking to rekindle a forbidden love affair _ a role he researched
by spending three days in Brixton prison in South London. By
Justine Elias. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   CIVIL-ACTION-FILM (Boston) _ Nonfiction books and films always
dance cheek to cheek with real life, of course. But ``A Civil
Action,'' a Disney movie that is to open on Dec. 25, based on the
acclaimed 1995 book by Jonathan Harr, has an unusually, uncannily
intimate relationship with reality. Perhaps the most intriguing
aspect of the success of the book and potential success of the
movie is this: In their depiction of a cluster of leukemia deaths
among children in the Boston suburb of Woburn and the large-scale
1986 legal battle that ensued over whether industrial pollution was
to blame, the reality they convey is not a comfortable or a simple
one. By Carey Goldberg. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   SAM-ROCKWELL-FILMS (Undated) _ Sam Rockwell is a master of the
quick change. The 29-year-old actor showed his range in January at
the Sundance Film Festival, where he was featured in not one but
three films. He appeared as the romantic, James Dean-like outcast
who mows lawns in John Duigan's ``Lawn Dogs,'' which opened in May;
he slouched across the screen as a hilariously inept safecracker in
John Hamburg's ``Safe Men,'' which opened in July, and he delivered
a chilling performance as a car-salesman-turned-hitman in Saul
Rubinek's dark comedy ``Jerry and Tom,'' which will also be shown
this month at the Toronto Film Festival. By Laura Winters. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; DARK-COMEDY-FILMS (Undated) _ This season's writers and
directors seem to agree that disturbing material can be a laughing
matter. Several fall releases _ also including ``Very Bad Things,''
``Clay Pigeons'' and ``Home Fries'' _ are self- proclaimed dark
comedies, By Ted Loos. (Moved).
 &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BIG-CHILL-FILM (Undated) _ Quick, think back to ``The Big
Chill,'' Lawrence Kasdan's 1983 comic drama about baby-boomer
friendship and dashed idealism, with the ghost of a Kevin Costner
performance left on the cutting-room floor. What is the first scene
that comes to mind? Of course: It's when the stars _ Glenn Close,
Kevin Kline, Jeff Goldblum, William Hurt, JoBeth Williams, Mary Kay
Place and Tom Berenger _ dance around the kitchen after a raucous
meal of pasta and wine, doing Chuck Berry duckwalks and modified
boogie-downs, washing dishes to the cranked-up sound of the
Temptations' ``Ain't Too Proud to Beg.'' The scene encapsulates the
spirit of the film: friendship forged in the footloose optimism of
the 60's; camaraderie instantly regained through the nostalgic
power of good pop music. Seen these days _ and it can be in a
15th-anniversary theatrical re-release, starting Nov. 6 _ ``The Big
Chill'' should also be acknowledged as the progenitor of pop
culture phenomena both insidious and salutory. By Ken Tucker.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   PRINCE-OF-EGYPT-FILM (Undated) _ To appeal to all age groups,
goes the perceived wisdom, an animated feature must include a
musical comedy format with at least one show-stopping song, funny
and cute sidekicks to the hero or heroine, an even balance of
laughter and tears, a fairy-tale setting and a romantic narrative
thrust. In 1998, Jeffrey Katzenberg is putting finishing touches on
``The Prince of Egypt,'' the first animated feature from
Dreamworks, the studio he founded with Steven Spielberg and David
Geffen. The subject is unusual for animation: nothing less than the
epic biblical story of Moses, adapted from the first half of
Exodus. The film, in fact, defiantly goes in the opposite direction
from the now-ingrained Disney pattern in nearly every way. In ``The
Prince of Egypt,'' there is no romantic fairy-tale narrative
engine, and, taking a cue from Spielberg, action-adventure is
emphasized over humor. By John Canemaker. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   CRUISE-GUIDE-FILM (New York) _ ``The Cruise,'' a documentary,
directed by Bennett Miller, opens on Oct. 23 at the Angelika Film
Center. Throughout 1996, Miller followed Timoty (Speed) Levitch _
who was in his fifth year of leading double-decker loops of
Manhattan, first with Apple Tours, then the Gray Line _ and entered
into the extraordinary rhythm of the guide's life. By Joe Neumaier.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   WITHERSPOON-FILMS (New York) _ Chatting in a TriBeCa restaurant,
Reese Witherspoon veered from such pensive asides to moments in
which she spoke giddily, even rhapsodically, about life as a
fledgling 22-year-old movie star. In one breath, she would gush
about how exciting it was to work with Paul Newman and Susan
Sarandon in the thriller ``Twilight,'' released earlier this year,
or to act opposite her boyfriend, Ryan Phillippe, in the
forthcoming ``Cruel Intentions,'' an updating of ``Les Liaisons
Dangereuses.'' In the next, she would lament the way that the news
media glorify her profession. By Elysa Gardner. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FRANKENHEIMER-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ With enduring films like
``Days of Wine and Roses,'' ``The Manchurian Candidate,'' ``Birdman
of Alcatraz,'' ``Seven Days in May'' and ``The Fixer'' to his
credit, John Frankenheimer was one of the foremost directors of the
1960s. But he stumbled under the weight of personal problems and
bad choices, and, starting in the 70s, his career went awry. For
filmmakers and actors who have made wrong decisions, few places are
as cruel as Hollywood. At the age of 68, with few illusions,
Frankenheimer is seeking to complete &UR;  &LR; a comeback this fall with a
large-scale action-thriller, ``Ronin,'' which opens on Sept. 25. By
Bernard Weinraub. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   NEW-FILMS-CHOICES (Undated) _ Movie directors, producers and
actors express their choices in upcoming films. By Michelle
Willens. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MONICA-POTTER-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ Monica Potter's first brush
with success happened half a lifetime ago in her hometown,
Cleveland, when she was a 13-year-old actress in a local television
commercial. In her first movie, ``Without Limits,'' which opened
Friday, Ms. Potter, now 27, portrays the reallife character of Mary
Marckx, a devoutly Roman Catholic college student in love with the
Olympic track star Steve Prefontaine, who died in a car crash in
1975 at the age of 24. By Justine Elias. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   THEATER
</P>
<P>
   BROADWAY-SEASON (New York) _ There are a few things I am looking
forward to this season with the sort of hopes that are usually
dangerous. These are centered on three actors who, though none have
been on Broadway recently, arrive with sterling pedigrees and in
roles that would seem to fit them like wet suits. Martin Short, the
comedian of a thousand professional alter-egos, will appropriately
be playing not one but a number of roles in the Roundabout Theater
Company's revival of the 1962 musical ``Little Me'' this fall. Judi
Dench, the great English actress who recently won American hearts
as a startlingly human Queen Victoria in the movie ``Mrs. Brown,''
returns to New York this spring in David Hare's London hit ``Amy's
View.'' And Kevin Spacey, the Academy- and Tony Award-winning actor
who defies the casting director's notions of ``type,'' is also due
this spring as Eugene O'Neill's dream-smashing salesman in ``The
Iceman Cometh,'' a role he played to feverish acclaim in London. By
Ben Brantley. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FOSSE-THEATER (Undated) _ Gwen Verdon and Ann Reinking are two
of the most respected performers to star on the American
musical-comedy stage in modern times. And Bob Fosse, the
choreographer and director, famously loved both women, as
individuals and as artists, showcasing them indelibly onstage and
on screen. Since Fosse's death in 1987 at the age of 60, Ms. Verdon
and Ms. Reinking have gone to the wall to insure that the spirit of
the man they knew would be kept vividly alive. This season, they
have collaborated as part of a team that is bringing ``Fosse: A
Celebration in Song and Dance'' to Broadway. By Mindy Aloff.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   DANCE
</P>
<P>
   EIFMAN-BALLET (Undated) _ Boris Eifman's choreography, like his
dancers, is passionate and intense: his Eifman Ballet of St.
Petersburg gave audiences a jolt when this 21-year-old Russian
troupe made its New York debut in April with provocative
psychodramas about Tchaikovsky and the ballerina Olga Spessivtseva.
When the Eifman Ballet returns to City Center Jan. 19 through 31,
it will be easier to see why Eifman's highly expressive use of the
ballet idiom is so dramatic and stunning. ``The Karamazovs,'' his
two-act treatment of Dostoyevsky's ``Brothers Karamazov'' is a
distilled if graphic essay on the novel's themes. By Anna
Kisselgoff. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-SERIES-SEASON (New York) _ Many of us in New York complain
yearly about pandering repertory and incoherent programs, but
solutions are arriving from every side. I hope the public responds,
because music this season is being served with a sense of adventure
unusual to the decade. The watchword is ``series,'' and there are a
lot of them: coherent looks at either individuals or ideas. By
Bernard Holland. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-EVENTS-CHOICES (Undated) _ Music directors, singers and
musicians express their choices in upcoming music events. By David
Mermelstein. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   POP MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   MORISSETTE-ALBUM (Undated) _ The aftershocks from Alanis
Morissette's ``Jagged Little Pill'' haven't subsided since the
album was released in 1995. In one pop-culture masterstroke, the
album introduced a mainstream audience to what punks, post-punks,
riot grrrls and alternative rockers had been shouting for more than
a decade: that women were angry, intelligent, carnal, sick of being
victims and ready to speak for themselves. Ms. Morissette's new
album is due for release on Nov. 3, and advance information is
scarce; she has not even revealed the album's title. By Jon
Pareles. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   NEW-POP-ALBUMS (Undated) _ Popular musicians offer their
assessment of upcoming music albums. By Dimitri Ehrlich. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MELISSA-ELLIOTT-MUSIC (Undated) _ Melissa Elliott _ singer,
songwriter, rapper and producer _ sat before a mammoth stereo
system in the offices of her record label, Elektra. She
contemplated a pile of compact disks, digital audio tapes and
promotional videos. Which would best demonstrate where this artist,
whom the world knows by her deceptively girlish family nickname of
Missy, is headed in the wake of her emergence, at 26, as a new
ideal of womanly black power? By Ann Powers. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ART
</P>
<P>
   ARCHITECTS-SEASON (Undated) _ Money, movies, missiles, malls and
madness: the time approaches when these may be the only first-rate
items the United States will continue to turn out for international
consumption. There will be nothing but one vast continental sprawl
anchored by two buildings, one on either coast: the Pentagon, and
the new theater for the Academy Awards on Hollywood Boulevard,
which breaks ground this fall. By Herbert Muschamp. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   POLLOCK-MONET-ART (Undated) _ How specifically ``American'' were
Jackson Pollock's pictures? It's fitting that two of the big shows
this fall are the Pollock retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art
in New York City in November and the late Monet show at the Museum
of Fine Arts in Boston this month. By Michael Kimmelman. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   CELEBS-TV-SHOWS (Undated) _ Television stars express their
choices in television for the fall. By Jill Gerston. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TV-FAMILY-SHOWS (Undated) _ What can it mean that the two most
enticing new series of the season are about families in distress?
You can construct theories that are high-blown (the shows reflect
the instability of the American family) or commonplace (a plot
needs some conflict). A more likely explanation is that these
series display brave satirical wit, which might explode the snuggly
confines of the domestic sitcom, that most pedestrian and
widespread of television genres. By Caryn James. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES
</P>
<P>
   BOOKS-ASIAN-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ Forget that books are
endangered by the computer and that Asian art is collected mostly
by Asians. Both are on the minds of the nation's curators, who have
assembled some of the strongest and most diverse selections of such
works ever shown in this country. By Rita Reif. (Moved).

   PAPERBACKS (Undated) (Moved.)

   TRAVEL-EUROPE-SEASON (London) _ A new train to the plane is a

An old master's house adds masterly touches. By Marlise Simons.
(Paris) _ Paris gets a new subway line for a new century. By Craig
R. Whitney. (All Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-EUROPE-MUSIC (Undated) _ Most musical visitors to Europe
this fall will want to see the great opera houses and hear the
outstanding orchestras _ the Vienna Philharmonic, the Berlin
Philharmonic, the Royal Concertgebouw _ on home ground. But just as
enticing are the opportunities to hear refreshingly adventurous
performances. By Paul Griffiths. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-EUROPE-THEATER (London) _ London revs up for the fall.
The Royal Shakespeare Company will be back at its London home, the
Barbican, from October onward. Both ``The Invention of Love'' and
``The Weir'' are due in the West End. And there are major
performances in the offing, especially from British actresses.
Diana Rigg, who earned a Tony as Euripides' baleful Medea, has just
opened as Racine's lovelorn Phedre at the Albery; and soon she will
be joined on the London stage by Judi Dench as the title character
in Eduardo de Filippo's ``Filumena'' and Helen Mirren as a
Cleopatra feistily in love with Alan Rickman's Antony. By Benedict
Nightingale. (Moved).

   TRAVEL-BRIEFS (Undated) _ Monet, with a mint on the pillow, in
Boston; In London, new home for Sadler's Wells; A fast feery speeds

Palazzos and chalets invite (paying) guests. (Moved).

COWBOYS SEEKING END TO LOSING ROAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ After burying their five-game losing streak with
a season-opening victory against the Arizona Cardinals, the Cowboys
head into Denver hoping to buck another unsightly trend from last
season _ poor play on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys were considered road warriors during their run to
three Super Bowls in four seasons, fashioning a 24-8 record on the
road from 1992-1995. The record dipped to 4-4 in 1996 before
bottoming out at 1-7 last season.
</P>
<P>
   Safety Darren Woodson admitted that as the losses mounted away
from Texas Stadium, the team's confidence dipped.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys receiver Michael Irvin, who formerly relished playing on
the road because it fostered a close-knit environment and built
team unity, doesn't know if the team lost confidence on the road.
But he said the losing certainly sapped the fun out of playing on
the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``You lose the fun when you lose the winning,'' Irvin said.
``But I never realized we had such a horrible road record until it
was all said and done. It's not something when you are right in the
midst of the storm that you realize how bad the storm is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we know that, we take that knowledge into this year.
We say let's make sure we don't go through it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin said the key to reversing their road woes is staying
focused and playing with poise. No decision on Lett Cowboys coach
Chan Gailey said a final decision won't be made on defensive tackle
Leon Lett's playing status for tomorrow's matchup with the Broncos
until right before kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   Lett has been slowed this week by soreness in his left knee,
which he sprained four weeks ago. However, he practiced yesterday
for the second consecutive day after sitting out Wednesday's
practice.
</P>
<P>
   If he plays, Lett, who is listed as probable, will split time
with Hurvin McCormack at tackle and play defensive end on passing
downs.
</P>
<P>
   Factored into the decision is whether the Cowboys should hold
Lett out of the Broncos game and save him for the NFC East game
against the New York Giants a week from Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said it will also be a game-time decision on receiver
Ernie Mills, who has been hampered by a sprained left foot. If
Mills can't go, Gailey said rookie free-agent receiver Jeff Ogden
will take his place in the Cowboys' four-receiver sets.

CLINTON FUND-RAISER IS LOYALTY TEST FOR DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Despite anxiety among New York Democrats that
President Clinton's difficulties may undermine hopes of unseating a
Republican governor and U.S. senator this fall, the three major
Democratic Senate candidates say they plan to appear at Clinton's
side at a Manhattan fund-raiser on the eve of Tuesday's primary.
</P>
<P>
   But two other important New York Democrats _ state Comptroller
Carl McCall and Peter Vallone, the New York City council speaker
and a candidate for governor _ said they would not attend Clinton's
event to raise money for national Democratic campaigns. A spokesman
for McCall said the comptroller would be the host at his own
fund-raiser in Albany that evening. Vallone said he would be unable
to appear with the president because of other campaign obligations,
though he was unable to say immediately what they were.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when Democratic candidates and their aides are
scrambling to determine whether _ or how much _ Clinton's
difficulties will color the races here, the president's scheduled
appearance at a series of national Democratic fund-raisers on
Monday has provided an early, and for some candidates unwanted,
test of their loyalty to Clinton. As Republicans followed with
obvious pleasure, Democratic candidates tried to navigate the
conflicting obligations of trying to appear loyal to a president
who has long been popular in this state _ particularly among the
kind of Democrat who will vote next week _ with the emerging
consensus that Clinton's difficulties would undercut whomever the
party nominates to run against Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and Gov. George
Pataki this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The situation was further complicated by the fact that New York
Democratic officials are angry at national Democrats for scheduling
a fund-raiser on the eve of the primary. Clinton's appearance, New
York Democrats said, would draw funds out of the state while
overshadowing the candidates themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Before the independent prosecutor, Kenneth Starr, delivered his
report on the Monica Lewinsky matter, only one of the Democratic
candidates for Senate, Charles Schumer, had said he would
definitely attend Clinton's event. But on Thursday evening, the
other two major Democrats, Geraldine Ferraro and Mark Green, said
they, too, would at least try to stop by, notwithstanding other
primary-eve demands.
</P>
<P>
   In the gubernatorial race, Betsy McCaughey Ross, one of
Vallone's rivals, said she planned to be in Buffalo that evening,
but would try to return to New York in time to attend. Another
candidate, James Larocca, was not planning to attend. There was no
word Friday night on whether a fourth candidate, Charles Hynes,
would attend.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, D-Manhattan, is planning to
attend, an aide said.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates discussed their plans at a time of intense
anxiety among Democrats, who found themselves planning the fall
campaigns against a political backdrop that seems increasingly
likely to be defined by the response to Starr's report. Democrats
and Republicans said it was unlikely that Clinton's problems would
have any noticeable effect on the primary for governor or senator.
</P>
<P>
   But the general election was another matter: members of both
parties said recent events would almost surely depress turnout
among Democrats, distract from the campaigns and force candidates
to answer questions they would prefer to avoid.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Several Republican strategists said they were eagerly awaiting
the president's arrival, expecting candidates to be photographed at
the president's side, an image that one Republican strategist said
could be harmful to the candidates in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   A number of the Democrats dismissed such assertions, including
Vallone, who said he had no concern that Clinton could hurt his
campaign. The speaker said he would be unable to join Clinton for
any of his events that day, which include a luncheon, a dinner and
a performance of ``The Lion King,'' because of the demands of the
primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them from the beginning, I have a very important
election here,'' Vallone said in an interview. Asked what he would
be doing when Clinton was in town, Vallone responded: ``God only
knows _ I haven't the foggiest idea. They change my schedule every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ferraro said that she would make every effort to attend,
though she left no question that she, too, considered it an
imposition. The event, an afternoon of fund-raisers that is
expected to raise more than $3.6 million, is the third in a series
of ``Unity '98'' events being sponsored by the Democratic National
Committee and the campaign committees to elect Democrats to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can possibly be there, I will,'' Ms. Ferraro said. ```But
I'm not going to stay for the show, and sit there for three hours
the night before the primary. I was not a happy camper about
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the candidates, it is Schumer, D-Brooklyn, whose
candidacy could be most complicated by Clinton's troubles. That is
because Schumer is on the House Judiciary Committee, and could be
forced to go to Washington for hearings, should impeachment
proceedings begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I will have to live up to my responsibilities as a
member of the Judiciary Committee,'' he said. ``One of my
responsibilities as a member of the Judiciary Committee is not to
make premature statements and jump the gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said he had no reservations about appearing with
Clinton, and said he did not think Clinton's difficulties would
have any effect on the race. ``I think this race will be decided
because the voters have decided that Al D'Amato has been there too
long,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Green also said he was not concerned about appearing with the
president. ``It crossed and then left my mind,'' he said. ``This
issue is hurtful to the president and his family and the country.
But appreciate that if character and ethics rise to be a top issue
this fall, it sure doesn't help Al D'Amato.''

FURTIVE GLANCES, AND THE REST IS NOW HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Some content may be objectionable to some readers.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY AND MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is said to have begun, as these things often do,
with a furtive glance, a flirtatious exchange, a stolen kiss at a
moment of vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   The day was Wednesday, Nov. 15, 1995. The government was
shuttered in a budget showdown between the White House and the
Congress. The West Wing was virtually empty of its typical
collection of aides and officials.
</P>
<P>
   It was there and then, according to the independent counsel's
report, that President Clinton and intern Monica S. Lewinsky snuck
away to a windowless hallway off the Oval Office and launched into
a sexual relationship that would span 16 months and eventually
threaten to end the Clinton presidency midway through its second
term.
</P>
<P>
   By any estimation, it was a lurid, unseemly affair, one that
unfolded around the Oval Office with Clinton's secretary, Betty
Currie, often sitting knowingly nearby, while Clinton's wife,
Hillary Rodham Clinton, was often on political missions to distant
cities. It was centered around oral sex, which Clinton usually
stopped just short of completion.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lewinsky's account, she was often ushered through
the maze of West Wing hallways and into the Oval Office so that
some of Clinton's closest and most disapproving aides would not see
her. Once she waited in the pouring rain in a White House parking
lot. Most encounters happened on weekends, when the West Wing was
virtually barren.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many extramarital affairs, it included breakups, petty
jealousies, heated arguments, uneven emotional investments, a
steady exchange of thoughtful gifts. Sometimes it appeared white
hot, while other times Lewinsky tried in vain to restart something
that was destined to fail.
</P>
<P>
   On that first day, the way Lewinsky tells it, the chemistry
between the president and the intern bubbled out of control. She
was working in the chief of staff's office _ the unpaid help at a
time of government crisis. Clinton came down to attend an informal
birthday gathering for a midlevel aide. The two of them, who had
exchanged glances and provocative comments in the hallways for a
few months, stood alone in chief of staff Leon Panetta's office and
flirted, so much so that Lewinsky gave Clinton a glance at her
lingerie.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at around 8 p.m., when Lewinsky walked to the restroom,
she passed George Stephanopoulos' office, where Clinton sat inside
alone. He beckoned her in, and they walked through a back door into
a private hallway just off the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked briefly and sort of acknowledged that there had been
a chemistry that was there before and that we were both attracted
to each other and then he asked me if he could kiss me,'' Lewinsky
said in her grand jury testimony this summer. So they kissed, and
Lewinsky jotted down her name and telephone number on a piece of
paper and gave it to the president, as if the two had just met at a
cocktail lounge.
</P>
<P>
   At 10 p.m. that same night, Clinton walked down to the chief of
staff's office again and invited Lewinsky back to Stephanopoulos'
office. They met, and this time walked into a small, darkened study
off the Oval Office, where Clinton fondled her breasts and touched
her genital area, according to the report. When a telephone call
came through, Clinton talked with a member of Congress while
Lewinsky performed oral sex on him. He stopped her, according to
the report, before she was done.
</P>
<P>
   It would prove, oddly, to be a fateful night in the history of
the republic _ the start of the potential end of the Clinton
presidency. Eventually, Clinton would summon some of his closest
friends, including Vernon E. Jordan Jr. and high-level government
officials, among them UN Ambassador Bill Richardson, to help find
the young intern a job in New York, all while the Paula Jones
sexual harassment lawsuit unfolded around him.
</P>
<P>
   The affair and its timing posed enormous risks for Clinton. He
was already under suspicion in the Jones case. His reelection
campaign loomed in the near future. Still, just two nights later,
Lewinsky delivered some pizza to the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   While on the phone, ``he unzipped his pants and exposed
himself,'' Lewinsky said in her testimony, and she performed oral
sex. Later, Clinton said to her, ``I'm usually around on weekends.
No one else is around, and you can come and see me,'' according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
   And that was how the relationship continued, with Lewinsky
stealing away to the Oval Office on Saturdays and Sundays, as
skeptical Secret Service officers stood outside. Many aides
suspected the affair, according to the report, among them then
deputy chief of staff Evelyn Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Lewinsky, who was hired as a full-time aide in the
White House, occasionally made plans to meet in the hallway so he
could invite her into the office. In one encounter, Lewinsky
complained to Clinton that he never asked her about her life, so
the two began having more intimate discussions.
</P>
<P>
   In their respective appearances before the grand jury, Lewinsky
testified that the relationship began as a physical affair and
blossomed into an emotional relationship; Clinton said it began as
a friendship and became intimate. In his testimony, Clinton denied
having sexual contact with Lewinsky in 1995, while she was still an
intern.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until April 1996 that the relationship stalled.
Lewinsky was transferred to the Pentagon by suspicious aides,
specifically Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   It was Easter Sunday, April 7, 1996, when Lewinsky told the
president she had been transferred to the Pentagon. ``I was never
going to see the president again,'' Lewinsky recalled thinking at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who had been mourning the death of his friend, Commerce
Secretary Ron Brown, called Lewinsky at home and invited her to the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do they have to take you away from me?,'' Clinton said,
according to Lewinsky. ``I trust you. I promise that if I win in
November I'll bring you back like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky and Clinton did not have a private meeting for the rest
of 1996. But the president called her, and the two had phone sex at
least seven times, often when Hillary Rodham Clinton was out of
town. During a Sept. 5, 1996, phone conversation, Lewinsky told the
president she wanted to have intercourse, the report said. But
Clinton ``responded that he could not do so because of the possible
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Should he stop calling? the president asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Lewinsky replied.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, Lewinsky saw Clinton at some public events. When
she saw Clinton wearing a tie she had given him, she said, ``Hey
handsome, I like your tie.'' Clinton called her that night and told
her to stop by, but Lewinsky didn't see him because Lieberman was
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky was frustrated and felt her chances of working again at
the White House were diminishing, the report said. ``I can't
understand what went wrong,'' Lewinsky wrote in an e-mail to a
friend in early 1997. On Valentine's Day 1997, Lewinsky published a
``Love Note'' in the Washington Post entitled ``Handsome.''
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen days later, Clinton and Lewinsky had their first sexual
encounter in nearly 11 months, the report said. The president had
just finished giving a radio address about drug abuse, saying, ``We
must give our children the straight facts.'' Then he met with
Lewinsky, who was wearing a Navy blue dress from the Gap.
</P>
<P>
   In the president's study, Lewinsky ``pestered him to kiss me,
because...it had been a long time since we had been alone. ...''
</P>
<P>
   The president gave Lewinsky a special edition of Walt Whitman's
``Leaves of Grass'' and some other gifts. Then the two kissed and
Lewinsky performed oral sex on Clinton, the report said. Lewinsky
testified that she asked the president to ejaculate, which he had
not done previously. ``I don't want to disappoint you,'' Clinton
said, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   The next time Lewinsky took out the dress, she noticed the
president's semen stains, which provided the DNA evidence that
Starr's report said proves they had a sexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton later testified that ``I was sick after it was over...I
promised myself it wasn't going to happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   But it did happen again, on March 29, 1997, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
   In April or May 1997, Clinton became worried that Lewinsky had
told her mother about the relationship. Lewinsky lied and said she
had not, the report said. On May 24, Clinton is alleged to have
told her the relationship was over. He told her he had ``hundreds
of affairs'' before he turned 40 years old, the report said, but
more recently had tried to be faithful.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, in tears, left the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on July 4, Lewinsky returned to the White House and
complained about her inability to get a new job.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Clinton scolded her, according to Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's illegal,'' Clinton admonished the former intern, ``to
threaten the president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lewinsky openly fantasized to Clinton about what it would
be like to be married to him at some future point. At the time,
Clinton, according to Lewinsky, was toying with her hair, stroking
her arm and praising her beauty. He kissed her, although they
didn't engage in sex.
</P>
<P>
   The report quoted Lewinsky's thoughts: ``I left that day sort of
emotionally stunned,'' for ``I just knew he was in love with me.''

<P>
   Birmingham, Ala. -- Looking back across 35 years, the ordinary
beginning of Sept. 15, 1963, at Sixteenth Street Baptist Church
still strikes the Rev. John Cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a regular Sunday morning,'' says the retired minister,
who now lives in Decatur.
</P>
<P>
   The church was about to have its first of a series of monthly
youth Sundays, introduced by Cross to make the children of the
church feel valued. Girls wearing white dresses and boys in white
shirts and dark pants would usher, sing and make announcements from
the pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   Denise McNair, 11, and Carole Robertson, Cynthia Wesley and
Addie Mae Collins, all 14, crowded into the women's lounge in the
basement of the church to primp before worship began at 11 a.m.
Carole wore a brand-new pair of shoes, her first pair with heels.
Addie Mae was a bit disheveled from frolicking with her sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the church wall, beside the stone staircase, the fuses
on a bundle of dynamite burned.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday planned to celebrate the church's young people was
about to become a day to mourn them.
</P>
<P>
   Cross, in the sanctuary where the Ladies' Bible Class was
studying forgiveness, thought the water heater in the church
kitchen had blown up. The odor finally told him that explosives,
not gas, had rocked the church.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the minister made his way outside, several hundred
people had gathered. Ignoring warnings that another charge might go
off, Cross and several church members began digging through the
rubble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Less than two feet down, we found the first body,'' he said.
``The other three were right beneath it.''
</P>
<P>
   Denise, Carole, Cynthia and Addie Mae became icons in the
struggle for civil rights. According to many observers, their
deaths marked a turning point in the movement, displaying to the
nation the depth of hatred that could deny a people fair treatment.
Other violence in the aftermath took two more lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the awakening,'' said veteran newsman Walter Cronkite
in ``4 Little Girls,'' a Spike Lee documentary on the bombing just
released on video.
</P>
<P>
   Thrust into limelight of movement
</P>
<P>
   Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, which claims to be the oldest
organized black congregation in Birmingham, had been thrust by
accident, fate or providence into the limelight of the civil rights
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Organized in 1873 as the First Colored Baptist Church of
Birmingham, the church was known as a congregation of educated
members. The city's first black bank was organized by a Sixteenth
Street pastor, and the homes of many black families were built by a
contractor who was a member there.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation built its first building _ a Gothic Revival
red-brick structure with an impressive steeple _ in the late 1800s,
but city officials condemned it and ordered it razed about 25 years
later.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, members replaced it with the present building,
designed by black architect and Macon native Wallace A. Rayfield
and completed in 1911. Its Romanesque and Byzantine lines feature
twin towers with pointed domes.
</P>
<P>
   For years the church grew and prospered, at one time claiming
almost 1,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s when some churches took up leadership in the civil
rights movement, records of Sixteenth Street show little discussion
of segregation. Another church's minister, the Rev. Fred Lee
Shuttlesworth of Bethel Baptist Church, took the lead in organizing
the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights to achieve
``freedom and democracy and the removal from our society of any
form of second-class citizenship.''
</P>
<P>
   While ministers and members of other congregations were more
outspoken than the people of Sixteenth Street, the historic old
church had two advantages that made it appealing for organizational
meetings: its size, seating 1,600, and its location across from a
city park.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1962, when Cross accepted a call to the ministry of
Sixteenth Street, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was already
considering an invitation to come to Birmingham where infamous
Commissioner Bull Conner held sway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first night I attended a mass meeting of the local group,
it was announced that Dr. King and his staff would be coming soon
to Birmingham,'' recalled Cross, an Arkansas native educated in
Virginia. ``I was asked at the first meeting I went to, 'Would it
be possible to meet in your church?'''
</P>
<P>
   With the eyes of the audience staring at him waiting for an
answer, Cross felt he could not defer to consult with his deacons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just bowed my head and said, 'Yes,''' he said. ``The next
meeting was held at Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, and they
thought I had given them permission to hold every meeting there.''
</P>
<P>
   Cross had some moments of uneasiness when few of his members
attended the meetings held at the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would confuse any pastor when he feels he has joined up
with something the majority of his members could care less about,''
said Cross, ``but the city needed a group as forthright as Dr. King
and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference staff to break
down the walls. They needed to be broken down in Birmingham.''
</P>
<P>
   After the bombing, Cross sensed that some members of the church
blamed King for the bombing and Cross for letting King come into
the church.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after the church was rebuilt and King wanted to use the
building again, some members ``got fighting mad,'' Cross said. But
the church voted to issue an invitation to King and the controversy
soon died down.
</P>
<P>
   Cross stayed on as pastor of Sixteenth Street until 1968, when
he took a job with the Southern Baptists in Alabama working in
campus ministry at Alabama State University. From there he moved to
Decatur where he became associate pastor of Oakhurst Baptist Church
for seven years, then joined the staff of the Atlanta Baptist
Association. He retired in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even now, my life is not back to normalcy,'' Cross said. ``I
sit at my window a lot of nights with the lights off.''
</P>
<P>
   'Shrine or an active congregation?'
</P>
<P>
   While Cross moved on, division, ministerial turnover and
membership decline plagued Sixteenth Street.
</P>
<P>
   The building was in disrepair and fewer than 100 people attended
services most Sundays in 1990 when the Rev. Christopher M. Hamlin
took the pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   Hamlin, 38, a Macon native and Morehouse College graduate, said
he was surprised to be considered for a job at a church as historic
as Sixteenth Street as such a young man. He soon became aware of
the challenges he faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last three pastors before I came were somewhat stormy
pastorates,'' he said. ``Many members left and joined other
churches. When I came it was an older congregation. They had a few
young adults and teenagers and children here, but not many. The
church was, I really thought, on its last leg.''
</P>
<P>
   But along with the difficulties, Hamlin came to realize the
potential at Sixteenth Street: An average of nearly 90,000 visitors
each year came through the church building and the city of
Birmingham planned to build a new Civil Rights Institute across the
street.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wonderful opportunity to evaluate all that and see,
like the phoenix, how we might rise and find a way of attracting
new members,'' said Hamlin.
</P>
<P>
   Under Hamlin's leadership, the congregation increased. Worship
services now average 350 to 400 people and the membership roll has
swelled to 525, who drive into town from throughout metropolitan
Birmingham. They are drawn not by the church's history but its
mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither of us was born when the major part of the civil rights
movement was going on,'' said Ane Debro, 28, an assistant district
attorney who joined the church with her husband, Mark, seven years
ago. ``After we became more involved in the church, we paid more
attention to its history.''
</P>
<P>
   The Debros were attracted by the ``family'' atmosphere of the
church where everyone seemed to know and care about everyone else,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Their son, John Mark, 14 months, is ``the first of our baby
boom'' at Sixteenth Street, his mother said. ``Since he was born,
we have had six babies and four on the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The church has a tour ministry run by volunteers, many of them
retired people, who host the 2,000 visitors a week now walking
through.
</P>
<P>
   Members have pledged $1.1 million of an estimated $2.5 million
needed to renovate the building.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's ``4 Little Girls'' took the church's legacy to a wide
audience via Home Box Office. And Hamlin has written a history of
the church, ``Behind the Stained Glass,'' published this year.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Chambliss, convicted of bombing the church in 1977, died
in prison in 1985. He was the only person ever charged. Last year,
the FBI and the Birmingham police announced that they had reopened
the investigation and once again has been drawn to the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we a shrine or an active congregation?'' Hamlin asked
rhetorically. ``We are an active congregation who try to involve
ourselves in the community in ways that make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hamlin came to the church in 1990, he said, he made a
10-year commitment to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own personal goal is to have the congregation grow to about
700 members by 2000,'' he said. ``I think we're on target for that.
Other than membership growth, my goal is to preserve this historic
structure in the city. Hopefully by 2000 we will complete our
capital campaign and renovation of this church.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamlin said he also is looking at the role the church should
play in the continuing struggle for civil rights and racial
understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``In light of what happened at this church in 1963, it would
have been easy for African-Americans and this congregation to
retaliate,'' he said. ``But our congregation has always opened its
arms to a pluralistic community and said let's find common ground.
We're looking at how to live that out in our community.''

 &HT;    American of all faiths are praying for Clinton
 &HT;    By Benjamin Kline
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio -- At the Wednesday night prayer meeting at the
Patterson Park Church , 35 members fell to their knees to pray for
President Clinton, for the nation and for the members of Congress
who must deal with the fallout from Clinton's admitted adultery
with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Dale Kurtz, pastor of the large Protestant congregation
at 3655 E. Patterson Road, explained the group usually prays while
seated in chairs. The lowering Wednesday, he said, symbolized the
depth of concern about ``a dark day in the history of our
country.''
</P>
<P>
   On a weekend when the nation seemed to be wallowing in murky
disclosures of a White House that became a house of shame,
religious leaders are trying to look past the dirty laundry to the
clear blue sky of heavenly forgiveness and redemption.
</P>
<P>
   But they're not ignoring what's been hung out on the
clothesline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a tension between the sense of forgiveness that we can
give, that God gives, and the need to deal with the consequences of
the things he (Clinton) did wrong,'' said the Rev. Glenn Leupold,
associate pastor of Westminster Presbyterian Church.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the Presbyterian influence on America's founding fathers,
Leupold cited the ``historic Presbyterian belief that rarely do we
do something that's 100 percent good. We know people do wrong; it's
part of human nature to make mistakes. ``
</P>
<P>
   But is Clinton for real in his contrition? Skepticism abounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do pray for him,'' said Rabbi Samuel Press of Beth Abraham
synagogue. ``I hope he is genuine and that God forgives him. I do
believe he can be a new person, can aspire to the fine role that he
speaks of in his future.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Press said he's thoroughly disgusted with the
cynicism demonstrated by the president's efforts to stall and
obfuscate the grand jury investigation and by ``the total
exploitation of women'' in the affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in the potential of every person to change,'' Press
said. ``But when the lawyers and the PR people come in, then we see
a new Clinton. He has created this aura of distrust. It's not so
much the sexual matters; it's the arrogance, lying and exploitation
of women.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the one to judge Clinton's situation,'' said the Rev.
Paul Mitchell of Dayton's Revival Center Ministries. ``The church
and the ministers of God should not condemn the president, but
should pray for him.''
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to the morality of recent disclosures,
Mitchell said, ``We are living in the last days. The morals in this
country _ not just in the White House _ shows us it's all over. The
Bible says it starts from the head down. God is just now
uncovering, exposing, letting the country see that whenever you
turn your back on Him, you won't make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurtz sees a parallel between Clinton and King Saul, the
Biblical ruler who ``was warned about his transgression and sin and
tried to justify it. Finally he admitted it, but his life did not
change as a result. We pray that (Clinton) will come to some kind
of understanding of how serious this whole matter of character and
moral leadership and integrity is.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinner repent, then?
</P>
<P>
   ``Repentance is not just standing up and saying you're sorry,''
Kurtz declared. ``Repentance is a change of direction. ``

 &HT;    Tax credit award bias denied
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ State housing officials on Friday denied charges
leveled by three Austin developers that they passed over worthy
housing projects and instead awarded millions of dollars in tax
credits to developers with no experience or bad credit.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs has been
buffeted by other troubles in recent months. The FBI and the Texas
Rangers are investigating allegations that Florita Bell Griffin
profited from her position on the board that doles out the federal
credits. In June, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development criticized the agency for failing to spend federal
money that was supposed to be used for housing for the poor. The
director of the agency, Larry Paul Manley, resigned several weeks
ago. Last month, the agency granted federal tax credits worth about
$280 million over 10 years to the developers of 55 proposed
projects. The credits are an incentive for developers to build
low-cost housing, and a portion of the units that are built must be
reserved for people making 60 percent or less of median income,
which in Austin equals $30,480 for a family of four.
</P>
<P>
   The competition for the credits is fierce. About four times as
many people apply for the credits as get them. State housing
officials consider economic feasibility, location and other factors
in choosing recipients.
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Bobinchuck, Donald Hammond, and Tim Merriwether say
the board gave the tax breaks to certain developers even after
being warned by agency staff that they had bad credit or little
experience. They want an audit of this year's process to determine
whether favoritism played a role in the board's decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to come off as some hysterical crybaby,'' Hammond
said. ``I'm not a political kind of guy. But these are federal
dollars. These aren't their dollars to play with and it's wrong.
It's just wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobinchuck said the developers have ``a fairly good pile of
documentation'' that supports their case.
</P>
<P>
   State officials had a different interpretation of the records,
however, and suggested that the developers are upset that their
projects didn't make the cut this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we can tell, after reviewing the files, we don't see
that there's been any favoritism, said board chairman Don Bethel.
``They got credits last year and didn't question the process. They
didn't get credits this year, and they are questioning the process.
I don't know what (that) tells you.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherno Njie, who oversees the tax credit program, said the
agency often awards credits to developers with less than perfect
applications. He said the staff recommendations cited by the three
developers are just one piece of a more intricate selection
process.
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials also discounted criticism over the unspent
federal money, noting that while they've only spent $100 million of
the $184 million they've gotten as part of the program in question,
they have allocated 97 percent of it and are in no danger of having
to return any of it to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in no danger of losing any of those dollars as of Sept.
11, 1998,'' said agency spokesman Brian Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Griffin investigation, Montgomery said the board
member is innocent until proven guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Some people who aren't involved in the tax credit dispute
suggested that the developers' charges may have merit. Walter
Moreau of Central Texas Mutual Housing, an Austin-based non-profit
organization that has competed successfully for the tax credits,
said the decision-making process has been criticized before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every year for the last five years there have been
developers shut out of the process that have threatened lawsuits _
but that doesn't mean that they don't perhaps have a legitimate
point,'' Moreau said.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Harryette Ehrhardt, D-Dallas, who sits on the House
panel that oversees the housing department, said the tax credit
decisions should be more open to the public. Ehrhardt said she
wasn't surprised by the latest allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had information from the auditors and from staff persons,
as well as from individuals who had not been funded, that indicated
that such as thing as was reported was possible,'' she said.

 &HT;    Frances clobbers Houston, Galveston
 &HT;    By Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ After ducking and bobbing in the Gulf of Mexico on
Thursday, Tropical Storm Frances sloshed ashore early Friday,
dragging along torrential rains that hammered Galveston and Houston
and caused one death in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Packing 65 mph winds, Frances made landfall about 1 a.m. near
Refugio, north of Corpus Christi _ close to where Tropical Storm
Charley hit on Aug. 22. But while Charley quickly broke down over
land, Frances maintained tropical-storm strength Friday and
unexpectedly stalled near Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   A flash flood watch remains in effect through today for Austin,
the Hill Country, and much of south central and southeast Texas.
The remains of the storm were expected to crawl across Austin
today, but the system's unfocused center was not expected to
produce the flooding forecasters had feared for Austin or the
Highland Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Frances has yet to perform as expected _ keeping local
forecasters on their toes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This storm is way too close to let our guard down,'' said Bob
Rose, meteorologist for the Lower Colorado River Authority. ``If it
swings west only 50 miles or so, that could put some heavy rains
right into the Highland Lakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The LCRA River Operations Center went on a 24-hour schedule
Friday, monitoring rainfall and water levels in the Colorado River
and its tributaries. Up and down the river, residents and
businesses were told to brace for possible heavy rain and rapidly
rising water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like this weather pattern,'' Rose said. ``If the
storm moves into the Hill Country and stalls, we could have some
real trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin received just over 2 inches of rain between midnight and
7 p.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The National Hurricane Center in Miami expects the storm to move
slowly north, crossing Austin around noon today, Waco on Sunday and
the Red River on Monday. Some forecasters, however, wouldn't be
surprised if the storm remained stationary, slowly spinning itself
out near Victoria, Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   The storm dumped up to a foot of rain on some areas near the
coast and caused the kind of tidal flooding many residents hadn't
seen since Hurricane Alicia in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no more beach here,'' Freeport City Manager Ken Maltby
said. ``It's like one ocean out here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Public Safety reported two tornadoes. One, in
the Matagorda County town of Sargent, destroyed a house, slightly
injuring five people. Another, in the Palm Beach area of Galveston,
destroyed a vacant home.
</P>
<P>
   In Louisiana, high winds left one man dead and six people
injured, three of them critically, in Lafourche Parish, where
parish President Aaron Caillouet called a state of emergency.
Moderate to severe damage was reported to 48 homes, two businesses
and 10 vehicles, Sheriff Craig Webre said.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana Gov. Mike Foster and New Orleans Mayor Marc Morial
declared states of emergency amid predictions that 4 to 6 inches
more rain would fall.
</P>
<P>
   The storm's unpredictable nature has vexed forecasters from the
start, Rose said. Instead of rotating around a focused center,
Frances has been ill-defined. In addition, the worst flooding has
occurred in Houston and New Orleans _ hundreds of miles from the
storm center, typically the area of most intense rainfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its been very bizarre,'' Rose said. ``Everything is kind of
different with this storm.''
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, Galveston, Houston, and nearby coastal counties caught
the worst of the storm Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   A series of squall lines battered Galveston Island and flooded
some neighborhoods. Schools and most businesses closed for the day,
and the city told all nonessential workers to stay home.
</P>
<P>
   Galveston's emergency manager, William Zagorski, said some
residents in one flooded area were evacuated with dump trucks and
boats as low-lying homes were swamped. Zagorski said two earlier
storms _ including Charley _ pushed water into the island's back
bays, ``and this other water piled up on top of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Downtown Houston was ringed with a moat of swollen bayous.
</P>
<P>
   The city's schools closed, and three major freeways _ Interstate
45 from the north, Interstate 10 from the west and Texas 288 from
the south_ were shut by high water at the height of the storm
Friday morning and remained closed much of the day, making travel a
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Many motorists just abandoned their cars as rain fell at nearly
an inch an hour. Others ignored police barricades and drove into
flooded low-lying areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people just don't think,'' Houston police officer George
Mixon said after a rain-filled underpass brought one unidentified
driver to a halt, her car totaled as floodwaters poured in.
</P>
<P>
   The flooding was Houston's worst since 1994, when heavy rains
inundated areas north and east of the city. Other parts of coastal
Texas reported wind and heavy rain Friday, but no major flooding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't as bad as we thought it (would be). We were lucky,''
said Calhoun County Sheriff B.B. Brown, whose jurisdiction includes
the gulfside towns of Port Lavaca, Port O'Connor, and Indianola.

<P>
   AUSTIN _ A tough year for Texas Democrats could get tougher, but
the impeachment report on President Clinton might not be a
Republican slam-dunk on the character issue, political strategists
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates will be asked about their sex lives point blank.

<P>
   Strategies will be stalled in the critical beginning days of TV
exposure.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   ``I've got a feeling the next 10 days are going to be
fascinating, but it's going to be ugly,'' said Democratic
consultant Jeff Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any candidate running for Congress or other office who thinks
they're not going to be asked if they had an affair, those people
are fooling themselves. And if they did and they lie about it,
they're going to pay a big price.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican consultant Mark Sanders said Friday's Internet
release of independent counsel Kenneth Starr's stinging report on
Clinton's relationship with intern Monica Lewinsky _ and
allegations of efforts to conceal it _ put a black cloud over
campaigning in Texas. How long it will remain is unclear, Sanders
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a huge distraction, the impact of which is
immeasurable at this moment,'' Sanders said. ``It could freeze the
whole process. It could make it impossible for candidates to get
any kind of message out.''
</P>
<P>
   If Watergate serves as a guide, said Republican strategist
Reggie Bashur, Democrats could suffer what pollsters call vote
``suppression,'' with Democrats staying home on election day, just
as Republicans did in 1974 after President Nixon's resignation.
``It may well be, come November 3, the Democratic turnout is
considerably lower than expected,'' Bashur said.
</P>
<P>
   But the seeds were sewn for Democratic troubles long before
Clinton's acknowledgment, long before the curious and the political
voyeurs threatened to freeze the Internet, said George Christian, a
political consultant and onetime aide to President Lyndon Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even without this, just looking at Texas politics, the Clinton
scandal is almost irrelevant because Democrats started this
election cycle with a pretty weak campaign,'' Christian said.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto, Montgomery said. ``First of all, the Democratic primary
had very low voter turnout. And with the governor's race not being
as competitive this year, you're looking at a lower general
election turnout.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans will want to talk about character as an issue, in
sophisticated ways, he said. ``You see that already in Bush's ads,
talking about what's happening in Washington,'' Montgomery said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the perception of a partisan Starr investigation _
and subsequent impeachment hearings _ puts the Clinton scandal on a
different basis than Watergate, when the American public saw
Democrats and Republicans working together to investigate charges
against President Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   If political hay could be got, then Gov. George W. Bush was not
baling it Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The day's first cup of coffee in hand, Bush walked through the
Governor's Mansion early Friday and insisted it was not a day for
we-told-you-so.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, his father had raised the character thing in 1992 before
Bill Clinton sent him into retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Bush was on board with Bob Dole unsuccessfully tried to
rekindle the issue against Clinton in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, the darkest day of the Clinton administration,
Bush insisted there was nothing to rejoice about in a president who
was caught with his pants down.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no personal satisfaction in what is happening,'' the
governor said. ``First and foremost this is very serious business
and I would say I personally feel no joy. I feel sorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor said the president has left a trail of
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think America was willing to forgive and had hoped for the
best out of everybody,'' said Bush. ``The problem with this issue
is that many Americans who supported the president and hoped that
he would behave are now having their hopes dashed as a result of
this investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Bush was asked if there is anything in his background
that could call his character and integrity into question. ``Not
since I've been the governor of the great state of Texas,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   As he and other Republican statewide candidates toured Texas and
made speeches on the first day of a three-day campaign swing,
Clinton's problems went almost wholly unmentioned _ except when
reporters asked about it. Only attorney general candidate John
Cornyn ventured a reference to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the Democrats are running away from their leader of
their party, I am proud to be running with a great leader for the
Republican Party,'' Cornyn said in Temple.
</P>
<P>
   And Tony Garza, the GOP candidate for a Railroad Commission
seat, told the Abilene rally that ``Texans realize values matter.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison and Phil Gramm, who would sit in
judgment of Clinton if the House approves articles of impeachment,
joined up with the Republican candidates for a rally in Richardson.
Both senators acted like jurors, unwilling to prejudge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a sad day for America,'' Hutchison said. ``No
one wants to take up articles of impeachment. This is not something
we look forward to.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Gramm, ``If I could wish this away I would.''
</P>
<P>
   Some strategists suggested that Jim Mattox, the once-indicted _
and acquitted _ Democratic attorney general candidate may be
vulnerable to a character campaign. Cornyn already has broached it.
</P>
<P>
   But Christian and Montgomery said Mattox, in some ways the
strongest Democratic candidate, can beat it. ``He's probably first
to admit that he has a lot of barnacles,'' Christian said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mattox is different,'' Montgomery said. ``The number of people
who see him as favorable and unfavorable is probably set in
stone.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Mattox _ the lone Democrat leading his Republican
opponent in statewide polls _ said he expected the worst. ``I think
no doubt they're going to conduct a mean, nasty campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, who compared the Starr report to Hustler
magazine, said it is too early to discuss impeachment. But he added
that ``if it was me, I'd resign, and I'd do it because I wouldn't
want to put the country through any more of this difficulty.''

 &HT;    Washington provides students a first hand history lesson
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dayton, Ohio -- The Centerville High School seniors in Teresa
Lonsbury's American Government class were scheduled to learn about
impeachment sometime later in the school year.
</P>
<P>
   But let's just say current events have prompted Lonsbury to,
well, adjust her curriculum a bit.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 students in Lonsbury's first-period, advanced-placement
class circled their desks Friday morning to share their views on
history in the making in Washington D.C. Part of the conversation
focused on the legal intricacies of grand juries and special
prosecutors and impeachment _ but it didn't take long for the
discussion to turn to topics such as adultery and perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Will Staler said he respects what Clinton has been able to
accomplish during his term _ but has no respect for how he has
manipulated people and abused power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disgusting that everyone has let this pass for so long,''
Staler said. ``I don't know what that says to the women of this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Annette Bryan wondered how many other women had experiences with
Clinton similar to Monica Lewinsky's, but noted that it certainly
appeared Lewinsky seemed to have less-than-pure motives for her
actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had to have something in mind if she saved what she
wore,'' Bryan said. ``That's sick!'' Her classmates nodded their
heads in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Feurer said Clinton is no different than any other
adulterer. ``It's wrong because of what he did, but it's not more
wrong just because he's the president,'' Feurer said. Others were
not so sure, arguing that it's appropriate to hold presidents to
higher standards.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan said if Clinton had told the truth about his relationship
with the former White House intern, he would not be facing perjury
charges or impeachment. ``But if we let the president get away with
lying in court, what about everyone else? Will they all think it's
OK?''
</P>
<P>
   The topic of the day clearly touched a nerve among the
12th-graders, who were born six years or so after Richard Nixon
resigned under threat of impeachment. Some comments were greeted by
a flurry of responses, with several students trying to make their
points at once.
</P>
<P>
   But the students said they don't talk about Clintongate much
outside of government class _occasionally at home with their
parents, but not much among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Lonsbury said that's not so surprising, given the demands on and
interests of high school seniors. Besides, for the foreseeable
future, the topic will remain quite active in government class.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to get through the curriculum, because there's just
so much time in the school year,'' Lonsbury said. ``But when things
like this are happening....''

 &HT;    Rushing to read it first
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Web sites big and small were clearing off pages,
creating templates, checking server capacity and making
preparations for receiving the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Silberman, executive editor MSNBC on the Internet
(http://www.msnbc.com) said his Web site was bracing for an
onslaught of users that eventually topped 2 million by the time the
report was posted on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were breaking our own records yet, and the report wasn't
even up yet,'' MSNBC spokeswoman Debbie Wilson said. ``It's very
raw data, but it is an all-time high.'' MSNBC's previous high _
like most of the news sites contacted _ recorded more than 1
million users the day of President Clinton's grand jury testimony.
The company estimates that if usage rates remain as high as they
were early Friday, they would most likely pass the 2 million user
mark before the day's end.
</P>
<P>
   To help lighten the load on the Library of Congress and House of
Representatives Web sites, an arrangement was made to provide an
unedited copy of the report to the Associated Press before it was
posted to the government sites. The AP turned the document around
immediately to a handful of major news organizations including Cox
Interactive Media, a unit of Cox Enterprises, owner of The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, CNN and Knight Ridder. The sites selected by
the AP were chosen for their ability to handle large amounts of
traffic and to process Web data quickly.
</P>
<P>
   CNN posted the report on its site at 2:45 p.m. and claimed
bragging rights to being first news site on the Web to post the
report.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Kerrin Roberts said traffic was hovering around
300,000. Roberts also said the 340,000 hits per minute the CNN
servers were delivering to users ``was a record for us. It was the
highest we've served and probably a record for the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet Service Providers also were busy coping with the stress
of users logging on to read the Starr report. ``The story is the
story,'' said MindSpring spokesman Ed Hansen, who said the
Atlanta-based ISP's servers were stretched to capacity Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Some Atlanta-area users were further hampered by technological
problems. A major pipeline owned by Miss.-based WorldCom was
damaged in an early Friday morning train accident. The fiber optic
pipeline that serves many of metro Atlanta Internet Service
Providers (ISP) was back by early afternoon. WorldCom was uncertain
how many customers were affected. BellSouth Corp. spokesman Bill
McCloskey said its online service Friday was slowed by cut fiber.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Bergman, spokeswoman for ABCNews
(http://www.abcnews.com), said their site is ``exceeding all
previous traffic records.'' The previous high was 1.6 million
visitors for the Clinton testimony.
</P>
<P>
   America Online Inc., the nation's largest online service with 13
million members, saw its traffic shoot up by 30 percent. AOL also
set up message boards, polls and chat rooms. By early evening,
30,000 Americans had participated in AOL chats and more than
130,000 people had registered their opinions about the Clinton
scandal in an AOL poll. (In that poll, 26 percent voted for
impeachment, 31 percent voted for resignation, 35 percent voted to
allow him to continue his term and 6 percent voted for a strict
reprimand.) In the first hour the report was available, more than
62,000 copies were downloaded from the service. ``This is on par
with Clinton's traffic, Princess Diana's death and the O.J.
trial,'' AOL spokeswoman Pam McGraw said.
</P>
<P>
   Another site, AccessAtlanta (http://www.accessatlanta.
</P>
<P>
   com), part of Cox Interactive, also reported record traffic
since it posted the Report on AccessAtlanta and the 20 other Cox
city sites. General Manager George deGolian said that while
specific numbers weren't available as of 4 p.m. Friday,
AccessAtlanta and the other Cox sites were taking in three times
the normal requests for pages that each site would normally get.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, we expect the numbers to get higher as people come
home for the weekend,'' deGolian said. ``People have seen the
document at work but didn't have time to read it. Now they might
want to actually sit down and read it, and that's going to take
some time.''

 &HT;    Internet: Surfers facing a flood of facts
 &HT;    By Mary Beth Regan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the summer of 1974, millions of Americans
watched television as the details of Watergate unfolded in
congressional hearings. Those hearings eventually led to a
disgraced Richard Nixon's resigning as president.
</P>
<P>
   Today, millions of Americans are turning to their computers to
click on the most sordid details of independent counsel Kenneth
Starr's report about President Clinton's involvement with White
House intern Monica Lewinsky. The Starr report could lead to a
House decision on whether grounds exist for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Both events put the public squarely in the middle of a political
debate in a historic manner. And the interactive technology of the
Internet is swifter, with greater permutations than the essentially
passive one-way transmission of television.
</P>
<P>
   As lawmakers grapple with whether to proceed with impeachment
hearings against the president, media and legal scholars are
struggling to make sense of the nation's rapid-fire medium _ the
Web _ and its impact on public policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's danger here,'' warned Mickey Edwards, a former
Oklahoma congressman who is a professor at Harvard University's
John F. Kennedy School of Government. ``It's good for people to be
informed, but it's bad when the public has more information than
they have perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet frenzy began Wednesday, when Speaker Newt Gingrich
(R-Ga.) announced that the House's GOP majority would post the
445-page report on the Internet as soon as the House passed a
resolution to distribute it. Prior to that, the largest Net news
dump tried was Massachusetts Superior Court Judge Hiller B. Zobel's
attempt to post his second-degree murder conviction of British au
pair Louise Woodward last November.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the Clinton team beat Gingrich to the punch
Friday, posting the President's 78-page response on the White House
Web site even before legislative techies could get the Starr
document posted. That response was quickly picked up by the news
media and vetted on national broadcasts while reporters frantically
tried to download the Starr report itself.
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon Friday, the free-for-all was in full swing.
Major commercial sites such as MSNBC.com posted warnings that they
were experiencing heavy traffic. CNN.com reported that its Web page
was getting an estimated 300,000 hits per minute. Even the Drudge
Report, where tipster Matt Drudge first broke the story, posted
messages that it couldn't update.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based Relevant Knowledge Inc. estimated that the
number of U.S. Web surfers was up 175 percent Friday. Traffic to
the federal government's Starr postings, on the Thomas site,
(www.thomas.loc.gov/icrept), was 10 times as heavy as normal
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   That meant the Web was slow. ``All the major sites are
experiencing heavy traffic and they're slowing down,'' said Doug
McFarland, senior vice president and general manager of Media
Metrix in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Some applauded Friday's events at the arrival of the the Web as
a mainstream medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've really come full circle,'' said Omar Wasow, an Internet
analyst with MSNBC.com and president of New York Online. ``The
irony here is that Net was once seen as the gathering place for the
fringe or rumor-mongers. Now it's being embraced by the U.S.
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike during the Watergate scandal, when the public was forced
to rely on the media to interpret events, the Web posting of the
Starr summary gives readers direct access to the information. Some
see that as a step forward for democracy. Steven Brill, the brash
editor of Brill's Content magazine, told Dow Jones, ``It
democratizes information. ... The media won't be able to spin
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, other scholars say dumping the full text of the summary
could lead to public pressure on lawmakers to act quickly or
rashly. ``I fear we're moving toward a push-button democracy,''
said Andrew L. Shapiro, director of the Aspen Institute's Internet
Project. ``We still want to give our elected leaders room to
lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, news junkies across the nation pored over the
independent counsel's report late Friday, snickering at the
intimate details.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad, sad day for America,'' said Thomas Mann, director
of governmental studies at Brookings Institution, a Washington
think tank. ``But I'm afraid we have seen the window of the
future.''

 &HT;    Web site proves elusive for some
 &HT;    By Eric Sundquist
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Starr report, first made available on the Internet Friday,
made for the biggest test to date of the Net as a mass medium. The
Net passed, sort of.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a huge spike in use, it didn't crash. And it did have
the entire contents of the huge report, almost instantly. But not
everyone who wanted to get on, could. And lots of people were put
off with the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth sent an e-mail to employees warning them against
tapping into the Starr report. The message warned that mass
attempts to access Starr sites could cause congestion and reminded
employees of the company policy against non-business use of the
Net. The message warned that supervisors could monitor employees'
use of computers and take action ``up to and including dismissal''
of offending workers. Net users around metro Atlanta had various
degrees of success when they tried to get the report, and varying
degrees of interest in trying.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Register, 35, of Vinings was one of the cyberthwarted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not loading, so either they've not posted it yet, or the
cite is too jammed,'' said Register, trying several Internet home
pages _ CNN, Mindspring, ABC News _ with no luck.
</P>
<P>
   About three hours a week, Register said, she logs on when her
13-month-old son, Walker, is napping.
</P>
<P>
   She spent a hapless hour trying to read the posting, finally
giving up at 3:30.
</P>
<P>
   In Cobb County, at the superior court building, former Georgia
Supreme Court Justice E. Conley Ingram tried to access the report
on his laptop computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to get on Mindspring.com to see if I can pull it
up,'' said Ingram, ``although I have a lot of ambivalence about it,
because I'm afraid I'm going to be sick to my stomach about what
I'm going to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Ingram got onto the site, but the report wasn't posted yet. So
the judge, who pays for Internet access by the hour, disconnected
and said he'd try again later.
</P>
<P>
   In his office off Marietta Square, lawyer Matt Flournoy had
better luck. He tried to pull up the report on the ABC web site, to
no avail. But when he tried CNN, he got in immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God,'' said Flournoy, scrolling through the report,
clicking on ``Names'' and viewing a list of people involved in the
investigation. ``You'd better hope your name isn't on this list.''

DODGERS NAME MALONE THEIR GENERAL MANAGER
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three years after walking away from his job in Montreal saying
he wanted to build a team, not tear it apart, Kevin Malone on
Friday became the general manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers, a
team with lush resources.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, who has been the assistant general manager of the
Baltimore Orioles for the past three seasons, gained the Los
Angeles job over Jim Bowden, the Cincinnati Reds' general manager,
and Bob Watson, the New York Yankees' former general manager. Dave
Dombrowski had been viewed as the No. 1 choice, but he accepted a
five-year contract extension worth more than $1 million a year to
remain with the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Minaya, the New York Mets' assistant general manager, was
among those who had been interviewed for the Dodgers' job.
According to one news report last month, the Dodgers were
interested in Bobby Valentine, the Mets' manager, for the general
manager's job. But Valentine was not considered for the job despite
his relationship with Tommy Lasorda, the Dodgers' former manager,
who became interim general manager when Fred Claire was fired in
June.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine, even though he has two years remaining on his
contract with the Mets, also has been mentioned as a possible
candidate for the Dodgers' managing job. However, Lasorda's input
for that job will be less influential than if he had remained
interim general manager. He was named senior vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, 41, had been considered the most likely to succeed Pat
Gillick as the Orioles' general manager. Gillick is expected to
step down at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Malone became the Expos' general manager after Dan Duquette left
for Boston in January 1994. But the Expos kept shedding their good
young players rather than signing them to expensive contracts, and
after two frustrating seasons, Malone resigned in October 1995. The
Expos at the time had the major leagues' lowest payroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in the building business, not in the dismantling
business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Malone is only the sixth general manager in the Dodgers'
history. When Claire was fired, he was in his 12th season as
general manager and had the longest continuous tenure of any
general manager. Bill Russell was fired as manager at the same time
and was replaced on an interim basis by Glenn Hoffman, who is not
expected to remain in the job. The Dodgers are in third place in
the National League West and far out of the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   The upheaval was not surprising, given that Rupert Murdoch's Fox
organization bought the team for $311 million in March.

 By JILL ABRAMSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ She called him ``Big Guy'' and smuggled presents
and notes to him in the Oval Office. He told her that she made him
feel young and that he loved her energy and smile.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship that Monica Lewinsky described to the grand
jury convened by the Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth Starr,
began with furtive Oval Office kisses and sexual encounters but
deepened into something that, at least to her, was deeply
emotional. ``I never expected to fall in love with the president,''
she testified, ``I was surprised that I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has told prosecutors a different story. He said a
relationship that began as a friendship became inappropriately
intimate. ``I never should have started it,'' he testified. He said
he was deeply torn about their dealings, to the point that in
describing one of their encounters, he said he ``was sick after it
was over.''
</P>
<P>
   But even after a long narrative that depicts their relationship
in graphic detail, Starr's report to the House sheds little light
on the central mystery at the heart of the sex and perjury
investigation that has engulfed Clinton for the last eight months:
Why would the most powerful man in the world risk such a dangerous
liaison _ under the noses of Secret Service agents and staff
members _with a 21-year-old woman wearing the pink pass of a White
House intern around her neck?
</P>
<P>
   Often in her own words and with amazingly detailed recollections
for dates and atmospherics, Ms. Lewinsky emerges from these pages
as being aggressive, needy, besotted and demanding to the point of
becoming extortionate.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Ms. Lewinsky initiated the relationship in the fall
of 1995, she said, during the shutdown of the federal government,
with ``intense flirting.'' She lifted her jacket to give him a
glimpse of her thong underwear. Within minutes they were kissing in
an area near the Oval Office, she testified, and she swiftly began
performing oral sex on him.
</P>
<P>
   By their third sexual rendezvous, she worried that he did not
remember her name. ``Is this just about sex?'' she asked him, ``or
do you have some interest in trying to get to know me as a
person?'' The president laughed, Ms. Lewinsky told investigators,
and said that ``he cherishes the time'' with her.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she left that day, he ``recited both my home number
and my office number off the top of his head.''
</P>
<P>
   On another day, Ms. Lewinsky said, he suddenly kissed her.
``This was another one of those occasions when I was babbling on
about something, and he just kissed me, kind of to shut me up, I
think,'' she testified.
</P>
<P>
   But still, it was not until they had had some form of sex for
the sixth time, and she was counting, that the two of the them had
their first ``lengthy and personal conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Her insecurities in those early days were seemingly offset by
the calculating way in which she would later play the president's
affection to her advantage, according to her testimony. Long after
their brief interludes began, she wrote the president a letter
threatening to disclose their relationship and pressed him hard for
help getting a job.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton emerges from the report in equally contradictory ways.
Ms. Lewinsky sensed early on that he felt it was wrong to be
involved with an intern. He broke off the relationship twice, only
to resume sexual relations with her. Until 1997, toward the end of
the relationship, he did not let her bring him to climax, telling
her, at one point, that he did not trust her enough. And, after
another encounter in which Ms. Lewinsky said the president soiled
her dress, he said he felt sick.
</P>
<P>
   The descriptions given by Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky of their
relationship conflict in important ways. Ms. Lewinsky said it began
in November 1995 while she was an intern and included 10 sexual
encounters, 8 of which occurred while she was working at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his testimony and in a 73-page rebuttal to Starr's
report released by the White House Friday, said the relationship
began later and was less extensive. The rebuttal emphasized that it
was Clinton who broke off their sporadic encounters in early 1997
``because he knew they were wrong.'' Another supporter of the
president, the Rev. J. Philip Wogaman, his pastor at Foundry United
Methodist Church in Washington, has also said that the president
broke off the relationship and began privately seeking forgiveness
before it became public last January.
</P>
<P>
   The portrait of the relationship in Starr's report is based
mostly on Ms. Lewinsky's grand jury testimony, given under a grant
of immunity from prosecution. It is also based on the testimony and
tapes of Linda R. Tripp, Ms. Lewinsky's former best friend, in whom
Ms. Lewinsky confided many details about her encounters with the
president. Several friends of Ms. Lewinsky's and members of her
family testified before the grand jury, and their accounts of
conversations with her about the president also are excerpted in
the report.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky confided in 11 people, including a therapist, about
her sexual encounters with the president ``as they occurred,'' the
report said. She also put together an 11-page chart for Starr's
team of prosecutors listing each encounter and phone call from
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship is also traced to other evidence, such as Ms.
Lewinsky's now infamous Gap dress which the report said is stained
with DNA material that matches the president, and with phone logs
that confirm some of Ms. Lewinsky's recollections.
</P>
<P>
   She and the president contradict each other over the degree of
intimacy they expressed toward each other, too. He did touch her
breasts and genitalia, she testified. Clinton steadfastly has
denied touching her; Starr's report insists that the president's
denials amount to lying under oath in the Paula Jones case.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky testified that her physical relationship with the
president included oral sex but not sexual intercourse. According
to Ms. Lewinsky, she performed oral sex on the president; he never
performed oral sex on her.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Ms. Lewinsky grew emotionally attached to Clinton. At
times, she believed that he loved her too. They were physically
affectionate: ``A lot of hugging, holding hands sometimes,'' she
testified. ``He always used to push the hair out of my face.'' She
called him ``Handsome.'' On occasion, he called her ``Sweetie,''
``Baby,'' or sometimes ``Dear.'' He told her that he enjoyed
talking to her _ she recalled his saying that the two of them were
``emotive and full of fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, their relationship remained oddly constrained,
frustrating Ms. Lewinsky after both she and the president had
stimulated each other to sexual climax. She wanted to have sexual
intercourse with him and sent him a note telling him so after
seeing the the movie, ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky felt demeaned by some of their encounters, she
testified. Several times, the president talked on the phone to
Congressmen and others while she performed oral sex on him. the
telephone with Congressmen. During one of those calls, she said,
the president exposed himself to signal to her that he wanted sex.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the president seemed reluctant to reach a climax while
she was performing oral sex, sometimes pushing her away. On the day
that he stained her dress with his semen, he had interrupted her
and tried to stop her, Ms. Lewinsky testified that the president
hugged her and said ``he didn't want to get addicted to me, and he
didn't want me to get addicted to him.``
</P>
<P>
   In these descriptions, the relationship between the president
and Ms. Lewinsky seems to veer away from affectionate sexual romps
to the border of strangeness, including an incident where the
president used a cigar as a sexual aid.
</P>
<P>
   The report says the couple had 50 phone calls, and that on 10 to
15 occasions, they had phone sex. After one of the phone-sex
encounters, the president fell asleep during the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   The report describes the myriad ways the president and Ms.
Lewinsky tried to hide their relationship, by concocting ``cover
stories'' for her frequent visits to the Oval Office, and by having
their sexual encounters in the windowless hallway outside the
study. Ms. Lewinsky often pretended she was taking papers into the
Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   She testified that he suggested a cover story if their phone
conversations were intercepted. During one of their last encounters
in 1997, Ms. Lewinsky said the president told her ``that he
suspected a foreign embassy (he did not specify which one) was
tapping his telephones, and he proposed cover stories,'' the report
says Ms. Lewinsky testified. ``If ever questioned, she should say
that the two of them were just friends,'' the report continues.
``If anyone ever asked about their phone sex, she should say that
she knew their calls were being monitored all along, and the phone
sex was just a put-on.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last months of their relationship, in 1997, Ms. Lewinsky
grew frustrated, desperate and angry. The report says that Secret
Service officers and agents testified that they saw Ms. Lewinsky
and the president alone in the Oval Office on several occasions.
One officer complained to Evelyn Lieberman, the Deputy Chief of
Staff for Operations about her being a nuisance. Ms. Lieberman
chided Ms. Lewinsky her being in the West Wing, and later testified
that she considered Ms. Lewinsky ``a clutch,'' that is, a person
who was ``always someplace she shouldn't be.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, White House officials arranged for Ms. Lewinsky
to get another job in the Administration, the report says. Upon
hearing of her dismissal, Ms. Lewinsky ``burst into tears,'' the
report says, and asked to stay in the White House. ``She felt that
she was being transferred simply because of her relationship with
the president,'' the report says. ``I was never going to see the
president again,'' she said, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   But on April 7, 1996, Easter Sunday, a week after the death of
Ron Brown, the secretary of commerce, the president called Ms.
Lewinsky at home and they arranged for her to come to the White
House later that day.
</P>
<P>
   When she visited him, the president promised to bring Ms.
Lewinsky back to the White House if he won re-election that
November, the report says. They had sex following that
conversation, during which Clinton talked to his consultant, Dick
Morris, by phone.
</P>
<P>
   They were also interrupted by Harold Ickes, the deputy chief of
staff, who shouted `` president' from outside the office, Ms.
Lewinsky testified. She was able to scurry away through the dining
room door.
</P>
<P>
   After she had been banished from the White House, the president
told Ms. Lewinsky that he wished he had more time for her, Ms.
Lewinsky told prosecutors. This fanned her fantasies that they
would one day be together. ``And he said, well, I don't know, I
might be alone in three years, And then I said something about...us
sort of being together...
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky also became jealous. She quizzed the president
after she learned of a press inquiry about the president's
relationship with former White House volunteer Kathleen Willey.
``The president responded that the harassment allegation was
ludicrous, because he would never approach a small breasted
woman,'' Ms. Lewinsky told prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   On May 24, 1997, the president broke off the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky wept. She told prosecutors that the president told
her that he had had hundreds of affairs but since turning 40, he
had tried to be faithful to his wife. Most of his encounters with
Ms. Lewinsky took place when Hillary Rodham Clinton was out of
town, or on foreign travel.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Lewinsky, who was working at the Pentagon, pressed to
see the president. Through Betty Currie, she arranged to bring him
a birthday gift on August 16. She tried to perform oral sex on him,
but the president rebuffed her. Ms. Lewinsky said he told her,
``I'm trying not to do this and I'm trying to be good.''There were
no more sexual encounters.
</P>
<P>
   With the Jones case causing new problems, Ms. Lewinsky made
plans to find a job in New York, and began pressuring the president
for help. At this point, the president grew angry and worried about
the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Sid Blumenthal, a White House communications adviser who was
summoned before Starr's grand jury said the president had told him
that Ms. Lewinsky had ``threatened him. She said that she would
tell people they'd had an affair, that she was known as the stalker
among her peers, and that she hated it and if she had an affair or
said she had an affair then she wouldn't be a stalker any more.''

 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With tears in his eyes, President Clinton on Friday
morning told a roomful of clergy that he had sinned. He spoke just
hours before the world was presented with a painstaking account by
prosecutors of when, where, and how.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing an annual prayer breakfast at the White House,
Clinton drew on the New Testament, the Yom Kippur liturgy and
Ernest Hemingway as he made his most abject confession yet of
personal failure, while declaring that he would defend and redeem
his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is a fancy way to say that I have
sinned,'' he admitted softly, saying that after resisting
expressions of contrition he had reached ``the rock-bottom truth of
where I am.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Clinton also asked for forgiveness from
Monica Lewinsky, on the day that the details of their intimate
relationship _ details that he had denied and struggled to suppress
_ poured out through the Internet, whose wonders as a tool of
communication he has so often extolled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to me,'' the president told the prayer
meeting, ``that everybody who has been hurt know that the sorrow I
feel is genuine: first, and most important, my family; also my
friends, my staff, my Cabinet; Monica Lewinsky and her family, and
the American people. I have asked all for their forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 10-minute remarks, Clinton tried to walk a line between
abject contrition and the fierce determination to fight that he has
expressed privately to friends. ``I will instruct my lawyers to
mount a vigorous defense, using all available appropriate legal
arguments,'' he said, ``but legal language must not obscure the
fact that I have done wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Clinton's lawyers later issued a 73-page defense before
they had read the report by Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater
independent counsel. Starr and Congress had rebuffed White House
requests for an advance look at the report.
</P>
<P>
   In the company of clerics and to refrains of Scripture, the
president spent a solemn morning in public with his wife, Hillary.
He spoke at the annual prayer breakfast first, and then went to the
National Cathedral at midday to address a memorial service for the
victims of the twin bombings at U.S. embassies in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In a more raucous setting early Friday evening, on the South
Lawn of the White House, Clinton received an award for his work on
the Ulster peace accord from a group of Irish-Americans. As speaker
after speaker lauded the president's work for peace, the crowd rose
repeatedly in whooping ovations. Seated side by side on stage, the
Clintons laughed and waved, and leaned often toward each other to
whisper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary and I have been over there just lapping this up,''
Clinton said when he finally stood to speak after almost an hour.
``We don't want this to ever end.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a fundamentally normal presidential schedule, on one of
the strangest days in the history of the presidency. The Clintons,
two fierce political fighters, had finally and utterly lost perhaps
their most bitterly fought battle, to maintain what Mrs. Clinton
has often called a ``zone of privacy'' for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an unusual, and I think unusually important, day
today,'' the president said in his remarks at the prayer breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton bit his lower lip repeatedly during his remarks, in his
trademark gesture of powerful emotion. He spoke quietly and
haltingly, much as he did in apologizing to Democratic donors in
Orlando, Fla., on Thursday _ and in stark contrast to the defiant,
even angry tone of his brief talk to the nation on Aug. 17, when he
first acknowledged an intimate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The president expressed gratitude to those who thought ``the
bounds of privacy have been excessively and unwisely invaded,'' but
added that in this case the invasion ``may be a blessing, because I
still sinned. And if my repentance is genuine and sustained and if
I can maintain both a broken spirit and a strong heart, then good
can come of this for our country as well as for me and my family.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his experience could teach children that ``integrity is
important and selfishness is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not always seem grim in public on Friday. At the
memorial service, he turned around in his straight-backed chair to
exchange a laugh with Donna Shalala, the secretary of health and
human services.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting Clinton called to apologize to his Cabinet on
Thursday, Shalala challenged an argument he made that presidents
should be judged by their policies in public, not their behavior in
private. ``Mr. President, surely you don't believe that,'' she
said, according to a person familiar with the exchange. Clinton did
not back down an inch, this person said.
</P>
<P>
   While his lawyers were distributing their defense of the
president, he was at a memorial service for the 12 Americans who
died in the embassy bombings on Aug. 7. Clinton recalled the public
and private aspects of their lives as he spoke from the limestone
lectern in the vast, echoing National Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two sides of their lives _ who they were in their labors,
and who they were as husbands and wives, sons and daughters,
friends and colleagues, came together,'' he said. ``For as they
showed every day in their devotion to family and friends, their
work was about bringing better lives to all.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was the breakfast speech that was the centerpiece of
Clinton's day, and he told his aides that he was up until 4 a.m.
working, scribbling it on three small sheets of paper. Despite a
request by one senior aide, the president refused to show his staff
his remarks before delivering them.
</P>
<P>
   In those remarks, the president said that God could ``make us
strong at the broken places,'' a thought drawn from Hemingway's ``A
Farewell to Arms.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that while he must always keep his failure ``as a
caution light in my life,'' the country itself must ``move
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Clerics who attended the breakfast said they had been impressed
and moved by Clinton's words of contrition, in language that drew
on both Christian and Jewish traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was repentant this morning,'' said the Rev. Joan
Brown Campbell, general secretary of the National Council of
Churches. ``And for me, that's more important than being sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the question for our nation is: Are we prepared to be
led by a repentant sinner?'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Paul Menitoff, executive vice president of the Central
Conference of American Rabbis, which represents leaders in
Judaism's Reform movement, said he was impressed that Clinton's
remarks followed the basic steps required for repentance on Yom
Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement _ a candid admission of
wrongdoing, an apology to those who were wronged, a plea for
forgiveness and a pledge to avoid such behavior in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so much in line with Jewish tradition and the season of
Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur that we're heading into,'' Menitoff
said. ``It certainly added in my eyes to his credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Other clergy, however, voiced a more mixed response. The Rev.
John Buehrens, president of the Unitarian-Universalist Association,
said Clinton's remarks were ``a very sincere and heartfelt
confession.'' But Buehrens said he still felt deeply concerned
about ``the misuse of power'' evident in Clinton's having had a
relationship ``with a very young subordinate.''
</P>
<P>
   Some also offered praise for Hillary Clinton's conduct in the
face of the scandal. Ms. Campbell said she told the first lady she
had been ``wonderfully strong.'' Mrs. Clinton, she said, replied,
```Not always.'''

BRIDGE REPAIRS TO DISRUPT SUBWAY SERVICE NEXT YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MONTE WILLIAMS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The structural problems that have plagued the
Williamsburg Bridge over the years will again inconvenience
commuters starting in May, when city transportation officials are
to suspend subway service across the bridge for roughly five months
for a $150 million repair project.
</P>
<P>
   Brooklyn-bound service on the J, M and Z lines is to terminate
at the Delancey Street station on the Lower East Side, and
Manhattan-bound service will stop at Marcy Avenue in Williamsburg,
Brooklyn. About 90,000 New Yorkers ride the lines each day,
according to the Straphangers Campaign, a rider's advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was first reported Friday in Newsday. Transit officials
said they were planning a campaign to notify the public about the
service suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to talk about something
that's happening eight months from now,'' said Albert O'Leary, a
spokesman for New York City Transit. ``We can't tell you what our
service plan is. We have a whole organization of people who are
working on a service plan and we'll be working on a very aggressive
public-information campaign to let people know how they can still
travel around the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Transportation Department officials said the plan to suspend
subway service is part of a $700 million, long-term repair project
that started a decade ago, when engineers first expressed concerns
about the bridge's structural integrity. The bridge was closed for
two months in 1988 and emergency repairs were made.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, other repairs have been made on the 98-year-old
bridge, frustrating both motorists and subway riders. In July 1996,
city officials closed the bridge's four Brooklyn-bound traffic
lanes for a two-year overhaul, snarling traffic throughout the
Lower East Side.
</P>
<P>
   Repairs to the bridge's south roadway were completed in June,
said Connie Crawford, chief engineer in the city's Department of
Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The bridge was also the site of an accident in June 1995 in
which the motorman of a Manhattan-bound J train was killed and 54
passengers were injured when the J train smashed into an M train.
That accident, which was not related to the structural condition of
the bridge, led to widespread changes in subway speed limits and
safety procedures.
</P>
<P>
   When next year's repairs begin, some riders from Queens may have
the option of transferring to the L or E lines, said Andrew Albert,
chairman of the New York City Transit Riders Council, a transit
advocacy group appointed by the governor.
</P>
<P>
   But riders from the Williamsburg, Bedford-Stuyvesant and
Bushwick sections of Brooklyn could be severely affected, he
warned.
</P>
<P>
   Albert called on the city to construct a bypass track for the J,
M and Z lines, which he said would cost about $23 million. ``That's
not a lot of money when you consider the entire cost of renovating
the Williamsburg Bridge,'' he said. ``There are an awful lot of
people who are going to be inconvenienced. This is going to add an
hour to some people's commutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the commuters from Brooklyn, Albert added, ``Maybe
the people inconvenienced are not influential enough for the city
to construct the bypass track.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to imagine this happening in other places,''
Albert said.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Sept. 13, will move Saturday in the `a' category. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-CLINTON-REVIEW _ Kenneth W. Starr's report became
public so suddenly last week that Americans are still digesting its
charges and tawdriness and weighing their significance. But already
potentially seismic attitudes are taking shape. The politicians,
strategists and scholars trying to gauge them are certain of little
except that much is at stake, regardless of whether Bill Clinton
survives as president. By David E. Rosenbaum. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GLOBAL-MARKETS-REVIEW _ As more of the world's markets come
unhinged _ last week the contagion hit Brazil full force, and many
now worry that the rest of Latin America could succumb as well _
there is a modest revolt under way against one of the biggest
trends of the 1980s and 1990s, the view that money should move
unimpeded around the world, to the places where it can be used most
efficiently. By David E. Sanger. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TEEN-VOLUNTEERS-REVIEW _ Nowadays, volunteerism is the most
popular prescription for improving young people and it has the
added virtue of saving the world. But since this is America,
there's a group or two somewhere voluntarily opposed to it. To
instill a sense of civic duty in teen-agers, the Chicago public
school system has enacted a policy requiring its students to
perform 40 hours of public service to earn a high school diploma.
By Dirk Johnson. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   STARR-CLINTON-REVIEW _ Historians will, no doubt, analyze the
blood feud nearing its denouemont between Bill Clinton and Kenneth
W. Starr in lots of ways _ as a showdown over politics and law, of
constitutional issues and human ones. But a look at where both men
came from suggests another possible prism _ a battle of dueling
Southerners, each of them summing up the competing instincts of the
South in which issues of politics, morals and religion have become
personalized at a deep, visceral level. By Peter Applebome. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   U.N.-ASSEMBLY-REVIEW _ When the annual limousine-and-sirens
season opens at the United Nations on Sept. 21 with high-level
speeches in the General Assembly, a lot of the world's bad boys
won't be anywhere near the podium. They always stay home. By
Barbara Crossette. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TEACHERS-REVIEW _ How do you measure the talent to teach? And
how do you turn knowledgeable people into talented educators? Is an
exam like the one in Massachusetts a tool to raise standards or
does it represent the long, stultifying reach of an educational
bureaucracy? As states raise academic standards for students, New
York and others are moving to stiffen their credentialing
requirements to make sure that teachers can teach more rigorous
curriculum. By Randal C. Archibold. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BASEBALL-HEROES-REVIEW _ Although baseball's charming 129-year
history is a unique asset that distinguishes it from younger
sports, it has also become an undertow from which the sport has
struggled to escape. Today's sports fans aren't preoccupied with
history; they focus on the next this, the next that. Figures from
the past often get mistaken as curiosities rather than as cherished
legends. By Alan Schwarz. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-VOTE-REVIEW _ Germany's most important election in
decades will take place two weeks from Sunday and the striking
thing is this: Whoever wins will inherit a land where the pace has
already been set for them, not so much by politicians as by the
barons of big business. Almost nine years after the fall of the
Berlin Wall, that is not entirely a surprise: As in the United
States or Britain, ideology has lost its primacy, yielding to a
contest among rival politicians to define and capture the
post-ideological center. By Alan Cowell. &QL;

RICHARD MAASS, 79, FOUNDER OF CONFERENCE ON SOVIET JEWRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NADINE BROZAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Maass, a self-employed investments manager whose concern
for the deprived and the victims of discrimination led him to
become the founding chairman of the National Conference on Soviet
Jewry and president of the American Jewish Committee, died Sept. 10
at his home in Purchase, N.Y. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said his son R. Andrew Maass.
</P>
<P>
   As the first chief executive of the National Conference on
Soviet Jewry, he helped lead the group's international campaign
during the cold war of the 1970s, pressuring the Soviet Union's
Communist leaders to ease barriers to emigration by Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played a major role in the campaign, whose slogan was `Let
Them Live or Let Them Leave,''' said Jerry Goodman, a colleague at
the American Jewish Committee, who became the founding executive
director of the National Conference on Soviet Jewry and is now the
executive director of the National Committee for Labor Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he provided was equanimity and balance at a time when
there were so many differences within the organization, and he was
able to reconcile them all,'' Goodman said. ``We had to go through
a lot of contentious issues, including the passage of the
Jackson-Vanik amendment that linked trade benefits to free
immigration.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1968 to 1971, the year the conference was organized, the
total emigration of Jews from the Soviet Union was 17,000, Goodman
said. In 1972, it jumped to 32,000, and for the rest of the 1970s
and 1980s, the number fluctuated depending on political factors. It
reached a peak of 213,000 in 1990, the result of public
demonstrations by groups like the conference and government
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, Maass also served as president of the
Westchester Urban League from 1953 to 1958 and as chairman of the
Purchase College Council, the college's board of trustees, from
1992 until his death.
</P>
<P>
   He was the founder, president and a teacher in an alternative
school for troubled youths called Edu-Cage in the late 1960s and
1970s. It operated out of a burned-out bowling alley in downtown
White Plains and educated students from 35 school districts,
granting diplomas to the graduates from their home schools. Maass,
who took several of the students into his own home, taught there
every morning for 13 years as volunteer. ``He was not a lawyer, but
he taught them street law, teaching them what their rights were,''
said his wife, Dolly Lederer Maass.
</P>
<P>
   None of the school's teachers were certified, she recalled, and
the students were allowed to smoke and to put their feet on their
desks. ``The school operated with only three rules: no drugs, no
fighting and mandatory attendance,'' she said. The school no longer
exists.
</P>
<P>
   In his personal life, as reflected by the license plate on his
car, ``Amhist,'' he was an avid collector of colonial and
Revolutionary War-era historical items in Westchester County and he
donated some of them to the Elmer Holmes Bobst Library at New York
University and the University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Maass donated notes for a speech on emancipation
written by Abraham Lincoln to Purchase College. It fetched $500,000
at auction.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Baltimore, he graduated from the New York University
School of Commerce in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife of 55 years and his son R. Andrew, of
Jackson, Miss., he is survived by another son, Douglas O. Maass of
Sleepy Hollow, N.Y.; a brother, Arthur Aaron Maass of Boston; four
grandchildren, and a great-grandchild.

 Alliance To Limit ATM Fees Faltering   By Peter Sinton  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
The ``No Surcharge Alliance,'' which was supposedly a consumer's
best friend against bank ATM surcharges, may be on the verge of
collapse with the departure of its three biggest members.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Union Bank of California is the latest to drop out, following
Coast Federal and Glendale Federal.
</P>
<P>
   Only 18 months ago, with great fanfare, Union Bank spearheaded
the alliance to give consumers a break from the fees banks charge
noncustomers who use their automated teller machines.
</P>
<P>
   It was designed to help smaller banks, thrifts and credit unions
compete against big banks with huge ATM networks.
</P>
<P>
   On August 30, Union Bank of California quietly began charging
noncustomers $1.50 each time they use its 370 ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, two other founding members _ Glendale and
Coast _ began imposing surcharges. Bay View Bank is considering
imposing the extra fees within 30 days and Sumitomo Bank of
California also is re-evaluating surcharges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big bank greed for ATM fees is killing consumer choice in
California,'' said Jon Golinger, consumer program director for
California Public Interest Research Group. ``With the death of the
No Surcharge Alliance, the overwhelming majority of ATMs in
California now charge consumers twice to use the ATM once.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost all banks, including those in the alliance, have long
charged their own customers a fee _ typically $1 _ to use another
bank's ATM machine.
</P>
<P>
   After April 1996, many also began charging the surcharge on
non-customers who use their ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey in April by CalPIRG, 77 percent of
California ATMS were charging both types of fees.
</P>
<P>
   Golinger believes that banks are entitled to recover the costs
of providing ATM service. But he and other critics charge that the
second fee is ``pure gravy.'' They also contend that big banks use
the surcharge as a weapon to prod customers of small banks and
credit unions to switch their accounts to big institutions with
large ATM networks.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups are not the only ones upset by Union Bank of
California's flip-flop. ``It's galling that the founding member of
the alliance switched its stance,'' said Sanwa Bank California
spokesman Keith Karpe. Sanwa, which has 107 ATMs in California and
was an original member of the No Surcharge Alliance, has no plans
to pull out.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Despite the departure of several large institutions and about
20 smaller ones, the alliance still has 452 mostly small members
with a total of 2,676 ATMs, according to Co-op Network, which
processes ATM transactions for credit unions.
</P>
<P>
   That is down from nearly 3,000 ATMs at its peak, but Co-op
network Senior Vice President Irene Whitcomb insists it is ``still
significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Union Bank of California Vice President Jeff Morrow said his
bank launched the alliance 18 months ago as an experiment ``to test
the viability of a no surcharge stance.'' The departure of other
big members of the alliance and the ``unmistakable trend in the
industry toward surcharging'' persuaded Union Bank of California to
change course.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that banks that have been surcharging have more
money to expand their market share by installing more ATMs at
grocery stores and other nonbank locations. They also have more
money to pay the rising rents at these sites.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, those who do not impose surcharges have less money to
expand their networks and have generally found that their more
virtuous stance has not generated much new business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in the alliance but with the departure of some of
the biggest banks, we've got to re-evaluate its viability going
forward,'' said Sumitomo spokesman Kyle Tatsumoto.
</P>
<P>
   Golinger of CalPIRG is calling for California policymakers to
ban ATM surcharges. Such bills in 27 other states and Congress have
not gotten very far. Big banks have argued that consumers have
plenty of choices and no one is being forced to use another bank's
ATMs.

2 JETS ROOKIES GET A SHOT ON SPECIAL TEAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Suddenly faced with what he admitted was ``a
sense of urgency'' approaching Sunday's game against the Baltimore
Ravens, New York Jets coach Bill Parcells will activate two rookies
to try to jump-start his special teams.
</P>
<P>
   In the Jets' return to respectability last year, the special
teams were the pivotal unit _ not only in producing points, but
also in pinning back the opposition. Thus, Scott Frost, the club's
most noted rookie, who has had a trying time converting from
quarterback to safety, and Blake Spence, a tight end, will play
against Baltimore as the Jets try to avoid falling to 0-2. Both
were kept out of uniform in the season-opening loss last Sunday at
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, in the only exhibition game Parcells has lost in two
seasons with the Jets, the Ravens' Jermaine Lewis produced a
97-yard punt return to open the scoring. It set the tone for a 33-0
trouncing.
</P>
<P>
   In that game, Spence made a critical error on the Lewis runback
by leaving his coverage lane. Lewis found the opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Parcells drilled it into my head afterwards,'' Spence
said. ``There was an invisible line on the field. He said, `Do you
know where the Mississippi River is?' I replied, `Mississippi,
Coach?' I don't think he liked that. But he said, `Don't cross the
line.'''
</P>
<P>
   Spence, who played for Oregon and grew up in Southern
California, admitted he was disappointed in San Francisco because
``it would have been my first game, in my home state, and I had a
lot of family there.'' He did get to see his family even though the
Jets decided on Sunday not to suit him up.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he expects to show his gratitude, he said, by staying in
his lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``This week I'm on the left side, and I have to keep Lewis in
the middle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Frost, there was an almost audible sigh of relief in finally
getting a chance to play. Frost is accustomed to being in the
middle of things: he was the quarterback for Nebraska, last year's
co-national champion. But three years before that, he was a safety
for Stanford. Thus, Frost knows something about defensive
sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure there's a different mentality on defense,'' he said.
``But people ask, `Is there a different toughness?' On offense you
can be tough by taking hit after hit after hit. But on defense
you've got to be aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Frost was the second player the Jets chose in this year's draft,
taken in the third round. He has tried, he said, ``to take in the
big picture'' to accept being on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of expected it,'' he said. ``But in the big scope of
things, I knew I had to develop. It wasn't hard to live with,
knowing what I had to overcome. I had a big disadvantage in camp.
Everyone else was competing for a job. But I was trying to learn a
new position.''
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, the Meadowlands (as the Jets refer to Giants
Stadium) might as well have been Lambeau Field for all the success
the Jets had there. But with routine crowds of more than 70,000
welcoming back to respectability last year's Jets, winning at home
came with a 5-3 mark. The Jets had begun last season with the
league's worst home record of the 1990s.

 Satellites stumbling _ Recent failures point out troubles
dogging  industry   By Dan Fost   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
When a rocket carrying 12 Globalstar satellites shattered in the
Russian tundra three days ago, it underscored the difficulty of
launching and maintaining these fragile metal contraptions.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Worldwide, people are becoming more dependent on satellites for
pagers, mobile phones, television, military security and more. Yet
despite the hundreds of millions of dollars spent and the
industry's booming success, satellites remain a tenuous
proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Satellites have failed both on launch _ three times in the past
month, including the Globalstar debacle _ and in orbit, most
notably when PanAmSat's Galaxy IV cut off 40 million pagers in May.
</P>
<P>
   If the recent parade of troubles is not enough, the biggest
meteor shower in more than 30 years is likely to pelt the Earth's
atmosphere &UR;  &LR; in November or next year, potentially wreaking havoc on
satellites.
</P>
<P>
   The Leonid Meteor Shower could knock out pagers and computer
service right in the middle of Comdex, a trade show that brings
more than 200,000 computer nerds to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   And the computer industry thought it had a Year 2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The satellite industry is keeping their mouths shut'' about
this, said Larry Van Horn, who was managing editor of the
now-defunct Satellite Times. ``They don't want anybody to panic.''
</P>
<P>
   The Leonids light up Earth's night sky every November, but only
every 32 or 33 years are they numerous enough to dazzle sky
watchers. The last time the Leonids came in force was 1966, before
scores of satellites had been launched.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how severe the Leonids will be, or even if this
will be the year for a major meteor storm.
</P>
<P>
   William Ailor of the Aerospace Corp., a Southern California
nonprofit group, testified before Congress this year that the
satellites will be ``sandblasted'' by the Leonids on November 17,
``the largest such threat ever experienced by our critical orbiting
satellite constellations.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ailor said the effects should be minimal, and the industry
holds tight to the hope that chances of a meteor striking a
satellite are remote. ``I don't really ... expect any detrimental
effects caused by these meteor showers,'' said Globalstar Executive
Vice President Anthony Navarra.
</P>
<P>
   Although some satellite components are shielded from space dust,
nothing can protect satellites from a meteor hurtling through space
_ not even a strike force led by Bruce Willis.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Even without a direct hit, satellites' sensitive computer
equipment is vulnerable to the creation of an electric charge from
passing meteors.
</P>
<P>
   And, it turns out, nothing can repair them once their systems
fail. ``There's no repair crew at 22,300 miles,'' said Jimmy
Schaeffler, president of the Carmel Group, which tracks the
satellite industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're human beings playing with the biggest part of nature
there is, the rest of the universe,'' Schaeffler said.
</P>
<P>
   Several recent events point out the problems with heavy reliance
on satellites:
</P>
<P>
   _In May, PanAmSat Corp.'s Galaxy IV suffered a complete failure,
knocking out pager service, television transmission and credit card
verification services. That satellite is now space debris, and its
services were switched to other satellites _ but only after a
three-day outage.
</P>
<P>
   _Two other satellites _ like Galaxy IV, also made by Hughes
Space and Communications Co. _ suffered similar failures this year,
but their backup processors kicked in effectively and they continue
to work. One provides service for DirecTV, a home television
service, and the other is also a PanAmSat ``bird,'' as they're
known in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   _An $85 million Boeing Delta III rocket _ carrying PanAmSat's
Galaxy X satellite _ blew up moments after lift-off at Cape
Canaveral August 26, only two weeks after a classified U.S. Air
Force Titan 4A rocket carrying a satellite also exploded at Cape
Canaveral.
</P>
<P>
   ``The satellite industry has hit a momentary bump in the road,''
said Dan Marcus, a spokesman for PanAmSat in Greenwich, Conn. But,
he said, satellites' reliability remains well above 90 percent, and
launches also are successful 90 percent of the time. ``We're
talking about a very reliable communications infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus said the high profile failures, and particularly the
Galaxy IV failure, pulled back the curtain on a typically low-key
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most cases, satellites are invisible to our activities, and
that's as it should be,'' Marcus said. The recent stumbles
``brought home for the day-to-day consumer that there is this
infrastructure out there that is very important.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent &UR;  &LR; failures are all under investigation, but they are
not enough to abort future missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more satellites being launched this year, last year
and the coming year than in the whole 25 years of launching
satellites,'' said Maya Tse, an analyst with Frost and Sullivan in
Mountain View.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Globalstar of San Jose estimated that the number of
satellites will double to more than 1,200 in space in the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Globalstar assured investors that it was still proceeding with
plans to launch a total of 52 low-Earth orbiting satellites to
build a new type of telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium, a Motorola spin-off, is close to completing its $5
billion satellite network that will provide phone service anywhere
on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Between Globalstar and Iridium, more than 30 million phones are
expected to use satellite technology by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   While Globalstar's stock, and the stock of its main investor,
Loral Space and Communications, took a big hit after the failure,
analysts said insurance coverage and contingency plans mean that
the company is probably safe for the long term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you're in the industry, it all looks kind of alarming,
but it really isn't. It's all part of doing business,'' Tse said.
</P>
<P>
   PanAmSat, which has 16 satellites in high orbit, was barely
slowed down by the Delta III explosion. Marcus is joining other
company officials in French Guyana next Wednesday for yet another
launch, this time of a PAS-7 satellite on a French-made Arine 4
rocket.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite will assume a spot over the Indian Ocean,
providing television, business and Internet service to Europe,
Africa, the Middle East and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to plan.

   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ New York Giants linebacker Jessie
Armstead worked out lightly Friday and again insisted that he would
try to play with a sprained ankle against the Oakland Raiders on
Sunday, although he was aware of the risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can injure it more,'' said Armstead, who injured the ankle
in last Sunday's season opener against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to get one play out of it,'' Armstead said. ``I'm
going to come full speed. I don't know about the second play, but
that first one I'm going all out.''
</P>
<P>
   If Armstead cannot play, the job will fall to Scott Galyon.

 Internet Cuts Out the Media Middlemen With Starr's Report   By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Scholars say the media only mirrors trends in the larger society.
<TEXT>
<P>
   If that is so, then our newest medium, the Internet, is giving
us a long, hard look at ourselves through the voyeuristic lens of
the Kenneth Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   When University of Maryland public policy professor Bill Galston
peered into that lens, he saw a trend that tech types like to talk
about _ disintermediation, that is, cutting out the middleman, and
letting producers deal directly with consumers.
</P>
<P>
   An example of disintermediation in business is when people use
ATM cards instead of banks to get their money. When Congress put
independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report on the Web, it cut out
the media middlemen and let interested members of the public point
and click straight to the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always so, Galston said. News, even scandals, used to
be filtered and predigested by pipe-puffing anchors, union bosses,
local party hacks and ministers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, ordinary citizens got direct access to primary
political information at virtually the same time as the
president,'' Galston said. ``This is the ultimate in political
disintermediation.''
</P>
<P>
   But before you cheer the Web's democratic power, consider this
critique from cyber-journalist Brock Meeks, a longtime member of
the WELL, the online community headquartered in Sausalito.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the Lewinsky report is important and should be on the
Web, said Meeks, who edits his own newsletter, the CyberWire
Dispatch. But why hasn't Congress provided point-and-click access
to other, less salacious but no less important, public documents,
like the voting records of members of Congress?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no technological reason for this, it's all
political,'' said Meeks, who chalks up the speedy dissemination of
Starr's report to ``breathtaking hypocrisy'' on the part of House
Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Farber, a University of Pennsylvania computer scientist and
Web watcher, saw a different irony in Congress' rush to Web-cast
the report. After all, these were the same solons who passed the
Communications Decency Act, which would have banned smut on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Supreme Court hadn't struck down the CDA, I don't think
the report could have been published,'' Farber said. ``Congress
takes the position of controlling what we say, but not when it's
good propaganda.''
</P>
<P>
   Marin Web guru Howard Rheingold said the radical aspect of the
Internet is not so much that it lets people get news, but that it
lets anyone anywhere who's interested jump in and discuss it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important question is whether people are going to
continue to be spectators, or whether the Internet will let them
participate in public arguments.''
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of places to jump into the discussion, like SF
Gate's conferences  &LR; (sfgate.com &LR; ) which are affiliated with The
Chronicle; literary magazine Salon, which has led some of the
coverage, also has a vibrant conference area
 &LR; (www.salonmagazine.com) &LR; . DejaNews  &LR; (www.dejanews.com &LR; ) will
direct you to the wild and wooly Usenet groups where people are
talking about the event.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Visa fight:  &LR; High-tech execs are hoping the House of
Representatives will vote next week on a bill to raise the quota of
skilled foreign professionals granted H-1B visas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we've got the votes to bring this to the floor,''
said Mary Dee Beall, government affairs coordinator for
Hewlett-Packard. The Senate has already passed a similar bill that
high-tech likes. If the House follows suit, the measure could land
on President Clinton's desk before Congress adjourns in October.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents, led by organized labor, said White House
representatives told them yesterday that Clinton is still committed
to vetoing the H-1B bill unless Congress adds more protections for
laid-off workers _ something high-tech firms have resisted.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewinsky scandal complicates everything. It could play to
tech's hand, by weakening Clinton's veto threat. Or labor could get
an assist, if the House gets preoccupied with impeachment talks and
sidetracks an H-1B vote.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Spin control:  &LR; In Thursday's column on digital music, I
incorrectly said a2b Music in New York is a spin-off of AT&AMP;T, when
it is still part of AT&AMP;T Labs.

N.Y. STATE WILL GET $96.9 MILLION TO EASE SHIFT OFF WELFARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The federal government announced Friday that it was
awarding a $96.9 million grant to New York state to help welfare
recipients make the transition to regular jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The grant _ $58.4 million of it for New York City _ will be used
to pay for child care, training and transportation in an effort to
provide the support that welfare recipients need to hold jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to insure that when New York's newest workers get
jobs, they can keep them,'' Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said
Friday in a statement. ``These funds will help some of the
hardest-to-serve welfare recipients get the support services they
need, which can make the difference between success and failure.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Friday, Herman added that the federal
government was requiring New York State to put up $48 million in
matching funds to supplement the federal welfare-to-work grant.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of the money, government officials said, will
be concentrated on chronically unemployed recipients who lack high
school diplomas and have low math and reading scores, poor work
histories and substance abuse problems.
</P>
<P>
   The grant is part of $2.2 billion in federal money being awarded
to states over a two-year period to finance local programs to help
long-term welfare recipients hold jobs as federal legislation
requires states and cities to move hundreds of thousands of such
people into jobs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   State and city officials welcomed the grant money. ``It's a
recognition that New York City and New York state are on the
cutting edge of welfare reform,'' said Anthony Coles, senior
adviser to New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. ``The money is
going to be used to expand our efforts to move people into work''
and ``move more people from dependency into self-sufficiency.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in large part to cuts in the welfare rolls in New York
City, the number of welfare recipients statewide has fallen by
547,000, or 30 percent, over the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had tremendous success in reducing the welfare rolls in
New York state under Governor Pataki,'' said Michael McKeon, a
spokesman for Gov. George Pataki. ``This grant will help us
continue that success by targeting those people who need extra help
in getting off of welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-five percent of the money going to New York state will be
distributed to individual counties; Pataki's office will distribute
the remaining 15 percent to strengthen employment services for
people with special needs and to publicize services for
welfare-to-work programs.
</P>
<P>
   The grant money can also be used for housing, substance-abuse
treatment and job creation programs through wage subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   New York is the 38th state to receive a grant under this federal
welfare-to-work program. The Labor Department is completing its
work before announcing a grant for New Jersey, and it has already
awarded $12 million to Connecticut for work transition programs.
The federal government is also making $711 million in grants
available on a competitive basis to community-based organizations
helping welfare recipients make the transition to work.

THE MAYOR'S ANGRY RESPONSE IS HAILED BY BLACK LEADERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also NY-CHANNEL-PARADE)  
(js) 
 By ALAN FINDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Black political and religious leaders on Friday
applauded Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's swift condemnation of a racially
offensive float in a Labor Day parade in Queens. But they also
continued to criticize the mayor's support for the aggressive
tactics used by the police at a Harlem youth rally last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is doing the right thing,'' the Rev. Calvin Butts
III, pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, said of
Giuliani's response to the float in the Labor Day parade in Broad
Channel, Queens, in which a group of white men, including off-duty
firefighters and possibly police officers, cavorted in blackface
and mocked black Americans. At one point they made fun of the
killing this summer of a black man in Texas, who was dragged to his
death behind a pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   City officials suspended two firefighters Friday and the mayor
said he hoped that the action would lead to the dismissal of any
city workers involved with the float.
</P>
<P>
   ``His statements thus far have been appropriate and to the
point,'' said Butts, who has been harshly critical of Giuliani
recently, calling him a racist in May. ``I don't think that there
is any more that he can do.''
</P>
<P>
   That view was shared by many other prominent African-American
New Yorkers, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, who is often at odds
with the mayor. But many of the religious and political leaders
also said that Giuliani's words and actions over the last two days,
as details about the Labor Day float emerged, had not changed their
negative view of how the mayor and the Police Department had
handled the rally in Harlem, known as the Million Youth March, last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani can be quick to condemn the racist actions of others,
they said, but he is sometimes insensitive to how his own words or
actions are perceived by black New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I applaud Mayor Giuliani's denunciation of the horrible
depiction of that terrible crime in Jasper, Texas, but it doesn't
buy him a ticket to heaven from me or anybody in the Harlem
community,'' said state Sen. David Paterson, who represents Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Paterson, among many others, contended that the Police
Department had been much too aggressive in controlling the
relatively small crowd, estimated at 6,000 people, that gathered
last Saturday afternoon at the youth rally organized by Khallid
Abdul Muhammad. Giuliani and police officials have said that a huge
police presence was necessary because of Muhammad's threats of
violence and his claims that tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of
people would turn out for the event.
</P>
<P>
   But many political and religious leaders maintain that the use
of police helicopters and officers in riot gear was an overreaction
by the mayor and police commanders _ particularly because, until
the last minutes of the rally, the crowd was peaceful, even if the
oratory of many of the speakers was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have the police there in those kind of numbers, to have the
helicopters overhead, to pull the plug at the end, that was a kind
of disrespect, not to Khallid Muhammad, but to the people of
Harlem,'' Butts said. ``That hurts the mayor. People say, `What is
this?' ''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The bottom line, Butts contended, is that the mayor does not
understand how his words and actions are perceived by black New
Yorkers, and he does not listen to those who might explain those
perceptions to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I called him a racist, it was not because I hate him,''
Butts said. ``It was because I love him. I want him to get a clear
understanding of what's happening out here, how he is understood
and seen. I pray for him. I really do think he is a better person
than he comes across.''
</P>
<P>
   Butts, Paterson and many others said that the gulf between the
mayor and many black New Yorkers expanded this week when he refused
a request from the Manhattan borough president, C. Virginia Fields,
to meet with her and other elected officials from Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the issue is a lack of inclusion and not listening to
a whole community of people,'' said Paterson, who characterized the
mayor's refusal to meet with Ms. Fields as ``a dogmatic tantrum
rather than civil conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   And while many people said they were willing to accept the
mayor's denunciation of the Labor Day float at face value, others
said they thought his response was motivated, in part, by the
bitter feelings that remain from the Harlem rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the mayor has tried to use his reaction to the float
to try in some ways to neutralize the criticism he's gotten from
many quarters on how he handled the youth march,'' Sharpton said,
adding that Giuliani may not have the power to dismiss any city
employee involved with the float.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important that he be swift,'' Sharpton said. ``I
think he was right to be unequivocal that it was inappropriate,
even if I suspect his motives. I think he did the right thing, but
I think he has to be careful about promising what he cannot
deliver.''

   It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Financial World &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The drop in stock prices accelerated on Thursday as worries
increased about the Clinton presidency and the global economy. The
Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 249.48 points, or 3.17
percent, to 7,615.54. The blue-chip gauge has fallen 18.4 percent
since its July 17 peak of 9,337.97, nearing the 20 percent figure
designating a bear market. The Dow, however, is 76.47 points above
its low for the year, 7,539.07, reached on Aug. 31. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   STRIKES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Labor's Growing Assertiveness &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The recent strikes at Northwest Airlines, General Motors, Bell
Atlantic and US West represent the biggest surge in major walkouts
in years and, industrial relations experts say, point to a new
aggressiveness on the part of labor unions. (Late in the week,
Northwest pilots reached a tentative agreement with the company.)
</P>
<P>
   For years, unions had shunned large-scale walkouts, remembering
the results of the air traffic controllers' walkout in the early
1980s and, more recently, the strike at Caterpillar. And even
though union membership rolls are slipping and the slowing economy
threatens workers, unions have grown bolder, labor experts say,
because of the tight labor market, more combative union leadership
and the teamsters' gains in last year's UPS strike.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the prominent strikes of this summer, the number of
work stoppages was climbing, to 226 in the first six months of the
year from 214 in the corresponding period of 1997, according to the
Bureau of National Affairs, a private research organization. &QL;

<P>
   Atlanta faces the worst urban sprawl problem among American
cities of more than one million in population, according to a study
by the Sierra Club. (Los Angeles, ``the granddaddy of sprawl,'' was
not included in the study.) The group said that about 500 acres of
green space, forests and farmland disappeared each week in the
Atlanta metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, 10th in urban sprawl, the population of the
metropolitan area grew by 9 percent between 1990 and 1996, but
developed land expanded by 40 percent, the study found. The Sierra
Club said the trend was costing billions of dollars for expanded
roads, sewer and water systems, while destroying needed wetlands,
forests and open spaces for wildlife and adding to air and water
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   The study, reported by The Associated Press, said 400,000 acres
a year were being bulldozed nationwide. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The Poverty of Nations &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even in the world's wealthiest countries, the ranks of the poor
are growing and many people are being denied the basic rewards of
affluence, a United Nations report said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 16.5 percent of Americans live in poverty, even
though the United States leads the world in per-capita consumption
of goods and services. Sweden was ranked the best among developed
nations in spreading the wealth, with fewer than 7 percent of its
people in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   In the industrialized world, at least 37 million people are
unemployed, 100 million are homeless and nearly 200 million have a
life expectancy of less than 60 years, the report said. Many
African nations were at the bottom of the list. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AFFIRMATIVE ACTION &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A New Perspective &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A major new study of the records and experiences of tens of
thousands of students at some of the nation's top colleges and
universities concludes that their affirmative-action policies
created the backbone of the black middle class and taught white
classmates the value of integration.
</P>
<P>
   The study was written by two former Ivy League presidents,
William Bowen of Princeton, an economist, and Derek Bok of Harvard,
a political scientist, and begins by documenting the situation:
Blacks who enter elite institutions generally do so with lower test
scores and grades than those of whites. And as they work their way
through liberal arts colleges black students generally receive
lower grades and graduate at a lower rate.
</P>
<P>
   But after graduation, the survey found, these students achieve
notable successes. They earn advanced degrees at rates identical to
those of their white classmates, and they are even slightly more
likely than whites from the same institutions to obtain
professional degrees in law, business and medicine. And they become
more active than their white classmates in civic and community
activities. &QL;

   JAPAN &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why Not Just Give It Away? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese central bank lowered a key interest rate to the
extraordinarily low level of one-quarter of 1 percent in an
attempt, by making funds cheaper, to bring the economy out of its
worst recession since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   But with Japanese interest rates negligible, it will be
difficult for the central bank to navigate monetary policy. At the
end of the week, the central bank summed up the situation:
``Japan's economic conditions continue to deteriorate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nikkei, the benchmark Japanese stock index, responded by
plummeting more than 5 percent. The response of some businesses,
like the Tokyo computer store above, has been to hang out the sale
signs. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   THE ECONOMY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sky's the (Deficit) Limit &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The United States trade deficit in goods, services and
investments widened to a record $56.53 billion in the second
quarter. Net foreign purchases of Treasury securities increased as
international investors shifted out of United States stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The current account balance is the broadest measure of the
nation's international trade, covering goods and services,
investments and financial transactions between governments.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter, the current account shortfall widened to
$46.74 billion. ... Wholesale inventories fell 0.2 percent in July,
to a seasonally adjusted $276.9 billion, after a 0.1 percent drop
in June. They were the first back-to-back monthly declines since
August and September 1996. &QL;

<P>
   RUSSIA &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pink and Proud of It &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin named Foreign Minister Yevgeny M.
Primakov, architect of Russia's hard-line foreign policy, as his
compromise candidate to head a new government. The nomination of
Primakov, the veteran diplomat and spymaster, a cool-headed
survivor from the Soviet era who has stayed above Russia's
political battles, was quickly approved and welcomed by a wide
range of political leaders, including the Communists. (Referring to
Primakov, one newspaper editor said: ``He is not red. But he is a
bit pink.'')
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics said Primakov, who has no background in economic
management, would be hard pressed to find a formula that would let
him keep his job as well as steer the country out of its economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't be able to manage the situation because he is not an
economist,'' said Anna Sichova, 20, a graduate student. But Nikolai
Maltsev, 70, a social science professor, saw him as the the best of
the available compromise choices. ``He is a straightforward person,
and he is very realistic,'' Maltsev said. Many Russians were
probably more concerned about empty shops than political promises. &QL;

<P>
   BRAZIL &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Asian Flu, Latin Beat &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brazil finally succumbed to the malaise afflicting world
markets. The Sao Paulo exchange closed down 15.8 percent on
Thursday, and trading was halted twice in one day for the first
time in its history, leaving many traders holding their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Standard &AMP; Poor's lowered its country rating on Brazil to
negative, putting it in the same category as Jordan, Lebanon,
Paraguay and Bolivia, and by Thursday evening at least $1.7 billion
in foreign reserves had poured out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, Moody's also downgraded Brazil. With the world's
ninth-largest economy and half of South America's population,
Brazil is seen as a bellwether for the region, and the country most
capable of ushering in a Latin version of the turbulence that has
roiled Asia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The selloff on Thursday was hardly limited to Brazil. Markets
fell 9.8 percent in Mexico, 13.3 percent in Argentina, and 7.4
percent in Chile.

   NEW YORK _ Despite a questionable line call last month in
Cincinnati, it is not yet a compelling rivalry. But Patrick Rafter
is a single victory away from making it one. All he must do is find
a way to attack Pete Sampras successfully Saturday afternoon in the
semifinals of Sampras' national championship.
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds daunting, it is, and what makes it trickier is
that Sampras is one of the best Grand Slam closers in history and
has rarely had more history to play for than on this final weekend
of the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   The American who grew up watching video of the great Australians
is two victories from matching the career record of Roy Emerson,
who has won more Grand Slam singles titles (12) than any other man.
Emerson may not be the most appropriate Australian to hold that
record: Rod Laver, who won 11, did not play the Grand Slam events
for five years in the 1960s because he was ineligible as a
professional.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Sampras has a more elemental connection with Laver,
Emerson is the tennis legend in Sampras' sights. And when Sampras
takes the court Saturday, he will be facing a player whose
net-rushing, chipping-and-charging style is reminiscent of Emerson.
</P>
<P>
   That style was good enough to win Rafter his first and only
Grand Slam singles title last year at this tournament, and Rafter
has yet to lose inside Arthur Ashe Stadium, where windy and quick
conditions have prevailed the last two years. He has been the best
hardcourt player in the world this summer, but in his career he has
beaten Sampras only twice in 10 matches.
</P>
<P>
   The first of those victories came in their first match in 1993
in Indianapolis; the second came last month in the final in
Cincinnati, where Sampras uncharacteristically lost his temper in
the third set after a questionable line call and lost the match,
1-6, 7-6, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he got under my skin; I think the situation
did,'' Sampras said. ``Having the match in my hands, letting it
slip away, being a little frustrated at how the match was going,
and then getting a tough line call when I had a bit of a reputation
with the chair umpire in the past. It was just a bad call. I just
lost it for like a minute. That's fine. I'm glad I did it. Made me
feel much better, trust me.''
</P>
<P>
   He then added: ``Don't worry. I won't lose my control on
Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   The more important issue is how he controls Rafter's serve,
which has helped foment a serve-and-volley renaissance here the
last two years. There are no mysteries surrounding Rafter's
approach. He will rush the net whenever possible, and if Sampras
can return well enough to keep Rafter from volleying effectively,
he will widen his career edge over the Australian.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras must also serve well enough to keep Rafter from
attacking his second serves. With Rafter pushing forward, this
match is intriguing. With Rafter on the baseline, it is no contest.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If Sampras does win, he could face another hard-charging
Australian in the final. After saving three match points in his
five-set tussle with Thomas Johansson on Thursday night, Mark
Philippoussis will now face the French Open champion, Carlos Moya,
in Saturday's first semifinal. Moya saved three match points of his
own against Michael Chang in the second round. Both he and his
opponent Saturday are powerful athletes. Moya is 6 feet 3 inches
and 22 years old; Philippoussis is 6-4 and 21.
</P>
<P>
   In their only previous meeting, Philippoussis won in straight
sets on a hardcourt in Indian Wells, Calif., but Moya, despite his
Barcelona training base and excellent groundstrokes, is more than a
Spanish clay-courter. He reached the final of the Australian Open
in 1997 and is gradually acquiring a reputation as a player who
rises to the big occasion.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, however, Sampras is the reference. ``I won't go
onto the court feeling as intimidated as I had before,'' Rafter
said. ``But I'm still going to be very intimidated. He's just that
sort of player.''

BELMONT'S BIG FALL MEETING BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>

 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York racing switched downstate Friday after a
booming six-week run in Saratoga and opened a 33-day meeting at
Belmont Park that features 40 stakes, the long-awaited ``race of
the year'' in next Saturday's Woodward, the countdown to the
Breeders' Cup, the divisional championships and the final hometown
performances for Skip Away and Coronado's Quest.
</P>
<P>
   Belmont opened its doors on a clear and cool September afternoon
with its 2,200 stalls filled for the fall season and two Grade I
stakes Saturday: the $400,000 Man o' War on the turf and the
$200,000 Gazelle Handicap for fillies.
</P>
<P>
   Nine horses are entered in the Man o' War, led by Cetewayo,
winner of five of his last six starts, and Buck's Boy, a dangerous
speed horse who has won three of his last four and lost only in
that streak to the champion turf horse, Chief Bearhart. But both
will have to outrun Ireland's Daylami, who makes his U.S. debut
under Jerry Bailey after running in the money in 11 of his 12
starts in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Gazelle features an all-star cast of fillies trying to pass
the injured Jersey Girl for the division championship. They are led
by the favorite, Keeper Hill, winner of the Kentucky Oaks and
Countess Diana, last year's juvenile champion.
</P>
<P>
   Backstage at Belmont, the country's big horses were preparing
for the Woodward as the marquee race of the year, with its three
older stars _ Skip Away, Free House and Gentlemen _ and the cream
of the 3-year-olds, Coronado's Quest, the winner of the Travers
last month at Saratoga. The only major horse not likely to appear
in the Woodward is Victory Gallop, the winner of the Belmont
Stakes, who will run instead in the $750,000 Super Derby at
Louisiana Downs.
</P>
<P>
   The $500,000 Woodward could be the first of three races in six
weeks' time that will decide who is the Horse of the Year. It will
be followed by the $1 million Jockey Club Gold Cup on Oct. 10 at
Belmont Park and the $4 million Breeders' Cup Classic on Nov. 7 at
Churchill Downs.  &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Monica Lewinsky told investigators that Vernon
Jordan, a top Washington lawyer and longtime confidant of President
Clinton, directed her to destroy evidence of her relationship with
Clinton, according to the Starr report made public Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan was also actively involved in seeking a job for Ms.
Lewinsky, and when he succeeded, according to the report, he called
up Clinton and declared: ``Mission accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of his investigation over the last several months,
Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, has been trying to
determine whether Jordan had asked Ms. Lewinsky to lie under oath
about her relationship with the president. Jordan has emphatically
denied that he asked her to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's voluminous report makes no assertions about whether
Jordan is guilty of any criminal wrongdoing. But it paints a
portrait of him as a central player swept up in the Lewinsky
melodrama, serving as a go-between, a one-man employment agency and
an emotional bedrock for a distraught young woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in love, that's what your problem is,'' Jordan told Ms.
Lewinsky last December, after she had complained to him that she
got angry at the president ``when he doesn't call me enough or see
me enough.'' Jordan advised the former White House intern to take
her frustrations out on him rather than on Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan became Ms. Lewinsky's confidant in part because she
assumed with ``a wink and a nod'' that Jordan was fully aware of
her sexual relationship with the president. But the report also
suggests that Jordan wanted to protect Clinton and secure Ms.
Lewinsky's silence as she faced a subpoena in the Paula Jones
sexual harassment case.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Jordan nor his lawyer, William Hundley, were available
Friday for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Several days after she was subpoened on Dec. 19, 1997, Jordan
advised Ms. Lewinsky to throw out copies of notes that she had
written to the president, she testified. She was afraid that her
erstwhile friend, Linda Tripp, had seen them.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to Ms. Lewinsky, Jordan said: `Go home and make sure
they're not there,''' the report said. Ms. Lewinsky testified that
she understood that Jordan was advising her to throw away any
copies or drafts of notes that she had sent to the president. It
said Ms. Lewinsky then went home and discarded copies of
approximately 50 notes she had written to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jordan testified to Starr's grand jury that both
Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky lied to him and told him they were not
sexually involved, the report suggests that Jordan suspected they
were. According to the report, when she received the subpoena, she
burst into tears and called Jordan from a pay phone at the
Pentagon. She appeared in his office in a highly emotional state
within an hour or so, dropping broad hints of a sexual liaison.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said she seemed ``mesmerized'' by the president. She
asked Jordan if Clinton was likely to stay married to Hillary
Rodham Clinton. And when Ms. Lewinsky left his office, she asked
Jordan to ``give the president a hug'' for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't have to be Einstein'' to figure out they were
probably involved, Jordan told investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan asked her whether she was. She testified that ``at this
time she assumed that Jordan knew with a wink and a nod that she
was having a relationship with the president,'' the report said.
``She therefore interpreted Jordan's questions as `What are you
going to say?' rather than `What are the actual answers?'''
</P>
<P>
   That same night, Jordan, a presidential golfing buddy who has
boasted that his bond with Clinton allows for ``a little
locker-room talk,'' went to the White House and asked Clinton point
blank if he had had sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, never,'' the president told him, Jordan testified.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Jan. 22, in a public statement, Jordan told reporters
``absolutely and unequivocally'' that Ms. Lewinsky had denied to
him that she was involved with the president.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that Jordan, who had promised Ms. Lewinsky on
Nov. 5 to help her find a job, got into gear only after she had
been subpoenaed _ suggesting that Jordan wanted to protect the
president and buy Ms. Lewinsky's silence.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that in October 1997, Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky
discussed enlisting Jordan in a job search because she wanted to
work in the private sector and he was so well connected, sitting on
the boards of numerous corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence indicates, though, that Jordan took no steps to
help Ms. Lewinsky until early December, after she appeared on the
witness list in the Jones case,'' the report stated.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan then found Ms. Lewinsky a job with Revlon. He contacted
Ronald Perelman, the New York financier whose company has a
majority interest in the cosmetics company. When she accepted the
job in January, Jordan called the president and said, ``Mission
accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   The company withdrew the offer after the Starr investigation
became public later that month.

 &HT;    2 HRs grand for Williams
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A win streak. What a concept.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Williams went wild with a pair of homers, including a
grand slam, and John Smoltz cruised to his 15th victory as the
Braves defeated Florida 8-2 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Still chilled by a 2-8 slump, the win gave the Braves
consecutive wins for the first time in two weeks and, teamed with
New York's loss to Montreal, reduced the Braves' magic number to
three for clinching the NL East.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz (15-3) allowed two runs on six hits in seven innings
while striking out eight, giving him 20 strikeouts in his last 16
innings. Now 10-1 since the All-Star break, he gives the Braves
four 15-game winners for just the second time this century (the
first in 1993).
</P>
<P>
   With a grand slam in the third inning and a solo homer in the
fifth, Williams recorded the first five-RBI game of his career and
his second two-homer game. He also singled in the seventh, stole a
base and scored the Braves' seventh run.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' second homer, a solo shot in the fifth, came on the
third pitch of the night by Marlins reliever Eric Ludwick and
provided Atlanta a 6-1 lead. It was the Braves' 57th multi-homer
game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz took a no-hitter into the fifth, when the Marlins strung
together three singles and a walk to make it 5-1, Todd Dunwoody
driving an 0-2 fastball through the right side for the RBI. The
Marlins added a second run in the sixth on Luis Castillo's two-out
RBI-single.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz gave the Braves a 5-0 lead in the fourth, after Tony
Graffanino hit a two-out double off Florida starter Kirt Ojala.
Smoltz worked the count to 2-2 before sending a single up the
middle for his fifth RBI of the season. Ojala was pulled after the
inning, having allowed four hits and walked four while striking out
none.
</P>
<P>
   Ojala, who defeated the Braves June 17 in a relief performance,
pitched himself straight into a 4-0 Braves lead in the third after
facing the minimum in the first two innings. He opened by walking
left-handed Ryan Klesko (.216 versus left-handed pitching this
year) and then allowed a single to Graffanino, in the throes of a
3-for-27 slump.
</P>
<P>
   After Smoltz's sacrifice bunt, Ojala then loaded the bases by
walking Walt Weiss in just his second at-bat in nine games to bring
up Williams, who came to the plate hitting .344 with runners in
scoring position. Williams swung wildly at a high curve but found
Ojala's second pitch, a slider over the inside half of the plate,
to his liking, pulling the ball nearly into the second section of
the lower deck down the left-field line.
</P>
<P>
   The grand slam was Williams' second of his career, the Braves'
fourth this season but the 100th slam in Atlanta history. Of
Williams' seven homers this season, four have come with men on
base, accounting for 11 RBIs.

 &HT;    Neagle figures he's one start away
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only four days after a cortisone shot to his left shoulder to
treat a case of bursitis, Denny Neagle threw for the first time in
a week Friday evening, the timing prompting Braves manager Bobby
Cox to grant Bruce Chen his second major-league start tonight
against the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle expects to pitch again Thursday, when his regular turn
comes up in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had a two-game lead with two games to make the playoffs,
sure, I'd pitch,'' Neagle said. ``But I'm not going to rag it out
there at 80 or 90 percent when I can be 100 percent in my last two
starts and then 100 percent in the playoffs, obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Neagle returned from New York Monday to have his shoulder
checked, he did not have the injection until Tuesday, to give team
orthopedist Joe Chandler a chance to review an MRI. Neagle's
shoulder had grown sore to the touch and he could not throw above a
three-quarters delivery Sunday. In his last start Sept. 1 against
Houston, he was slow to loosen up and allowed a home run and two
triples.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those things you just don't talk about. I
happens,'' he said. ``Every pitcher goes through it. Every pitcher
has his own way of dealing with it. I always get mine the third
week of spring training and then in late August or early
September.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen, called to Atlanta after just four Class AAA outings, hopes
to improve upon his debut, when he have up six hits (includer two
homers) and four runs in three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Strange but true
</P>
<P>
   On successive nights, the Braves saw both components of their
starting middle infield in the lineup, a first this month.
Shortstop Walt Weiss (left quadriceps) made his first start Friday
since Aug. 31, one night after second baseman Keith Lockhart (right
hamstring) made his first start since Sept 1. With two weeks
remaining in the regular season, another setback for either player
becomes a major issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing everything we can,'' said Cox. ``Walt has made
progress. I'm not sure he feels it very much at all. In Lockhart's
case, it goes and comes. He's had his good days and some not so
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss, who played his first game after a Sept. 1 cortisone
injection, said he is in his best playing shape in years for this
late in the season.

 &HT;    On Deck: Florida Marlins
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: Tonight at 7:10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   TV, radio: TBS, WSB 750-AM.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: Tonight, LHP Bruce Chen (0-0, 12.00;
first appearance vs. Marlins) vs. RHP Livan Hernandez (10-11, 4.87;
0-1, 5.02 lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Chen gets his second major-league start, after the team
decided to give Denny Neagle another few days to test his sore left
shoulder. Chen lasted three innings Monday in New York in his
debut. He gave up six hits, including two homers, and allowed nine
of the 16 men he faced to reach base. Hernandez would welcome some
of that right now. The Marlins No. 1 starter is winless in his last
five starts, 1-4 in his last seven starts and 3-7 since the
All-Star break. His last five outings have been brutal _ 51 hits,
20 walks and 26 runs allowed in 31 1/3 innings. Hernandez has faced
Atlanta once this year, losing 6-4 at Pro Player Stadium on July 9
in the first game after the All-Star break. Chipper Jones, Javy
Lopez and Gerald Williams hit home runs off him that night.
</P>
<P>
   Who's hot: OF Cliff Floyd had three homers in the first three
games of the Marlins' current 13-game road trip. RHP Vic
Darrensbourg has yielded just one hit in his last four appearances.
Mark Kotsay is hitting .333 over the last few days.

 &HT;    Forget question marks, Braves look plain flimsy
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, there's this team. (It actually exists, but for the moment
we won't reveal its identity.) It has four good-to-excellent
everyday players. It has outstanding starting pitching. It has a
shaky bullpen, a weak outfield, an infirm middle-of-the-infield.
Without naming names or being swayed by reputation, where would you
figure such a team should finish?
</P>
<P>
   Above .500, sure. (Starting pitching alone would account for
that.) Likely in the playoffs as a wild-card entrant, perhaps even
as the winner of a weak division. But would this team be favored to
reach the World Series? Would it be regarded as the standard of
excellence within its league? It would not.
</P>
<P>
   The team described above is the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   This will mark the seventh consecutive postseason for which the
Braves have qualified, and never have they looked so flimsy going
in. They may or may not hold the National League's best record
after 162 games, but if they do it will be a function of their
continuing ability to whip up on small fry. In nearly every test of
strength since Memorial Day, the Braves have been found wanting.
</P>
<P>
   They lost three of four to the Yankees, two of three to the Red
Sox. They were swept at Wrigley Field in late May. They lost three
of four at Shea over Labor Day. In home-and-home late-summer series
with both San Diego and Houston, the Braves were an aggregate 4-6.
On the heralded night Greg Maddux faced Kerry Wood, the Cubs won.
On the similarly celebrated night Maddux opposed Randy Johnson,
Houston won.
</P>
<P>
   The longer the season has gone, the more apparent it has become
that this is the weakest band of Braves since the team got good,
that its lofty record flatters to deceive. More than mere soft
spots, this team has actual holes. You can win a World Series with
the former, not often with the latter.
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 Braves won with an outfield of Ryan Klesko/Mike
Devereaux in left, Marquis Grissom in center, David Justice in
right. The latter two were proven professionals. They have been
replaced by Andruw Jones, an immense talent but not yet an
All-Star, and Michael Tucker, who's a fourth outfielder at best.
Instead of a workable platoon in left, the Braves now go with
Klesko alone, who (a.) can't hit lefties, and (b.) has hit three
home runs since June.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, even among the many stars of the '95 team, how Mark
Wohlers loomed as the single indispensable man? Now we see why.
After an initial blush of improbable success, the
Ligtenberg-Seanez-Rocker troika has been undone by increased use or
increasing familiarity. The Braves had three blown saves in June
and July; since August 28 they've had five.
</P>
<P>
   The reason the Braves are again bound for October is that the
starting pitching managed to mask other flaws, as starting pitching
will. But let Denny Neagle come down with a sore arm and Maddux
with a case of the mortals, and suddenly nothing looks all that
good. Is it possible that the pitching will kick in come the
playoffs, that everyone else will overachieve? Possible, yes. But
for the first time since the worst-to-first run of '91,
overachievement will be required.

 &HT;    State adopts new rules to curb foodborne illness
 &HT;    By Kitty Crider
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ At a time when Americans are eating more than 50
percent of their meals out and when foodborne illness appears to be
increasing, the State Board of Health took a step toward improved
food safety Friday by adopting new regulations for restaurants,
supermarkets, snack bars and other retail food establishments.
</P>
<P>
   The new 142-page regulatory food code is the first major
revision for Texas since 1977. Most of the details of the revised
code were not made public at the board meeting.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said the regulations, which go into effect in
mid-October, are patterned after the non-mandatory 1997 federal
Food and Drug Administration guidelines, already adopted by a dozen
other states. They will become the state's minimum standards, which
local governments must follow. Home-rule cities such as Austin can
adopt more stringent guidelines if they choose.
</P>
<P>
   Steve McAndrew, director of the retail food division of the
Texas Department of Health, says the regulations are improved,
needed and take into account new science and technology. ``We are
now focussing on those items that are most directly related to
foodborne illness: time/temperature relationships, personal
hygiene, cross-contamination between raw and cooked foods,'' said
McAndrew, who declined to provide a copy of the new code following
its adoption.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control estimates that between 6.5
million and 81 million cases of foodborne illness occur a year,
9,000 of them resulting in death. No one really knows the exact
number of cases because foodborne illness is grossly underreported.
Most cases involve 24- to 48-hour, intestinal-flu-like symptoms
that don't require a visit to the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest and most controversial change under the new
regulations requires food establishments to reduce the maximum
temperature of their refrigeration units from 45 to 41 degrees (5
degrees C.). This recommendation was made by the FDA in its 1993,
1995 and 1997 food codes. While a 4-degree reduction may not sound
like a big difference, in fact, it is. According to the FDA, a
41-degree temperature significantly slows the growth of organisms
like salmonella, listeria , yersinia, the vibrios and other
organisms that can cause foodborne illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The 41-degree regulation also would be in harmony with U.S.
Department of Agriculture guidelines as well as Canadian and
European requirements, an important consideration as food becomes
increasingly global.
</P>
<P>
   Some Texas cities have not waited for the state code to lower
their refrigeration case maximum temperatures to 41 degrees. Plano
made the change in 1993, but others such as Austin have elected to
wait until the new state code is adopted.
</P>
<P>
   The temperature change has been controversial because it could
require many food establishments to purchase new equipment. The
state is giving these establishments five years _ and in some cases
longer _ to replace various refrigeration units.
</P>
<P>
   Another major regulatory change is that prepared foods,
potentially hazardous foods and opened packaged foods in
restaurants will be required to be date-marked and have specific
shelf lives.
</P>
<P>
   Industry representatives, regulators and local health
departments have had input in the new regulations. Four public
hearings in May drew over 250 comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We support the rules in the report,'' Glen Garey, general
counsel for the Texas Restaurant Association, said at the board
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   He noted later that the new rules focus on the things most
likely to cause foodborne illness _improper storage, cooking and
sanitation (especially unclean hands) _ rather than previous
physical requirements, such as whether the lights are covered, that
had little direct impact on illness.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Wright of San Diego, Calif., regulatory affairs manager for
Foodmaker Inc., spoke for the code changes. ``It's in everyone's
best interest,'' she said. Foodmaker is the parent company of Jack
in the Box, which has 372 stores in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Bell Lockhart, general manager of environmental programs
for the Austin-Travis County Health and Human Services Department,
says the local food industry supports safety measures. ``They know
good sanitation buys them customers, and it is a competitive
industry. They want to be cleaner so customers will come to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The state health department and the restaurant association will
be putting together training programs to educate regulators and the
industry. Cities and counties will disseminate the information to
the food industry through trained food managers at restaurants,
supermarkets, schools, nursing homes, convenience stores, caterers
and other food establishments.
</P>
<P>
   But food safety doesn't stop there. Consumers, too, have a
responsibility not to eat the pizza left out on the den floor
overnight, not to pick up a bucket of chicken and drive hours to
the beach, or handle food without washing their hands after using
the bathroom.

PONCIANO SEES SUNNY FUTURE FOR CSUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHRIDGE, Calif. _ Today, the Big Sky. Tomorrow, the Western
Athletic Conference and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Ponciano has coached Cal State Northridge's football team
for just one game, a 26-13 loss at Boise State. Yet for him, the
place is full of promise, specifically the promise of better
athletes and a stronger schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are attracting a better student-athlete,'' Ponciano said
this week. ``We are legitimately recruiting with Division I teams
and beating them.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Matadors observing a bye in the schedule, Ponciano took
some time after a recent practice to give what sounded like a
``State of the Program'' address.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge has never had it easy operating in close proximity to
USC and UCLA. Those schools have the pick of the elite athletes.
The Matadors' best hope is sloppy seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But Ponciano says things are changing for CSUN. The Southern
California location is as much an advantage as for the Pacific-10
schools, he says. Plus, he reminds, Northridge is a Division I-AA
program.
</P>
<P>
   That means CSUN can begin thinking about games against Division
I-A teams. This year, there was Boise State. There is talk about
going to Wisconsin next year. And Ponciano says several WAC teams
are interested in paying Northridge to come out and be slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically, it balances budgets,'' Ponciano said. ``The
bottom line is, can you compete without getting hurt?''
</P>
<P>
   As for the better class of athlete, the Matadors' starting
roster includes several transfers from I-A programs, among them:
running back Melvin Blue from Utah State, safety Vito Clemente from
UCLA, cornerback Mel Miller from Washington and offensive lineman
Mike Barnes from Arizona State. Plus, Ponciano said, Alvin Steen
and Nathan Davenport chose Northridge over D-I schools because they
could play next season as opposed to their junior or senior years.
</P>
<P>
   Steen, a 6-foot-1, 240-pound redshirt linebacker, spurned the
two Arizona schools, as well as Colorado State and Nevada-Las
Vegas. Davenport, a 6-6, 225-pound tight end, turned down Arizona
and Oregon. He, too, is redshirting this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken a step up,'' Ponciano said.
</P>
<P>
   Know your Lumberjacks: By the time it's Saturday again, the team
will be tired of waiting and ready to play again.
</P>
<P>
   That's partly because Ponciano, when he hasn't given the team
days off, has spent the entire bye week getting his players ready
for next week's game at Northern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``We practice what we know NAU does,'' Ponciano said. ``We think
we have a pretty good idea of what they'll do defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: The prognosis isn't good for the four injured
players. Only defensive lineman Sean Beard (right ankle sprain),
has a chance to play against Northern Arizona. Beard will return to
practice Monday, trainer Rhonda Lowry said.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive lineman Joe Bergman, who missed the Boise State game
after spraining his ankle three weeks ago, is doubtful for
Saturday, Lowry said.
</P>
<P>
   The other two are out. Center Beau Cherry, who tore a knee
ligament in the Boise game, underwent an MRI exam Friday and was
declared out for at least six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive lineman Erik Gardner is out three to four weeks with a
sprained ankle.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth Starr,
built his case for impeachment of President Clinton on an avalanche
of salacious details of the president's affair with Monica Lewinsky
and the Nixon-era concept of abuse of presidential power in using
government aides to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   In a scathing report which the House of Representatives
published to the world Friday, he said the president violated his
oath of office with repeated acts of perjury and obstruction of
justice. He also described in intimate detail Ms. Lewinsky's
account of her many meetings with the president, including 10
sexual encounters.
</P>
<P>
   The House must now judge whether Starr has presented a
compelling case for the impeachment of the president. There is so
much material in the report about his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky, and so much contradictory testimony from the president
and his defenders, that it will take weeks to gauge the power of
the case Starr has built against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The White House angrily responded that the Starr report was a
lurid and politically motivated attempt ``intended to humiliate the
president and force him from office.'' Clinton's lawyers said that
Starr and his team of prosecutors had, after four years of intense
investigative labor, found ``personal, not impeachable'' misconduct
by the president.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Starr's relentlessly accusatory 445-page report
riveted Washington and permanently changed the terms of the debate
over Clinton's fitness for office. Friday, some members of Congress
reacted with outrage, and some with revulsion, at the report's
torrent of embarrassing details about Clinton's sexual relationship
with a woman less than half his age just outside the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   The House, which authorized the release of the report on an
overwhelming bipartisan vote Friday afternoon, will soon begin
deliberations that could lead to the second presidential
impeachment hearings of the century.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 counts of possible impeachable offenses against Clinton _
all of which arose from his liaison with Ms. Lewinsky and not from
Whitewater and other matters Starr has investigated _ echo two of
the articles of impeachment voted against President Richard M.
Nixon in 1974. Nixon was found by the House Judiciary Committee to
have obstructed justice and abused the power of his office in
trying to cover up the Watergate break-in and related offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The report contains allegations of crimes for which Clinton
could face criminal prosecution if he leaves office through
resignation or impeachment. Some prosecutors in Starr's office want
to keep the federal grand jury here in operation for another year
to indict him.
</P>
<P>
   The document describes in graphic detail several of Clinton's
sexual encounters with Ms. Lewinsky in areas around the Oval Office
and provides a narrative of Clinton's prolonged efforts to impede
the independent counsel's inquiry and to persuade others to assist
in a conspiracy to ``hinder, impede and deflect'' investigations by
a federal grand jury and the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The report provides a seamy account of an illicit relationship
between the president of the United States and an unpaid
22-year-old intern and the lengths to which he went to conceal it
from his family, his staff and the public.
</P>
<P>
   It offered a wealth of new details, from the origin of Clinton's
decision to try to thwart Starr's inquiry, in a discussion with his
political adviser, Dick Morris, to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation's determination that a semen stain on a blue dress
belonging to Ms. Lewinsky came from the president. The odds of the
semen having come from someone other than Clinton, the FBI
reported, are 1 in nearly 8 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   The report asserts that Clinton decided upon a strategy of
stonewalling the Starr investigation the same day his relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky was made public, Jan. 21. That evening, Clinton
consulted Morris, who told him that an instant poll had shown that
the American people would be willing to forgive adultery, but not
perjury or obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Morris told the president that confessing the full details of
the affair was therefore not an option. According to Morris's grand
jury testimony, the president replied, ``Well, we just have to win,
then.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a tearful confessional at a White House prayer
breakfast Friday, acknowledged that he had ``sinned'' in his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and apologized for the first time to
her and her family. But he vowed a vigorous defense against Starr's
charges.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, in the first volley of its counterattack the
Starr report, issued a combative 78-page rebuttal this afternoon
even before officials had read the report.
</P>
<P>
   The response, written by David Kendall, the president's private
attorney, and White House Counsel Charles Ruff, said that the
independent counsel was trying to drive the president from office
for a sexual indiscretion for which he had already apologized. The
lawyers denied that Clinton had committed any of the other crimes
listed by the prosecutor and asserted that none of the president's
actions constituted impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers said Starr had ``dangerously overreached
to describe in the most dramatic of terms conduct that not only is
not criminal but is actually proper and lawful.''
</P>
<P>
   Their response admitted that Clinton had given incomplete and
misleading answers in a deposition in the Paula Jones lawsuit in
January and again before a federal grand jury in August. But they
denied that those statements constituted perjury.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Starr report's strongest sections describe the sexual
activity between Ms. Lewinsky and Clinton and Clinton's repeated
misrepresentations about it under oath. The document's authors said
Clinton's evasiveness before the federal grand jury forced them to
include the salacious details about the sexual encounters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first two possible grounds for impeachment concern the
president's lying under oath about the nature of his relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky,'' the report stated. ``The details associated
with those grounds are, by their nature, explicit. The president's
testimony unfortunately has rendered the details essential with
respect to those two grounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors gave great weight to Ms. Lewinsky's accounts of
her sexual activities with the president. While the president has
admitted engaging in some forms of sexual conduct, he specifically
denied other forms. It was those statements that are the basis of
allegations of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors gave great weight to Ms. Lewinsky's accounts of
her sexual activities with the president. While the president has
admitted to some forms of sexual conduct with her, he specifically
denied other forms. Those statements are the basis of the
allegations of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   In their response, Clinton's lawyers said that answers to
ambiguous questions can never be perjury. And, they said, ``nobody
can be convicted of perjury based on only one other person's
testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   The report accuses the president and Ms. Lewinsky of agreeing to
concoct ``cover stories'' to keep their relationship a secret.
</P>
<P>
   During a March 29, 1997, sexual encounter with Ms. Lewinsky, the
president told her that ``he suspected that a foreign embassy (he
did not specify which one) was tapping his telephones, and he
proposed cover stories. If ever questioned, she should say that the
two of them were just friends. If anyone ever asked about their
phone sex, she should say that they knew their calls were being
monitored all along, and the phone sex was just a put-on,''
according to Ms. Lewinsky's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The president denied her account in his grand jury testimony.
The prosecutors wrote that Ms. Lewinsky's account was corroborated
by contemporaneous discussions she had with 11 people, including
eight friends, two psychological counselors and her mother, Marcia
Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Sections alleging abuse of power and witness tampering appear
less conclusive. The single accusation of witness tampering arose
from discussions Clinton had with his personal secretary, Betty
Currie, immediately after his deposition in the Paula Jones
lawsuit. Prosecutors believe that Clinton tried to influence her
testimony with a series of leading questions, but Mrs. Currie's
testimony on several key points was ambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   The Starr report also accused the president of abusing his
office by lying repeatedly to the public and in court proceedings.
The charge also includes the president's repeated refusal to
volunarily testify before the grand jury and his invocation of
executive privilege to block testimony by key aides. Clinton
ultimately testified after he was subpoenaed and the president's
privilege claims were denied by federal judges.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers rejected that argument, saying, ``If
allowing aides to repeat misleading statements is a crime, then any
number of public officials are guilty of misusing their office for
as long as they fail to admit wrongdoing in response to any
allegation about their activity.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The Starr report cited 11 specific possible grounds for
impeachment in four categories: Five counts of lying under oath,
four counts of obstruction of justice, one count of witness
tampering and one count of abuse of constitutional authority.
</P>
<P>
   The report, written by several assistants in Starr's office, is
methodical and exhaustive. When confronted by conflicting accounts,
it tends to accept the version most damaging to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``After being subpoenaed in July,'' the report says in one
summary passage describing what it called a pattern of perjury by
Clinton, ``the president made false statements to the grand jury on
Aug. 17, 1998. That night, the president again made false
statements to the American people and Congress, contending that his
answers in his civil deposition had been `legally accurate.' The
president then made an implicit plea for Congress to take no
action: `Our country has been distracted by this matter for too
long.'''
</P>
<P>
   The authors then place the blame squarely on the president for
the slow pace of the investigation. ``The president has pursued a
strategy of deceiving the American people and Congress in January
1998, delaying and impeding the criminal investigation for seven
months, and deceiving the American people and Congress again in
August 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps the most damaging portion of the report, Starr's
prosecutors say that Clinton lied under oath five times, both in
the Paula Jones deposition and in his grand jury testimony last
month, when he denied that he had had ``a sexual affair, a sexual
relationship or sexual relations'' with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But the report said that the president's response to lying under
oath rests on his own narrow definition of ``sexual relations'' _
``namely, that it requires sexual intercourse, no matter how
extensive the sexual activities might otherwise be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the president,'' the report says, ``a man could
regularly engage in oral sex and fondling of breasts and genitals
with a woman and yet not have a `sexual affair' with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky testified in much detail about ``substantial sexual
activity'' that she said she engaged in with Clinton, on 10
separate days in hallways, bathrooms and the president's private
study, from Nov. 15, 1995, to Dec. 28, 1997. She said that Clinton
made direct contact with her breasts and genitalia.
</P>
<P>
   To corroborate her statements, prosecutors point to her own
testimony, and statements she made to 11 people. They also quote a
draft letter, gleaned from Ms. Lewinsky's home computer, in which
Ms. Lewinsky describes an incident in her relationship with the
president where she refers to ``watching your mouth on my breast''
and refers imiplicity to direct contact with her genitalia.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky said that the president's ``hands-off policy''
suggests some kind of ``service contract _ that all I did was
perform oral sex on him and that that's all this relationship
was.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the grand jury, Clinton was denied that he had sexual
relations with Ms. Lewinsky ``and said, in effect, that Monica
Lewinsky was lying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You are free to infer that my testimony is that I did not have
sexual relations, as I understood this term to be defined,'' he
testifed before the grand jury from the White House on Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor asked, ``Including touching her breast, kissing
her breast, touching her genitalia?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's correct,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Friday, in two separate documents, there was a dispute
between the White House and Starr about fundamental facts of the
relationship. In its 78-page rebuttal, the White House wrote that
the relationship began in early 1996 and in one incident in early
1997. But in the report, Starr said that Ms. Lewinsky testified
that their intimate relationship began on Nov. 15, 1995, during the
Government shutdown when they engaged in oral sex while the
president spoke on the telephone with a congressman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The motive for the president to make a false statement about
the date on which the sexual relationship started appears to have
been that the president was unwilling to admit sexual activity with
a young 22-year-old White House intern in the Oval Office area.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr also accuses Clinton of lying under oath when he testified
he could not recall instances when he was alone with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, they said that Ms. Lewinsky testified that she was alone
on numerous occasions with the president inside the Oval Office,
the president's private study, the private bathroom across from the
study and the hallway that leads from the Oval Office to the
private dining room.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr's prosecutors have other witnesses who testified that
the president and Ms. Lewinsky were alone together, including Betty
Currie, the president's secretary, six Secret Service agents and a
White House steward, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   In the obstruction of justice portion of the report, prosecutors
say that Clinton took an active role in trying to hide his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky from the Jones lawyers and later
from Starr's investigators by concealing gifts they exchanged,
which had been subpoenaed.

SOUTHLAND LOTTO WINNERS PUT CONCERNS BEHIND THEM

<P>
   Los Angeles _ Overnight, Denise and George Leano of Lancaster no
longer have to worry about medical bills, broken-down cars and what
they can afford off a restaurant menu.
</P>
<P>
   The couple and their four children are newly minted
millionaires, the owners of the only winning ticket in Wednesday
night's $20 million Super Lotto jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things like that don't happen to regular people. I still feel
regular. I feel like I'm in a dream,'' said Denise Leano, 40, a
registered nurse who works in the critical care unit at Antelope
Valley Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   George Leano, 39, bought the winning ticket Wednesday evening at
a Lucky Food Center in Lancaster, after getting off work at High
Desert Hospital, where he works as a clerk in the business office.
</P>
<P>
   Buying tickets has been a twice-a-week routine for Leano since
the lottery started 13 years ago. He always spent no more than $5
and always told his wife they were going to win.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Leano, who considers herself the realistic one, reminded
him he needed to keep his day job.
</P>
<P>
   George Leano bought five tickets Wednesday, four on which he
marked his own numbers and one a quick pick. It was the quick pick
that won.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just was praising God. We were praying to get out of debt.
We are Christians and make do like everybody else. We just said
it's a miracle,'' said Denise Leano.
</P>
<P>
   The family has always struggled financially, and last year was
especially hard, she said. Both Leanos got sick and between them
were off work for almost a year.
</P>
<P>
   Leano said she plans to continue working, but not full time. She
said her husband also will stay on the job but probably will retire
eventually.
</P>
<P>
   The Leanos elected to receive 26 annual payments, rather than a
lump sum amount. The first payment before taxes will be $500,000,
the 26th, $1,020,000, said Cathy Doyle Johnston, a lotto
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate, the Leanos, their four children _ Sarah, 15;
George Jr., 13; Anthony, 11; and Alexander, 7 _ a sister and
brother-in-law and their child, and one set of grandparents went to
the Red Lobster restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We let everybody get anything and everything they wanted. We
usually do not do that, maybe for special occasions,'' said Leano.
``We ordered stuff like rich people eat, but we couldn't eat it
because we were nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   The tab was $318.
</P>
<P>
   The first big-ticket item the Leanos plan to buy is a custom
Chevrolet van. They plan to go to Disneyland, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can go to the doctor when they get sick. We are not going
to have to worry when the children need shoes. I'm just going to go
buy them,'' said Leano.

EDITORIAL: THE PRIMARY FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Sept. 12:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The race for the Democratic nomination for attorney
general seems to have been conducted well below the public's radar
screen, which is too bad. It is an important post, and New York has
seldom seen as good a group of candidates, with such strong
qualifications for the office they seek.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Koppell has already served as attorney general on an
appointive basis in 1993, following an impressive 23-year career
championing good government and environmental causes in the state
Assembly. Catherine Abate, a two-term state senator from Manhattan,
gained valuable managerial experience at the helm of several public
agencies, including a challenging two-year stint as New York City's
Corrections Commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Eliot Spitzer, a former New York City prosecutor who is spending
millions of his own money on the race, has shown himself to be a
tireless campaigner who would enliven the office with fresh energy
and ideas. Evan Davis, who was counsel to former Gov. Mario Cuomo,
has an impressive legal background that includes a prestigious
Supreme Court clerkship, work on the House Watergate inquiry and a
partnership in a large New York City law firm. The winner of the
primary on Sept. 15 will face the Republican incumbent, Dennis
Vacco, in November.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abate has a fine record of public service. But despite her
recent expression of regret, we remain troubled by the lack of
candor she showed when she took the job of corrections commissioner
without divulging that her father had been identified as an
organized crime figure by New Jersey law-enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   Davis deserves praise for limiting campaign contributions to
$2,500 and rejecting donations from corporations and other
special-interest groups. It is a bold step designed to highlight
the need for statewide campaign finance reform and to keep the
attorney general's office removed from political fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   But, in a close call, our endorsement goes to Koppell, another
longtime advocate of campaign reform, whose public service was
marked by a principled and intelligent approach to issues. We
believe he offers the most appealing mix of legal expertise,
managerial experience and the political skills required to mount an
effective fall campaign.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's lawyers argued Friday that
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's impeachment referral to
Congress was sprinkled with salacious and lurid details solely to
humiliate the president and drive him from office.
</P>
<P>
   In their 73-page response, couched in tones that are both
conversational and combative, the Clinton lawyers sought to portray
the president's behavior as a major personal failing for which he
has accepted responsibility but nothing serious enough to warrant
his impeachment and removal from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In comments to reporters Friday afternoon, David Kendall, the
president's personal lawyer, pressed the notion that Clinton's
sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky ``was not a new story''
but rather fit an age-old human pattern of illicit sex and
understandable efforts by both partners to conceal it from the rest
of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``In short this is personal, not impeachable,'' Kendall told
reporters gathered in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. The
report emphasized that the president has admitted that his sexual
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky was a serious error, but that,
``This private mistake does not amount to an impeachable action.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of what amounted to the first draft of the
president's defense brief before Congress and the nation is the
argument that impeachment should be reserved for the gravest of
crimes and that Starr has inflated Clinton's offenses to satisfy
his own political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   In the report, which was prepared even before the Clinton
lawyers were able to see Starr's 445-page referral to the House of
Representatives, the Clinton lawyers reached back into the history
of the Republic to argue that utilizing the Constitution's
impeachment clause was a wholly disproportionate response to the
president's misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton lawyers argued that the nation's founders believed _
and contemporary scholars agree _ that impeachment was designed as
the most serious form of sanction to be used only for ``the most
serious forms of wrongdoing.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also sought to dispute charges made by Starr that the
president committed perjury, tried to obstruct justice, tampered
with witnesses or abused the powers of his office in trying to
bolster his deception that he had not had an intimate relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   And in one section of the report rendered with anger, the
Clinton lawyers asked rhetorically: ``Where's Whitewater?''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers said that as evidence of Starr's motives he has not
formally exonerated the president or Mrs. Clinton even though the
prosecutor apparently has been unable to find any evidence of their
wrongdoing in the Whitewater land deal in Arkansas that was the
original issue to be investigated. The report also said that Starr
was evidently unable to come up with anything improper involving
the Clintons' behavior in his investigations of other matters,
including the dismissal of longtime employees at the White House
travel office and the acquisition by the White House of
investigative files of more than 900 people, some of them prominent
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means that the Office of Independent Counsel report is
left with nothing but the details of a private sexual relationship
told in graphic details with the intent to embarrass,'' the Clinton
lawyers argued.
</P>
<P>
   But the complexities of trying to knit the legal and political
strands of the president's case were evident in his lawyers'
exquisitely nuanced arguments as to why Clinton was not guilty of
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been expressing contrition on almost a daily basis
for the last few weeks, insisting that he has thoroughly come to
terms with his actions. At the same time, he continues to insist
that he was truthful when he told lawyers for Paula Jones that he
had not engaged in sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky. To do
otherwise could lend credence to a perjury charge, Clinton's
advisers have said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr devoted considerable portions of his report developing the
argument that Clinton committed perjury by lying in his Jan. 17,
1998, deposition to lawyers for Mrs. Jones who were trying to show
that Clinton had a pattern of engaging in sexually irresponsible
behavior. In response to a question, Clinton testified that he had
not engaged in sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In their extended explanation, Clinton's lawyers argued that his
answers were truthful because he did not engage in traditional
sexual intercourse. At the time of the Jones deposition, the trial
judge had approved a specific definition of sexual relations and
Clinton has asserted that he believed the definition covered
traditional intercourse but not, for example, oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president testified truthfully,'' Kendall said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, a statement must be false to lead to a perjury
charge. But a misleading answer may not constitute perjury.
</P>
<P>
   The argument advanced by Kendall and Charles F.C. Ruff, the
White House counsel and co-author of Friday's report, is that the
lawyers for Mrs. Jones did not press Clinton to answer further
questions.
</P>
<P>
   During the deposition, Clinton said he agreed with an affidavit
of Ms. Lewinsky asserting they had never engaged in a sexual
relationship. ``To the president, that term reasonably requires
sexual intercourse as a necessary component of the relationship,''
the Clinton report said. ``Since his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky
did not involve intercourse, he truthfully answered that the
affadavit was accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the lawyers argued that Clinton accurately denied
having a ``sexual affair'' with Ms. Lewinsky because he understood
that term to require traditional sexual intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall told reporters that the allegations about the details of
the sexual relationship were included in the Starr report for
political purposes only. ``The salacious allegations in this
referral are simply designed to humiliate, embarrass and
politically damage the president,'' he said.

 WASHINGTON: he said. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Starr's lawyers argued they were obliged to include so many
details about the actual sexual activities because Clinton
interpreted the definition of ``sexual relations'' in such a narrow
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Friday whether Clinton had invited the inclusion of those
details with that definition, Kendall repeated that Clinton had
answered all questions accurately, if not completely. The
inclusions of descriptions of specific sex acts, he said, ``exceeds
any legitimate justification.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall also laid the foundation for Clinton's defense against
obstruction of justice charges, denying that Clinton had urged
anyone to lie, but acknowledging that ``in all such wrongful,
improper relations there is concomitant concealment, by its very
nature.''
</P>
<P>
   In their rebuttal, Clinton's lawyers underlined that Starr
failed to show that Clinton or anyone in the White House helped
write the so-called ``talking points.'' Ms. Lewinsky testified that
she wrote these talking points on her own and gave them to her
onetime friend Linda Tripp, to alter Ms. Tripp's account of
Clinton's encounter with another woman in a way that would not hurt
the president.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton lawyers noted that the talking points were widely
described in press accounts as the linchpin of the Starr
investigation and, in fact, were used by Starr as a justification
for investigating the Lewinsky matter because they raised issues of
suborning perjury.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton report said of the talking points, ``in the fullness
of time, and after investigation, they have vanished entirely. Only
the stigma remains.''

MCCAUGHEY ROSS STEPS UP ATTACKS ON VALLONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the Democratic gubernatorial primary race entered its final
weekend, Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross stepped up her attacks on
her major rival, Peter Vallone, while he drew the cloak of labor
union support around him and tried to ignore the barrage.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCaughey Ross, who said less than a week ago that she would
not engage in negative campaigning, Friday began broadcasting new
radio advertisements _ featuring Patricia Ireland, the president of
the National Organization for Women _ that attack Vallone's record
on education and question his commitment to abortion rights. They
are the first attack ads by any of the candidates in this race.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Ms. McCaughey Ross said she had decided to go on the
offensive because ``Peter Vallone is making misleading claims about
his record, so it's my responsibility to help voters see the whole
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   The other primary candidates are the Brooklyn district attorney,
Charles Hynes, and James Larocca, a former state transportation
commissioner. Larocca made no public appearances Friday. Hynes
campaigned on Staten Island _ greeting commuters at the ferry
terminal and proposing a plan for disposing of toxic harbor
sediment _ as well as in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the chairwoman of the state Democratic Party, Judith
Hope, lashed out at Ms. McCaughey Ross.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her criticisms of Peter Vallone are way off base and ill
founded,'' she said. ``Peter Vallone has been an effective champion
of women's issues, including the toughest law against job and wage
discrimination in the country. I'm disappointed in her decision to
go negative in the final hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hope has urged Democratic candidates all year not to attack
each other, but she may also be hoping to protect the candidate now
seen as the favored candidate in Tuesday's primary. The winner will
face Gov. George Pataki, a Republican, in November.
</P>
<P>
   The lieutenant governor, the only woman in a field of four in
the primary, has made increasingly overt appeals to women in recent
weeks, often reminding audiences that she has three daughters.
Friday, she held a breakfast with a small group of professional
women, and on Saturday, she planned a bus tour around New York City
with Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the new Ms. McCaughey Ross ads, Ms. Ireland says,
``Peter Vallone can't be trusted to defend a woman's right to
choose.'' In the other, she says schoolchildren have paid for
Vallone's 25 years on the New York City Council ``with crumbling
schools and low reading scores.''
</P>
<P>
   At a campaign appearance outside City Hall Friday, Vallone
repeated his support for abortion rights and said, ``No one has
done more for our schools than I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Vallone's campaign also produced testimonials from several
prominent women in defense of his record on abortion, including
Kelli Conlin, executive director of the New York Chapter of the
National Abortion Rights Action League.
</P>
<P>
   And campaign aides have been aggressive about reminding
reporters that the City Council held little power until 1990, and
still has no role in the operation of the school system or the
selection of the Board of Education or the chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to explain the abortion attacks, Ms. Ireland and Ms.
McCaughey Ross cited Vallone's support of a law that requires that
before a girl under age 18 can have an abortion, an adult guardian,
family member or not, must be notified. They also contend that the
1993 law the Council passed to outlaw blocking access to family
planning clinics was not strong enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're talking about gradations here; I think he is
wishy-washy,'' Ms. Ireland conceded in an interview. ``It's not as
though he hasn't done some good things.''

EDITORIAL: A FLAWED ACHIEVEMENT IN BOSNIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Sept. 12:
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton peace agreements nearly three years ago ended the
savage killing in Bosnia. That was a proud achievement, but Dayton
promised more than just a respite from violence. The United States
and its European partners set out to promote a multiethnic
democracy in Bosnia that could become a reliable foundation for
lasting peace. As Bosnia's second round of postwar elections unfold
this weekend, the results of that effort look disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   With international supervisors watching every contest, there is
unlikely to be gross fraud or serious procedural irregularities.
But the internationally approved electoral rules do too little to
encourage candidates and voters to reach beyond their ethnic
communities and build broader coalitions. As a result, the
elections are likely to maintain the grip of divisive parties and
politicians over all three of Bosnia's ethnic communities _ Serb,
Croat and Muslim. Some of the most virulent fanatics have been
driven to the sidelines. But many favored candidates, especially in
Serbian and Croatian areas, espouse the same kind of narrow,
nationalist politics that led to war. Many also oppose the Dayton
agreement's provisions for letting refugees return to their
original homes.
</P>
<P>
   On the military side, the Americans and Europeans have done
fairly well. The original contingent of 60,000 NATO troops is now
down to 32,000, about 8,000 of them Americans. Although the absence
of a clear exit strategy has caused withdrawal deadlines to slip,
NATO has separated and partially disarmed the warring forces with
minimal casualties and without expanding its mission.
</P>
<P>
   But civilian reconstruction has gone less well, and both the
Europeans and Americans are at fault. Local politicians, for
example, have been allowed to control the distribution of aid,
encouraging corruption, discouraging self-help and reinforcing
ethnic parties. Meanwhile, the people in charge of organizing the
elections, mainly Americans, have preferred to work with
cooperative incumbents rather than press for the kind of electoral
system used in places like Northern Ireland to encourage
cooperation among different ethnic groups. Such rules should be
adopted before Bosnia's next elections.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has also taken other dangerous short cuts. Last year,
the Clinton administration approved the use of military force to
drive ultranationalist broadcasters from the airwaves. A better
approach, and more consistent with free speech values, would be to
adopt more effective programs to help independent local media
compete for audience attention.
</P>
<P>
   The true measure of progress in Bosnia will be the development
of institutions that allow Bosnians to heal themselves, making
peacekeepers, monitors and aid unnecessary.

LESSONS OF CLINTON SCANDAL ON THE MINDS OF CHILDREN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY HEESUN WEE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There was a time not long ago when an ambitious
child's ultimate dream was to grow up to be president.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, that lofty post took a nasty tumble in the eyes of
some American children.
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton asked forgiveness from everyone at a White
House prayer breakfast on the dawn of the release of Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr's report, children watched with
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not consider him as a role model,'' said Justin Wolpe,
a sixth-grader at Francis Parkman Middle School in Woodland Hills,
a Los Angeles suburb.
</P>
<P>
   And so the sentiments echoed through the halls of schools across
Los Angeles on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Educators at Parkman used the details of Starr's report to
jump-start timely discussions about personal morality, public vs.
private lives and the consequences of lying.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in his morning speech, Clinton himself focused the
nation on the importance of integrity, a lesson he addressed to
America's children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children of this country can learn in a profound way that
integrity is important and selfishness is wrong, but God can change
us and make us strong at the broken places. I want to embody those
lessons for the children of this country _ for that little boy in
Florida who came up to me and said that he wanted to grow up and be
president and to be just like me. I want the parents of all the
children in America to be able to say that to their children.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority of pupils enrolled in Parkman's Peace Institute, a
program that melds traditional academic topics with news
discussions, said they wished the whole affair would just go away.
It's a personal issue and it should be dropped, they tended to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean to bad-mouth the American people, but the reason
this has gone so far is that people want to read about it,'' said
Alana Purcell.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people want to stop having their taxes going to that, let
it go,'' said Flor Nunez.
</P>
<P>
   A few even attacked the media for giving overzealous play to the
story.
</P>
<P>
   ```I did not have sexual relations with that woman.' (Television
stations) always are repeating that to get us mad,'' said Daniel
Chernobelsky.
</P>
<P>
   For some children, the media spotlight on the president's
personal relations with a White House intern has dulled the luster
of becoming involved in American politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's a totally different thing. Someone always would be
checking you,'' said Nunez.
</P>
<P>
   Once the dust settles, educators say, they hope the most
important lesson youngsters glean from Clinton is a timeless moral
one: Don't lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just tell us the truth,'' said the school's principal, Michael
Bennett, at an assembly for 350 sixth-graders early Friday morning.
He specifically addressed Clinton's possible impeachment in his
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't try to hem and haw. It will be a lot easier, because we
can work with you. ... Look at what it cost this man who has got
the most important job in the world,'' said Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take it back to you,'' said Peace Institute teacher Carol
Lache. ``Is lying a good thing to do?'' &QL;

EDITORIAL: SHAME AT THE WHITE HOUSE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Sept. 12:
</P>
<P>
   Until it was measured by Kenneth Starr, no citizen _ indeed,
perhaps no member of his own family _ could have grasped the
completeness of President Clinton's mendacity or the magnitude of
his recklessness. Whatever the outcome of the resignation and
impeachment debates, the independent counsel report by Starr is
devastating in one respect, and its historic mark will be
permanent. A president who had hoped to be remembered for the
grandeur of his social legislation will instead be remembered for
the tawdriness of his tastes and conduct and for the disrespect
with which he treated a dwelling that is a revered symbol of
presidential dignity.
</P>
<P>
   By using that great house for sad little trysts with a
desperately star-struck employee, by skulking around within sight
of nervous Secret Service agents, by conducting erotic telephone
games while traveling without his wife, Clinton has produced a
crisis of surreal complexity. The crisis will have to be resolved
at the imprecise point where legal and constitutional principles
intersect with controlling political reality. A president without
public respect or congressional support cannot last.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether Bill Clinton will last will be settled
according to two processes. One will play out in the collective
judgment of the American people, as the astonishing details of
Clinton's inventive style of adultery ripple through the public
consciousness. The other will play out in Congress, where Starr's
strict theory of what constitutes perjury will collide with the
implausibly permissive interpretations of Clinton's lawyer, David
Kendall.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of Starr's case is that lying under oath is an
impeachable offense even if the false testimony begins in a civil
suit that was later dismissed or took place in a grand jury as an
attempt to hide an embarrassing indiscretion. Starr's view holds
that in a society founded on the rule of law, false swearing or
witness tampering, abuse of office or obstruction of justice by the
person vested with the highest legal powers is impermissible no
matter how petty the subject.
</P>
<P>
   This page has long held a similar view of the sanctity of law,
but we grant that the magnitude, complexity and, yes, the oddness
of this case require deep deliberation. The allegations of the
Starr report, even though intricately documented and even though
Clinton has admitted to some of the main points, must be tested
thoroughly. Moreover, Congress must reach a judgment about Starr's
argument that presidential perjury or obstruction of justice in any
context rises to the level of constitutional punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The White House argues that Clinton's ``private mistake does not
amount to an impeachable action'' and that in referring to the
``high crimes and misdemeanors'' that could remove a president, the
framers of the Constitution ``meant wrongs committed against our
system of government.'' Kendall does this argument no service,
however, when he insults the nation's intelligence by insisting
that the president did not lie when he denied having sex with
Monica Lewinsky during his deposition in the Paula Jones suit and,
more seriously, repeated that denial before the grand jury itself
on Aug. 17. In framing the question in the Jones case, Clinton's
interrogators specified exactly the kinds of intimate activity that
Ms. Lewinsky described under oath. By relying on this kind of
destructive legal counsel from Kendall for so long, Clinton has
managed to create one of the most disastrous personal situations in
the history of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   He attempted to repair the damage Friday at the White House
prayer breakfast with his most aggressive speech of contrition.
With its unmitigated confession, its declaration of repentance, its
forthright apology to Ms. Lewinsky, this was a striking speech. But
its most striking feature was its lateness. The same words
delivered in January, when he lied, or on Aug. 17, when he
equivocated and hurled blame, might have lifted Clinton on to a
road of guaranteed survival. He has no such guarantee today. He and
we must await not only the adjudication of Congress, but the even
more potent process of public deliberation. The determinative
public opinion will coalesce over the next few days, and it will
probably catapult ahead of and drive congressional action.
</P>
<P>
   As if to gird himself to endure this process, Clinton told the
prayer breakfast that he had achieved the ``broken spirit'' cited
in Psalms as a prerequisite of redemption. The phrase occurs in
Proverbs 17:22, as well, in a way that fits the capital's mood. ``A
merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth
the bones.'' Merriness has long been in short supply in Bill
Clinton's Washington, largely because that most sovereign of
political medicines, the truth, has been so rare for so long. Truth
is on the loose now, spinning rampantly, and where it will lead is
beyond the arts of prediction.

AFTER JUST MISSING PLAYOFFS, LIBERTY DISMISSES ITS COACH 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three weeks after the Liberty lost its last
regular-season game and thus failed to make the Women's National
Basketball Association playoffs, its coach paid the price. Despite
winning records of 17-11 and 18-12 in the league's two seasons, the
Liberty dismissed Nancy Darsch on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Blazejowski, the team's vice president and general
manager, said in a conference call: ``Our goal is to win the WNBA
championship. It was very disappointing this year not even to reach
the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Had the Liberty done that, would Darsch have lost her job? ``I
don't know how that would factor in,'' Blazejowski said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the decision reflected the two-year performance of the
team and its coach, not just one game. She did not get into
specifics, but the team sometimes looked disorganized, and starters
often spent long stretches on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Down the stretch, the Liberty's 6-foot-4-inch marquee player,
Rebecca Lobo, became a dominant rebounder. Teresa Weatherspoon also
played well, but Sophia Witherspoon, Vickie Johnson and Kym Hampton
had up-and-down seasons.
</P>
<P>
   When the WNBA was formed, the Liberty approached such college
coaches as Geno Auriemma of Connecticut and Jim Foster of
Vanderbilt. None seemed interested in a job that lacked long-term
security. Darsch was interested, having just lost her job at Ohio
State after a 3-13 season in the Big Ten.
</P>
<P>
   Blazejowski said there was no timetable to name a new coach. She
added: ``I think many high-profile coaches would consider the job.
I think it's a different climate now. We didn't know what we were
in for then. I think potential candidates are going to have an
entirely different perspective now.''
</P>
<P>
   One name sure to come up is Tennessee Coach Pat Summitt. The
Liberty, like every other WNBA and American Basketball League team,
wants Chamique Holdsclaw, the Queens native and player of the year
who is starting her senior season at Tennessee. A Summitt-Holdsclaw
package would be attractive, but Summitt seems unlikely to abandon
her job, which pays more than $500,000 a year.

ATTORNEY GENERAL CANDIDATES STILL STRUGGLE FOR ATTENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With only days before the primary, the four
Democratic candidates for New York state attorney general are
blanketing towns and cities with letters and fliers, jamming the
airwaves with television and radio advertisements and traveling the
state in a last-ditch effort to draw attention to a race that has
drawn little of it so far.
</P>
<P>
   But one public-opinion poll after another has shown that large
numbers of voters have yet to take notice of the race and are
undecided about which candidate they will support in Tuesday's
primary. That has the four Democratic candidates struggling not
only to attract attention but also to stand out in a race in which
there are few differences in ideology or in the way they say they
would carry out the job of attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is running as the flaming liberal of the party, nor is
anyone running as the party's centrist,'' said John Zogby, a
pollster who heads the John Zogby Group of Utica, N.Y. ``So when
everybody is saying the same thing from essentially the same place,
it greatly reduces passion for one side or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that all things are equal among the
candidates, who are Eliot Spitzer, a wealthy Manhattan lawyer and
former prosecutor; Catherine Abate, a state senator from Manhattan;
G. Oliver Koppell, a former attorney general; and Evan Davis, who
was a counsel to Gov. Mario Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer has used his vast personal wealth for an advertising
campaign that has won him the name recognition that the other
candidates sorely lack and do not have enough money to buy.
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that there have been clashes among the candidates,
they have centered on Spitzer and his money. The three other
candidates say he is using money from his father, a real estate
developer, to buy the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Eliot comes on the air with more than $4 million worth of
television advertising _ sure, it's an obstacle,'' Davis said the
other day on an Albany radio talk show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping they are going to see that this television is not
the way to evaluate the candidate,'' Davis said of the voters.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer has shrugged off the attacks as absurd. He has said that
using his own money to finance his campaign means that he is
beholden to no one. And he has also argued _ and most political
experts agree _ that it will take a well-financed campaign to
unseat the Republican incumbent, Dennis Vacco, who has a formidable
campaign war chest.
</P>
<P>
   That fight aside, each of the candidates is, by and large,
roaming the state this final weekend in a frantic push to pick up
endorsements from prominent politicians and groups and to persuade
voters they have the best credentials to be the state's top
law-enforcement officer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Spitzer's case, he has managed to get the backing of some
important Democratic leaders, many of whom have received political
contributions from him. Among Spitzer's supporters are the county
chairmen of Erie and Westchester counties, as well as the mayors of
Albany and Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's pitch on the stump is simple: his years of experience
in the courtroom make him the most suited to defend the people of
New York. He has focused on an array of popular issues, from
forcing corporate polluters to clean up the Hudson River to using
product liability laws to force gun manufacturers to install safety
locks on their products.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abate is shoring up support among influential labor unions,
women's groups, gay organizations and other historically Democratic
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   In her ads and speeches, she continues to point to her
experience at running large agencies _ including the New York City
probation and corrections departments _ as evidence that she can
run an office as large as the attorney general's. And she has
spoken passionately about issues affecting middle-class families,
from child care to health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a wife, mother and New York's attorney general, I'll
protect our families' health and economic well-being,'' Ms. Abate
says in a 30-second television advertisement that began running
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Koppell was selected by the state Legislature in 1993 to
complete the unexpired term of Robert Abrams, who resigned to run
for the U.S. Senate, but Koppell was defeated in his bid for a full
term in office. He has been asking voters to look at his
accomplishments during the time he was attorney general, from
cracking down on consumer fraud to suing corporate polluters.
Koppell, who also represented the Bronx in the state Assembly for
23 years, has all but locked up support from political leaders in
that borough, as well as his former Assembly colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Davis remains the outsider. His only prominent supporter is his
former boss, Cuomo, who is now being featured in radio ads urging
people to support Davis. Nevertheless, Davis is trying to
capitalize on his outsider status, casting himself as the
anti-establishment candidate and traveling to poor urban
neighborhoods with his message.
</P>
<P>
   He is the only candidate who has placed voluntary limits on his
own fund-raising and has also refused to take money from unions,
corporations and political action committees. He says that makes
him the only candidate who is not beholden to special interests.

ISLANDERS START SEARCH FOR TEMPORARY HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that the New York Islanders have vacated Nassau Coliseum
because of safety concerns, the team must balance its search for
new ``home'' ice with a concern over how far fans would have to
trek to attend games.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials are examining the availability of Madison Square
Garden, Continental Arena in East Rutherford, N.J., , the Hartford
(Conn.) Civic Center and the Spectrum in Philadelphia, but planning
to use any of those arenas will be difficult because the start of
the National Hockey League season is so close.
</P>
<P>
   The first of two home exhibition games is scheduled for Sept.
25. The first regular-season game is Oct. 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders know that moving games from Nassau Coliseum will
test the loyalty and gas tanks of their fans, especially
season-ticket holders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've thought about the fans a lot, but until we know where
we're going to play, we haven't figured out how to minimize
disruptions,'' said David Seldin, the Islanders' president. ``We
have a month. It's not a lot of time, but it's not tomorrow. We
don't have to do everything at once.''
</P>
<P>
   The team may have to play in two arenas if a settlement of
maintenance and safety disputes cannot be reached with SMG, which
runs Nassau Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The Hartford arena, which the Garden runs, is host to the
Wolfpack, a minor league hockey team, as well as University of
Connecticut college basketball games and other events. It has more
open dates than the Garden or Continental Arena, but is a greater
distance away.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Spectrum is no longer home to the Flyers or 76ers,
it is busy. The schedules at the Garden and Continental Arena are
packed with Knicks, Rangers, Nets and Devils games, plus other
events.
</P>
<P>
   Islanders co-owner Howard Milstein has held two conversations
with Charles Dolan, chairman of Cablevision Systems, the Garden's
owner, about sharing the ice with the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of the National Basketball Association lockout
continuing into the regular season, which is scheduled to begin in
early November, does not open arena doors wide to the Islanders.
The NBA will hold all dates as long as possible until it is certain
the games cannot be played, said Brian McIntyre, a league
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I'd do everything I can to help them,'' said John
McMullen, the owner of the Devils, who said he would waive his
hockey exclusivity at Continental Arena to accommodate some
Islanders games.
</P>
<P>
   John Samerjan, a spokesman for the New Jersey Sports and
Exposition Authority, which runs Continental Arena, said that after
reviewing the scheduling implications of adding Islanders games,
``We may look to accommodate some dates, if feasible, if it is a
need for the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, a day after filing suit against SMG in federal court,
the team moved its furniture, files and memorabilia in a convoy of
vans to temporary offices in Manhattan. It was the most dramatic
gesture by the team in its feud with SMG.
</P>
<P>
   The team also wants a new arena, but no financing plan is in
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've warned people since August that one of the consequences
of the safety problems not being handled is we'd have to do
something like this,'' Seldin said.
</P>
<P>
   NHL commissioner Gary Bettman is involved in trying to help the
Islanders find a temporary home and resolve the legal dispute with
SMG. He could forge a compromise that would get SMG to make the
necessary repairs that would keep the Islanders from becoming
nomads.

ABOUT NEW YORK: HARD FALL PRECEDES RUN IN THE BRONX 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A year and a half ago, Cynthia English's only home
was the streets and subways of Brooklyn. The breakup of her 15-year
marriage sent her into a depression that cost her job, apartment
and two children. When she had money, she had friends. She ate at
soup kitchens, and slept in doorways or flopped at the home of a
prostitute for whom she was sometimes a lookout. One night, despair
was her sole possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did something I have never done before or since,'' she
recalled. ``It was a means of survival that involved another human
being. After it was over, I couldn't reconcile myself with the fact
I had done this thing. I decided I was going to walk until I die.''
</P>
<P>
   Luck or fate landed her in a Bronx homeless shelter, where she
rebuilt her life, becoming an advocate for the homeless and welfare
recipients. She found a job and a new apartment, and regained
custody of her children. Her walking days are over _ now she wants
to run. On Tuesday, her name will be on the ballot for district
leader in the Bronx's 79th Assembly District.
</P>
<P>
   She says she can empathize with how undone life can become for
the least fortunate in her district. She also thinks her hard
knocks have given her an understanding of the social issues that
some politicians have reduced to abstractions in budget debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our government is supposed to be by the people and for the
people,'' said Ms. English, 34. ``But most of the people in
government and politics don't really have any idea of what it's
like to really be without.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing she never lacked was responsibility. She recounted a
life in which she was sent to a boarding school, worked since she
was 10 and went to college. She was working for a home care agency
two years ago when her marriage fell apart. She took up with a
boyfriend, but things got worse. He broke her jaw.
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing depression left her unable to eat or hold her
temper. She sent her children to live with a relative, but things
only unraveled. Her decision to walk herself to death on the
streets of Brooklyn soon became a journey of discovery. She
regained her health in a hospital and later was sent to a shelter
where she became a volunteer lobbyist and speaker on the issues of
welfare reform and homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   On one of her lobbying visits, Ms. English met Assemblywoman
Gloria Davis, a Bronx Democrat who was impressed with her. Ms.
Davis, who herself was once on welfare and had been a victim of
domestic violence, saw in Ms. English someone who was helping
others despite her own predicament. The politician helped her get a
job with a social service group, and later found her an apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this summer, when Ms. Davis was looking for someone to
run on her slate as district leader, she again thought of Ms.
English. She saw Ms. English as the kind of person a politician
needed to deal with the issues that matter most at the grass roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, as legislators or district leaders, we are social workers
when you think about it,'' Ms. Davis said. ``We sit and pass
legislation. But when we come back to the local office, it's about
Miss Jones or Miss Rivera needs papers filled out, or you need to
call Con Ed or housing. You do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. English sees her own recent life as one in which she used
the skills she had to change a bad situation. Others, she said,
need to develop the skills she already had from her career and
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ever talking about the system giving us anything
except the opportunity to improve ourselves, so we can break the
cycle and elevate ourselves,'' she said. ``I just don't hold
people's hands and do everything for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, she said, the arguments over welfare and the homeless have
not paid enough attention to how people get those skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cleaning up parks and sweeping government buildings does not
qualify you for any kind of life-sustaining gainful employment,''
she said. ``It's all about the bottom line. It's not about people
or making New York a beautiful city by elevating people out of
poverty. It's about money. New York becomes the most beautiful city
in the world by getting rid of poor people. Where they want to send
us, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   A few nights ago she went to Concourse Village to campaign for
her slate. As she cheerfully handed out her literature, a guard
came over and told her she had to leave the complex, which was
private property. She left and stood on the sidewalk. Once again,
she was on the street. But this time, she was also on the ballot.

FOX EXEC'S ROSE-COLORED GLASS ARE FOGGED
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Peter Chernin, right-hand man to Rupert Murdoch,
catches as many Los Angeles Dodgers games as he can, maybe three a
week when he and the team are in town. He sits not in the
ivory-tower owner's box but in the stands behind the dugout and he
hears what the customers are saying.
</P>
<P>
   Chernin listens to sports-talk radio and reads the letters to
the sports editor. So he ought to know what Dodgers fans are
thinking as the first season under Fox Group ownership winds down,
down, down.
</P>
<P>
   Does he?
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers fans, you be the judge.

   He thinks you've been ``extremely supportive'' of the new

   He thinks you realize the Dodgers would be wild-card playoff
contenders, if not actual championship contenders, but for the
impact of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks you believe the ``long term'' is what's important and
that the club is better fixed in that regard now than it was before
the turmoil of spring and summer.
</P>
<P>
   And he thinks replacing Dodger Stadium is a bitter pill we might
all have to swallow if a new ballpark with all the money-making
amenities would help the ``economically disadvantaged'' club afford
its ``primary obligation'' _ winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love the place,'' he said on that last point, but his
reassurances are not reassuring. ``We're struggling a little bit
with some of the economic issues. Hopefully we can find a way to
make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Chernin is a smart man, a captain of the movie industry,
earnest and personable as he chats in the Stadium Club following
the introduction of Kevin Malone as the Dodgers' new general
manager Friday afternoon. He doesn't seem like the sort of
executive prone to self-deception.
</P>
<P>
   So it must be that he's afflicted with selective hearing loss
and his little Hollywood eyeglasses need cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   Because Chernin's account of what he hears and reads _ and maybe
he's speaking for Murdoch and left-hand man Chase Carey, too _
underestimates the challenge Fox faces in trying to repair public
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are astride the .500 mark, as secure in their seat
as a rag doll on a bucking bronco, and I haven't met a fan who
thinks they're closer to championship caliber now than they were
when Fox took over in February, promising stability before
dispatching Mike Piazza, Paul Konerko, Bill Russell, Fred Claire
and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it's a frustrating season,'' Chernin said. ``On the
other hand, we bought this for the long term. You can't assume
things are going to go right at the beginning. I think they (the
Dodgers front office) have tried really hard, and think more than
anything they've been affected by injuries. I feel pretty good
about most of the moves that were made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope more than anything the fans feel like the team is
trying, that there was never a time when the organization wasn't
trying to move forward. And that's what I feel like, that we were
trying to make improvements and get new players and, though I don't
know if we would have won the division, I think we would have been
in contention for a wild card if we didn't have all those
injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I actually feel that the fans _ and maybe this is
wishful thinking _ have been extremely supportive, that the
majority of the fans are supportive of the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   And: ``I think the fans have been very supportive (during)
what's been a disappointing year for everybody, because they at
least recognize we've done everything we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Regrets? ``I regret we're 17 games out of first place today.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe today it starts to turn around.
</P>
<P>
   The replacing of ``interim'' general manager Tom Lasorda with
Malone, the first Dodgers GM from outside the fold since Branch
Rickey in the 1940s, is an example of the new management machine
working well. Malone, 41, proved he's a franchise builder in the
same job with the Montreal Expos, and is a sharp talent evaluator
who honed his instincts as an Angels scout while living in the San
Fernando Valley in the mid-'80s.
</P>
<P>
   Malone wants to rebuild the Dodgers' tradition from the farm
level up, and expresses ``love'' for the old idea of Dodgers
``family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's still that way,'' Malone said. ``I guess
I'll find out in the next few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing's for sure, it isn't the O'Malley family anymore.
</P>
<P>
   At the June press conference to introduce Lasorda and manager
Glenn Hoffman, neither Chernin nor Carey attended and former owner
Peter O'Malley spoke as much as club president Bob Graziano.
O'Malley was there to provide benediction and soothe the
traditionalists.
</P>
<P>
   At Friday's press conference, Chernin sat alongside Malone,
Lasorda, Graziano, and O'Malley _ and everybody spoke except
O'Malley.
</P>
<P>
   It's the Fox family now without apology. Peter Chernin evidently
believes Fox's word is good enough for the fans.
</P>
<P>
   Is it?
</P>
<P>
   You be the judge.

 MARCO RIZO, 78, CUBAN PIANIST AND COMPOSER FOR `I LOVE LUCY' 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PETER WATROUS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Marco Rizo, a Cuban pianist best known for composing
for the ``I Love Lucy'' show, died on Tuesday at St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was a heart attack, said a friend, David
Younger.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rizo was known for his work with Desi Arnaz, he spent
much of his career immersed in classical music. As a pianist _ he
recorded some 30 albums _ he had a light, sure touch, and his
playing combined the technique of classical music with the
syncopation of the Afro-Cuban tradition and the swing of jazz.
Equally at ease in all three worlds, Rizo, a child prodigy, summed
up some of the possibilities of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Rizo was born in Santiago de Cuba and received his early musical
training from his father, who was the principal flutist with the
Santiago Symphony Orchestra and ran the Rizo-Ayala Jazz Band.
</P>
<P>
   Rizo continued studying classical music, and by the time he was
16 he was Santiago's most important concert pianist, with early
recitals including the music of Mozart, Chopin, Scriabin, and
Villa-Lobos, along with the classical Cuban composers Manuel
Saumell and Ignacio Cervantes.
</P>
<P>
   Working with his father's jazz band led him to explore jazz
orchestration. He moved to Havana, performing duets with the
composer and pianist Ernest Lecuona, and played under the direction
of visiting conductors like Leopold Stokowski and Erich Kleiber. In
1940 Rizo received a scholarship to Juilliard, where he studied
under Rosina Lhevinne. A stint in the Army during World War II had
him performing and orchestrating with the 2nd Army Military Band.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Desi Arnaz, whom Rizo had known since childhood,
invited Rizo to join the Desi Arnaz Orchestra as a pianist and
orchestrator, and until 1950 he toured the United States with the
band. He became the pianist and orchestrator for the ``I Love
Lucy'' show, which made its debut in 1951, and remained with the
show until 1959.
</P>
<P>
   During that time Rizo attended UCLA, studying under Igor
Stravinsky and Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco. He scored motion picture
music for Columbia, Paramount and MGM studios.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960 Rizo took a job as a staff orchestrator for CBS and
started a concert career, playing the music of Ernesto Lecuona and
other Cuban composers. All the while he kept on composing; his
piano and orchestral compositions include ``Suite Campesina,''
``Suite Espanola,'' ``Nanigo'' and ``Danzas Cubanas.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1989 Rizo was awarded the Silver Medal of the French Academy
of the Arts, Sciences and Letters in Paris. He recently completed
his latest CD, ``Habaneras,'' tracing the history of Cuban
classical piano.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a son, Mark, of Atlanta.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth Starr,
built his case for impeachment of President Clinton on an avalanche
of salacious details of the president's affair with Monica Lewinsky
and the Nixon-era concept of abuse of presidential power in using
government aides to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   In a scathing report which the House of Representatives
published to the world Friday, he said the president violated his
oath of office with repeated acts of perjury and obstruction of
justice. He also described in intimate detail Ms. Lewinsky's
account of her many meetings with the president, including 10
sexual encounters.
</P>
<P>
   The House must now judge whether Starr has presented a
compelling case for the impeachment of the president. There is so
much material in the report about his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky, and so much contradictory testimony from the president
and his defenders, that it will take weeks to gauge the power of
the case Starr has built against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The White House angrily responded that the Starr report was a
lurid and politically motivated attempt ``intended to humiliate the
president and force him from office.'' Clinton's lawyers said that
Starr and his team of prosecutors had, after four years of intense
investigative labor, found ``personal, not impeachable'' misconduct
by the president.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Starr's relentlessly accusatory 445-page report
riveted Washington and permanently changed the terms of the debate
over Clinton's fitness for office. Friday, some members of Congress
reacted with outrage, and some with revulsion, at the report's
torrent of embarrassing details about Clinton's sexual relationship
with a woman less than half his age just outside the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   The House, which authorized the release of the report on an
overwhelming bipartisan vote Friday afternoon, will soon begin
deliberations that could lead to the second presidential
impeachment hearings of the century.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 counts of possible impeachable offenses against Clinton _
all of which arose from his liaison with Ms. Lewinsky and not from
Whitewater and other matters Starr has investigated _ echo two of
the articles of impeachment voted against President Richard M.
Nixon in 1974. Nixon was found by the House Judiciary Committee to
have obstructed justice and abused the power of his office in
trying to cover up the Watergate break-in and related offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The report contains allegations of crimes for which Clinton
could face criminal prosecution if he leaves office through
resignation or impeachment. Some prosecutors in Starr's office want
to keep the federal grand jury here in operation for another year
to indict him.
</P>
<P>
   The document describes in graphic detail several of Clinton's
sexual encounters with Ms. Lewinsky in areas around the Oval Office
and provides a narrative of Clinton's prolonged efforts to impede
the independent counsel's inquiry and to persuade others to assist
in a conspiracy to ``hinder, impede and deflect'' investigations by
a federal grand jury and the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The report provides a seamy account of an illicit relationship
between the president of the United States and an unpaid
22-year-old intern and the lengths to which he went to conceal it
from his family, his staff and the public.
</P>
<P>
   It offered a wealth of new details, from the origin of Clinton's
decision to try to thwart Starr's inquiry, in a discussion with his
political adviser, Dick Morris, to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation's determination that a semen stain on a blue dress
belonging to Ms. Lewinsky came from the president. The odds of the
semen having come from someone other than Clinton, the FBI
reported, are 1 in nearly 8 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   The report asserts that Clinton decided upon a strategy of
stonewalling the Starr investigation the same day his relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky was made public, Jan. 21. That evening, Clinton
consulted Morris, who told him that an instant poll had shown that
the American people would be willing to forgive adultery, but not
perjury or obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Morris told the president that confessing the full details of
the affair was therefore not an option. According to Morris's grand
jury testimony, the president replied, ``Well, we just have to win,
then.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a tearful confessional at a White House prayer
breakfast Friday, acknowledged that he had ``sinned'' in his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and apologized for the first time to
her and her family. But he vowed a vigorous defense against Starr's
charges.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, in the first volley of its counterattack the
Starr report, issued a combative 78-page rebuttal this afternoon
even before officials had read the report.
</P>
<P>
   The response, written by David Kendall, the president's private
attorney, and White House Counsel Charles Ruff, said that the
independent counsel was trying to drive the president from office
for a sexual indiscretion for which he had already apologized. The
lawyers denied that Clinton had committed any of the other crimes
listed by the prosecutor and asserted that none of the president's
actions constituted impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers said Starr had ``dangerously overreached
to describe in the most dramatic of terms conduct that not only is
not criminal but is actually proper and lawful.''
</P>
<P>
   Their response admitted that Clinton had given incomplete and
misleading answers in a deposition in the Paula Jones lawsuit in
January and again before a federal grand jury in August. But they
denied that those statements constituted perjury.

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Starr report's strongest sections describe the sexual
activity between Ms. Lewinsky and Clinton and Clinton's repeated
misrepresentations about it under oath. The document's authors said
Clinton's evasiveness before the federal grand jury forced them to
include the salacious details about the sexual encounters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first two possible grounds for impeachment concern the
president's lying under oath about the nature of his relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky,'' the report stated. ``The details associated
with those grounds are, by their nature, explicit. The president's
testimony unfortunately has rendered the details essential with
respect to those two grounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors gave great weight to Ms. Lewinsky's accounts of
her sexual activities with the president. While the president has
admitted engaging in some forms of sexual conduct, he specifically
denied other forms. It was those statements that are the basis of
allegations of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors gave great weight to Ms. Lewinsky's accounts of
her sexual activities with the president. While the president has
admitted to some forms of sexual conduct with her, he specifically
denied other forms. Those statements are the basis of the
allegations of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   In their response, Clinton's lawyers said that answers to
ambiguous questions can never be perjury. And, they said, ``nobody
can be convicted of perjury based on only one other person's
testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   The report accuses the president and Ms. Lewinsky of agreeing to
concoct ``cover stories'' to keep their relationship a secret.
</P>
<P>
   During a March 29, 1997, sexual encounter with Ms. Lewinsky, the
president told her that ``he suspected that a foreign embassy (he
did not specify which one) was tapping his telephones, and he
proposed cover stories. If ever questioned, she should say that the
two of them were just friends. If anyone ever asked about their
phone sex, she should say that they knew their calls were being
monitored all along, and the phone sex was just a put-on,''
according to Ms. Lewinsky's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The president denied her account in his grand jury testimony.
The prosecutors wrote that Ms. Lewinsky's account was corroborated
by contemporaneous discussions she had with 11 people, including
eight friends, two psychological counselors and her mother, Marcia
Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Sections alleging abuse of power and witness tampering appear
less conclusive. The single accusation of witness tampering arose
from discussions Clinton had with his personal secretary, Betty
Currie, immediately after his deposition in the Paula Jones
lawsuit. Prosecutors believe that Clinton tried to influence her
testimony with a series of leading questions, but Mrs. Currie's
testimony on several key points was ambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   The Starr report also accused the president of abusing his
office by lying repeatedly to the public and in court proceedings.
The charge also includes the president's repeated refusal to
volunarily testify before the grand jury and his invocation of
executive privilege to block testimony by key aides. Clinton
ultimately testified after he was subpoenaed and the president's
privilege claims were denied by federal judges.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers rejected that argument, saying, ``If
allowing aides to repeat misleading statements is a crime, then any
number of public officials are guilty of misusing their office for
as long as they fail to admit wrongdoing in response to any
allegation about their activity.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The Starr report cited 11 specific possible grounds for
impeachment in four categories: Five counts of lying under oath,
four counts of obstruction of justice, one count of witness
tampering and one count of abuse of constitutional authority.
</P>
<P>
   The report, written by several assistants in Starr's office, is
methodical and exhaustive. When confronted by conflicting accounts,
it tends to accept the version most damaging to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``After being subpoenaed in July,'' the report says in one
summary passage describing what it called a pattern of perjury by
Clinton, ``the president made false statements to the grand jury on
Aug. 17, 1998. That night, the president again made false
statements to the American people and Congress, contending that his
answers in his civil deposition had been `legally accurate.' The
president then made an implicit plea for Congress to take no
action: `Our country has been distracted by this matter for too
long.'''
</P>
<P>
   The authors then place the blame squarely on the president for
the slow pace of the investigation. ``The president has pursued a
strategy of deceiving the American people and Congress in January
1998, delaying and impeding the criminal investigation for seven
months, and deceiving the American people and Congress again in
August 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps the most damaging portion of the report, Starr's
prosecutors say that Clinton lied under oath five times, both in
the Paula Jones deposition and in his grand jury testimony last
month, when he denied that he had had ``a sexual affair, a sexual
relationship or sexual relations'' with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But the report said that the president's response to lying under
oath rests on his own narrow definition of ``sexual relations'' _
``namely, that it requires sexual intercourse, no matter how
extensive the sexual activities might otherwise be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the president,'' the report says, ``a man could
regularly engage in oral sex and fondling of breasts and genitals
with a woman and yet not have a `sexual affair' with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky testified in much detail about ``substantial sexual
activity'' that she said she engaged in with Clinton, on 10
separate days in hallways, bathrooms and the president's private
study, from Nov. 15, 1995, to Dec. 28, 1997. She said that Clinton
made direct contact with her breasts and genitalia.
</P>
<P>
   To corroborate her statements, prosecutors point to her own
testimony, and statements she made to 11 people. They also quote a
draft letter, gleaned from Ms. Lewinsky's home computer, in which
Ms. Lewinsky describes an incident in her relationship with the
president where she refers to ``watching your mouth on my breast''
and refers imiplicity to direct contact with her genitalia.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky said that the president's ``hands-off policy''
suggests some kind of ``service contract _ that all I did was
perform oral sex on him and that that's all this relationship
was.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the grand jury, Clinton was denied that he had sexual
relations with Ms. Lewinsky ``and said, in effect, that Monica
Lewinsky was lying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You are free to infer that my testimony is that I did not have
sexual relations, as I understood this term to be defined,'' he
testifed before the grand jury from the White House on Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor asked, ``Including touching her breast, kissing
her breast, touching her genitalia?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's correct,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Friday, in two separate documents, there was a dispute
between the White House and Starr about fundamental facts of the
relationship. In its 78-page rebuttal, the White House wrote that
the relationship began in early 1996 and in one incident in early
1997. But in the report, Starr said that Ms. Lewinsky testified
that their intimate relationship began on Nov. 15, 1995, during the
Government shutdown when they engaged in oral sex while the
president spoke on the telephone with a congressman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The motive for the president to make a false statement about
the date on which the sexual relationship started appears to have
been that the president was unwilling to admit sexual activity with
a young 22-year-old White House intern in the Oval Office area.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr also accuses Clinton of lying under oath when he testified
he could not recall instances when he was alone with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, they said that Ms. Lewinsky testified that she was alone
on numerous occasions with the president inside the Oval Office,
the president's private study, the private bathroom across from the
study and the hallway that leads from the Oval Office to the
private dining room.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr's prosecutors have other witnesses who testified that
the president and Ms. Lewinsky were alone together, including Betty
Currie, the president's secretary, six Secret Service agents and a
White House steward, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   In the obstruction of justice portion of the report, prosecutors
say that Clinton took an active role in trying to hide his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky from the Jones lawyers and later
from Starr's investigators by concealing gifts they exchanged,
which had been subpoenaed.

DAVID HOLLADAY, 73, EXPERT IN AIR SAFETY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Holladay, a specialist in aviation safety, died on Sept. 4
at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, Calif. Holladay, a
resident of Jamul, Calif., was 73.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, said Craig DeRousse, his stepson.
</P>
<P>
   Holladay became a licensed pilot when he was 18, and he spent
his career flying and working in the aviation industry. In 1964, he
started Aviaction, a consulting firm for aviation safety with
clients that included NATO and more than two dozen countries. Since
starting Aviaction, Holladay has been an investigator and
consultant in more than 500 investigations of aviation accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Holladay learned to fly at age 15, joined the Army Air Force and
rose to be a captain in the Air Force Reserves. In 1947, when he
was 22, he was in a near-fatal plane crash. The accident, and a
plane crash he saw when he was 9 years old in Orangeburg, S.C.,
inspired his interest in safety, DeRousse said.
</P>
<P>
   Holladay received a bachelor's degree in education from the
University of Southern California in 1971, and an MBA from
Pepperdine University in 1976. After he retired from the Air Force
in 1969, Holladay became head of the safety curriculum in the
aerospace department at the University of Southern California in
Los Angeles. He continued to teach at USC until 1970.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Carol, of Jamul; his stepson, Craig,
of Manhattan Beach, Calif.; four sons from a previous marriage,
David Jr., of Pittsburgh; Mark, of Maui, Hawaii; Kevin of Hermosa
Beach, Calif.; Kyle, of Las Vegas, N.M., and one granddaughter.

   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. _ He is an Ivy league graduate with a thirst
for books, mainly biographies. Numbers were never Joe Paterno's
thing, although he has amassed enough to keep football-minded
mathematicians searching for an algorithm to his success.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers reflect endurance. He has been at Penn State for 49
years _ the last 33 as head football coach. He has been voted coach
of the year by his colleagues an unprecedented four times, and he
has watched more than 200 of his Nittany Lions go to the National
Football League.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers also demonstrate excellence. He has suffered only
one losing season, has led his team to 18 bowl victories and has
won two national titles, in 1982 and 1986.
</P>
<P>
   And there are numbers that summon heartbreak: four times, in
1968, '69, '73 and '94, Paterno teams have posted perfect seasons
and were denied the national title.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there's the number he says he doesn't care about _ 300 _
though it will be the focus of this weekend in college football.
</P>
<P>
   If the heavily favored Nittany Lions beat Bowling Green, the
Brooklyn-born Paterno will join a small, colorful fraternity of
coaching greats with 300 or more victories. In Division I-A,
there's Bear Bryant at 323, Pop Warner at 319 and Amos Alonzo Stagg
at 314. In Division I-AA, Eddie Robinson won 408 at Grambling, and
in Division III, John Gagliardi has won 343 and is still coaching
at St. John's in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many people that make these things happen. Good
football players, coaching staff,'' the 71-year-old Paterno said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have guys on my staff that I recruited out of high school
and I've been with since they graduated high school, and they have
as much to do with what went on here as I do. I hate to zero in as
if this is a personal achievement. This is a program achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   On a day when two Heisman Trophy contenders, Texas' Ricky
Williams and UCLA's Cade McNown, square off in Los Angeles and two
nationally ranked teams try to stop early-season slides as Syracuse
(0-1) plays at Michigan (0-1), Beaver Stadium in central
Pennsylvania's Nittany Valley will be the center of the college
football universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have our hands full with Bowling Green,'' Paterno
maintained, staying true to a script that has brought him 299
victories, 77 losses and 3 ties.
</P>
<P>
   The game will be a celebration of Paterno's consistency _ in all
things. He has used the quaint phrase, ``We need to tend to our
knitting,'' since he was a quarterback at Brown University and
still can't help calling Frank Solich a ``Pennsylvania kid'' though
the new coach at Nebraska is 53.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been able to win and he has done it the right way,''
Michigan Coach Lloyd Carr said. ``His way _ with integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   His first victory came against Maryland, 15-7, in 1966, and it
was a rare highlight in a tough 5-5 season, even though Maryland
coach Lou Saban fled the field instead of offering a congratulatory
handshake. Saban, who had won a championship in the old American
Football League, called and apologized a few days later. ``We were
both so lousy I didn't have the heart to congratulate anybody,''
Paterno said Saban told him.
</P>
<P>
   He coached against only one other member of the 300-plus club,
Bryant, but it made an indelible impression on him. ``I learned
from him that I was not as good of a coach as I thought was,''
Paterno said. ``He was so laid back and would really give you a
misleading appearance of what a fierce competitor he was. He really
was a gentleman. We never beat him in the four years I coached
against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida State's Bobby Bowden, who has won 282 games, understands
Paterno's reticence to talk about the number. ``You're never really
thinking about it, it just slips up on you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are perhaps better numbers than 300 with which to judge
Paterno, though the coach doesn't like talking much about them
either.
</P>
<P>
   There is the 80 percent graduation rate his players have posted
over the years. And the $3.5 million he and his wife, Sue Paterno,
donated to Penn State this year to endow faculty positions and
scholarships and to support two building projects.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the No. 2 _ only twice in his career has Paterno
missed being on the sideline of a Penn State game. The first was in
1955, when his father, Angelo, died. Until his old coach at Brown,
Rip Engle, asked him to become an assistant at Penn State, Paterno
was heading for Boston University Law School, following his father
into the legal profession.
</P>
<P>
   The other absence was in 1977 when his son, David Paterno, then
11, was seriously injured in a trampoline accident. David fractured
his skull, spent several days in a coma and eventually recovered.
But Paterno stood vigil at the hospital in State College while the
Nittany Lions beat Syracuse, 31-24, on the road.
</P>
<P>
   So no matter what happens here Saturday, the coach closing in on
history says he wants to maintain his normal routine. As the
Paternos have done after most home games spanning four decades, Sue
will put together an Italian meal and family and friends will
gather.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have a couple of laughs, hopefully,'' he said. ``Win
or lose, we will have a couple of laughs.''

GREEN RUNS FOR SENATE ON REPUTATION AS CONSUMER GADFLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In all of his nearly 30 years working in public
interest law, Mark Green has focused on consumer issues _ a decade
as an aide to Ralph Nader, nine years as head of his own liberal
think tank and eight years in municipal government, the last five
as New York City's elected ombudsman.
</P>
<P>
   He has pushed legislation to prevent businesses from charging
women more for services like haircuts and dry cleaning, gone after
noisy discotheques and unlicensed home construction contractors,
and even led a battle against inflated prices of kosher food for
Passover.
</P>
<P>
   And eight years ago, demonstrating his ability to identify an
issue early on, Green, then New York City's consumer affairs
commissioner, tackled Joe Camel, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.'s
well-known cartoon character, which he denounced as ``an obvious
effort to lure children into smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the city's public advocate, responsible for handling
citizens' complaints, Green, who likes to brag that he has never
cast a legislative vote, is running on this record as a lifelong
gadfly in his pursuit of the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In both government jobs he has held, his major purpose has been
to generate reports and to speak out about them. And that has made
his public record an oddity as well, one that demonstrates
accomplishments but almost always on issues of his own interest and
choosing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always tried to be an advocate taking on big shots and
big interests,'' he often says on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   His brand of high-octane advocacy and tendency to seize on
predictably popular issues is seen by some critics as
grandstanding. ``He's a former consumer affairs commissioner who
still thinks he's consumer affairs commissioner,'' said Randy
Mastro, a former deputy mayor in the Giuliani administration.
</P>
<P>
   What is certain is that Green aggressively courts the press to
promote his causes, and by extension, himself. He is well known for
institutionalizing the Sunday news conference, taking advantage of
what is traditionally the slowest news day of the week to garner
attention.
</P>
<P>
   As an official, Green, 53, plays an odd role _ part government
insider and part government watchdog.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has maintained a high profile throughout most of his
public life _ his current job places him first in line after the
mayor in the city's elected hierarchy _ and has held jobs that gave
him influence on a range of issues, he has enjoyed little direct
authority.
</P>
<P>
   As consumer affairs commissioner, from 1990 to 1993, Green had
regulatory control over more than 50 industries and had the
capacity to open investigations and levy sanctions. But the real
authority rested with his boss, Mayor David Dinkins.
</P>
<P>
   As public advocate, the only elective office he has ever held,
he has the power to write and propose legislation in the City
Council. But he is not entitled to vote unless there is a tie,
which is a virtual impossibility, and he has never cast a deciding
vote on the council.
</P>
<P>
   Because he lacks a vote to barter with, Green has the burden of
cajoling council members to support his initiatives. In most cases,
he is able to do this because he focuses on issues with widespread
public support _ like the bill he pushed in 1997 that guaranteed
insurance coverage for annual mammograms for women over 40.
</P>
<P>
   Often simply by raising issues, Green has done his job because
it brings attention to the issue and helps build up public
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone recognizes that he has positioned himself as a
consumer advocate,'' said Councilman Kenneth Fisher of Brooklyn,
who has worked with Green. ``It doesn't necessarily mean that he is
representing the consumer interest on every issue. That's why not
all of his legislation or all of his proposals move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   In his role as the city's ombudsman, Green is part public
conscience, part official nudger. An examination of his time inside
and outside government reveals that at times he has had a
substantial, even disproportional influence on local, state and
federal policy-making.
</P>
<P>
   For example, his early complaint to the Federal Trade Commission
about the marketing of cigarettes to minors, put him at the
forefront of what would become a major national issue. Last year,
the FTC brought official charges against R.J. Reynolds, and the
company dropped Joe Camel.
</P>
<P>
   A study that he did in 1992 about how the state's matrimonial
law allowed divorce lawyers to take advantage of female clients,
led to an investigation by a judicial panel, which prompted Chief
Judge Judith Kaye of the Court of Appeals to impose strict new
rules for divorce lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   More than either of his major rivals for the nomination _
Geraldine Ferraro and Charles Schumer _ Green has hammered away at
his opponents' records, asserting that Ms. Ferraro, the 1984 vice
presidential nominee, is running on fame, and that Schumer, the
nine-term representative from Brooklyn, is running on money. Green
claims that he alone is running on the issues.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ferraro, a former member of the House of Representatives
from Queens, is quick to suggest that Green has no right to comment
on her voting record in Congress because he has never cast a
legislative vote in his life. Yet, as author and sponsor, he has
submitted dozens of bills to the council, many of which have
passed.
</P>
<P>
   One, on campaign finance reform, giving increased government
matching funds to candidates who do not accept corporate money, was
co-sponsored by the Speaker Peter Vallone and passed in July.
Another piece of legislation, sponsored by Green and Councilwoman
Ronnie Eldridge, would protect victims of domestic violence from
discrimination in the workplace should they need to use company
time to call doctors or lawyers or for other help. A vote on the
bill is expected this year.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual record that Green brings to the race has proved both
a curse and a blessing. While he has been criticized for lack of a
voting record, he is at the same time shielded from being attacked
for his views on a range of hot-button issues. ``I don't think
anybody is insulated from criticism, but you don't have the votes
to pick apart,'' said Andrew Stein, the former City Council
president, the post that became public advocate in 1994. ``You
don't have the hard record to come up against as you did with
specific votes cast.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, with his history of battling big interests on behalf of
small shoppers, and of fighting discrimination against minorities,
women and the poor, Green has built a strong following. He won
re-election last year with a higher percentage of the vote than
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor is one of the harshest critics of Green's office,
calling it useless and suggesting that it should be abolished. And
in occasional pokes at Green's political ambitions, the mayor has
said that he does not take long vacations because it would leave
Green in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters see him as a human incarnation of the Better
Business Bureau, as fairness personified. Often he is stopped on
the street by people with questions about consumer issues.
</P>
<P>
   Green benefits from having no predecessor as public advocate to
be compared with and from never having had to address issues
unpopular with voters. ``Because you don't have that much
responsibility, you can pick and choose what you want and stay away
from what you don't want,'' Stein said.

 IN TEXAS A LABORATORY TEST ON THE EFFECTS OF SUING HMOs  
 (ART ADV: Graphic estimating increase of premiums if patients could
sue HMO; patient protection bills is being sent to NYT graphic
clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling
(888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)   (af)  
 By CAROL MARIE CROPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ To hear lobbyists and lawmakers in Washington tell it,
giving patients the right to sue insurers that refuse to approve
medical treatment would be either the death of managed care or the
salvation of patients.
</P>
<P>
   If federal protection against such suits is eliminated, ``you'd
have businesses dropping health care coverage right and left,''
warned Mark Merritt, a vice president of the American Association
of Health Plans.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of such a change argue that it is the fair thing to
do. ``If you make a medical decision affecting patient care, you've
got to be responsible for it,'' said John Stone, a spokesman for
Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., who sponsored an early liability bill,
which has been stuck in a House committee.
</P>
<P>
   Under the banner of patients' rights, a new set of bills is
under consideration in Congress; some of which would allow a
broader range of legal actions against health maintenance
organizations and other employer health plans. And as Congress
takes up the proposals, many eyes are on Texas, where the ability
to file such suits, as well as a separate process to appeal
insurance decisions, has been available for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   What lessons does Texas offer? The short answer is that the
spotty early evidence does not support a lot of the dire warnings
on Capitol Hill about a landslide of litigation. In fact, lawyers
in Texas say that not one suit has been filed so far, and there
have been fewer appeals of insurance rulings than expected. Still,
decisions in fully half of those appeals have gone against the
insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors here in Texas, meanwhile, report that HMOs _ which have
been the focus of the most criticism _ are showing more willingness
to go along with their treatment plans. Yet figures reported to the
state by health plans indicate that medical costs have not begun to
spiral.
</P>
<P>
   It was stories like that of Leon Hand that persuaded a Texas
lawmaker, state Sen. David Sibley of Waco, to push through the
nation's first legislation expressly allowing malpractice suits
against HMOs and other insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Hand, 49, an auto mechanic in San Antonio, left a Humana
hospital before dawn in the fall of 1990 after a managed-care
doctor decided by phone that he did not need to be admitted for a
severe headache and high blood pressure, even though an emergency
room physician said he should stay. As he was getting into his
pickup truck, Hand said he suffered the first symptoms of a stroke.
His left side has been partly paralyzed ever since, and Hand says
he is disabled for life.
</P>
<P>
   Hand sued the Humana Health Plan of Texas but soon learned that
such a case would be pushed from state to federal court, where a
federal law would shield his employer-sponsored health plan from
virtually all liability.
</P>
<P>
   Hand settled with Humana for $100,000. He also collected
$275,000 from the managed-care doctor and a token $150 from the
emergency physician who had tried to get him admitted.
</P>
<P>
   In answering Hand's suit, the health plan denied his allegations
and added that any claims against it were barred by the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA. Bruce Anderson, a
lawyer for the managed-care doctor, said there was no way to have
predicted Hand's stroke.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the emergency room physician could have called
another doctor to try to have Hand admitted, since he was covered
by a less-restrictive preferred provider organization rather than
by an HMO.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, under the malpractice shield of ERISA, Hand
probably would have been able to collect only the cost of the
denied treatment plus court costs and legal fees _ if anything. It
is that shield that Texas has tried to pierce.
</P>
<P>
   Now, under a bill sponsored by Senate Democrats in Washington,
all states would be given the freedom to adopt similar laws. That
measure, as well as competing Republican ``patient rights'' bills
without such liability provisions, are pending before Congress. The
Norwood bill is not under active consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of exposing HMOs to such lawsuits say a health plan
should not be exempt from liability for a life-and-death decision.
They say an HMO is practicing medicine when, in a quest to contain
costs, it decides not only whether a plan covers a type of
treatment but also whether the treatment is necessary for a
particular patient.
</P>
<P>
   Now, ``if the lack of care kills you,'' Stone said, ``you can
only recover the cost of the care.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the ERISA protection, which applies only to
employer-sponsored health plans, was to keep multistate
corporations from having to tangle with a mass of state
regulations. Opponents of easing that protection say it would lead
to more litigation and higher premiums and leave fewer Americans
with health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Changing ERISA, they argue, would mean suits not only against
HMOs but also against employers who provide the insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The bills before Congress also propose independent reviews that
would let patients appeal insurance rejections without suing. Here,
too, Texas is among at least 14 states that have led the way. The
1997 Texas law allowing lawsuits also established an independent
review process that is binding on the HMO.
</P>
<P>
   Texans like Sibley _ who is a former oral surgeon and a
practicing lawyer _ have testified before congressional committees
on the state's law and have traveled nationwide to speak to others
considering such measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have circumnavigated the United States about 10 times,''
said Kim Ross, a spokeswoman for the Texas Medical Association,
which represents the state's doctors and lobbied for the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a national
organization for health care consumers, said, ``The Texas example
is cited frequently because Texas has the most far-reaching
legislation as far as this litigation question.''
</P>
<P>
   True, some Texas HMOs say they are losing money and will have to
raise premiums, but they are suffering mainly from their battle to
underbid competitors and gain market share, said George Parker
Young, a lawyer in Fort Worth who handles suits against HMOs. The
bill ``has not added one dime to the litigation budget of the HMOs,
because not one lawsuit has been filed,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Not yet, anyway. Young concedes that he is planning to file two
lawsuits soon. And Jeff Kloster, general counsel for the Texas
Association of Health Plans, a trade association for insurers,
points to newspaper ads run by Texas lawyers seeking patients as
clients and to conferences held around the state to educate trial
lawyers about the new law. ``There will be lawsuits,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even the law's proponents _ who, for the most part, say they do
not expect an onslaught _ acknowledge that it is probably a matter
of time before some suits arise. The bill took effect on Sept. 1,
1997, leaving little more than a year for patients to suffer
injuries, contact lawyers and prepare suits. Texas law generally
gives victims two years to sue.
</P>
<P>
   Young said one of the suits he was preparing involved the family
of a 68-year-old man whose HMO decided he was ready to be released
from a psychiatric ward despite his history of suicide attempts.
The night he was released, he drank antifreeze and died soon
afterward, Young said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the slow start on litigation is uncertainty over
how open the field is for litigation. Questions remain about
whether the state law can erase the presumed federal protections
without congressional action. Before the Texas law went into
effect, the Aetna Life Insurance Co. and its Texas subsidiaries
challenged the measure in federal district court in Houston. That
suit is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Even the bill's sponsor, Sibley, is unsure of the extent to
which it applies to ERISA-protected plans, which may cover as many
as 80 percent of Texans with private, employer-provided insurance.
Not subject to ERISA are those covered by government employee
plans, government programs like Medicare, policies bought by
individuals and some small-employer plans.
</P>
<P>
   To complicate matters, some ERISA employer plans are more
protected than others. States have less power to regulate
self-insured employer plans _ which are widespread among the
largest employers _ than ones bought from insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Without congressional action, the question of whether Texas' law
skirts ERISA protection may have to be decided in court.
</P>
<P>
   In responding to the Aetna suit, Texas argued that its law made
HMOs liable only for ``medical treatment decisions'' that affect
the quality of patient care and therefore was not pre-empted by
federal law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress never intended to pre-empt states from regulating
people that make medical decisions,'' said David C. Mattax, an
assistant attorney general in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some federal circuit courts have ruled that ERISA
protections should not apply in cases where the health plan made a
decision involving quality of care issues. So even without new
laws, ERISA's protection may narrow.
</P>
<P>
   And the Texas law is also intended to demolish one argument that
HMOs have used to avoid liability. Like some other states, Texas
bars the practice of medicine by corporations; insurers have used
that provision to argue against malpractice suits, saying that
because they are forbidden to practice medicine, they cannot be
sued for malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   But critics question that logic. ``It's like being stopped by a
cop for speeding and you say, `Well, officer, I couldn't possibly
have been speeding because it's against the law in Texas to speed,'
'' said Elizabeth Kilbride, a Houston lawyer who handles medical
malpractice cases.
</P>
<P>
   The new law removes that argument, Sibley said; Missouri made a
similar change.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas law has also not resulted in the expected number of
appeals from patients who are denied treatment by insurers.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Insurance Department forecast as many as 4,400 appeals
the first year. But by Sept. 4, just more than a year after the law
took effect, there had been only 218.
</P>
<P>
   Is this because HMOs were already doing a good job? Or because
the new law has made them more responsive? Or because patients just
haven't heard about their right to appeal? The answers depend on
whom you ask.
</P>
<P>
   Kloster, of the Texas Association of Health Plans, points to the
myriad internal appeals that were already available. The low number
of appeals to the state, he said, ``is a recognition that the
internal appeals and complaints process has always and continues to
work effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   But proponents of the appeals emphasize that about half the
independent review organization's decisions have gone against
insurers. ``We're finding out the HMO is wrong half the time,''
Young said. ``That's pretty scary.''
</P>
<P>
   And Phil Dunne, chief executive of the Texas Medical Foundation,
the only outside organization certified by the state Insurance
Department to perform reviews, said in an interview in August:
``Would you be confident if 50 percent of the time you went to a
hospital or a physician or health care provider you didn't get what
you needed?''
</P>
<P>
   While there have been relatively few independent appeals, the
number of complaints to the Insurance Department is up sharply.
</P>
<P>
   The independent review organization has overruled insurers and
granted surgery to repair a chest-wall deformity for a 4-year-old;
a kidney transplant for a 51-year-old woman, and a second
circumcision for a 9-month-old to correct a botched first one.
</P>
<P>
   It sided with insurers and turned down a 23-year-old diabetic
who wanted a special insulin injection unit because he feared
needles; a 21-year-old with a deformed head who requested surgery,
and a 48-year-old with ovarian cancer who asked for high-dose
chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   One patient who won her appeal was Dora Cisneros, 34, of
Tomball, just north of Houston, who said she suffered from chronic
pain since being treated for a hyperactive thyroid two years ago.
She appealed her health plan's denial of training in ``chronic pain
management'' so she could cope without resorting to strong drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen days after the case went into independent review, Ms.
Cisneros prevailed. ``I felt like I had won the lottery,'' she
said. ``I was just so thankful that somebody that reviewed this
could see that this was beneficial. Thank God that we live in
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cisneros said she went for her first pain-management
training session on Aug. 5. By Aug. 25, ``I was able to open up my
apple juice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so excited,'' she said. ``I feel strength coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for her managed-care plan, Jefferson Pilot
Financial, said it had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   At the organization that conducts reviews, the Texas Medical
Foundation, a doctor in the appropriate medical specialty goes over
the record and then makes a decision, Dunne said. The specialist
might consult with other experts but does not talk to the patient
or doctor involved, he said. Under Texas law, the insurer pays the
cost of the review, which is $460 or $650, depending on the
specialty.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Cisneros was pleased with the way her appeal was
handled, some others are skeptical of the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can anyone evaluate anyone properly without seeing them
one on one?'' asked James C. Benson, a Houston lawyer who
represents another patient who went through the process. ``If it's
just a records review, how is that any different than an insurance
review?''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Medical Foundation has a response. ``You're getting an
outside entity to evaluate that medical record, and that entity
doesn't have an interest in the outcome,'' said Rhonda Eidom, a
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of suits, some Texans say insurers have already
changed the way they do business to avoid lawsuits and reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Phil Berry, an orthopedic surgeon in Dallas, said insurers
were less likely to drag their feet in approving a procedure or to
give his staff members the runaround. ``We have seen a much better
attitude on the part of HMOs now as to recommendations we make for
patients,'' he said. ``They seem to be more willing to pay for what
we ask for.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Kouba, a lobbyist for the Texas Association of Business
and Chambers of Commerce, also suspects that Texas insurers have
become more liberal in approving treatment. But that does not make
him happy. ``We're looking at basically going back to indemnity
insurance days where insurers paid for whatever the physician asked
for,'' he said. ``We're going to be back to the era of defensive
medicine where there is double-digit medical inflation. Business
cannot sustain that.''
</P>
<P>
   While there are anecdotal reports that insurers are paying for
more procedures, even some unnecessary ones, insurance department
statistics through the end of March suggest otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The state's full-service HMOs reported an increase of only 0.7
percent in the amount spent on medical expenses for each member per
month from the end of September 1997, compared with a 4.5 percent
increase the previous six months.
</P>
<P>
   A national survey this year by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a
health care philanthropy, and Harvard University found that 55
percent of respondents said they were at least ``somewhat worried''
that if they were sick their health plan would be more concerned
about saving money than about the best treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-four percent said they favored a law allowing patients to
sue health plans for malpractice, and 88 percent wanted a law
requiring independent reviews. Support dropped when those polled
were faced with the prospect of employers' stopping coverage or
insurers' raising premiums.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, there is a wide gulf between the estimates of
what such protections would cost.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office reported that the Democratic
bill's liability provision would add 1.2 percent to insurance
premiums. Its independent review process would add three-tenths of
a percent, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   A study conducted by the Barents Group of KPMG Peat Marwick for
the American Association of Health Plans predicted that the
liability provision in Norwood's bill could push up premiums as
much as 8.6 percent and result in a loss of health insurance for
1.8 million Americans. The insurance trade group says the same
analysis would apply to the Senate Democrats' legislation, which
has a similar provision.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-seven percent of employers responding to a Chamber survey
in July said they would drop employee health coverage if Congress
approved legislation that could make them liable in malpractice
suits.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, Sibley, who won a Friend of Business award in 1995
from the Texas Association of Business and Chambers of Commerce for
his role in passing tort reform, said he hoped Congress would
reject all the bills. Sibley said he feared that the bill from
House Republican leaders would undo what Texas had done. The
Democratic bill would open businesses as well as insurers to
liability, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stone and others suspect that nothing will happen during this
session, which is scheduled to end on Oct. 9. The Republican
leadership does not want added patient protections, he said, and
the Democrats would be just as happy to keep the issue alive to use
in coming elections.
</P>
<P>
   Support is growing to simply watch Texas for the next two years
to see what happens there, he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Lone Star State yields little that is definitive for
either side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'll see the true impact until the ERISA
pre-emption goes away _ if it goes away _ and we see lawsuits
filed,'' said Kloster of the state health plan association.

FORMER ARIZONA GOV. MECHAM BACKS CLINTON EXIT; OTHERSMORE
CAUTIOUS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Former Arizona Gov. Evan Mecham on Friday called on President
Clinton to resign as political leaders across the state ducked for
cover, while others took a more cautious approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Clinton is on his way out,'' said Mecham, who was
impeached in 1988 on charges of obstructing justice and improper
use of state funds.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton realizes his own impeachment is imminent, he will
resign, Mecham said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Innocent people don't resign,'' he added, explaining why he
refused to step down. ``He's obviously guilty of things and I
wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic congressional candidate Steve Owens was campaigning
in Flagstaff and had not yet read the report, but he also said he
found Clinton's personal conduct to be ``absolutely deplorable and
reprehensible.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens said he would keep an open mind until examining the
report, adding that he hadn't seen anything in media reports before
Friday that would suggest that Clinton should resign or be
impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, leaders from both parties were restrained, preferring
to gauge public reaction to the graphic 445-page report by
independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Several urged Congress to decide soon whether to go ahead with
impeachment proceedings, censure the president or drop the whole
thing.
</P>
<P>
   And some Democrats said they felt betrayed by Clinton's actions,
especially after the lurid details began to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some personal disappointment,'' said Sen. Mary
Hartley, D-northwest Phoenix. ``But I still can't fault him for
being a lousy president. A lousy human being, yes, but not a lousy
president. You're not going to hear me calling for his
resignation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartley said she would prefer that the impeachment process move
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's what Congress feels should be done, let it go
forth,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Hull, a Republican, also stopped short of calling for
Clinton's resignation, saying in a statement that the president
``must consider all of his options. We should insist on a higher
standard for our elected leaders. Even the president must be
responsible for his actions.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Jeff Groscost, R-Mesa, called on Congress to
``work through this issue quickly and get this terrible episode
behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad part of all this is the fact that it is all because of
our president,'' Groscost said. ``He is really the only one who
could put this behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Forgiveness could only be extended to Clinton if he does two
things: apologize and change his ways, Groscost said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've certainly heard his apology four or five times a day,''
Groscost said, ``but has he changed his ways?''
</P>
<P>
   Mecham called it a ``tawdry'' time, but said removing Clinton
from office would help cleanse the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country is a lot bigger than Bill Clinton,'' Mecham said.
</P>
<P>
   He also predicted the scandal would make voters more careful
about deciding whom to support, because many voters ignored
allegations in 1992 and 1996 that Clinton had had extramarital
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   There also has been speculation that disgusted Democrats will
stay away from the polls on Nov. 3, making it difficult for their
party's candidates to win election both at the state and national
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Hartley disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans have weathered the last decade,'' she said,
adding that despite Mecham's impeachment and the conviction and
resignation of former Gov. Fife Symington a year ago, the
Republicans still are in the majority in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think it will hurt us that much.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Party attempts to pull together
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- It was a somber day for many House Democrats as
they confronted the public release of a report from independent
counsel Kenneth Starr alleging President Clinton lied under oath
about a sexual affair with a former White House intern and then
obstructed justice in trying to keep the relationship secret.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats struggled with uncertainty about what the future would
bring for their president and their own electoral chances now just
six weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   Two views emerged among House Democrats as they left the
calamity of Capitol Hill for the relative sanctuary of their
districts with the 445-page Starr report tucked under arms and
stuffed in briefcases.
</P>
<P>
   Some continued the drum roll defense of the president, saying
Clinton has been unfairly maligned by Starr, whom they view as an
overzealous prosecutor on a wide-ranging probe that has yielded
``nothing but details of a sexual affair,'' as one member put it.
</P>
<P>
   Others, noticeably quieter and smaller than the first, expressed
outright frustration with the president and a simmering anger that
he had deceived the American people about an affair he had with
Monica Lewinsky. They felt that the credibility of the presidency
had been placed at stake and the question was no longer could he
lead, but should he lead.
</P>
<P>
   This apparent divide in the party, despite White House attempts
to deliver an image of unity at a lawn event Friday evening, left
leaders wondering how to bring the party together at a time when
Congress is taking its first step in a multilayered impeachment
process of the president. The House voted Friday to refer the Starr
report to the House Judiciary Committee and to publicly release the
Starr report, which includes 11 grounds for impeaching the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most members feel that we have to take our time, pace
ourselves,'' said Rep. John Lewis, (D-Ga.), the party's chief
deputy whip, who said he would spend the weekend talking to members
across the country in an attempt to bring together the various
factions of his party. ``The disgrace in this whole thing is four
years and more than $40 million that has been spent by Starr, and
what they're dealing with is the president's sexual affairs, the
president's sexual appetite.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressional Black Caucus expressed a fairly solid line of
support behind Clinton. Nearly half of the votes against releasing
the report to the public came from the Black Caucus, a sign that
despite the allegations in the Starr report, the caucus intended to
defend the president.
</P>
<P>
   California Democrat Maxine Waters, president of the black caucus
and a member of the Judiciary Committee, calls the caucus the
``fairness police.'' Having witnessed false prosecutions of
minorities and abuse of police power in black communities, Waters
said she plans to read the Starr report with a dose of skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from a history of people who have had to fight for
equality and fairness,'' Waters said.
</P>
<P>
   But Virginia Democrat Rep. James Moran, a centrist, sharply
disagreed. He said that while some from ``the more liberal areas
think this is much to do about very little, they think this is a
matter about sex exclusively,'' but he thinks the charges are
``much more serious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's more than that. It's a matter about lying under
oath,'' Moran said. ``It's a matter of deliberately misleading all
the American people, and it may be a matter of habitual conduct
unbecoming of the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials from the Democratic National Committee expressed
optimism in pulling together the party, saying they will focus
their attention on issues affecting America's working families.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I've read of the report, it's completely about
sex,'' said Rick Hess, spokesperson for the DNC. ``Starr has spent
$40 million, and this is what we get? You can spend $5.99 and get a
trashy romance novel that reads better. ``

 &HT;    Republicans remain resolute
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As America read about lurid details of President
Clinton's sex life Friday, there were early expressions of surprise
from some leading congressional Republicans that independent
counsel Kenneth Starr's report revolved exclusively around the
president's relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am surprised we got a document that only deals with Monica
Lewinsky,'' said Rep. John Linder (R-Ga.), a close ally of Speaker
Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   In Linder's view, Starr's report, which he read on an airplane
between Washington, D.C., and Atlanta Friday afternoon, contains
serious allegations of perjury, obstruction of justice and
tampering with witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's all in the ambit of a sexual environment,'' he said.
``And that could be significant in terms of how the public takes
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mark Foley (R-Fla.), echoed Linder's sentiments, saying he
thought Starr might make reference to some of the other matters the
independent counsel has been investigating for more than four
years, including Whitewater, the handling of sensitive FBI files
and the firing of the White House travel staff.
</P>
<P>
   Linder said that in his view, the FBI files issue has been
Clinton's ``most grievous transgression.''
</P>
<P>
   The potential import of the absence of these issues is that the
public could look at Starr's work and decide it is all about
Clinton and sex, Linder said.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of public reaction, Linder said, would allow Democrats
to stand with Clinton rather than opt for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, other Republicans said the report appears to contain
enough damning information for the House to go ahead with an
impeachment investigation.
</P>
<P>
   After reading much of Starr's report Friday, Rep. Lamar Smith
(R-Texas) said, ``It's more likely than not'' that the House
Judiciary Committee ``will take the next step and recommend an
impeachment inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The allegations are far more serious than I had expected...''
said Smith, one of 21 Republicans on the committee. ``It's not
pretty reading, but it shows how serious the allegations are.''
</P>
<P>
   The view from the top of the Republican hierarchy in the House
Friday was that little could be gained _ and much could be lost _
by joining in the criticism of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   So the debate leading up to the release of Starr's report and an
initial review of the report itself drew mainly silence from
Gingrich and House Majority Leader Richard Armey (R-Texas).
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich built his political reputation on a willingness to
engage in partisan warfare, but on Friday, he stayed above the
fray.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker presided over the entire debate on Starr's report,
not once coming down from his perch to the well of the House, where
members speak for or against pending legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker had urged lawmakers Thursday to maintain decorum and
dignity on the House floor, and he himself was tested Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich listened impassively to the comments of several
Democrats, who asked Republicans to give Clinton the same chance to
review the allegations against him that Gingrich had when the House
ethics committee charged the speaker with violating House ethics
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Christina Martin, Gingrich's spokeswoman, said his presence in
the House chamber was ``a sign of the solemnity'' of the occasion.
She could not recall Gingrich presiding over the House for that
long a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   At an afternoon speech to municipal officials, Gingrich did not
mention the Starr report at all.
</P>
<P>
   Armey, who has called for Clinton's resignation, also did not
take part in the debate. His spokeswoman said Armey would not have
any comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) and Rep. Gerald Solomon (R-N.Y.),
who led the debate for Republicans, stuck to the GOP line that any
delay in releasing the report in order to give Clinton's lawyers a
look at it would benefit the White House ``spin machine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To give the spin machine the opportunity to be the first
impact on the American people...is not bipartisanship. It's
foolishness,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   Among House leaders, only Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas) did
not hesitate to continue his criticism of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay said Clinton's apology Friday before a group of religious
leaders showed that the president ``really doesn't understand what
the remedy for wrongdoing is.''
</P>
<P>
   On the House floor, DeLay said Clinton needs to accept ``the
consequences for his actions.''

 &HT;    Forgiveness is the key for Floridans
 &HT;    By Dan Moffett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As graphic details of President Clinton's indiscretions became
public Friday, his supporters and detractors found themselves
joined in disappointment over what they were learning.
</P>
<P>
   Some tried to forgive, but for others it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our responsibility as Christians is to restore him as soon as
possible,'' said Rev. Reuben Jackson of the Mount Carmel Missionary
Baptist Church in Jupiter. ``This is a terrible thing, but then sin
is a terrible thing. We look at him as a president, but we also
must look at him as a human being. We must forgive.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Leonid Feldman of Temple Emanu-El in Palm Beach believes
the nation must repent as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sickened by the stickers that said, `It's the Economy,
Stupid,' '' he said, referring to Clinton's 1992 campaign platform.
``We have all sinned because we have lost our values. We chose a
president we knew was a liar and not a moral man. In Judaism we
definitely believe in forgiveness. But we all need to be forgiven.
We need to be concerned about much more than the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   At Howley's restaurant in West Palm Beach, Anna McIntosh is a
ranking member of the retirees' breakfast club that has met there
for nearly two decades, attempting to solve the world's problems.
The consensus at Howley's rear table is that Clinton should go.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had any guts, he'd retire,'' McIntosh said. ``How can we
believe him about anything anymore? I think what's disappointing is
that people don't seem to care about morals any more as long as
they're making money.''
</P>
<P>
   At Rooney's Public House on Clematis Street in West Palm Beach,
bartender Mike Griffin, born in County Mayo, uses a measure of
Irish wisdom to sort through the turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say that to confess a fault freely is the next thing to
being innocent of it,'' Griffin said. ``He has not done that. He
has not been forthright. The sex is one thing, but to point your
finger at the American people and lie, that certainly puts a damper
on the trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the street at Clematis Street Books and Cafe, a
half-dozen computer terminals are poised for browsers to access
Kenneth Starr's report on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm expecting us to be busy,'' said Cameron Ralston, one of
the clerks. ``We'll see an influx once word of what's in the report
gets out. It might help business _ one good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   At Z Business Center on South Congress Avenue in Delray Beach,
customers can read the report on the Web or buy printout copies for
$10.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phone has been ringing off the hook,'' said Barry Schein
of Z. ``Demand for the report has been very heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   In Boynton Beach, Emily Sweeney, 34, a schoolteacher for nine
years, is now a homemaker with two children, 3 years old and 4
months. She is a native of Jonesboro, Ark., and Clinton spoke at
her graduation commencement at Arkansas State in 1987. She voted
for his presidency twice and like many today, her emotions are
warring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been a supporter of him and Hillary; they were good for
Arkansas,'' Sweeney said. ``I want to remain loyal, but I'm very
disappointed. Obstruction of justice is very serious, and that
bothers me. It's the lies that concern me the most.''
</P>
<P>
   At Lighthouse Elementary School in Jupiter, Clinton is
remembered more for the visit he paid students last November than
the deep troubles of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about him in classes,'' said principal Una
Hukill. ``We're letting parents handle that. It's not part of our
academic instruction. We answer specific questions the children may
have, but we're not delving into things in depth.''
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Ming-Hui Chen of the Chinese Christian Church in Delray
Beach said because Clinton is a role model for the nation,
forgiveness is made more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``The example he has set is not good,'' he said. ``The Bible
says we must forgive. It does not say it will be easy.''

 &HT;    Clinton finds support in Flordia
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saying that President Clinton's opponents will not stop until,
``they have spilled his blood on Pennsylvania Avenue,'' U.S. Rep.
Robert Wexler, D-Boca Raton, voted against releasing the Starr
report Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Also voting ``no'' was U.S. Rep. Alcee Hastings, D-Miramar, who
was impeached as a federal judge in 1989. Hastings, who also
represents part of Palm Beach County, said he believes the House
should have reviewed the report from Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr before releasing it to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are serious charges and I underscore the word charges,''
Hastings said. ``The fact that a whole bunch of boxes were
delivered to us does not mean that we have to box ourselves in
without taking a thoughtful look at the information given to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Wexler and Hastings were one of just 63 members of the House who
voted against the resolution releasing the report. Among the 22
members of the Florida delegation who voted, 17 voted for release
and 5 against releasing it. Starr found 11 grounds to consider
impeaching President Clinton, including perjury and obstruction of
justice in concealing his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the debate on the House floor was a mockery,''
Wexler said. ``They are talking about fairness and they would not
give the president 48 hours to review the report. When there were
ethics charges against Newt Gingrich he was given more than a week
to review the report.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling the Starr report disturbing, U.S. Rep. Mark Foley,
R-West Palm Beach, who voted for the release, said it reveals a
``total lack of mature judgment on the part of the president.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. E. Clay Shaw, R-Fort Lauderdale, who represents
coastal Palm Beach County and also voted ``yes,'' said in a
prepared statement, ``We cannot move toward impeachment without
bipartisan support, it cannot be a unilateral move by Republicans,
nor should it be. Without the support of Democrats, impeachment
cannot and should not occur.''

 &HT;    Sampras obstacle for Rafter
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York _ Patrick Rafter, the hottest player on the ATP Tour
this summer, beat Pete Sampras for the first time in five years
last month, but that won't put Rafter at ease when the two play
their rematch in the men's semifinals today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still going to be very intimidated; he's just that sort of
player,'' Rafter said. ``But it will be nothing like what I felt
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter has won 21 of his last 22 matches with a tour-leading
three titles during the hardcourt season. He beat Sampras in a
three-set final in Cincinnati, ending Sampras' eight-match winning
streak against him.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras is still touchy about how that match ended, a Rafter ace
that Sampras believes was out. When Rafter disagreed this week,
Sampras responded, ``He must be smoking something that's not
legal.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras analyzed the rematch: ``It's just a matter of return of
serve. If I can return well, make him volley, hopefully over the
course of a four- or five-set match, I can wear him down.''
</P>
<P>
   Those other guys
</P>
<P>
   French Open champion Carlos Moya is the only player besides
Sampras who made two Grand Slam semifinals this year. Though Moya
is the 10th seed, his match against Mark Philippoussis is a
toss-up. Philippoussis, more suited to hardcourts, won their only
previous meeting last year. ... Philippoussis and Rafter are the
first pair of Australians in the semifinals since 1974, which
marked the unofficial end to the Aussie men's dynasty.CBS
interrupts coverage
</P>
<P>
   CBS pre-empted the first two sets of the Jana Novotna-Martina
Hingis semifinal with three news breaks lasting one hour, 15
minutes. Another 30 minutes was lost to a regularly scheduled
30-minute news program. ``CBS has a responsibility to provide
breaking national news coverage,'' said LeslieAnn Wade, the vice
president of CBS Sports said in a statement. ``We understand the
disappointment of tennis viewers and returned to tournament
coverage as soon as possible.'' ... Though CBS could do worse than
a Hingis-Lindsay Davenport final, it's no secret that CBS felt
Venus Williams would've been better for the ratings. ``Venus is the
biggest star in the women's game,'' said Rob Correa, the vice
president of programming for CBS Sports.
</P>
<P>
   Stolle, dad make history
</P>
<P>
   Sandon Stolle made history for his family Friday when he and
Cyril Suk won the men's doubles championship in a 4-6, 7-6, 6-2
victory over Mark Knowles and Daniel Nestor. Sandon's father, Fred,
won the U.S. Open doubles title three times, twice with Roy Emerson
(1965-66) and once with Rosewall (1969). Sandon and Fred are the
only father-son pair with U.S. Open doubles title.
</P>
<P>
   Final nail in the coffin
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams brought seven of her new bare-backed tennis
outfits to the U.S. Open, one for each round. ``I'm deeply saddened
I didn't get a chance to wear my seventh dress,'' said Williams,
whose sixth one was red. ``I'm going to put it in a coffin and bury
it.''

 &HT;    Davenport powers to final against Hingis
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Martina Hingis, down 4-1 in the third set to Jana
Novotna, rose to her feet fighting and saved her No. 1 ranking.
Lindsay Davenport, calling to bear the most prodigious
groundstrokes in women's tennis, outslugged Venus Williams and made
the U.S. Open final for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the heroines Friday at Arthur Ashe Stadium: Hingis,
the defending champion and still No. 1, beating Novotna 3-6, 6-1,
6-4, and Davenport, whose hardcourt summer record surged to a
tour-best 19-1, beating Williams 6-4, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   But some fans will still want to know: Was that another choke
for Novotna, and can Davenport return today exorcised of the
self-doubts that have kept her the world's best player never to win
a Grand Slam title?
</P>
<P>
   For Novotna, time heals wounds, but it doesn't forget. She
denied thinking of 1993, when she served at 4-1 in the third set of
the Wimbledon final against Steffi Graf and couldn't win another
game. It happened again against Hingis, exactly the same way.
</P>
<P>
   The reigning Wimbledon champion appeared pestered if not hurt by
the reminders.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not going to write about it, people have nothing to
think about, so don't ask this question feeling sorry for me,''
Novotna said. ``I don't have anything to prove. I said that right
after (winning) Wimbledon (this year). I said I hope that this will
be the beginning of a new Jana.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis took up for her doubles partner. ``She didn't choke too
much,'' said Hingis, not meaning it sarcastically. ``I had to make
it myself.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Novotna struggled to serve all day in a match of
stylish groundstrokes, Hingis' two-handed backhand against the
slices and charges of Novotna. But Hingis won 18 of the final 22
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I played a wonderful match,'' Novotna said. ``I
could have lost 6-2, 6-2, nothing to talk about. But this way we
produced some great tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis secured her No. 1 ranking. Had Hingis lost, Novotna and
Davenport would've wrestled for it today on centre court.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I was fighting,'' said Hingis, who's been on top 75
straight weeks. ``I was raised that way, that I always have
pressure on me, the harder the better. That helps me.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport has beaten Williams in three of their four meetings
this year, five of six all-time, and afterward she sounded more
like the myth that is Williams, a cocky teenager who should respect
her elders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at this as a good opportunity to get to the finals,
knowing that I could beat my opponent,'' Davenport said of
Williams. ``I looked at my other (potential) opponents in the
semifinals _ Arantxa (Sanchez-Vicario), Conchita (Martinez) and
Monica (Seles), and I looked at this one as being my best shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport and Williams traded service breaks three times in the
first set, but Davenport dominated on serve in the second, losing
just four points in five games. Williams, broken five of 10 times,
won fewer than half her service points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just unable to take the opportunities,'' said Williams,
who could point to the three times she broke Davenport in the first
set. ``They were there for the taking. I said, `No, thank you.'
Pushed them away.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport has three titles this summer, and one, in Los Angeles,
included a three-set victory in the final over Hingis, who hasn't
won a title since May. Yet Davenport has never been in the final of
a Grand Slam event, and she knows what fans are saying about her.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I lose I'll hear, `She'll never win one again,''' Davenport
said. ``For me, I just keep the attitude like every year's gotten
better. If it's not meant to be tomorrow, I've got a great shot
next year. But I know I'm going for it. This has been my dream, to
win the U.S. Open.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hideki Irabu broke out of the passive funk he has
been mired in recently as he passionately went strikeout for
strikeout and bean ball for bean ball with Toronto's Roger Clemens
Friday night before a Yankee Stadium crowd that witnessed the
intensity of the two pitchers lead to a bench-clearing fight.
</P>
<P>
   But Irabu, who was trying to put the pieces of his confidence
back together and salvage a spot on the playoff roster, could not
overcome a disturbing pattern of striking out one batter while
giving up a home run to the next. Pumped one minute, pummeled the
next. Irabu gave up a career-high four home runs while striking out
eight Blue Jays, and allowed five runs in six-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who were able to nick at the exterior of Clemens,
could not break through against the Blue Jay relievers. Toronto, in
the race for a wild-card spot, left with a 5-4 victory against the
Yankees, a team growing increasingly unsteady on the mound. With a
record of 103-42, the chances of matching the 1906 Cubs, who set
the major-league record for victories at 116, seem more and more
remote.
</P>
<P>
   A fallible Clemens, who had won his last 13 decisions and had
begun separating himself from David Wells and Boston's Pedro
Martinez in the race for the Cy Young award, was bullied by the
Yankees for three runs before he exited in the fifth inning. Just
like Irabu, he began the game by serving up a pile of strikeouts;
he left with seven. But after a line-drive smacked into his wrist
in the third, Clemens did not seem as crisp.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees seized the moment. Though they have clinched their
division and should be playing with the laid-back demeanor of a
team lolling its way through spring training, the Yankees'
responded to Irabu's intensity and tit-for-tat with Clemens by
leaving the bench to unload a few shoves and blows with the Blue
Jays in the top of the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   When Clemens hit the Yankees' Scott Brosius in the fourth inning
_ after giving up an irritating three runs _ Manager Joe Torre came
out to argue that the fastball was bounced off Brosius
intentionally. But umpire Mike Reilly did not bend, and he ejected
Torre, the first time the manager has been thrown out this season.
Minutes later, Irabu opened the fifth by hitting Shannon Stewart
with his first pitch. Stewart yelled at Irabu, and was restrained
by catcher Joe Girardi.
</P>
<P>
   But Irabu left the mound and made a beeline for Stewart at the
plate. Reliever Mike Stanton darted from the Yankees' bench and
grabbed the irate Irabu. As he was being subdued, benches cleared
and a skirmish broke out. In a side fight, Darryl Strawberry
appeared to throw a punch in the direction of a couple of Blue Jays
as Clemens screamed and had to be restrained just feet away. Homer
Bush was also involved in a fight.
</P>
<P>
   After the players were separated, Strawberry, Bush, and coach
Don Zimmer, who was arguing with the umpires, were tossed out of
the game. For Toronto, pitcher Bill Risley and Manager Tim Johnson
were ejected.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When play resumed with the game tied, 3-3, Irabu seemed
inspired, sitting down his next three batters. But as it happened
throughout the game, just when his confidence seemed to gain
momentum, a pitch would get away from him. In the sixth, he gave up
his third home run of the night when a 1-1 pitch was taken into the
right-field seats by Jose Cruz to put the Blue Jays ahead, 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens started out strong, but in the third, after he stabbed
one hot grounder by Joe Girardi with his bare pitching hand and
turned it into a double play, he tried to field a liner off the bat
of Chuck Knoblauch. This time, Clemens was left shaking his hand
after the line drive ricocheted off his pitching wrist.
</P>
<P>
   He recovered to strike out Derek Jeter to end the third. Perhaps
numbness or pain or both crept into his delivery, because the
Yankees began to swat Clemens with regularity in the fourth inning.
Tino Martinez smacked a double to highlight a three-run barrage
</P>
<P>
   That's when the calm, deliberate face of this game changed. Even
before that, Irabu was obviously charged. There were moments when
his fastball and splitter worked like that of Clemens, and then
there were times when the Blue Jays feasted on everything Irabu had
to offer.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, on June 10, Irabu was 6-1 with a league-leading
1.59 ERA, baffling batters with a hard fastball and split-fingered
fastball that was darting in and out, up and down. Always movement.
Very Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   But that movement started to die, the losses started to pile up
and his ERA swelled to the season-high of 4.28, which is how he
began Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stuff,'' Torre said, ``I just need to see stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre got a glimpse of Irabu's old splitter and fastball as he
struck out four of the first five batters he faced. But then Irabu
began to lose his movement and the Blue Jays pounced on him for
repeated home runs. While Irabu showed some signs of emotion in his
fight for a playoff roster spot, he is far from winning over Torre.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch shrugged his shoulders and said Friday that he
knew nothing about a tentative understanding to extend his contract
with the Yankees beyond the three years and $18 million that still
remain on his current deal. But according to a member of the
Yankees' organization in the Friday edition of The New York Times,
the team did reach an understanding to give Knoblauch a two-year
and $18 million extension at the time of his trade to the Yankees
in February. ... Tim Raines, who did not play Friday night, is not
expected to play for the next couple of games because of a sore
left knee. Manager Joe Torre said Raines came to him Thursday and
said he injured the knee a day before against the Red Sox earlier
in the week.

ARIZONA RELIGIOUS LEADERS DISCUSS CLINTON'S PLEA FOR FORGIVENESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KELLY ETTENBOROUGH  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Book of Life is open during the High Holy Days, the Jewish
tradition goes, and God writes in the names of who will live and
who will die.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of Yom Kippur, the gates of repentance close and the
Book of Life is sealed. Yom Kippur begins at sundown Sept. 29, and
during the days leading up to it Jews around the world seek
reconciliation and forgiveness from God and from those whom they
have wronged.
</P>
<P>
   So, President Clinton appropriately quoted from the Yom Kippur
liturgy at Friday's prayer breakfast in Washington, said Rabbi
Robert Kravitz, area director of The American Jewish Committee in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for us, turning does not come so easily. . . . It means
saying I'm sorry. . . . But unless we turn, we will be trapped
forever in yesterday's ways. Lord, help us to turn,'' Clinton read
during his remarks to religious leaders prior to the release of the
Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   For people of faith in the Phoenix area, Clinton's words on
Friday rang of someone who was truly sorry for the pain he had
caused.
</P>
<P>
   Only God knows Clinton's heart, religious leaders said. Only the
legal system can decide his innocence or guilt, they said. But,
they also are waiting to see if his actions follow his words.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tells me he's seeking, he's searching, he's trying to get
out of the morass,'' said Kravitz, who met Clinton at a 1995 prayer
breakfast. ``My tradition teaches that it isn't the words we say
but the actions we perform that are more significant.''
</P>
<P>
   John Tuitele, a physical therapist and a Christian, was
encouraged by the president's statement, saying it was his first
true apology. Yet, he's concerned about the president's pledge to
vigorously defend himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm struggling between two points: hoping the best for our
president, a man of enormous influence, and struggling with the
axiom that `the best predictor of future behavior is past' . . .
Time will tell,'' said Tuitele, who lives in Peoria and attends New
Life Community Church.
</P>
<P>
   Forgiveness has two components, said the Rev. Dr. Steve Tracy, a
teaching pastor at First Baptist Church of Tempe and an associate
professor at Phoenix Seminary,where he teaches a class on biblical
sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Forgiveness as putting away bitterness and hatred and as having
a desire for healing should be given freely, the way God forgives
man, said Tracy, who also counsels men who are adulterers.
Restoration of trust must be earned, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Clinton to finally call it sin and nothing less, to say he
realizes that he's broken the country's trust, he's sorry for how
he's hurt people . . . he's saying all the things in Christian
theology that forgiveness needs to encompass,'' Tracy said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Lei Lanni Burt, pastoral care minister at Unity Church
of Phoenix, counsels married couples in crisis. Clinton needs
professional help to change, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bigger issue is a mind or a heart that can apparently hide
what's going on,'' Burt said. ``In the times we are living,
politically and religiously, in every aspect of life we are being
called to integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   In Islam, the only unforgiveable sin is worshiping something
besides God, said Hyder Ali, a Muslim and software engineer who
lives in Chandler, Ariz. Muslims follow strict rules in
relationships with the opposite sex so they do not compromise their
beliefs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton is repentant, he should make public his guidelines
for ethical conduct and his plans for accountability, Ali said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton's said he's sorry more than once. Over time he has to
prove he is really sorry. To regain people's confidence, it takes
time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the allegations are substantiated, then Clinton will suffer
the consequences of his actions, the religious leaders said.
Forgiveness doesn't mean the country goes on its merry way and
ignores illegal activities. But, there's forgiveness even in that,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be the first ones to pray for him and recognize we
need forgiveness no less than he does,'' Tracy said. ``In Christian
theology, there's no sin that's unforgiveable.''
</P>
<P>
   Roman Catholic churches across the country have a common
Scripture reading each week as they work through the Bible. This
Sunday, the passage is Luke 15:1-32, the story of the prodigal son
and his father's joy in his return: ``Let us eat and celebrate,
this son of mine was dead and he is alive again, he was lost and is
found.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a beautiful reading for the weekend,''
said the Rev. Eric Tellez, priest of St. Patrick's Catholic Church
in Scottsdale. ``We don't know whether the son who came back was
sorry or not and that wasn't the point of the story. The emphasis
is on God's mercy and love.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the challenge for the nation as well as an opportunity
to learn about grace and forgiveness, no matter what the outcome,
Tellez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can be God-like by offering forgiveness towards others,
just as God has been compassionate toward others,'' Tellez said. &QL;

BEDBUGS AND FELLOWSHIP AT THE SUNSHINE HOTEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID ISAY with STACY ABRAMSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``The Alabama Hotel, the Comet, and the Uncle Sam
House,'' recites a character in Joseph Mitchell's 1940 profile
``Mazie,'' in The New Yorker, ``the Dandy, the Defender, the
Niagara, the Owl, the Victoria House and the Grand Windsor Hotel,
the Houston, the Mascot, the Palace, the Progress, the Palma House
and the White House Hotel, the Newport, the Crystal, the Lion and
the Marathon. All flophouses. All on the Bowery. Each and all my
home, sweet home.''
</P>
<P>
   From the late 1900s through the middle of this century, dozens
of flophouses _ the polite term is ``lodging house'' _ lined the
Bowery, housing tens of thousands of men each night. There were no
flophouses for women.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the Bowery reigned as the world's most infamous
skid row. Jammed with barber schools and bars, cheap hotels and
missions, it was a mecca for men with nowhere else to go.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the barber schools are gone. Al's, the last rummy bar on
the Bowery, closed in 1993. Only a handful of old-time flops still
remain: the White House, the Palace, the Sunshine, the World, the
Andrews, the Prince, the Sun, the Grand and the Providence.
</P>
<P>
   They offer the cheapest housing in the city _ cubicles the size
of prison cells (4 by 6 feet, 7 feet high) with just a bed, a
locker, a bare dangling bulb and a chicken-wire ceiling _ for as
little as $4.50 a night. (Residents call them ``chicken coops'' or
``pigeon cages.'')
</P>
<P>
   Bowery lodging houses, which were typically walkups with a bar
on the ground floor, have been in steady decline since the end of
World War II. A 1955 change in the city's Housing Code prohibited
construction of new for-profit flops. The homeless spread to other
parts of the city; gentrification on the Bowery priced out the
poor.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a couple of old flops around Canal Street have been
bought up by a businessman from China, Willie Su, and cater mostly
to recently arrived Chinese immigrants. Most of the rest have been
in the same extended family for generations.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunshine at 241 Bowery, between Prince and Stanton streets,
was opened in the 1920s in a former pickle factory by a broom
maker, Frank Mazzara, who followed his brother-in-law Mike Gatto
into the lodging house business. Gatto's son Mike (Big Mike) Gatto
still runs the Andrews Hotel; his grandson Mike (Little Mike) Gatto
operates the Prince.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzara's son Carl took over the Sunshine in 1946 and ran it
until he retired in 1984, when he sold it to the owners of Bari
Restaurant and Pizzeria Equipment, on the ground floor, who said
they took over the hotel so they would not have to move their
inventory of used pizza ovens.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we opened this up, the Sunshine was a hotel for gandy
dancers,'' Carl Mazzara, 78, said, using the term for itinerant
railroad workers. ``In the summertime the railroads would come down
to the Bowery and hire the guys to lay tracks and spread gravel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed my life on the Bowery,'' he went on. ``I would
always take care of my men like they were my brothers. Many of
these guys had families that didn't take care of them. When a guy
died, I'd deal with the undertaker. When they got sick, I'd visit
them in the hospital. It was always an interesting place to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Up a steep flight of stairs, the Sunshine is home to an
isolated, self-contained society of 150 men. It is a chaotic,
bizarre, depressing and fascinating place.
</P>
<P>
   Flops have always been havens for loners. Some residents of the
Sunshine go for weeks without leaving their cubicles, relying on
the hotel's ``runner'' to bring them food and cash their government
checks. There are drug addicts, ex-cons, mental patients, old men
dumped by their families, Bowery old-timers. These are some of
their stories:
</P>
<P>
   As the manager of the Sunshine Hotel, Nathan Smith (Cubicle 38A)
keeps the place running. Officially, Smith works behind the cage in
the lobby from 5 a.m. to noon Saturday through Thursday _ checking
tenants in and out, answering the hotel's lone telephone with his
signature smoky-voiced ``Suuunshiiiine _ give me a 10-4,'' handing
out toilet paper, chain-smoking and telling endless looping tales
about his life to anyone who will listen.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is really on call 24 hours a day, every day. Tenants knock
on his cubicle door at 3 a.m. when they're not feeling well; they
pull him out of the shower to help them fill out a form, they
interrupt his guitar practice to ask him to change a light bulb.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who grew up in Bedford-Stuyvesant, says he ended up on
the Bowery sometime in the 1970s, after losing his bank job and his
wife, both on the same day. He has been manager of the Sunshine for
12 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an `eat it and beat it' hotel _ people are supposed to
come in and stay for a day or two and get out. But for some reason,
people like it here and they stay, for years. We don't have any
amenities here at all _ no soap, no towels, no TVs, no maid
service. The only thing you get is a light bulb and a locker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people call here thinking this is a luxury hotel.
When they come upstairs and see the joint, they run out screaming.
The Waldorf-Astoria we're not, but it beats living in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hotel probably looks about the same in 1998 as it did in
1928. It's just the people that have changed. When I first came on
the Bowery we used to get doctors, lawyers, engineers, the whole
nine yards. They had a streak of bad luck, or the wife left, or the
wife died and they ended up here. It was the cheapest place you
could stay. Mostly alcoholics then, mostly Caucasian. But over a
period of time, the demographics shifted, and they were replaced by
the younger kids and the drug addicts we've got now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly, I get along with everybody. I've had 'em all here,
from a priest to a murderer. We've had two Jesus Christs since I've
been at the Sunshine. Long white beard, robe, sandals. The whole
nine yards. One of them used to live right there in 2A. He was so
entrenched in his Jesus thing that he used to feed the mice, the
roaches, the rats, everything. Finally I had to throw him out. I
told him: `Jesus, you're a nice guy, but Jesus, I got to put you
out, buddy. You're making a health hazard here!'
</P>
<P>
   ``My most famous tenant was the cannibal Daniel Rakowitz. Very
nice guy. A little weird. He lived right there. One day I knocked
on his door and I saw he had a cage with 27 gerbils. I said, `Rack,
baby' _ that's what I called him _ I said: `Rack, baby, this is not
going to work. Me and you are good friends, buddy, but you're going
to have to leave.' Next thing I know he's serving a girl in a stew
to the homeless in Tompkins Square Park. But he was a down dude _ a
very nice guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, they can be murderers or whatever, they're all right
with me. We've always had different people here. Different people
go with the territory. This hotel is the last stop. A way station
for the flotsam and jetsam of humanity. A place where guys can live
cheap until they get back on their feet. I've learned quite a few
things here, particularly about tolerance. And I've learned to
respect people.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's time for me to get out of here. I'm looking forward
to the day that I can fly away like Superman _ because I'm not
Father Flanagan and this is not Boys Town. This is the Sunshine
Hotel at 241 Bowery _ and if you've got $10, I'll sell you a
room!''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The hotel's afternoon clerk, Vic K. (Cubicle BF) has lived on
the Bowery since 1961, when he arrived from his hometown,
Youngstown, Ohio. A private man, he spends much of his time
indulging in his vices: ``drinking, daydreaming and the horses.''
He also paints, writes and reads philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a loner, a dreamer. My mother was an
alcoholic, my father was something of a tyrant, and I just never
fit in. So I moved here. I started off with these crazy, soaring
ambitions of figuring out everything. I was on that old, impossible
quest for `truth' _ like that song `What's It All About, Alfie?'
Who hasn't wondered what it's all about? I was reading Lao-tze _
beautiful! lucid! _ and Emerson. I had some fierce, crazy ambitions
about learning how to think _ how to really think.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first it seemed like I was making some progress; it was
intoxicating. But I underestimated the complexity of the whole
affair. For every little answer I found, 10 new questions would
open up.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while it just started to seem like some crazy pipe
dream. I figured there'd been a lot more substantial heavyweights
by far than me through history, and they didn't seem to come up
with the `big answers' _ so where did I get off thinking I could?
</P>
<P>
   ``I became disillusioned. I started drinking. And here I am all
these years later. Nothing remotely heroic. Sorry I'm not more
loquacious _ maybe I feel like I don't have anything to be proud
of. It seems like one of those stories better left untold.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Davis (Cubicle 4L) is the main ``runner'' at the Sunshine
_ running errands for other residents for dollar tips.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways the Sunshine operates as a sealed-in society, with
its own culture and economy. Residents rely on one another to
survive. Almost anything can be bought through the Sunshine's
underground economy. There are a hotel loan shark and drug dealer;
there are tenants who do other tenants' laundry or clean their
cubicles for tips.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Davis, who says he is a Vietnam veteran and
runs his errands with the intensity of a soldier in combat. He sees
each run _ most are for cigarettes and beer _ as a life-and-death
struggle, a holy mission fraught with intrigue and danger.
</P>
<P>
   Davis says he came to the Sunshine nine years ago on the run
from the law down South. From morning until night, he sits in the
lobby cross-legged and still until, roused by a shout of his name
from a cubicle, he flies into action. Davis earns about $20 a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making a run takes constant concentration and constant
alertness. The main thing is: Do the steps. You get a run, and
there are three things you got to do: One, remember the order. Two,
remember who gave you the money. Three, remember how much they gave
you _ you've got to remember how much they gave you! And walking
all the time, you've got people constantly distracting you _
distraction's your biggest enemy! You've got to keep the order
going around in your mind the whole time. It's a work of constant
concentration.
</P>
<P>
   ``And very dangerous. A war zone. You have to realize you're in
the hustlers' capital of the planet. You got to constantly be using
your brain. Always on guard. Always ready to defend the money _
mentally and physically. You got other people's money on you. You
got to defend it better than you would your own because that's your
livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get to the store _ you've got to stay on guard. The store
clerks will try to hustle you. Remember, you're up in mental
activity against some of the best in mental activity. You've got to
stay on your toes! There's no such thing as cobwebs _ you've got to
apply yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a lot of adventures. But you know what my best
adventures were? Problem-solving. It's an adventure to go out in
this damn jungle and solve these problems for these guys. I've had
some real lulus, and I've done some good jobs on them. Those were
my best runs _ problem-solving. Think about it: Out of all the
stores in New York City you got one item to get in one store _ how
you going to figure out where to go? You use your senses and figure
out the trails. I have actually solved some problems I don't think
anybody else could have solved. It's quite an experience out here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this as the beginning level of the high-intensity
financial life of New York City. I've been doing this for eight
years now. No mistakes allowed. Totally honest reputation. My
reputation is my business. You blow it once, you could ruin your
career. I don't blow it. I don't blow it!''
</P>
<P>
   Talk around the Sunshine is that Vincent Giganti (Cubicle 25A)
is a relative of Vincent (Chin) Gigante. The family apparently
changed the spelling of the name in 1957 after Vincent (Chin)
Gigante was charged _ and later acquitted _ in the bungled shooting
of a Genovese crime family associate, Frank Costello.
</P>
<P>
   A heroin addict now on methadone, Giganti has lived at the
Sunshine since 1990. He spends most days in his cubicle taking care
of his two lovebirds, Pretty Boy and Little Bit. He has throat
cancer and speaks with a mechanical voice box.
</P>
<P>
   ``I moved into the Sunshine eight years ago because there was no
place else to go. I was addicted to heroin and didn't want to
bother my family anymore. I've been here ever since and I'll be
here until I die, probably. I'm a junkie, understand. Started using
drugs in Vietnam. Never thought I was going to come home but I
made it. When I came back, nothing was the same. Couldn't put my
finger on it, but I had changed completely. A new person. It took
me about 12 months to go to prison, and from there everything's
been downhill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a flophouse, but at least I have my own little room.
That's what counts. I can close my door, watch TV. And I've got my
babies. Without them I never would have made it in this place. This
is Pretty Boy, he's 10. This is Little Bit, he's 5. He's a devil,
yes you are! These are my friends. All they do, all night and day,
is bring me happiness. If it wasn't for these birds I wouldn't have
made it in this place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in like a time zone in here, a dead zone. Every day is the
same: I get up in the morning. An hour later I get my bottle, my
pint of vodka, and then I fall out. I get up in the afternoon and
get something to eat, and then drink some more. And it's just like
I'm dead. Nothing's ever going to change. I'm just dead in the
water.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 15, a friend of mine had a car and we rode by here
_ this same hotel _ and we had these rolls of pennies. And this guy
that was in the car with us said, `Let's throw the money and watch
the bums run for it!' And we stopped the car and threw the money,
and the bums started running, grabbing the pennies. We thought it
was so funny. And God forbid, I knew I'd end up in this same damn
place. This is what kills me _ I think of it every day. I guess God
has a way of letting us get what we deserve.''

   Anthony Coppola (Cubicle 4B) is literally eating himself into
confinement. He can barely squeeze through his door and rarely
leaves his bedbug-infested cubicle. His body is covered with red,
infected sores. While other tenants complain about his cubicle's
smells, Coppola is still one of the Sunshine's most popular
residents, looked after by many of the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost my mother when I was only 4. The judge took me away
from my father when I was 5, and I was a ward of New York state
until I was 19. Then I came down to the Bowery. Been here 20 years
now. I'm what you call one of the survivors down here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I weigh 425 pounds. You wouldn't know it because I
carry my weight very well. When I first came down to the Bowery I
was a normal-sized person. Then I started putting on weight, mainly
because of self-esteem, depression. After a while I didn't go
outside anymore. Now I just stay in my room and eat. Sometimes I
knock off a 26-ounce can of Chef Boy-ar-dee ravioli. That's for
five people in the family, and I'll be eating it cold right out of
the can. That is a load of eats!
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't go nowhere anymore because I ain't got no clothes. See
that pair of pants? It's been hanging there for two years. Don't
fit anymore. Cuts off the circulation. So I wear a sheet, like a
toga. Old green sheet, very dirty. I'm pretty comfortable in my
sheet. I live with it. Anyway, why should I go anywhere? If I want
air, I just turn on my fan a little higher and I got air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to leave this place. Not yet. It's too much like
home. You been in a place such a long time, people get to be like
family, you don't want to leave. Like Nathan, the manager. I
adopted him. I call him Pop. He's like a father to me, and who in
their right mind would leave their father alone when their father's
getting a little older? Me and him will grow old together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of the sweetest guys here. Ask anyone who knows me _
nice guy, never a problem. I'm one of the biggest, gentlest giants
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Nate Smith called Paul Donoghue ``the only deaf-mute crack
addict on the Bowery.'' Before he left to live in a home for the
deaf, Donoghue slept in Bed 157 in one of the Sunshine's three
barrackslike dorms for five years, earning money handing out
sign-language alphabet cards on the subway.
</P>
<P>
   He struck up a friendship with Joseph Braddy, 50, a former
psychology major and substance-abuse counselor who had finished an
11-year sentence for drug dealing and slept in Bed 42. Braddy
taught himself sign language so he could communicate better with
his friend.
</P>
<P>
   In February, before he was arrested again on drug charges,
Braddy talked about Donoghue: ``If you get close to Paul, he'll
talk about what he feels inside. Most people hide their feelings
but Paul's different, he's like a brother. I would never let
anything happen to him. I would kill for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Donoghue grunted and signed to Braddy, who interpreted: ``He
says I'm his heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Max R. (Cubicle 1L), a 30-year-old Russian immigrant architect,
said he left his wife and two children in New Jersey last November
to go off, once again, on a crack and heroin binge. His cubicle is
unlike any other at the Sunshine. Lighted by candles, decorated
with postcards, a stack of art books on the floor, it almost feels
peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I saw this place, it just blew me away. I had
no idea that stuff like this was still possible _ people living in
cubicles. The hotel has 18-foot ceilings, and the cubicles are only
7 feet high with chicken wire on top, so it reminds me of the way
cattle is kept _ like cages. The rooms are 4 by 6, built in rows
down a corridor. There's a bed _ the bed takes a little more than
half the space _ two shelves and a light bulb overhead. That's it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Completely unsanitary. There's dirt and bedbugs. Crack is sold
freely. It's noisy 20 hours a day. There's no calm, no peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese, for lack of space, created little cubicles where
you could spend the night. But they were well designed: there was
no noise coming through, and a person could be with himself. Here
it's impossible to be alone with yourself. It's just mystifying to
me that places like this still exist. Everyone should experience
living like this just to know what's still possible in society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people just lay on their bed all day in their
cubicle watching TV or listening to the radio or staring into space
or sleeping. They just keep vegetating in these little cells with
the fluorescent light coming through the chicken wire overhead, and
that's their life. They get deeper and deeper into it until they
fall to complete bottom within themselves. They may not look any
different from the outside, but their spirit is destroyed. I see it
every time I look at the guys who've been here for 11, 12, 15 years
_ and they're still here. It seems normal to them. This place is
deadly.
</P>
<P>
   ``On my wall there's a painting of Duerer's Saint Jerome. He was
a hermit who went to the desert and lived by himself to try to seek
knowledge and achieve illumination by detaching himself from the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, that's what I'm doing here, I guess. This, for me,
is a break from society, from reality. A chance to get away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had responsibilities and work and family and people that
depended on me. Here I don't have to do anything for anyone. No one
knows I'm here. I can just take a break and indulge to the maximum
without being worried about what anyone's going to say or how I'm
going to affect others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's grotesque, and I enjoy it. It's like that movie, `The
Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover,' just in the way that
their experience was so disgusting, so grotesque, but they made an
art out of it. In the same way, I'm kind of making an art out of
experiencing this.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days after he was interviewed in mid-February, Max R. was
arrested at the Sunshine on charges that he shoplifted a lamp from
a lighting store on the Bowery.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means his room is available if anybody wants to rent
it,'' Smith said with a shrug from behind his cage in the lobby.
``He's just a clean-out now. Nothing personal. I'm going to clean
him out and sell his room. Immediately if not sooner.''
