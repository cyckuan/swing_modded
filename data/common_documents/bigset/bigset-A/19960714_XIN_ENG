TEHRAN, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Three people were killed and two
injured Friday in the collapse of a suspended bridge in Isfahan,
central Iran, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Persian evening daily Kayhan said that the incident took
place in the Zaman Khan bridge on the outskirts of Shahr Kurd.
</P>
<P>
Local experts attributed the collapse of the bridge to its old
age and poor maintenance.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said that the bridge caved in when the metal
cables which held it severed.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the death toll might rise as there were a large
number of people walking over it when the incident
happened.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu
Ciller is expected to pay a two-day official visit to Dublin next
week at the invitation of her Irish counterpart Dick Spring.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Turkish Foreign Ministry said today
that Ciller, also deputy prime minister in the newly formed
coalition government between her center-right True Path Party
(DYP) and pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) led by Necmettin Erbakan,
will become the first Turkish foreign minister to pay an official
visit to Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"The talks to be held during the visit will deal with
bilateral ties and also on issues related to the European Union,"
it said.
</P>
<P>
Ciller is expected to reassure the Europeans that her
government alliance with Islamists, will not alter Turkey's
promises and obligations toward the EU.
</P>
<P>
During the election campaign last December, Prime Minister
Erbakan said he would review Turkey's ties with the EU and
strengthen its relations with the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
But in the government program last week, Erbakan declared
the new coalition would maintain close links with the Western
countries including the EU.

<HEADLINE> Arab Foreign Ministers Hold Meeting on Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the eight
Damascus Declaration members states met in the Omani capital of
Muscat today to discuss the Middle East peace process and
counter-terrorism measures.
</P>
<P>
The 13th meeting of the Damascus Declaration members was
presided over by Omani Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Yusef
Ben Alawi, reports reaching here from Muscat said.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting, which is expected to stress the Arabs'
adherence to an overall and comprehensive peace as the strategic
option in the region, are the foreign ministers of Egypt, Syria
and the six countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).
</P>
<P>
"Arabs entered negotiations with Israel in accordance with the
land-for-peace principle and relevant U.N. Security Council
resolutions," Alawi said.
</P>
<P>
The repeated hardline statements of not committing to the
land-for-peace formula by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on the peace process have triggered outcries in the Arab
world.
</P>
<P>
The Arab countries have taken a series of measures to cope with
the situation by rallying Arab ranks and calling for international
support.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also deal with terrorism, which Alawi
described as "the most dangerous phenomenon menacing our
contemporary history."
</P>
<P>
He called for a pan-Arab cooperation to tackle and get rid of
terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain and
the United Arab Emirates. The Damascus Declaration is a pact
reached following the 1991 Gulf War, under which Egypt and Syria
would provide troops to guarantee the security of the oil-rich but
manpower-poor GCC members.
</P>
<P>
Security is a top concern in the region. Last month a bombing
attack killed 19 Americans in eastern Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also are expected to discuss Syria's mediating
efforts between Iran and Bahrain, which blames Tehran for 19
months of unrest in the country.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Trade with African States Facing Obstacles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The annual volume of Egypt's trade
with other African countries is about 300 to 400 million Egyptian
pounds (88.2 to 117.6 million U.S. dollars), which account for
only 1 percent of Egypt's total volume of foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
The main obstacle facing Egypt's trade with African countries
is the lack of regular navigation lines that link Egyptian ports
to East and West Africa, the Egyptian Middle East News Agency
(MENA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
This makes the cost of sea and air freight higher, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
The comparatively small volume of trade with African states is
also due to poor promotion of Egyptian commodities in African
markets and the absence of standing connections between Egyptian
producers and African importers, MENA noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the eight
Damascus Declaration members states ended their first working
session this evening in the Omani capital of Muscat, reports
reaching here from the Gulf state said.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing session endorsed an agenda for the 13th
ministerial meeting of the Damascus Declaration members states,
which is scheduled to last for two days.
</P>
<P>
The ministers, who have discussed the latest developments of the
Middle East peace process and counter-terrorism measures, will
hold a closed working session tonight.
</P>
<P>
The 13th meeting of the Damascus Declaration members was
presided over by Omani Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Yusef
Ben Alawi, who said the endorsed agenda includes a number of
topics, mainly a joint Arab action document, issues of security
and stability to the declaration's member states.
</P>
<P>
The participants -- the foreign ministers of Egypt, Syria and
the six countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) -- also
stressed the Arabs' adherence to an overall and comprehensive
peace as the strategic option in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Arabs entered negotiations with Israel in accordance with the
land-for-peace principle and relevant U.N. Security Council
resolutions," Alawi said.
</P>
<P>
This was part of the efforts the Arab countries have made to
cope with the new situation following repeated hardline statements
of not committing to the land-for-peace formula by Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who came to power after the May 29
elections in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Arab countries have made enormous efforts to rally Arab
ranks, calling for support from the international community,
especially the United States.
</P>
<P>
Terrorism is another focus of the meeting, which Alawi
described as "the most dangerous phenomenon menacing our
contemporary history."

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
will visit Russia Monday on part of his diplomatic efforts to
protect the Middle East peace process, the Middle East News Agency
(MENA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister will deliver a message from President
Hosni Mubarak to Russian President Boris Yeltsin and hold talks
with his Russian counterpart Yevgeny Primakov, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Moscow, Moussa will underscore the exigency
of commitment to the land-for-peace principle set out by the
Madrid peace conference in 1991 and the relevant U.N. resolutions
which call for an Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab land.
</P>
<P>
His visit comes prior to Mubarak's visit to the United States,
slated for the end of July to balance the Egyptian endeavour to
shore up the peace.
</P>
<P>
Moussa will underline the Russian and European role in the
Middle East peace process and urge them to make more efforts to
revitalize the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Russia, a sponsor of the Middle East peace process, has
reiterated that the great achievements made over the past years
since the Madrid peace conference should be maintained.
</P>
<P>
Russia has also said it is ready to make constructive
contributions to pushing forward the peace march and creating the
common ground for improving the atmosphere in the region so that
the stalled negotiations would re-start.
</P>
<P>
Moussa is also expected to review means of promoting
cooperation between Egypt and Russia, MENA said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government is keen to expand trade with Egypt, which
stands now at 350 million U.S. dollars, MENA added.

BEIRUT, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz received a letter from U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher on a five-state cease-fire monitoring committee in

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Parliament Calls for National Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwait Parliament today
called on the government to draft a national defense strategy for
the coming 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Members of the National Assembly made this call at a
secret meeting which discussed a military report of the Fact
Finding Committee on the 1990 Iraqi aggression against Kuwait,
official sources said.
</P>
<P>
The session, which was boycotted by 16 members in the
50-member parliament in protest against holding the meeting
behind closed doors, also suggested a need to redefine the
task and jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defense in determining
arms purchase and military infrastructure needs.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentarians also called for coordination among Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) states to set a Gulf defense formula
aimed at coping with the variables in the region.
</P>
<P>
In March 1994, the Kuwaiti parliament approved a defense budget
estimated at 12 billion U.S. dollars for military build-up in a
period of 12 years beginning from 1992.
</P>
<P>
Most of the funds was earmarked for replacing the weapons and
equipment Kuwait's tiny military lost when Iraqis invaded in
August 1990 and occupied the Emirate for seven months before they
were driven out by the coalition forces headed by the United
States.
</P>
<P>
For the past several years, Kuwait has purchased a large
quantity of sophisticated weapons from the U.S., Britain and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has signed 10-year defense agreements with the United
States, Britain, France and Russia since it was liberated in
1991. These agreements stipulate weapons purchase, among other
things.
</P>
<P>
The members of the parliament did not give their concrete
recommendations relating to the proposed new defense strategy, the
sources said.

BAGHDAD, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the
Organization of the Arab Societies of the Red Crescent and Red
Cross, Abdul-Ghani Ghani Akshi, has appealed to the United Nations
to permit the Iraqi airplanes to carry Iraqi patients to and from
Baghdad for treatment.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal in a letter to Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdul-Meguid and Chairman of the Executive Office of the
Arab Health Ministers Mohammed Abdul-Rahman al-Midfamr.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Akshi asked for permission of the United Nations
for transferring the sick people by air for medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
The six years of U.N. trade embargo imposed on Iraq for its
1990 invasion of Kuwait has resulted in an acute dearth of medical
supplies in Iraq and a high mortality rate of children, women and
the elderly who are vulnerable to the deteriorating health status
in the country.

DHAKA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The members of parliament of the
opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) returned to the
inaugural session of the seventh parliament about one hour after
their walkout this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The BNP MPs led by its chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia left the

refusal of moving an adjournment motion raised by two BNP MPs
before the election of the new speaker and the deputy speaker.

However, after one-hour break after the election of the new
speaker and the deputy speaker, the BNP MPs returned to the house

<P>
Speaking on the occasion, some BNP MPs also felicitated the new
speaker and the deputy speaker, saying that "much depends on the
speaker to make the parliament an effective and lively house to
realize the hopes and aspirations of the nation who won
independence at the cost of millions lives."
</P>
<P>
But they also criticized the contention of the treasury bench
to call the present government as the consensus government. "The
government of consensus is nowhere in the politico-constitutional
dictionary," a BNP MP said.

<HEADLINE> Qatari Emir in Jeddah for Talks with King Fahd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin
Khalifa al-Thani arrived in Jeddah today for a short visit to
Saudi Arabia to hold talks with the King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz on a
settlement of the long-time border dispute between Qatar and
Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hamad's visit was aimed at holding talks with King Fahd
in line with Riyadh's efforts to solve the Qatari-Bahraini border
dispute, according to reports of local Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
This is the result of contacts and consultations held during
the last few days among officials from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
Qatar and Bahrain which brought forth an agreement that
high-level delegations would head to Saudi Arabia to meet King
Fahd within the Saudi efforts to resolve the border dispute
between the two countries, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have been locked in a border dispute over a
number of potentially gas-rich islands which have been in
Bahrain's control since the 1930s. Saudi Arabia has been
mediating between the two countries since 1978, but the results
have been fruitless so far.
</P>
<P>
Both Qatar and Bahrain are members of Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC), which also includes Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab
Emirates and Oman. The regional organization, which was set up 15
years ago, is a political, economic and military cooperation group.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia's mediation between Qatar and Bahrain was upon the
request of the two countries, reports said.
</P>
<P>
On June 7, Qatar turned down a Bahraini request to withdraw the
border dispute from the Hague-based International Court of
Justice, saying that it would only agree to the Bahraini request
if Saudi Arabia comes up with a fair compromise.
</P>
<P>
The issue was lodged with the court on the basis of an
agreement signed by Qatar, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Qatar unilaterally asked the international arbitrary body to
settle the problem in 1991. But Bahrain has refused to accept the
jurisdiction of the court, which decided in January that it had
jurisdiction over the dispute and is expected to produce a ruling
within this year.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hamad's trip to Saudi Arabia is the second to the
Kingdom since he took power on June 1995.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's gross domestic product
(GDP) is estimated to record a 6.7 percent growth in the upcoming
1996-97 fiscal year starting from July 16, Finance Minister Ram
Sharan Mahat said today.
</P>
<P>
Testifying at the National Assembly, or upper house, today,
Mahat said the economic statistics of the current fiscal year
showed that this projected economic growth for the new fiscal year
was realistic.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the government's budget plan for 1996-97 was
a reflection of the country's present economic condition.
</P>
<P>
The budget, announced last Wednesday, allocated more than half
of the total government expenditure of 57.6 billion rupees (over 1
billion US dollars) for the development purpose, nearly 33 percent
up from that of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's economic growth in the current fiscal year is 6.1
percent against 2.6 percent last year, according to an economic
survey recently issued by the government.
</P>
<P>
The industrial sector of the country recorded an increase of
4.9 percent in its income during the past 10 months, Mahat told
the upper house today, adding that the government had given
priority to a long-term agriculture plan and increased investment
in the agricultural sector by 34 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Macao's first film, "The Temptation
of a Big Braid," which was shot by Chinese film-makers in Macao,
made its debut here tonight.
</P>
<P>
The film, a romance between a young man of Portuguese origin
and a local Chinese girl in Macao in the 1930s, marked the
beginning of the film-making industry in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Based on a novel by a local Portuguese writer, the film has
won wide appraisal when it was on show in Beijing and Shanghai as
well as in Lisbon earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Film critics say that the film depicts the process from
clashes to compromise between western culture and Chinese culture.
</P>
<P>
Officials praised it as vividly representing the long-term
friendship between the Portuguese people and the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The film was starred by Ning Jing, a well-known Chinese young
actress, and Ricardo Carrico, a young star of Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Cai Yuanyuan, director of the film and also deputy general
manager of the Cai Brothers Film-Making Studio, said that he will
try to make more films on Macao.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Macao Film Association was founded last
Saturday, aiming at promoting the film-making industry in Macao.

<HEADLINE> New Chinese Hero, Ding Defu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Correspondents from Xinhua and the
People's Daily have discovered a new socialist hero who is loyal
to the country and have written a lengthy article calling on
people to learn from the man.
</P>
<P>
Ding Defu is the political commissar of the Ngari Military Area
in the Tibet Autonomous Region who served in that post on the
frigid plateau for 25 years, until July of 1994.
</P>
<P>
Ding was said to be a qualified officer who had tried his best
to improve soldiers' living conditions, serve the local people,
and combat corruption, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
One example cited was that one spring when Ding was taking 200
new soldiers to a camp, they encountered 12 trucks blocked by a
river of ice en route, created by an avalanche.
</P>
<P>
The situation was dangerous because of the possibility of
another one happening. Ding immediately jumped into the formidable
river and directed the truck team in crossing the water.
</P>
<P>
"Ding stood in the icy river for eight hours," the article
says, adding that, whenever Ding involved himself in dangerous
activities, he left a final message for his family members.
</P>
<P>
One day when his daughter saw one of these messages, she begged
her father not to go to the mountains. Ding calmed her, saying,
"No. daddy is a Party member and a senior officer. It would be
glorious if I were to die on the plateau. But if I lose one inch
of national territory, daddy will be guilty, and condemned by
history."
</P>
<P>
The article went on to tell moving stories of how the generous
commissar donated blood to help comrades, refused to accept
bribes, and helped local farmers with their crops.
</P>
<P>
Ding's health was ruined because of his hard work and had to
leave Tibet. He has been nominated as an excellent Party worker by
the army and the government.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China has had major campaigns to tell stories
about citizens who have served the nation wholeheartedly,
and urge the people to learn from these socialist models. This is
believed to be a move to help improve people's spiritual lives and
moral standards.
</P>
<P>
Among these heroes, the most well-known is Kong Fansen, a cadre
who also worked in Tibet and died there.

<P>
DALIAN, July 14 (Xinhua) -- League leader Dalian Wanda scored a
comfortable 4-1 victory over Shanghai Shenhua in the first leg of
the Chinese Soccer Association (CSA) Cup quarter-finals here on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The defending league champion Shenhua, also runners-up in last
year's CSA Cup, was now the second placer following Wanda in this
year's league, which laid off in late June after its first round
robin competition.
</P>
<P>
But Dalian Wanda, with the advantage of home turf, dominated
the match throughout and gave few chances to the visitors.
</P>
<P>
Wang Tao opened the account with a brilliant long blast after
teammate Xu Hui passed a free kick to him, giving Dalian a 1-0
lead only seven minutes into action.
</P>
<P>
Shenhua managed to level the score in the 25th minute when a
header from Qi Hong flew over Wanda's goalie and went into the
goal.
</P>
<P>
Swiss Patrik Svensson put Wanda ahead again in 38th minute and
gave Wanda a 2-1 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
Now came a one-sided second half. Xu Hui breached Shenhua's
defence by netting a cross in the box in the 47th minute and
captain Xu Hong sealed the victory for Wanda with a penalty goal
with seven minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesay, the two sides will play their second leg in
Shanghai, where Shenhua played a goalless draw with touring Wanda
in the 10th round of Chinese league on June 16.
</P>
<P>
In the day's other matches, defending CSA Cup champion Jinan
Taishan kept its winning momentum to beat hosts Guangzhou Songri
2-1 in Guangzhou, Sichuan Quanxing blanked the touring Beijing
Guo'an 2-0 in Chengdu and Guangdong Hongyuan was held to a 1-1
draw by hosts Shanghai Pudong, who was the only team from Division
B in the top eight.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Send Holbrooke to Promote Bosnian Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Richard Holbrooke, the former
U.S. chief negotiator in the former Yugoslavia, will return to the
Balkans to convince Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to live
up to the Dayton peace accord, a senior government official said
today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was reached on Friday at a White House meeting of
U.S. President Bill Clinton's senior national security advisers
after a recommendation by Secretary of State Warren Christopher,
according to the New York Times report.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke, who brokered the agreement to end the nearly four
years of bloody war in Bosnia last November, resigned in late
February.
</P>
<P>
The former U.S. Balkan envoy will leave on Monday for Belgrade,
and later will go to the capitals of Bosnia and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
His main task is to persuade Milosevic to help remove Bosnian
Serb political leader Radovan Karadzic and military commander
Ratko Mladic from power and facilitate their arrest, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week the International War Crimes Tribunal at The
Hague issued arrest warrants for both men, who have been twice
indicted on charges of war crimes.
</P>
<P>
The two Bosnian Serb leaders are regarded by the Western powers
as the main obstacle to the Bosnian elections scheduled for
mid-September which are believed to be critical to the future of
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The United States and its western allies have repeatedly
threatened that they would reimpose tough economic sanctions on
Serbia if Milosevic failed to fulfill his promises on insuring
that the two Bosnian Serb leaders are removed from power and
arrested.
</P>
<P>
But the Clinton administration has still not given Holbrooke
specific instructions on whether the United States is prepared to
move forward immediately with new sanctions against Serbia, the
official said.

<HEADLINE> Karpov, Kasparov to Hold Match Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 14 (Xinhua) -- International Chess Federation
(ICF) world champion Anatoly Karpov and his arch rival Garry
Kasparov were reportedly to meet in a match next year, with prize
money totalling at least two million U.S. dollars, reports said
here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
With the benefit of 23 years of experience, Russian Karpov, 45,
is an old hand at chess championships. He fought off young US
challenger Gata Kamsky in the ICF final battled out in June and
early July in Elista, Russia.
</P>
<P>
But Karpov still dreams of exacting revenge against his fellow
countryman Kasparov, 33, who is reigning Professional Chess
Association world champion.
</P>
<P>
Eleven years ago, Kasparov put an end to Karpov's 10 years'
domination in the world of chess when at the age of 22, and became
the youngest world champion in the game's history.

<HEADLINE> China's First Sci-Fi Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Science fiction was long derided
in China and had few followers, in contrast to the attitude in the
West, where it had wide popularity.
</P>
<P>
Some scholars said that this was partly due to the fact that
most Chinese tended to pay more attention to their present life,
rather than some vague future event. Whatever the case, that has
now changed. as China opened its first science fiction festival
here today to point to the progress that has been in the genre.
</P>
<P>
The festival is the work of the Science Literature Committee of
the Popular Science Writers' Association of China and Science
Fiction World magazine. It attracted writers and fans by the
hundreds from across the country.
</P>
<P>
People who know little about Sci-Fi's popularity in the West
can attend Sci-Fi seminars, book exhibitions, and film and TV
viewings.
</P>
<P>
Since the country opened its door wide to the outside world in
the late 1970s, its science and technology have kept advancing,
some people, especially the young, have been getting more
interested in "strange things" like robots, remote solar systems,
and time machines, Song Yicang, a writer attending today's
gathering.
</P>
<P>
In the drive to achieve economic greatness by using technology,
the Chinese government has also used Sci-Fi to spread scientific
knowledge and to "arm the common people".
</P>
<P>
At the festival's opening, Jin Tao, an official from the
Popular Science Writers' Association, announced the establishment
of a Sci-Fi research group by the association to encourage and
oversee the "healthy development of the genre".
</P>
<P>
China now has a Sci-Fi magazine, Science Fiction World, which
has more than 200,000 subscribers, and dozens of local
associations have been created by fans in many cities. The country
even has a best-of-Sci-Fi award, the Galaxy Award, to honor short
stories every year.
</P>
<P>
China was the sponsor of the 1991 World Sci-Fi Year Conference
and is now preparing to translate some classic Sci-Fi novels from
the US and Britain after obtaining the copyright.
</P>
<P>
"But we should make a greater effort to produce our own Sci-Fi
novels, novellas and short stories, because China is a nation with
great imaginative power," said Tan Kai, deputy-editor-in-chief of
Science Fiction World.

<HEADLINE> China's Major Early Rice Expects Higher Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Jiangxi Province, the largest
exporter of rice in southeast China, has 1.36 million hectares of
early rice this year, 26,700 hectares more than last year, local
agricultural officials said.
</P>
<P>
Total output of its early rice is expected to be 6.5 billion
kilograms, one billion more than last year, they said.
</P>
<P>
Early rice output is expected to go up about 20 percent, they
added.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi has a population of 40 million and per capita
cultivated land of 0.85 mu (about 0.057 hectares), ranking first
in southeast China. Over one billion kilograms of grain produced
by the province are exported to coastal areas annually.
</P>
<P>
The province raised the price of grain this year in a bid to
encourage farmers. One hundred kilograms of unhusked paddy rice
goes for 140 to 150 yuan (16.8 to 18.1 US dollars), up 30 percent
over last year. Many farmers who had left the fields to look for
work elsewhere have returned to the farm fields.
</P>
<P>
Finding the planting of crops more profitable, many farmers
have turned cotton fields and mulberry tree plots into grain
fields, said Zhong, who is with the provincial rural work
committee.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several years, large tracts of grain fields in
the province were used for planting cash crops because of the low
price of grain.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
held talks today with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the
Middle East peace process, particularly on the Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
Arafat met Mubarak at an air base in Belbais, some 50
kilometers northeast of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders, together with Egyptian Minister of Defense and
Military Production Field Marshal Mohammed Hussein Tantawi,
attended a ceremony marking the graduation of a class of Egyptian
pilots at the Air Force Academy in Belbais.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Ambassador in Cairo Zuhdy al-Qedra said Saturday
that Arafat's visit falls within the context of constant
consultations between the two leaders as Egypt is the main
supporter of the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians are concerned that the hard-line policy of
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has put the peace
process in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has voiced opposition to resuming Arab-Israeli
negotiations on the principle of land-for-peace and to the
establishment of an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem
as its capital. The Palestinians have viewed their self-rule in
the Gaza Strip and West Bank as a step to statehood.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has also vowed to build new Jewish settlements in the
West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to make peace with Israel, has
been playing a role as a mediator in negotiations between Israel
and the Arabs, particularly the Palestinians.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's revenues collected by
the Central Board of Revenue (CBR) in the fiscal year of July
1995-June 1996 had amounted to 266.6 billion rupees (7.62 billion
US dollars), exceeding the target of 264.8 billion rupees (7.56
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here today, Chairman of the CBR
Alvi Abdul Rahim said that the tax collection was 5.6 billion
rupees (160 million dollars) higher than the downwardly revised
target of 261 billion rupees (7.46 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The actual target of revenue collections given to the board in
the budget for 1995-96 was to the tune of 270.5 billion rupees
(7.73 billion dollars), which was later revised by the cabinet in
the wake of withdrawal of customs and excise duty on furnace and
crude oil.
</P>
<P>
However, the sales tax registered a decline of 700 million
rupees (20 million dollars) in the collections, amounting to 49.8
billion rupees (1.42 billion dollars) against the target of 50.6
billion rupees (1.44 billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> 62 dead in Sweep Against Rwandan Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 14 (Xinhua) -- No less than 62 people were
killed last week when Rwanda's Tutsi-dominated army carried out
an operation against Hutu insurgents in the northwestern Gisenyi
Region bordering Zaire, said a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The report, Quoting western aid workers, said the killings
followed a search operation in the Gisenyi region, where the
majority Hutu population see Tutsi soldiers with suspicion.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of attacks by rebels operating from
refugee camps in neighbouring Zaire had provoked retaliation from
the Rwandan army, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The latest killings, on July 9 and 10, occurred in Karago and
Giciye villages -- an area heavily infiltrated by rebels, and the
home area of the late Hutu President Juvenal Habyarimana.
</P>
<P>
Local residents as saying that rebels tried to kill the Tutsi
Deputy Governor in the area on July 3, and the army moved in on
July 5. Many bodies were still lying in the area, said the report
quoting local residents.
</P>
<P>
Many rebel attacks have been directed at survivors of the 1994
genocide in an effort to prevent them from giving evidence
against those who directed the attacks in which up to a million
Tutsis and allied Hutus died.
</P>
<P>
The Head of the United Nations' Human Rights Office in Kigali,
Ian Martin, said observers of his office were probing the latest
killings in Gisenyi.
</P>
<P>
The Gisenyi killings coincided with a ``hearts and minds''
campaign launched by the Rwandan government, in which ministers
toured the area to urge the people not to co-operate with the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
Martin said up to 600 people who survived the 1994 genocide
had fled their homes in Gitarama, central Rwanda, after receiving
threats.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of 1996, the U.N. Human Rights Office
received reports of at least 98 attacks on genocide survivors.
The victims included local government officials and one mayor.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Men Urged To Practice Family Planning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 14 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian official called on more
men to practice family planning in a bid to bring the country's
fast growing population under control, today's Persian daily
Hamshahri reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Hussein Malek Afzali, President of Iran's
Family Planning Association, as saying in a seminar that Iran has
not achieved the desired success in family planning so far.
</P>
<P>
Despite the tremendous pressure from population growth, Iranian
men are still least involved in the nationwide family planning
program and their ratio stands at 15 percent only, the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
There are about 7.2 million Iranian people who use
contraceptive devices while two million rely on traditional birth
control methods, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that one third of pregnancies in the country are
unwanted or go against their wills.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted Afzali as saying that Iran has achieved
little success in the birth control though the government has
spent an average of 20 billion rials (about 5 million
U.S. dollars) annually on the sector.
</P>
<P>
Iran faces the danger of a population explosion as 25 million
youngsters under 17 are approaching the age of marriage.
</P>
<P>
In other words, 25 million youngsters mean 12.5 million
couples in the future. If each couple have two children, they will
add 25 million to the population.
</P>
<P>
Specialists warned that Iran's population would be doubled
in 20 or 25 years, thus naturally aggravating the conditions and
pressure upon the decision-makers.
</P>
<P>
The problem of the swelling population has seriously affected
the society in various fields ranging from economy, employment,
education to welfare and medical care.

LUSAKA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- African governments should learn to
solve their own economic problems as western countries are not
prepared to continue helping them any more.
</P>
<P>
This is the view of Samuel Asante, Senior Regional
Advisor to African governments in the United Nations Economic
Commission for Africa, Zambia News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the commemoration of the United Nations' 50th
anniversary here at the weekend, Asante said that time has come for
African leaders to start depending on their own resources and man
power for development because right now on not even the World Bank is
prepared to help Africa anymore.
</P>
<P>
Development in Africa is also being hindered by the fact that most
countries in the continent are in heavy debt, he added.
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, Asante said that African countries are still facing
the major challenge of development as they enter the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> More Zimbabwean Men Opt for Vasectomy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 14 (Xinhua) -- More Zimbabwean men are now
choosing vasectomy as an alternative form of contraception, says
the Zimbabwe National Family Planning Council (ZNFPC).
</P>
<P>
ZNFPC Service Delivery Coordinator Evelyn Muchirahondo told
the Zimbabwe National News Agency on Sunday that although more
men were opting for vasectomy, it was something they preferred
not to talk about.
</P>
<P>
''Men are now starting to understand what vasectomy is all
about because in the past most thought it was the same as
circumcision, but now the idea has caught on especially among the
elite,'' Muchirahondo said without giving figures.
</P>
<P>
She said the shift by most women from short term to long term
methods of family planning and the upsurge of new people using
contraceptives, showed that communication between couples had
improved and men now understood the advantages of having smaller
families.
</P>
<P>
She said ZNFPC would launch an education campaign next year
aimed at youths which will emphasize two way communication
between counsellors and young people over the problems they face.
</P>
<P>
''Our target now is the youth who are at a very difficult
period in their adult life and need to understand changes taking
place in their bodeies.
</P>
<P>
''We want them to have someone to talk to which is why we are
training counsellors," she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Environmentalists and wildlife
organizsations have welcomed the idea of ploughing by elephants
in communal areas in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
However, these organizations have called for a full scale
research on the subject before it is introduced, the Sunday Mail
reported today.
</P>
<P>
In separate interviews with the paper the groups hailed the
''productive utilization of wildlife'', which was in line with
the government policy of ''conservation through utilization''.
</P>
<P>
They said India had been using elephants for logging purposes for
centuries, asking "why not use our elephants for ploughing'' and boost
communal agriculturial production.
</P>
<P>
However, animal ecologists said more researches needed on the
African elephant, which they said was different from the Indian
one.
</P>
<P>
It was reported last week that the Imire Game Park has started
elephant ploughing. enditem

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scientists Create New Calorie-free Sweetener </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli scientists have
developed a new calorie-free sweetener 300 times sweeter than
natural sugar, The Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The new product, created by Hebrew University organic
chemists Professor Raphael Ikan, Dr. Bernard Crammer and Dr.
Vera Weinstein, will be presented at the International Symposium
on Sweeteners to open here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The sweetener is extracted from the plant Stevia rebaudiana,
which has been grown along the Paraguay-Uruguay border as well as
in the Hebrew University's Botanical Garden and in the Negev.
</P>
<P>
Use of the plan has been approved in the United States
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The researchers have invented a patented process for the
extraction and purification of the sweetening element steioside
from the plant, with the aim of going into commercial
development.
</P>
<P>
The symposium, to last through Friday, is sponsored by the
International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, Hebrew
University and the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities.
</P>
<P>
Sweetener experts from the U.S., Europe, South Africa, Japan
and Thailand will attend the symposium to discuss the use of
sweetener in food products, their role in diabetes control and
diet, side affects, neurophysiological and legal aspects.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Israeli Workers to Hold Strike Against Government's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli trade union Histadrut
is holding an urgent meeting today to approve a general strike to
gear up the labor's campaign against the government's new economic
plan.
</P>
<P>
Histadrut's parliament is expected to okay the strike,
proposed for Wednesday at the union leaders' meeting last week.
</P>
<P>
The strike will involve the public sector, government
ministries, state-owned corporations and all other organized
workers, including those from banks, Israel Electric Corporation,
Bezeq, Israel Broadcasting Authority, airports, municipalities
and civil service.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Histadrut Chairman Amir Peretz and union leaders
today are to lead a demonstration before the Knesset (Israeli
parliament) to protest the government's budget cuts, which they
have accused would only harm the lower and middle-income earners.
</P>
<P>
The Histadrut has hired 300 buses to bring some 12,000 to
15,000 labor activists to Jerusalem to stage the march. It has
also prepared thousands of posters and stickers, which will be
distributed today at many workplaces throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The labor camp has been holding protests against the new
government since it announced plans to cut the budget. On
July 1, the Histadrut called an one-hour warning strike which
involved some 400,000 workers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
However, the strike and following meetings between Peretz and
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Finance Minister Dan
Meridor failed to affect the government's decision on July 7 to
approve the 1.5 billion dollar budget cuts next year.
</P>
<P>
Peretz immediately protested that the cuts, which will affect
the education, health and social welfare allocations, were based
on giving to the rich at the expense of the poor.
</P>
<P>
He also declared the Histadrut would fight a "long
struggle" against the government's new economic program.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, Peretz sent a letter to Meridor to demand
suspension of the planned measures and opening negotiations to
"distribute the budget cuts more justly among the population."
</P>
<P>
The Histadrut is demanding that about half of the 1.5
billion dollars in budget cuts be transferred from the lower
income earners to other sectors so as to protect the weaker
section of the society.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Non-Traditional Exports Benefit Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Du Zhenfeng and Wang Nengbiao)
</P>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Zambia earned some 200 million
U.S. Dollars in 1995 from non-traditional exports, marking a 30
percent increase over that in 1994 and such exports are expected
to surpass the figure this year.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Mark O'donnel, Chairman of the Zambia
Association of Manufacturers (ZAM) at a recent marketing chat on
the subject ''promotion of international trade and performance of
Zambian products on the world market''.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Zambia has been making efforts, along with
its economic reforms, to explore and expand external markets for
its products, particularly the non-traditional exports in
addition to its copper products. As a result the total value of
its non-traditional exports has grown from 69 million U.S.Dollars
in 1987 to about 200 million U.S.Dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Export Board of Zambia (EBZ) was set up by the government
with a major aim at promoting export of non-traditional
manufactural goods. EBZ has played an active role in organizing
the manufacturers to take part in domestic and international
trade fairs so as to make publicity of Zambian goods in the
international markets and at the same time attract foreign
investors into development of the country's rich natural
resources.
</P>
<P>
EBZ organized Zambian horticulture and fresh flower companies
to take part in the 1995 Amsterdam horticultural show in the
Neitherlands. During the fair, Zambian companies established
direct links with European horticulture firms, which has resulted
in big increase of Zambia's horticultural exports. The total
income from horticultural exports reached 17.55 million
U.S.Dollars in 1995, an increase of six million U.S.Dollars over
the figure of 1994.
</P>
<P>
Zambian manufacturers and companies are encouraged to enhance
economic and trade relations with those of neighboring countries.
The Zambia Association of Chambers of Commerce and Industry
(ZACCI) and the Malawi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI)
are organizing a trade exposition scheduled on September 21 and
22 in Zambia's border town of Chipata. With the aim of
''Zambia-Malawi business spirit '96 (produce, process and
prosper)" for the exposition, ZACCI and MCCI are encouraging
participants to exhibit only locally grown or manufactured
products in the exposition.
</P>
<P>
The non-traditional products for export in Zambia at present
include cements, textiles, foodstuff, sugar, leather and leather
products and horticultural goods.
</P>
<P>
Zambian goods are of great quality and highly competitive as
compared to others from the region and the capacity for export
earnings is great given a fair trade atmosphere, O'donnel said,
adding: ''We are confident with the improvement of the quality of
goods from our manufacturers, we are happy that this trend is
increasing''.

</P>
<P>
Sumaye added some of the refugees settled in Kigoma and Kagera
regions, norther Tanzania, have been escaping from the camps and

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Israeli Religious Party to File No-Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 14 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli religious party of
ultra-Orthodox Jews announced Saturday night that it will file a
no-confidence motion against the government for a clash between
police and demonstrators on Bar-Ilan road over Shabbat.
</P>
<P>
The Unite Torah Judaism (UTJ), a member of the coalition
government, is demanding the resignation of Jerusalem police chief
Arye Amit and other senior police officers for their handling of
the demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of haredim, ultra-Orthodox Jews, demanding the
closure of Bar-Ilan road on Shabbat, clashed Saturday with police
and secular demonstrators who challenged the haredim by driving up
and down the road.
</P>
<P>
The police used water cannons to disperse the ultra-orthodox
protesters who tried to block the traffic and attacked passing
cars driven by secular Jews through the street.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that at least 13 haredi protesters were detained
by police for stone-throwing, attacking police and rioting.
</P>
<P>
UTJ's member of the Knesset (Israel's parliament) Avraham
Ravitz said that while the party does not want to bring down the
government of which it is a part, it sees no other ways to force
the police officials out.
</P>
<P>
Simple discussion with the government did not help, he said,
</P>
<P>
Ravitz said he tried to head off a confrontation by calling
Amit Friday to ask him to close the road on Shabbat, since the
Transport Ministry could not do so because of a High Court of
Justice injunction.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Amit not only refused to close the road, but
then used excessive violence against the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ornan Yekutieli, Jerusalem city councilor of Meretz,
a left-wing party, said that they respect the haredi residents'
way of life, but they are not going to allow haredim to force it
upon others.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 cars, led by Yekutieli, took part in the secular
protesters' motorcade Saturday afternoon, and he said that Meretz
would organize supporters from Tel Aviv and other areas to
protest against the closure next week.
</P>
<P>
Haredi residents said they are the majority in the area around
the road which leads to Jerusalem's northern neighborhoods, and
it is their right to be quiet on Shabbat.
</P>
<P>
They argued that there are alternative roads seculars drivers
can use if Bar-Ilan is closed.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Thai-French Trade Remains Modest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Thailand makes only 1.8 percent of
the French imports market and ranks only 11th among France's
suppliers, according to figures of the French embassy in Thailand,
available today.
</P>
<P>
The figures reflect France's geographicla bias, with its
economy opening mainly towards its neighbors, rather than Asia,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Thai shoes, clothing and knitwear are still important among
Thai exports to France. Meanwhile, the share of more value-added
products is growing, such as electrical and electronics equipment,
which between 1994 and 1995 grew by 17 percent and 37 percent
respectively, reaching exports values of 1.5 billion baht (60
million dollars) and 4.9 billion baht (196 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
French exports to Thailand are mostly investment goods,
although there has been a spectacular growth in consumer goods.
Last year, sales of French wine and cars to Thailand soared by 2.6
and 2.2 times respectively.
</P>
<P>
Even though French exports to Thailand grew 2.5 times in 1995
compared with the previous year as a result of Thailand's aircraft
orders, the embassy said the volume of the two-way trade remains
modest.
</P>
<P>
Aware of this "unusual" situation , the French government will
spare no efforts to improve this weak performance, the embassy
said.
</P>
<P>
Following French President Jacques Chirac's participation in
the Asia-Europe meeting held im March this year, the French
embassy has mapped out an action plan, aimed at an increase in the
French share on the Thai market for goods and services, a bigger
part for France on the Thai educational market, and a
strengthening of scientific and techonological cooperation.

<HEADLINE> State Metallurgical Firm Stresses Technological Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- China Metallurgical Equipment
Corp. has charted a double-track strategy emphasizing research on
the localization of advanced technology and cooperation with
related industries in designing and manufacturing metallurgical
equipment during next five years.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily said that China produced 94 million tons of
steel last year, making it the second-largest producer in the
world next to Japan. But its industrial technology and equipment
have not yet met demand.
</P>
<P>
"As a specialized, multi-functional corporation dealing in
metallurgical technology and equipment, we feel the pulse of the
country to enhance its equipment," said Li Suming, director of the
company's planning department.
</P>
<P>
Problems such as lack of variety - including a lack of
high-quality products, lack of mineral resources and out-of-date
equipment -- still hinder further development, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry urged the industry to
pay attention to its production quality and variety to enhance its
competitiveness in the world market during the 1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
China plans to raise the continuous casting ration from the
present 45 per cent to 70 per cent by the year 2000, largely on
the basis of upgrading existing continuous casting equipment and
installing additional equipment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the next five years, China will add more than 100 sets of
such equipment, he noted. In addition, high-efficiency continuous
casters will also be installed.
</P>
<P>
"The secondary metallurgical rate is another important factor
to increase quality," the director said.
</P>
<P>
China hope to raise the rate from the present 13 per cent to 35
per cent.
</P>
<P>
The industry will adopt large-scale blast furnaces and
convertors and give up all open-hearth furnaces by the turn of the
century.
</P>
<P>
It will bring the rolling technology up to the complete and
semicompete continuous rolling by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
To answer the call from the ministry, the company will focus
its efforts on the localization of advanced technology including
three compact strip production lines for the Zhujiang, Baotou and
Handan steel plants under cooperation with a German company.
Efforts will also be made on four bot rolling mill renovation
projects for the steel companies of Anshan, Wuhan, Benxi and
Shougang in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The company will also help renovate small-sized rolling mills
and achieve progress in localization of the equipment, he said.

<HEADLINE> Teamwork urged to fight dumping charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese manufacturers and trading
companies should team up to fight dumping charges raised by other
countries and avoid illegal competition in tapping the
international markets, today's China Daily said.
</P>
<P>
"Manufacturers and traders should come together to respond to
dumping charges and be self-disciplied to avoid future trouble,"
said Fan Xue'an, director of the law department of the China
Chamber of Commerce for Machinery and Electronic Products Import
and Export.
</P>
<P>
Fan's department defended and won a dumping suit raised by the
United States against Chinese bicycles, the first time the bicycle
industry has won a dumping case. The industry lost similar cases
raised by the European Union, Canada, Mexico and Argentina and
hence the market there.
</P>
<P>
Fan attributed the success of the defence against the US-raised
charge to quick response by the manufacturers and trading
companies, co-operative and thorough organization by the chamber
of commerce, China Bicycle Association and China Foreign
Investment Association, as well as the fair investigation and
judgement by the international Trade Commission of the US.
</P>
<P>
Fan said initial preparations by the industry went back to
1993. In that year, Chinese bicycle exports to the United States
surged to 3.88 million, nearly two million more than in 1992,
after China failed in the defence against dumping charges raised
by the EU, losing a major international bicycle market.
</P>
<P>
After the US began its dumping investigation in April, 1995,
the Chinese manufacturers and trade companies, under the
organization of the chamber of commerce, the bicycle association
and foreign investment association, immediately came together to
work out a united strategy to respond to the charge.
</P>
<P>
Realizing the importance of cooperation in competition for the
international market, the 22 bicycle manufacturers and trade
companies issued a written proposal to strengthen self-discipline
to maintain the US market after they won the anti-dumping charge
on June 4.
</P>
<P>
"These companies are actually setting a good example for the
other 150 bicycle producers and trade companies," said Fan, noting
that the move will also have significant influence on other
sectors threatened by dumping charges from other countries.
</P>
<P>
Qiu Boxin, deputy-secretary of the China Bicycle Association,
the national watchdog of the bicycle industry, also urged the
government to strengthen management of public bidding for export
licenses and especially to pay great importance to the US market,
which account for about one-third of the total Chinese bicycle
exports volume.

<HEADLINE> Orders for Japan's Chip-Making Equipment Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Orders for chip-making equipment
are declining in Japan as chip producers cut supplies due to a
sharp drop of chip prices, the Semiconductor Equipment Association
of Japan said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Nikon Corp. and Canon Inc., both major makers of steppers with
a combined 80 percent share of the world market, decided to
downsize their planned production.
</P>
<P>
Nikon will slash its planned annual production of 900 units to
about 700 units, the association said.
</P>
<P>
It said Canon's yearly increase rate has been reduced from 50
percent to 30 percent, and Auto Electric Co. estimated that the
sales of its memory testers would go down by some 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
It added that orders of 16-megabit dynamic random access
memories were hit hard as the U.S., followed by Japan, started to
cancel orders in spring.
</P>
<P>
However, producers of chip-making equipment remain calm in
face of oversupplies in the chip market, saying that they have
experienced similar situations.
</P>
<P>
A Nikon official said the next-generation chip after the
16-megabit devices will pull demand up again.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Affirms Chinese Funding Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank will maintain its
strong support to China during the fiscal year of 1997, which
started on July 1 of this year, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Russell Cheetham, bank vice-president in charge of the East
Asia and Pacific region, said that three billion US dollars in
loans are expected to flow to 15 to 16 projects in China in the
coming months.
</P>
<P>
The bank will continue to give priority to poverty-reduction in
inland provinces and infrastructure development, he said. Health,
education and environmental protection projects will also top the
bank's agenda, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Specific loan recipients will be announced after the bank;s
discussions with the Chinese Government.
</P>
<P>
Cheetham said China will continue to enjoy access to the bank's
soft lending arm, the International Development Association (IDA),
in fiscal year 1997 but noted that as China's economy and
per-capita income continue to grow, the day will come when China
does not quality for the IDA funds.
</P>
<P>
China resumed membership in the World Bank in 1980. By the end
of June, accumulated World Bank commitments to China exceeded 25
billion US dollars for 173 projects, about 75 per cent of which
have concentrated on infrastructure and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank is China's largest single source of foreign
capital; in terms of annual commitments, China is the bank's
largest borrower.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president paid a seven day trip to China last week and
inspected some World Bank-backed projects. Cheetham said the
quality of China's projects ranks among the best in the bank's
entire portfolio.
</P>
<P>
He expressed high regard for China's present economic situation
and said he believe China has succeeded in orchestrating a
so-called "soft-landing."
</P>
<P>
He added the World Bank welcomes China's recent measures to
speed foreign exchange reform.
</P>
<P>
The country announced earlier last month that all the country's
foreign-funded ventures will be included in the foreign exchange
buying-and-selling system. And it will make the yuan convertible
under the current account by end of this year, which Cheetham
called "a very important" step forward. "its is a further
reflection of China's growing integration with the international
economic system."

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Most Kuwaitis Keen to Have Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 14 (Xinhua)-- Up to 61 percent of Kuwaitis
are eager to have a home in foreign countries mainly because of
persistent fear of what they described as "Iraqi threat against
Kuwait," according to findings of a public opinion poll carried on
local English daily Arab Times today.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which was conducted by Al Rai Al Aam (Medium
daily) on 420 people on a random basis among the 700,000
population in the country, said that the respondents' desire to do
so was dictated by both the current geopolitical equation and the
persistence of the Iraqi threat against the tiny emirate.
</P>
<P>
The respondents through a questionnaire conceded that the
trend has its roots in the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait which
suddenly left them homeless.
</P>
<P>
Many admitted to being apprehensive of the future, and cited
this fear as being behind the desire to seek a residential home
abroad as a refuge in case of a repetition of the event.
</P>
<P>
But around 39 percent of the respondents rejected the notion,
saying their wish to have homes abroad has nothing to do with
security.
</P>
<P>
Besides, around 15 percent of the polled said they had
purchased real estate abroad for investment.
</P>
<P>
The survey said about 46 percent of those interviewed said
they prefer to have homes in European countries and the U.S. while
17 percent said they would prefer to have real estate in Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 38.5 percent of those polled said they already had
residential homes abroad for passing their summer vacations.
</P>
<P>
The poll showed that 204 of the 420 people interviewed
had suffered no residential problems during the Iraqi invasion
of the country.
</P>
<P>
Other reasons such as marriage to foreign women and
monetary flow generated by the oil also underpin their
decisions, according to the survey results.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Hurricane Bertha moved
northeastward to the north Atlantic Saturday when it approached
the New England region with heavy rain and strong winds.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, it was much stronger when the killer storm lashed the
southern part of the eastern coast of the nation on Thursday and
Friday.
</P>
<P>
There were no fresh reports of injuries as the storm became
weaker on land. But it scattered street flooding and downed trees.
</P>
<P>
By 5 p.m. EST (2100 GMT), Bertha's center was just south of
Bridgeport, Connecticut, with winds of about 45 mph (72 kph), the
National Weather Service said. The storm was accelerating toward
the northeast at 26 mph (42 kph).
</P>
<P>
"We're very, very fortunate. This storm could have been a lot
worse," Federal Emergency Management Agency director James Lee
Witt told a briefing in Washington on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Early Saturday, nine people were injured slightly as Bertha
whipped up a tornado that destroyed two mobile homes and damaged
several others in Virginia's Northumberland County on Chesapeake
Bay.
</P>
<P>
But in the New York area, there were scattered power outages
and flooding. Tens of thousands of homes on Saturday from North
Carolina to New York lost power.
</P>
<P>
The Hurricane has claimed at least eight lives during its trek
this week through the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Leeward Islands and
Puerto Rico in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
The storm has caused massive economic loss to the Atlantic
seaboard region, but actual amount is not expected to be known
within days.

30, Finance Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria said.
</P>
<P>
Exchanging views with local editors and senior journalists here
Saturday, the minister noted that debt servicing of both domestic
and foreign borrowings has been creating tremendous pressure in
the revenue budget since the government will have to pay about 20
billion taka (about 500 million dollars) annually.
</P>
<P>
The present government of the Awami League (AL) took power on
June 23 after defeating the ex-ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party
(BNP) in the June 12 parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the previous BNP government's publicized success
in achieving macro-economic stability, Kabria said that although
the inflation rate was low in the early years of BNP rule, it went
up to 5.9 percent by 1995.
</P>
<P>
Once the inflation starts rising, it becomes difficult to
contain it, he noted, adding that the new AL government will try
to bring down this rate to below 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange reserve hit the peak in the 1993-1994
fiscal year at 3.4 billion dollars but it came down to 2 billion
dollars by May 1996.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister disclosed that he planned to present the
1996-1997 budget on July 25.
</P>
<P>
The declared policy of the present government is to run the
affairs of the state on the basis of national consensus and to
establish a stable economy in the country, he said.

<HEADLINE> Nepal' All Textile Mills to Close Down This Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's textile industry has
decided to close down all textile mills by the end of this month
because of owners' fear of the new taxation measures announced by
the government last week.
</P>
<P>
In announcing the decision which is to take effect on July 30,
the Association of Textile Industries of Nepal said on Saturday
that the taxation system under the government's budget plan for
the upcoming 1996-97 fiscal year amounted to bankruptcy, the
official news agency RSS reported.
</P>
<P>
There would not be a situation where the textile industry could
function well, the association said.
</P>
<P>
According to businessmen here, the government has set an
average sales tax rate of 15 percent for the new fiscal year
starting the coming Tuesday, but fixed no concession criterion.
</P>
<P>
With the closure of these textile factories, over 10,000
Nepalese workers would lose their jobs in 210 factories.

<P>
BANGKOK, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Honda Cars (Thailand) Co. has been
told to reimburse 2,000 customers after overcharging them for a
model recently put on sale.
</P>
<P>
The Central Price Fixing and Anti-Monopoly Committee Friday
ruled that the company had overcharged customers who bought its
Honda City cars, and ordered the company to repay each buyer
16,000 baht (640 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Honda Cars had priced the Honda City at 375,000 baht (15,000
dollars) before the committee approved the price.
</P>
<P>
The committee's action against Honda Cars has set a precedent
for other car assemblers and makers in that they must refrain from
marketing products before prices have been approved by the
Commerce Ministry's price fixing committee.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Optimistic about Welfare Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Saturday predicted that the controversial issue of welfare reform
might be resolved "within the next month."
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio address, Clinton said: "This can be a real
breakthrough, a genuine turning point. We are very close."
</P>
<P>
Congressional Republicans this week separated welfare reform
from the even complicated question of reforming the Medicaid
system.
</P>
<P>
"It's no secret that this is a political year," Clinton said.
"But our nation faces challenges that cannot wait until
November.... We can achieve all these things now if we work
together."
</P>
<P>
Clinton described the decision Thursday by congressional
Republicans to abandon their plan to link welfare reform to
Medicaid as a significant step forward.
</P>
<P>
The Senate had planned to link welfare reform with cuts to the
growth rate of the Medicaid medical insurance system in one of
three anticipated fiscal 1997 budget reconciliation bills.
</P>
<P>
In his radio address, Clinton voiced support for legislation in
the Senate proposed by Democrat John Breaux of Louisiana and
Republican John Chafee Rhode Island, and in the House by
Republican Mike Castle of Delaware and Democrat John Tanner of
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
Called them "good strong bills," Clinton said, "They should be
the basis for quick agreement between the parties. And I look
forward to having a bipartisan welfare reform bill within the next
month."
</P>
<P>
Clinton's presumptive Republican challenger for the presidency,
Bob Dole, urged on Thursday that the president sign any welfare
reform package that makes its way from the Capitol to the Oval
Office within the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Clinton vetoed the first Republican welfare reform measure last
year, which included Medicare reforms and tax provisions he
disliked, and a second measure on January 9 which he said
contained work requirements that were too lenient.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Subway Gas Victims Show Chromosome Mutation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Victims of last year's Tokyo subway
gas attack tend to develop chromosome mutations more frequently, a
Japanese researcher reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Masayasu Minami from the Nippon Medical School said that a
survey of lymphocytes taken from the blood of nine people
seriously injured in the attack by nerve gas sarin found that four
had a chromosome mutation.
</P>
<P>
The chromosome mutation, termed sister chromatid exchange
(SCE), is usually found in only one in every 39 people.
</P>
<P>
A chromosome is an arrangement of genes and serves as a carrier
of hereditary characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Minami told a meeting of the Japan intoxication society that
medical checkups on the nerve gas victims should be conducted for
years to come with the government involvement.
</P>
<P>
Sarin was developed by the Germans as a chemical weapon in the
1930s. It is known to cause respiratory difficulties and
shrinkage of pupils by attacking the human nerve system.
</P>
<P>
Minami said that a chemical made in the process of sarin
manufacturing is test-proved responsible for raising the frequency
of chromosome mutations.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time a (sarin) by-product has been confirmed
harmful," Minami said, "but this does not mean necessarily that
the chromosome mutations will affect the next generation because
the number of samples is limited."
</P>
<P>
On March 20, 1995, a sarin gas attack in Tokyo subways killed
12 commuters and injured thousands.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Three separatist militants of
Corsica who were detained Thursday by police in Nice and on the
island were put in jail Friday in Ajaccio.
</P>
<P>
The arrests were made in a wave of crackdown by the French
government on crimes in the French-ruled Mediterranean island,
which has been shaken by violence in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
Thierry Gonzales, 27, a militant of the Cuncolta separatist
group, was arrested for bearing a gun of "first category" and
illegally keeping a weapon of "fourth category", said Agence
France Presse (AFP) quoting judicial sources in Ajaccio.
</P>
<P>
Gonzales, an employee of a fund transport company called
"Ajaccio Securita", was questioned by police for bearing an
automatic 9 mm pistol with a bullet ready to shoot. police also
seized a pump gun, a hood and a flying suit in his dormitory, said
an AFP report.
</P>
<P>
Another militant named Gregory Battesti, around 20 years old,
was arrested for his association with a group of lawbreakers and
for his possible involvement in bomb attacks on April 13 and 15
against properties in Porto-Vecchio, southern Corsica.
</P>
<P>
The third detainee, Jose Lucchinacci, was a militant of the
"Cuncolta Naziunalista" separatist group and was arrested in Nice.
He was accused of swindling by obtaining subsidies for paying
non-existing jobs.
</P>
<P>
French Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre this week ordered
police to tighten control of illegal arms in Corsica by
questioning all found to be bearing illegal weapons in public
places.

<HEADLINE> Plavsic Believes Bosnian Serbs Will Keep Statehood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serb acting President
Biljana Plavsic said today the Serb state is facing a difficult
diplomatic struggle to preserve the considerable degree of
statehood obtained through the Dayton peace accord.
</P>
<P>
But wisdom, courage and perseverance would help the Serb
succeed in keeping the statehood, Plavsic said, adding that any
attempt to push things back to the starting point would lead to
another war.
</P>
<P>
In an interview to Yugoslav city Novi Sad daily Dnevnik which
publishes on Sunday, Plavsic, to whom Serb leader Radovan Karadzic
had transferred all presidential powers on June 30, said that
ending the war was a great achievement of the international
community and the Dayton agreement.
</P>
<P>
Underlining that the union of Bosnia-Herzegovina would partly
undermine the statehood of both Republika Srpska and the
Muslim-Croat federation to an equal extent, Plavsic however noted
that the Serbs would also benefit from the union, especially with
regard to economy.
</P>
<P>
"The only thing Republika Srpska must not do is to let itself
be drawn into a unitary, sovereign and indivisible Bosnia-
Herzegovina as Bosnian Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic desires."
</P>
<P>
In that case, the Serbs would quickly fall into second-class
people, and the Croats would have the same fate, and in a few
decades the Serbs would disappear altogether, Plavsic said.
</P>
<P>
She emphasized that although the Serbs do not reject the union,
the long-term aspiration and final objective of the Serbs is to
live all together in one state. "The French, the Germans, the
Italians, the Spaniards all have their own states, there is no
reason why the Serbs should be denied this right," she said.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the international arrest warrants issued by the
international criminal tribunal to hunt for Serb leader Karadzic
and his military commander Ratko Mladic, Plavsic said the
Hague-based tribunal was not a court of justice but a political
court which has the sole task of accusing the Serbs, by indicting
Karadzic and Mladic and by issuing arrest warrants to them, she
said.
</P>
<P>
The international tribunal issued the arrest warrants against
Karadzic and Mladic on Thursday on charges of genocide and war
crimes. Both of them have already been indicted as war criminals
by the international criminal tribunal.
</P>
<P>
The international community, in other words the West, "is
exerting unprecedented pressure to have the Serbs presented to the
world as the aggressors and the Muslims as the victims of the
Bosnian war," Plavsic added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Kanchana Silpa-archa, daughter of
Thai Prime Minister Banharn, has denied that her land sale at a
much-higher-than-expected price was because of her father's
political influence.
</P>
<P>
Kanchana, an MP for Suphan Buri Province for her father's Chart
Thai (Thai Nation) Party, said she sold the 12 hectares of land to
the central bank in 1994 during the Chuan Leekpai administration
when her father was the opposition leader.
</P>
<P>
Kanchana bought four plots of land in 1990 for 29.5 million
baht (1.18 million U.S. dollars) and sold them in 1994 for 465.9
million baht (18.64 million dollars) to the Bank of Thailand to
build a mint, according to information submitted by a central bank
official.
</P>
<P>
Kanchana was said to have made more than 400 million baht (16
million dollars) from the deal.
</P>
<P>
She said the sale had been considered and approved by the
committee of the central bank and was done in accordance with the
regulations.
</P>
<P>
The issue was raised by the opposition in a parliamentary
debate last week and is expected to be brought up again during the

<HEADLINE> Number of Investors Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- China's strong stock market pushed
the number of Beijing's stock investors to a new high of 500,000
last week.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the figure of 30,000 at the end of 1993, the
increase is encouraging, said Gao Dadi, an official with the
Beijing Securities Registration Co, where new investors of the
city must register.
</P>
<P>
According to the Business Weekly of China Daily today,
Beijing's first securities company opened in 1992 and the current
number of investors accounts for about 2.5 percent of the
country's total, which is much smaller than that of Shanghai,
Shenzhen and Sichuan, said Gao, who estimated that the number in
Shanghai is around 8 million.
</P>
<P>
However, the growth of the number of stock investors in the
city means a market with great potential, he said.
</P>
<P>
Gao said the new round of investor enthusiasm started after
Spring Festival in mid-February when the country's two stock
exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen began to bottom out.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate cut enacted by the People's Bank of China on
May 1 and further cuts predicted by experts have served as another
major contributor to the situation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since then, an average 500 new accounts have been maintained
every day and the height was 2,000 new accounts in a day, Gao said.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of July, bluechip at Shanghai Securities
Exchange, Lujiazui Development, announced its profitable mid-year
dividend plan and Lujiazui's counterpart at Shenzhen exchange,
Shenzhen Development Bank, enjoyed support by powerful
institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
Both the two pieces of news upgraded the heat in the market,
which lured more players onto the floor.
</P>
<P>
On July 6, Gao's company broke with convention to open on
Saturday to meet the demand from the salary earners. On that day,
bicycles of people coming to open accounts caused a traffic jam
near the registration company.
</P>
<P>
Gao said that the hot market has also encouraged existing
investors to input more.
</P>
<P>
Dong Fuqi, an official at a big trade company, said that he had
doubled his investment in the market during the last two months,
though he refused to reveal the exact amount of his investment.
</P>
<P>
Dong, an economic major who began investing in 1994, said he
believed the market will keep booming in coming years because a
new economic growth cycle has just begun.
</P>
<P>
He described his new investment as "throwing a long line for a
big fish," meaning he intends to receive a secure and long-term
profit.
</P>
<P>
"I invest in companies about which I am quite knowledgeable and
I believe to have a promising future," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he believes that most investors are speculative, and
he said he would not rule out the possibility that he will also
sell some stocks to earn profits.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Paraguay net international
reserves swelled 167 million U.S. dollars in two months time as of
May, or an 18 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper "Ambiente Financiero" reported that the
Central Bank international currency reserves totalled 1.009
billion dollars in April, an 8.2 percent increase compared with
March.
</P>
<P>
The reserves were 1.1 billion dollars in May, which confirmed a
strong rally of 9 percent in the accumulation of reserves.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the reserves was attributed to more soybean
exports, foreign loans, increased interest income from the
financial market and less imports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the public foreign debt was 1.29 billion dollars,
4.2 percent less than the one registered in May of 1995, and
equivalent to 13.5 percent of the domestic gross product.

WARSAW, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Foreign car drivers will be levied
five zloties (1.85 U.S. dollars) for each entry into Poland and
the car entry taxes will be funneled to the repair and renovation
of Polish highways.
</P>
<P>
The measure, announced today by Polish Prime Minister
Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz, was aimed at raising money to help
improve the road conditions in Poland in that the country's state
budget can hardly provide the bill for the improvement project.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics showed that 30 million foreign cars
entered Poland in 1995, which if entry taxes levied, would convert
to 55.5 million dollars in tax revenue.

<P>
MANILA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine ruling Lakas party
and the MORO National Liberation Front (MNLF) have formed a
coalition by signing the manifesto for peace, unity, and
development in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports today, the manifesto was
signed by Speaker Jose De Venecia Jr., the head of Lakas, and MNLF
Chairman Nur Misuari in Sulu, Mindanao, shortly before the latter
filed his certificate of candidacy for governor of the autonomous
region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The manifesto formalized the coalition between the Lakas party
and the former rebel MNLF.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to participate fully, actively, and
peacefully in the ARMM elections in September.
</P>
<P>
The coalition will select, nominate, and campaign for a common
set of candidates for regional governor, vice governor and 21
members of the regional legislative assembly.

<HEADLINE> Farmers of Ethnic Hui Group Have Better Houses (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, July 14 (Xinhua) -- For 70 years Ma Zhanxin, of
China's ethnic Hui group, has lived in cave dwellings in
northwestern China.
</P>
<P>
But since he was young he has dreamt of living in a two-story
building with lights and a telephone. Now Ma's dream has come true.
</P>
<P>
The five members of Ma's family are enjoying a new life in a
two-story building, with a floor space of 120 square meters, and a
spacious courtyard.
</P>
<P>
Ma, and another 30 Hui farmers in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region, have lived much better lives since China began to
introduce reform and opening-up policies 17 years ago.
</P>
<P>
With more money all of the folks in Ma's village have built
new houses.
</P>
<P>
With water and electricity supplies available, and a
program-controlled telephone at home, Ma appears content with his
new lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
He often wanders to the road in front of his new house,
chatting with townsfolk in the shade of a Chinese scholartree.
</P>
<P>
"In all of our history people here have never lived in such
spacious and cosy homes," he said.
</P>
<P>
For centuries farmers in Ningxia lived in adobe houses, with
paper covering the window frames. Many lived in dark cave
dwellings on earth plateaus or in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
But at present, more than 120,000 farmers in Ningxia have moved
out of their cave dwellings into new houses. The average living
space of local people there has risen from 13 square meters in
1990 to present 17 square meters, well above the country's average
level.
</P>
<P>
Along with the construction of new houses, rural infrastructure
facilities have helped make constant improvements. Rural areas in
Ningxia take the lead in having access to electricity among all
five autonomous regions in China.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 90 percent of villages are connected with
highways. Many villages have built schools, recreation and
cultural activity centers and clinics. Modern living methods have
become accepted as the 'norm' by more and more farmers.

<HEADLINE> Farmers of Ethnic Hui Group Have Better Houses  (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sociologists said that the new houses have reflected Hui
farmers' sense of modern civilization. Xigang villagers, with
average annual incomes topping 2,000 yuan (about 241 US dollars),
have their rooms decorated with white and green ceramic tiles, and
they have installed toilets. Heating systems have replaced the
traditional "Kang," a heatable brick bed.
</P>
<P>
The shabby houses have been given over to domestic animals. In
some households, domestic animals even live in the two-story
buildings.
</P>
<P>
Many Hui farmers have planted flowers on balconies and in their
courtyards. Some families have provided their children with small
reading rooms.
</P>
<P>
In Yinhua Farmers' New Village in suburban Yinchuan, capital of
the region, a 1,000 square meter public greenland, and a corridor
for taking rests, connect the residences.
</P>
<P>
People in Caiqiao Village, which is situated by the Yellow
River, have built a riverside park covering 20 hectares, as well
as a theater.
</P>
<P>
Along with the construction of new houses, ecological
conditions in rural villages have improved. In Yinchuan prefecture
and Yinnan area irrigated by the Yellow River water, local farmers
have gone in for "courtyard economies." They have made money from
planting fruit trees and vegetables around their houses. By doing
so a small ecological environment around the houses has
developed.

<HEADLINE> Measures Needed to Deal with Powder Coal Ash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Experts have called on the
relevant Chinese departments to speed up researches until ways
that powder coal ash can be utilized.
</P>
<P>
They say that by the year 2000 China will have a 160 million
ton mountain of the powder ash - a waste product from coal fire
power stations.
</P>
<P>
Powder coal ash is the solid waste of the power stations and
large-scale coal-burning plants.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China produces some 80 million tons of
coal ash every year, causing severe environmental pollution.
</P>
<P>
According to the Beijing-based "China's Township Enterprises
News", China has made great achievements in the utilization of
coal ash.
</P>
<P>
It said that some 75 percent of coal ash has been recycled,
with over a third used as raw material to produce construction
materials, while a quarter goes in road building.
</P>
<P>
Experts have agreed that the increase in coal ash has made it a
necessity to look for other outlets for the waste.

<HEADLINE> China to See Balanced Soda Ash Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- China will witness a balanced soda
ash supply and demand this year, according to "China Township
Enterprises News".
</P>
<P>
According to the Beijing-based newspaper, China plans to
produce 5.8 million tons of soda ash, and import 50,000 tons this
year.
</P>
<P>
It predicted that the demand for soda ash will be some six to
6.2 million tons, the same as last year.
</P>
<P>
It contributed the sluggish demand of soda mainly to the fact
that some soda-consuming industries, such as plate glass
production, will decrease their production this year because of
increasing stocks and sluggish markets.
</P>
<P>
The export of soda ash is also unlikely to increase by a large
margin, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The price of soda ash will not increase in the near future, the
newspaper said after analysis, warning producers to attach more
importance to limiting their production.

<HEADLINE> MNLF Chair Can Still Head South Council: Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' Presidential
Palace said it saw "no legal problem" for Muslim rebel chief Nur
Misuari to head the proposed Southern Philippines Council for
Peace and Development even if he wins as governor of the
autonomous region for Muslim Mindanao in the September elections.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ruben Torres said at a news briefing on
Saturday that some are raising the possible constitutional
questions about this, but he "did not really find anything that
prohibits a local official from occupying another position in
government."
</P>
<P>
What the law prohibits is double compensation as governor and
council chairman, not double positions, Torres said, adding
Misuari has to waive one salary if he "wears the two hats."
</P>
<P>
Torres said arrangements are being made for a meeting between
President Fidel Ramos and Misuari, chairman of the MORO National
Liberation Front (MNLF). Ramos has expressed willingness to
personally campaign for Misuari.
</P>
<P>
Misuari has said he was finally persuaded to run as governor
after the government gave strong assurances that he would be
appointed chairman of the council.
</P>
<P>
According to the commission on elections, a total of 105 bets
filed their certificates of candidacy for the 23 positions in the
September polls, and three of them are running against Misuari.

demanding immediate payment of long-delayed wages, the total of
which was not available.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Raspinov, chairman of the Donbass striking committee,
said that coal miners demand that the state pay them all their
wages in arrears before Monday.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if the government fails to meet their demand,
the striking coal miners will resort to more vehement activities.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian Prime Minister Pavel Lazarenko is scheduled to go to
explain the state budgetary difficulties to the coal miners in
Donetsk, the country's center of coal mining industry.
</P>
<P>
Last October, thousands of coal miners from 183 out of the 240
coal enterprises in Donbass went on strike demanding payment of
overdue wages.
</P>
<P>
The central bank promised in November to allot by phases 52
trillion rubles (30 million dollars) to pay miners' wage arrears
accumulated over the several months.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Denounces U.S. Flight as "Dangerous" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Cuba today accused a
U.S. government plane of infringing upon the security of three
civil aircraft belonging respectively to three different
countries, local press reported.
</P>
<P>
The serious incident occurred Thursday when the U.S. plane
entered without previous notice and coordination with the Havana
flight information region, Cuba's official news agency Prensa
Latina quoted Parliament President Ricardo Alarcon as saying in a
letter to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).
</P>
<P>
After the Cuban radar system detected the flight of an
unidentified aircraft operating in the Havana flight information
region, the air traffic information center established
communication with its Miami counterpart asking for identification
of the aircraft, said Alarcon.
</P>
<P>
The Miami flight control center said it was "a U.S. government
aircraft operating under orders of the zone with transponder code
5400."
</P>
<P>
As the irregular flight continued and made no contact with the
Cuban flight control center, the center later sent a second
message to Miami warning that the aircraft was dangerously
approaching three commercial airliners flying within their normal
schedules in international routes, he said.
</P>
<P>
This was the second incident of its kind registered in recent
days, affecting in this occasion the normal flight of planes
belonging to commercial airlines of Guatemala, Costa Rica, and the
United States itself, Alarcon added.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Project in Great Progress in First Half Year  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The gigantic Three Gorges Project
is on target after making great progress in the first half of this
year, China Yangtze Three Gorges Project Development Corporation
has reported.
</P>
<P>
The corporation says that most of the scheme's many projects
are proceeding as planned.
</P>
<P>
Now staff are working non-stop to ensure that a potential
flood season does not slow things down.
</P>
<P>
The company, undertaker of the project, detailed the mammoth
tasks that have taken place so far this year on one of the world's
biggest construction sites.
</P>
<P>
-- More than 7.24 million cubic meters of earth and rocks have
been excavated, accounting for 38 percent of the year's earthworks.
</P>
<P>
-- 794,000 cubic meters of concrete have been placed,
accounting for 47 percent of the target set for 1996.
</P>
<P>
-- 101,600 square meters of concrete have been sprayed,
accounting for 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
-- 24,600 square meters of walled area has been completed to
prevent water seepage, comprising 39 percent of the year's work.
</P>
<P>
Following success in the first quarter, the second-quarter
construction cast its eyes on preparing for the damming of Yangtze
in November of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Projects for the dry-water season was also completed on
schedule. Concrete was poured in major parts of the project before
the high-water season.
</P>
<P>
Preparations were also made for the second-phase of the
project, from 1997 to the year 2003. This work is pushing forward
as planned.
</P>
<P>
Officials say high temperatures and heavy rains in the second
quarter this year brought difficulty to concrete laying work. But
with valiant efforts of the design, overseeing departments and
work teams, the concrete work on sections on a crucial cofferdam
on the right bank was completed in time, and to a high quality.

<P>
The Xiling Yangtze River Bridge has spanned the river, and is
expected to open to traffic in the near future. The Datuo road on
the right bank has also been finished.
</P>
<P>
The speed of construction on a major highway, exclusively built
to link the dam site with the outside world, apparently became
fast in the first half year. The highway is targeted to open to
traffic on October 1, but its construction will still be an
arduous task, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Tests for the damming of Yangtze are being carried out day and
night.
</P>
<P>
But the company also said that the excavation work for the
temporary shiplock and shiplift was relatively slow, while the
excavation work in one area of the downstream navigation channel
has lagged behind.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the company said they are sparing no efforts in
fighting a forthcoming flood to ensure the safety of major
works. And they say they are confident that the project will stay
on target.
</P>
<P>
Three Gorges Project, the world's largest water-control, is
expected to be completed in the year 2009. It is built to harness
floods, generate power, and improve navigation.

<HEADLINE> Breakthrough in Sino-Canadian Cooperation on Qinshan Nuclear Power Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- China and Canada have signed a
project award agreement for the cooperation for the Qinshan phase
III Candu nuclear power project, marking a significant progress in
commercial negotiations between both countries on the construction
of two 700 MW class Candu units.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed between the China National Nuclear
Corporation (CNNC) and the Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL)
in Beijing on July 12, finalized the price and commercial terms
for Qinshan Phase III Candu nuclear power project, as well as the
financing scope and conditions from the Canadian Export
Development Corporation, and the other export credit agencies,
which are the key elements of the final contract.
</P>
<P>
President of the China National Nuclear Corporation Jiang
Xinxiong, and President of the Atomic Energy of Canada Limited
Reid Morden, who attended the signing ceremony, expressed their
hope that the signing will be the starting point of a long-term
partnership on nuclear energy between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Since the agreement of cooperation on the peaceful utilization
of nuclear energy was signed between the Chinese and Canadian
governments during the Canadian Prime Minister's visit to China in
November of 1994, there has been significant progress in
cooperation between the two countries on construction of nuclear
power projects.
</P>
<P>
Of particular note, during the visit to Canada by Premier Li
Peng in October of 1995, the governments of China and Canada
signed a memorandum of understanding, which outlined agreement on
cooperation for the construction of two Candu units at the Qishan
site. In addition, CNNC concluded an agreement on the principles
for commercial negotiations with AECL. With the attention and
support offered by the leaders of both countries, detailed
technical and commercial negotiations began and after nearly six
months' effort, the project award agreement was signed, which
serves as basis for the approval process, and the formal signing
of contracts.
</P>
<P>
The project consortium will be led by AECL and the customer is
Qinshan Nuclear Power Company. The reactor type is the proven 700
MW Candu design, one of the world's highest-performing reactor
types. It has been installed and operated in Canada, Argentina,
the Republic of Korea and Romania. There are currently three more
Candu's of this type under construction in the Republic of Korea,
in addition to the Qinshan Project. Discussions are underway for a
second unit in Romania.
