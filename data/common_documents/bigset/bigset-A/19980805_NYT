GRUDZIELANEK HURT BY BOOING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Mark Grudzielanek couldn't believe what he was
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Every time he came to bat, every time he touched the ball at
shortstop Tuesday night, the Olympic Stadium crowd booed.
</P>
<P>
   Until he was traded from the Expos to the Dodgers on Friday,
Grudzielanek had been a favorite son. Now he was a target, and he
didn't like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very disappointed,'' said Grudzielanek after the Expos
came from behind to beat the Dodgers in 10 innings. ``I played hard
in front of them for four years, busted my butt every day. And that
is what I get? I'm shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek went 0 for 3 with two strikeouts and was struck on
the left hand by a pitch from Expos starter Mike Thurman. But most
of all, it was the fan reaction that hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek was criticized in the Canadian media for going
public with his disdain for Expos management, which had discussed a
multi-year contract before signing him last winter to a one-year
$350,000 contract.
</P>
<P>
   With Tuesday's crowd just 10,515, it was easy to hear individual
fans yelling at Grudzielanek about money.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not know the whole situation,'' he said. ``But I had
no control over what happened the past few days. I liked playing
here, but it was time to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Suspension upheld: Gary Sheffield began his three-game
suspension Thursday for his part in the June 28 brawl with
Pittsburgh catcher Jason Kendall. He flew back to Los Angeles on
Tuesday morning and will rejoin the team Friday for the opener of a
nine-game homestand.
</P>
<P>
   The club was optimistic the suspension would be reduced when
National League president Leonard Coleman did not decide
Sheffield's fate last Friday, when the two met. Umpires reports
said Kendall instigated the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield also was fined $1,000, which will be paid by the club.
Money for all fines goes to the Baseball Assistance Team, an
organization that lends a hand to former major leaguers in
financial trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield stayed behind in New York when the team went to
Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things don't get reversed very often,'' manager Glenn
Hoffman said. ``We left him in New York because we figured the
suspension would go through. It would have been pretty weird if he
had been cleared to play. We would have had to get him up here in a
hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla closer: Bobby Bonilla, on the disabled list since July
15 (left wrist), hit a dozen home runs from the left side in
batting practice and hopes to be activated Thursday. But he remains
realistic about his condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was a controlled environment,'' Bonilla said. ``There is
a big difference between a 65-mph fastball and a 95-mph fastball.
Only then can you judge your bat speed. But things seem to be
coming together.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman said he would like to see Bonilla wait until Friday,
when the Dodgers open a nine-game homestand. Bonilla, who played
third base until the club promoted Adrian Beltre in early July,
probably will go back to left field, which has been platooned by
Matt Luke, Trenidad Hubbard and Roger Cedeno.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time: Tuesday marked Hoffman's return to Olympic
Stadium for the first time since he was traded to the Dodgers from
Boston in August 1987. Hoffman, then a shortstop, arrived only to
learn he had not cleared waivers and was forced to wait three days
before he could be activated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't supposed to be with the team until I cleared
waivers,'' Hoffman said. ``But I just holed up in the clubhouse
until the whole thing blew over.''

THE NEW BOSS? HOW ABOUT BORA?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bora Milutinovic, unceremoniously dumped as the U.S. national
team coach less than a year after guiding the Americans to the
second round of the 1994 World Cup, might be returning to his
second -- third? fourth? -- home.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian maestro, who has also taken teams from Mexico, Costa
Rica and, this summer, Nigeria to the World Cup, appears to be the
frontrunner to again take charge of the U.S. team, a job that U.S.
Soccer plans to fill before a new president succeeds Alan
Rothenberg in 2{ weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Milutinovic, U.S. coach from 1991 through 1995, is one of four
candidates to succeed Steve Sampson, who resigned after the Yanks'
failure in France. Rothenberg clearly favors him over the others:
former Brazil boss Carlos Alberto Parreira, United Arab Emirates
coach (and former U.S. technical director) Carlos Queiroz, and D.C.
United (and 1996 U.S. Olympic) coach Bruce Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public expects results, and Bora is a master strategist
and technician,'' Rothenberg said during Major League Soccer's
All-Star Game festivities in Orlando. ``We need a coach to do the
best with what we have. We need to get maximum results in
qualifying for the World Cup in 2002, and Bora has a proven record
of accomplishing a lot with less talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Arena, who interviewed last week with U.S. Soccer, said he
thinks the decision has already been made.
</P>
<P>
   If it has, it would appear to be a disavowel of Sampson's tenure
and an admittance that firing Milutinovic 3{ years ago was a
mistake. It also would end plans for ``vertical integration,''
wherein the national team coach would set tactical policy for
American soccer as a whole and head efforts to produce talented
players. The only candidates with that ability are Queiroz, who is
unlikely to leave his UAE post, and Arena, an outsider from the
start.
</P>
<P>
   MLS's best: Just a guess
</P>
<P>
   A quirk of scheduling, mandated by the World Cup, has left Major
League Soccer heading into its stretch run as the All-Star break
arrived, and what better time to check on its progress.
</P>
<P>
   The good news has to do with expansion Chicago Fire's strong
showing on the field (13-9, second in the West) and at the gate
(18,659 per game). The bad news is the continued apathy of soccer
fans in Kansas City (7,657 average) and Tampa (9,413).
</P>
<P>
   MLS's survival doesn't seem in question, but whether
Commissioner Doug Logan, whose contract expires at season's end,
will be retained could hinge on attendance. The league average
(14,681) lags far behind 1996 figures (17,416) but is slightly
better than in 1987 (14,616).
</P>
<P>
   On the field, the level of play has improved but still doesn't
come close to measuring up to the world's top leagues -- no
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Early MVP is Chicago midfielder Peter Nowak, the Fire's chief
inspiration, who is sidelined with a knee injury that could keep
him out until September. That's bad news: Chicago is 0-5 without
him.
</P>
<P>
   D.C. United's Ben Olsen edges out the Galaxy's Clint Mathis for
rookie of the year, and Chicago's Bob Bradley is the choice for
coach of the year, although L.A.'s Octavio Zambrano deserves
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Likeliest finalists: D.C. and the Galaxy. D.C. shut out L.A. in
both meetings this season.

</P>
<P>
   --Ousted U.S. coach Steve Sampson has lined up his next
assignment: He's the new technical director for Las Virgenes Soccer
Club of Agoura Hills, one of Southern California's top youth clubs.
Sampson, who lives in Agoura Hills, will oversee the club's
training regimen and work with its U-16 team three times a week.

also is part of the group, and expected to be involved is Peter
Ueberroth, the former baseball commissioner and president of the
1984 Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee.

   --Carlos Valderrama, the 1996 MLS MVP, nearly joined former
coach Thomas Rongen with the New England Revolution in a
blockbuster trade over the weekend, but the deal fell through on
Monday and the Colombian midfielder will remain with the Miami
Fusion. Valderrama, fined $10,000 last week after refusing to train
for new coach Ivo Wortman, apparently vetoed the four-player deal
that would have sent Joe-Max Moore to Miami, which is Moore's
wife's hometown. The former Tampa Bay playmaker, who has been held
out of two games since Wortman replaced Carlos ``Cacho'' Cordoba,
rejoined Fusion camp on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>

Marcelo Herrera, who has been loaned to Belgrano of Argentina's
first division.

<P>
   --San Jose forward Eric Wynalda, who during the World Cup said
he planned on leaving MLS, now says he's happy with the Clash ...

close of the season. That could happen if San Jose fails to reach
the playoffs.

<P>
   --Fluminense, once one of Brazil's finest teams now reduced to
little more than a joke, is pleading with former FIFA president
Joao Havelange to take charge of the club, which has been relegated

be a Fluminense sympathizer and is considered the only man who can
bridge the club's warring board of directors.

GUERREROS PLEASED TO PLAY TOGETHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
  MONTREAL _ There was a storybook ending cooking in the ninth
inning of Wilton Guerrero's first game against the Dodgers. But
Guerrero grounded out with the bases loaded on the first pitch to
end a rally. Patience was never one of his virtues and as a result
the Dodgers never had much in him.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But he doesn't answer to them anymore.
</P>
<P>
   After Tuesday night's 5-4 Expos victory in 10 innings, Guerrero
appeared relieved that his Dodgers experience, which began in April
1997 when he was their Opening Day second baseman, is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my chance now,'' said Guerrero, who was traded Friday
with three minor-leaguers for pitcher Carlos Perez and infielder
Mark Grudzielanek. ``Nobody will be looking over my shoulder and
wondering what I could have done better. Nobody will be saying if I
have a bad week whether I should be in the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dodgers have to win right now, all the time. They can't
wait. Now I feel I can settle in here. It feels very good.''
</P>
<P>
   It felt especially good Saturday night, in his first game after
joining the Expos. In his first at-bat, Guerrero, 23, reached base
on an infield single, stole second and scored on a base hit by his
brother Vladimir. Suddenly, leaving the Dodgers' wild-card race for
a team 30 games out of first didn't seem so bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've waited my whole life to play with him in the big
leagues,'' said Vladimir, who was named Monday at National League
Player of the Month for July. ``He will be comfortable here. It
will be great.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Paul Konerko, another Dodgers prospect who was angry when
traded to Cincinnati at the All-Star break, Guerrero does not have
hard feelings toward his former club. When he was pulled from
Friday's game and told he was traded eight minutes before the first
pitch, Guerrero packed and left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe they got rid of him and I understand why he
was mad,'' said Guerrero, who played with Konerko this year. ``That
guy is going to be a great player. With me, I kind of expected it.
It was weird so close to game time, but everyone kind of figured
something was going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Expos say the minor-leaguers Peter Bergeron, Ted
Lilly and Jon Tucker were a bigger part of the deal than Guerrero,
he could play a critical role in shaping the future of the
franchise. The club wants to sign Vladimir Guerrero to a multiyear
contract and he is ecstatic that his brother has joined the club.
Vladimir batted .385 with 11 homers and 24 RBI in July.
</P>
<P>
   But Montreal is not likely to give Vladimir a new deal until
they learn the fate of a new downtown stadium that should be known
by September. The club is trying to raise $100 million in the
Montreal business community, then ask the province of Quebec to
fund the remaining $150 million. In 14 months, however, the Expos
have received commitments of only $32 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is he came to play everyday for me,'' said Glenn
Hoffman, Guerrero's manager at Triple-A and the big leagues. ``He's
still growing, but he can be a good one.''

TEXAS TECH BASEBALL EXPECTS BIG HIT FROM SANCTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUBBOCK, Texas _ Of all the Texas Tech sports affected by
yesterday's NCAA scholarship reductions, the most telling hit might
have been administered to the baseball team, which lost three
additional grants in 2001-2002.
</P>
<P>
   That means the Tech baseball team, which won the 1997 Big 12
regular-season title and the 1998 Big 12 postseason tournament,
will lose a total of nine scholarships during the next three years.
Because no player on the team gets a full scholarship, baseball
coach Larry Hays estimated that each grant equates to ``three
pretty good players.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing three per year, in essence, means a reduction of nine
contributors each season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball will certainly have a significant reduction,'' said
Tech Chancellor John T. Montford, noting the NCAA-mandated cutback
from 11.7 scholarships per year to 8.7 for the next three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we're determined to handle as well as we can,''
Hays said. ``I'm not ever looking backward on this thing again. I
want to let go. It's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the difficulties might only be beginning. Because
Tech's scholarship cuts in football, men's basketball and baseball
extend for three years, the Red Raiders figure to be playing
shorthanded in several sports at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inescapably, the third year out is the one that will have the
most cumulative effect from a competition standpoint,'' Montford
said. ``I think the third year will be our bellwether year on
whether we can maintain a level of competition.''

LOS ANGELES CITY COUNCIL JOINS FIGHT AGAINST VOTER-APPROVED PROP.
227
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' state news file.) 
(Repeating for those needing) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite widespread voter approval, the Los Angeles City Council
voted Tuesday to join legal efforts to overturn Proposition 227,
the measure that all but banned bilingual education in California.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-3 vote came after a lengthy debate over whether council
members should disregard the will of the voters. Proposition 227
passed June 2 with better than 60 percent of the vote statewide and
51.8 percent support in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Four council members _ Laura Chick, John Ferraro, Mike Feuer and
Ruth Galanter _ voted to fight Proposition 227 although the
majority of voters in their own districts supported the measure's
requirement that California students be taught in English.
</P>
<P>
   Chick's west San Fernando Valley district passed the bilingual
ban by a 2-1 margin of 10,454 votes, while Feuer's Sherman
Oaks-Westside district went 4-3 for the ban, a 5,084 margin. It was
closer in Ferraro's North Hollywood-Los Feliz district and in
Galanter's Venice-Westchester district.
</P>
<P>
   ``I become concerned when a measure such as this, or Proposition
187 and 209, appear directed at a single group,'' Chick said.
``That's not something we can afford at this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognize that my district voted strongly in favor of this
and I try to serve my district. But this is something that I
believe strongly in and we cannot afford further division in this
city.''
</P>
<P>
   Feuer said his personal views compelled him to disregard his
constituents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some issues go beyond us deciding to not challenge what the
voters have approved. The issues at stake are compelling. It seems
to me we should join this lawsuit because it involves access to a
quality education,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The only votes against the city joining the suit came from
council members Joel Wachs, Hal Bernson and Cindy Miscikowski, all
of whom represent San Fernando Valley districts.
</P>
<P>
   City officials downplayed the cost and significance of the City
Council's action since several civil rights and Latino groups
already have filed suit and the Los Angeles Unified School District
decided to implement Proposition 227 after a federal court ruled it
was constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Richard Alatorre introduced the motion for the city,
which has no jurisdiction over the schools, to join the lawsuit as
a friend of the court, saying council members may be better
informed on the issue than voters were.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying people were ignorant when they voted for
Proposition 227. I just don't think they had all the information on
how important this program is,'' Alatorre said.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg said the issue goes beyond what the
majority of voters believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things that rise to a level of human rights in
a society like ours. And the right to a free, appropriate education
is right up there with basic human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a law that says students are not going to be given an
equal opportunity to get an education. We all want our children to
speak English, but we want them to learn as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Wachs and Miscikowski argued the city had no reason to get
involved in the legal action since there already is a lawsuit
pending.
</P>
<P>
   Bernson, who said he favored Proposition 227, criticized his
colleagues for casting English immersion supporters in a bad light.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who supported 227 did not have ulterior motives,''
he said. ``We felt we were doing what was best for the kids. People
who supported this felt many children are being cheated by not
being taught in the language of the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not directed just at those who speak Spanish. There
are other languages in this city. The future for all of them is to
speak English.''
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 227, which ends most bilingual education programs in
the state, took effect in the LAUSD on Monday at 50 year-round
schools. About 10,000 students with limited English proficiency
began semesters in sheltered English immersion programs. District
officials say the effort is going smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   To comply with the council's will, city attorneys will review
the legal arguments filed in the case, said Chief Assistant City
Attorney Pete Echeverria.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have to, we'll prepare our own brief, but more likely we
will look at the other briefs already filed and say the city agrees
with that argument,'' Echeverria said.
</P>
<P>
   Sherri Annis of English for the Children questioned the
council's action since the LAUSD recently went to court, saying it
was ready to implement the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem to disagree with the LAUSD and its lawyers,'' Annis
said. ``Also, this is just another attempt to halt the
implementation of a law that was long overdue and very popular in
California and Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy City Attorney Frank Orozco said the main arguments filed
against the measure involve potential violations of the Civil
Rights Act and the Equal Education Opportunity Act.
</P>
<P>
   Several suits are challenging the law, the main one filed by the
Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, the American
Civil Liberties Union, the California Latino Civil Rights
Association, the National Council of La Raza, and the Southern
Christian Leadership Council.

BOWL ELIGIBILITY DECISION A RELIEF FOR TEXAS TECH PLAYERS

<P>
   LUBBOCK, Texas _ Texas Tech tailback Ricky Williams has yet to
go through his first session of two-a-day football practices, much
less don shoulder pads for the Red Raiders' season opener against
UT-El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   But the sophomore from Duncanville said he feels as if Tech
already is sporting a 1-0 record in 1998 in the wake of yesterday's
NCAA announcement that the football team would not be barred from
bowl competition for a second consecutive season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good term for it _ a victory,'' said Williams, who
celebrated the news by exchanging shouts and hugs with
administrative assistant Jennie Bailey in the Tech football office.
``I feel like 1,000 pounds have been lifted off my back. Now we
have a chance to do something. We have something to work for. It'll
be more interesting, with the chance to go to a bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he was ``a little concerned'' about a possible
drop-off in motivation and team morale if Tech had been forced to
skip the postseason for a second consecutive year because of rules
violations committed within the athletic department between
1991-97.
</P>
<P>
   During that stretch, at least 76 athletes in nine different
sports _ including 46 football players _ were allowed to compete
despite being academically ineligible because of errors committed
by members of Tech's academic certification department. After the
violations were uncovered in October during a university audit,
Tech officials voluntarily removed the 1997 football team from
consideration for the Big 12 championship or a bowl bid.
</P>
<P>
   Tech finished 6-5, ending a school-record streak of four
consecutive bowl appearances.
</P>
<P>
   NCAA officials added to Tech's self-imposed sanctions yesterday
but did not impose any additional postseason bans on athletic
teams. That frees the football team to play for a Big 12 title and
a bowl bid in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tickled to death,'' coach Spike Dykes said. ``The huge
positive is the fact there's no more cloud. There's no more maybes,
no more uncertainties. The cloud is gone now and we can go on about
our business. That makes a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Middle linebacker Kyle Shipley, a team captain and Martin High
School graduate, shared the enthusiasm but not Williams' choice of
words.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a victory, but it sure feels good,'' Shipley said.
``I'd be ignorant if I said it didn't make any difference in the
way we felt. I don't know if we'll play any harder, but team morale
will certainly be higher knowing that if we can play ourselves into
a bowl, we'll get to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of an inviting nonconference schedule, Tech's bowl
chances appear good. None of Tech's first five opponents (UTEP,
North Texas, Fresno State, Iowa State and Baylor) posted a winning
record in 1997. Their combined record was 17-39. Continuation of
that trend could result in Tech taking a 5-0 mark into an Oct. 10
game against Oklahoma State in Lubbock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't look too far ahead, but we've definitely got
something to play for now,'' quarterback Rob Peters said. ``We've
got the chance to go out and prove ourselves. But no one is going
to give us free wins.''

MOST ANALYSTS FEELING BEARISH AFTER MARKET DROP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After Tuesday's rout in the stock markets, Wall
Street has started to use a ``b'' word it hasn't uttered in more
than a decade: Bear.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market certainly has been quite volatile lately, but
market analysts believe that Tuesday's rout was particularly a
concern because two key indicators both fell near or below
year-to-date lows at the same time: The Dow Jones industrial
average and the Dow Jones transportation average.
</P>
<P>
   ``That puts in place the Dow theory _ when industrials and
transportation make new lows or highs, it signals a (shift to) a
bear or bull market,'' said Greg Smith, chief investment strategist
at Prudential Securities in New York. ``The mood of investors is
going to get a lot more cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 299.43
points, the third-largest point drop in its history, to 8487.31.
However, the 3.4 percentage dip isn't even among the 20 worst
percentage losses in stock market history.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the sell-off was widespread. Only one of the 30 stocks
that comprise the Dow Jones index rose: Procter &AMP; Gamble, which
jumped $1.50 to $77.75.
</P>
<P>
   Adding Tuesday's sell-off, the Dow is now off 9.1 percent since
its all-time high of 9337.97, set 12 trading days ago on July 17.
</P>
<P>
   Other indexes have also sustained substantial drops recently:
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 is down 9.6 percent from its July 17
all-time high and the Nasdaq Composite is off 11.35 percent from
its July 20 all-time high.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq has had what Wall Street calls a ``correction,''
which is defined as a drop of 10 percent or more. A ``bear
market,'' in Wall Street terms, occurs after a 20 percent decline.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, Prudential's Smith told his clients to pare
back their exposure to stocks. He urged them to put half of assets
in stocks and half in bonds. Previously, his advice was 65 percent
stocks, 25 percent bonds and 10 percent real estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling was that the economic news was going to get weaker
and analysts were still too optimistic on profits,'' Smith said.
``What we're now seeing is the market reflecting ... more things to
worry about on the profit front.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Allmon, editor and publisher of Growth Stock Outlook
newsletter in Bethesda, Md., believes the market has indeed changed
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bear market has just begun,'' he said. ``I'm telling my
subscribers that they should be looking at a dirty, four-letter
word called C-A-S-H.''
</P>
<P>
   He cites overvalued stocks, deteriorating corporate earnings and
the Japanese recession and the Asian financial crisis continuing to
affect U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   Allmon predicts that the Dow and the S&AMP;P will go down by 40
percent to 50 percent by 2000, give or take a year.
</P>
<P>
   As such, he has been telling readers to park 85 percent of
assets in cash. The rest should be invested in gold.
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Mills, a senior vice president at Sutro &AMP; Co. in
Woodland Hills, believes it's premature for some analysts to
declare the bull market dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are wrong,'' he said. ``The market is letting out a
little steam.''
</P>
<P>
   The underpinnings of the market are still strong, Mills said,
citing low interest rates and low inflation. While corporate
earnings took a little hit, he said they are still quite healthy.
The bull market still has a way to go.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, investors who are nervous about the turbulent
market should buy and hold quality companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you pick good quality companies and stick with them, they
will bear out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, at least, Mills was one of the few people
talking about deals on Wall Street. In fact, one widely followed
analyst announced he no longer thinks the Dow will hit 10,000 by
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``After being bullish for three and a half years, I'm in the
bear camp,'' Ralph Acampora, Prudential Securities Inc.'s market
strategist, told Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   He said he now believes the Dow average may decline as much as
20 percent from its highs, which would take it down to 7,470.

FRANCO BLOWS A SAVE, BUT METS SURVIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Franco took the field in the ninth inning
Tuesday night to loud applause and anthems blaring in his honor.
With a chance to celebrate his freshly signed contract extension,
the New York Mets' 37-year-old closer went to the mound at Shea
Stadium to try to put the finishing touch on a stirring
come-from-behind victory over the San Francisco Giants. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was only a matter of minutes before the boos were raining
down on him, shouts of, ``Franco, you're a bum,'' reverberating
through the emptying stands. Earlier in the day, when smiling for
the cameras at a news conference to herald his two-year, $6 million
extension, Franco had talked of his ability to withstand the boos.
Now he had an opportunity to show it.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The boos streamed down steadily, and deservedly, as Franco
squandered a two-run lead in the ninth and allowed the Giants to
tie the score, 6-6. It was his sixth blown save of the year. With
the contract extension reaffirming his status as the closer, Franco
limped out of the game, leaving it in the hands of someone else. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Franco remained stuck at 380 career saves. This time the save
went to a hitter, Lenny Harris, who did not lift the bat from his
shoulder. Harris worked out a walk with the bases loaded in the
10th inning, pushing across the winning run to salvage a 7-6
victory over San Francisco. The hard-earned victory pulled the Mets
to within one-half game of the Giants in the wild-card race, and
kept them three games behind the Cubs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harris' mild heroics came after Tony Phillips led off the bottom
of the 10th inning with a single to center and moved to second base
on a wild pitch. Edgardo Alfonzo walked, and John Olerud hit a hard
single to right, loading the bases with nobody out. But Mike Piazza
chopped a grounder to short, and with the infield drawn in, Rich
Aurilia threw out Phillips at the plate. Brian McRae then bounded
softly to first, and J.T. snow fired home to get Alfonzo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Jose Mesa went to a 3-0 count on Harris, who had entered the
game as a pinch-runner for Todd Hundley in the seventh inning.
Kerwin Danley, the home plate umpire, called strike one on a close
pitch. Harris then took strike two. But Mesa delivered low on 3-2,
and Harris celebrated as he trotted to first and Olerud came home. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Mets fell behind early because of uncharacteristic wildness
by Al Leiter. After walking one batter in each of the first two
innings, he issued a base on balls to pitcher Mark Gardner in the
third and followed that by hitting Shawon Dunston with the next
pitch. Ellis Burks bounced a run-scoring single up the middle, and
Barry Bonds then slipped a ground ball between first and second to
put the Giants ahead by 2-0. The Giants added two more runs in the
sixth inning, when Joe Carter and Brent Mayne hit back-to-back
doubles and Rich Aurilia followed with a run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets finally broke through in the bottom of the sixth
inning, loading the bases on a McRae single, a hit batter and a
Lopez single. Pinch-hitter Todd Pratt delivered a hard single up
the middle, driving in a pair of runs to cut the deficit in half.
Tony Phillips then delivered a double into the left-field corner,
scoring Lopez and sending Pratt to third. Pratt scored on a
grounder by Edgardo Alfonzo.

LEWINSKY LAWYERS OFFERS ADVICE TO BREAKFAST CROWD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' state news file.) 
BY PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
  Los Angeles -- Attorney William Ginsburg had an ironic piece of
advice Tuesday for anyone who might find themselves embroiled in a
scandal like the one that consumed his former client Monica
Lewinsky:
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't hire William Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most intelligent thing to do would be to get an
inside-the-Beltway lawyer to help you,'' the Sherman Oaks resident
said during a breakfast at the El Caballero Country Club, his first
speech in his old San Fernando Valley stomping grounds since the
case started.
</P>
<P>
   ``For these very, very high-exposure cases, very, very
high-exposure lawyers are probably the order of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   While Lewinsky's new Washington lawyers have been riding a wave
of success _ they secured an immunity deal for the former intern
last week _ Ginsburg had a less conspicuous victory: A jury found
the doctor he was defending in a medical malpractice not liable.
</P>
<P>
   In what was also his first speech since the immunity deal was
reached, Ginsberg gave credit to Plato Cacheris and Jacob Stein,
Washington lawyers who replaced the longtime Lewinsky family friend
in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it was the correct decision ... because they were
able to achieve something I couldn't achieve,'' Ginsburg said.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg made it clear at the beginning of his hourlong address
to about 150 members of The Jewish Federation/Valley Alliance that
he would not comment on his conversations with Lewinsky, her dress
that is reportedly being tested for semen or the president's
pending testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't stop him from praising, criticizing or making
personal comments about the high-profile players connected to the
case _ from enemies like Kenneth Starr and political pundits to
allies like Clinton and Lewinsky's new lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   He was particularly hard on Starr, suggesting at one point that
the independent counsel might have a grudge against the
administration that passed him up for a U.S. Supreme Court spot.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg also had many harsh words for the national media, which
he says alternately embraced and criticized him during his
five-month stint as the nation's most famous lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The philosophy seems to be, scoop or perish,'' he said. ``The
concept seems to be, Make the story happen, instead of, Get the
news.''
</P>
<P>
   While his comments were biting, Ginsburg seemed at ease Tuesday,
far away from the rugby scrum of cameras and reporters that he
barked at more than once in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The scattered press attending the breakfast _ mostly local
newspapers and television _ stayed at least 30 feet away, about 10
feet farther than the golf carts that buzzed by the attorney on the
other side of the country clubs's windows.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Jewish alliance were still picking at cantaloupe,
bagels and lox when he started his speech with a joke.
</P>
<P>
   During a trip through Northern California 15 years ago, Ginsburg
said one of his children asked about a revolving radar tower. The
boy's mother suggested that the younger Ginsburg ask his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``My 12-year-old son then sagely said, `I'm not sure I want to
know that much about it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   While many of his comments during the speech bordered on
self-deprecating, Ginsburg clarified afterward that ``looking back,
I don't regret anything I've done or anything I've said'' in
connection to the Lewinsky case.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he will regret some of the comments he made at the El
Caballero Country Club remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Just minutes after pledging not to talk about the intricacies of
Lewinsky's case, Ginsburg suggested a ``cure for an overdose'' of
the anti-impotence drug Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   ``With every prescription they should dispense a picture of
Linda Tripp to look at.''
</P>
<P>
   The comment drew the biggest laugh of the morning from an
audience that was mostly Democratic. There was little surprise that
the attorney was greeted so warmly _ in essence, Ginsburg was
playing to a home crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg made his name as a lawyer defending a pool company from
a small law practice in Encino, just down Ventura Boulevard from
the club.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg said he plans to stay in the area, even though he
expects his life will never ``get back to normal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here for 25 years and I don't plan on going
anywhere,'' he said before the speech.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Ginsburg made an even stronger endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``God bless everybody in the San Fernando Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg isn't the first attorney-turned-celebrity to speak for
The Jewish Federation. Daniel Petrocelli, who represented Ronald
Goldman's family during the O.J. Simpson civil trial, addressed the
group last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Klasky and Elaine Berke, both past presidents of the
group, said Ginsburg ranks near the top of the dozens of speakers
they've seen over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was a very refined speaker,'' Klasky said.
``Unfortunately the press made him out to be a buffoon.
</P>
<P>
   Berke added, ``He never let his speech become sordid or
undignified.''

POSITIVE TEST DOUBTED BY FREE HOUSE'S TRAINER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (bl)  
 By JAY PRIVMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A growing scandal involving a controversial drug has potentially
ensnared one of California's leading older horses, and Tuesday his
trainer expressed disbelief that the horse had tested positive.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is Clenbuterol, a powerful bronchial dilator that was
approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in horses less
than three months ago. The horse is Free House, one of the stars of
the 1997 Triple Crown and a leading contender for Del Mar's premier
race, the $1 million Pacific Classic on Aug. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Under California Horse Racing Board rules, the use of
Clenbuterol is allowed when training, but horses are prohibited
from having any trace of the medication in their system when they
race because it could enhance performance. The drug is intended to
treat allergic and infectious disorders of the lung to promote
easier breathing but can also be used to hasten recovery from
strenuous workouts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Free House, who finished second in last year's Preakness Stakes
and third in both the Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes, returned
from a nine-and-one-half month layoff to capture the Bel Air
Handicap at Hollywood Park on July 11. According to the colt's
trainer, Paco Gonzalez, investigators for California's racing board
told him a week ago that Free House had tested positive for
Clenbuterol in that race. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The news sent Gonzalez reeling. As the private trainer for Trudy
McCaffery and John Toffan, Gonzalez has a squeaky clean reputation,
and Tuesday he maintained that he had never given Free House any
Clenbuterol, not even for routine training, let alone the race. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to figure it out, but it is impossible,'' Gonzalez
said by telephone from his barn at Santa Anita. ``I don't believe
it. I don't know how it happened, and then for it to be Free
House.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under the racing board's rules, a horse is considered to have
tested positive _ and his trainer is subject to discipline _ only
if a second laboratory confirms the findings of the board's
official testing lab, Truesdail Laboratories of Tustin, Calif.
Gonzalez said that after he was told of the initial positive test,
a split sample of the horse's urine was then sent out for
confirmation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know which lab it went to for the second one,''
Gonzalez said Tuesday. ``I left it up to my vets to decide where to
send it.'' Dr. Jeff Oney and Dr. Sam Bradley are Gonzalez's
veterinarians. Gonzalez said he was led to believe it would take
two weeks to find out the result of the second lab's test. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clenbuterol has become a lightning rod for controversy in
California racing in recent weeks. Last Thursday, the racing board
announced in a news release that 17 horses _ in the barns of seven
trainers _ had tested positive for Clenbuterol. Those 17, the
statement said, had been declared positive by Truesdail, and
confirmed by a second lab. The horses had raced at the thoroughbred
tracks Hollywood Park and Golden Gate Fields and the harness track
Cal-Expo, in Sacramento, from May 16 through July 11. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The names of the trainers have yet to be announced because the
board is still compiling lab reports and other legal documentation,
according to Mike Marten, the board's public information officer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Marten said the news release about the Truesdail findings was
sent out in the meantime to discourage any trainer who might be
inclined to use Clenbuterol. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We put out a press release on May 21 saying we have tests to
find this stuff,'' Marten said. ``Two months later we're still
finding it. It is the belief of the board that people are not
taking it seriously that we are going to prosecute the cases.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Marten added that the board has a policy of not announcing any
positives until they are confirmed by a second lab, and he assumed
that the information on Free House got into the public domain
because of conversations Free House's owners and trainer have had
with people at Del Mar. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So far, according to the board, Truesdail has declared 20
positive tests for Clenbuterol. Seventeen have been confirmed, one
was not, and two are pending. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ What goes on in the weird and wonderful world of the
sex, drugs and rock'n'roll President, the willy-waving leader of
the free world? Obviously not sex, drugs and rock'n'roll as we know
it, captain.
</P>
<P>
   For here is a man who can take drugs and not inhale, have some
kind of physical contact but not call it sex _ Monica did not
inhale _ and seriously pretend that rock'n'roll means the
reformation of Fleetwood Mac.
</P>
<P>
   We are expected to swallow all this and carry on grooving away
because good ol' Bill is not such a bad boy really, and the good
ol' American economy is still doing OK.
</P>
<P>
   And swallow it we do. The tedious talk of oral gratification,
the discussion of the President's genitalia, the endless
explanations of obscure legal terms, have bored us into submission.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of Americans polled believe that Clinton did have sex
with Monica Lewinsky. So it seems that the majority of Americans
believe their president is a liar and are not bothered.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of pundits here also seem to think that Clinton's sex
life is his own business _ or maybe Hillary's _ and they don't
really care either, because an adulterous Democrat is better than a
repressed Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I do care, and for a long time I have thought that Clinton
cannot ride this one out.
</P>
<P>
   No one agrees with me, I know; but even if I am wrong, I wonder
how we have become so morally numb that we are prepared to go along
with this.
</P>
<P>
   If I said that all men are bastards, they only want one thing
and will use and abuse their positions of power to get it, you
might think I was a feminist.
</P>
<P>
   If I said that certain men have such appetites that they just
can't help themselves _ they lie to their wives and girlfriends,
and the more important they are, the more they think they can get
away with it _ you might assume that I was bitter and twisted.
</P>
<P>
   Feminists have, of course, been strangely silent on Bill's
behavior, not bitter and twisted enough for my liking.
</P>
<P>
   American feminism has shown itself, at least publicly, to be
even more class ridden than the British version. Clinton likes
women, goes the line, strong women; he even married one and has
promoted others. Therefore what Clinton does in the privacy of his
own office/hotel bedroom/back of car is up to him.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, just look at the women who have made the accusations:
Jennifer Flowers, Paula Jones and now Monica ``I am a pizza''
Lewinsky. They're clearly trash and, however much they are made
over, trash will out.
</P>
<P>
   Are we really to think that the lives of these kinds of women
don't matter? What sort of feminism is this, that deigns to protect
only those who least need protecting, and disses those from the
wrong side of the tracks?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, say those who support Clinton, maybe Monica enjoyed it.
These were relationships between mutually consenting adults.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is possible to ignore the power differential between a
president and an intern. In which case, why can't Clinton tell us
the truth?
</P>
<P>
   If he were to tell the American public tomorrow, ``Hey, guys. I
can't keep my trousers on, and you know that if you were in my
position you would be the same,'' then at least we would know which
ball park he was playing in.
</P>
<P>
   If Hillary really was a lesbian, or having affairs with his
young aides, as in ``Primary Colors,'' we could perhaps accept that
this open marriage was not a bad arrangement after all.
</P>
<P>
   But we know, don't we, what sort of men Clinton surrounds
himself with? Men who are happily instructed to order up women as
if they were fried chicken. I'll have a party bucket, please.
</P>
<P>
   Men such as Dick Morris, who once moaned about the fact that the
poor old President couldn't even get (oral gratification) in the
back of a limo these days; the man who once said ``Men are from
Mars, women are from Yellow Pages.''
</P>
<P>
   What depresses me about all those who would let Clinton off the
hook _ the
it's-not-the-sex-it's-the-lying-that-matters-and-we-all-lie-anyway
brigade _ is that yet again we have thrust down our throats the
view that male sexuality is somehow uncontrollable.
</P>
<P>
   The most powerful man in the world is reduced, even by his
supporters, to little more than a walking, talking phallus. Forget
the politics and Jesus, let us worship the sordid coupling of the
Yankee dollar and the wicked willy that can move it up and down.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the boy can't help it. Most of them can't, can they? Sex
makes their heads go funny. But if nations are to be governed by
talking sets of genitalia, why bother with policy at all? Why not
simply vote for the man with the wickedest willy of all?
</P>
<P>
   If Americans care more about having a little bit extra in their
pockets than the fact that they are represented internationally by
a known liar, then the business of politics has been successfully
replaced by business alone, and all talk of principle is entirely
worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Let the apologists for Clinton send their daughters to work for
men twice their age, whose wives don't understand them. Let the
feminists who find Clinton such a sex god, walk one mile in his
wife's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   My dream is, and I have it with upsetting regularity, is that
Hillary follows my advice (it is a dream, after all) and finally
has enough. She goes on TV and says, ``I am sick of the lies. I am
sick of him making me and all those other women lie. If you want
the truth, if you want to change America, then here I am. There is
a toll-free number, and you can make me your president simply by
ringing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The switchboard is jammed... and then I wake up and realize that
this is not going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   It looks as if Bill will stagger on with a ``he said, she said''
defense. Perhaps, at last, he has met his match in Monica. She says
she has lied all her life. He may understand that.
</P>
<P>
   This gigantic waste of time and money may be the result of an
office affair, but who ends up really paying?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's popularity is up, though his credibility is down. How
can that be? Do we like those who are weak because they remind us
of ourselves as they fumble and lie?
</P>
<P>
   I tell you who ends up paying. All of us _ because if the most
powerful nation in the world continues to admire a cheat and a liar
then we are all diminished.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't about sex. Clinton can have sex with Saddam Hussein
for all I care. It's about power, the power to get away with
anything.
</P>
<P>
   No one has that power unless others consent to it, and it looks
to me as if the majority of people both here and in the States are
in a mutually consenting relationship with Mr. President.
</P>
<P>
   I just hope that they get as much pleasure from it as the man
Lewinsky used to call ``the big he'' does. &QL;

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ What goes on in the weird and wonderful world of the
sex, drugs and rock'n'roll President, the willy-waving leader of
the free world? Obviously not sex, drugs and rock'n'roll as we know
it, captain.
</P>
<P>
   For here is a man who can take drugs and not inhale, have some
kind of physical contact but not call it sex _ Monica did not
inhale _ and seriously pretend that rock'n'roll means the
reformation of Fleetwood Mac.
</P>
<P>
   We are expected to swallow all this and carry on grooving away
because good ol' Bill is not such a bad boy really, and the good
ol' American economy is still doing OK.
</P>
<P>
   And swallow it we do. The tedious talk of oral gratification,
the discussion of the President's genitalia, the endless
explanations of obscure legal terms, have bored us into submission.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of Americans polled believe that Clinton did have sex
with Monica Lewinsky. So it seems that the majority of Americans
believe their president is a liar and are not bothered.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of pundits here also seem to think that Clinton's sex
life is his own business _ or maybe Hillary's _ and they don't
really care either, because an adulterous Democrat is better than a
repressed Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I do care, and for a long time I have thought that Clinton
cannot ride this one out.
</P>
<P>
   No one agrees with me, I know; but even if I am wrong, I wonder
how we have become so morally numb that we are prepared to go along
with this.
</P>
<P>
   If I said that all men are bastards, they only want one thing
and will use and abuse their positions of power to get it, you
might think I was a feminist.
</P>
<P>
   If I said that certain men have such appetites that they just
can't help themselves _ they lie to their wives and girlfriends,
and the more important they are, the more they think they can get
away with it _ you might assume that I was bitter and twisted.
</P>
<P>
   Feminists have, of course, been strangely silent on Bill's
behavior, not bitter and twisted enough for my liking.
</P>
<P>
   American feminism has shown itself, at least publicly, to be
even more class ridden than the British version. Clinton likes
women, goes the line, strong women; he even married one and has
promoted others. Therefore what Clinton does in the privacy of his
own office/hotel bedroom/back of car is up to him.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, just look at the women who have made the accusations:

   STAMFORD, CONN. _ Everyone, it seems, has an opinion about
Monica Lewinsky and the investigation led by Ken Starr into
allegations that she and President Clinton had some kind of sexual
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   But, as a sampling of conversations at a strip mall in Stamford,
Conn., suggested recently, the spectrum of views is wide.
</P>
<P>
   There are some common themes, however. Almost no one believes
the President was not lying when he said on television last January
that he had not had sexual relations with ``that woman.''
</P>
<P>
   The question, however, is whether Starr should continue to
pursue him and threaten his very presidency.
</P>
<P>
   To a surprisingly consistent degree, Americans are concerned
about the amount of money _ their money _ that has already been
spent on the probe, which at the last count had topped $40 million.
Even those who support the investigation balk at the cost of it.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Gentile, for example, who manages a local video shop, is
visceral in his distaste for the President. ``I think they should
throw his ass out of there, because he is a liar. I think he is
guilty,'' he vented angrily, before adding quickly: ``But I don't
think we should be paying for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary, a local school teacher, also worries about the expense.
``I think they should stop this, because they're spending so much
money.''
</P>
<P>
   And the same goes for Paula, a property manager in this East
Coast town located about one hour north of New York. ``I think they
should get on with the business of running the country, instead of
spending all this money on Clinton's sex life, '' she complained.
</P>
<P>
   Both women, who preferred to withhold their family names, fall
firmly in the ``leave-the-man-alone'' camp. Like many others
interviewed, they said that whatever happened between Lewinsky and
the President is no one's affair but their own and Hillary
Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested in who slept with whom, I'm just not,''
said Mary, adding a view that seems to be most commonly shared by
women: ``It's really between Hillary and Bill. If Hillary can deal
with it, then so should the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Gender, however, does not appear to determine the way Americans
think about the scandal. Lucia Hoffman, intercepted renting videos
for her children who are off school for the summer, believes Starr
is right to pursue the President, who, she said, had ``used his
power to press himself on co-workers and women.''
</P>
<P>
   She suggests the President needs professional help because he is
a ``sex addict.'' Mary also prescribes psychiatric treatment, but
for Starr, ``because he is obviously anal.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, a lot of Americans seem unable to settle in either
camp. Donald Winfield, who drives a truck for an electrical
contractor, believes that the President is a ``philanderer,'' who
has ``lied about this. And if the President has lied about that,
what else has he lied about in office?''
</P>
<P>
   Winfield believes the President should be ``punished.'' But
should he be impeached? ``Oh no,'' he answers quickly. ``I think
that would just bring shame on the country.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the chairman of the Senate judiciary
committee, a Republican, Orrin Hatch, appealed to President Clinton
to ``pour out his heart'' to the American people and held out the
prospect of mercy, he was not going out on a limb.
</P>
<P>
   He made a point of saying that his counterpart in the House of
Representatives, Henry Hyde, would probably agree with him. So
would a large number, perhaps even a majority, of Republicans both
in Congress and in the country at large.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone schooled in British politics, such an overture from
the opposition to get an embattled leader off the hook seems almost
inconceivable, still less when it comes from the chairman of a
committee that would constitutionally be his judge in an
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   If the leader of the ruling party has painted himself into a
corner, now is surely the time to go in for the kill, not extend a
helping hand.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, however, there are reasons of principle
and practical politics, why that argument does not apply.
</P>
<P>
   While the President is nominated and campaigns on a party
ticket, he becomes on election both chief executive, trying to get
legislation of his choosing through Congress, but also head of
state, duty-bound to represent not just his party, but the country.
Getting rid of a President thus becomes a national rather than a
party political issue.
</P>
<P>
   Even in an age notorious for popular cynicism towards politics,
politicians and (outside the Beltway) towards Washington and all
its works, Americans retain a respect _ even awe _ for the
institution of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Impeaching a president is not something to be undertaken
lightly, nor is it something that automatically generates popular
approval. Democrats as well as Republicans felt the loss after
Richard Nixon resigned under threat of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that the United States might lose two presidents
by impeachment, or the threat of it, is widely seen as a national
disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   What claim can the United States have to world leadership, even
to hold its head up internationally, if its leaders are judicially
and/or morally discredited?, is a view heard repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a pervasive sadness about Clinton's predicament
that makes even diehard Republicans want the allegations not to be
true; especially, they want him not to have lied.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton is genuinely liked and respected _ for his engaging
manner, his political skills, even his principles. There is regret
that someone so prodigiously talented should have got himself in
such a mess.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans, it must be said, also have selfish
practical reasons for wanting Bill Clinton to complete his term,
and not only because they have reached a modus vivendi with him in
Congress that is to their benefit as well as his.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton were to leave office for what are in effect moral
reasons, the Republican Party could be deeply and openly split
between those who wanted to go easy on the President, and those of
the religious fundamentalist tendency that wanted a stronger moral
line.
</P>
<P>
   The Moral Majority would be back with a vengeance, and the
ensuing divisions would persist through this autumn's midterm
elections probably until the next presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   That campaign is the other reason why Republicans are keen to
keep Clinton in office. Should he resign, Vice-President Al Gore
would automatically become president for the remainder of Clinton's
term. There would not be an immediate election. That would give
Gore a head start for the next presidential campaign in the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans would prefer to see Democrats fielding an Al Gore
who campaigns poorly and carries the liability of a tarnished
predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   They would then be able to unite against a Clinton legacy of
``sleaze'' and low morals and have a reasonable expectation of
victory.
</P>
<P>
   As incumbent, Al Gore would be that much more difficult to beat.
He might have learned how to campaign effectively and he might have
built up a political record of his own. (His wife, Tipper, is
already a formidable campaigner.)
</P>
<P>
   How far Republicans are motivated by considerations of high
principle as opposed to low pragmatism is open to question. But the
combination offers Clinton allies he sorely needs. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the chairman of the Senate judiciary
committee, a Republican, Orrin Hatch, appealed to President Clinton
to ``pour out his heart'' to the American people and held out the
prospect of mercy, he was not going out on a limb.
</P>
<P>
   He made a point of saying that his counterpart in the House of
Representatives, Henry Hyde, would probably agree with him. So
would a large number, perhaps even a majority, of Republicans both
in Congress and in the country at large.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone schooled in British politics, such an overture from
the opposition to get an embattled leader off the hook seems almost
inconceivable, still less when it comes from the chairman of a
committee that would constitutionally be his judge in an
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   If the leader of the ruling party has painted himself into a
corner, now is surely the time to go in for the kill, not extend a
helping hand.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, however, there are reasons of principle
and practical politics, why that argument does not apply.
</P>
<P>
   While the President is nominated and campaigns on a party
ticket, he becomes on election both chief executive, trying to get
legislation of his choosing through Congress, but also head of
state, duty-bound to represent not just his party, but the country.
Getting rid of a President thus becomes a national rather than a
party political issue.
</P>
<P>
   Even in an age notorious for popular cynicism towards politics,
politicians and (outside the Beltway) towards Washington and all
its works, Americans retain a respect _ even awe _ for the
institution of the presidency.

EXPOS BEAT DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ The Dodgers should be ashamed.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't blow a four-run lead in the eighth inning Tuesday
night to the Atlanta Braves or San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   The Montreal Expos are 30 games out of first place in the
National League East. Their entire payroll is just slightly more
than Gary Sheffield's salary for this year. The Expos are using
three rookie pitchers in this series you may never see again.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the Dodgers who appeared vulnerable in a 10-inning
5-4 loss in front of 10,515 at Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, who looked like contenders over the weekend while
splitting with the New York Mets, had gotten through the rough part
of this road trip with series against two clubs competing for the
wild card. Or so they thought. This was the first of nine
consecutive games against teams with sub-.500 records, and their
hottest pitcher, Chan Ho Park, was on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a team like the Dodgers or Atlanta or New York come in
here, everybody is so sky high,'' said new Dodgers shortstop Mark
Grudzielanek, who watched former Expos teammate Chris Widger single
home F.P. Santangelo with the winning run against Darren Hall (0-3)
in the 10th. ``It's a chance for players to maybe show off for
someone they might play for someday. To be on this side now is
weird, but we have to win these games. This was embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the Dodgers, 4{ games behind the Cubs in the wild-card
race, are expected to play without Gary Sheffield and Raul Mondesi
for the rest of the series. Sheffield began serving a three-game
suspension for his June 28 fight with Pittsburgh's Jason Kendall.
Mondesi, who hit two homers Monday, has returned to the trainers'
room with lower back pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a good time for this,'' said Mondesi, who doubled
home the Dodgers' second run before leaving the game. ``We had a
chance to build on something and blew it. But if I don't take care
of this now, I could be out for the rest of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without those two, the Dodgers should have run away with
this one. They built a 4-0 lead in the seventh on a two-run single
by Eric Karros off Mike Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   But Park, the National League Pitcher of the Month, faced four
batters in the eighth and did not retire any. He had a 4-0 record
and a 1.05 ERA in July, but suddenly he was mush, allowing two
walks and two singles. Through seven innings, only one Expos runner
had reached third.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a couple of spots in the game where he started to
lose his way, but he always regained his composure,'' manager Glenn
Hoffman said. ``Until the eighth he was pitching fine.''
</P>
<P>
   It was so quiet in the ballpark, you could hear the momentum
shift. It could have come in the top of the eighth, when rookie
Adrian Beltre was doubled off first on Charles Johnson's fly ball
to center.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it was a couple of blown chances to turn a double play
in the Expos four-run eighth.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Dodgers turned around after the inning, the lead
was gone. And without Sheffield and Mondesi, the heart of the
lineup was Trenidad Hubbard, Karros and Matt Luke.
</P>
<P>
   Now it was a fair fight.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Osuna gave up the game-tying run on Vladimir Guerrero's
fielder's choice in the eighth. The Expos had a chance to win it in
the ninth, but former Dodger Wilton Guerrero grounded out with the
bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   The seldom-used Hall retired the first two batters in the 10th,
then he walked Santangelo. Widger then drove the ball over the head
of Roger Cedeno in left for the game winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we came back last night I thought, `This is the
start,''' said Hoffman, whose team beat the Mets 8-5 after trailing
5-1. ``We have to win these games. There is no excuse.''

BOWA, EDMONDS ARGUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Third-base coach Larry Bowa and center fielder Jim
Edmonds exchanged heated words near the batting cage during batting
practice before Tuesday's game. &UR;  &LR; The dispute stemmed from a
disagreement over when Edmonds would take his turn in the cage and
the two cursed loud enough to be heard in the press box.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds and Bowa also had a problem last season. Edmonds heard
Bowa didn't like him, so he confronted the coach Bowa about it.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad sidelined: Left fielder/first baseman Darin Erstad did
not play Tuesday and will sit out today's game because of a
slightly strained left hamstring. He suffered the injury Monday
night beating out an infield hit in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up (Tuesday) and it was pretty sore,'' Erstad said. ``I
got treatment, but it's really tough to run.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are off Thursday, so Erstad is expected to return to
the lineup Friday in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   McDowell's condition: Jack McDowell (elbow) will throw a
sideline workout on Friday, at which point the Angels will decide
whether or not he is ready to go out on a rehab assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things he has to work on, and he knows that,''
Angels manager Terry Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Quick transition: Reliever Trevor Wilson didn't have much time
to get settled in after being promoted from Triple-A Vancouver. He
arrived Monday afternoon and pitched the final two innings of
Monday's 11-4 win over the Indians. He allowed one run and two hits
in two innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked what I saw,'' Collins said of Wilson, who was a
starter for the Canadians. ``He threw some good breaking balls,
especially the one he struck out (David) Justice on. And he's got a
strange delivery, which helps him be deceptive.''
</P>
<P>
   No pacing: Because of his elbow problems, second baseman Randy
Velarde played in only his fourth game of the season Tuesday, so
it's understandable his approach is a little different than his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The season is 162 games, so there's a tendency to pace
yourself throughout the season,'' he said. ``But I'm living proof
(that) one throw and it could be over. I've got to go out with all
the emotion I can and give the ultimate respect to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitor: Former Dodgers coach Mark Cresse attended the game with
about 300 children from his annual summer baseball camp.

ANGELS TRYING TO PART WAYS WITH FIELDER
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Cecil Fielder's baseball career had taken him to
Toronto, Japan, Detroit and New York before he came to Anaheim to
play with the Angels this year.
</P>
<P>
   However, the journey might be over soon.
</P>
<P>
   Fielder, 34, was on the bench for the third consecutive game
Tuesday night, and it was no coincidence. The Angels, according to
a club official, are trying to move Fielder off the roster to make
room for Todd Greene, currently at Triple-A Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether the Angels will trade Fielder or simply
release him. He is owed about $900,000 of his $2.8 million salary
for this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about anything,'' Fielder said before
Tuesday's game. ``I'll be all right no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   Fielder, though, is frustrated and confused about his situation.
He went into Tuesday's game with 17 homers, only two off the team
lead (Darin Erstad and Tim Salmon had 19). His 68 RBI were tied
with Erstad for the team lead.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Angels know that 29 of his RBI came in the month of
June. In April, May, July and August, Fielder has 39 RBI and is
batting just .169 with two out and runners in scoring position for
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any of us are completely happy with what we've
done, but we're a half-game out of first place,'' he said. ``You
can't worry about yourself when you're a half-game out of first
place.''
</P>
<P>
   With Erstad nursing a sore hamstring and Dave Hollins usually
getting day games off because of his diabetic condition, Fielder
might get a start today. But if not, Fielder says he'll live with
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the manager's decision,'' he said. ``He plays who he
wants on the field. All I can do is give my support. I can't rant
and rave.... This is a pennant race and I feel I can help. He feels
he's got to get somebody else in to get the job done. What can I do
about it?''

MUCH-BATTERED QUARTERBACK AND RAVENS COULD BE NFL'S SURPRISE TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTMINSTER, Md. _ When we last left quarterback Jim Harbaugh,
he was doing his punching bag imitation in Indianapolis. It got so
bad for both the 3-13 Colts and Harbaugh that the question around
the National Football League was what would happen first, the Colts
winning a game or Harbaugh losing a limb?
</P>
<P>
   When the former Bills quarterback Jim Kelly last season publicly
questioned Harbaugh's heart on a Buffalo television show, those
comments subsequently led to a fight between Harbaugh and Kelly
before a game in Indianapolis. Harbaugh broke his hand in the
scuffle and missed several weeks of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's comments seemed out of line then, and still do, because
last year Harbaugh took one of the worst beatings any quarterback
has ever had in a single season. But throughout the ordeal Harbaugh
never publicly complained.
</P>
<P>
   What physical abuse did Harbaugh play through? There was the
bulging disk in his neck. An ankle sprain. Was it three
concussions? Or four? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pounding after pounding after pounding. In the last three
seasons, Harbaugh has been sacked 113 times, second most behind
Jacksonville's Mark Brunell (122). Last year, playing behind two
rookies on a line that allowed a league-high 61 sacks, Harbaugh was
sacked 41 times, third most in the American Football Conference and
once every nine passes.
</P>
<P>
   But if there was a good side to the beating, it was that
Harbaugh got tougher with each hit. He has always been that way,
but the abuse added an even thicker layer to an already thick hide.
So when the Baltimore Ravens decided to part ways with Vinny
Testaverde, coach Ted Marchibroda wanted to bring in Harbaugh, whom
he coached when both were with the Colts. The Ravens traded for him
in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took a beating like I haven't seen in awhile,'' Marchibroda
said. ``But that's Jim. He's a tough guy. That's what we needed, I
think, a good mix of tough veterans and young players.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is what they have. Harbaugh leads one of the NFL's most
interesting teams, an intriguing blend of battle-tested veterans
and skilled youngsters, drafted by some of the best talent
evaluators in the game. The Ravens, who open the exhibition
schedule and their yet-to-be-named, $220 million football stadium,
on Saturday against the Chicago Bears, could end up as one of the
surprise teams of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our team is ready to turn the corner,'' Marchibroda
said. ``We've drafted well, we've picked up some good free agents.
We're a young team, but we also have some experience. We're ready
to make a run.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Baltimore's strengths is something Harbaugh appreciates
probably more than anyone else: a solid offensive line. The
second-year man Jonathan Ogden is a Pro Bowl tackle who reminds
some scouts of the accomplished Jumbo Elliott, currently with the
Jets. They also have solid players on the line in Orlando Brown,
Wally Williams and Jeff Blackshear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a beating when I was with the Colts,'' Harbaugh said,
``but when you're playing, when the adrenaline is going, you don't
think about it. Now, with this team, I hate to compare these guys
to the Colts, but this line is truly terrific. They're one of the
best in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the Ravens have a nice combination of experience
and young legs. Peter Boulware and Jamie Sharper are two good
linebackers entering just their second season. Tony Siragusa, the
wise-cracking defensive lineman, and cornerback Rod Woodson, who
spent most of his career in Pittsburgh before joining San
Francisco, are in their 9th and 12th seasons, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been very impressed with how we have drafted,'' said the
Ravens' owner, Art Modell, referring mainly to Ogden, Boulware and
Sharper. ``Our drafts recently have paid off better than any draft
or series of drafts I've ever been involved with in my 38 years in
the NFL. We've also done a good job in free agency. I'm very
optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest key to the Ravens' season will be the first
four weeks. They open at home against Pittsburgh on Sept. 6, then
are at the Jets and Jacksonville, followed by Cincinnati at home.
If Baltimore can at least split those first four games, it could
make the playoffs. Last season, the Ravens lost six games by a
total of 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   Harbaugh is ready to jump-start what has been a solid career
after last year's nightmarish season in which the Colts began 0-10.
Because of last year, his Captain Comeback image has been
tarnished. But it was Harbaugh who in the 1995 season was just a
desperation pass away from beating Pittsburgh and getting to the
Super Bowl. That season Harbaugh made the Pro Bowl by finishing
with a 100.7 passer rating, making him only the sixth player ever
to lead both the NFL and National Collegiate Athletic Association
in passer rating; John Brodie, Charlie Conerly, Tommy Kramer, Brian
Sipe and Steve Young were the others. Harbaugh is hoping to
recapture some of the magic.
</P>
<P>
   In that last playoff game, Harbaugh was hit on one play so hard
in the first quarter that he chipped his tooth and tore the entire
bottom of his lip. He came to the sideline, spit out a mouthful of
blood, got the lip stitched up, and was soon back in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what?'' Harbaugh asked, ``If you win the game, it
makes the pain all worthwhile.''  &QL;

<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Tim Salmon is like a fish out of water when it comes
to serving as the Angels' designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   A foot injury has forced Salmon to make the best of that role.
And Tuesday night he showed he's adjusting just fine with four hits
in the Angels' 5-4 win over the Cleveland Indians before 29,916 at
Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels rallied from deficits of 3-0 and 4-1 to win it, the
eventual winning run coming across on Gary DiSarcina's bloop single
to right field with one out in the eighth inning off Indians
reliever Doug Jones (0-1).
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus opened the eighth with a single and took second on a
sacrifice bunt by Matt Walbeck, setting up DiSarcina's game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   Shigetoshi Hasegawa (6-1) got the win in relief of starter Chuck
Finley (seven innings, four runs, eight hits), and Troy Percival
pitched the ninth for his 30th save.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, Salmon obtained a first baseman's mitt so he could
field throws during batting practice. That way he could have
something to do when he wasn't hitting in the cage.
</P>
<P>
   He had three singles and a home run Tuesday, the home run being
No.20 and his fifth in the past nine games. Salmon went 30 games
without a home run before his recent stretch of power. There is no
way to explain it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess if I could,'' Salmon said, ``I'd be Mark McGwire.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Salmon will take them when he can get them. His homer
Tuesday led off the fourth and started the Angels on their
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Finley struggled early, giving up two hits in each of the first
three innings as the Indians took a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, Omar Vizquel singled with one out and
scored when Manny Ramirez hit an 0-2 pitch over the fence in left
for a 2-0 Cleveland advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Finley managed to keep the Indians off the board in the second.
But in the third, Kenny Lofton used his speed to create a run.
Lofton led off the inning with a single and stole second. After
Vizquel struck out for the first out of the inning, Lofton stole
third. His 35 steals trail only Rickey Henderson (46) of the A's in
the American League.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez followed with a single up the middle to score Lofton for
a 3-0 Indians lead.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Indians starter Dave Burba kept the Angels from
scoring until Salmon hit a towering, 425-foot home run to left
leading off the fourth. Seven of his 20 homers have come against
the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians got the run back in the sixth, when Ramirez hit his
second homer of the game for a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Burba left the game after five innings with tightness in his
left hamstring, and the Angels immediately took advantage of his
replacement. Salmon led off the sixth with a single off side-arming
Steve Reed.
</P>
<P>
   One out later, Dave Hollins singled Salmon to second, but Glaus
grounded out on a check-swing for the second out of the inning.
Walbeck then came up with the big hit, an opposite-field, two-run
double. DiSarcina followed with an RBI single to tie the score at
4.

AFTER ONE SWEET SWING BY STRAWBERRY, IT'S A SWEEP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (updates with second game)   (bl)  
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ With one swing of his bat Tuesday night,
Darryl Strawberry provided the single moment that would define the
New York Yankees' regular-season dominance.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who had won the first game of a doubleheader
against Oakland, 10-4, trailed in the ninth inning of the second
game until Strawberry hit a game-tying grand slam. The Yankees
scored five more runs in the inning, the decisive run coming on
freakish play, and went to win, 10-5, to sweep the Athletics. The
Yankees are 80-24, and two-thirds of the way through the season,
they are on a pace to win 120 games.
</P>
<P>
   The former Yankee pitcher Kenny Rogers stifled the Yankees for
eight innings of the second game. But Tino Martinez and Tim Raines
opened the ninth inning with singles, and Yankee fans in the crowd
began to cheer.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry tied a major league record with his second pinch-hit
homer of the season. Both of them have been grand slams.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland closer Billy Taylor relieved Rogers and got Chad Curtis
to hit a roller to third baseman Mike Blowers _ and the ball went
through Blowers' legs, an error that loaded the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry emerged from the Yankees' dugout to pinch-hit for Joe
Girardi, the whoops getting louder.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor threw a slider for a strike and to run the count to 2-2,
and appeared to try the same pitch. Strawberry unloaded, and the
ball carried to dead center, as other Yankees burst out of the
dugout to watch it carry over the center-field fence. Strawberry,
who had also homered in the first game, grinned broadly as he
crossed home plate, having hit his 20th homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   One out later, Chuck Knoblauch singled and moved to second on a
balk. Derek Jeter hit a hard smash to second, and Scott Spiezio
speared the hard bounce and threw awkwardly to first base, where
Jason Giambi stretched out to make the catch.
</P>
<P>
   But as Giambi fell to the ground, Jeter kneed him in the head.
Giambi went down motionless _ he would be helped off the field _ as
Knoblauch scored. When play resumed, Paul O'Neill would homer, and
Tino Martinez would crush a two-run shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' manager is suitably impressed: asked about how well
his team is playing, Joe Torre recalled the 1976 Cincinnati Reds, a
team generally ranked among the greatest ever and the best of its
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we have better pitching,'' Torre said. ``The reason I sort
of think back to that club is they had so many ways to beat you.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre, a member of the New York Mets at the time, recounted the
various skills of the 1976 Reds, who finished that year with 102
victories and 60 losses and swept the Philadelphia Phillies in the
playoffs and the Yankees in the World Series. Torre recalled how
the Reds had intelligent veteran players, with speed and defense
and the ability to make big plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of ways,'' Torre said, ``we're similar to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The manager probably would not say such things if he thought his
players would drift into automatic pilot.
</P>
<P>
   But they have played purposefully since starting the season with
four losses in their first five games, concentrating on preparing
for each game and then executing what they practice with robot-like
precision.
</P>
<P>
   They don't relax, they don't retreat: Incredibly, the Yankees
have been ahead at one time or another in 97 of their first 107
games.
</P>
<P>
   They have lost back-to-back decisions only once since June
15-16, and they have not lost three games consecutively since the
season's first week.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees battered Oakland's Mike Oquist on Monday night,
winning 14-1, and they went right back on the attack in the first
game of today's doubleheader. Knoblauch, who had two home runs, a
double and five runs batted in Monday, slugged a home run to open
the game today.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might look small,'' Strawberry said, ``but he's got some
pop.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakland came back after Knoblauch's first-inning home run,
scoring three runs in the second to take a 3-1 lead. But the
Yankees answered immediately, Knoblauch again starting the rally
when he reached first base on an error.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter walked against Oakland's Jay Witasick _ who was
making his third major-league appearance this year _ and with one
out, Bernie Williams laced a run-scoring single through the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez walked, reloading the bases, and after Strawberry flied
out, Chad Curtis smacked a two-run single to center field.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry effectively clinched the game in the fifth inning.
After Williams walked, Strawberry blasted a two-run homer, his
fourth home run in his last four starts and his 19th of the year,
the most he's hit since hitting 28 for the Los Angeles Dodgers in
1991. It was also Strawberry's seventh homer in his last 23
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry likely will continue to get playing time for the
foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   Chili Davis, the projected designated hitter who is coming back
from ankle surgery, suffered what the Yankees hope is a minor
setback in his rehabilitation appearance with Class AA Norwich on
Tuesday night. He was removed in the midst of the game, with what
the Yankees termed ``normal stretching'' of the scar in his
surgically repaired ankle.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   RAMIRO MENDOZA (7-2) pitched six and one-third innings in the
opener and preserved the Yankees' bullpen for the second game. MIKE
STANTON pitched the final two and two-third innings, allowing no
hits or runs and striking out three, his best appearance since May.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees committed four errors in the first game, more than
they had committed in any other game this season. Third baseman
SCOTT BROSIUS was charged with three and has 21 for the season. &QL;

<P>
   Astro finally beats Marlins on road
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
MIAMI _ Shane Reynolds waited four years to win a game at Pro
Player Stadium. What was another hour and 57 minutes?
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds waited and waited Tuesday night for the rain to stop,
perhaps hoping it would wash away his bad luck in the so-called
Sunshine State. It was worth the wait.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros scored multiple runs in three innings, giving
Reynolds plenty of support in a 9-5 victory over the Florida
Marlins. It was Reynolds' first win in seven starts at the ballpark
formerly known as Joe Robbie Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good to finally get a win here,'' Reynolds said. ``You
can't help but think about it considering my record here. I was
going for my 13th victory, and that's supposed to be unlucky
anyway, especially pitching here. It's not that I pitched bad here
every time, just most of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   But not this time. What made the victory even more satisfying
was the fact he endured the lengthy delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``That might not bother some people, but I'm very
routine-oriented,'' said Reynolds, who has a career 9.10 ERA here.
``It was a little distracting for me, but there's nothing you can
do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds (13-7) didn't pitch one of his best games of the
season, but it was good enough to beat the Marlins and began to
erase the memories of Monday's ugly 11-3 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were really determined to win this game,'' Astros manager
Larry Dierker said. ``After the way we played yesterday, we weren't
pleased. Nobody felt like we played well.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was almost a total reversal, although the bullpen made
the ending more interesting than it needed to be.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Spiers, Moises Alou and Brad Ausmus each drove in a pair of
runs to help the Astros win for the 14th time in their last 21
games. With the exception of Reynolds and relief pitcher Scott
Elarton, every Astro who stepped to the plate got at least one hit
in a balanced 13-hit attack. Pitchers excluded, each Astro either
scored a run or drove one in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed a game like that,'' Spiers said. ``Especially after
yesterday and knowing Shane's history here. He got in a groove, and
we just kept pecking away at them. Everybody wanted to see Shane
get a win here.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Astros weren't offering support at the plate, they were
providing dazzling defense in the field. With the exception of
third-inning errors by first baseman Jeff Bagwell and Craig Biggio
_ on the same play _ there weren't any bad marks on the Astros'
defensive report card Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Spiers made his usual share of eye-opening plays at third base,
and Bagwell and Biggio redeemed themselves with some alert work in
the field. Bagwell recorded two unassisted line-drive double plays
_ the Astros notched three such DPs as a team _ and Biggio went
horizontal to steal a base hit in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense was big,'' Spiers said. ``Sometimes, you get a
little lucky. Those double plays got us out of a couple jams.''
</P>
<P>
   Both starting pitchers needed an inning to work out the kinks
after the rain delay, and the batters took full advantage of the
situation. The Astros scored two runs off Livan Hernandez (9-8) in
the top of the first, and the Marlins struck back for three off
Reynolds in the bottom of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Alou put the Astros on a top with a two-run double into the gap
in left-center field. He has seven RBIs in eight games against his
former team this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins ambushed Reynolds to take the lead in their half of
the first. Five of the first six batters reached base, including
Ryan Jackson, who singled home a run, and Kevin Orie, who belted a
two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this offense and defense _ guys were diving all over the
place _ if the pitcher can just keep it close and stay out there,
he's got a chance to win,'' Reynolds said.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez retired the Astros in order in the second and third
innings, but he ran into trouble with the bottom of the Astros'
batting order in the fourth. The Nos. 7 and 8 hitters _ Ausmus and
Tim Bogar _ each delivered RBI singles to give the Astros a 4-3
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to be a serious contending team, you have to
get production from everyone in the lineup, not just a few guys in
the middle,'' Bogar said.
</P>
<P>
   With some help from his defense, Reynolds made the lead hold up
by retiring the final seven batters he faced before Elarton
replaced him in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros padded their lead in the seventh on a two-run triple
by Spiers and Derek Bell's run-scoring double, which was misplayed
by Jackson in right field.
</P>
<P>
   Marlins left fielder Cliff Floyd singled home a run off Elarton
in the bottom of the inning, but the Astros reclaimed their
four-run cushion in the eighth on Ausmus' second RBI single of the
game, which ended well after midnight in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Henry closed out the game for the Astros, but it was hardly
a routine outing. The Marlins managed three hits off Henry,
including an RBI double to left by rookie first baseman Derrek Lee.

RED SOX HOLD OFF MARINERS

 RED SOX-MARINERS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Jack London Square. Disneyland. The Great Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   On every stop of this 14-day forced march on the far side of the
Continental Divide, the Sons of Jimy Williams Traveling Salvation
Show continues to win converts and ballgames by the bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Still ahead are four hot August nights in the blast furnace of
Texas, but the Red Sox bade farewell to the Pacific Coast with
equal measures of Flash and panache, edging the Seattle Mariners,
2-1, Tuesday night in what may have been the signature game of this
trip.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox are 6-2 on this odyssey, with the American League
West-leading Rangers ahead, after manufacturing the tie-breaking
run in the seventh on singles by Scott Hatteberg and Darren Lewis
sandwiched around a sacrifice bunt by Mike Benjamin and a timely
decision by Williams, who set Lewis in motion and avoided a double
play on John Valentin's ground ball to short, which scored
Hatteberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you get lucky, boys,'' said Williams, whose team has
more often than not designed its own good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``This felt like a little bigger game for some reason,'' said
Steve Avery, who rebounded from two dreadful outings to limit the
high-octaine Mariners to two hits, including Jay Buhner's 457-foot
home run, in six innings, then let Derek Lowe and Tom Gordon hold
the Mariners hitless in the last three innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in enough playoff games to know that these are how
the playoffs are going to be,'' said Avery, who annually went to
the postseason with Atlanta. ``Low-scoring, tight games where we're
going to have to rely on Flash in as hard a job as there is.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be ready for these.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon passed one of his stern-est tests of the season, subduing
the heart of what may be the league's most dangerous lineup while
barely showing a pulse in racking up his league-leading 32d save of
the season and 29th in a row.
</P>
<P>
   After Lowe set down all six batters he faced, aided by left
fielder Troy O'Leary's leaping catch at the fence on pinch hitter
Rob Ducey's bid for a tying home run, Gordon entered in the ninth
to face the top of the order.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon sent Joey Cora flailing at a third-strike curveball, but
Alex Rod-riguez worked Gordon for a walk after fouling off several
full-count fastballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing I could do about Rodriguez,'' Gordon said.
``He just worked the count. I fouled him off, fouled him off, but I
was getting a little nervous. By then, he'd seen all my pitches.
The last pitch, I was just a little unsure.''
</P>
<P>
   That brought up Ken Griffey, master of the Mariners' universe
and challenger to the home run king himself, Roger Maris. Griffey,
who has six career home runs off Gordon, had just two singles in
two games against the overshifted Sox defense, but when Rodriguez
stole second, he had the tying run in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   But Junior tapped a nasty curveball from Gordon to third baseman
Valentin for the second out, and Edgar Martinez was jammed on a
fastball and popped to Benjamin for the game-ending out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been in the playoffs, so I don't know what that
feels like,'' Gordon said. ``I knew this was a big game for us, but
I felt relaxed out there, as relaxed as I can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I threw everything I had out there. And Griffey was
probably the biggest out.''
</P>
<P>
   He usually is.
</P>
<P>
   While Avery was enjoying his best outing since he threw seven
shutout innings against the Mets in Fenway Park June 7, Billy
Swift, the Mariners' reclamation project, was having his way with
Red Sox hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Swift gave up a single to Lewis to lead off the game, then did
not give up another hit until Hatteberg's two-out single in the
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox tied the score in the sixth. Valentin hit an
opposite-field double to right with one out. He was trapped off
second on Mo Vaughn's comebacker to the mound for the second out,
but Nomar Garciaparra doubled high off the center-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared Vaughn thought the ball had left the premises, and
if Griffey, who barehanded it and fired a throw home, had hit a
cutoff man, Vaughn would have been cut down at the plate. But
Griffey overthrew both cutoff men, and Vaughn, on cruise control,
crossed the plate safely.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After months of shrugging off bad economic news from
Asia and a slowdown in corporate profits in the United States,
investors stampeded out of stocks on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average plummeted nearly 300 points, or
3.41 percent, and other market gauges were down sharply. While up
7.32 percent since the beginning of the year, the Dow is now down
9.1 percent from its peak on July 17.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, with its heavy weighting in
technology and financial stocks, is the only major index that can
be said to be in a correction. It has lost 11.3 percent of its
value from its July peak. Nasdaq lost more than 65 points on
Tuesday, or 3.54 percent. Even so, the index is up almost 14
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   There was no single reason identified as the culprit behind the
market's plunge. Rather, investors seemed suddenly to give credence
to a series of red flags that had been waving for some time.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the economic meltdown in Asia has translated into a
sizable drop in demand for American products. Economic growth in
the United States slowed to a 1.4 percent gain in the second
quarter, down from the 5.5 percent reported in the first quarter.
The strong dollar has wreaked havoc on companies doing business
overseas. Uncertainty over President Clinton's future in the face
of the Monica Lewinsky matter weighed on the market as well.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most significant was investors' sudden recognition
that earnings growth, the engine that powers stock prices, is
deteriorating at even the biggest and best-known American
companies. Combine this with an increasingly narrow stock market
advance _ more stocks going down than up _ and the outlook for
stock prices turns decidedly bearish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors are finally, finally starting to realize that
earnings growth has slowed,'' said Liz Miller, portfolio manager at
Trevor, Stewart, Burton &AMP; Jacobsen in New York. ``If you have a
weakening underlying economy, profits cannot keep going up.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in recent days, stock market stars such as Procter &AMP;
Gamble and Kellogg have disappointed investors with either
lower-than-expected earnings or warnings of bad news to come. When
the same blue-chip companies that have led the market to
unprecedented valuations begin to lose steam, investors sooner or
later take notice.
</P>
<P>
   There was no sense of panic reported among brokerage firms
Tuesday. Several brokers said that the feeling among their clients
was one of being resigned to a drop in stock prices. Nice though
the heady profits were, investors seemed to think that the stock
market was overdue for a fall.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did mutual fund investors appear to be crowding the
exits. Fidelity Investments, the mutual fund giant, reported that
more money went into funds across the company than left them.
``There was some small movement from equities to money-market
funds,'' said Anne Crowley, a Fidelity spokeswoman, ``but nothing
of consequence.''
</P>
<P>
   The question on everyone's minds Tuesday was where the market's
fall would end. Was this the beginning of an stock market
bloodletting or just a painful correction? A bear market is
considered to have started once stock prices have fallen more than
20 percent from their peaks.
</P>
<P>
   Following the rout on Wall Street, Asian markets were sharply
lower early Wednesday. Japanese stocks were down 1.13 percent at
midday, while Hong Kong stocks tumbled as much 2.5 percent before
steadying.
</P>
<P>
   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange topped 800 million shares,
the largest day of trading this year and the second biggest ever.
Investors fleeing stocks sought refuge in Treasury securities,
driving up the price of the benchmark 30-year bond and depressing
the yield, to 5.63 percent. But this flight to quality was somewhat
muted: bonds traded higher, at a yield of 5.56 percent, about a
month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Only time will tell, of course, whether the market will move
into bear market territory. In recent years, investors have
ploughed back into stocks whenever they have declined, a phenomenon
known as ``buying the dips.'' Whether these investors will once
again consider Tuesday's precipitous drop in equity prices a buying
opportunity remains to be seen.

   Stocks began to slide in earnest about noon, when Ralph
Acampora, director of technical research at Prudential Securities
and a longtime bull on stocks, was quoted as saying that the Dow
Jones average could drop 15 to 20 percent from its 1998 highs.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks in all industries took a beating. Those hit hardest were
the banks, down 5.5 percent on average, followed closely by the oil
service sector which lost an average 5.3 percent. Health care
stocks fell an average 4.4 percent, and airline shares lost an
average 3.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Warning signs that stock prices might have gotten ahead of
themselves had been evident for weeks, if not months. Before
Tuesday's move, the S&AMP;P 500 had gained 14 percent on the year. Yet
the earnings growth reported by the stocks in the index during the
first half of 1998 came in well below that gain, at about 4
percent. Something had to bring this disparity back into line and
that something was stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Add to this the fact that labor costs are rising at the same
time that intense competition among companies prevents them from
raising their prices to consumers and corporate profit margins look
particularly vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Another straw in the wind pointing to lower stock prices is the
growth in money supply, the total stock of money in the economy.
For the last 18 months, the broadest category of money supply,
known as M3, had been going straight up, reaching a 25-year peak of
8.9 percent growth came in April. Allowing money supply to grow
stimulates the economy and in turn the stock market. A slowdown in
money supply growth, if its turns out to be a long-term trend,
would have the opposite effect.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp-eyed investors may have noticed another sign that stock
prices had hit something of a ceiling. Premiums paid in corporate
takeovers had disappeared in recent months. Indeed, last week's
proposed acquisition of the GTE Corp. by Bell Atlantic offered GTE
shareholders even less than the market price.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, positive earnings surprises in the second quarter
were no longer producing outsized gains in the stocks of companies
reporting them. Indeed, companies with good news saw their stock
prices underperform the S&AMP;P 500. This was an about-face from the
same period in 1997, when companies posting unexpected earnings
gains 10 percent or more above the Wall Street consensus
outperformed the S&AMP;P 500 by 12.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One money manager thinks the market has simply worn itself out
moving to new highs in mid-July on a litany of bad news. ``Wed had
a big huge move relative to what had been happening,'' said William
Fleckenstein, president of Fleckenstein Capital in Seattle. ``When
you put that against the deterioration of the market itself, you
could build a case that the market has exhausted itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Painful though any fall in stock prices can be, some money
managers who had been quietly raising cash and taking stock market
profits were unsurprised by the move. To their view, such a drop
was not a matter of if, but when. And if it ratchets down the
exceedingly great expectations investors have come to look for in
stock market returns, these folks say, the market's fall will be
healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were seeing valuations that were absurd relative to
corporate earnings,'' said Elaine Hahn, of Hahn Capital Management
in San Francisco. ``But nobody wanted to listen.''

MARINERS HIT THE ROAD AFTER TWO-HIT LOSS TO BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ An emotional homestand came to an end Tuesday night,
one that saw the Mariners trade Randy Johnson for some peace of
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, they should have included a reliever in the deal.
The Seattle bullpen, specifically Bobby Ayala, wasted a sterling
effort by starter Billy Swift, serving up a 2-1 defeat to the
Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, losing for the first time in three games and
finishing 2-6 on the homestand, leave Wednesday for a nine-game
road swing through the Great Lakes region, stopping in Detroit,
Toronto and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Swift and Boston starter Steve Avery, two players who have known
better days in the National League, went back in time to serve up a
classic for a few hours at the Kingdome. They were terrific,
matching each other pitch for pitch into the sixth inning. Avery
retired the first 11 Mariners. Swift gave up a leadoff single, then
went 16 batters before permitting another.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the kinds of games you get in the playoffs,
low-scoring games,'' said Avery, a left-hander who knows about
these things from his Atlanta Braves days. ``These are the kind of
games you have to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference was Avery (8-4) got ample relief help. A former
Mariner, Derek Lowe, provided perfect setup duty, retiring all six
batters he faced. Closer Tom Gordon got three ninth-inning outs for
his 32nd save. Combined, the three Boston pitchers allowed just two
Mariner hits _ Ken Griffey Jr.'s single in the fourth and Jay
Buhner's home run in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, Swift's assistance was only temporary. Greg
McCarthy pulled him out of bases-loaded jam in the sixth inning,
preserving a 1-1 tie. But this reliever couldn't go it alone. Maybe
he should have.
</P>
<P>
   Greeted by boos, Ayala replaced McCarthy in the seventh, faced
with one out and a runner on second. It didn't take long for a
second chorus of crowd dischord to echo through the Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala's first pitch was laced into center by Darren Lewis. With
runners on first and third, he was touched for an RBI grounder by
John Valentin. The ball was punched up the middle, leaving
shortstop Alex Rodriguez with only a play at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's actually been good lately,'' Swift said of Ayala. ``He's
talked about how he finished strong last year. You give up a hit to
lose a game, that's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In the clubhouse before the game, Griffey kidded Ayala at length
about his lack of success this season. Griffey drew protests from
the reliever, who offered to show him the stat sheets. Ayala would
have lost there, too _ he leads the club in blown saves (6) and has
dropped seven of eight decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Quizzed about the right-hander's recent efforts, manager Lou
Piniella was protective as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby's been pitching better,'' he said. As for Ayala's
growing fan disfavor, the manager added, ``We should all be
united.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was scoreless until the fifth inning, when Buhner led
off with a long home run to left-center, his ninth. He reached down
to smack the first Avery pitch of the inning about 15 rows back.
</P>
<P>
   Avery, a lefty with no previous history of success against the
Mariners, made up for it, throwing a two-hitter in his six-inning
stint. He had masterful, not overpowering, stuff, walking just one.
The Mariners clocked his best fastballs at 84 mph, his slow stuff
at 75 mph. He used it well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's changed,'' Swift said. ``He used to be high, hard 90s. It
looks like he's learning to pitch. He really mixed it up well. He's
a Jamie Moyer-type guy now. Everything works off his changeup.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners had been two-hit only once before this season, by
Red Sox ace Pedro Martinez on April 11 in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Swift allowed a tying run in the sixth inning on Nomar
Garciaparra's double off the wall in right-center, scoring Mo
Vaughn. The right-hander, denied his 10th victory, gave up a
one-out double to Valentin and looked like he might get out of the
inning unscathed after a nifty defensive play. Vaughn hit one back
to the pitcher, who wheeled and caught Valentin in a rundown off
second.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, however, made him suffer. The Boston shortstop
jumped on a flat Swift slider and just missed a homer, rapping one
two feet below the right-field rail.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners now head East, running out of time, bravely
suggesting their season is not done. But stark questions persist,
such as why they are 4-19 in one-run games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's doing their job,'' Swift said. ``But when you're
in a funk, you're in a funk, and there's nothing you can do about
it.''

PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT? NOT FOR HAWKS' ROOKIE LINEBACKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHENEY, Wash. _ Ask DeShone Myles what he thinks of his first 2{
weeks of training camp and the Seahawks' rookie linebacker has an
instant reply: He's been thinking too much.
</P>
<P>
   Myles' game is speed and hitting. His forte is using that speed
to run down plays and run into players. When you're worrying about
always being in the right place and constantly making the proper
read, it can cramp your style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every now and then, I hit a wall mentally. I just get
brain-locked,'' Myles, a fourth-round draft choice from Nevada,
said after practice Tuesday. ``And the more you think, the worse
off you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Myles found a respite in the most unlikely venue _ Texas
Stadium, during the Seahawks' preseason opener against the Cowboys
last Friday night. He made a team-high four tackles, including
three solo stops, from his outside spot in the No. 2 defense, and
added another big hit while covering punts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was pleasing is it looks like DeShone is a gamer, a guy
who makes plays when he gets jacked up and gets the juices
flowing,'' defensive coordinator Greg McMackin said. ``DeShone did
things in that game that he can't always show in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   The play McMackin liked best was one Myles wasn't supposed to
make. After the Seahawks fumbled the ball away on the first play of
the second half, Cowboys running back Beau Morgan burst through the
line and ran for 23 yards. Myles pulled him down from behind at the
Seahawks' 4-yard line. His hustle not only saved a TD, it helped
the Seahawks hold the Cowboys to a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``DeShone's second effort gave us a second chance,'' McMackin
said.
</P>
<P>
   The glut of attention for rookies in camp has been focused on
first-round draft choice Anthony Simmons. First, because he was
signed and actually in camp when it opened July 19. Then, it was
his speed and play-making ability on the practice field. Now, it's
the sprained ligament in left knee, which will sideline the
linebacker from Clemson for at least three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But like Myles, others have shown they are locks to make the
53-man roster:
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Todd Weiner. The second-round draft choice from Kansas
State also was much better and more consistent in the game than he
had been on the practice field. Weiner continues to work behind,
and learn from, Howard Ballard at right tackle.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Ahman Green. As good as the third-round draft choice from
Nebraska had been in practice, he was even better in the game.
Green fumbled to open the second half, but he also had a dazzling
run to score a TD and finished with 63 yards on 14 carries. With
Ricky Watters around, Green's primary role will be returning
kickoffs and covering kicks.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Jason McEndoo. Drafted in the seventh round to be a deep
snapper, the guard from Washington State has struggled at times
with his speciality. But he is showing enough as a lineman to
stick, especially with the injuries to backup centers Frank Beede
and Greg Bloedorn.
</P>
<P>
   Even more rookies are challenging for roster spots, or at least
berths on the five-man practice squad that will be compiled after
the final roster cut on Aug. 30:
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Bobby Shaw and Chris Jackson. The Seahawks won't keep two
rookies as their fifth and sixth receivers, but Cal's Shaw and
Washington State's Jackson are making a solid case for filling one
of those spots by continuing to make plays in practice.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Michael Black. With Watters, Green and Broussard, there
isn't room on the 53-man roster for the free agent from Washington
State. But Black is showing enough production and versatility to be
a practice-squad player.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Chris Brymer. Of the rookie linemen, Brymer has been the
most impressive. The free-agent guard from USC makes up for his
lack of speed by being, in the words of offensive coordinator Bob
Bratkowski, ``a physical, snarly, aggressive guy.''
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Carl Hansen. He had a sack against the Cowboys, but the
sixth-round draft choice from Stanford must continue to improve his
technique and strength if he is to displace incumbent Riddick
Parker to be the fourth defensive tackle.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Reggie Lowe and Paul Spicer. When the coaches look at this
pair of free agents, they see a young Michael Sinclair, who has
developed into a Pro Bowl defensive end. Standing between one of
them and the No. 4 defensive end spot is Mike Croel, a former
linebacker and NFL defensive rookie of the year while with the
Denver Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't make a final judgment on one game,'' Bratkowski
said. ``But it's all been pretty good so far.''

MEDIA POLL PICKS UCLA TO WIN PAC-10 FOOTBALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When the media members who cover Pac-10 football
set out to name a 1998 conference football champion, they settled
upon a team that lost to graduation its top five tacklers and two
offensive stars who scored 37 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the holes, UCLA was selected narrowly over Arizona State
in a vote announced Tuesday at the Pac-10's annual media day.
Washington was third, followed by USC, Arizona, Oregon, Washington
State, Stanford, California and Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's great,'' said UCLA coach Bob Toledo, whose team
got 16 first-place votes and 284 points overall, to ASU's 14 and
281. ``I'd rather be in this position than be picked to finish
last.''
</P>
<P>
   The two co-favorites were the only ones to receive first-place
votes. Yet both have some considerable gaps to fill defensively.
Toledo, who also must replace offensive standouts Skip Hicks and
James McElroy, says the Bruins will have only two seniors among
four returning starters on defense.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State, meanwhile, could be lights-out on offense, but is
counting on a couple of junior-college players like linemen Junior
Ioane and Erik Flowers to contribute immediately, preferably as
starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``For them to have a real productive training camp is tough,''
conceded Bruce Snyder, the ASU coach, whose team opens with
Washington in Tempe Sept. 5. ``First-year players tend to go into a
survival mode, rather than think about improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know one thing. They look good.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington, on the other hand, has fewer question marks on
defense, is reasonably solid on both lines, and has a national
honors candidate at quarterback in Brock Huard. Its biggest
concerns are a gaping hole at running back and uncertainty at free
safety and wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at our offensive and defensive fronts, and that's a
good way to start,'' Washington coach Jim Lambright said. ``Then
you look at the decorated players that can have the greatest
impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Of concern to the Huskies is the status of linebacker Lester
Towns, who had foot surgery in April and had a protective boot
removed only recently. Lambright called Towns ``day-to-day,''
saying the foot was more sore than expected when it was freed up,
and ``that wasn't good.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Pac-10 race does boil down to UCLA and Arizona State, it
may not be settled on the field. For the second straight year, the
two schools don't play each other.
</P>
<P>
   COME TOGETHER: For the first time in his six-year tenure,
Lambright gathered his staff last week in Winthrop for a three-day
retreat that included river-running, horseback riding and skeet
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anything, (the retreat was) to establish personal
goals, and for the program overall,'' Lambright said.
</P>
<P>
   TIMEOUT: WSU coach Mike Price showed off what he said was a Rose
Bowl watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shorts me two seconds,'' Price remarked wryly. The Rose
Bowl game ended as WSU tried to preserve two seconds on the clock,
but time ran out.
</P>
<P>
   NOT ELIGIBLE: WSU defensive lineman Ing Aleaga was ruled
academically ineligible for the upcoming season. Aleaga, brother of
former University of Washington player Ink Aleaga, will still
attend WSU this year as a partial scholarship qualifier.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-2 Tim Lemon, out of La Mirada High School in La Mirada,
Calif., signed a contract with baseball's St. Louis Cardinals. He
had been projected to play at wide receiver for the Cougars.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Derek Dillon of Puyallup's Rogers High School
failed to receive a qualifying score in the SAT test, leaving the
Cougars with at least one scholarship to offer, according to WSU
coach Mike Price.
</P>
<P>
   Price said Steve Birnbaum, projected to replace Ryan Leaf as the

WASHINGTON LOSES TWO TOP FOOTBALL RECRUITS 
</HEADLINE>

 By BUD WITHERS  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two University of Washington freshmen football
prospects signed last February to national letters of intent,
including highly regarded linebacker Anthony Kelley, have failed to
meet NCAA qualifying standards and will not enroll at the UW this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley, a 6-foot-3, 215-pound product of Pasadena, Calif., who
committed to national champion Michigan and then reversed himself
to pick the Huskies, was one of the most prized recruits of the '98
UW class.
</P>
<P>
   The other signee who didn't make it is 6-2, 180-pound wide
receiver Antonio Cooks of San Francisco, whom the Huskies had
singled out as one of the best athletes to come out of the Bay Area
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they'd struggle to get it,'' UW coach Jim Lambright
said Tuesday, referring to the combination of test score and
core-class grade-point average. ``We were keeping our fingers
crossed.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambright said all other UW recruits have either qualified or,
in the case of two junior-college signees, defensive ends Roger
Faagata and Odell George, are on schedule to be eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Lambright said the status of cornerback Mel Miller would be
decided at a staff meeting Wednesday. Miller, who was suspended in
the spring for academic reasons and violation of team policy, is
likely to be reinstated.

SCIENTISTS USE SATELLITES TO TRACK FISH IN THE SEA 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID PERLMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    SAN FRANCISCO _ Armed with new electronic monitoring devices
that flash radio signals by satellite, marine scientists are
successfully probing the mysterious behavior of the fish that roam
the world's deep oceans.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists at Stanford University's Hopkins Marine Station, the
Monterey Bay Aquarium and the National Marine Fisheries Service
reported Tuesday that their new tools are successfully tracking
long-distance ocean travelers and revealing new aspects of their
little-known migrations as they seek warm waters across the
Atlantic and Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, researchers on land can now study the
migration patterns of great fish like the bluefin tuna, the
swift-swimming marlin, the swordfish and the sharks, and assess the
health of major commercial fisheries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new technology allows us to track animals that have been
untrackable until now,'' said Barbara A. Block of Stanford's
Hopkins station in Monterey. It will reveal the structure of fish
populations, their spawning sites and the ocean water temperatures
that are keys to their migratory routes, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers are using two remarkable new electronic tagging
tools containing tiny computers and radios that can ride with the
deep-water fish and store and transmit a variety of data.
</P>
<P>
   One of the tags, attached to a Styrofoam float, pops up to the
surface at a predetermined time and uses a tiny radio to transmit
information to shore-based scientists via the ARGOS satellite
network. It weighs only 21/2 ounces and is attached to a fish's
dorsal fin.
</P>
<P>
   The other device, implanted inside a fish's body, can store
records of the fish's location, its body temperature and its
swimming depth every two minutes for months, and can be retrieved
if the fish is caught.
</P>
<P>
   In the Atlantic, according to Block, one of the new tools has
already revealed crucial information about where and when the
endangered bluefin tuna travels from western to eastern zones of
its home ocean. The giant fish can weigh up to 1,650 pounds and
sells for up to $80,000 in Tokyo seafood markets.
</P>
<P>
   Because breeding stocks of the valuable species in both Atlantic
regions have declined by as much as 80 percent, fisheries managers
are already obtaining new information that will help them determine
catch limits so the breeding stocks can survive and increase, Block
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``And just being able to look directly at the large-scale
movement patterns of the fish for the first time, to understand
their behavior more deeply, is riveting,'' said Heidi Dewar, a
post-doctoral researcher at the Hopkins Marine Station.
</P>
<P>
   The two scientists, together with Charles Farwell of the
Monterey Bay Aquarium and Eric Prince of the federal Marine
Fisheries Service, reported on the development and successful use
of the new fish tagging devices Tuesday in the August issue of the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional tags placed on bluefin tuna have long been used in
efforts to determine their migration range. But tagging a fish in
one part of the ocean and recovering the tag, assuming the fish is
even caught, limits the information badly. In their report Tuesday,
Block and her colleagues say that only 13 percent of conventional
tags have ever been recovered, while in their first experiment with
the radio-equipped pop-up tags, the scientists recovered
information from 35 of the 37 tagged tuna.
</P>
<P>
   One bluefin the scientists tagged off Cape Hatteras, N.C., last
year was tracked across 1,670 nautical miles in the 90 days before
the tag was programmed to pop up to the surface, Block and her
colleagues reported.
</P>
<P>
   Block, who is co-director of the Monterey-based Tuna Research
and Conservation Center, was experimenting with the new tagging
technology in Hawaii this week, and said in an interview that one
of the new pop-up tags recorded a Pacific blue marlin that traveled
from Hawaii to equatorial waters warmed by El Nino west of the
Galapagos Islands _ a distance of more than 2,800 miles _ in 90
days.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10,000 temperature measurements of blue marlin have
been made so far. In the eastern Atlantic, the tags have shown that
where the fish traveled south, waters rose from 73 to 78 degrees.
In Hawaii, the satellite tags showed that fish moved from waters
where temperatures were as low as 78 degrees toward areas where
readings reached 82 degrees.

AUTOMOBILE BAN REJECTED IN PLAN FOR YOSEMITE 
</HEADLINE>
   By GLEN MARTIN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new plan to relieve traffic congestion in Yosemite National
Park calls for phasing in seasonal bus service but avoids the total
ban on cars demanded by the park's most ardent advocates.
</P>
<P>
   An advisory group convened by the National Park Service approved
a plan Monday during a meeting at Mammoth Lakes. The blueprint
calls for gradually introducing bus service into crowded Yosemite
Valley over the next 10 to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   If the plan is adopted by the park service, a two-year shuttle
bus project will begin next year, transporting more than 40,000
visitors with 16 buses annually from the park's four gateways to
Yosemite Valley. Eventually, expanded bus service could shuttle 1.4
million visitors per year into the park.
</P>
<P>
   The Yosemite Area Regional Transportation Strategies (YARTS),
composed of representatives from five Sierra counties, dodged the
option favored by many Yosemite preservationists _ a complete
year-round ban on private cars.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move would have been prohibitively expensive and
nightmarish to implement, said Jesse Brown, the project director of
YARTS and the executive director of the Merced County Association
of Government.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said such a ban would require a full-time fleet of about
350 buses that would cost about $215 million to purchase and $18
million a year to operate.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, said Brown, most of Yosemite's congestion occurs in
July and August. Vehicles are seldom a problem during other months,
and roads can become positively lonely in the winter, making bus
service unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Chip Jenkins, the National Park Service's point man on
Yosemite's transportation problems, acknowledged that the plan
``was not a utopian vision,'' but he said it was workable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a start,'' he said. ``What happened Monday was
extraordinary because we've been talking about regional
transportation for 20 years. For the first time, we have a game
plan. It gives people time to adjust, and it will make significant
strides in reducing traffic in Yosemite Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   If the plan is approved by the National Park Service as
expected, the two-year demonstration project will begin next
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everything works out as we hope, increased service will be
phased in,'' said Brown. ``We'll gear up incrementally.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Watson, the California/Nevada regional director for the
Wilderness Society, an environmental group that has been
particularly active in lobbying for Yosemite's preservation, called
the proposal a milestone.
</P>
<P>
   ``YARTS worked hard and traveled a long distance in a short
time,'' he said. ``Now we have a clear target to shoot for. In the
best of all possible worlds, I would have liked to have seen a
year-round alternative transportation system. But even if you deal
with the summer months alone, that's terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson said park advocates have ``hitched our wagon to YARTS,
and they've determined this is what's financially feasible. It can
start slow and grow over time.''
</P>
<P>
   Other environmentalists are more tempered in their enthusiasm
for the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased alternative transportation is moving ahead
for the park, but I'm worried about the voluntary aspect (of car
travel),'' said Janet Cobb, the president of the Yosemite
Restoration Trust, an advocacy group for the park.
</P>
<P>
   ``The National Park Service has blinked (by not promoting a car
ban),'' said Cobb. ``The public is ahead of the park service on
this. In a recent American Automobile Association poll, 60 percent
of the respondents said they wanted to get out of their cars while
in Yosemite.''
</P>
<P>
   Cobb said the park service needs to make driving more expensive
than taking a bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Incentives and disincentives are not covered in the YARTS
plan,'' she said. ``Right now, you can drive into Yosemite for $20,
but it costs $34 to take a (private) bus.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuolumne County Supervisor Mark Thornton also disliked the
proposal, although his reasons differed from Cobb's.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton was the only one of the six members of the YARTS board
to vote against the proposal. He believes that even the limited
transition from cars to buses puts too much of an onus on
surrounding counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to bear the economic, environmental and liability
costs of a National Park Service decision,'' he said. ``The bus
staging areas and parking lots for the cars in the gateway
communities will have a tremendous impact on land. Residents will
have to put up with bus fumes and noise. We may have to pay for
environmental impact reports associated with the bus service, and
we don't know what the effect will be on local businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Many businesspeople also disapprove of the plan. Car traffic is
essential to their livelihoods, they say, and the park service
should find means of relieving the congestion in Yosemite Valley
other than by bus shuttles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is just the beginning,'' said Paul Retchford, the
general manager of Tenaya Lodge, a resort near the southern portion
of the park. ``The goal is to remove all private vehicles from
Yosemite.
</P>
<P>
   ``This plan makes bus transport voluntary, but, if it's
approved, buses will eventually be mandatory. If visitation levels
go down, it will hurt all the gateway communities. About 88 percent
of Yosemite's visitors are from California _ and Californians won't
leave their cars. That's just the way it is.'' &QL;

ARTS(AT)LARGE 
 'EVIDENCE' OF A PROMISING DIGITAL ARTIST 
</HEADLINE>
  By MATTHEW MIRAPAUL 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The verdict is in, and based on the evidence, Maya Drozdz is no
Internet innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Works by Drozdz and five others are the winners, to be announced
Thursday, of the first annual digital art competition to be held by
Art &AMP; Science Collaborations Inc. (ASCI), a New York-based
organization that encourages technology-inspired creativity.
</P>
<P>
   In Evidence: Meditations on Small Objects, a Web-based project,
Drozdz is guilty _ to great effect _ of violating some of the
accepted precepts of how tales are told on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   From the ominous opening phrase, ``There is a body and someone
knows,'' Drozdz (pronounced ``drohsh'') recounts the history of a
relationship that has since ended, perhaps in violence.
</P>
<P>
   The multimedia short story plays out in a pop-up window that
covers about a third of the monitor screen. Clicking on highlighted
words, as well as certain images, reveals additional information.
As it accrues in the viewer's mind, a narrative-like chronology
begins to take shape.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Evidence'' departs in several ways from the conventions of
electronic storytelling on the Web and in other genres, such as
disk-based hypertext fiction, where the point-and-click technique
is a standard navigational device.
</P>
<P>
   Drozdz has programmed the piece so that the text, and thus the
linking options within it, unfolds over time. Clicking on the first
link choice that appears might eliminate later options, but waiting
too long may lead to one the work's 10 dead ends, forcing viewers
to go back or start over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guiding thing about hypertext fiction has always been
giving people more choices than a book would allow, so one of the
things I wanted to do was limit that,'' Drozdz said in a telephone
interview from her home in Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Druckrey, a Brooklyn-based writer on technology in the
arts who served as the competition's judge, said, ``The flow was
driven not by the typical 'click as fast as possible to make
everything possible happen,' but by a kind of pace that I found
really interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   The text in ``Evidence'' is actually rather sparse, closer to
poetry than prose. The idea for the work was sparked, Drozdz said,
by the author Italo Calvino's definition of the contemporary novel
as an encyclopedia that presents ``a network of connections between
... the things of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Drozdz has constructed the narrative of
``Evidence'' around a collection of otherwise unrelated items,
ranging from a lottery ticket to a pack of Indian cigarettes, that
she scanned into the computer and compiled on a desk in a fictional
apartment. Many are found objects, including a slew of photographs
scavenged from a darkroom garbage can.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is that the things in someone's life are telling the
story,'' Drozdz explained. In a subversive gesture, she has
designed the site so that many of the objects disappear when the
cursor touches them.
</P>
<P>
   In another departure, Drozdz adopted a color palette not usually
found on the Web. To help convey the piece's doleful atmosphere,
she has used highly saturated tones that verge on the lurid.
</P>
<P>
   Because these objects do not speak, things are left unsaid.
``Evidence'' concludes ambiguously, without confirmation that a
crime has been committed or that a culprit has confessed. The
objects fuel the narrative and the evidence is insufficient to
build a complete case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole Catch-22 with an encyclopedic novel is, when is it
comprehensive? I can't really consider mine finished,'' Drozdz
said. ``If you were to think about an apartment full of things, in
terms of being complete, it's not. There's an emptiness at the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even though its narrative energy is sustained
throughout, ``Evidence'' is less a gripping Raymond Chandler-style
mystery than a philosophical investigation into our attempts to
imbue objects _ and their digital representations _ with meaning.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to imagine ``Evidence'' being presented in any
other medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, we keep trying to replicate old traditions,
whether they be cinema or text or even hypertext _ and they're
really not adaptable,'' Druckrey said. ``So what I was looking for
were things that weren't just adaptations.''
</P>
<P>
   From the more than 90 international submissions to the
competition, Druckrey also selected Web works by John Maxwell Hobbs
and Mark Napier and digital prints by Kim Beckmann, George Laumann
and Sandy Young.
</P>
<P>
   ASCI was founded in 1988 by Cynthia Pannucci, a New York artist
and curator who continues to run the organization. The group now
numbers more than 200 artists, she said, and the members are
increasingly involved in digital art. As a show of support for the
genre, she decided to launch the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep hearing from the artists community that there aren't
enough galleries that are even willing to look at the work because
of misconceptions about marketability and the like,'' Pannucci
said. ``So, it's another venue. If the galleries aren't going to
look at it, at least let the public see it.''
</P>
<P>
   The winning entries will be displayed from Sept. 13 to Oct. 17
in the computer gallery of the New York Hall of Science in Flushing
Meadows, Queens. To promote the exhibition, ASCI will hold a panel
discussion on ``Collectibility and the Digital Print'' on Sept. 15
at Cooper Union.
</P>
<P>
   Drozdz does not think she can attend the gallery opening because
she will be starting the master's program at the Cranbrook
</P>
<P>
   Academy of Art outside Detroit this fall. She created
``Evidence'' as a final project for a humanities seminar at Cornell
University, where she graduated with a degree in philosophy earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Poland, Drozdz moved to the New York area when she was
11 years old. She now speaks without an accent and can converse in
Polish only with effort, the latter a development she seems to rue.
</P>
<P>
   ``English is highly simplistic compared to a language like
Polish,'' Drozdz said. ``Polish lends itself to poetry. I would say
it's a more highly evolved language because it's more complex.
There are many more grammatical and syntactical subtleties that can
be deployed.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the evidence, she has rediscovered some of those
subtleties on the Web.

EDUCATION  
 TOP UNIVERSITIES EMBRACE DISTANCE LEARNING 
</HEADLINE>
  By PAMELA MENDELS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the world's elite universities, freshmen in lecture halls
still face podiums presided over by a live professor and the
midnight bull session has not surrendered to the chat room.
</P>
<P>
   But slowly, top universities are introducing a virtual academic
experience to a subset of their student population: working adults.
</P>
<P>
   The point was driven home last month with the news that Oxford
University, one of the world's most renowned and tradition-bound
academic institutions, plans to launch two non-degree courses next
January that will be conducted over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to take what we offer to a wider audience,
especially remote areas of the United Kingdom such as the islands
of Scotland -- and to the entire world as well,'' said Antony
Sanderson, marketing officer for Oxford's Department of Continuing
Education.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford plans to kick-off its Internet offerings with two
courses, one in computing, the other in using technology to do
historical research. The computing course is targeted at those who
want to use computers more effectively in their work or are
considering a career in computing. The other is aimed at everyone
from professional to amateur historians who want to learn how to
use electronic data bases in their research.
</P>
<P>
   The classes will adapt Oxford's famous tutorial method, in which
a tutor works closely with students, to cyberspace. Each tutor in
the virtual classes will work with a group of 12 students.
</P>
<P>
   Those two classes, which are subsidized by private foundations
as well as the British government, will cost about 600 pounds for
residents of the United Kingdom and the European Community;
residents elsewhere will be charged more.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford is not the only institution to lend its prestige to
virtual education for adults.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford University, for example, has been offering
masters-degree engineering courses online for about four years. In
the fall, the university plans to launch a masters degree program
in electrical engineering that can be taken entirely over the
Internet, thanks to such technologies as streaming audio and video.
The program is aimed at working adults and adheres rigorously to
Stanford's standards, said Andy DiPaolo, executive director of the
Stanford Center for Professional Development and an associate dean
at the school of engineering. ``There is no asterisk in the diploma
saying you earned this is in a distance education program,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McGill University in Montreal offers two masters
degree programs, one in business education for students in Tokyo;
the other in occupational health for doctors working in Africa. In
both courses, students use online materials, but also have
face-to-face contact with their professors, who fly to the host
countries for periodic sessions with the students.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Harvard University's Extension School began offering
one of its computer courses on the Web. Lectures were digitally
taped and then posted on a Web site so students could both hear and
see the professor. About five cyber-students, including one in
Sweden, participated in the class. This fall, the university plans
to offer three more classes on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   At Duke University, executives can earn a ``global executive
MBA'' from the institution's Fuqua School of Business, in a program
that combines online learning with five live sessions with
professors and classmates in locations around the world. The
program costs about $86,000 and involves 19 months of course work.
</P>
<P>
   What all these courses have in common is an attempt to appeal to
busy adults who very much want to take courses, but find travelling
to conventional classes a major constraint. Among them is Dean A.
Butchers, a 37-year-old father of two and one of the students in
the Fuqua program. As worldwide marketing manager for mobile
options at IBM's personal systems group in North Carolina, Butchers
often travels for business, sometimes for weeks at a time.
Attending even a weekend MBA course would be out of the question
for him, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fuqua program _ which offers such features as Web-based
audio lectures and team projects conducted through chat sessions,
bulletin boards or e-mail _ is ideal for a man who can find himself
in a hotel room at midnight doing lessons. ``Any other type of more
traditional course would have necessitated my putting my career on
hold,'' said Butchers. ``As long as I have a telephone line and my
Think Pad, I can do my coursework.''
</P>
<P>
   As enthusiastic as they are about online ventures for older
students, university officials are less than gung-ho about the
virtues of virtual education for their undergraduates.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford officials say they have no plans to offer their coveted
undergraduate degree online. And neither do such notables as
Harvard University, McGill University, Stanford University or Duke
University.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for these institutions say they believe that a real
campus experience is an essential part of academic life for the
typical 18- to 21-year-old seeking a bachelor's degree. ``There are
residential requirements for an Oxford undergraduate,'' said
Jonathan Darby, director of the Technology-Assisted Lifelong
Learning program at the university. ``This comes from a belief that
part of what a degree from Oxford is about is soaking up the
atmosphere, working in the libraries, being part of Oxford college
life.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a comment echoed by others. ``We believe strongly that the
undergraduate experience should be an experience that is social,''
said Andy DiPaolo, executive director of the Stanford Center for
Professional Development and an associate dean at the school of
engineering.
</P>
<P>
   But some worry that after trying out online education in one
setting, universities will be tempted to begin using it in others.
James L. Turk, executive secretary of the Canadian Association of
University Teachers, is disturbed that some community colleges in
Canada may be using Internet-based courses to replace faculty and
fears that elite institutions could follow suit, seeing in
computers a way to cut teaching costs. ``The issue is whether they
can apply these technologies to undergraduate degree courses,'' he
said.

CYBERLAW JOURNAL  
 NEW ANTI-PORN LAW COULD PASS COURT TEST 
</HEADLINE>
  By CARL S. KAPLAN 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a landmark decision issued a little more than a year ago, the
Supreme Court declared that certain parts of the federal
Communications Decency Act (CDA), aimed at shielding minors from
``indecent'' material on the Net, cast a ``dark shadow over free
speech'' and abridged the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   But now, a new and more precisely-crafted law _ dubbed ``CDA
II'' or ``Son of CDA'' by critics _ that seeks to ease the high
court's qualms is making its way through Congress. And at least one
highly-respected legal scholar thinks the proposed law, which was
approved by the Senate last week in the form of an amendment to a
major spending bill, could pass constitutional muster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (CDA II) is a much closer question, and quite possibly
the Supreme Court will uphold it,'' said Lawrence Lessig, a
professor at Harvard Law School and a leading cyberlaw expert.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed law is sponsored by Sen. Dan Coats, Republican of
Indiana, and is awaiting House approval. It aims to keep children
away from smut on the Internet through a kind of 'virtual zoning.'
The original CDA, which Coats also co-sponsored, had a similar
goal, but it had at least three major flaws.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the original CDA provisions struck down by the
Supreme Court last June, in Reno v. ACLU, sought to restrict
``indecent'' and ``patently offensive'' speech. The court said
those terms were vague, undefined in the CDA and an inappropriate
censorship yardstick for the Net. A ban on transmitting or
displaying ``indecent'' material to children also posed an
unacceptable risk that socially valuable speech _ such as
information about birth control, homosexuality and AIDS _ would be
restricted.
</P>
<P>
   The high court also concluded that while Congress has a
legitimate interest in protecting children from harmful materials,
that interest does not justify an unnecessarily broad suppression
of speech addressed to adults. Yet the CDA would likely squelch a
large amount of sexual speech that adults have a constitutional
right to receive, the court said. At the least, adults' rights to
sexual, non-obscene speech would be unduly burdened.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, the court noted that the original CDA applied to all the
``democratic fora'' of the Net _ the World Wide Web, newsgroups,
chat rooms and e-mail. While the virtual 'adult-only' zone
described by the law might be economically and technically feasible
for commercial sex sites on the Web, that scheme could not easily
be applied to other sectors of cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   David Crane, legislative director to Sen. Coats, said the Reno
decision served as a ``blueprint'' for re-crafting the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Coats is fully confident the new law is
constitutional,'' he said. ``The best evidence we have of that is
the Supreme Court's opinion in Reno v. ACLU. The legislation
conforms tightly and directly with the court's opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the new proposed law targets a narrower category
of speech _ sexually explicit material that is ``harmful to
minors,'' said Crane. The harmful to minors standard, which has
been upheld by state and federal courts and is similar to some
obscenity statutes, is defined in the proposed law as material
which, taken as a whole, appeals to a minor child's ``prurient
interests,'' is ``patently offensive'' to a minor, and lacks
``serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.''
</P>
<P>
   A minor is defined in the proposed law as a person under 17 _
thus exempting college freshmen, who were liable under the original
CDA provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Other key features of the proposed law are that it pertains only
to ``commercial'' sites on the Web that sell or transmit material
harmful to minors. The proposed law does not target e-mail or
newsgroups. It also would not apply to parents who might send an
arguably raw sexual image or article to an older child _ a problem
with the old law.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the proposed law is not a blanket ban on the
transmission or display of harmful material, but rather requires
commercial sites on the Web to make sure their sexual images are
not readily accessible to minors, said Crane.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, the law encourages sex sites to keep all
smut away from minors by using so-called 'zoning' devices, which
may include a required credit card, a debit account, an adult
access code or adult identification number. Violators of the law
would be subject to a $50,000 fine for each crime and up to six
months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Most pornography sites on the Web already restrict access to
adult viewers by requiring a visitor to use a credit card to view
hard-core pornography, said Crane. The problem is that pornography
sites also display free 'teaser' images to lure customers into
spending money, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The object of the legislation is not to prohibit legal porn
sites...but require a porn site operator to put teaser images on
the other side of the wall,'' said Crane.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, say opponents of CDA II. On July 14, 13 free speech
and civil liberties organizations delivered to members of the
Senate a strongly-worded letter that said the proposed law
``contains many of the unconstitutional provisions'' of the CDA
that were overturned by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Barry Steinhardt, president of the
Electronic Frontier Foundation and a signer of the Senate letter,
said the proposed bill is ``a Trojan horse'' that could lead to
widespread suppression of protected speech for adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure (the proposed bill) is different in some respects,''
Steinhardt said. ``The problem is...that (its supporters) are
publicly suggesting the bill is targeted at commercial porn sites,
but the law is so broadly written, it could apply to...online
distributors of film, non-profit sites that have a commercial
component to them, even an online bookseller like Amazon.com.''
</P>
<P>
   An online bookseller, he explained, is a ``commercial'' site
that arguably sells materials that are ``harmful to minors.''
Steinhardt added that non-sex sites affected by the proposed law
would have to erect costly and burdensome adult-access gates or
``strip off'' the suspect material entirely, thus effectively
suppressing constitutionally-protected speech.
</P>
<P>
   Steinhardt added that the proposed law's definition of ``harmful
to minors'' is flawed because it doesn't require that the material
be judged against local community standards, as is the case with
obscenity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think CDA II is off the mark. I think we will prevail if we
need to litigate it,'' Steinhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Lessig said in an interview that he believed the
proposed law could pass the constitutional test because it is
tightly focused on the Web _ a part of the Internet where ``the
Court has already acknowledged it is technically feasible to
facilitate zoning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also pointed out that the 'harmful to minors' category of
speech, which has been endorsed by the Supreme Court in previous
decisions, specifically excludes non-pornographic material with
serious educational or other value to minors. In addition, he said,
the proposed law benefits from its narrow focus on commercial
providers of content _ though he agreed with critics that the
definition of ``commercial'' was fluid.
</P>
<P>
   The weakest part of the proposed law, said Lessig, is the
presumption that it is not too great a burden on an adult to go
through an adult-verification gate to view
constitutionally-protected sexual materials. But he added that he
believed the rights of adults would not be unduly restricted by
such a requirement, especially in light of the current rule that
adults need a credit card or other verification of their age to
listen to phone sex lines.
</P>
<P>
   Lessig, who previously served as an expert adviser to the judge
in the Microsoft antitrust case, is quick to point out that he
personally does not favor a tightly-crafted CDA II. He would prefer
a laissez-faire approach. But if the government must do something
to keep children away from pornography, he thinks a CDA II is a
lesser evil than the more omnivorous private blocking software or
PICS, a proposed labeling standard that could be used to rate and
block material on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between PICS and CDA II, I prefer CDA II,'' he said. ``I want
neither. It looks like we will get both, which is the worst outcome
as far as I'm concerned.''

TRAVEL LOG  
 MICRON LAPTOP'S BATTERIES STAY UP ALL NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  By STEPHEN C. MILLER 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Micron GoBook2 was a laptop that I was anxious to review.
Its major selling point is the claim that its batteries last for 11
hours, and I'm happy to report that the claim is true. Let me amend
that to say that the claim is probably true, but that I have never
had the stamina to last 11 hours. I did manage to use it on battery
power for almost eight hours before my bed beckoned, and the
batteries died while I was asleep.
</P>
<P>
   You might have noticed that I said ``batteries.'' In order to
get the extended battery life, you must purchase the optional base
battery pack, which attaches to the bottom of the GoBook2. The base
battery adds 2.4 pounds to the weight of the machine, bringing it
up to 6.8 pounds. Those who have been following this series of
reviews know that 7 pounds is my limit for the maximum weight of a
useable laptop.
</P>
<P>
   While the manufacturer says the base unit is optional, I think
it is a necessity. Without the base unit, the usefulness of the
GoBook2 drops dramatically. The battery that ships with the unit,
which lasts up to three hours on its own, must be installed in what
Micron calls the FlexOpt bay. This is a bay where you can connect
either a floppy disk, a CD-ROM drive, a second hard drive or the
battery.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the design of the GoBook2 is that if you
install the standard battery, you can't attach those other
peripherals. If you need to use one of them, you either have to
connect the AC power supply or attach the base battery. You can use
the floppy drive with the battery installed because it can also be
connected with a cable through the parallel port. But you would not
be able to use the floppy and the CD-ROM at the same time, because
the battery occupies the same bay.
</P>
<P>
   This is why I say you must buy the base battery, which lets you
do all of the above. In defense of Micron's designers, if you are
trying to manufacture a light laptop, you dump anything that adds
weight -- and a built-in battery compartment is going to add
weight. It is a logical compromise, but a compromise is still a
compromise, and this is one compromise I'm not happy with.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to give the impression that there aren't some
positives about the GoBook2 battery scheme. Micron did add a few
innovations to the lithium ion battery supplied with the computer.
One really nice advancement is the battery tester built into the
base of all the batteries. It's similar to the battery testers
found on the sides of some alkaline batteries. Simply by pressing a
button, you get an indication of how much power is left in the
battery.
</P>
<P>
   The GoBook2 also features a couple of innovations on the
keyboard. There are three programmable keys that let you launch
applications -- a really good idea. The only problem I had was
finding out how to program the keys, since the instructions were
not in the user's guide. I could only conclude that I had somehow
missed one of the manuals when I unpacked the computer. The call to
technical support put me in a 30-minute holding pattern, and more
urgent business did not allow me to hang on.
</P>
<P>
   One last thing about the GoBook's keyboard: it is very quiet.
One New York State judge will only allow reporters to use a laptop
in his courtroom if the keyboard is silent. The only one that seems
to pass his noise level test consistently is the Micron. If the
chip heats up, the sound of the fan is noticeable, but I was
impressed with how quickly it cooled the unit and turned itself
off.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, I'm neutral on the GoBook2. It has all the normal
advantages of a Pentium II processor. The 12.1-inch active-matrix
screen is sharp enough. The machine uses a touchpad as the pointing
device, but the keyboard is above average. Nonetheless, the battery
issue bothers me. For people who often find themselves in places
where power is not available, battery life is a major concern.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Reader Mail &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The column a couple of weeks ago about Personal Information
Managers (PIM) generated a lot of mail. Most felt the same kind of
frustration about being forced to switch programs. But I also got
this message from Cliff Counch, responding to my comment about
whether there was really a question about my switching to Microsoft
Outlook.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know _ IS there a question? If this is irony on your
part, it's a little too subtle for my blood. You can support the
superior product with your wallet, or else you can use the inferior
``free'' product and live with the results. Of course, once you're
left with no choice but the inferior product (because it's hard for
any company to compete with ``free''), you'll be kind of up a
creek, won't you. That's why I use a Macintosh desktop PC at home,
an Apple PowerBook as my second computer, and don't use ANYTHING
from Microsoft at work (on my mandated Wintel-PC) that I'm not
compelled to. But it's your choice to make and live with.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Cliff, the irony of the situation was not lost on you.
And the rest of your message makes clear the difficulty of avoiding
the ``free'' product, which really isn't free. Microsoft Office
Pro, which includes Outlook, retails for nearly $600. I'd have to
spend another $395 for a separate PIM, which really isn't all that
superior. I'm just used to it.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not quite clear how using a Mac will solve this problem. If
I want to do serious word processing and spreadsheet analysis, the
effective choices on the Mac are Claris Works and Microsoft Office.
Microsoft Office also dominates the Mac market.
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma is the same on the PC and the Mac.

THINK `THE END' IS NEAR? THINK AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We've been hearing lots of talk in recent days that the
investigation of President Clinton's sex life is nearing conclusion
_ that independent counsel Kenneth Starr will be wrapping up his
inquiry forthwith and reporting his findings to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   That's music to the ears of the many Americans who have had it
up to here with the sex-and-lies scandal that has dominated public
discourse in this country since January. Unfortunately, reports of
an imminent conclusion may be greatly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   Which shouldn't surprise us, since virtually everything we hear
about the Great Clinton Sex Probe of 1998 is greatly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   Take the infamous ``semen-stained dress'' that was in the news
and out of the news and now is in the news again. Monica Lewinsky's
much-discussed garment is being touted by some as the ``smoking
gun'' that could prove once and for all that Lewinksy had a sexual
relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the dress provides no such proof? Wouldn't that
suggest that the media and the public have been hoodwinked one more
time by whoever it is that keeps leaking erroneous and/or
misleading information about the investigation?
</P>
<P>
   If the dress is merely a red herring in an investigation replete
with red herrings, wouldn't the public be justified in suspecting
that the whole investigation is a sham?
</P>
<P>
   But back to the so-called imminent conclusion. It is true that
Starr seems to be nearing the point at which there are no more
witnesses to haul before the grand jury, no more rocks to turn over
in search of presidential sludge, no more phony ``smoking guns'' to
leak to the media.
</P>
<P>
   It is true, therefore, that Starr could be on the verge of
preparing a final report and turning it over to the House of
Representatives, which would then determine whether Starr has
unearthed any information that would justify impeachment
proceedings against the president.
</P>
<P>
   So this miserable ordeal is almost over?
</P>
<P>
   Not quite.
</P>
<P>
   Once the House gets Starr's report, the House might want to do a
little investigating of its own.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported that the chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee _ which would consider the question of
impeachment before turning the matter over to the full House _
believes that the House is ``not bound by Starr's findings, and
could decide to obtain evidence independently.''
</P>
<P>
   And the AP quoted a Republican committee member from Arkansas,
Rep. Asa Hutchinson: ``If I was the ultimate decider of facts, I
would want to see and hear key witnesses personally.''
</P>
<P>
   What we're talking about here, more than likely, is a nationally
televised dog-and-pony show featuring Monica Lewinsky, Monica's
mother, Vernon Jordan, Secret Service agents, assorted presidential
assistants and maybe even the president himself _ all testifying in
a pointless rehash of an investigation that has already cost the
taxpayers too much money and commanded too much of the nation's
time and energy.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the circus.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, don't imagine it. It's too disgusting to
contemplate.
</P>
<P>
   And for what purpose would the American people suffer such a
spectacle? To acquire previously unknown information about the
sex-and-lies allegations that have dogged the White House for six
months?
</P>
<P>
   Of course not. If any information or evidence exists that Starr
has failed to uncover during his exhaustive investigation, we must
assume that such information or evidence will never be uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly won't be uncovered by a panel of politicians
posturing for TV cameras in a self-indulgent attempt to show the
folks back home that they are putting Clinton's feet to the fire.
</P>
<P>
   If Starr's report contains serious and credible evidence that
Clinton has committed ``high crimes and misdemeanors,'' the
Judiciary Committee should vote articles of impeachment and send
them to the full House for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   If Starr's report does not contain such evidence, the committee
should file it and get on with the nation's business.

 The Woman Behind the Webbies  
 By Carolyn Said  c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tiffany Shlain may be the only woman in the world who has
Rudolph Guiliani and Willie Brown fighting over her. The mayors of
New York and San Francisco are vying to host the Webbies, the
annual awards ceremony for Web sites that Shlain produces.
</P>
<P>
   Held in San Francisco for the past two years, the Webby Awards
have tapped into the growing obsession with the Internet, garnering
media attention from TV, radio, newspapers and, of course, Web
sites. San Francisco and New York, with rival new media industries,
both hope to bask in the Webbies' glamour.
</P>
<P>
   The self-possessed Shlain ticks off her suitors' enticements.
``New York is offering Radio City Music Hall (as a venue for the
ceremony), and support to make the production happen,'' she said.
``But San Francisco is offering a lot of support through the
convention bureau, San Francisco Partnership and Multimedia Task
Force. ''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Brown was so worried that Shlain might yield to the Big
Apple's seductions that he assembled an ad hoc group of multimedia
mavens to keep the Webbies in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiffany Shlain has done a tremendous job as the city's digital
diva and we hope she will keep the awards where they belong,'' the
mayor's press office said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really appropriate to have an awards ceremony like this
in San Francisco, because this is ground zero for the Internet,''
said Mara Brazer, managing partner of the San Francisco
Partnership, a public-private economic development group.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco offered to tie the Webbies to a multimedia summit
or digital arts festival, set up a permanent exhibit to showcase
Webby winners, provide public relations and help find sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   With a combination of charm, persistance and an eye for what's
hot, Shlain, 28, has turned the Webby Awards into the Internet
equivalent of the Oscars, expanding the March event from a
600-guest ceremony in a nightclub at Bimbo's to this year's
2,000-person extravaganza at the Palace of Fine Arts.
</P>
<P>
   In the Webbies' first year, Shlain put together a first-class
show for less than $50,000, in part by attracting sponsors and
donations of products and services, said Michael Bayle, formerly of
The Web magazine, which started the Webbies. ``She took it from a
completely unsculptured idea and made something spectacular out of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiffany's a classic impresario,'' said Douglass Humphreys, CEO
of the San Francisco multimedia firm Skyrocket and co-chairman of
the Multimedia Task Force of the San Francisco Partnership. ``She
knows how to put on a show, she understands the marketplace and
she's very sharp. She has tremendous energy and great personal
charisma.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oscar producers could learn a few lessons from Shlain, who
brings her ceremony in at a zippy 60minutes by limiting acceptance
speeches to five words. (Sample: ``You ain't seen nothing yet.'')
</P>
<P>
   To pump up the glitter, Shlain lured celebrity judges for this
year's awards _ including Dennis Rodman, Jerry Brown, Barbara Boxer
and ``Dilbert'' cartoonist Scott Adams.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet community has responded eagerly to the event,
dressing up in ``future swank'' attire (tuxedos and ball gowns
mixed with piercings and tattoos), swigging vodka and boogieing to
a '70s band at this year's party.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the Web's egalitarian nature, upstart companies
competed head-to-head with giants _ and sometimes won.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco-based Cnet's News.com site won in the News
category, against the likes of ABCnews.com, MSNBC.com and the New
York Times on the Web. ``For people like us who do not have any
print or broadcast parentage ... winning a Webby gives us a stamp
of credibility and approval,'' said Jai Singh, editor of News.com.
</P>
<P>
   Shlain _ the daughter of a surgeon/ author and a psychologist _
brings a background in computers and creativity to her current
role. At 17, the Mill Valley native was a student ambassador to the
Soviet Union and launched a project to link U.S. and Soviet
students via modem connections.
</P>
<P>
   She studied film at the University of California at Berkeley,
where she was valedictorian of the Interdisciplinary Department.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating in 1992, she launched a career as a filmmaker,
designing Web sites and CD-ROMs on the side. One of her clients was
The Web magazine, published by International Data Group.
</P>
<P>
   WhenThe Web decided to launch an awards ceremony two years ago,
the editors hired Shlain to be its full-time executive producer and
creative director. The magazine folded just two months before this
year's Webby Awards, but IDG still owns the Webbies.
</P>
<P>
   Now Shlain is pushing the Oscar comparison a step further by
setting up an International Academy of Digital Arts &AMP; Sciences.
Like the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts &AMP; Sciences,Shlain's
digital academy will be selective (limited to professionals who
have helped advance new media) and will handle nominations for the
annual awards.
</P>
<P>
   She wants to turn the academy into a year-round organization
with a newsletter, conferences and lectures.
</P>
<P>
   Shlain plans to open the 1999 Webby ceremony to the public,
selling tickets for the first time. Discussions are under way about
a television broadcast of the event.
</P>
<P>
   Shlain, who hopes to make a decision about the Webbies' home in
the next two months, says she'll pick the city that is best for the
awards, but her heart seems to lie with the Bay Area. ``I am aware
that the home and foundation of the Webby Awards is in San
Francisco,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A compromise solution is possible. ``It's not a question of New
York trying to steal the Webbies; this is something (New York and
San Francisco) should be doing together,'' said Arlene Weltman,
vice president of the New York Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau. ``The
Webbies have what the multimedia industry has, which is huge
energy. They're very appealing.''

 RealNetworks' Plan Backfires  
 By David Einstein   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Confronting Microsoft can be bad for your corporate health, as
RealNet works chief executive Rob Glaser is discovering.
</P>
<P>
   One week after he blasted the software giant for ``breaking''
his company's software, RealNetworks' stock has fallen 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   RealNetworks is a pioneer of audio and video on the Internet.
Its RealPlayer software, which is free, lets Web users get
recordings and live broadcasts of news, sports, music and other
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   RealNetworks says its software has been downloaded more than 50
million times and holds a commanding 80 percent of the market. But
now, Microsoft appears to have set its sights on the little
Seattle-based company with a piece of software called the Windows
Media Player.
</P>
<P>
   Glaser, a mild-mannered former Microsoft executive, told the
Senate Judiciary Committee last Thursday that Microsoft's new
software _ which also is free _ disables the latest version of the
RealPlayer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Glaser complained that the Windows Media Player
automatically replaces earlier versions of the RealPlayer in a PC,
establishing itself as the default media viewer. If you want to use
RealNetworks' software, you have to start it manually.
</P>
<P>
   Countering Glaser's main allegation with a surprise parry,
Microsoft cited an independent study showing that the RealPlayer
contains a bug that causes it to break itself. RealNetworks denied
that, saying Microsoft's the one with the bug. The companies have
been waging a public relations battle over the issue on their Web
sites, www.real.com and www.mi crosoft.com.
</P>
<P>
   Glaser's accusations were supposed to give lawmakers ammunition
for widening the government's antitrust probe of Microsoft.
Unfortunately, they've backfired on RealNetworks by spooking
investors, who seem to have concluded that broken software is a bad
investment, regardless of who breaks it, and that Microsoft may
begin to eat into RealNetworks' market share.
</P>
<P>
   Since last Wednesday, RealNetworks' stock has fallen $15. It
closed down $1.13 yesterday at $29.
</P>
<P>
   The plunge has knocked the wind out of the company, which had
been riding high since going public last November. Its shares,
which initially were priced at $12.50, had climbed as high as $45
last Tuesday _ the same day it reported second-quarter revenues of
$15 million, 115 percent higher than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's critics will point to the battle with RealNetworks
as a textbook case of how the Redmond, Wash.-based powerhouse
subverts competition. Microsoft has been accused on several
occasions of licensing another company's software then
incorporating a version of the technology in Windows, the operating
system that runs nine out of 10 new PCs. With RealNetworks,
Microsoft both licensed the company's technology and invested in
it, buying a 10 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft doesn't deny that its Windows Media Player usurps the
operations of older versions of RealNetworks' software. And it
doesn't apologize, either. In fact, it wants its software to
replace most other media players, including the RealPlayer and
Apple's QuickTime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Windows Media Player has all the features found in each of the
other multimedia players, plus a whole lot more,'' the company
boasts on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Glaser's big fear must be that Microsoft could use its control
of Windows to do to RealNetworks what it already has done to
Netscape Communications. After Microsoft began bundling its browser
with Windows, Netscape's market share fell from 80 percent to less
than 60.
</P>
<P>
   To hear Microsoft tell it, however, it's not out to ruin
competitors, but rather trying to make life easier for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter that Microsoft posted yesterday on its Web site,
Windows marketing executive Yusuf Mehdi urged Glaser to bury the
hatchet and ``join Microsoft in returning to the mission that both
companies share: `providing great technology for consumers.'''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Glaser would like to put this episode behind him _
especially if it turns out that Microsoft is right and his software
has a glitch. The question is, can he make peace with Microsoft and
still keep his shirt?

 Making Meetings Merry  
 By Jamie Beckett   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When top executives at Yahoo get together for a high-level
huddle, they might do it in Frogs. Or Locusts.
</P>
<P>
   At Apple Computer, staffers can put their heads together in Play
Doh or Lincoln Logs. Meetings at Sun Microsystems may be in Wrigley
Field or even Yellowstone National Park.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley, where a whole new way of working was born,
even mundane office facilities like conference rooms have a
personality. That's especially true at go-go businesses like Yahoo,
where one building's conference rooms are named for biblical
plagues, or Cisco, where the rooms are named after comedians like
the Marx Brothers and Bill Cosby.
</P>
<P>
   But even at seemingly staid IBM, engineers joke about meeting in
Paris or Rio de Janeiro _ conference rooms inside IBM's Cupertino
offices.
</P>
<P>
   Such inside jokes may provoke a chuckle before an otherwise
tedious meeting. But they also are one way high-tech businesses are
fashioning corporate cultures that encourage new ideas, experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about making it fun to be there,'' said Sheila Adams
Hart, a psychologist who helps Silicon Valley executives with
interpersonal relations.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbing an otherwise stuffy conference room ``Bugs Bunny'' _ a
name chosen by both PeopleSoft, a Pleasanton-based software-maker,
and Netscape, the Mountain View Internet company _ encourages
people to relax, drop their professional demeanor and be more
playful and creative, Hart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It fosters the environment we believe in,'' said Corey Wong,
western regional real estate manager at Mountain View-based Sun
Microsystems. ``It gives people a sense of ownership and inclusion.
And it makes it fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the computer company's more than 100 Bay Area buildings,
people can meet in ``Toy Story''-themed rooms such as Buzz
Lightyear (soon to display artwork of the square-jawed hero),
``Star Trek'' rooms (a life-sized cutout of Spock adorned one) or
rooms named after such movies as ``Ben Hur'' and ``King Kong.'' Sun
also has less formal meeting areas with stereos and comfy chairs to
``stimulate communication and spontaneous thinking,'' Wong said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You show your corporate culture in everything _ the way the
building looks, the way people act, the names of the conference
rooms,'' said Joe Kraus, a co-founder of Excite, an Internet
gateway and search engine company in Redwood City.
</P>
<P>
   Besides conference rooms called goofy things like Tsar and Mr.
Swiss (the first e-mail handles of two founders) Excite's
headquarters building sports a screaming red-and-yellow interior
design and a real fire pole that gives the place a ``Romper Room''
feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies want to have some identity that makes them
special,'' said Jean Hollands, a Mountain View-based corporate
psychologist and executive coach.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, dubbing a conference room something memorable and
unique _ say, ``Three Amigos'' or ``Three-Ring Circus,'' both on
the third floor at Apple's Cupertino offices _ creates instant
history. A shared past is often lacking in an industry that's young
and fast-moving. That's one reason conference-room naming is rarely
a practice at older, more established companies with plenty of
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a place (the high-industry) where there's so little
stability and so much change, the names create a culture and a
tradition,'' Hollands said.
</P>
<P>
   The whimsical names also convey a message about the company _
usually something like ``this is a cool, hip place.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why employees at IBM's Java center in Cupertino proudly
broke tradition (Big Blue does not baptize rooms) and gave both
meeting rooms and laboratories silly names.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're bringing the Silicon Valley culture to IBM,'' said Rajiv
Jain, technical director at the company's Java center in Cupertino.
</P>
<P>
   The engineer-heavy group chose a characteristically precise
naming system, dividing their two-story building into four
quadrants matching four quadrants of a world map. The system makes
it easy for the geography-savvy to locate, say, the New Orleans
room on the second floor, west side.
</P>
<P>
   For those who don't know much geography, a map would come in
handy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's boring to have conference rooms with numbers and
letters,'' said David Ogden, PeopleSoft's historian.
</P>
<P>
   PeopleSoft, like many high-tech companies, allows employees who
work in each area to vote on the room names. Among the 40-plus
conference rooms scattered over its Pleasanton campus, PeopleSoft
has Goldilocks and Rapunzel (fairy tales), Humpback and Orca
(whales), Pebble Beach and Spyglass Hill (golf courses), Alcatraz
and San Quentin (prisons).
</P>
<P>
   ``Our employee base is really young, mostly people in their 20s
and 30s,'' Ogden said. ``They expect something less conservative
than you would find at a Bank of America or older company.''
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, the comically christened conference rooms become
an inside joke that makes employees feel they're part of a team.
</P>
<P>
   At Santa Clara-based Yahoo, meetings are held in rooms called
Decent, Disposed and Definitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love calling people up from the conference rooms and
saying, `Hey, where are you? We're all in Decent.' It always gets a
laugh,'' said Erin Moore, a producer in Yahoo's e-mail area.
</P>
<P>
   In another building, all 10 plagues are represented, but only
Darkness is decorated to theme, offering soft couches with pull-out
beds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a couple of people who booked it to take a nap,'' said
Moore, who helped with the selection process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says something about us. We're part of a new wave of
industry, a new generation of companies that are different from
older companies,'' Moore said. ``The names and the attitude are a
way of saying, `This is not your father's Oldsmobile. It's the
company of the 90s.'''

E-MAIL SOFTWARE FLAW LEAVES COMPUTERS VULNERABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MATT BEER   
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A security flaw found a month ago in several
popular electronic mail programs is shaking up the on-line world.
</P>
<P>
   The flaw, discovered by computer scientists at Oulu University
in Finland, has been confirmed by researchers at Microsoft Corp.
and Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, it's only a lab exercise,'' said Julie Herendeen,
Netscape's director of client product marketing, ``but it's a
serious one, and we're taking it seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The bug, called the longfile e-mail bug, works by way of e-mail
attachments and can erase files on a hard drive, crash a computer
and create general havoc on a desktop. Attachments are data files _
usually pictures or word-processing files _ sent along with an
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The malicious code, researchers say, can be hidden in the label,
or file name, of an attachment.
</P>
<P>
   According to both Microsoft and Netscape, the label to those
doctored attachments has to be longer than 200 characters. This
creates a buffer overload.
</P>
<P>
   A buffer is a chunk of a computer's memory that holds
information being used by a running program. Once the overload is
created, code contained in the label can run programs on the target
computer, programs that could erase files, crash the computer and
do other damage.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has confirmed that the flaw exists in its popular
Outlook Express and Outlook 98 e-mail packages used on Windows,
Macintosh and other machines.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape says it has confirmed the flaw on its Communicator
e-mail software for Windows-based computers only. A spokesman for
Eudora, another popular e-mail software, said it had not found the
flaw in its products.
</P>
<P>
   Though the longfile bug is still confined to computer
laboratories, Netscape, Microsoft and others are urging users to
fix their e-mail programs. ``The goal right now is to get this fix
out as fast and to as many people as possible,'' said George Meng,
group product manager of Microsoft's Outlook software.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty obscure, hard-to-use flaw,'' said Joyce Graff,
an e-mail security expert at the GartnerGroup, a technology
consulting company in Stamford, Conn. ``But people need to get it
fixed before it gets out.''
</P>
<P>
   Some predict the flaw will become a widely used Internet weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``People sort of assume they aren't going to get hit by this,''
said Eric Allman, chief technical officer at San Francisco-based
Sendmail Inc., a leading provider of e-mail software for Internet
service providers. ``But now that the crackers know what to do,
it's only a matter of time before they use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Crackers are those who use their computer expertise to damage
the systems of other people.
</P>
<P>
   Allman painted a bleak picture for the future of this flaw,
which he said could be sent to thousands of e-mail users. ``Its
only a matter of time, and not a lot of time at that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has posted fixes and more information at
www.microsoft.com/ie/security.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape plans to issue a fix within 10 days. It's posting
information about the bug at home.netscape.com/products/security.

LOOKING TO BE HOSTEST WITH MOSTEST 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JERRY ACKERMAN   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was only a matter of time, once interstate highways were
built, before roadside diners gave way to fast-food chains and
mom-and-pop motels were replaced by Holiday Inns, Radissons, and
EconoLodges.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is today along the Internet information highway, where
a battle is being waged for market share in a roadside service
called hosting _ storage of Web page text and other content for
retrieval by computer users at the click of a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Along with storage, some hosting companies see the field
evolving to include rental of specialized business software, on a
per-use basis, to customers who need these sophisticated programs
but can't afford their upkeep.
</P>
<P>
   The players range from giants _ such as International Business
Machines Corp. and GTE Corp., which got into the game last year by
buying BBN Corp. of Cambridge, Mass. _ to Sage Networks Inc. a
Cambridge start-up intent on building a national hosting company by
buying smaller operators, and tiny Taylor Group of Bedford, N.H.,
which is starting from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   The prize is a position in an industry that now has 4,000 to
5,000 hosting companies, which maintain the computers,called
servers, that store Internet data.While no single hosting company
is believed to hold more than 2 percent of the market, these
companies had combined sales of $400 million in 1997, according to
Forrester Research Inc. of Cambridge. That number is expected to
reach $1.9 billion in 1999 and $10.5 billion by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying this rapid growth is the surging interest in on-line
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic commercelast year chalked up more than $20 billion in
sales, two-thirds of that in business-to-business transactions.
Forrester figures that by 2002, this number could reach $350
billion, as existing on-line companies _ ranging from home-based
enterprises to pioneering bookseller Amazon.com _ are joined by
retailers such as L.L. Bean, Macy's, and Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the largest of these ``e-commerce'' companies manage
their own servers and networks. But some big players, and most of
the small ones, contract this work to hosting companies.
</P>
<P>
   These often are Internet service providers, many of them local
companies whose primary business is providing dial-up phone
connections to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But along with providing connections, they sell service packages
that _ for an average fee of $300 to $400 a year and frequently
much higher for large users _ store Web pages, execute orders, and
provide software to post purchases to buyers' credit cards while
transmitting deposits to sellers' bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Still waiting to be tapped, however, are thousands of firms that
have could sell their products or services over the Internet but
haven't tried, and others that have yet to exploit the World Wide
Web's full potential.
</P>
<P>
   Software products are coming out almost daily to ease the way,
says Joseph Barlett, an analyst with Yankee Group in Boston. ``Most
companies going with a hosting provider today are not very
sophisticated,'' he observes.
</P>
<P>
   But many that are very savvy are still hiring hosting companies
to help guarantee service quality for both external Internet pages
and intranet content meant only for employees' eyes. Boston Globe
Electronic Publishing Co., an affiliate of the newspaper, uses
servers at GTE in Cambridge for its boston.com on-line service. For
example, when a visitor to boston.com searches for a movie review,
he is tapping into GTE's servers for the stored information.
Texas-based J.C. Penney Co. uses another Cambridge Internet service
provider for much of its Web storage.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester says there were 12,000 such ``complex sites'' last
year, and predicts this number will grow to 20,000 by 2002. Many
will be managed in-house, but many more firms will be paying
thousands of dollars a year to hosting companies.
</P>
<P>
   Looking further ahead, the Internet is on the brink of opening
up new ways for companies to conduct their own internal financial
and production affairs, using software that until now only large
Fortune 500 companies could afford.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing this opportunity, major business software developers such
as Lotus Development Corp. (an IBM subsidiary), Microsoft Corp.,
and Great Plains Software Inc. are now market-testing versions of
their brand-name products for small companies _ firms with 500 or
fewer employees _ to use via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The concept calls for hosting companies to install master copies
of such specialized software, and then rent access to users.
International Data Corp. of Framingham, Mass. says 25 percent of
900 companies in a recent survey said they liked the idea for
payroll processing; others saw a need for such services for
economic forecasting or supply-chain management capabilities that
they now lack.

 UNDATED: ... they now lack. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The capabilities in this field are just emerging,'' said
Steven Brand, Lotus's manager for small business applications.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Forming a backbone
</P>
<P>
   Hosting as a growth business is sharply defined in the
``rollup'' strategy being pursued by Sage Networks, which since
March has spent more than $20 million to buy eight hosting
companies from coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   These acquisitions _ in Atlanta, New York, Washington, D.C.,
Dallas, San Jose, and Los Angeles _ form the backbone of what Sage
intends to be a national company that can establish brand identity
in a now-fragmented market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually think that through consolidation you can build a
large international company,'' said Bradley Feld, cochairman and
one of Sage's founders.
</P>
<P>
   By January, he said, Sage hopes to have between 15 and 25
acquisitions under its wing, with more planned for 1999. ``We are
now one of the top 10 hosting companies in the country and by the
end of this year should be one of the top two.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that this represents a big market share.
</P>
<P>
   Sage says it currently has tens of thousands of clients at its
companies; some estimate that number is less than 40,000. The firm
believed to be the nation's largest hosting operator, Hiway
Technologies Inc. of Boca Raton, Fla., claims 87,000 customers. And
the runner-up, Verio Inc., which has 125,000 customers buying
connections to the Internet, may be able to claim about 65,000 as
hosting customers, based on rules of thumb that industry veterans
say are commonly accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Both Hiway and Verio also are pursuing rollup strategies. Verio,
based in Englewood, Colo., is publicly traded. Hiway has an initial
public stock offering planned for later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Sage's buying spree has included a large, high-speed computer
center near Washington, D.C., purchased from IBM Corp., to be the
linchpin in the company's operations. A second center is being
built in Atlanta, where two of its operating units are also based,
at a projected cost of $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sage's money comes mostly from a venture fund managed by a New
York investment bank, Charterhouse Group International Inc.
Patricia Riley, managing director, says Charterhouse has ``well
over $40 million in pure equity'' committed to Sage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at this, you have a market that is growing
exponentially and a business that creates profits quickly,'' she
said. An IPO is planned, but no timetable has been set.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Pioneering at BBN
</P>
<P>
   GTE, an international telecommunications giant with $23 billion
in revenues in 1997, paid $616 million last year to buy BBN, which
in 1969, as Bolt, Beranek &AMP; Newman, launched the forerunner of the
Internet for the US Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
   Today, BBN operates under the name GTE Internetworking, still
running key portions of the Internet and selling services to
support its parent company's drive to compete against AT&AMP;T Corp.
and MCI Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're shooting to be a leader in the hosting market,'' says
John Vincenzo, a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Still under the BBN flag at the time, the company began
commercializing hosting operations at its 11 US locations in 1995,
according to senior product manager Christine Silva.
</P>
<P>
   Going first after large corporations that needed backup storage
capacity, the company last year expanded sales efforts to include
small and midsize firms _ companies with fewer than 500 employees
or sales less than $100 million. Analysts say this sector is where
electronic commerce is growing the fastest.
</P>
<P>
   Vincenzo said GTE now has more than 1,000 hosting customers. It
acquired one smaller hosting company, Genuity Inc., of San
Francisco, late last year primarily because it had a data center
that could be a GTE West Coast operations center. More acquisitions
are possible.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`Thin client' technology
</P>
<P>
   Coming from a different direction, Dan Taylor, a Bedford, N.H.,
software consultant, sees new computer hardware technology paving
the way for hosting centers to provide small businesses with
payroll, engineering, manufacturing control, sales systems, and
other software that they previously couldn't afford.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor says the licensing fees for these high-end products,
which big companies take for granted, weren't the problem.
</P>
<P>
   It was the cost of hiring someone to install the software,
manage its use, and install upgrades , in as many as 200 desktop
computers in a medium-sized firm. These information systems
managers, who can earn $80,000 to $90,000 a year, also must be
available around the clock to solve problems.
</P>
<P>
   The new hardware that is altering this picture is called ``thin
client'' technology, a name that refers to the fact that those
desktop terminals are stripped of their software storage
capabilities _ thinned down _ to become terminals that connect to
servers that function as a central computer.
</P>
<P>
   This may sound familiar to anyone who used a computer before the
PC revolution , when computer terminals were wired to IBM, Digital
Equipment, or similar mainframe computers that were tended behind
closed doors by technicians. ``The industry is calling it
recentralization,'' says Taylor of this return to the past.
</P>
<P>
   But by requiring that software be installed and maintained only
at the servers, operating costs plummet and fancy software becomes
more affordable.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor this fall will launch his first application of this
approach, installing accounting software in host servers at his
company's offices that nearby New Hampshire College will be able to
tap, via the Internet, for teaching its business courses.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, his company, The Taylor Group, is discussing the
hosting of specialized business applications with New Hampshire's
largest private manufacturing company, Cabletron Corp. of
Rochester, and with a Massachusetts health care firm, Physicians
Quality Care Inc. of Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating success in these pilot installations, Taylor
recently bought a 9.5 acres of land in Bedford where he plans to
build new offices for his 75-employee company _ with 10,000 square
feet of space set aside for a hosting center.

HIGH-TECH LOBBYING ALLIANCE MAKES BIG IMPACT IN A HURRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By ANDREW MOLLISON  
c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Last fall, the high-tech industry lost another
battle in its quiet legislative war against the nation's top
crime-fighters and code-busters.
</P>
<P>
   Four House committees had failed to agree on one of the
industry's top priorities: a bill to allow the export of powerful
software to protect electronic data with virtually unbreakable
codes.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by the setback, industry lobbyists began exploring a new
approach.
</P>
<P>
   It started with tentative discussions and a few phone calls.
Just 10 months later, it has grown into the biggest, best-funded
lobbying army in the tech industry's history, commanded by a
bipartisan team of political heavyweights and wielding a nationally
televised ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Now the coalition, under the market-tested name of Americans for
Computer Privacy, may be on the verge of extracting compromise
language from federal security agencies that could lead to new
legislation or a favorable re-interpretation of existing export
laws.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the effort may someday be cited as a textbook case of how
an interest group can use the traditional levers of Washington
power _ money, lobbying, public opinion and political connections _
to make the system work for it.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   For many years, the tech industry has sought federal permission
to export technology that will protect electronic messages and
records with the newest and strongest codes possible.
</P>
<P>
   They watched enviously as foreign software companies threatened
to capture markets around the world with powerful encryption
programs similar to ones that U.S. companies sell at home, but are
forbidden by federal law to sell abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robust foreign encryption is being so widely used that if U.S.
companies can't sell their products with encryption in it, they'll
either move production offshore or export product with a 'hole' in
it, so the user can plug in foreign encryption,'' said Jeffrey
Smith, a leading lawyer for the new coalition.
</P>
<P>
   But the FBI and the Defense Department's National Security
Agency have different priorities. They object to widespread sales
of codes so strong that they are unbreakable not just by
competitors, crooks and hackers, but also by law enforcement
agencies and American spies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing I'm going to agree to is that American
encryption gets used by terrorists overseas without any effort on
our part to control that,'' Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre
warned Fortune 500 technology officials in Aspen, Colo., last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Police and prosecutors are ``very much concerned about
commercially available encryption products being manufactured for
use in or imported into the United States that do not allow for
access to plain text by law enforcement pursuant to court orders,''
said FBI special agent Barry Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with such objections, Congress has consistently rebuffed
the tech industry's pleas to loosen export restrictions, including
the House committees' impasse last September.
</P>
<P>
   After that setback, Ira Rubinstein, a senior Microsoft Corp.
attorney in Redmond, Wash., and his colleagues conceived the idea
of a powerful new coalition to educate public officials on the
issue and put pressure on them to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   In a flurry of phone calls, the lobbyists from the world's
biggest software company refined the idea with their counterparts
at the biggest chip maker, Intel Corp., and the biggest computer
network firm, Cisco Systems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   They were encouraged by calls to and from other giants of the
high-tech industry and their network of allies among senators,
House members and congressional employees.
</P>
<P>
   Rubinstein was reluctant to claim personal credit for ramping up
the discussions, saying only that ``a lot of the people who staff
this issue know each other and talk to each other on a regular
basis.'' But others said Rubinstein took the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Some high-tech firms stayed aloof. They included IBM,
Hewlett-Packard, and other companies with more sympathy for the
views of their government customers or less interest in
mass-marketed encryption.
</P>
<P>
   But the coalition signed up many other high-tech firms whose
leaders see stronger codes as a key selling point for the next
generation of hacker-resistant communications systems.
</P>
<P>
   Even Sun Microsystems and Netscape Communications, both among
the fiercest competitors of Microsoft, jumped on board.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition was formally launched March 4 as Americans for
Computer Privacy, after focus groups responded well to the name's
positive connotations.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, Intel and Cisco agreed to be the coalition's biggest
funders. Representatives of 10 other high-tech companies and the
Business Software Alliance, which represents software manufacturers
in 65 countries, joined them on ACP's executive committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we had in common is, we all were being screamed at by our
customers ... who want us to fix this so that they can have secure
networks.'','' said lobbyist Dan Scheinman at the headquarters of
Cisco Systems in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the customers were eager to join as well. One was the
American Automobile Manufacturers Association. Its member firms
would like to cooperate on a cheap, more efficient system for
communicating with their suppliers around the globe _ but only if
each competitor could be absolutely certain that the other firms
couldn't decode its messages.
</P>
<P>
   Multi-industry trade associations such as the U.S. Chamber and
the National Association of Manufacturers, which together had 23
staff lobbyists working on the issue, joined. So did some smaller
business groups, like the Small Business Survival Committee, where
the only paid lobbyist is its president, Karen Kerrigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of small businesses in high-tech, and we're
concerned that government restrictions on entrepreneurs would crimp
job creation, so we agreed'' to join, Kerrigan said.
</P>
<P>
   Issue-oriented interest groups also climbed aboard. One early
member was Americans for Tax Reform, a Republican-subsidized
lobbying group whose president, Grover Norquist, has worked as a
part-time lobbyist for Microsoft. ``Our people don't want
government getting into their computers and reading their e-mail,
and they don't want overbearing, intrusive government regulations
destroying their sense of privacy,'' said Audrey Mullen, the
group's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Other ACP members include the National Rifle Association and a
pro-gun, antiregulatory group it helped start that bears the
politically useful name of Law Enforcement Alliance of America.
</P>
<P>
   Coalition organizers had a little less luck at the left end of
the political spectrum. The American Civil Liberties Union and two
leading cyber-libertarian groups, the Electronic Frontier
Foundation and the Electronic Privacy Information Center, endorsed
the coalition's efforts but refused to join.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's important to keep an independent voice for the
user community, and we differ with them on some details,'' said
Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information
Center.
</P>
<P>
   But the Center for Democracy and Technology, a nonprofit
spin-off started by former EFF and ACLU staffers, overcame similar
misgivings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We joined because we agree with their desire to fight against
any domestic controls on encryption and to promote export relief,''
said Alan Davidson, the center's staff counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in ACP has been so intense that the coalition, which
had only 26 potential members as recently as mid-February, has now
grown to embrace 40 associations, more than 90 companies and more
than 2,000 individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the deep pockets of its main corporate sponsors, ACP
has spent about $2 million since March, about half of it on cable,
print and Internet ads. It has enough corporate pledges left in its
war chest to spend another $3 million to $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ACP has assembled a top-dollar team of lobbyists, consultants,
lawyers, ad agencies, academics, webmasters and cybercasters from
the pool of professionals in the capital who shift smoothly between
government jobs and private for-profit and non-profit posts.
</P>
<P>
   The group's budget is not much by Washington standards _ no more
than half the annual lobbying budget of just one of its members,
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce _ but many of its members are already
well-connected. In addition to supporting ACP, they have given more
than $7 million in federal campaign contributions in the last year
and a half.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of ACP's organization chart sit a bipartisan pair of
generals, a typical feature of large-scale lobbying campaigns aimed
at both the Republican-controlled Congress and the
Democratic-controlled White House.
</P>
<P>
   Republican operative Ed Gillespie, ACP's executive director,
plays a ``Mr. Outside'' role involving public appearances and work
with sympathetic members of Congress. A veteran House staffer,
Gillespie is president of a public relations firm chaired by former
Republican National Committee Chairman Haley Barbour, a lobbyist
whose clients include Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic attorney Jack Quinn, ACP's general counsel and a
partner in the powerful Washington law firm of Arnold and Porter,
is ``Mr. Inside,'' in charge of executive-branch strategy. His most
recent government jobs include general counsel to President Clinton
and chief of staff for Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Under the guidance of its well-connected leadership, ACP has
focused its efforts where they could do the most good.
</P>
<P>
   Its lobbyists have conducted briefings in the offices of 230
House members and 30 senators, and its representatives have held
closed negotiations on a possible encryption compromise with a team
of officials from the White House and the Departments of Commerce,
Justice, Treasury and Defense.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of one session at the headquarters of the
National Security Agency in Maryland, those meetings have been held
in downtown Washington at the Madison Hotel or in the law offices
of Arnold and Porter.
</P>
<P>
   They don't have to disclose the contents of the talks because
the government participants were assembled by the Office of
Management and Budget and the National Security Council. As parts
of the White House bureaucracy, OMB and the NSC are exempt from
laws requiring open meetings and disclosure of information.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings are co-chaired by OMB technology chief Bruce
McConnell and Smith, the ACP lawyer who is a colleague of Quinn's
at Arnold and Porter. Smith served as counsel to the Senate Armed
Services Committee when its chairman was Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and
his most recent government job was general counsel of the Central
Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, the administration's attitude was that they could
block any legislation that didn't like, which was probably true,''
Smith said. ``But the marketplace is putting them under pressure to
compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   The ACP submitted its latest compromise offer in early May, and
posted a copy on its World Wide Web page
(http://www.computerprivacy.org). McConnell expects the
administration to respond by announcing a new position in
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in intense discussions not only with ACP, but with other
industry groups,'' said an administration official who declined to
be quoted by name. ``They have come up with some creative ideas for
addressing law enforcement's requirements, but we think that there
are are also national security issues left to be addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   That is consistent with the public comments of Hamre, the second
highest official in the Defense Department, which houses the
National Security Agency's vaunted code-busting machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The department is working very actively with law enforcement
and with (the) Commerce existing export laws.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the effort may someday be cited as a textbook case of how
an interest group can use the traditional levers of Washington
power _ money, lobbying, public opinion and political connections _
to make the system work for it.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   For many years, the tech industry has sought federal permission
to export technology that will protect electronic messages and
records with the newest and strongest codes possible.
</P>
<P>
   They watched enviously as foreign software companies threatened
to capture markets around the world with powerful encryption
programs similar to ones that U.S. companies sell at home, but are
forbidden by federal law to sell abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robust foreign encryption is being so widely used that if U.S.
companies can't sell their products with encryption in it, they'll
either move production offshore or export product with a 'hole' in
it, so the user can plug in foreign encryption,'' said Jeffrey
Smith, a leading lawyer for the new coalition.
</P>
<P>
   But the FBI and the Defense Department's National Security
Agency have different priorities. They object to widespread sales
of codes so strong that they are unbreakable not just by
competitors, crooks and hackers, but also by law enforcement
agencies and American spies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing I'm going to agree to is that American
encryption gets used by terrorists overseas without any effort on
our part to control that,'' Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre
warned Fortune 500 technology officials in Aspen, Colo., last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Police and prosecutors are ``very much concerned about
commercially available encryption products being manufactured for
use in or imported into the United States that do not allow for
access to plain text by law enforcement pursuant to court orders,''
said FBI special agent Barry Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with such objections, Congress has consistently rebuffed
the tech industry's pleas to loosen export restrictions, including
the House committees' impasse last September.
</P>
<P>
   After that setback, Ira Rubinstein, a senior Microsoft Corp.
attorney in Redmond, Wash., and his colleagues conceived the idea
of a powerful new coalition to educate public officials on the
issue and put pressure on them to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   In a flurry of phone calls, the lobbyists from the world's
biggest software company refined the idea with their counterparts
at the biggest chip maker, Intel Corp., and the biggest computer
network firm, Cisco Systems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   They were encouraged by calls to and from other giants of the
high-tech industry and their network of allies among senators,
House members and congressional employees.
</P>
<P>
   Rubinstein was reluctant to claim personal credit for ramping up
the discussions, saying only that ``a lot of the people who staff
this issue know each other and talk to each other on a regular
basis.'' But others said Rubinstein took the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Some high-tech firms stayed aloof. They included IBM,
Hewlett-Packard, and other companies with more sympathy for the
views of their government customers or less interest in
mass-marketed encryption.
</P>
<P>
   But the coalition signed up many other high-tech firms whose
leaders see stronger codes as a key selling point for the next
generation of hacker-resistant communications systems.
</P>
<P>
   Even Sun Microsystems and Netscape Communications, both among
the fiercest competitors of Microsoft, jumped on board.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition was formally launched March 4 as Americans for
Computer Privacy, after focus groups responded well to the name's
positive connotations.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, Intel and Cisco agreed to be the coalition's biggest
funders. Representatives of 10 other high-tech companies and the
Business Software Alliance, which represents software manufacturers
in 65 countries, joined them on ACP's executive committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we had in common is, we all were being screamed at by our
customers ... who want us to fix this so that they can have secure
networks.'','' said lobbyist Dan Scheinman at the headquarters of
Cisco Systems in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the customers were eager to join as well. One was the
American Automobile Manufacturers Association. Its member firms
would like to cooperate on a cheap, more efficient system for
communicating with their suppliers around the globe _ but only if
each competitor could be absolutely certain that the other firms
couldn't decode its messages.
</P>
<P>
   Multi-industry trade associations such as the U.S. Chamber and
the National Association of Manufacturers, which together had 23
staff lobbyists working on the issue, joined. So did some smaller
business groups, like the Small Business Survival Committee, where
the only paid lobbyist is its president, Karen Kerrigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of small businesses in high-tech, and we're
concerned that government restrictions on entrepreneurs would crimp
job creation, so we agreed'' to join, Kerrigan said.
</P>
<P>
   Issue-oriented interest groups also climbed aboard. One early
member was Americans for Tax Reform, a Republican-subsidized
lobbying group whose president, Grover Norquist, has worked as a
part-time lobbyist for Microsoft. ``Our people don't want
government getting into their computers and reading their e-mail,
and they don't want overbearing, intrusive government regulations
destroying their sense of privacy,'' said Audrey Mullen, the
group's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Other ACP members include the National Rifle Association and a
pro-gun, antiregulatory group it helped start that bears the
politically useful name of Law Enforcement Alliance of America.
</P>
<P>
   Coalition organizers had a little less luck at the left end of
the political spectrum. The American Civil Liberties Union and two
leading cyber-libertarian groups, the Electronic Frontier
Foundation and the Electronic Privacy Information Center, endorsed
the coalition's efforts but refused to join.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's important to keep an independent voice for the
user community, and we differ with them on some details,'' said
Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information
Center.
</P>
<P>
   But the Center for Democracy and Technology, a nonprofit
spin-off started by former EFF and ACLU staffers, overcame similar
misgivings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We joined because we agree with their desire to fight against
any domestic controls on encryption and to promote export relief,''
said Alan Davidson, the center's staff counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in ACP has been so intense that the coalition, which
had only 26 potential members as recently as mid-February, has now
grown to embrace 40 associations, more than 90 companies and more
than 2,000 individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the deep pockets of its main corporate sponsors, ACP
has spent about $2 million since March, about half of it on cable,
print and Internet ads. It has enough corporate pledges left in its
war chest to spend another $3 million to $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ACP has assembled a top-dollar team of lobbyists, consultants,
lawyers, ad agencies, academics, webmasters and cybercasters from
the pool of professionals in the capital who shift smoothly between
government jobs and private for-profit and non-profit posts.
</P>
<P>
   The group's budget is not much by Washington standards _ no more
than half the annual lobbying budget of just one of its members,
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce _ but many of its members are already
well-connected. In addition to supporting ACP, they have given more
than $7 million in federal campaign contributions in the last year
and a half.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of ACP's organization chart sit a bipartisan pair of
generals, a typical feature of large-scale lobbying campaigns aimed
at both the Republican-controlled Congress and the
Democratic-controlled White House.
</P>
<P>
   Republican operative Ed Gillespie, ACP's executive director,
plays a ``Mr. Outside'' role involving public appearances and work
with sympathetic members of Congress. A veteran House staffer,
Gillespie is president of a public relations firm chaired by former
Republican National Committee Chairman Haley Barbour, a lobbyist
whose clients include Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic attorney Jack Quinn, ACP's general counsel and a
partner in the powerful Washington law firm of Arnold and Porter,
is ``Mr. Inside,'' in charge of executive-branch strategy. His most
recent government jobs include general counsel to President Clinton
and chief of staff for Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Under the guidance of its well-connected leadership, ACP has
focused its efforts where they could do the most good.
</P>
<P>
   Its lobbyists have conducted briefings in the offices of 230
House members and 30 senators, and its representatives have held
closed negotiations on a possible encryption compromise with a team
of officials from the White House and the Departments of Commerce,
Justice, Treasury and Defense.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of one session at the headquarters of the
National Security Agency in Maryland, those meetings have been held
in downtown Washington at the Madison Hotel or in the law offices
of Arnold and Porter.
</P>
<P>
   They don't have to disclose the contents of the talks because
the government participants were assembled by the Office of

</P>
<P>
   The meetings are co-chaired by OMB technology chief Bruce

</P>
<P>
   ``The department is working very actively with law enforcement
and with (the) Commerce (Department) on a strategy that we think
will help break through this,'' Hamre said. He dropped hints that
in the administration's internal debates, he has argued that
foreign sales of the stronger encryption technology should be
phased in over several years.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Hamre told the Fortune 500 technology executives:
``I think that in the next several weeks, we'll be able to finally
hammer this out.''

Fastpitch online reaching world 
By Dan Moffett  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JUPITER, Fla. _ A great experiment in cyber softball is being
conducted in a small room at the town hall.
</P>
<P>
   From here, a 1,000-game tournament is being transmitted to the
world, one score at a time, one computer keystroke at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing quite like this has been tried before,'' said Melinda
Miller, the town's director of information services. ``We have had
to develop our own software. The response we've gotten has been
overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter, host city for the ongoing NSA Girls Youth Fastpitch
World Series, expanded its Internet Web site to provide tournament
results, highlights and features on participating teams. Under
Miller's direction, www.nsa-worldseries.com was born _ and to a
reception that was enthusiastic beyond expectation.
</P>
<P>
   Since the World Series began this week, the site has been
bombarded by more than 1,500 hits per day from across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traffic has been more than we can handle,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County tech companies have rallied to donate services
to deal with the surprising demand: Yonder Technology developed the
Web site, Klear Technologies created software for tournament
brackets, and Citywalk.net Inc. helped expand Internet capacity.
</P>
<P>
   At area restaurants _ Pizza Hut, McDonald's, R.J. Gators, the
Blarney Pub &AMP; Brewery _ computer terminals were installed so
players and their families could follow the series, which they are
doing.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail messages have come to Miller's screen from more than 40
states. Players who couldn't make the trip to Jupiter have sent
thanks for the chance to follow the games with the click of a
computer mouse.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite e-mail came from Mark Grcevich, who coaches the
18-and-under Nighthawks from Lowell, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   It reads: ``I can't thank you enough for what you are doing on
the Internet. Our team was going to play in the tournament but had
to withdraw ... because of a serious car accident involving three
kids from our team, including my daughter. So I have been following
the teams from our area.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller believes Jupiter has set a standard on how future
tournaments will transmit information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've changed the focus of communication from paper to the Web
site,'' she said. ``Cyber softball. I like that.''

VIRTUAL UNIVERSITY JUMPS TO THE TOP OF ITS CLASS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By GEORGE RAINE   
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Ten months after the California Virtual
University popped up on the World Wide Web, making the audacious
claim it could link students worldwide with unrivaled educational
opportunities, CVU looks like the team to beat.
</P>
<P>
   In the past six months, CVU has more than doubled, to 1,600, the
number of courses available electronically. At launch time, 65
accredited California colleges and universities appeared in the CVU
catalog. Now, there are 95.
</P>
<P>
   This growth, Gov. Pete Wilson said Wednesday, is only the
beginning. He believes there is almost unlimited potential for
long-distance higher education in California.
</P>
<P>
   California Virtual University _ a state-run Web catalog of
college courses offered on-line _ was turned over Wednesday to a
nonprofit foundation formed by educators.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson proposed the virtual university more than a year ago,
selling the project as a marketing tool for colleges and as a
career and skill booster to workers and employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means that when we speak of an information age, that is
not just a glib phrase,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all our wishes are granted, there will be a work force that
is better educated and has better access to higher education _ a
citizenry that can gain the skills to function in the knowledge
society which is upon us,'' said Carol Tomlinson-Keasey, vice
provost of the University of California and chairwoman of the CVU
Foundation Board of Directors.
</P>
<P>
   From the inception of the Web catalog, the state has believed
that its role should be minimal and that CVU should be directed by
educators. In its nascent period, it was given shape by teams of
teachers from the University of California, California State
University, California community colleges and the Association of
Independent California Colleges.
</P>
<P>
   An infusion of money accompanied Wednesday's spinoff from state
control. Redwood Shores-based Oracle Corp., with a $75,000
contribution, joined Sun Microsystems, Cisco Systems, Pacific Bell
and International Thomson Publishing as a founding corporate
sponsor of CVU.
</P>
<P>
   On-line courses have been available for some years, but are
growing rapidly in number and diversity. As many as 240 colleges
are expected to participate in the CVU within three years, said Jim
Highsmith, a CVU planner and immediate past president of the
Academic Senate of the California State University system.
</P>
<P>
   CVU's catalog (at www.california.edu) pulls into one
interactive, searchable forum the many on-line courses available.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The variety is extraordinary:
</P>
<P>
   _ The University of Southern California's Andrus Gerontology
Center (www.usc.edu/go/AgeWorks) is offering the nation's first
graduate gerontology program over the Internet. Topics include
successful aging and death and dying.
</P>
<P>
   _ Beginning this fall, Stanford University will offer courses
that lead to a master's degree in electrical engineering.
</P>
<P>
   _ Allan Hancock College in Santa Maria, a community college, has
three offerings: World Civilization Since 1500, PC Care &AMP; Upgrade,
and Financial Accounting.
</P>
<P>
   The CVU catalog lists more than 100 certificate and degree
programs. Most are in engineering, technology and sciences, but
there also are programs in the humanities, general education,
business, health, education, environmental studies, vocational
education and agriculture.

Against the Hall 
By I.J. Rosenberg  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Atlanta Journal-Constitution wanted to know how its Hall of
Fame rotation _ Tom Seaver, Ferguson Jenkins, Gaylord Perry and
Warren Spahn _ would match up against Mark McGwire on a computer.
So Diamond Mind Software (www.diamond-mind.com), which correctly
predicted the outcome of every game in the big series between the
Braves and Yankees in June, was called on once again.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' everyday lineup, with McGwire hitting third,
faced each of the Hall of Fame pitchers, with Rollie Fingers coming
on in relief. The computer company used numbers from the pitchers'
best seasons: 1981 for Fingers, 1974 for Jenkins, 1972 for Perry,
1969 for Seaver and 1953 for Spahn. The results were not good for
Big Mac. He went 2-for-16 with one home run and four strikeouts
against the Hall of Famers. He was 0-for-4 against Jenkins with one
strikeout; 1-for-4 against Perry with a double and run scored;
0-for-3 against Seaver with two strikeouts; and 1-for-4 against
Spahn with a homer and strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   He faced Fingers once, hitting into a double play.

ANOTHER BOWIE: WEALTHY WEB WIZARD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MICHAEL SAUNDERS   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Surprisingly few people scoffed when rocker David Bowie, known
more for his high-heeled antics in the '70s than his high-tech
forays in the '90s, announced recently that he was leaping further
into the digital ether.
</P>
<P>
   Bowie was one of the first celebrities to leverage his name and
sonic appeal into the wide-open Web with davidbowie.com, and
expands that foothold with the anticipated August launch of
BowieNet, an Internet service provider that will enable fans to
become citizens of a Bowie-focused cybercommunity. If successful,
Bowie could be at the forefront of a new kind of Web gathering, a
collective driven by the personality at its center.
</P>
<P>
   It's the latest shift for rock's reigning master of reinvention,
yet another permutation of the Bowie persona that has mutated
through Ziggy Stardust, the Thin White Duke, various glam rock
incarnations and now, to its current state, the Omniscient Elder
Statesman.
</P>
<P>
   At 50, Bowie is one of the world's richest musicians, with a
personal wealth estimated in excess of $200 million. He plans to
add to that with this new venture, likely to finance a few more
palatial villas in warm places.
</P>
<P>
   At $20 per month, the price is comparable with AOL and other
major ISPs and online services, but with full internet access
customized for Bowie fans. E-mail will be routed to
subscriber(AT)davidbowie.com, and a national scattering of points
of presence will allow users local-call dialup service.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the hook is Bowie himself, and the site intends to
feature exclusive Bowie content that should satisfy the most rabid
Bowiephile. The service's Web browser will be customized with
pictures, sounds, and graphics, likely similar in some ways to the
artistic use of simple design elements on the davidbowie.com site.
</P>
<P>
   Bowie shrewdly allied himself with industry players with the
tools to make such a venture work smoothly. The network
infrastructure is provided by Concentric Network Corp., of
Cupertino, Calif., with the whole deal orchestrated by a management
and technology partnetship called UltraStar.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.33l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Behind the name are two of the people most responsible for
Bowie's financial success: Robert Goodale, executive vice president
of Bowie's management company for six years; and William Zysblat,
co-owner of RZO, the firm that coordinated the innovative $55
million sale of bonds based on future royalties from Bowie's songs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
____ &QC;  One of BowieNet's partners is N2K, the online music
entertainment firm that established jazzcentralstation.com as a
major jazz content provider. Definitely worth clicking is the link
to milesdavis.com, which, as one might deduce from the URL, intends
to be a comprehensive and official Miles resource.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
____ &QC;  With each month, Yahoo! Internet Life extends its lead over
the chaotic field of Web-focused print magazines. It also proves
there's a substantial crossover between Web users who prefer to
retrieve their information on line, and diehards who swear by the
infinitely more portable dead-tree editions.
</P>
<P>
   The well-designed glossy anticipates boosting its guaranteed
circulation base to 600,000 by February, double the initial
circulation after its first year of operation. There's space to
grow within the genre, although two good-looking competitors folded
within a year: The Web Magazine, a promising venture that never
caught on; and NetGuide, which attempted to chronicle the Web's
spread and was bowled over instead.
</P>
<P>
   Like new growth springing up where old trees fall, several
ambitious magazines have joined the race to catch Yahoo! Internet

THROWING BABY OUT WITH THE SMUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those of us with monitor tans start getting nervous whenever
Congress takes up Internet legislation. And with good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Check out the latest effort to protect kids from on-line smut.
Last year the Communications Decency Act was gutted by the Supreme
Court, so Congress is trying to be a bit more creative this time
around. Last week, the Senate passed an appropriations bill with a
rider that will force schools and public libraries to use Internet
filtering software or lose their federal funding. Another part of
the bill will require that commercial Web sites with material
deemed ``harmful to minors'' must prevent minors from getting into
the sites.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sympathetic to the goal of this bill. There's some appalling
stuff on line, material that children have no business seeing. But
these proposals are a lousy way to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The mandatory filtering idea was proposed by Arizona Senator
John McCain, a conservative Republican who for some reason wants to
impose a sweeping federal mandate on thousands of classrooms and
libraries across the land. I favor blocking porn and violence on
school computers, and I think libraries should set limits on how
kids use their Internet terminals. But these institutions are
perfectly capable of working out for themselves the best ways of
doing this. The feds should butt out.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the plan to force Web sites to hide their seamier
material from youngsters. There's just one little problem: How?
Consider the on-line magazine Salon, a lively site with excellent
writing on politics and the arts. And yes, sex. Salon won't let a
week go by without a thoughtful but raunchy consideration of the
world's favorite pastime, written in a form that is definitely not
suitable for the kiddies.
</P>
<P>
   Because it's advertiser-supported, Salon is a commercial site,
subject to the new law. But there's no practical way to seal off
the naughty articles from the rest of the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, an effort to protect our children is going too far.
The Supreme Court should knock this one down, if the House of
Representatives doesn't scrap it first.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the House can be trusted to do right by the Internet.
Consider pending legislation that's supposed to fight the plague of
spam _ those unsolicited ads for porn and get-rich-quick schemes
that flood our e-mail boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an area that's ripe for federal legislation. It's already
illegal for businesses to send ads to your fax machine. Republican
Chris Smith of New Jersey proposes to extend the ban to e-mail.
This wouldn't do much to stop spam from other countries, but for
now it mostly originates in the United States anyhow. I think the
Smith bill is the best approach to spambusting.
</P>
<P>
   Yet thurda (July 30)the House is supposed to vote on a bill that
would effectively legalize spam. The legislation, drafted in the
Senate, would simply bar the common practice of using phony return
e-mail addresses in these obnoxious mailings. Spammers would have
to include a name, street address, phone number, and correct e-mail
address. Recipients of spam would thus be able to write back to the
sender asking them to stop, with stiff civil penalties if the
mailings continue.
</P>
<P>
   A fat lot of good that'll do. Even if spammers comply, they're
free to keep clogging the Internet with tens of millions of useless
messages. But we don't want to know who these guys are. We just
want them to stop. Bring on the Smith bill.
</P>
<P>
   Still, every now and then, Congress gets it right. On Tuesday,
the Senate Finance Committee approved a two-year moratorium on new
state and local Internet taxes. And the House backed a three-year
Internet tax moratorium last month. Everyone agrees that taxation
of Internet activity is coming. But there's a consensus that taxes
on this new industry should be delayed, until lawmakers know enough
to do it right.
</P>
<P>
   It's an outbreak of prudence and common sense, in the last place
you'd expect. Maybe I've been too hard on these guys.

THROWING BABY OUT WITH THE SMUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DOUG BAILEY   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   My ticket out of this Popsicle stand, I'm convinced, will be the
Academy Award-winning script I'm working on. I'll find the time to
finish it soon, sell it to Tinseltown in some major mega-deal
involving studio moguls and weasel agents, watch the thing get
produced into a boffo blockbuster, collect the dough and the
prizes, and then retreat to live happily ever after in wine
country.
</P>
<P>
   The finished product, currently with the working title ``Flying
High,'' will undoubtedly be written on one of two new scriptwriting
programs for the Macintosh that make it so easy to prepare
good-looking scripts that all you need is an idea. And ideas come
cheap, the programs don't.
</P>
<P>
   But in using them, you barely have to know the strict Hollywood
rules of script formatting because everything is done for you. Type
a character's name and the program stores it away so the next time
you need only to strike one letter and, wham, the whole name
appears and you're ready to start typing dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   There's no need to remember camera angles, stage commands, or
scene headings because the programs offer menus and other speedy
tricks to take care of all that, leaving you more time to think
about what you want to write. They automatically number scenes,
pages, and acts as well as allow you to write notes in the margins
or paste in footnotes.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, you don't even have to know how to spell or use big words
(a plus in Hollywood circles) because the programs come with
powerful spell checkers and a huge Thesaurus.
</P>
<P>
   The newest scriptwriting program on the Macintosh market is
Scriptware, by Cinovision Inc., of Boulder, Colo. The company says
its product is already the best-selling scriptwriting program for
Windows and is the software of choice at Universal, Warner
Brothers, and Paramount Studios and for over 80 TV shows and
movies, including ``The X-Files,'' ``Millennium,'' ``Cosby,''
``Murphy Brown,'' ``Cybill,'' ``Deep Space Nine,'' and ``Veronica's
Closet.''
</P>
<P>
   I've never seen any of those shows but I've used the newly
released Scriptware 1.0 for the Mac for a few weeks now and my
script is well into development.
</P>
<P>
   Like other scriptwriting programs, Scriptware will automatically
format, paginate, and allow easy scene shuffling and
reorganization. Although Scriptware comes with a manual, it's a
snap to get up and writing without ever referring to it because of
the program's intuitive commands.
</P>
<P>
   My few quibbles with Scriptware for the Mac are that it doesn't
include all the features in the Windows version, the typeface
defaults to a cheap-manual typewriter style, I couldn't import a
script produced on another scriptwriting program (even though the
manual said I could), and it has one of the most annoying
registration procedures known to mankind. Until you register the
program by phone _ which on the East Coast can only be done between
the hours of 11 a.m. and 7 p.m. _ a reminder message pops up on the
screen every few minutes preventing you from typing for at least 60
seconds. Since I'm never home between these hours, I still haven't
registered the product and the message is driving me nuts.
</P>
<P>
   But Scriptware is worth a look and you can download a demo at
the company's Web site at http://www.scriptware.com. While it
carries a suggested pricetag of $300, the program is currently on
sale for $200 and can be bought for about $100 as a competitive
upgrade if you already own another scriptwiting program.
</P>
<P>
   As good as Scriptware is, though, I give a slight edge to
another program called Final Draft, by B.C. Software, which just
released its latest version 4.1 for the Mac. Although its features
are nearly identical to Scriptware's, Final Draft seems more
aesthetically pleasing with a better look and feel, and the program
doesn't come with an annoying registration process.
</P>
<P>
   The company has posted regular, and free, updates to Final Draft
since its release and says that this fall it will produce Final
Draft A.V., which supports multicolumn scripts for audio-visual
scriptrwriters.
</P>
<P>
   The program also lists for $300 but can be found at some on-line
mail order companies for about $240. You can download a demo by
visiting http://www.finaldraft.com.
</P>
<P>
   Having a good scriptwriter program won't guarantee you can write
a good script, but the claims these programs make are essentially
true. Without them you could waste a lot of time organizing the
look of your script to conform to Hollywood's style.
</P>
<P>
   Freed from that drudgery, I'm able to concentrate solely on the
script itself. And I will, as soon as I find the time.

   Now this is networking.
</P>
<P>
   The online bookseller Amazon.com has enrolled the 100,000th Web
site for the Amazon.com Associates Program, a so-called affiliate
network that pays a commission of up to 15 percent for each sale
referred from a site. Members simply recommend titles at their
sites and establish links that enable direct purchases from
Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``It expands our presence to the far corners of the Web,'' said
Shawn Haynes, who runs the program for Amazon.com. The 100,000th
site, signed on Thursday, was the Miami-based Careernet.com, a
nationwide recruitment and job-posting service that will recommend
career-guidance books to visitors. Other recently enrolled,
high-profile associates include Intuit's Quicken.com, Compaq
Computer, and ABCnews.com.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com's affiliate network is up sharply from 30,000 just
last February, with much of the growth driven by the company's
expansion into music CD sales. That move has attracted die-hard
fans of every conceivable musical artist, affiliates who feed
traffic to Amazon.com from online shrines to Frank Sinatra or
Barenaked Ladies or David Cassidy or just about anyone else who has
ever put lips to microphone.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes said the two-year-old associates program generated a
significant minority of Amazon.com's total revenue, which topped
$100 million in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   One of Amazon.com's closest competitors in the online music
business, N2K Inc.'s Music Boulevard site, has renamed its
7,000-member Remote Access Music program, now simply calling it the
affiliate program. It, too, pays other Web sites commissions of up
to 15 percent for referred sales.

   A Way to Find Out What a Job Is Worth
</P>
<P>
   Dagwood Bumstead made a career of asking for a raise he never
seemed to get, but he might have had better luck had he been armed
with data from a new World Wide Web site, the Salary Zone
(http://www.ioma.com/zone).
</P>
<P>
   The site lets surfers, from clerks to chief executives,
determine their value in the marketplace by asking for comparable
salaries based on several factors: sex, region, management
responsibility, size of company and level of education.
</P>
<P>
   ``All over the world you can find out what you're worth in a way
that wasn't possible before,'' said Kathie Fitzgerald, the
Webmaster for the site, which is run by the Institute of Management
Administration, a business management publisher. The group surveys
professionals in a variety of fields twice a year and publishes 34
newsletters, like Shipping Manager's Report and Controlling Law
Firm Costs. ``A human resources professional would pay $199 a year
for a subscription to one of our publications,'' Ms. Fitzgerald
said. ``But if you're a job hunter, that would be ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, visitors to the site can pay $40 and wait 24 hours for
a verdict on their worth in the open marketplace. The institute's
parent company, the Bureau of National Affairs, based in
Washington, collects similar data on a wider group of professions,
and the two groups merged their data bases for this Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fitzgerald said there was a growing interest by individuals
in using the Web for career development. ``People looking for work
and people looking for talent are using the Internet more and
more,'' she said.

   One Expert's Buzz Is Another's Target
</P>
<P>
   There are two main paths to credibility in the world of
professional technology experts. One is to champion new trends,
making sweeping judgments and pronouncing ways in which the latest
technology could make all nonbelievers obsolete. This is called
preaching to the chat room.
</P>
<P>
   The other is to debunk new trends, poking holes in the
assumptions that others have made and throwing cold water on the
preachers. This is called being a calculated contrarian. Both
techniques seem to work when it comes to selling reports for
thousands of dollars. But the two strategies will go head to head
this week as two of the more prominent high-technology consulting
firms publicize reports on the convergence of voice and data
traffic in the nation's communications networks.
</P>
<P>
   In its report on the market for telephone calls that use
Internet technology, Abhi Chaki of Jupiter Communications calls the
consolidation of voice, video and data information onto unified
networks an ``inescapable reality.'' The firm says that will fuel
the adoption of Internet-style phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year or so, the views of people like Chaki have
taken on the patina of conventional wisdom. But what is really
inescapable after reading the report is the feeling that Jupiter,
based in New York, is congenitally friendly to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The calculated contrarian, Forrester Research, based in
Cambridge, Mass., is as intent on tearing down the concept of
network consolidation as Jupiter is in promoting it. In its latest
report, Forrester says that businesses will not bother with unified
voice-data networks and that multiple networks will live on.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we try to do is demystify hype,'' Maribel Lopez, the
Forrester analyst behind the report, said in an interview. ``The
buzz, a lot of it has to do with data guys looking to sell the next
router upgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the interest of demystification, it should be made clear
that Forrester made an early copy of the report available to a
reporter in an effort to create some buzz of its own.

<P>
   A New Watchdog Against Internet Fraud
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission is beefing up its
cyberpatrols with the creation of a new office to combat investment
fraud on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   John Reed Stark, an eight-year member of the SEC's enforcement
division, has been named to lead a new unit, the Office of Internet
Enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Stark, formerly the commission's special counsel for Internet
projects, said that creating the office would formalize efforts
that had already resulted in the prosecution of 30 cases. Those
have involved virtually every type of investment scam, including
phony offerings, market manipulations, frauds that aim at a
particular ethnic or religious group, and so-called pyramid and
Ponzi schemes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet access is ubiquitous and coming down in price,''
Stark said. ``Hardware is cheap. A lot of software is free, so it
is spreading across the planet. At the same time, we are
experiencing the greatest bull market in history. Put the two
together and you have more people gambling instead of investigating
their investments.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC already maintains a Web site
(http://www.sec.gov/enforce/comctr.htm) where people can lodge
complaints. Stark said he received about 120 complaints via e-mail
every day. ``They are the same scams that we've had over the last
65 years _ just on the Internet,'' he said.

PATENTS: MONEYMAKING MATH FORMULAS; CUTTING PAPER USE ON THE 
EXCHANGE FLOOR
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (Eds: In the formula in the 1st and last grafs of the 1st item, the
word EQUALS in parentheses should be replaced by an equals sign and
the 2 should be set as superscript.) 
 By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine that Albert Einstein were alive today and that he were
just now formulating his theory of relativity. Could he get a
patent on E(EQUALS)mc2?
</P>
<P>
   Some patent experts contend that Einstein might be able to,
thanks to a recent ruling by the federal U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The case in question _ State Street Bank and Trust Co. vs.
Signature Financial Group _ had nothing to do with physics. Rather,
at issue was a patent for a data-processing system for a so-called
hub-and-spoke mutual fund partnership in which mutual funds pool
their assets in an investment portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court's ruling has been long awaited by financial
services companies, which have resisted the idea that innovative
approaches in their industry should be patented. Visa and
Mastercard filed an amicus brief in the case saying they were doing
just fine without patents, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   But to no avail. The appeals court ruled on July 23 in favor of
Signature Financial, upholding its patent.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling, the court said, ``We hold the transformation of
data, representing discrete dollar amounts, by a machine through a
series of mathematical calculations into a final share price,
constitutes a practical application of a mathematical algorithm,
formula, or calculation, because it produces `a useful, concrete,
and tangible result.'''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: If your mathematical formula has a practical end,
you can probably patent it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this is going to cause a surge in patents relating
to financial instruments,'' said Peter Roberts, chief executive of
College Savings Bank of Princeton, N.J., who in 1988 received a
pioneering patent for a computerized prepaid tuition program.
</P>
<P>
   Some patent experts suggested that such an interpretation might
have allowed Michael Milken, for example, to have patented the idea
of junk bonds in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But the ruling may have even wider implications.
</P>
<P>
   E. Robert Yoches, a partner with the law firm of Finnegan,
Henderson, Farabow, Garrett &AMP; Dunner in Washington, said he thought
the appeals court had made the right decision in the case. But he
said the court had gone further than expected in its ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very broad, very sweeping,'' Yoches said. ``You can
probably get a patent on anything as long as it's not purely
mathematical _ as long as it produces a concrete, tangible
result.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling seems to bolster software patenting guidelines issued
three years ago by the Patent and Trademark Office, which expanded
the definition of what kinds of software are patentable.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Supreme Court ruled in this area was in 1981,
in the case of Diamond vs. Diehr. Then the court held that three
categories of matter are unpatentable: laws of nature, natural
phenomena and abstract ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the appeals court, which is the highest patent court
in the land short of the Supreme Court, has deviated from this
interpretation in a series of rulings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The direction the federal circuit has been moving is to say
you can patent anything as long as it's economically valuable,''
said Richard Stern, who teaches computer patent law at George
Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Amberg, a patent attorney in New York, said the appeals
court had gone too far with the State Street ruling. ``The federal
circuit has crossed over a critical line, and now holds eligible
for patent protection any computer-implemented math equation in
which the input are numbers and the output are numbers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus, if Einstein were alive and now uncovered the
E(EQUALS)mc2 law of nature, he could effectively monopolize its use
in the design of atomic reactors, bombs, et cetera,'' Amberg said.
``Because, for all practical purposes, a computer must be used to
perform the calculation of the amount of energy released.''
</P>
<P>
   Cutting Paper Use on the Exchange Floor
</P>
<P>
   Despite the advent of cell phones and headsets and special
electronic orders, most large buy and sell orders on the New York
Stock Exchange still involve paper transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Papyrus Technology Corp. in New York has patented a system using
hand-held devices that allow floor brokers to receive and execute
orders electronically.
</P>
<P>
   ``The floor broker enters information into the device as the
order is being filled,'' said L. Thomas Patterson Jr., one of the
inventors. ``This takes the paper out of the whole process.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange has developed its own hand-held electronic device,
which it recently introduced and which is being used by a small
number of brokers. Patterson declined to comment on whether he
thought the exchange's devices infringed his patent.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson, Desmond Sean O'Neill and Stephen Tyler Carroll
received patent 5,774,877, which is assigned to Papyrus Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

DIGITAL COMMERCE: INTERNET IS SNAGGING ON FREE-MARKET APPETITES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When does the term ``commercial Internet'' become an oxymoron?
Perhaps when powerful corporations use their market strength to
impose technical standards _ intended to further their own
interests and improve their bottom lines _ at the expense of
universal access to online goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   The browser war between Microsoft and Netscape Communications
already threatens a truly global marketplace that is fully
accessible with any browser on any computer platform. And this
threat is growing with the continuing push toward unilateral
standards that will dictate how consumers will one day interact,
for example, with online video programming or World Wide Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, this trend merely reflects companies' attempts to
differentiate their products _ an axiom of capitalism _ in the
chaotic Internet market. But in other cases, it stems from an
unrestrained appetite to control the flow of electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Such appetites ignore the fact that the reason the Internet
exists at all is that its technical protocols are open standards,
freely available for use by everyone. Standards were the reason for
its rapid adoption by the commercial world: The network itself
became exponentially more valuable as its popularity avalanched and
more companies and users tumbled to the benefits of being online.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet's ultimate seduction was that no matter what kind
of computer one used, its standardized protocols would smooth out
the rough spots and give the user as uniform and predictable an
online experience as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But the World Wide Web browser war that erupted in 1996, when
Microsoft launched the market equivalent of a thermonuclear attack
on Netscape's Navigator, brought that fairy tale to an abrupt end.
</P>
<P>
   Almost overnight, notices started appearing on various Web
sites, declaring that the sites had been ``optimized'' for one
browser or the other: ``Best viewed with Internet Explorer'' or
``Navigator required to display this page.''
</P>
<P>
   Such practices annoyed users, who until then could view
virtually everything that was on the Web no matter what computer or
browser they were using, and infuriated Web pioneers. They saw
browser battles as turf wars, the first step toward Balkanization
of the Internet _ a step that, if you believed the power of the
network to be collective by nature, would ultimately defeat the
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   More recently came the so-called portal, a thinly veiled
advertising strategy that purports to draw Web users into the
wonderful world of Disney, say, or Netscape or Yahoo, and keep them
there.
</P>
<P>
   But of course the trend for companies to establish their
proprietary identities atop the open Internet protocols did not
stop with software.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the ``optimized content'' initiative
sponsored by Intel. So blatant that it is almost endearing, the
initiative encourages Web developers to ``optimize'' Web sites so
they look noticeably better running on a Pentium II-based computer.
This means, conversely, that they look noticeably worse if you
happen not to own a Pentium II _ which is the precise situation
that Intel hopes to remedy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, none of these companies can really be expected to do
anything but mess around with the open standards of the Internet.
They are just following the laws of the free-market jungle.
</P>
<P>
   But an industry analyst notes that standards are also used as a
club by market leaders, thus stifling innovation.
</P>
<P>
   William Gurley, an analyst and venture capitalist with Hummer
Winblad Venture Partners in San Francisco, took on the issue of
standards in a recent article, saying that they actually run
counter to the interests of small, innovative companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Open is a euphemism for commodity,'' Gurley wrote. ``In
commodity markets, people differentiate with production or
distribution prowess and not with innovation.'' And the companies
with production and distribution prowess are generally the market
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   So, he says, although everyone believes that ``open'' is really
good for innovation _ especially in the Internet economy _ actually
``open'' is the most reliable way to preserve the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is today's hottest commodity, and an industry
announcement last week serves as a model for Gurley's point.
</P>
<P>
   The new Advanced Television Enhancement Forum, a coalition of
media and technology giants spearheaded by Intel, said it had
defined a modification to the standard Internet language, HTML,
that will govern the digital distribution, via the Internet, of
television programming with data added.
</P>
<P>
   And of course the specification also includes new computerized
products for consumers to buy, devices that are designed to display
the hybrid data.
</P>
<P>
   The group _ whose members include CNN, Disney, Microsoft, NBC,
Sony and Warner Bros. _ said that it intended to submit its new
rules to a variety of standards bodies, including W3C, the World
Wide Web Consortium, but that it would not await the group's
approval before promoting the standard to the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Gurley says it will be impossible for any start-up not to
support a standard from such a powerful series of market leaders.
If he is right, the Advanced TV Forum has, then, already trumped
any competing technical innovations that might be in the pipeline.
However, it also sloughs off vast numbers of existing Internet
users who may never have the proper equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Why would these entertainment and media companies make such a
huge investment in a tiny fraction of the Internet market _ which
is already a fraction of their existing markets for movies and
music _ in a genre where there continue to be no compelling
interactive applications or income?
</P>
<P>
   If differentiation is indeed the only way to succeed in
business, then it is clear that the Internet as it was designed _
global, two-way and largely accessible by anyone _ is going the way
of all flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the question remains: Is there some point at which
differentiation kills the goose that laid the golden egg?

CONGRESS WORKS TO RECONCILE 3 VERSIONS OF INTERNET TAX BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A proposed six-year moratorium on taxes in cyberspace would be
reduced to only two years under the version of the Internet Tax
Freedom Act approved by the Senate Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also voted last week to force states and local
governments that tax Internet access to end these taxes, but left
untouched claims for millions of dollars in taxes that America
Online did not collect from customers and may now have to pay at
its own expense.
</P>
<P>
   The Finance Committee's version of the bill differs
significantly from those passed by the House and by the Senate
Commerce Committee. The House version calls for a three-year
moratorium, while the Senate Commerce Committee's version would
keep the six-year moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   Both the House and the Senate Commerce Committee versions would
block states from citing the presence of computer servers to
establish a company's physical presence within a state. The Senate
Finance Committee's version is silent on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   Until most of these and other differences are worked out, the
bill is unlikely to reach the Senate floor for a vote. The Senate
is in recess until the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet Tax Freedom Coalition, the leading electronic
commerce group lobbying to make cyberspace free of taxes and
tariffs, contends that confusion about taxes is hampering the
growth of commerce in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   That argument was rejected by Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., and Sen.
Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., both members of the Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee, citing testimony by America Online that electronic
commerce will grow to $20 billion by 2000, said a two-year
moratorium was enough to determine how to tax cyberspace
transactions properly.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey dismissed the arguments of industry lobbyists that taxes
are crippling electronic commerce. ``This is no infant industry in
swaddling clothes,'' he said, citing 30 percent growth a month in
retail sales on the Internet. ``Wall Street can't throw money at
Internet companies fast enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The 19-1 vote by the Senate Finance Committee to approve its
version of the bill came on Tuesday, the same day that the Commerce
Department issued a report showing a growing disparity in access to
the Internet among various income groups. People making more than
$75,000 a year are seven times as likely to have access to the
Internet as those making $15,000 to $20,000 a year and more than
twice as likely as those making $35,000 to $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of making the Internet a tax-free zone was
criticized by Michael Maserov, a senior policy analyst with the
Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. ``This is just one more tax
break for the affluent at the expense of the poor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Finance Committee rejected, on a 10-10 vote, a
proposal by Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., that would have allowed
states that tax Internet access and data sold over the Internet to
continue those levies.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad, who was formerly his state's elected tax commissioner,
said he saw no compelling reason for the federal government to
interfere with state tax policies.
</P>
<P>
   The ``ability of states or local governments to collect tax'' on
transactions before July 29 would not be affected by the Senate
Finance Committee's version of the bill, according to committee
Chairman Sen. William Roth Jr., R-Del.
</P>
<P>
   That provision is a serious setback for America Online, the
nation's largest Internet service provider, which collects sales
taxes on behalf of foreign governments but has refused to collect
the same taxes when they are required by the states and local
governments.

THAT COCKTAIL DRESS IS A RED HERRING 
</HEADLINE>
  By TIMOTHY NOAH 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coverage of the Flytrap story has focused almost entirely on one
question: Did Bill Clinton have sex with Monica Lewinsky? Yet very
few Americans, and almost none of the journalists on the Flytrap
beat, have any doubts about the answer. So why has American
journalism concentrated on the least mysterious aspect of this
story?
</P>
<P>
   One explanation is that ``did they have sex'' is a question of
fact, whereas other Flytrap questions are matters of judgment or
policy or values. The social critic Dwight Macdonald wrote in his
great 1957 essay, ``The Triumph of the Fact'' (later reprinted in
his book Against the American Grain) that Americans are in love
with facts, ``valuing Facts in themselves, collecting them as boys
collect postage stamps, treating them, in short, as objects of
consumption rather than as productive tools.''
</P>
<P>
   Macdonald's point was that the obsessive accumulation of data
had become an unsatisfactory substitute for formulating notions
about what anything meant--an argument that seems even more
compelling since the advent of the Internet and all-news cable TV
channels. His best example of empiricism's limits was the
(apocryphal) story of how, at the dawn of the Enlightenment, a
scientist tried to establish the existence of the human soul ``not
by speculating on the Vital Principle and the Intrinsic Substance
of the Soul, as described in Aristotle and the Church Fathers, but
by weighing a condemned criminal before and after execution.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the U.S. press corps has spent the last half-year
examining whether adultery and perjury disqualify a man to be
president by chasing a cocktail dress allegedly stained with the
commander in chief's semen. This fact hunt, while somewhat insane,
is also perfectly understandable--and even laudable--in the context
of what's broadly understood to be the press's mandate to gather
information with rigorous impartiality. As press critics never tire
of saying, the mainstream press's job isn't, or shouldn't be, to
jump to conclusions--even in instances such as Flytrap, where
Hypothesis and Conclusion seem separated by a very short
evidentiary hop.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that some Flytrap allegations were poorly sourced and
that two respected news organizations, the Wall Street Journal and
the Dallas Morning News, had to retract a couple of particularly
lurid stories. Media critics such as Pete Hamill and Steven Brill
have lacerated the press for getting the facts wrong. But now that
Flytrap is entering what looks like its penultimate stage, all this
high-minded outrage is starting to look a bit quaint. Lewinsky is
expected to tell a grand jury that she did indeed have sex with
Clinton and that Clinton encouraged her to lie about the
relationship in an affidavit submitted to Paula Jones' lawyers. And
Clinton has agreed to answer grand jury questions via
closed-circuit TV.
</P>
<P>
   The president, of course, is one of those few people who still
claim there is a factual issue at stake. Before the grand jury, he
may admit to having had sex with Lewinsky, thereby admitting to
having committed perjury in the Jones suit. (The general view is
that perjury in civil suits isn't easy to prosecute, especially if
the suit has been dismissed, as Jones' was.) Or Clinton could stick
to his story and perjure himself before the grand jury (a much more
serious crime). Or Clinton might stick to his story because it's
true. But this scenario--never plausible--is even more unlikely now
that prosecutors have what the New York Post dubbed the Love Dress.
</P>
<P>
   This dress is what Alfred Hitchcock used to call the
McGuffin--the all-important object whose pursuit frames a narrative
(examples: the Maltese falcon, Charles Foster Kane's sled, and the
uranium-packed wine bottles in Hitchcock's own ``Notorious''). The
Love Dress's existence was first speculated upon in the Drudge
Report (where it was black) and then on ABC (where it was navy
blue).
</P>
<P>
   United Press International, passing along the ABC report,
asserted Lewinsky had saved a semen-stained dress; in fact, ABC's
Jackie Judd had reported only that Lewinsky said she'd saved such a
dress. Then a few news organizations got the stained dress confused
with another dress that Lewinsky allegedly had received from
Clinton. This other dress was a ``multicolored peasant dress''
(according to the New York Post), purchased for not much money on
Martha's Vineyard (Time), that might not exist at all (according to
Newsweek Washington bureau chief Ann McDaniel) or really be a long
T-shirt (William Ginsburg to Barbara Walters on ABC's ``20/20'').
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the FBI reportedly was going through Lewinsky's
closets at the Watergate, testing every dress in sight and finding
no stains. It turns out (if the latest reports are accurate) the
dress had been in hiding with Lewinsky's Manhattanite mother,
Marcia, who turned it over last week to prosecutors in exchange for
immunity. An FBI spokeswoman quoted in the New York Times said the
agency will first establish whether there is any semen on the dress
(easy to do) and then spend ``several weeks'' finding out whose
semen it is (somewhat more difficult but, since the mid-1990s, not
all that hard, according to the Washington Post).
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the genetic markers point to Clinton (and that Clinton
doesn't resort to claiming a heretofore undisclosed identical
twin), scientific empiricism, in collaboration with the more untidy
empiricism of daily journalism, will have triumphed.
</P>
<P>
   But please permit an unscientific generalization: There is not a
reporter in Washington who seriously doubts, amid this furious DNA
hunt, that President Clinton had a sexual encounter with Lewinsky.
Indeed, it would likely be hard to find even a White House aide
who, in the privacy of his/her home, would tell a spouse that
he/she buys Clinton's story. Whenever a Paul Begala or a Mike
McCurry asserts in public that he truly believes Clinton, it's
treated by the press as news, because the common assumption is that
Clinton officials believe their boss is lying. And when they say
they believe Clinton is telling the truth, every reporter quoting
them assumes they're lying, too.
</P>
<P>
   The only new fact in Flytrap that would qualify as genuine news
would be one proving Bill Clinton didn't have sex with Lewinsky.
The important question is not whether Clinton had sex with her and
lied about it but what the country should do about this.
</P>
<P>
   In dealing with the real issue, the American press is hobbled by
its strengths as well as its weaknesses. Like Macdonald's
fictitious scientist, it is uncomfortable with abstractions.
Flytrap is a case of journalists doing precisely what press critics
are always hectoring them to do--just supply the facts, don't
indulge in opinion or conclusion--and shows the inadequacy of that
journalistic ideal. Some might say the inadequacies of the Flytrap
coverage are a point in favor of the British system, in which
journalists are freer to reveal their opinions. (The American
convention is not quite what it seems: American journalists are
permitted to act on their prejudices--the news columns and air time
devoted to Flytrap wouldn't make sense unless reporters and editors
believed the accusations. They're just not permitted to express
this belief.) At the very least, Flytrap illustrates the need for
less fact chasing and more analysis and illumination of the ``what
should we do about it'' question.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe the moral is simply the need for more humility about
how useful journalism is in addressing matters of public
importance. Fifteen years ago, Sidney Blumenthal, now a top adviser
to President Clinton, wrote an incisive piece for the New Republic
examining why then-President Ronald Reagan's frequent factual
misstatements hadn't made him as unpopular as Richard Nixon or
Jimmy Carter. The answer was that the reporters who assailed
Reagan's howlers were empiricists, but Reagan himself was not. He
was animated not by Fact but by Belief. (Reagan unconsciously
seconded this judgment at the 1988 Republican convention when,
botching a quote from John Adams, he declared, ``Facts are stupid
things.'')
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal's boss has very little in common with Reagan and, if
anything, wears his beliefs too lightly. But somewhere along the
way, he may have absorbed Reagan's lesson that while Americans like
to gather Facts, the power Facts have to settle important questions
is vastly overrated.

BEAR CALL 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES SUROWIECKI 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   How did that old Reagan for President television ad go?
Something like: ``Some people say the bear doesn't exist. . . . But
what if there is a bear?''
</P>
<P>
   The ad was surely better-phrased than that, but it certainly did
come to mind Tuesday as the stock market continued its downward
slide, with the Dow tumbling nearly 300 points and the Nasdaq 65
points, or almost 5 percent. Coming on top of two straight days of
selling and two weeks of incredible volatility, today's sell-off
(which included a dramatic 150-point drop in the last 20 minutes of
trading) seems to have given even the most bullish strategists
second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the bulls scurry for cover has certainly been the most
entertaining part of the past couple of days. (Actually, it's been
the only entertaining part. Even if you think that stocks are
incredibly overvalued, there's something troubling about watching
them fall so far, so fast.) Ralph Acampora of Prudential
Securities, one of the perma-bulls, went on CNBC yesterday and
predicted that the Dow would break 10,000 by year-end, only to
change his mind in the next 12 hours. This morning, Acampora sent a
note to clients suggesting that the Dow could be in for a major
correction, and late this afternoon again went on CNBC and made
what he described as ``a bear call.'' Acampora, who specializes in
that brand of pseudo-science called technical analysis, hedged his
bets, of course, saying that if the Dow ended the day below a
certain point, then it would accelerate lower, while if it didn't,
then it could rally to 10,000. But his call was definitive enough
to spook investors who have been counting on utopian buying to make
up for the exceedingly mediocre performance of corporate earnings
in the last two quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Acampora was very good-natured about everything, and
seemed troubled by the amount of short-term authority that he is
apparently able to wield. But listening to his explanation of why
he had suddenly become bearish, it was hard not to think, ``What's
different here?'' All the factors he cited have been true of the
market for weeks now, and saying that the Dow is going to sell off
because the Dow is selling off doesn't really count as much of a
prophecy.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, the barrage of technical reasons for the
sell-off we were offered today are essentially irrelevant to the
underlying fundamentals that seem at last to be driving this market
downward: the Asian crisis, declining corporate earnings and profit
margins, and slowing growth. And while investors have become
accustomed to buying on the dips, the truth is that the prices of
even already beaten-down stocks are still so high that it's hard to
see them as bargains. In some cases, stocks whose value has been
cut in half are still trading at P/E ratios two or three times the
market's historical average. And undeniably great companies, like
Cisco Systems and Coca-Cola, are trading at prices so high above
their annual growth rates that describing them as cheap in any
sense seems preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows where the market will be heading in the next couple of
weeks? But for too long now bulls have been operating under the
delusion that liquidity was necessarily going to drive this market
higher. There was just too much money in the market for stocks to
drop, we were told. But of course money that flows into the stock
market can just as easily flow out of it, and nothing will
encourage that outward flow like declining equity prices. In the
long run, stock prices will mirror corporate earnings and the
broader interest-rate environment. Interest rates are about where
they've been for the past 3&AMP;frac12; years, but corporate earnings
are now significantly worse than they have been over that period.
It won't be any surprise if stock prices end up significantly worse
as well.

   If you haven't seen it yet, this week's Time magazine's cover
features an arresting picture of Madcap Monica in full groupie
ecstasy. Her lips gleam scarlet-woman red as she gleefully embraces
the Big He at a 1996 fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Since this photograph is far more suggestive than the ``God do I
have to see it again'' TV tape of Monica in her DKNY beret in
another presidential embrace, Chatterbox was curious how this new
picture managed to stay under wraps for six months in the midst of
the breathless Washington media frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery was unraveled by one phone call to Dirck Halstead,
the Time photographer who has saved us from ever seeing that bloody
beret again. Back in February, Halstead had an inkling that
sometime, somewhere ``I knew I had photographed that face with
Clinton.'' As Halstead, a veteran White House photographer, put it,
``We remember things in terms of the photographs we shoot. Your
mind creates folders.''
</P>
<P>
   After sorting through maybe 5,000 Clinton out-takes, he hit pay
dirt. ``It was an extraordinarily lucky moment,'' Halstead
recalled. ``If I had posed and lit the whole scene, I couldn't have
done it any better.''
</P>
<P>
   When Halstead sent the photo to Time, the magazine did something
unprecedented in the current scandalrama--it kept a juicy secret
for five months. ``We decided that we'd wait until the story came
back,'' Halstead said.
</P>
<P>
   The picture was snapped during an Oct. 23, 1996, fund-raiser at
the Washington Sheraton. With that date in hand, your dogged
investigative reporter raced to the White House archives to
discover what Clinton said on that memorable occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Now it can be told: On taking the microphone, the president said
in words that I'm certain Monica thought only referred to her, ``I
was tired when I walked in, but I'm not tired any more. You've
given me a lot of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the speech, in a passage that also could have
double-edged meaning, Clinton exuberantly told the crowd of adoring
young voters, ``You'll have more opportunities to live out your
dreams, to imagine things and then make them happen in your lives
than any generation of people in all of human history.''
</P>
<P>
   Wait, it gets better. The president then mused, ``But it will
only happen if you can preserve some of the old-fashioned virtues
that have gotten us here after 220 years.'' Chatterbox wonders
precisely which ``old-fashioned virtues'' were weighing so heavily
on the president's mind.
</P>
<P>
   (Unless you work for Steve Brill, readers can skip the
obligatory full-disclosure announcement that Chatterbox knows
Halstead from our days together at Time, a magazine that Chatterbox
still writes for occasionally.)

REVERSE DISCRIMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM SALETAN 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas addressed the
National Bar Association, an organization of black lawyers. Thomas
had been unofficially disinvited by some of his critics--the third
time they have disrupted one of his planned appearances--and some
lawyers walked out during his speech. Afterward, his detractors
packed a forum to castigate him and his opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Black writers and thinkers continue to buzz about the
confrontation. Many pundits deem Thomas the victor. The Chicago
Tribune says he ``strongly defended his conservative views, his
right to think for himself, and his objection to having his views
defined by any racial party line.'' The Washington Post says that
``one can only cheer him on. ... (He) has no duty to parrot the
orthodoxies of affirmative action simply because he is black.''
Post columnist William Raspberry writes, ``Thomas has managed
(again) to wrest the intellectual, ethical and common-sense high
ground from his critics.''
</P>
<P>
   How did Thomas defeat those who accuse him of tolerating subtle
racial discrimination? By accusing them of subtle racial
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' enemies had a transparent game plan going into the NBA
convention: to contrast him with the late Thurgood Marshall, the
only other black Supreme Court justice. The forum at which they
denounced Thomas' views was titled ``The Supreme Court and Civil
Rights: The Marshall Years and the Thomas Years.'' At the forum,
Thomas' foremost critic, Judge Leon Higginbotham, who is now a
Harvard professor, said contemptuously of Thomas, ``The difference
between him and Justice Marshall ... is the difference between zero
and infinity.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas thwarted these critics by changing the context. He
contrasted himself not with Marshall but with the white justices
who currently serve alongside Thomas. ``I, for one, have been
singled out for particularly bilious and venomous assaults,'' he
said. ``These criticisms ... have little to do with any particular
opinion. ... Rather, the principal problem seems to be a deeper
antecedent offense. I have no right to think the way I do because
I'm black. Though the ideas and opinions themselves are not
necessarily illegitimate if held by non-black individuals, they,
and the person enunciating them, are illegitimate if that person
happens to be black. Thus, there's a subset of criticism that must
of necessity be reserved for me, even if every non-black member of
the court agrees with the idea or the opinion. You see, they are
exempt from this kind of criticism, precisely because they are not
black.''
</P>
<P>
   At the forum that followed his speech, Thomas' detractors
accused him of playing the race card. They're right, and it's
hardly the first time he's done so. At the climax of his 1991
confirmation hearing, he knocked the political wind out of his
hostile Senate interrogators by appearing before them on national
television and calling the hearing ``a high-tech lynching for
uppity blacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing Thomas' NBA speech, the New York Times observed, ``His
instinct to turn antagonism toward his ideas into a racial matter
is an odd impulse for a man who wants to be judged on his intellect
and ideas alone.''
</P>
<P>
   But, his critics were clearly on the defensive _ and in a way
that conceded his main point. ``The problem is not that Thomas is
black,'' scoffed New York University law Professor Michael
Higginbotham. ``The problem with Thomas is what he says.'' Columbia
University law Professor Kimberle Crenshaw added, ``Clarence Thomas
is telling us that we need to relinquish the race consciousness,
the vision of racial solidarity, that we've used up to this point.
And in this narrow sense, I agree with him. The issue is not
whether or not he's a brother. ... The issue is whether or not the
politics and policies he represents are in our best interests.''
</P>
<P>
   By rejecting his racial analysis and insisting they were
criticizing his jurisprudence on its merits, Thomas' challengers
were forced to invoke, for a convenient moment, his policy of
presumptive colorblindness. Perhaps, as Crenshaw suggested, they
can debunk Thomas' judicial philosophy without resorting to
``race-consciousness'' and ``racial solidarity.'' If so, they will
have won the battle but lost the war.

IBM TO ANNOUNCE AN ADVANCE IN CHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   IBM plans to announce on Monday that it has perfected a
significant new manufacturing process to produce semiconductor
chips that can achieve either higher speed or significantly lower
power consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Known as silicon-on-insulator, or SOI, technology, the new
technique is the third major advance in semiconductors that IBM has
announced in the last year. The company's top research executives
said that the latest advance should give IBM a lead of one to two
years in a highly competitive industry.
</P>
<P>
   In September, IBM reported that it would begin using copper to
connect transistors on its chips, advancing speed. And in June it
said it would start making silicon germanium chips, which are
expected to have a broad market soon in portable and wireless
consumer devices.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid-fire string of advances illustrates a major shift in
the origins of new technologies and the directions they follow as
they are adopted by the computer industry. Until the 1990s, new
technologies tended to trickle down from advanced military and
high-end corporate applications. But increasingly, the most
powerful innovations are deployed almost immediately to the vast
market for low-cost consumer electronics.
</P>
<P>
   IBM officials said that the realization of SOI technology
vindicated a persistent investment in a technology that for three
decades had been considered out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important strategic advantage for IBM,'' said
Richard Doherty, an electrical engineer who worked on efforts to
develop the technology at Data General in the 1970s and who is now
president of Envisioneering Inc., a computer and consumer
electronics consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   IBM engineers have found a way to embed an ultrathin layer of
insulating material just under the surface of a silicon wafer. The
insulating layer sharply reduces the amount of electronic charge a
transistor must store each time it is turned on.
</P>
<P>
   That will make it possible for IBM to increase the speed of its
chips by as much as 35 percent beginning in the first half of next
year. That is equal to the increase in performance typically
achieved in an entire generation of chips. The company said it also
planned to apply the process in the second half of 1999 to achieve
a significant reduction in the power requirements of chips for
portable applications.
</P>
<P>
   IBM executives estimated that the new process would initially
add about 10 percent to the costs of its chip-making process, but
they predicted that this could eventually be cut in half.
</P>
<P>
   The IBM process uses a machine called an ion implanter to push
oxygen molecules at great speeds so they come to rest beneath the
surface of a silicon wafer.
</P>
<P>
   The secret to the breakthrough, however, turned out to lie in an
annealing, or heating, process developed by IBM engineers. By
heating the wafers in a particular way after the oxide layer was
deposited, the engineers were able to form an almost perfect
silicon layer on the surface of the wafer. This silicon layer, only
400 or 500 atoms thick, is the key to transistors that can switch
electrical current on and off more quickly or can consume far less
energy in battery-powered devices.
</P>
<P>
   One significant consequence of the latest advance is that it
will help IBM's engineers protect chip circuitry from the troubling
effect of natural background radiation, which becomes an increasing
problem as the size of transistors shrinks with each new generation
of chips.
</P>
<P>
   Background radiation can corrupt data stored in memory chips,
producing what semiconductor engineers call soft errors. As the
chip industry moves toward line widths as fine as 0.18 microns _
about one five-hundredths of the width of a human hair _ soft
errors in data are a growing concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of major chip makers have simply given up on the
technology,'' said Bryan Lewis, a semiconductor analyst at
Dataquest, a market research firm based in San Jose, Calif. ``But
this will have a dramatic impact on the industry. In 10 years it
will have taken over half of the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone believes that the technology will give IBM a lead
that proves impossible to match, however. An Intel Corp.
semiconductor researcher said that Intel had evaluated the
technology in the past and decided that it would be a safer
strategy to press ahead with pure silicon.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he acknowledged that in low-power applications, IBM's
process could provide a real advantage.

THE PEOPLE BEHIND APPLE'S `THINK DIFFERENT' CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A computer marketer wants to become the apple of your eye by
advertising itself as the Apple of your icon.
</P>
<P>
   For almost a year, Apple Computer Inc. has been displaying
images of some of the world's most-admired achievers in fields from
government and business to human rights and the arts as the
centerpiece of a campaign that ungrammatically urges consumers to
``Think different.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the campaign is to further polish the once-tarnished
Apple brand name, asserting that the company nurtures creativity by
behaving as unconventionally as the accomplished thinkers and doers
who are praised as ``the round pegs in the square holes'' in
television commercials, print ads, billboards, posters and wall
signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ads are for people who don't care what the computer
does,'' said Allen Olivo, senior director for worldwide marketing
communications at Apple in Cupertino, Calif., ``but care about what
they can do with the computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The premise is that people who use Apple computers are
different,'' he said, ``and that we make computers for those
creative people who believe that one person can change the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The celebrated strivers who make it through a nomination and
selection process at Apple and its advertising agency, the TBWA
Chiat/Day unit of TBWA Worldwide in Venice, Calif., are portrayed
in the ads as larger-than-life icons in striking black-and-white
photographs. They are presented as the kind of heroes who, a
commercial proclaims, ``push the human race forward,'' a phrase
that subtly flatters the intended audience for recognizing the
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign has so far featured more than 40 so-called crazy
ones: historic and contemporary figures who include Bob Dylan,
Einstein, Ted Turner, Picasso, John Lennon and Yoko Ono, Edison,
Muhammad Ali, Alfred Hitchcock, Miles Davis, Lucille Ball and Desi
Arnaz, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Amelia Earhart, Jim Henson,
Rosa Parks, Frank Lloyd Wright and Jerry Seinfeld. And more are on
the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to say these people use Apple,'' said Lee
Clow, the chief creative officer at TBWA Worldwide, owned by
Omnicom Group, ``or that if they could've used a computer, they
would've used Apple. Instead, we're going for the emotional
celebration of creativity, which should always be part of how we
speak about the brand.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it was overreaching to involve Einstein, Gandhi and
Picasso in pitching, Olivo replied: ``We would never associate
these people with any product; it's Apple celebrating them versus
Apple using them. To say that Albert Einstein would have used a
computer would cross the line. Why would he need one? But it's
different to say he looked at the world differently.''
</P>
<P>
   That makes the Apple advertising a kind of commercialized,
updated version of songs like ``They All Laughed'' and ``You're the
Top,'' which paid tribute to such men and women of distinction as
Marconi, Garbo, Ford, O'Neill, Astaire and the Wright brothers. At
least two figures mentioned in those songs _ Edison and Gandhi _
have turned up in the Apple campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And of course there is a lengthy list of campaigns that feature
constellations of stars rather than single celebrities, from the
``Dewar's Profiles'' for Dewar's Scotch whisky to the khaki-clad
notables for Gap Inc. to the ``milk mustache'' ads created for the
National Fluid Milk Processor Promotion Board.
</P>
<P>
   Critics often complain that celebrities appearing in ads are
``selling out.'' Olivo said Apple and TBWA Chiat/Day ``haven't
really heard that,'' even about performers in the campaign like
Dylan and Joan Baez, ``perhaps because we don't use their work as
much as show them working.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads have already won several industry awards; the first
television commercial in the campaign has been nominated for an
Emmy. The ads have also inspired parodies. The ABC and CBS
television networks ran promotional spots spoofing the campaign,
while pranksters have posted ``Think different'' lampoons with
Charles Manson and Genghis Khan on Web sites.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
NYT-08-02-98 1848EDT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And there are games based on the campaign. One is to guess who
may next be featured in an ad; how about Steven Spielberg? Ray
Charles? Bill Gates? Another is to play ``Whozzat?'' with friends
and co-workers, asking them to identify some of the less familiar
faces like the dancer Martha Graham, the singer Maria Callas, the
photographer Ansel Adams, the architect Frank Gehry, and the
advertising executives Bill Bernbach and Mary Wells Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   The genesis of the campaign was the crisis facing Apple last
year when Steven Jobs returned to run the company, which was
confronting huge problems that included plunging market share,
declining stock value and sagging employee morale. It was a year
ago Monday that Jobs decided to seek help by reuniting with Clow.
Jobs and Clow _ whose birthday is coincidentally Aug. 3 _
collaborated on Apple ads like the famous ``1984'' commercial when
Jobs originally ran Apple and Clow was the top creative executive
at the old Chiat/Day agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked us to come in and talk about what Apple needed to
do to get its focus back,'' Clow said. ``It really wasn't hard; it
was just to go back to Apple's roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our thought was that Apple was not the computer on every
desk,'' he said, ``but the computer loved by most creative
communities like graphic designers, Web sites designers, film
makers, advertising agencies, because it doesn't get in the way of
the creativity. The analogy we made was to Harley-Davidson
motorcycles, which have been successful by being a unique product
for a unique audience.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, the agency wanted to show ``people currently using
Apple technology to articulate the `Think different' concept,''
Clow said, such as animators at Dreamworks SKG, ``but that didn't
seem quite a big enough statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Then one weekend, he added, ``we walked into a room and saw
`Think different' attached to Gandhi and Martin Luther King and
Einstein,'' paying tribute ``to creativity and genius by saluting
the kind of people who think and change things.'' Among those
involved in that ``Eureka!'' moment were Rob Siltanen, creative
director; Jessica Schulman, art director, and Craig Tanimoto,
copywriter.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign was swiftly approved by Apple, then begun with the
television commercial, which first ran on Sept. 28, followed by the
print ads, billboards and posters.
</P>
<P>
   It was always the intention to run the photos without
identifications, Clow said, citing a similar strategy pursued by
Chiat/Day for Nike Inc. during the 1984 Summer Olympics with wall
posters of athletes like Joan Benoit and Mary Decker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes more involving and challenging to figure something
out,'' he explained, ``like solving a puzzle. Young people like it
because they feel they're not being talked down to. And the
knowledgeable people feel it's cool to be among the cognoscenti.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Olivo said, ``I can't tell you how many advertising
people called when the Wells ads ran to say, `I know I'm supposed
to know, but who's the woman?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, TBWA Chiat/Day executives have sifted through
hundreds of suggestions, via letters and e-mail, for potential
enlistees for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs has been involved from the beginning, Clow said,
contributing ``people who thrill him like Buckminster Fuller'' and
helping secure photographs from sources like Ms. Ono.
</P>
<P>
   The one setback so far for the campaign has been a spate of
negative publicity generated by a decision not to run ads with the
Dalai Lama in Hong Kong to placate the Chinese Communists who
opposed him. (The ads continued in other countries.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Most companies probably wouldn't have gone near him in the
first place,'' Clow said.
</P>
<P>
   Determining who will appear in the campaign involves
negotiations with representatives of people who are living, and
sometimes the people themselves. With the dead, rights are obtained
from ``close family members, estates, lawyers,'' Clow said. ``Some
are harder, some are easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, he added, it is a question of ``getting the right
image of some people who are not here to photograph anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   As for payment, Olivo said, ``everyone has received
compensation, but not one has accepted money for personal gain.''
He and Clow said they were all given money and/or computer
equipment, which have been donated to schools, foundations,
charities and nonprofit organizations. They declined to discuss the
specific amounts.
</P>
<P>
   Olivo credited the campaign with a major role in the recent
improvement in Apple's fortunes. Though the company is still
struggling, Apple has surprised the naysayers by exceeding earnings
estimates from Wall Street for three consecutive quarters, selling
record numbers of G3 Macintosh computers, raising its stock price
and reducing employee turnover.
</P>
<P>
   ``It accomplished everything we wanted to in spades,'' Clow said
proudly, ``and so much more than we'd hoped.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a long wish list of personalities for future ads, said
Clow, citing the Beatles, Orson Welles, Jackie Robinson, Cesar
Chavez, John Glenn ``before he goes back into space'' and Charlie
Chaplin, which would also tweak an Apple rival because an actor
portraying Chaplin as the Little Tramp was once the focus of ads
for IBM.
</P>
<P>
   He said one of the biggest disappointments in the campaign was
the failure to get the wife and son of Jacques Cousteau to agree to
allow use of his photograph.
</P>
<P>
   On Olivo's wish list are Elvis Presley, Dag Hammarskjold, Jimi
Hendrix, ``maybe Nelson Mandela'' and perhaps Howard Cosell, who,
Olivo said, ``changed sportscasting _ but is that a heroic
enterprise?''
</P>
<P>
   Both want to include additional celebrities from Australia,
Japan and other countries outside North America.
</P>
<P>
   And on one issue, both think alike: They agree with a decision
by Jobs not to be the subject of an ad.

NBC BACKING AN ONLINE TV SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif. _ NBC will invest in and supply programming
to a startup online service to provide movies, television programs
and music on demand to personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement could mean that viewers who miss ``Dateline'' at
night could see it the next day at times of their choosing, said
Jonathan Taplin, co-chairman of Intertainer Inc., the start-up
company.
</P>
<P>
   But by making programs available online, NBC risks angering its
affiliated local stations at a time when it is trying to reorganize
its relationship with them.
</P>
<P>
   The affiliates ``have a very legitimate interest in a certain
level of exclusivity,'' said Martin Yudkovitz, president of NBC
Interactive Media. While news programs might be available online
soon after they are broadcast, Intertainer will get entertainment
shows only from previous seasons, he said. Also, only programs
owned by NBC itself, like ``Saturday Night Live'' and ``The Tonight
Show,'' will be eligible for the online service, not shows like
``ER'' that are broadcast by NBC but owned by others.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, NBC and GE Capital, both owned by General
Electric Co., will together invest about $3 million for a 6 percent
stake in privately held Intertainer. They will have options to buy
up to 19 percent at a price of about $75 million in the next 18
months, Taplin said. NBC would not confirm those figures.
</P>
<P>
   NBC affiliates might not have much to worry about. Previous
attempts to provide video on demand, like Time Warner's 500-channel
cable system in Orlando, Fla., have failed.
</P>
<P>
   And NBC's investment in Intertainer does not represent a big
bet. NBC has made small investments in numerous Internet and
interactive television companies, in hopes of being well positioned
for the future. It offers short video clips on Videoseeker, a Web
site it runs.
</P>
<P>
   Intertainer is run by Taplin and Richard Baskin, both long
experienced in Hollywood. In addition to NBC, its investors include
Comcast, a cable television operator, and Intel, Sony and US West.
Its service will be offered next month in Willow Grove, Pa., to
Comcast cable customers who order cable modems and later this year
in Denver by US West over so-called digital-subscriber telephone
lines.

DEAL TO CREATE THE LARGEST INTERACTIVE AD AGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a combination that will create the largest agency devoted to
creating advertising on the Internet, Agency.com has agreed to buy
Eagle River Interactive.
</P>
<P>
   This deal, which is expected to be announced Monday, is the
latest in a mad game of Pac Man, in which the dozens of small
agencies founded by young entrepreneurs are racing to gobble one
another up.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes in many of these transactions is Omnicom
Group, the huge advertising agency holding company, which has taken
stakes in several of the most prominent start-up interactive
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Omnicom owns 40 percent of Agency.com, which is based in New
York, and all of Eagle River Interactive, based in Chicago. The
terms of the deal have not been disclosed, but Omnicom's stake in
Agency.com will increase to just under half as a result of the
deal, said Chan Suh, Agency.com's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Agency.com has also bought Online Magic,
Spiral Media, Ketchum Interactive and Interactive Solutions. The
last two were also owned by Omnicom.
</P>
<P>
   Interactive agencies provide a range of services, including
helping companies set up their own sites on the World Wide Web and
placing ``banner'' advertisements on other sites to bring in
traffic. While this business incorporates the sort of writing and
design skills used by conventional advertising agencies, much of
the work of the interactive shops more closely resembles the
detailed computer programming typically provided by technology
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``An interactive company is one part creativity, one part
technology and one part business strategy,'' said Felice Kincannon,
who looks after Omnicom's interactive holdings through a unit
called Communicade.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, technology companies have been expanding into this
field. Both IBM and Electronic Data Services Corp. have set up big
interactive design departments as an adjunct to their business of
building elaborate Internet sites for companies.
</P>
<P>
   And two of the most aggressive acquirers of interactive agencies
_ U S Web in Santa Clara, Calif., and iXL in Atlanta _ have been
buying both technology and design companies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the conventional advertising companies have the greatest
ties to the existing interactive agencies, with True North
Communications, Grey Advertising and Interpublic Group all owning
stakes in at least one of the top 15 agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Omnicom, however, has been the most aggressive, with stakes in
four of the top 15 ranked by Adweek magazine, including Agency.com,
now tied with iXL for first place; Think New Ideas, the
fifth-ranked agency; Organic Online, No. 7, and Eagle River, No.
14. In total, its six agencies have 1,500 employees and revenues of
$180 million. That represents about one-third of what Jupiter
Communications estimates is a $500 million market this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of picking one horse to ride, Omnicom has spread its
bets and has watched how the race turned out,'' said Seth Alpert, a
senior adviser to Ad Media Partners, a New York investment bank
that specializes in media companies. ``So far, they have done a
pretty good job.
</P>
<P>
   As it has with conventional advertising agencies, Omnicom has
been able to buy into the younger interactive agencies by offering
to act as the friendly, but unintrusive, big brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not backseat drivers,'' Suh said, adding that
Agency.com had few client referrals from other Omnicom agencies.
But it has been able to ask executives of the holding company
questions from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like having your own consulting company on call,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Omnicom has subtly encouraged the strongest of its flock to
absorb the laggards. In February it flew the top executives of all
of its interactive companies to a retreat in Miami. While Omnicom
did not play explicit matchmaker, the flirtation was as heavy as on
a college spring break.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a courting thing,'' said Kevin Rowe, the chief
executive of Eagle River. After a first date of a joint project for
Compaq Computer, Eagle River and Agency.com decided to get hitched.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the combination, Agency.com, which was founded in
1995, will have 575 employees in 10 offices and 1998 revenues of
about $80 million. Agency.com's largest clients include British
Airways, GTE and Metropolitan Life. Eagle River, a descendant of a
company that placed billboards on Colorado ski slopes, serves
clients that include Sprint and Disneyland Paris.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many advertising-industry executives believe Agency.com is
trying to grow quickly in preparation for an initial public
offering. Suh declined to comment on any potential offering.
</P>
<P>
   Others wonder whether many of these young companies are
expanding faster than they can handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get worried for a company like Agency.com,'' said Gene
DeRose, the president of Jupiter Communications. ``I think they
have to be careful about how they integrate their acquisitions.''
</P>
<P>
   DeRose pointed to the example of CKS Group, one of the first
publicly held interactive agencies, which has found melding its
many acquisitions harder than it expected. CKS' stock trades at
less than half of its 52-week high of $64.25, reached last
September; the shares closed at $19.3125 Friday, off 12.5 cents, in
Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   Others point out that the acquisition price for interactive
agencies is vastly higher than for conventional ad agencies, which
typically are sold for about the total of their annual revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The high water mark for pricing was recently set by ICC
Technologies, a Hatboro, Pa., maker of humidity-control systems,
which recently moved onto the Internet by buying Rare Medium, a
small New York agency, for $45 million, more than 11 times its
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Many other more traditional buyers are turning up their noses at
those prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recently met with a foreign agency who said they were
looking for an interactive shop in this country,'' Alpert of Ad
Media Partners said. ``We told them they would have to pay four or
five times revenue, and they were aghast and went home.''

BRINGING CHINA ON LINE, WITH OFFICIAL BLESSINGS
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Peter Yip is not shy about his ambitions. As he
steers a visitor through the bustling offices of the China Internet
Corp. here, Yip describes how his company will be a catalyst for
bringing the Internet to China and its 1.2 billion people.
</P>
<P>
   Employees are busy collecting news dispatches from Reuters and
Bloomberg, which they send to Beijing to be translated into
Chinese. Later, China Internet will post the material on its
service, where anyone in China with a computer and the $30-a-month
subscription fee can log on to a world of Western news.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese government recognizes that the Internet is a
global thing,'' said Yip, 43, the vice chairman of the company,
which is based in Hong Kong and backed by the official New China
News Agency _ not to mention an impressive array of American
technology companies. ``That's why they've established a strategy
and asked me to help them create a vehicle to allow people to
participate.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that kind of pronouncement that makes Yip's rivals seethe.
They say China Internet, known as CIC, is only one of dozens of
companies throughout the country that are racing to put China on
line. In China, as in the United States, the Internet seems to be
growing too rapidly _ and in too helter-skelter a way _ for any
single company to mastermind its development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the Internet has taken China by storm, there are very
different proposals about how to develop it,'' said Don Xia, chief
executive of Unicom Media, a Hong Kong company that is developing
Internet services for China Unicom, one of the country's two main
telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   To Xia and others here, the debate is whether China's Internet
should be open or closed; raw or edited, anarchic or controlled.
Yip's company, they say, represents a more controlled,
government-directed approach. At the same time, hundreds of
small-time entrepreneurs, most of whom lack China Internet's
financial backing or political connections, are laboring to build a
truly free Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``CIC is out of step with what Internet users in China are
about,'' said Duncan Clark, managing director of BD Associates, a
telecommunications consulting firm in Beijing. ``I think companies
that make deals with them are actually doing themselves a
disservice.''
</P>
<P>
   The American companies that have made investments in China
Internet, or formed other kinds of partnerships with Yip, include
America Online, Bay Networks, Netscape Communications and Sun
Microsystems. And whatever the controversy that Yip may arouse, the
success of his sales pitch is proof that a Chinese Internet is no
longer just a utopian vision, but a ripe opportunity for sharp-eyed
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest government statistics, 1.18 million
people are using the Internet in mainland China _ nearly double the
number last October. While cyberspace is still largely the preserve
of 20-something men, it is growing beyond its roots as a tool for
academics. Nearly 80 percent of those surveyed said they had bought
merchandise over the Internet, and many said they used it for
information about entertainment, sports and business.
</P>
<P>
   After much hand-wringing, Beijing seems to have decided that the
benefits of the Internet outweigh its dangers, although it still
filters the content of the World Wide Web through central computers
and periodically blocks access to Web sites like those of CNN and
The New York Times. Beijing is also upgrading China's network to
carry more data, and it has licensed more than 30 companies to
offer Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese see the Internet as the savior of their economy,''
said Kenneth Farrall, a Web site designer who lives in Xiamen, in
southeastern China, and is starting an Internet consulting firm.
``My impression is that the people blocking Web sites are paying
lip service to the old guard in Beijing.''

</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the talk about openness, Internet executives here
say the government is still drawn to the idea of creating a vast
intranet within the country. Such a network could tap the Web's
riches but remain walled off from features deemed subversive _ like
pornographic sites, postings from dissidents or anything about
Taiwan or Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   China Internet's model is tailor made for this approach. The
company, which was started in 1994, operates a proprietary news
service called China Wide Web, which has about 1,000 subscribers.
For a fee of $30 to $340 a month, depending on the level of
service, subscribers receive stock quotations and news from the New
China News Agency, Reuters, Bloomberg, the Nikkei wire service and
Agence France-Presse. But they cannot gain Web access because the
service does not have an Internet connection. By contrast, the
majority of people in China who use a dial-up service to get Web
access pay a monthly fee of roughly $68 for unlimited use, plus
access charges amounting to 50 cents an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Yip said his long-term goal was to turn the China Wide Web into
a Chinese version of the World Wide Web, a vast consumer
marketplace with Chinese-language information and entertainment. He
said the lack of such content was the biggest hurdle to Internet
growth here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in New York and you get on the Web, and everything
coming at you is in Arabic, you're not going to stay on all that
long,'' said Yip, who lived in the United States for 20 years and
speaks rapid-fire English.
</P>
<P>
   Another analogy for the China Wide Web may be America Online, a
subscription-based service that organizes material in a form more
digestible than on the Internet. Not surprisingly, China Internet
has a partnership with America Online, in which the companies are
developing a Hong Kong version of America Online service.
</P>
<P>
   Yip's competitors point out that America Online has a link to
the World Wide Web, while the China Wide Web does not _ which keeps
the Internet's less acceptable material out of the country. ``The
China Wide Web is an attempt to create a Web that is isolated from
the Net,'' Clark of BD Associates said. ``We're kind of past that
already.''
</P>
<P>
   Yip acknowledged that the China Wide Web's lack of an Internet
connection was a weakness. But he said it was for financial, not
political, reasons: the dominant phone company, China Telecom, had
set access fees too high. Unless the government broke up China
Telecom's virtual phone monopoly, it would make no sense to offer
Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   China Internet's close ties to the New China News Agency mean
other restrictions. The agency has several editors in the company's
offices who sift through dispatches from the Western services and
pull any that run afoul of laws barring the distribution of
political news about Taiwan or Tibet. ``We're relying on Xinhua to
interpret Chinese law and ensure that we don't stray,'' Yip said,
using the press agency's Chinese name.
</P>
<P>
   So far, China Internet has skirted trouble by sticking to less
controversial business and financial news. Its other products
include inoffensive features like a Chinese-language site about the
World Cup and one about film star Bruce Lee. But Yip said that
merely by distributing Western news, China Internet was doing its
part to open the country.
</P>
<P>
   Yip, who started and sold several technology companies in the
United States before returning to his native Hong Kong in 1989,
said the industry's hostility reflected envy at his success in
attracting partners and frustration that most companies are still
losing money on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, by most yardsticks China Internet would not seem that
big a threat. It has fewer subscribers than many of China's
struggling Internet-access providers. It has less than $10 million
in revenue and is losing money, although Yip said he expected
annual revenue to exceed $25 million in 12 months. And a
much-publicized joint venture with Pointcast, the leading purveyor
of ``push'' technology on the Internet, fell apart because of
financial disagreements.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Yip has raised $25 million from investors, and he has
turned China Internet into the first stop for technology companies
seeking to capitalize on Internet growth.
</P>
<P>
   Some rivals said China Internet represented the triumph of
salesmanship over substance. ``It's like a Hong Kong-style
newspaper,'' said Edward Zeng, chief executive of Unicom-Sparkice,
another Internet venture backed by China Unicom. ``It's different
than a Western-style newspaper. There's more promotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Yip said he was wounded by the criticism. He said he had sought
to build bridges to the younger entrepreneurs, even introducing
some to executives or venture capitalists in the United States. ``I
don't want to be perceived as Big Brother, trying to control the
Internet,'' he said with a sigh.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Barry Diller hired Candice Carpenter to start
Q2, an upscale home shopping channel for QVC Inc. in 1994, the
words of wisdom he offered, she said, ran counter to everything she
had learned about business.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `Anything worth doing is worth doing badly,'''
said Ms. Carpenter, who had been a consumer marketing executive for
American Express and president of Time-Life Video and Television.
``Getting used to imperfection and evolving on the fly, for me, was
the most important takeaway.''
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, the notion that flaws are necessary ingredients of a
new business prepared her for what she describes as the ``wild
adolescence'' of the Internet, whose full surge she would
experience a year later. After a management change upon Diller's
departure from QVC, Ms. Carpenter also left the company and took
the leap from old media to new by creating the Web site
iVillage.com with a group of investors that included America
Online.
</P>
<P>
   iVillage.com began with little more than the premise ``Internet
for the rest of us'' and a focus on baby boomers. After
encountering its share of false starts (like a site, ``Vices and
Virtues,'' now defunct, about the competing forces of indulgence
and health), it has evolved into the leading women's online
``community'' on the Web. It attracted more than 2 million
different visitors during June, according to the Web measurement
company Relevant Knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Join our community of smart, compassionate, real women
today,'' the iVillage.com home page invites visitors, offering an
array of news, columns, advice and tips. Most important, though, it
offers ample opportunity for women to contribute their own views
through chat sessions and message boards on topics like ``Sex After
Kids'' and ``Anger Management.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the company has dealt with turnover of personnel and a
refocusing of its mission, the one constant has been Ms. Carpenter
and her ability to raise financing for the enterprise. The company
closed a fourth round of venture capital financing in May with
$32.5 million from 10 sources, bringing the total sum raised to $67
million.
</P>
<P>
   What is it that investors find attractive about an Internet
business for which profits are not yet in sight and which bills
itself amorphously in its new television advertising campaign as
``Your Home on the Web for the Stuff that Matters''? Besides the
large women's audience and its drawing power among advertisers,
iVillage.com's lure to investors is Ms. Carpenter herself, analysts
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a media celebrity,'' said Janet Stites, publisher of
Alley Cat News, a trade publication for investors. ``She's an
intriguing personality. Those things are very important when you're
raising money.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially when the medium for which one is raising money is
untested. Particularly in the early days of the World Wide Web,
when it was perceived as a technological oddity as much as a
burgeoning mass medium, the fact that Ms. Carpenter, 46, was not
another twenty-something Internet prodigy with no previous business
experience helped attract investors who wanted to test the waters.
</P>
<P>
   That iVillage.com shifted gears from a broader audience and
chose to focus on a demographic in demand didn't hurt, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``They picked a category that's very interesting,'' said Habib
Kairuz, the managing director of Rho Management, a recent investor
in iVillage.com. ``The trend continues to grow very nicely.'' Women
now make up half of all new Internet users, as opposed to just a
third two years ago.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The competition was not like that in search engines,'' Kairuz
said. ``This was a management team that really looked at what
worked on the Internet in establishing a new brand. They are not
looking at duplicating other mediums by simply putting their
content on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, iVillage.com has positioned itself as what could be
called the un-content provider. The emphasis is more on what
visitors to the site can contribute on the particulars of
parenthood, relationships and workplace issues, rather than on
top-tier columnists spouting advice and other more traditional
editorial offerings used by established media companies.
</P>
<P>
   Even its coming series of books, to be published by NTC
Contemporary, a division of Tribune Co., consists of information
culled from the users of iVillage.com's first Web offering, Parent
Soup.
</P>
<P>
   Along with more traditional marketing tactics, like a television
campaign, the company has hired Catheren Woolard, a city
councilwoman in Atlanta, to do grass-roots community building,
organizing volunteers around the country to act on behalf of
iVillage.com, and introducing the site to various nonprofit women's
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   This, Ms. Carpenter says, maximizes the strength of the medium
in which she dwells. ``We offer the intimacy of community with the
scale of media,'' she said, describing iVillage.com as
``utilitarian.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carpenter and her co-founders, Nancy Evans and Robert
Levitan _ who are also New York media veterans _ oversee a staff of
more than 200 who are scattered across two buildings in converted
loft space in Manhattan's Silicon Alley.
</P>
<P>
   Their site now attracts nearly twice the traffic of its nearest
competitor, Women.com, according to Relevant Knowledge. Such sites
deliver demographic gems to advertisers: high-income, well-educated
women.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carpenter has tried to generate revenue from three different
sources: advertising, sponsorship of specific areas of the site,
and product sales, including in its own online store, iBaby.
</P>
<P>
   It will take not only those elements but a lot more capital for
iVillage.com to prevail, Ms. Stites said. ``Experienced management
in the corporate world doesn't translate into experienced
management in the start-up world,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Ms. Carpenter said it took a ``gunslinger'' to
work in this industry. ``In the Internet, you've had to place
bigger bets in order to win,'' Ms. Carpenter said. ``I would not
want to be doing this without a media background.''

UTILITIES JOIN THE INTERNET-ACCESS BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a new power in the Internet access business: your
utility company.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of electric companies _ once slow-moving,
government-regulated monopolies _ are getting into one of the most
rapidly changing businesses. At least 100 utility companies offer
Internet access, including more than 30 of the nation's biggest
electricity providers, and dozens of others may follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   At the larger end are the likes of Arizona Public Service, whose
Phoenix-based subsidiary, Cyber Trails, has grown into one of the
top 10 Internet service companies in the state. At the other end of
the spectrum is Plumas-Sierra Rural Electric Cooperative, a power
provider nestled in the Northern Sierra Nevada mountains that also
serves about 2,000 dial-up Internet customers.
</P>
<P>
   Large or small, electric companies are moving into the Internet
business because of utility deregulation. Eighteen states have
opened their power industries to some form of competition, and most
others are expected eventually to do so as well. That means the
utilities not only have to learn to compete, they have more reason
to seek new sources of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many power companies already have the
telecommunications infrastructures that their Internet subsidiaries
could use to serve outside customers.
</P>
<P>
   So more than 100 utilities have turned to telecommunications,
including long-distance, wireless and local phone service, cable
television access, home security systems and, now, Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have another business in this building, another way to pay
rent,'' said Robert Marshall, general manager of Plumas-Sierra and
its Internet access subsidiary, Plumas-Sierra Local Net. ``It will
help us hold our own in the big wide world when electricity
deregulation hits.''
</P>
<P>
   The power companies are joining a host of other businesses in
trying to own a piece of the ground floor of cyberspace. Aspiring
Internet access providers range from mom-and-pop operations to
giant long-distance carriers like AT&AMP;T, MCI Communications and
Sprint, and radio and cable television stations. Even while there
has been some consolidation among large and regional Internet
service providers, their overall number has exploded to 4,850 from
1,500 in the last five years, according to Boardwatch Magazine, an
industry trade journal.
</P>
<P>
   The growth and diversity of Internet service providers means
``you can't even recognize what an ISP is anymore,'' said Jack
Rickard, editor of Boardwatch.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, power companies say providing Internet services
is a natural move for them. Across the country, many of the 180
large, investor-owned utilities own large fiber-optic networks that
they built for internal communication across states and among power
plants and field offices. They used only a portion of the capacity,
however, eventually leasing it out to telecommunications
businesses. Now, they are developing their own telecommunications
businesses, including Internet access, said John Castagna, a
spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute, an electric industry
trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Castagna said 30 to 40 major utilities were offering Internet
access and others were considering it.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the power companies say they understand other crucial
aspects of the Internet business: billing, customer service and
computer networking.
</P>
<P>
   ``You already have expertise on the communications and you
already have expertise on the computer networking,'' said Ben
Preusser, business manager for Cyber Trails in Phoenix. ``All you
need to do is drop a line to the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is not quite that easy. Since the utilities
themselves are regulated, any costs from the Internet business
cannot be passed on to power customers in the form of higher rates.
So the Internet subsidiaries must pay fees for using the utilities'
telecommunications infrastructure, and the start-up costs are the
responsibility of the utilities' parent companies and their
shareholders, not the utilities' rate payers.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Public Service invested more than $2 million to get its
Cyber Trails subsidiary up and running, Preusser said. This
involved buying modems, routers _which route Internet traffic to
the proper destination _ and establishing a high-speed line into
the backbone of the Internet. Cyber Trails also leases data lines
from US West and from Arizona Public Service.
</P>
<P>
   Cyber Trails, which began offering Internet access in March
1997, has 6,000 dial-up customers, adds 20 new ones a day, and has
one of the 10 largest subscriber bases in the state, Preusser said.
He said the company had marketed aggressively, going after rural
areas that national Internet service providers had ignored, and
also had contracts to provide access to several Indian
reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Preusser said the new business was helping Arizona Public
Service learn about the challenges of moving into a new business in
a competitive marketplace _ knowledge that should prove beneficial
as the utility heads into a deregulated and much more competitive
electricity marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different set of skills,'' he said. ``It turns out that
just leveraging your existing technology doesn't work all that
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Heiberger, an energy and telecommunications consultant in
Philadelphia, has a similar view, noting that the relatively low
cost of offering Internet access gives utilities the chance to
experiment with a new business model. ``They're practicing running
a competitive business to see what it looks like,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Heiberger, who has written extensively on the efforts by
utilities to offer Internet access, said there was no guarantee
that power companies could succeed in this business. On the one
hand, she said, they have infrastructure, marketing, brand
recognition and customer service experience; on the other, they are
not accustomed to the fast-moving world of technology.

   Still, the potential problems did not discourage Carolina Power
and Light, which serves 1.1 million residences with electricity,
from entering the Internet business. In January, it acquired
Interpath Communications, a company that provides consulting, Web
page hosting and design, and Internet access to 4,500 businesses in
North Carolina, as well as surrounding states.
</P>
<P>
   The experience of Carolina Power and Light also highlights an
approach taken by dozens of utility companies entering the
telecommunications business: Rather than building from scratch, as
in Arizona, they are buying existing Internet companies or signing
joint ventures with major telecommunications providers. A year ago,
for example, a subsidiary of Potomac Electric Power Co., which
serves Maryland and the District of Columbia, pledged to spend $150
million to develop long-distance, cable television and Internet
services in partnership with RCN Corp., a major telecommunications
provider.
</P>
<P>
   There are other reasons some utilities turn to the Internet.
Warren Dunn, director of communication for National Rural Electric
Cooperative Association, said that at least 60 of the nation's
1,000 rural cooperatives offered Internet access, in part because
they consider it part of their charter to serve their communities.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, the general manager of Plumas-Sierra, said the utility
cooperative felt it had a responsibility to provide Internet access
in a region others were ignoring.
</P>
<P>
   Before the electric company started its Internet subsidiary in
the fall of 1995, residents of the area had to place a
long-distance call to get Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt advanced technology would not be available unless we
stepped up to do the job,'' Marshall said.

Mac News: Ascend personal manager doesn't quite measure up 
By Charles Haddad  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ascend, based on a philosophy of life management, is a popular
personal information manager among PC users. The Mac version,
though, works and feels like an afterthought by the publisher.
</P>
<P>
   It's buggy and missing some major features now standard in most
Mac personal information managers such as Claris Organizer, Now
Up-To-Date (soon to be renamed Eudora Planner) and Consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Still, those who value the emphasis on life goals might like
Ascend. The program holds true to that philosophy, which isn't the
case for any other personal information manager.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, the philosophy asks you to think deeply about
what's important to you and then prioritize your life accordingly.
That is, if you want to be a writer, focus on writing well and not
on how many things you write.
</P>
<P>
   Ascend is the software incarnation of this philosophy. The
program asks you to think about your values, prioritize them and
then come up with a plan to achieve them.
</P>
<P>
   Ascend translates your plan into a series of tasks you can check
off day to day and keep track of your progress toward the greater
goal.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the deeper look at scheduling, Ascend includes a
journal feature. It lets you record your daily thoughts and
feelings. This is not a feature unique to Ascend, since many other
personal information managers now include journals.
</P>
<P>
   Like all of today's personal information managers, Ascend
includes a calendar, a to-do list and an address file. To-dos and
notes can be linked to contacts and contacts linked to to-dos.
</P>
<P>
   The program also lets you store random bits of information such
as a Social Security number or a password. But this feature is not
well integrated into the rest of the program. You can't link these
tidbits of information to contacts or to-dos.
</P>
<P>
   What you won't find in Ascend is a menu bar icon that lets you
quickly enter new items without launching the program. Organizer,
Consultant and Now Up-To-Date all have this feature.
</P>
<P>
   There are also a number of annoying bugs. The calendar doesn't
open up on the current day, and the feature designed to let you
import addresses from another personal information manager doesn't
work at all.
</P>
<P>
   Published by Franklin Covey, Ascend 4.1 retails for about $100.

Cyberscene: Free e-mail offers good in most cases 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Despite grumbling from old-time Internet users, some
of the best things on the Net are still free.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, some things that weren't free in the old days
--e-mail, for instance -- are available from a number of sources
without paying a penny.
</P>
<P>
   Just to be clear, most of the free e-mail services require you
already have a way to connect to the Internet. There are exceptions
but, most commonly, these services are most often used by people
who already have access to the Net at school or work.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush then, the idea seems dumb. If you have access to
the Net already, you probably have the ability to send e-mail. So
why sign up for one of these free services?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they're increasingly popular for several reasons: (1)
You'll get a permanent e-mail address that won't change the next
time you change Internet providers; (2) For those who have access
to the Net only through work or school, it's a way to send and
receive e-mail privately; and (3) Even if you have trouble
accessing your Internet provider while traveling, these services
will be available from any computer that can log on to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   There are literally dozens of free e-mail services, and the list
grows by the week. Our first stop will be at a service called Hot
Mail. Now while that may conjure up images of, uh, steamy e-mail,
Hot Mail is provided by Microsoft. You can find out about the
service at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .hotmail.com/. Then, if you like what you see, you can sign up
at the same address.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, signing up is easy, unless you mind answering a few
questions about your income and level of education. You should be
able to complete the questions in about two minutes, and your new
e-mail address will become effective immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo!, which is known best for its search engine, also offers
free e-mail. The system is so similar there's no need to go into
detail. Just go to Yahoo! at http://www.yahoo.com/ and look for the
link to the free e-mail system.
</P>
<P>
   That's the thing you'll notice immediately about all the
Web-based e-mail systems. All of them seem to work the same way.
But if you're shopping for an e-mail service, take the time to read
about the extras offered. Besides free e-mail, some of the sites
offer an electronic filter that will remove some (but not all) junk
e-mail; others have free reminder services (for instance, sending
you an automatic note to remind you it's time to start shopping for
an anniversary gift).
</P>
<P>
   At Bigfoot.Com (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .bigfoot.com/), you'll be offered these types of features as
well as a free auto-responder. What's that? It's a program that
automatically responds to your e-mail, even when you can't. For
instance, when you're on vacation, you could set the auto-responder
to thank the sender for the e-mail and promise to respond when you
get back.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of other free e-mail services, but -- unless
you would enjoy making a lifetime project out of testing each one
-- most people will be pleased with one of the services already
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   But what about folks who don't have Internet access? None of the
services that we've discussed will help in a case like that.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the original free e-mail providers, Juno, not only
gives you a free e-mail account, it also gives you a way to connect
-- usually through a local telephone number -- free. There are just
two catches -- and considering the fact you won't pay a cent to use
Juno, they don't seem out of line: (1) You'll have to put up with
the advertising that bombards all Juno e-mail customers each time
you connect; and (2) While your e-mail address will let you send
and receive any Internet mail, your free Juno account doesn't
entitle you to any other Internet services such as Web browsing.

Notebooks have crisis of proportions 
By Michael E. Kanell  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- There is in human nature a battle between big and
small, the fascination with what is tiny vs. the awe of bigness.
</P>
<P>
   Some things get cooler as they get smaller. Wireless phones,
silicon chips, quarks, Thumbelina. And, of course, we want some
things to be as big as can be: pro football linemen, Godzilla, the
World Trade Center, Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Technology -- natch -- is only too happy to oblige either
impulse.
</P>
<P>
   You want a sport-utility vehicle the size of a township? You
plunk down a few months salary and it's yours. You want a miniature
speaker for your stereo? No problem. Sometimes we want smaller,
sometimes bigger.
</P>
<P>
   But now, notebook computers seem caught between the competing
urges.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, the very existence of notebooks seems proof that
people need smaller, lighter computers. The only limit to building
smaller ones seemed to be the size of people's hands -- keyboards
had to be large enough to give us a fighting chance at typing. And
you recall the original notebooks with their three lines of
semi-legible type.
</P>
<P>
   Yet now, notebooks are trying to grow at the same time they
maintain their portability. More specifically, many notebooks are
being made with larger screens -- up to 15.1-inch displays. The
user gets a better picture, often with souped-up sound and graphics
as well.
</P>
<P>
   But the result for those models -- increasingly defining the
high end of the market -- are notebooks that are larger and
heavier. Some even check in at 10 pounds or more.
</P>
<P>
   In the July issue of Mobile Computing &AMP; Communications,
reviewers took on 16 notebooks, each with displays measuring 13.3
inches or more diagonally. Among the machines tested:
</P>
<P>
   -- AMS Tech's Rodeo 3040ECX draws praise for speed and ability
to support several storage devices. However, sigh the reviewers, it
is large and heavy and the display is ``a bit dull.'' For
information on the $3,900 notebook, call the company (626-814-0782)
or visit its Web site (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .amstech.com).
</P>
<P>
   -- IBM's ThinkPad 600, a $4,934 notebook, is fast, thin and --at
6.5 pounds -- light of weight in the large-display category,
according to reviewers. For more information, call the company
(1-800-426-7255) or visit its Web site (http://www.ibm.com
</P>
<P>
   /thinkpad).
</P>
<P>
   -- Hewlett-Packard's OmniBook 4100 also won generally good
reviews. The $4,274 machine is thin, performs well and offers both
good display and long battery life, reviewers say. For more
information, call the company (1-800-322-4772) or visit its Web
site (http://www.hp.com).
</P>
<P>
   -- VisionBook Pro 7590 from Hitachi costs $4,134 and performs
well, reviewers say. Unfortunately the keyboard is poorly designed
and the battery anemic by comparison to other Pentium notebooks.
For information, call the company (1-800-555-6820) or visit its Web
site (http://www.hitachipc.com).
</P>
<P>
   Using your thumb to travel
</P>
<P>
   Just how you get from place to place is a very personal,
idiosyncratic choice.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind whether you prefer car, bus, taxi, plane, train or
foot power. How do you navigate across the frontier of the screen
in your personal computer? Most PC users started with typing the
complex codes needed for DOS. Thanks to folks like Apple Computer,
the much quicker mouse with the more user-friendly interface became
common. (Although Xerox scientists are generally credited with the
invention.)
</P>
<P>
   A California outfit now suggests that the truly ``natural,
intuitive link between people and computers'' is really the
thumb-operated trackball.
</P>
<P>
   Logitech, which is based in Fremont, Calif., says its TrackMan
Marble is a more advanced cousin of the trackballs used in many
laptop computers. The device results from four years of research
and uses ``advanced optics and neural network logic'' to detect
movement and pass along the information to the computer, according
to Logitech. The result, the company claims, is a control of the
cursor that is fast and precise.
</P>
<P>
   The device also has three mouse buttons, which can be
customized, letting you assign a function to a button. Traditional
trackball technology is subject to problems with dust, as well as
chemical reactions between metal and oil or with the user's skin,
Logitech says.
</P>
<P>
   The TrackMan Marble works with IBM-compatible systems and
requires Microsoft Windows 95 or Windows NT for scrolling, although
it can be used as a standard mouse with Windows 3.1. Unfortunately,
TrackMan Marble is not yet engineered to be compatible with Apple,
the original user-friendly computer.
</P>
<P>
   Suggested list price for the device is $80.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, call the company's sales office in North
Miami Beach (510-795-8500) or visit the company Web site
(http://www.logitech.com).
</P>
<P>
   Code or Kierkegaard?
</P>
<P>
   Programming over Proust. That's the conventional wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   It is assumed by many that the route to the techiest of the
high-tech jobs passes through a university's engineering or
computer department or some trade school equivalent. It does seem
logical, after all, that computer programming courses are the path
to computer programming.
</P>
<P>
   But Ellen Ullman, a software engineer and author, says that is
the exact wrong way to produce the next generation of great
techies.
</P>
<P>
   In an opinion piece in The New York Times, Ullman argues that
the very idea of a computer science degree is relatively new and
may be misguided. She notes that no one can teach tomorrow's
programmers what the cutting edge will be, since it doesn't exist.
More importantly, she says old-style educations were well-suited to
training someone for an industry that was in constant flux and
frequent revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we knew was how to learn, which is all that one can hang
on to in a profession in which change is relentless. The generation
of programmers who followed us were, well, disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   They just didn't seem to have a clue about anything but
computers, she sighs.
</P>
<P>
   Ullman is author of ``Close to the Machine: Technophilia and Its
Discontents,'' whose title is itself a reference to a certain
well-known work read by many students in liberal arts. Ullman says
schools should stress subjects ``that foster a flexible and open
mind,'' rather than the latest skills, which will become obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   Most important is education in the broadest sense, she wrote.
``Programmers seem to be changing the world. It would be a relief,
for them and for all of us, if they knew something about it.''

<HEADLINE>
STRATUS TO BE ABSORBED BY ASCEND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By RONALD ROSENBERG   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stratus Computer Inc., a pioneer maker of failsafe computer
systems that was founded 17 years ago, will soon be dismantled
following its $843 million acquisition by Ascend Communications
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The merger of Stratus of Marlborough, Mass. and Ascend of
Alameda, Calif. was announced Monday after being widely rumored
last week. It is the latest in a string of deals among computer
networking and telecommunications companies as the Internet
explosion leads to a convergence of voice and data communications.
</P>
<P>
   Ascend, a maker of data networking switches, is buying Stratus
primarily for its technology and products sold to telephone
carriers to manage their networks and blend voice and data traffic.
That business unit of Stratus _ one of four _ had $220 million in
revenue last year.
</P>
<P>
   After the $843 million stock swap is completed in the late fall,
Ascend will sell Stratus' three remaining business units _ with
$466 milliion in 1997 revenue _ as well as Stratus' corporate name.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had several active inquiries from companies looking
into what we plan to divest. I just cannot name them now,'' said
Bruce Sachs, Stratus president and chief executive. Sachs had been
shifting the company into telecommunications since becoming CEO in
May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition will lead to a series of employment changes at
Stratus. About 500 jobs will be terminated, including 350 that were
targeted last month when the compnay announced a 20 percent drop in
revenue for the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   That would leave Stratus with about 1,900 employees. Only 400 to
450 of those employees will become part of Ascend, while the other
1,500 would join the company or companies that eventually acquire
the bulk of Stratus, said Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs said that of the 500 who will lose their jobs _ half of
them in Massachusetts _ some will be considered for new jobs at
Ascend, which has its East Coast headquarters in the Westford,
Mass. offices of the former Cascade Communications Corp., a
computer networking company Ascend acquired last year for $3.7
billion.
</P>
<P>
   After the Stratus acquisition and divestitures and some
additional hiring by Ascend, the California company will have more
than half its work force in Massachusetts, Ascend said.
</P>
<P>
   To buy Stratus, Ascend will swap 0.75 of its shares for each of
Stratus' 24 million outstanding shares, excluding options. Based on
Ascend's closing price Monday of46 13/16, up 2 11/32, the deal
values Stratus at $35.11 a share, which is slightly higher than
Stratus' closing price Monday of $33.75. Stratus shares rose 4 7/8
in very heavy trading Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The premium has dwindled considerably since last week when
rumors of a pending deal leaked out, causing Stratus shares to rise
and Ascend's to fall.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who were skeptical last week were more positive about
the deal Monday. The acquisition of key Stratus technology will
enable Ascend to better compete against larger rivals such as
Lucent Technologies Inc., said analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Ascend is mainly buying Stratus for its products and services
for telephone carriers. It is a leading supplier in that market,
selling to 27 of the 30 largest players. Stratus sells them
specialized computers and software that run Signaling System 7
technology, or SS7, which enables phone companies to route voice
and data traffic over data networks and to incorporate
``value-added'' services such as call forwarding, credit card
verification and 800 calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can leapfrog the competition by several years,'' said Mory
Ejabat, Ascend president and chief executive officer. ``We can now
expand into new areas, become an Internet backbone provider and
take our products across the country and into Europe.''

 Does Your Net Provider Eavesdrop?

<P>
   Q: We live in a small town. I know my Internet service provider.
Can he easily ``eavesdrop'' on my Internet activities? Does he know
which Web sites I visit? Can he read my incoming and outgoing
e-mail?
</P>
<P>
   A: Dear paranoid: Yes, he can. According to the Electronic
Privacy Information Center in Washington, D.C., it's not hard
technically for an ISP to track the Web wanderings of customers.
But EPIC Policy Director David Banisar said most ISPs _ even small
ones _ are unlikely to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average ISP probably isn't doing it just because it's
fairly burdensome,'' said EPIC policy director David Banisar. ``It
would take up a lot of space and slow down their systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have had Windows 98 since the day it was released and find
it to be absolutely no improvement over Windows 95. Actually, I
feel I was better off with Windows 95 and would like to uninstall
the 98 version. But after warnings from friends that I could lose
other needed items or create new problems by uninstalling, I am
really afraid to do it.
</P>
<P>
   A: Fear not. Uninstalling Windows 98 is a quick, painless
experience that restores your system to the way it was before you
upgraded. However, to remove the new system, you must have saved
the old one. If you selected the Save Your System Files during the
upgrade process, you're in business. Go to Start/Settings/Control
Panel and double-click Add/Remove Programs. Scroll down until you
get to the option for uninstalling Windows 98. Select it, and click
Add/Remove.
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of other situations that prevent you from
uninstalling Windows 98. You can't do it if the operating system is
installed on a compressed hard disk. And if you converted your disk
to FAT32 after installing Windows 98, you're also out of luck.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I hate being on somebody's Buddy List in America Online. I
find the interruptions extremely annoying when people send me
instant messages. How can I stop receiving messages from my
so-called buddies?
</P>
<P>
   A: Here's what to do: Use the keyword ``Buddy'' to go to the
Buddy List Setup box. Then click Privacy Preferences at the bottom.
Here you'll find a number of options letting you keep people from
adding you to their buddy lists. You can filter out just specific
users you don't want as buddies, or if you really feel anti-social,
you can block everybody. By the way, I agree with you, there's
nothing as irksome as getting an unsolicited greeting from someone
online.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm the only one who uses my computer, and I neither need nor
want a Windows password. So I'd love to get rid of that Password
box that always comes on the screen before Windows 95 boots up. Is
there any way to eliminate this minor but persistent irritant?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sure. Here's how. First, delete the file that stores your
password. It has the same name as your user name, followed by the
extension .pwl. So if your user name is Jodie, the file will be
named Jodie.pwl. Go to Windows Explorer in the Windows Program
menu, and you'll find the .pwl file in the Windows folder.
Right-click it, and choose Delete from the pop-up menu.
</P>
<P>
   Now restart the computer. This time, when you see the Windows
Password dialog box, don't enter anything into the space for the
password. Just click OK. This will assign a blank password, and you
should not see the password prompt again.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I send a resume to a company by e-mail without having
to type it into the message itself? And how can I be sure they'll
be able to read it?
</P>
<P>
   A: What you want to do is send the resume as an attachment. All
e-mail programs let you attach files to e-mail messages. To make
sure the file is readable at the other end, the best thing is to
create it in Microsoft Word for Windows _ the word processor used
by the majority of companies.
</P>
<P>
   By sending the resume as an attached Word file, you can fire off
a resume that looks just like one you'd send in the mail or deliver
in person, complete with boldfacing, underlining, italics and
special margins.
</P>
<P>

NASCAR ONLINE PUTS FANS IN RACE WITH SCANNER FEATURE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By TOMMY CUMMINGS  
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hot, yet you want to get close to some serious NASCAR
racing without having to fight a massive traffic jam or make a
bathroom run with thousands of other sweating gear heads.
</P>
<P>
   The advice here: Stay home.
</P>
<P>
   Stay home and tune in to conversations between Winston Cup
Series teams and drivers via a multi-frequency scanner now
available on the Internet or on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR Online (www.nascar.com), NASCAR's official site, made
this happen last week when it reached a licensing agreement with
MotorTrax Interactive of Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   MotorTrax has created a feature similar to the scanners
available at the speedway. For $12.95 per event, fans can
selectively tune to radio communications between 27 popular drivers
and teams by accessing NASCAR Online.
</P>
<P>
   During Winston Cup races, MotorTrax gathers and feeds radio
transmissions via satellite and packages them for NASCAR Online
users.
</P>
<P>
   Users will need a computer equipped with a standard sound card
and a 14.4-kilobytes-per-second modem. Real Audio 4.0 software will
be necessary to play the audio stream. Fans can also choose
transmissions from their phone key pad.
</P>
<P>
   Blake Davidson, NASCAR senior manager of marketing technology,
said MotorTrax's technology has allowed ``fans to feel as if they
are sitting in the grandstands listening ... on a scanner.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Anderson, chief executive officer of MotorTrax's parent
company, Long Distance Technologies Inc., said in a news release he
recognizes NASCAR's success has been in getting fans close to the
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``By enabling NASCAR fans anywhere in the world to go live into
the communication loop between the driver and his pit crew, we're
taking that concept to a much higher level,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Like any multimedia feature on the 'Net, especially audio, the
technology isn't flawless.
</P>
<P>
   The transmission, which is scanner quality to begin with, can
sound a little ragged. Also, it is not live, so expect a 20- to
30-second delay. The number of simultaneous listeners is limited,
so it's first-come, first-serve for paying customers. BYTES Don't
forget: With two-a-day practices scheduled to start this week, John
``Buck'' Cargal of Fort Worth plans to keep fans updated with
reports on his JBC Pigskin Prep (www.pigskinprep.com). ... On
Wednesday, Dallas-based Beckett Auction Services (www.beckett.com)
is taking online bids for the 1909-11 Honus Wagner T206 tobacco
card. Opening bid is expected to be $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Let's get official: Rangers catcher Ivan Rodriguez has an
official home on the 'Net at Athletic Direct on AOL (keyword:
athletedirect). Rodriguez is one of seven major-league players
affiliated with the site. His site includes a daily journal, images
and a chat area. Athlete Direct also has the official homes for
Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman and Chicago Bulls forward Dennis
Rodman. ... Texas Tech's official athletic site should get
increased exposure thanks to a content agreement with the FANSonly
Network (www.fansonly.com) and CBS SportsLine. FANSonly, which
produces the Texas Tech site along with 39 college sites, will be
integrated into CBS SportsLine's college football and men's
basketball areas. The two-year agreement calls for SportsLine to
create areas on its college team pages for each school
participating in the FANSonly Network.

Tech Tools: Time passes swimmingly with virtual aquarium 
By Jack Warner  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Life in the virtual world, apparently, is nothing if
not swift. Within 72 hours of setting up her virtual aquarium, one
of my granddaughter's virtual fish got sick, had to be transferred
to the virtual hospital tank and given virtual medicine that made
it virtually well.
</P>
<P>
   All this courtesy of Mindscape's Aquazone Deluxe, a program that
runs on both PC and Macintosh platforms.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I must tell you I have not seen much of this program
myself. Most people consider me an animal lover, but that is not
entirely accurate. I am a mammal lover.
</P>
<P>
   So when this virtual aquarium floated in over the transom, I
decided it would be good to run it by my creature-loving
granddaughter, Allyson. Allyson is 7; her sister Lauren, a
dark-eyed beauty, is 9, and at the moment Lauren's attention is
directed to fashion and clothes and social pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   Allyson was quite interested, as it turned out, and was very
restless until we got around to installing the program. Once
installed, I did little more than help her select one of the dozen
pre-organized aquariums. The program comes with no printed manual,
but there is extensive online help, so I left her reading the
instructions.
</P>
<P>
   My wife and I had to go home soon, but we met the grandkids for
dinner that night and I got an earful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grandpa Jack, Grandpa Jack,'' Allyson cried, even before we
were seated. ``I put five fish in the aquarium! I learned how to
condition the water! I fed 'em right away and they were really,
really hungry!''
</P>
<P>
   She had also removed a plant she found less than adequate to her
purposes, and replaced it with another from a menu. Using dialogue
boxes, she had selected each fish she wanted for the aquarium by
type and age. Getting fish of different ages helps her tell one
fish from another of the same species. This is useful, because
names are also chosen for each fish.
</P>
<P>
   That was on Friday. On Sunday morning, we met for brunch, and
she wasn't out of the car before it was ``Grandpa Jack! One of my
fish is sick!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Roger,'' she said breathlessly. ``He's my false
runny-nosed tetra!'' I determined later that Roger is actually a
false rummy-nosed tetra, but for all I know he had a runny nose
when he got sick. At any rate, she described how the computer told
her that Roger was sick, in the early stages of some disease I
didn't quite catch, and needed immediate attention. He was moved to
a properly sanitized hospital tank, free of plant life and,
presumably, any virtual bacteria. Then the computer told her which
medicine to put in the tank, and how much.
</P>
<P>
   She seemed confident of a full recovery, since the disease had
been caught in its early stages.
</P>
<P>
   Aquazone comes complete with various plants and colored gravel,
a pump and thermometer. You can make your own objets d'art _ you
know, little divers and sunken ships and the like _ to dress up the
tank. There's also an unlimited supply of food and medicine.
However, the folks who created this thing didn't fall off the fresh
snapper truck yesterday, and they have ways of hooking more money
out of your pocket.
</P>
<P>
   At $30, Aquazone comes with all the neon tetra and leopard
catfish you can use. However, there are only five each of red
phantom tetra, angelfish, false rummy-nose tetra and black mollies.
If you run out, or want more, there is a Web site where you can go
to buy $10 CDs that contain new kinds of fish and other goodies.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the catch to all this is that your fish are swimming,
getting hungry, risking disease and even breeding whether the
computer is turned on or not. Thus, if you don't want any grisly
surprises and a computer that smells virtually like dead fish,
you'll want to check on things regularly. We are already committed
to caring for Jerry the cavy while the kids are on vacation. I
wonder if we'll have to drive 30 actual miles to their house every
day to feed the virtual fish.

TechnoBuddy: Extra tools come in handy when exploring the Net 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I have a friend with a two-piece tool kit that
contains a screwdriver _ she holds the blade and whacks balky
devices with its handle _ and a hammer, used when a whack from the
screwdriver isn't quite enough.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, malfunctioning dishwashers or steam irons sometimes
start working after a good pounding. So I'm not here to criticize.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the Internet, many of my friends have just two
``tools'' for using it: a Web browser and an e-mail program. And,
like my friend's hammer and screwdriver, these tools suit them just
fine. If you fit into that category, there's no reason to change.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a whole lot of Internet out there and _ if you want
to explore off the beaten track _ you'll need a few extra tools.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most useful software tools for the Internet is an FTP
program. The initials stand for File Transfer Protocol, and in
earlier days on the Net, almost everyone had one. As you'd guess,
an FTP program is used to upload and download files.
</P>
<P>
   Most any Web browser can download files, but FTP programs work
faster and better. And if you have a Web page, the program is
danged near indispensable since you'll be uploading files to it
regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, there are some great FTP sites on the Net that contain
free and low-cost programs ready for downloading. Most FTP programs
come pre-programmed with a list of these sites.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite FTP program is WS-FTP. You can get versions for
Windows 3.1, Windows 95/98 or Windows NT. You can download it (just
use your Web browser) at http://www.ipswitch.com/
</P>
<P>
   Products/WS(underscore)FTP/index.html.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a Macintosh user, you might try a program called
Fetch. I've used it for several years and like it a lot. Just point
at the file you want, drag it to your machine and you're done.
You'll be able to get a copy of Fetch at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .dartmouth.edu/pages/softdev/fetch
</P>
<P>
   .html.
</P>
<P>
   The next stop on our tour of the backwaters of the Net is the
newsgroups. Long before there was a World Wide Web, Internet users
shared information about hobbies and professions using the
newsgroups. (As time moved along, the newsgroups became infamous
for some really bizarre X-rated material so _ if you're a parent or
just don't like to be exposed to this type of stuff _ step
cautiously here.) The newsgroups still are the best choice for
finding answers (and experts) when it comes to special interests
from astronomy to the life cycle of zebras.
</P>
<P>
   Just as is true with file transfers, your browser will give you
access to the newsgroups. But anyone who has ever used a browser
for that purpose knows how clunky it is. Before long, you'll either
give up on the browser as a way to visit newsgroups or give up
newsgroups.
</P>
<P>
   Windows users should check out a program called News Xpress. You
can download it at http://tucows.c-plusnet.com
</P>
<P>
   /news95.html. When it comes to browsing the newsgroups with my
Mac, there's no contest at all. A program called Newswatcher is my
all-time favorite. You can get it at http://charlotte.at.nwu.edu
</P>
<P>
   /jln/progs.ssi.
</P>
<P>
   News readers and FTP programs are just the start. Once you start
traveling the backwaters of the Net, it's difficult to stop. Before
you're done, you'll want a Telnet program (you can use it to
control other computers on the Net), tools to play online games,
programs to analyze and fix Internet problems, programs to measure
the performance of your Internet connection and lots more.
</P>
<P>
   Since we can't cover them all today, let me point you toward an
excellent Web site that both explains how these programs work and
then offers you the chance to download them free. You'll find
versions for both Macintosh and Windows machines here. It's called
Tucows and is at http://www.tucows.com.

SEC requiring disclosure of Y2K readiness 
By Rob Chambers  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Y2K is related to Catch-22.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Securities and Exchange Commission issued new
guidelines that require a public company to provide Y2K information
in certain documents it files with the SEC. Such disclosures are
supposed to include the company's Year 2000 costs, readiness, risks
and contingency plans.
</P>
<P>
   Catch-22 kicks in because corporations have feared putting out
that kind of information would invite lawsuits. By some estimates,
lawyers will earn $1 trillion from Y2K litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Given such corporate fears, a less formal request by the SEC
earlier in the year did not produce much of a response.
</P>
<P>
   Now, ``the commission has made it clear that Year 2000
disclosure must be made,'' said spokesman John Heine.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines do exempt a company that's completed its Y2K
assessment or a company that's determined it doesn't have a
problem. But owing to the breadth and complexity of potential
difficulties, ``such as embedded system and third party interface
issues,'' Robert O. Ball of Atlanta's Alston &AMP; Bird law firm, says
``the guidelines essentially mandate some sort of Year 2000
disclosure from just about all public companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news: The SEC has spelled out examples of what
information it's seeking and has indicated Y2K disclosures are the
sort of ````forward looking statements'' covered by the Private
Securities Reform Act of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   That legislation protects a public company against private
lawsuits when company estimates about the future turn out to be
inaccurate. But the company must have made those projections in
good faith.
</P>
<P>
   Ball said ``those protections should provide some comfort to
companies making Year 2000 disclosures.'' But, he said, ``a
company's disclosures are going to require some careful thought and
advice.''
</P>
<P>
   The flip side: If companies ``don't disclose Year 2000
information, they're opening themselves up to lawsuits under the
securities laws,'' said Heine.
</P>
<P>
   For more information about the SEC Y2K guidelines, visit the
commission's Web site at http://www.sec.gov.

 Amazon.com Acquires 2 Internet Firms  
By Jamie Beckett  
c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amazon.com announced two acquisitions yesterday that could help
turn the online bookseller into an Internet shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of its high-flying stock, Amazon.com said it
will issue 2.4 million new shares worth about $280 million to buy
two Internet firms _ Sunnyvale-based Junglee and PlanetAll of
Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Junglee makes the ``virtual database,'' a software program that
lets Internet surfers comparison shop.
</P>
<P>
   PlanetAll provides a Web-based address book, calendar and
reminder service to 1.5 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long-term vision is a person should be able to come to
Amazon.com and find any product they may want to buy,'' said David
Risher, senior vice president of marketing and product development
at the Seattle-based company.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street seemed to like the idea. Amazon.com's shares rose
$1.63 to $109.88 on a day when most technology stocks suffered
heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazon.com has the ability to become an Internet mall,'' said
Mark Peabody, a research analyst at the Aberdeen Group in Boston.
Its well-known brand name can attract shoppers looking for items
other than the books and CDs it now sells, Peabody said.
</P>
<P>
   By offering more varied merchandise, such as the computer
hardware and software, clothing and gifts now offered by Junglee,
Amazon.com can attract more shoppers _ and more advertisers, said
Alexis de Planque, an analyst at the Meta Group in Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   For advertisers, ``it's not enough to just get people to the
store. It's how long they stay there,'' said de Planque. With
reminders about family birthdays and special events and other
services, PlanetAll gives Web surfers another reason to visit
Amazon's site as well as more to do there, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon will issue 1.6 million shares worth about $173.2 million
for Junglee and 800,000 shares valued at about $86.6 million for
PlanetAll. It also will assume the companies' options obligations.
The acquisitions will dilute Amazon's outstanding shares by about 6
percent, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com lost $21 million on sales of $116 million in the
latest quarter, although much of the loss was due to three smaller
acquisitions announced in April.
</P>
<P>
   Privately held Junglee was founded in 1996 by a group of
Stanford students and is now available on Yahoo, Snap and other
Internet gateways. Junglee aggregates thousands of job listings and
products from dozens of merchants, including such Amazon
competitors as Barnes and Noble and Borders Books.
</P>
<P>
   Ram Shriram, Junglee president and chief operating officer, said
he expected to be able to continue carrying goods offered by Amazon
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   When the acquisition is completed, the Sunnyvale company will
move to Seattle. All 60 employees have been offered the chance to
move, said Shriram.
</P>
<P>
   By joining forces with Amazon, Junglee can extend its reach
further than it would have on its own, he said.
</P>
<P>
   PlanetAll, a privately held 40-person company, will remain in
Cambridge.

AMAZON.COM MOVES TO LIFT INTERNET PRESENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a move indicating that its aspirations extend to
selling far more than books over the Internet, Amazon.com said
Tuesday it had bought Junglee Corp., which operates a service that
lets people shop for everything from clothing to computers.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Amazon.com also bought Planet All, which operates a
vast Internet address service that allows people to stay in touch
with their friends and associates. Amazon.com hopes to sell books
and its expanding variety of goods to Planet All's 1.5 million
members.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com will exchange stock worth $187 million _ at Monday's
closing price _ for Junglee and stock worth $93 million for Planet
All. Both companies are privately held.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com has grown to be the most successful merchant on the
Internet, with 3.1 million customers. It posted sales of $203
million in the first half, a nearly fivefold increase from the
comparable period a year earlier. Its losses, totaling $30 million
in the first half, have also accelerated, but not quite as fast.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the company's stock has surged, bringing the paper wealth
of Jeff Bezos, the former stock trader who founded the company, to
more than $2.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Amazon.com's only expansion beyond books has been to add
music compact disks earlier this year. But Bezos said in an
interview Tuesday, ``We're at an inflection point where we are now
looking at a broader range of products.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to its handling of books and music, Amazon.com does
not necessarily plan to sell other products directly, Bezos said.
Rather, it will help customers find merchandise from other Internet
stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus has always been to help people find and discover
things they want to buy,'' Bezos said. ``We're not limited to
selling our own stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bezos declined to discuss how the company expected to earn
money from this plan, analysts said the most likely way was to earn
a commission from stores to which it refers customers.
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the main business lines of Junglee, which makes
software to pull together disparate information from all over the
Internet for comparison. Junglee operates comparison shopping
services, offered on various Internet sites including Yahoo, that
let users see the prices and terms for all sorts of products. What
is not disclosed on these sites is that some companies that Junglee
lists in these comparisons pay Junglee for referrals.
</P>
<P>
   Junglee's site on Yahoo shows that Amazon.com does not offer the
lowest prices for many books. Bezos said that under Amazon.com's
wing, Junglee would cut back on this sort of price comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think that customers find price comparisons very
useful,'' he said. ``We would rather help people discover exactly
what they're looking for online.''
</P>
<P>
   Bezos declined to say when Amazon.com would start offering new
services through Junglee, but he said that the company's expansion
would be relatively slow.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Amazon.com has already started exploiting the sales
opportunities on Planet All through e-mail messages that encourage
members to buy birthday gifts for their friends from Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Planet All users enter their name, phone numbers, address,
birthday and other information into the system, and they specify
which other members can see that information. That way when they
move, for example, all of their contacts are notified of the
change. The company, founded by Warren Adams, a former banking
consultant, has added a range of features such as the ability to
network by searching lists of the friends of your friends.
</P>
<P>
   So far the company has not taken in much money, Adams said. But
it had hoped to sell advertising on its site and by linking up with
corporations that wanted to offer its service as a benefit for
their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said that Amazon.com had hoped to make the Planet All
address directory available on its site so that people would be
able to look up easily where to send gifts. Originally, Planet All
planned to offer such capability to many on line stores. But Bezos
said that dealings with Amazon.com's competitors would be reduced,
but not eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't let Barnes &AMP; Noble advertise on the Planet All
site,'' he said.
</P>

BEAR CALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Adds author's ID line at end of take.) 
 By JAMES SUROWIECKI 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   How did that old Reagan for President television ad go?
Something like: ``Some people say the bear doesn't exist. . . . But
what if there is a bear?''
</P>
<P>
   The ad was surely better-phrased than that, but it certainly did
come to mind Tuesday as the stock market continued its downward
slide, with the Dow tumbling nearly 300 points and the Nasdaq 65
points, or almost 5 percent. Coming on top of two straight days of
selling and two weeks of incredible volatility, today's sell-off
(which included a dramatic 150-point drop in the last 20 minutes of
trading) seems to have given even the most bullish strategists
second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the bulls scurry for cover has certainly been the most
entertaining part of the past couple of days. (Actually, it's been
the only entertaining part. Even if you think that stocks are
incredibly overvalued, there's something troubling about watching
them fall so far, so fast.) Ralph Acampora of Prudential
Securities, one of the perma-bulls, went on CNBC yesterday and
predicted that the Dow would break 10,000 by year-end, only to
change his mind in the next 12 hours. This morning, Acampora sent a
note to clients suggesting that the Dow could be in for a major
correction, and late this afternoon again went on CNBC and made
what he described as ``a bear call.'' Acampora, who specializes in
that brand of pseudo-science called technical analysis, hedged his
bets, of course, saying that if the Dow ended the day below a
certain point, then it would accelerate lower, while if it didn't,
then it could rally to 10,000. But his call was definitive enough
to spook investors who have been counting on utopian buying to make
up for the exceedingly mediocre performance of corporate earnings
in the last two quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Acampora was very good-natured about everything, and
seemed troubled by the amount of short-term authority that he is
apparently able to wield. But listening to his explanation of why
he had suddenly become bearish, it was hard not to think, ``What's
different here?'' All the factors he cited have been true of the
market for weeks now, and saying that the Dow is going to sell off
because the Dow is selling off doesn't really count as much of a
prophecy.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, the barrage of technical reasons for the
sell-off we were offered today are essentially irrelevant to the
underlying fundamentals that seem at last to be driving this market
downward: the Asian crisis, declining corporate earnings and profit
margins, and slowing growth. And while investors have become
accustomed to buying on the dips, the truth is that the prices of
even already beaten-down stocks are still so high that it's hard to
see them as bargains. In some cases, stocks whose value has been
cut in half are still trading at P/E ratios two or three times the
market's historical average. And undeniably great companies, like
Cisco Systems and Coca-Cola, are trading at prices so high above
their annual growth rates that describing them as cheap in any
sense seems preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows where the market will be heading in the next couple of
weeks? But for too long now bulls have been operating under the
delusion that liquidity was necessarily going to drive this market
higher. There was just too much money in the market for stocks to
drop, we were told. But of course money that flows into the stock
market can just as easily flow out of it, and nothing will
encourage that outward flow like declining equity prices. In the
long run, stock prices will mirror corporate earnings and the
broader interest-rate environment. Interest rates are about where
they've been for the past 3&AMP;frac12; years, but corporate earnings
are now significantly worse than they have been over that period.
It won't be any surprise if stock prices end up significantly worse
as well.

   BOEING-MERGER (Seattle) One year ago, a beaming and confident
Boeing Chairman Phil Condit stepped out of a vintage DC-7 on
display at the Smithsonian's Air &AMP; Space Museum in Washington,
D.C., and, with new President Harry Stonecipher at his side, told
cheering employees about an unstoppable ``new'' Boeing Co. There
were no such celebrations yesterday across the great expanse of The
Boeing Co. to mark the first anniversary of the historic merger.
Top executives declined interview requests. It was not a good year
for Boeing. But even though the promise and expectations of the
merger have been largely overshadowed by Boeing's commercial
aircraft production problems back home in Seattle, industry
analysts say the merger will eventually pay huge reward as Boeing's
defense and space units pull even or ahead of what has been
Boeing's core _ its commercial airplane group.

   TELECOMMUNICATIONS-RURAL (Undated) How soon, if ever, America's
vast rural expanses will join the Information Age is the key issue
in a national policy debate that formally begins this week but
already is prompting sharp debate in the telecommunications
industry. On Thursday, just ahead of a legal deadline, the Federal
Communications Commission will offer proposals aimed at making sure
that everyone in the country has access to the advanced data
networks increasingly important in business, education and health
care. Such networks make good business sense in urban areas, where
the lure of profits is greatest. In rural America, however, where
sparse settlement makes it tougher for businesses to profit, it
isn't clear when the telecommunications revolution will arrive.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: McKeon displays a talent for surviving in the
`interim'
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Well, it had been a good day. Jack McKeon had been
called by the general manager, Jim Bowden, and invited to manage
the Cincinnati Reds another season. Somebody asked him, ``Did you
get a raise?''
</P>
<P>
   ``How is it you guys write it in the papers? `Terms were not
disclosed.'''
</P>
<P>
   John Aloysius McKeon was doing something he enjoys doing.
Puffing on a cigar the size of a log, surrounded, if not by his
nearest and dearest, at least his nearest, Hal McCoy, the Dayton
writer, Jeff Horrigan, the Cincinnati writer, Marty Brennaman, the
broadcaster, Chris Welsh, the pitcher turned telecaster, and others
who would drop in and out at times. These are the media guys
Manager Jack lives with through the season, and road warriors such
as they are as close as members of a circus high-wire act.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon was back in the town that was the seventh stop in his
baseball peregrinations. Fayetteville, Missoula, Appleton, Wilson,
Vancouver, Dallas-Fort Worth were entries in his diary before
landing in Atlanta to manage the Crackers in their last season at
now-extinct Ponce de Leon Park. Minnesota had made the unwise
decision to plant a farm team here. It was disaster. The old park
was home to rats big enough to saddle and ride. The team was a
disaster, worst that ever wore the Crackers uniform, and that dated
back to McKinley's presidency. But here's the puzzling part:
</P>
<P>
   Seven of those players made it to the big leagues, and three had
pretty good careers: Jim Merritt, who became a 20-game winner,
Randy Hundley, the catcher, and Joe Nossek, an outfielder, still
there as a coach.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon was creative. He brought with him a system he had put to
use in previous jobs. He eliminated the long walk and jawing visits
with a struggling pitcher. He talked to him long distance, wired
him and discussed matters with him on a walkie-talkie.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the other managers protested and the league president
cut off my line of communication,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He was way ahead of his time. They still do the death-row march
and time-killing conference on the mound in baseball, but pro
football quarterbacks get their plays by wireless.
</P>
<P>
   There shall be no attempt to cover McKeon's career here. Space
is restricted. Suffice it to say that he has been manager, general
manager, assistant general manager, scouting director, scout,
coach, player, bus driver, interim general manager, everything but
president and owner in baseball. ``And I don't want to be either,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the ``interim'' term that led to the most exciting time
of his baseball life. It was in San Diego in 1980, when the Padres
fired the incumbent and told McKeon he would be general manager
with ``interim'' in front of his title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd look out my window and see guys like Lou Gorman and Cedric
Tallis, all candidates, go by, on the way to be interviewed.
Finally, about August they told me we were doing so well there was
no need to change, so I was it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That led to a pennant and a World Series in 1984, and the top of
the flagpole. Joy supreme. He became an interim again in
Cincinnati, following Ray Knight's exit last year, and now this has
become a steady job. And he's happy in his work. ``I like it when
they want me, but if they don't, it won't hurt my feelings.
Security isn't a concern any more.''
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in New Jersey, found a little college town in North
Carolina, a job there, an education there, and a wife there, and so
today that happy wanderer is a taxpaying resident of Elon College,
the town. He might have broken into, ``Nothing could be finer than
to be in Carolina ...'' but he didn't. I did it for him.

 &HT;    Braves notebook: Chen, Perez move up to Richmond
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Braves consider it a coincidence, but the
organization's two foremost left-handed pitching prospects were
promoted to Class AAA Richmond Monday. Bruce Chen and Odaliz Perez
were ticketed for September call-ups to Atlanta after the major
league rosters are expanded, but Monday's move introduces them as
possible options for the Atlanta bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing big right now,'' said manager Bobby Cox, ``but
there's always a chance to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen, 21, was 12-7, 3.31 at Class AA Greenville but can't join
the Richmond Braves on their current trip to Canada because of an
expired Panamanian passport. He will make one more start with
Greenville, while Perez, only 19, (6-5, 4.02), will immediately
begin working out of the bullpen for Richmond. He had been starting
in Greenville, where his fastball has been timed at 96 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good fit,'' said Deric Ladnier, the Braves'
director of minor league operations. ``I think the timing is right,
and we'll see from there. We never went into the season saying, OK,
August 3, we're going to move these guys to Triple-A. We let them
tell us when they're going to up, which is what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Richmond was short on pitching after right-handed relievers
David Cortes and Mike Porzio were sent to Colorado in last week's
Greg Colbrunn trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves tried unsuccessfully before the trading deadline to
acquire a second left-handed setup man to work with John Rocker.
While Perez and Chen are on the rise a little late, the Braves'
willingness to elevate a flock of relievers at midseason last year
got Kerry Ligtenberg, Kevin Millwood, Mike Cather and Chad Fox (now
with Milwaukee) into the majors. Cox did not reject the possibility
of a similar scenario later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe, maybe,'' the manager said. ``We'll see. Let's see how
they do. I mean, it's a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlton a Brave?
</P>
<P>
   General manager John Schuerholz has been in contact with Norm
Charlton's agent in efforts to sign the 10-year veteran left-handed
reliever, who was released by Baltimore July 28. The Braves are one
of several clubs interested in Charlton, 35, though Atlanta would
sign him only to a minor league contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can sign him and get him to Richmond to work with
(pitching coach) Bill Fischer, if he has anything left in him, we
might be able to get it out,'' said Schuerholz. ``If not, nothing
ventured, nothing gained.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlton was 3-8 with 14 saves and a 7.27 ERA in Seattle last
season before signing with the Orioles as a free agent last winter.
When released, he was 2-1 with a 6.94 ERA and was 0-for-1 on save
conversions. Charlton had allowed 46 hits and 25 walks in 46
innings, but had struck out 41.
</P>
<P>
   Fixing Michael
</P>
<P>
   Michael Tucker began play Tuesday night with his average down to
a season-low .253. He just emerged from his worst month as a Brave
(.180, superseding a .208 August he endured last season), and the
club is committed to letting the right fielder swing his way out of
it. Since July 22, he is 6-for-25, which the team hopes is a
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things do come around every so often,'' Tucker said.
``Everybody has them. Some people are just able to get out of them
a lot faster. Look at (San Diego's) Tony Gwynn. He's never had a
streak where he went 0-for-20, but he did this year. Sometimes it
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker's response to slumps has been extra work, particularly in
the batting cage, and his exhaustive workload has occasionally
worried management. No one on the team takes more swings a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because I'm going through a dry period, am I going to hit
less?'' Tucker asked. ``Or don't hit at all and see what happens? I
didn't do that when I was hitting well (Tucker had a .323 May). Why
should I do it now?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got too good of a swing not to be hitting,'' said Cox.
``He's got pretty good balance at the plate and does a lot of
things great for him not have any success lately. He should hit
.300 standing on his head, for me.''
</P>
<P>
   So has he tried to?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not yet, but we're willing.''

 &HT;    Smoltz wins, also helps cause with 3 hits
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ John Smoltz felt gypped in Cincinnati last week.
Tuesday night, he collected.
</P>
<P>
   Six days after being ejected from just the second game of his
career in a confrontation with a rookie umpire in Cincinnati,
Smoltz beat the same Reds 4-2, picking up his fifth straight
victory, going 3-for-3 at the plate and even scoring Atlanta's
fourth run in the go-ahead seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves won for the 10th time in 13 games and Smoltz improved
to 10-2, giving the Braves five pitchers with double-digit
victories with 30 percent of the schedule still remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Sullivan relieved Reds starter Steve Parris to start the
Atlanta seventh with the game tied 2-2, and Andruw Jones greeted
him by drilling a 1-0 fastball into the left field seats for his
17th homer and second in six career at-bats against Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz followed with his third single of the night (a career
first), and Walt Weiss' single advanced Smoltz to third and chased
Sullivan for left-hander Gabe White. Pinch hitter Tony Graffanino
tapped out to second base to score Smoltz for a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Seanez held the Reds in the eighth and Kerry Ligtenberg
closed them out in the ninth for his 17th save.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds threatened to break the tie in the top of the seventh,
after a one-out single by Aaron Boone and a walk to Chris Stynes.
But Smoltz struck out pinch-hitter Eduardo Perez looking before
ending the inning on a Pat Watkins fly-out to right.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz sailed through the first four innings, yielding only an
infield single before the bottom of the Reds' order caught up to
him in the fifth and erased a 2-0 Braves lead. Willie Greene and
Boone opened the inning with hard singles up the middle, and
Stynes, batting a team-low .176 with runners in scoring position,
drove a double into the left-center gap to score them, though he
was thrown out trying to stretch the hit into a triple.
</P>
<P>
   After an erratic start, Parris grew increasingly effective. He
worked out of trouble in the fourth and fifth with double plays,
and struck out Javy Lopez and Michael Tucker after Ryan Klesko's
one-out double in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves jumped in front 1-0 with two out sequence in the
first inning. After Chipper Jones singled, Andres Galarraga
followed with a broken-bat double off the left-field wall, half his
bat flying into the stands beside the Reds dugout. Jones came
around from first to score, giving Galarraga his first RBI in eight
games.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, Lopez drew a one-out walk in the second and took
third on Michael Tucker's grounder up the middle, his
aggressiveness startling center fielder Watkins into a poor throw.
Lopez scored for a 2-0 lead on Andruw Jones' fielder's choice.

 &HT;    Reds lose to Braves 4-2
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Cincinnati Reds are lodged this week in a
1,671-room hotel with conventioneering hair-cutters.
</P>
<P>
   So, of course, they got trimmed, 4-2, by the Atlanta Braves
Tuesday night in Ted Turner Field _ a little off the top, the sides
shortened.
</P>
<P>
   A modest three-game winning streak went poof because, well, they
aren't playing the Florida Guppies any more.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones broke a 2-2 tie in the seventh inning Tuesday by
crunching relief pitcher Scott Sullivan's second pitch into the
great beyond, his second homer in three pitches in less than a week
against Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves dug quickly into the offerings of starter Steve
Parris, who pitched four hitless innings against the Braves last
Wednesday in Cincinnati before they scored seven runs on eight hits
in the next 1 2/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   This time the Braves extracted a run in the first and a run in
the second off Parris.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs in the first, Chipper Jones singled and circled
the bases on a double by Andres Galarraga.
</P>
<P>
   It became 2-0 in the second after Parris issued a leadoff walk
to Javy Lopez, who took third on Michael Tucker's single and scored
when Andruw Jones hit into a force play.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds drew even against Atlanta's John Smoltz, who was
Parris' opponent last week until he was ejected in the fourth
inning for stepping on umpire Hunter Wendelstedt's foot during an
argument.
</P>
<P>
   This time Smoltz held the Reds scoreless through four, then gave
up two runs on one swing, a two-run double by Chris Stynes that
scored Willie Greene and Aaron Boone.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Reds, Stynes greedily tried to stretch his
double into a triple and was thrown out at third. Parris followed
with a single that might have scored Stynes, then Pat Watkins hit
into a double play, leaving it 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds threatened in the seventh with a one-out single and
stolen base by Aaron Boone and a walk to Stynes. With one out and a
chance to score, manager Jack McKeon took down Parris and sent up
Eduardo Perez to pinch-hit. He struck out and Watkins flied to
right.
</P>
<P>
   Parris left with an excellent line _ six innings, two runs,
eight hits.

 &HT;    At the plate, fear is always there
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Every pitcher has the same best pitch.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a fastball, curve, slider or change.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a knuckler, split-finger, sinker or screwball.
</P>
<P>
   It's fear.
</P>
<P>
   It's every batter's thought _ no matter how deeply hidden _ that
what happened to Craig Counsell can happen to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The right side of Counsell's face was crushed by a pitch from
Houston reliever C.J. Nitkowski during the Marlins' 11-3 victory
Monday night at Pro Player Stadium. Counsell suffered a compound,
displaced fracture of the right mandible.
</P>
<P>
   Marlins team doctor Dan Kanell termed it a ``serious'' trauma
that was, in technical terms, a ``comminuted'' injury. Translation:
approximately an inch-and-a-half of Counsell's mandible was,
according to Kanell, ``shattered'' and ``splintered'' into ``a lot
of pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Counsell underwent oral and plastic surgery early Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   His jaw is wired shut.
</P>
<P>
   He will not eat solid food for five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He is on the 15-day disabled list, but will be allowed to resume
baseball activities in a month. Nobody, however, would be surprised
if the second baseman missed most or all of what remains of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Least of all Florida manager Jim Leyland, who answered the phone
in his office Tuesday afternoon and said, ``Our boy's pretty beat
up, isn't he?''
</P>
<P>
   Fear.
</P>
<P>
   Houston manager Larry Dierker, who won 137 games during his own
Major League pitching career, explained its rawness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The essence of baseball is the pitcher-hitter confrontation,''
Dierker said. ``Everything stems from it, and there's danger.''
</P>
<P>
   That danger is the seed from which fear grows. It is assumed as
part of the game in a process of simplification that allows players
to deal with the demons.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the day-after sympathy for Counsell, which was
expressed in tones of genuine concern, was coated in an
unmistakable coldness.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's Craig Biggio, Counsell's second base counterpart, was
beaned last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's different,'' Biggio said, ``but the bottom line is
you're going to have to get over it if you're going to survive ...
somebody's ready to take your job.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston's Jeff Bagwell, who has had a wrist broken three times
by pitches, expressed much the same sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``As unfortunate as it is, it's part of the game,'' he said.
``You have to put it behind you. If you don't, you have no chance
as a hitter. I was still nervous every time I came back, but I
finally sat myself down and decided it was time to get over it. You
have to forget about it.''
</P>
<P>
   And even Nitkowski, who called the Florida clubhouse after the
Monday night game and tried to check on Counsell's condition
throughout the day Tuesday, eventually was able to review the
situation with a certain objectivity. He admitted to being
``flustered and exhausted'' by the time he reached the hotel after
watching tapes of hitting Counsell, but wanted it resolved in his
own mind by the time he returned to the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In the Houston clubhouse, Nitkowski, a lefthander, demonstrated
the left-handed hitting Counsell's technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look closely, this is his first move,'' said Nitkowski,
dipping his right shoulder down from a batting stance meant to
imitate Counsell's style. ``He fouls a lot of balls off outside. I
thought if I threw a curve out there, he'd hook it to right. I was
trying to throw a fastball inside, but it got up.''
</P>
<P>
   And the unspoken fear became very real in the Monday night rain.
</P>
<P>
   It's always there.
</P>
<P>
   ``In high school, I hit the first kid I faced in the head ,''
Dierker said. ``They had to help him off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Counsell is expected to be released from Holy Cross Hospital in
Fort Lauderdale today, but what Leyland said was ``an awful noise''
will echo for a very long time.
</P>
<P>
   It is baseball's sound of fear.
</P>

Beach, Fla.

 &HT;    Stakes high as a walkout edges closer at BellSouth
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The deadline is less than four days away, the outlook
is somewhat cloudy and the stakes are high.
</P>
<P>
   About 48,000 of the 86,188 workers at BellSouth are represented
by the Communications Workers of America in talks meant to fashion
a contract before the current three-year pact expires Saturday at
11:59 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   A strike would be potentially costly to BellSouth _ and
unprecedented. Previous contract talks were generally uneventful,
producing contracts without fireworks. In fact, workers have not
walked out on BellSouth since the company was created in the 1984
breakup of AT&AMP;T, and BellSouth has promised to keep service humming
should there be a strike this time.
</P>
<P>
   Such a scenario recalls the pre-1984 Bell system, which faced
several strikes in which management was pressed into service as
operators and technicians when workers marched in picket lines.
Calls were connected and directory assistance passed out numbers,
but installation and service calls suffered. And while none of the
strikes shut down the nation's phones, some were prolonged, costly
and bitter.
</P>
<P>
   When BellSouth looks to the past, it generally sees smooth labor
relations and hopes the pattern will assert itself in the current
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to be optimistic that we will have a settlement by
the time these contracts expire,'' said BellSouth spokeswoman
Deborah Spicer.
</P>
<P>
   For BellSouth, a walkout would also be a blow to the image it
has spent millions of dollars to cultivate in many months of
advertisements proclaiming ``nobody knows a neighbor like a
neighbor.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is no feud quite like a neighborhood grudge _ should
neighborly relations go sour. An agreement is apparently blocked
right now by several potentially emotional issues. Most important
could be the question of pensions and health benefits for retired
workers.
</P>
<P>
   That question _ less important in years past _ has moved front
and center with the graying of the company work force. The average
union worker has spent 22 years with BellSouth, and the next three
years will bring thousands of workers to new plateaus of
experience.
</P>
<P>
   A worker with 20 years at BellSouth can retire at age 55, one
with 25 years can retire at age 50 and a 30-year veteran can retire
at any age.
</P>
<P>
   But other sticking points also remain. For example, the union is
unhappy with BellSouth's inclination to find outside, nonunion
workers for some work and critical of current contract provisions
that permit the company to force workers into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The talks involve six contracts for six BellSouth units. Lead
negotiator for BellSouth is Tom Posey, executive director for labor
relations at the company's phone unit. At the other tables are
Michael Matthews, negotiating for BellSouth Communications Systems,
Robert Neil Keith for BellSouth Business Systems, Elizabeth Ruf for
BellSouth Advertising and Publishing, Sylvia Williams for the
company's utility operations and Lin Parker for BellSouth's
corporate headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   On the union side is a parallel team, headed by Jimmy Smith, CWA
vice president for Region Three, which includes BellSouth's
nine-state turf.
</P>
<P>
   The union, naturally, needs to convince its membership that
worker needs are well-defended. But a big union is almost never
eager for a strike against a powerful company, and the CWA knows
such a conflict could be self-destructive as BellSouth increasingly
shifts from an era of virtual monopoly into a time of competition.
Competitors will be aggressive, and most will operate without
unions.
</P>
<P>
   The CWA is hoping to protect what it has while searching for
ways to grow _ and that links the union's health to that of
BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be in a position to make the company the best in
the business,'' Smith said. ``I want them to prosper and grow. I
just want to grow with them.''

 &HT;    Child care comes at cost to working poor
 &HT;    By William Cooper Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH _ While welfare recipients receive free child
care on demand in Palm Beach County, over 1,500 children of the
working poor are on a waiting list, a Children's Services Council
report shows.
</P>
<P>
   There is enough money available for the welfare recipients, but
not for the working poor, who get subsidies for child care based on
their incomes.
</P>
<P>
   The problem likely will get worse after Oct. 1, when Florida's
welfare-to-work program stops giving benefits to welfare recipients
who haven't found jobs. On that date, people who have been on
welfare for two years must find work or face the threat of losing
benefits, under a 1996 state requirement.
</P>
<P>
   For those who find work, the state will only pay for their child
care for another two years.
</P>
<P>
   The fear then is that welfare recipients who have child care
will graduate to the working-poor class, where such luxuries are
scarce. If this happens, it will further strain a local child-care
system that's already having difficulty meeting the needs of poor
families, said Tana Ebbole, the council's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't seen the wave of child care needs that's going to
hit this community,'' said Ebbole, whose agency studied child care
and after-school services in its recently released annual State of
the Child report.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal and state guidelines, a family of four who earns
$24,675 or less is eligible for subsidized child care. According to
the Department of Children and Families, which administers the
money, there are 2,185 local children in the working-poor category
receiving child care, while 1,501 are on a waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   The local DCF office receives $10.2 million to provide child
care for working poor families, which is up from last year's $8.6
million. Even with the increase, there isn't enough money to reduce
the waiting list, said Amelia Lee, a DCF family services specialist
who oversees the program.
</P>
<P>
   DCF has a contract with the county school district, which
distributes money for the working poor to various child care
providers.
</P>
<P>
   For local welfare clients, DCF receives $10.4 million to serve
2,197 children and there is no waiting list, Lee said. DCF
officials are able to serve everyone on welfare because they're
able to borrow unspent money from other districts, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The CSC adds money from local property taxes to the state's pool
for child care. In an effort to close the gap, the CSC this year
added $1.5 million to the $3.5 million it has budgeted for child
care, Ebbole said. CSC also has set aside nearly $1 million to
improve the quality of privately owned child care centers.
</P>
<P>
   The money pays for everything from training to new equipment _
all with the goal of getting more child care centers nationally
accredited, Ebbole said.
</P>
<P>
   K. Lee Tirpak, executive director of Child Care Resource and
Referral in Delray Beach, said the child care dilemma forces some
working-poor families to resort to substandard or even illegal
care. Youngsters are placed in crowded conditions or left with
neighbors who are collecting nominal fees for watching children on
a regular basis, a violation of county and state laws, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some families are taking even greater risks by leaving young
children alone to watch their siblings, Tirpak added.
</P>
<P>
   The council supports bringing together a local coalition of
children's agencies and those who work with the poor to lobby the
state legislature to combine child-care money for welfare
recipients and the working poor.
</P>
<P>
   CSC also began an investment fund to provide a pool of money for
child care for the working poor. CSC is encouraging the private
sector to provide on-site child care or contribute to the pool.
This is with the hope of getting businesses to participate and to
encourage companies to take advantage of available tax credits.

 &HT;    Financial reporting may shift to based on control not stake
 &HT;    By Mickey H. Gramig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The former chairman of the group that sets the
nation's accounting rules says a proposed change in financial
reporting could open a can of worms for Coca-Cola and thousands of
other companies.
</P>
<P>
   At stake are how much profit those companies report and how much
debt is on their books.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis R. Beresford, now on the University of Georgia's
accounting faculty, said all public companies in the United States
would have to consult with their accountants and outside auditors
to see if they would be affected. The Securities and Exchange
Commission could also have a say in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a rule change the Financial Accounting Standards
Board has been considering for about 10 years. Under the FASB's
current rules, consolidated financial statements _ reflecting the
operations of two or more companies _ are required only if one
company owns more than 50 percent of another.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed change, if approved, would make filing such
statements a more subjective decision, based on how much control a
company exerts over another, regardless of the financial stake it
holds.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has gained little attention outside the accounting
world, though an article in Tuesday's New York Times raised
questions about how such a rule change could affect Atlanta-based
Coca-Cola and its largest bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises, also
headquartered here.
</P>
<P>
   In the article, investment analyst Albert Meyer argues Coca-Cola
and CCE are essentially one business, with Coca-Cola in effect
controlling the bottler. Coca-Cola, however, owns only a 44 percent
stake in CCE and therefore, under current rules, is not required to
consolidate the results of CCE's bottling operations in its
financial statements.
</P>
<P>
   If the FASB proposal was approved and if Coca-Cola were found to
have a controlling interest over CCE or any of its other bottlers,
the company would have to factor those operations into its
financial statements, potentially shaving hundreds of millions of
dollars off Coca-Cola's earnings and adding billions of dollars in
CCE debt to its balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are hundreds _ if not thousands _ of companies that
certainly could be affected by this,'' said Beresford, whose
10-year term as chairman of the FASB ended last year
</P>
<P>
   In theory, he said, if a company were the sole general partner
in a limited partnership, it could be required to consolidate the
partnership's operations into its financial statements even if the
limited partners owned 99 percent of the partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why some people would argue that the rule that focuses
on (at least a 50 percent) stock ownership would be more
objective,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such an accounting change also could affect some investment
decisions, ``but accounting changes don't necessarily mean that the
basic underlying principles of the company have changed at all,''
Beresford said.
</P>
<P>
   If Coca-Cola were required to consolidate CCE's operations into
its financial statements, the two companies could still operate
separately, with CCE issuing its own financial reports, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chances of this ever having an effect on Coca-Cola's
earnings statements are probably pretty darn slim,'' Beresford
said.
</P>
<P>
   The FASB began considering the rule change after its 1987
decision upholding the long-held accounting standard that a company
must file consolidated financials if it meets the 50 percent
ownership benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the board issued a draft version of the
proposed rule change, and a revised draft is expected to be
released before year-end. Next would come a public comment period,
typically lasting about four months, followed by a review period,
before FASB votes on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the rule were given fast-track approval, which Beresford
said is unlikely, it wouldn't go into effect until the end of 2001
or 2002.

ADVICE KNOWS NO BOUNDS FOR COUPLES, CADDIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's the guy always at Fred Couples' side on the golf course.
Partly a bodyguard, wholly a friend, a quasi-coach and
psychologist, a consummate caddie.
</P>
<P>
   Joe LaCava has been the man in Couples' corner for the past nine
years. He's logged hundreds of thousands of miles and made hundreds
of thousands of dollars while raking sand traps, reading greens and
handing out clubs at elite courses around the globe. When needed,
LaCava hands out advice, but mostly he just walks along, marks off
yardage and marvels at Couples' talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's still such a thrill _ all these people rooting
for Fred. It's awesome. That's when you realize how fortunate you
are,'' LaCava said. ``Not only is he a great player, but he's a
great person. You look over at other fairways and see some guys
with 10 or 15 people watching them, but with Fred, he's got 10,000
or 15,000 following him around.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not the travel, the adulation or the money that has kept
LaCava alongside Couples since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that still gets me today is the competitiveness and
being in the hunt,'' LaCava said. ``Believe me, I'm the first to
realize that I'm not out there hitting any golf shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you feel like you are in the heat of the battle and that
you are part of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   LaCava, a lifelong Connecticut resident, got started as a caddie
after learning the game of golf in high school. He would spend his
summers carrying the bag of his cousin, Ken Green, who has been on
the PGA Tour since 1982 with moderate success.
</P>
<P>
   LaCava became Green's full-time caddie in 1987 after Green's
sister decided she no longer wanted the job. He worked full-time
for Green until 1989, and then was replaced by Green's brother, who
was going through economic hardship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had three fun years working for Ken and did all right with
him because he was actually playing pretty well at the time,''
LaCava said. ``So I kind of had the fever and wanted to keep
caddying. And the first name that came to mind was Fred
(Couples).''
</P>
<P>
   He talked to Couples in the fall of 1989 and put his name in the
hat as a possible caddie candidate. Couples agreed to try him out
during the four-tournament West Coast swing in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Couples won the 1990 Los Angeles Open with LaCava at his side,
and the two have been a team since. ``Eight and a half years later,
I haven't looked back,'' LaCava said.
</P>
<P>
   Their relationship goes far deeper than handing out clubs and
walking off yardage to the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like Fred relies on me for a lot of information. So
when he does well or does poorly, you still feel like you are part
of it,'' LaCava said. ``Just being in the hunt on Sundays and
having a shot to win is still the biggest thrill of all.''
</P>
<P>
   The money isn't bad, either. Couples takes in well over $1
million a year in winnings. LaCava is hesitant to say exactly what
he makes, but golf sources indicate it's well up in the six-figure
range. ``I won't go into specifics,'' LaCava said, ``but I will say
that Fred takes very good care of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Most caddies receive about 5-6 percent of a player's winnings,
but that can go up to as high as 10 percent when a player wins an
event. Usually, caddies get a standard wage of about $500 for
Thursdays and Fridays, then a percentage of winnings once a player
makes the cut.
</P>
<P>
   LaCava knows his rise to caddie fame and fortune isn't unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did basically what everyone does. I caddied on the weekends
at tournaments to earn a few extra bucks. That's where you learn
the basics, how to tend the pin, how to stay out of everyone's
line, when to say something and when to shut up,'' he said.
``Obviously, it's a different ballgame out on the Tour, but the
basics are still the same.''
</P>
<P>
   What sets him apart is his ability to keep Couples grounded and
in control of his emotions during a round, as well as his keen
knowledge of how to read greens.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get on the Tour, it's knowing the yardage and the
golf course, and then being somewhat of a psychologist out there,
when to say something and when not to say something. That's a big
part of our deal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   LaCava, 34, treasures the life he leads as a caddie, but he
would like to spend more time at home with his wife, Megan, and
1-year-old daughter, Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Megan is very good about it when I'm out on the Tour. She
knows that No. 1, I enjoy what I'm doing very much, and No. 2, that
I make a pretty good living at it,'' he said. ``You take the good
with the bad. The good is that when I'm home, I'm home and I'm off
spending the whole day with my girl.
</P>
<P>
   `` ... I doubt if I will do this the rest of my life, but I'll
keep doing it as long as Fred stays healthy and wants me.''
</P>
<P>
   LaCava is looking forward to coming to Seattle next week to play
the PGA Championship in Couples' hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's obviously looking forward to it and knows he will have a
lot of people pulling for him,'' LaCava said of Couples. ``Every
week there are always a lot of people pulling for him, but in
Seattle, I think 99 percent of the people will be rooting for him.
I can't tell you how good it feels when you are walking down the
fairway and nine out of 10 people in the crowd are yelling for
Fred. I know it's something he feeds off of and truly
appreciates.''
</P>
<P>
   LaCava laughs when asked what advice he might have for kids who
want to learn to caddie on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great that the kids continue to caddie and try to
earn a few extra bucks. But for every (caddie) who's making a
decent living, there are a lot of guys out there who live week to
week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Couples, LaCava will never be one of those.

BOEING'S ROUGH YEAR: LOSS AND PROMISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One year ago, a beaming and confident Boeing Chairman Phil
Condit stepped out of a vintage DC-7 on display at the
Smithsonian's Air &AMP; Space Museum in Washington, D.C., and with new
President Harry Stonecipher at his side told cheering employees
about an unstoppable ``new'' Boeing Co.
</P>
<P>
   The flashy media event to celebrate the $16 billion merger of
Boeing and McDonnell Douglas was broadcast live by satellite to
many of the combined companies' 230,000 employees in 27 states.
Afterwards, Condit and Stonecipher, the former CEO of McDonnell
Douglas, set off on a tour of Boeing facilities where they pressed
the flesh and painted a future as bright as the television lights
that followed them.
</P>
<P>
   There were no celebrations across the great expanse of Boeing to
mark the anniversary. The two top executives declined interview
requests. ``We are not making a big deal of the one-year
anniversary, either inside or outside of the company,'' said Boeing
spokesman Larry McCracken. ``We are concentrating on continuing to
make the company run smoothly, strengthening programs, attacking
costs and increasing efficiencies _ none of which are keyed to a
12-month schedule or artificial one-year-later milestone.''
</P>
<P>
   It has not been a good year for Boeing since the merger. On Day
One a year ago, Boeing's stock was flying high at $58 7/16 a share
after a recent split. Tuesday, it closed at $36~. The company
posted its first operating loss in a half century last year. And
even though the commercial production difficulties are improving,
they are not over.
</P>
<P>
   But even though the promise and expectations of the merger have
been largely overshadowed by Boeing's commercial aircraft
production problems back home in Seattle, industry analysts say the
merger will eventually pay huge rewards as Boeing's defense and
space units pull even or ahead of what has been Boeing's core _
designing, building and selling commercial airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This merger truly makes Boeing the premier aerospace and
defense company in the world,'' said Peter Jacobs, aerospace
analyst with Ragen MacKenzie Inc. in Seattle. ``These production
problems that have occurred over the last 12 months certainly
impact the company in the short term. But once past, the true
strength of Boeing's business will become readily apparent.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, although the commercial side has dominated the
headlines, this was really a merger about defense and space.
</P>
<P>
   What the merger principally gave Boeing was diversification,
meaning the company is less likely to be hurt by the mercurial
nature of the commercial airplane business. That diversification
comes from defense and space side of the company, which Boeing
executives want to eventually contribute 50 percent of total annual
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Currently commercial is top dog with about 60 percent. But
defense and space is gaining. In 1993, Boeing's defense and space
units accounted for only 18 percent of the company's annual sales.
Of Boeing's total sales of $25.5 billion in 1993, defense and space
was responsible for only $4.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, defense and space accounted for $18.1 billion of
Boeing's total sales of $45 billion, about 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By 2002, Boeing expects its defense and space work to contribute
about $25 billion in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Heymann, an analyst with Prudential Securities, said he is
convinced that Boeing's military and space business will eventually
exceed the company's own expectations and account for about 60
percent of total company sales.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that future growth will come from the commercial space
business, which is booming. Boeing is well positioned in this
market with the Delta rocket program it inherited from McDonnell
Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   It also is the principal partner in a project known as Sea
Launch, which later this year will begin launching satellites for
commercial customers from a converted oil rig in the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commercial space has the highest, long-term substantial growth
of any business that Boeing is involved in,'' Heymann said. ``There
is the potential for upwards of 20 percent growth annually.''
</P>
<P>
   The Delta II has for many years been a mainstay of the
commercial and military satellite business. And the Delta family is
growing. Boeing is preparing to launch later this month at Cape
Canaveral its first Delta III, which is more powerful and can carry
heavier payloads. And on the drawing boards is Delta IV, which is
supposed to reduce today's launch costs by more than 25 percent
when it is becomes operational in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we have yet to really see the benefits, Boeing has
certainly become a major power in space as a result of the addition
of McDonnell Douglas and Rockwell,'' said defense analyst Paul
Nisbet, aerospace analyst with JSA Research.
</P>
<P>
   To improve operating efficiencies, Boeing has been streamlining
its space and defense operations throughout the company, and
shifting more work to outside contractors. It is also consolidating
facilities by more than 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Profit margins for defense and space are about 7.6 percent,
according to Boeing's most recent second-quarter earnings report.
They are expected to remain below 8 percent this year and below 9
percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   That's much better than the 2 percent to 4 percent margins
Boeing expects to make on its commercial business next year. But it
is substantially less than the double-digit profit margins enjoyed
by the defense and space business of McDonnell Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has said it will eventually earn profit margins of 13
percent from its defense and space units, but analysts say that is
unlikely because there was little overlapping of programs as a
result of the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boeing was just adding new programs,'' said Nisbet. ``There's
not a lot of room for savings when you do that. The savings will be
more on the commercial side.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing moved quickly this past year to cut away the unprofitable
commercial aircraft operations of McDonnell Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   After examining the books of its formal rival, Boeing decided to
phase out over the next year or so production of three McDonnell
Douglas commercial jets _ the MD-80 and MD-90 twinjets and the
MD-11 widebody trijet. The three planes are manufactured in Long
Beach, Calif., along with the MD-95. Boeing will continue
production of the 100-seat MD-95, which was renamed the 717. The
first flight is scheduled for early September.
</P>
<P>
   Although Boeing has stated publicly it believes there is a
substantial market for the 717, the only significant firm order _
for 50 planes with options for 50 more _ was from launch customer
ValuJet back in 1995. Analysts say if Boeing does not land new
orders soon for the 717, that plane may meet the same fate as the
other McDonnell Douglas jets.
</P>
<P>
   Halting production of the three MD aircraft lines in Long Beach
cost Boeing more than $1.4 billion in pre-tax writeoffs that
contributed to the company's dismal post-merger financial
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing knew going into the merger, however, it might have to
make those kinds of tough financial decisions. Boeing wanted
McDonnell Douglas anyway because it makes advanced fighters such as
the F-18 Super Hornet and the Delta rockets that carry commercial
and military satellites into space.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts say there was a down side to the acquisition
of McDonnell Douglas: The merger may have indirectly contributed to
Boeing's production problems getting so far out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   Once the merger was announced in late 1996, it took more than
seven months to get it approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``One wonders if bringing that merger together diverted some of
top management's attention from the commercial operations, which
continued to worsen during 1997,'' said Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst, who asked not to be quoted by name, put it more
bluntly.
</P>
<P>
   He said Condit was not able to focus his attention on what
needed to be done on the commercial side because he was working
with Stonecipher to get the merger approved.
</P>
<P>
   Condit's management style is to walk the factory floor, talking
with workers, this analyst noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``One can't blame the production problems on the merger, but one
could also say that Phil's management style of being close to the
workers and spending a great deal of time on the factory floor
would have allowed him to notice the problems earlier and take
action.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This would not have been as bad as it got had Phil's attention
not been diverted to closing the McDonnell Douglas merger,'' the
analyst said.

 &HT;    NEARING THE END, THE NINETIES STILL SEARCHING FOR IDENTITY
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (l) lifestyle categories for
release Saturday, Aug. 8.
 &HT;    By SAMAR ABULHASSAN
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Let's take a stroll through the graveyard of
decades.
</P>
<P>
   There's the gaudy 1920s marker, with its epitaph of ``Roaring.''
Keep on marching past the ``swinging'' '60s headstone and the
human-shaped ``Me Decade'' of the '70s. The monstrous tombstone for
the '80s can't be missed _ it denotes the ``Greed Decade.''
</P>
<P>
   But now is a particularly grave time in pop culture land. Just
17 months shy of 2000, there's no consensus among trend trackers,
pop culture mavens and futurists on a catch phrase for the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   The '70s in Reverse? The '80s With a Conscience?
</P>
<P>
   With the millennium clock ticking, those are just two of the
desperate efforts to tag the decade. A poll last month by the
Toronto Star yielded 640 responses. The adjective most often chosen
to describe the '90s was ``nasty.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gilded Age it's not, but has this decade been that bad?
</P>
<P>
   ``The '90s are going to be pretty much forgotten,'' says Gerald
Celente, president and founder of the Trends Research Institute.
``There's not one identifiable sound, style or emotion that puts a
handle on these times.''
</P>
<P>
   Celente said future generations would remember the ``Gray '90s''
as a dark age, defined by corrosive cynicism and a deep distrust in
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never before have people lost faith in so many institutions
simultaneously,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, says pop culture expert Shelton Waldrep, an assistant
professor of English at Georgia State University. He says the '90s
have brought a ``raising of consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are asking some very important questions,'' Waldrep
says. ``We're entering the 21st century with a healthy amount of
suspicion about projecting the future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a decade that can be characterized by millennial anxiety,
and anxiety breeds a kind of good artistic work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a wired society, that work is being shared by all, some
experts think.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doors to culture have been opened to all of us _ in music,
art and television,'' says Ray Browne, professor emeritus at
Bowling Green State University in Ohio, where he founded the
nation's first popular culture studies program in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   He calls the '90s the ``Popular Culture Decade,'' one in which
elite culture has become replaced by one that is accessible to the
everyday person.
</P>
<P>
   But like others, he concedes that its difficult to pinpoint the
essence of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two or three currents running in different
directions,'' he says. ``This nation is in peace, we're robust and
very confident. At the same time, we're not sure of ourselves
spiritually, and our standards our down.''
</P>
<P>
   Author Faith Popcorn, who tracks social, economic and political
trends on lifestyles and buying habits, thinks the opposite is
true. She calls the decade the ``'80s with a Conscience.'' People
are now more spiritual, conservative and less apt to spend
exuberant amounts of money, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Dinerstein, a fellow in American Studies at the University
of Texas in Austin, has a few ideas about what to call the '90s. On
the one hand, he says, its about defining what's ``cool'' in the
search for a vernacular culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're searching for people whose lives and iconhood have stood
the test of time,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest themes the '90s had to offer were the prevalence of
the information superhighway and basketball, Dinerstein says. He
pointed to Michael Jordan, the Womens' National Basketball
Association and the expansion of basketball worldwide. The sport
has become a global commodity, he says, which has translated into
new ways to think about business and life.

   WASHINGTON _ Let's take a stroll through the graveyard of
decades.
</P>
<P>
   There's the gaudy 1920s marker, with its epitaph of ``Roaring.''
Keep on marching past the ``swinging'' '60s headstone and the
human-shaped ``Me Decade'' of the '70s. The monstrous tombstone for
the '80s can't be missed _ it denotes the ``Greed Decade.''
</P>
<P>
   But now is a particularly grave time in pop culture land. Just
17 months shy of 2000, there's no consensus among trend trackers,
pop culture mavens and futurists on a catch phrase for the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   The '70s in Reverse? The '80s With a Conscience?
</P>
<P>
   With the millennium clock ticking, those are just two of the
desperate efforts to tag the decade. A poll last month by the
Toronto Star yielded 640 responses. The adjective most often chosen
to describe the '90s was ``nasty.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gilded Age it's not, but has this decade been that bad?
</P>
<P>
   ``The '90s are going to be pretty much forgotten,'' says Gerald
Celente, president and founder of the Trends Research Institute.
``There's not one identifiable sound, style or emotion that puts a
handle on these times.''
</P>
<P>
   Celente said future generations would remember the ``Gray '90s''
as a dark age, defined by corrosive cynicism and a deep distrust in
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never before have people lost faith in so many institutions
simultaneously,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, says pop culture expert Shelton Waldrep, an assistant
professor of English at Georgia State University. He says the '90s
have brought a ``raising of consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are asking some very important questions,'' Waldrep
says. ``We're entering the 21st century with a healthy amount of
suspicion about projecting the future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a decade that can be characterized by millennial anxiety,
and anxiety breeds a kind of good artistic work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a wired society, that work is being shared by all, some
experts think.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doors to culture have been opened to all of us _ in music,
art and television,'' says Ray Browne, professor emeritus at
Bowling Green State University in Ohio, where he founded the
nation's first popular culture studies program in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   He calls the '90s the ``Popular Culture Decade,'' one in which
elite culture has become replaced by one that is accessible to the
everyday person.
</P>
<P>
   But like others, he concedes that its difficult to pinpoint the
essence of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two or three currents running in different
directions,'' he says. ``This nation is in peace, we're robust and
very confident. At the same time, we're not sure of ourselves
spiritually, and our standards our down.''
</P>
<P>
   Author Faith Popcorn, who tracks social, economic and political
trends on lifestyles and buying habits, thinks the opposite is
true. She calls the decade the ``'80s with a Conscience.'' People
are now more spiritual, conservative and less apt to spend
exuberant amounts of money, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Dinerstein, a fellow in American Studies at the University
of Texas in Austin, has a few ideas about what to call the '90s. On
the one hand, he says, its about defining what's ``cool'' in the
search for a vernacular culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're searching for people whose lives and iconhood have stood
the test of time,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest themes the '90s had to offer were the prevalence of
the information superhighway and basketball, Dinerstein says. He
pointed to Michael Jordan, the Womens' National Basketball
Association and the expansion of basketball worldwide. The sport
has become a global commodity, he says, which has translated into
new ways to think about business and life.

 &HT;    Bankston wants to be his own player, not replacement for 'Big
Daddy'
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GEORGETOWN, Ky. _ His signing triggered the offseason trade of
Dan ``Big Daddy'' Wilkinson to the Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Now can former Arizona Cardinals' star Michael Bankston make
everybody in Cincinnati forget about Big Daddy?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not my intention,'' the 6-foot-5, 285-pound left
defensive end said. ``I'm not going to try to compensate in some
manner for another player. I'm just here to do a job.''
</P>
<P>
   That job is to elevate the defense _ ranked 28th among the NFL's
30 teams in 1997 _ and carry the Bengals to their first playoff
berth since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   To get there, the Bengals can't afford another slow start. They
are a combined 9-47 the first half of the last seven seasons and
36-76 overall in that span.
</P>
<P>
   With 13-year veteran Clyde Simmons at right end, a swift
linebacker corps and an improved secondary, Bankston _ a seven-year
pro from Sam Houston State _ believes the defense is playoff
material.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toward the end of the last two seasons, they've come on
strong,'' Bankston said about the Bengals' 7-2 and 4-1 finishes in
1996-97. ``What we're looking for is a jump start at the beginning,
then just building as the season goes along.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some guys that will push the pocket back. We've just
got to continue to learn how to finish, so we can get to the
quarterback, and fine tune ourselves so when we get ready to roll
in the regular season, everybody is on cue and we can start winning
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Take away last season's quarterback sacks _ Wilkinson had five
to Bankston's two _ and Bankston's numbers overshadow Wilkinson.
</P>
<P>
   Bankston led Arizona in tackles with 114 (including 66 solos) in
'97 _ the Cardinals used a four-man front _ while Wilkinson had
only 34 stops (24 solos) as the Bengals' right end in the first
year of coordinator Dick LeBeau's 3-4 defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself a good run stopper,'' Bankston said. ``I'm
more of a 'read' caliber of player _ a guy who does what it takes
to get the job done. With me reading, I can get (in position to
make tackles) a little quicker and I know what's going on across
the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gonna hit somebody. That's just in my nature. I just can't
see myself walking to a play. I run to the play.''
</P>
<P>
   Although linebackers generate most of the sacks in the 3-4
defense, Bankston wants his share of the booty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a hard worker. It's just that sacks don't come to me as
easy as they do for some people,'' he said. ``My mindset is: 'Watch
out for everybody else and try to keep the quarterback in the
pocket.'
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, I'm limiting myself getting to the
quarterback. I want to change that mindset coming to this team to
where I can just go after the quarterback. I'm a coachable person
and I'm willing to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Head coach Bruce Coslet hopes Bankston can do for the Bengals
what he accomplished for Arizona while playing alongside Eric
Swann.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bankston's a tremendous football player,'' Coslet said. ``He
made all the tackles, but Swann got all the publicity. I'm not
looking for any more production from him. He already produces.''

 &HT;    Ohio governor supports insurance companies' 'quick appeals
process'
 &HT;    By Debra Jasper
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Ohio Gov. George Voinovich tells a story about his
daughter-in-law, Dina, whose insurance company refused to pay for
medical tests needed to find out why she was having headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich said his son, George, ``raised hell'' with the
insurance company, which finally agreed to pay for the tests _
perhaps in part, the governor said, because of the Voinovich name _
and it turned out that Dina needed brain surgery. Today, she's
doing fine, Voinovich said, ``but what if they had denied her
that?''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking after a meeting at the National Governors' Association
here, Voinovich said states must make sure insurance companies
offer their patients a ``quick appeals process'' so problems with
denied coverage can be resolved immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican governor, who served this year as chairman of the
NGA, also talked about other priorities for governors, saying the
NGA must continue to make sure the federal government gives states
more power to handle welfare reform and other key issues on their
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``My contention is we care about the people in our states as
much as the president and Congress,'' Voinovich said. ``Not only do
we care about them, we have a better idea of how to help the people
in our states. We're closer to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich said there has been a shift of power back to the
states in part because of NGA influence. He said the NGA should
keep lobbying the federal government to stop passing new laws
without giving states the money to pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   Under his direction, Voinovich said the NGA has used its clout
to convince Congress to make favorable changes, but huge challenges
remain, especially as states cope with rapidly changing technology.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, if sales over the Internet are not taxed
then states will be forced to look for other revenue and ``could
end up having to come to Washington for more money.'' He said
Washington was able to take power from states to begin with because
local governments ``didn't have the courage to raise revenues to
take care of local problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich and other governors on Tuesday, the fourth and last
day of the convention, heard from Henry Kissinger, former Secretary
of State and winner of the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize. Kissinger told
them states must learn how to deal with the new economic world
order. ``We can not separate ourselves from the rest of the
world,'' Kissinger said. ``It is not a debate between isolationism
and interventionism. It is a reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich also spoke during the convention about the Clinton
scandal, saying it will eventually affect Clinton's effectiveness.
``The character thing makes a difference,'' Voinovich said.
</P>
<P>
   Delaware Gov. Tom Carper, who will serve as the new chairman of
the NGA, praised Voinovich's leadership of the NGA in 1997 and
1998. Carper said he once talked with Ohioans about why Voinovich
was so popular and was told, ``He's a straight shooter. He's a
decent guy. His word is his bond.''
</P>
<P>
   After working with him, Carper said he knows Voinovich is
committed to doing things well. And most important, Carper said,
``He doesn't give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich, who is running against Democrat Mary Boyle for a U.S.
Senate seat this year, said he will miss his fellow governors, and
the opportunities he has had in the NGA as governor of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he wins a senate seat, he said, ``the down side is you
don't have the direct impact one has a governor. Quite frankly, you
don't have the personal connections.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, for example, at a meeting about Head Start, there
``wasn't a dry eye in the place,'' and he walked out of there ``on
a cloud. . . . I felt like a million bucks. I don't think as a
senator you will have that kind of feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich said when he left the Cleveland mayor's job he had
many friends and ``boom, you never see them again. It will be the
same thing with this outfit.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Voinovich said, if he is elected senator he
will have the opportunity to focus on a few issues and ``bird dog
them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he has spent a good deal of his life lobbying Congress,
and now, ``I want to get inside.''

 &HT;    Gailey brings his values into the undisciplined world of the
Cowboys
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ To find the most outlandish display of
Dallas Cowboys fan ardor in this remote NFL outpost, head north on
Route 281, away from the team's new summer training camp at steamy
Midwestern State University.
</P>
<P>
   Past the sprawling Big Oak Ranch, where skinny cattle regard
even a single shoot of grass as a feast. Beyond dusty fields of
corn and cotton and soybean ravaged by four weeks of 105-degree
temperatures. By gleaming fighter jets at Sheppard Air Force Base
and the rusting oil derricks that once pumped wealth into the area.
To within spitting distance of the Oklahoma border.
</P>
<P>
   And there, across a stretch of scorched earth that shimmers in
the mid-day heat, rises the 60-foot water tower up which a creative
and daring Cowboys zealot recently ventured to spray-paint a blue
star, that familiar logo of the league's highest-profile franchise,
along with one word and an exclamation point: ``Boys!''
</P>
<P>
   Chan Gailey has yet to visit the makeshift shrine. The Cowboys'
rookie head coach has been far too occupied with the reclamation
project he has undertaken on a team that finished a dismal 6-10
last year and missed the playoffs for the first time since 1990.
Too bad, because Gailey, 46, has a well-documented affinity for
rural water towers.
</P>
<P>
   As a curious 3-year-old eager for big-picture perspective,
Gailey scaredhis parents by shimmying halfway up the water tower on
Lee Street in Baxley, Ga. Forty-three years after Tom Gailey had to
tote his suddenly frightened son to safety,Chan Gailey still heeds
the important lesson he learned that day. He knows that the best
way to reach for the stars is to keep your feet on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``That whole water-tower story has gotten blown out of
proportion,'' Gailey said before an afternoon practice last week.
``I've gotten a lot smarter in my old age. I don't do dangerous
stuff like that anymore. Older and wiser, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   Some people may question his wisdom, after watching the steady
deterioration of the Cowboys in 1997 under the undisciplined Barry
Switzer. Gailey's sagacity. He Gailey is only the fourth head coach
in franchise history but the third since Jerry Jones bought the
club in 1989; the impetuous owner doesn't cotton to delayed
gratification and third-place finishes in the NFC East.
</P>
<P>
   The defense should remain solid, though it lacks depth in
critical areas. But special teams, which ranked fourth last season,
might not be able to withstand the annual free-agency defections.
And the offense, 20th last year, still revolves around quarterback
Troy Aikman, wide receiver Michael Irvin and running back Emmitt
Smith. The trio averages 30.7 years of age and nine seasons of
experience. The entire unit is one of the oldest in the NFL, at an
average of 29.8 years and 6.7 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the contradiction of Gailey, a low-key man known
for his Christian values, as the leader of an outfit rarely far
from the glare of the spotlight or the ignominy of the police
blotter. Gailey recently said that the person he would most like to
meet is Jesus and that if he were president his first move would be
to allow public prayer in schools.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey taught Sunday school in Americus, Ga., is very active in
the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and delivered the homily at a
Dallas-area church on Mother's Day this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're talking temperament and attitude,'' defensive tackle
Chad Hennings said, ``he's the anti-Switzer.''
</P>
<P>
   `Big-time gamble'
</P>
<P>
   The problems and contradiction aside, Gailey insists that he
will make the situation work _ even though his only pro head
coaching experience was with the Birmingham Fire of the World
League. That confidence, Gailey acknowledged, is mostly
attributable to his rearing in Americus, where his mentors included
his high school coach, Jimmy Hightower, and Dan Reeves, who coached
him in Little League.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you grow up in a small town in Georgia,'' Gailey said
about his youth, ``you're either in school, playing sports or in
church.''
</P>
<P>
   Hightower reinforced the disciplined approach Gailey first
learned from his father, a high school coach, dean of students,
businessman, district councilman and mayor who died a year ago from
prostate cancer. Reeves gave Gailey his first break, hiring him in
1985 to coach Denver's special teams.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Gailey's coaching resume hardly augured a career
in the NFL. Gailey still says Reeves took a ``big-time gamble''
hiring him in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I knew the kind of person Chan was, and, when our scouts
came in off the road, his name always came up as a young college
guy doing a great job,'' Reeves said. ``Everyone told me about how
hard he was working with that program at Troy.''
</P>
<P>
   Son of the South
</P>
<P>
   In Gailey's mind, he was only perpetuating a blue-collar work
ethic that was a part of the Americus experience _ one handed down,
in part, by Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a unique town, a small town, but they wouldn't let you
just grow up like a country hick,'' Gailey said. ``You had to have
a little class. The older folks expected it from you, and so did
the kids who preceded you in the high school. They wanted you to be
able to present yourself well. The competitiveness there was
amazing. ... You asked for no advantages, and you certainly gave
none. You either whipped somebody or you got whipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great little town with a winning spirit and winning
attitude. It was a terrific place to grow up. I'm proud it's a part
of what I am. It seems if you're from Americus, you take a little
piece of that place with you no matter where you go.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey was the least-known of a list of Cowboys candidates
during Jones' 34-day search. Few in the cotton- and peanut-farming
area around Americus, however, were surprised that one of the
town's most celebrated prep stars would ascend to his current
status.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figured there wasn't anything that Chan couldn't do,'' said
Virginia Davis, a former neighbor. ``He was always focused enough,
and I guess resourceful enough, to get where he was headed sooner
or later. In most cases, Chan knew what he wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Many times, he didn't have to venture far to find it.
Twenty-five years ago, he married the former Laurie Johnson, who
lived down the street from him in Americus and whose father worked
for years with Tom Gailey in the furniture business. The couple has
two sons, Tate, a junior at Auburn, and Andrew, who will attend
Elon College.
</P>
<P>
   A former high school basketball player and solid athlete, Laurie
Gailey is every bit as competitive as her husband and often
questions his playcalling. ``I keep him honest,'' she told a
Dallas-area newspaper this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, she hasn't had to. A well-fixed moral compass,
stability on the home front and basic survival instincts honed as
an Eagle Scout always have served Gailey well.
</P>
<P>
   A big heart and strong mind
</P>
<P>
   During a round of golf, a 15-year-old Gailey spotted a
groundskeeper slumped over in a creekbed, bleeding from a snake
bite. He took off his shirt, tied a tourniquet around the worker's
arm, then tossed him into a cart and accompanied him to the
clubhouse. ``And when Chan got home, he apologized for getting
blood on his shirt,'' remembered his mother, Mrs. Helen Maddox.
When he was the coach at Troy State in 1984, Gailey's team won the
Division II national championship. Because of the school's limited
athletic budget, Troy officials could not afford to buy diamond
rings for the entire roster. The squad voted to accept less
expensive rings so all the players would get one. Gailey quietly
ordered the diamond rings for the seniors, who suffered through two
losing campaigns before his arrival, and personally handled the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Jones sought an offensive-oriented coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's what we needed on and off the field,'' Jones said. ``I'm
thrilled with what I have witnessed first-hand so far. We're paying
attention to the detail-type things we had allowed to slip around
here. On offense, it's a big departure ... but maybe part of our
problem was that we were simply too predictable.''
</P>
<P>
   An inveterate offensive tinkerer, Gailey can quickly fill a
chalkboard with X's and O's and figures to be anything but staid.
At Troy State, he ran the wishbone and Gailey has been exposed to
everything from the veer to a wide-open set with four or five wide
receivers. ``He gauges all his personnel and then adjusts,'' said
Ken Hatfield, for whom Gailey worked at the Air Force Academy.
</P>
<P>
   A players coach
</P>
<P>
   The new Cowboys playbook is heavy into spreading the field with
four wideouts, much as Gailey did in Pittsburgh. The shotgun has
been installed to buy time for quarterback Troy Aikman, and wide
receiver Michael Irvin has lined up all over the place, including
the backfield, as Gailey attempts to make it harder for defenses to
find him.
</P>
<P>
   For all his scheming, Gailey is not manipulative by nature. The
only strategic move in his coaching career, Gailey said, was
leaving the Broncos in '91 to become the head coach of the
Birmingham Fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was at a point where I really decided, after years of not
caring, that I wanted to be a head coach,'' Gailey said. ``I saw
how Lindy (Infante) and Jim (Mora) had gotten to the NFL by working
in the USFL first, and (I) thought the World League might provide
me the same opportunity. Two years into it, I thought it was the
craziest move I ever made. Five years after, it had become the best
move. But there was a lot of skepticism in between.''
</P>
<P>
   There remained some skepticism in The Gailey Way among players
after Friday night's 20-19 defeat in the preseason opener, but
players respect the fact he allows their input and seeks their
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past,'' Irvin said, ``you'd maybe hold back instead of
going to a coach and saying, `You know, maybe if we do it this
way.' But he kind of encourages us to let him know our opinion on
things. He wants us to be involved.''
</P>
<P>
   That's probably because Gailey, a quarterback with only modest
arm strength, became a real student of the game under Hightower.
</P>
<P>
   At Florida, where he mostly held a clipboard and had to teach
himself to deep-snap to earn playing time, Gailey studied the game
plans as much, if not more, than the starting quarterback. His
coach, Doug Dickey, said Gailey sometimes made suggestions about
the structure of some plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``He watched everything,'' said Dickey, now the athletics
director at Tennessee. ``He was a real football sponge _ a
perfectionist, really.''
</P>
<P>
   `Do everything the right way'
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Gailey's motto, ``Do everything the right way,'' has
been repeated to the Dallas players in every team meeting this
camp. The five words are plastered on nearly every door in training
camp, confronting the players as they leave the locker room, walk
into the dining hall and retire to their dorms. Gailey's father,
whom he called ``a disciplined man but not necessarily a
disciplinarian,'' drove home the point early on to his son, and
Chan has practiced the adage and passed it on. Mike Turk, his
quarterback at Troy State and now an assistant coach there, has the
same sign above his desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up in Americus, you just naturally did things the
right way,'' Gailey said. ``You weren't allowed to do it any way
but the right way. If you stepped out of line, you got smacked. So
to avoid getting smacked, you stayed in line. Everyone there was
watching you to make sure you didn't slack off.''
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, things haven't changed much for Gailey. He will
come under heavy scrutiny. ``He's as much on the spot as the
players here, and he knows it,'' linebacker Dexter Coakley said.
``Everyone is waiting for him to screw up, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey appears to be unaffected by the pressure. On the practice
field, it is difficult to pick him out from the trainers. He rarely
raises his voice but does make even the most veteran players run
penalty laps for a blown assignment. The odds might slim he can
resurrect the Cowboys and restore them to powerhouse status, but
Gailey will rely on the equalizer he knows best _ hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think, growing up in Americus, that you ever felt the
playing field wasn't even just because you came from a small
town,'' he said. ``Probably I was just naive enough to believe that
if you tried hard you could do anything you set out to do.

 &HT;    Ellis signed to bolster injury-depleted corners
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Injuries are part of pro football, but it's not always
the injured player who gets victimized. Former Valdosta State
defensive end Schad Freeman learned that Tuesday when the Atlanta
Falcons waived him in order to sign cornerback Kwame Ellis to a
one-year, $198,000 contract to remain at the 80-man roster limit.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-10, 188-pound Ellis played for Scotland of the World
League this spring after splitting his rookie season of 1996
between the Jets and Vikings. Minnesota cut him last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis was signed because of nagging injuries to starting right
cornerback Ronnie Bradford and reserve Randy Fuller. Fuller has
missed 11 straight practices with an ankle sprain and Bradford has
missed 10 with a hamstring strain. Also, rookie Elijah Williams has
been slowed by ankle sprains.
</P>
<P>
   Eight cornerbacks are competing for five or six jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thin at that spot, and felt like he was a guy who could
come in and at least compete,'' coach Dan Reeves said. ``We
couldn't afford not to bring one in. We have questions about Ronnie
and Randy as far as when they'll be back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are about $1.9 million under the cap, and since
Ellis got no signing bonus, his contract does not affect that
unless he makes the team.
</P>
<P>
   That will be tough. Starting left corner Ray Buchanan, Bradford,
Michael Booker and reserve Juran Bolden figure to make it.
</P>
<P>
   Fuller, a four-year veteran who played the last three seasons
with Pittsburgh, Williams, Ellis, and Lenny McGill, who spent the
past two seasons in Atlanta, are the others.
</P>
<P>
   The injuries could impact each player differently. Booker has
been working in Bradford's starting spot. In Fuller's case, a
roster spot could be at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you miss time it's detrimental to you as a team, and
to the guys competing,'' Reeves said. ``There's not a lot they can
do about it, (but) I've never used an injury as a threat (to cut
someone).''

PAPA BEAR'S NEW BOOK SEES A COMING TIME OF DEFLATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States has not had falling prices since the 1930s.
But last year inflation was at 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Could the price level actually fall, and continue falling for
several years? Most economists don't think so. One who does is Gary
Shilling, author of ``Deflation,'' a new book by Lakeview Press.
</P>
<P>
   Shilling, 61, has been sorting the tea leaves since the 1960s.
As a young economist for Merrill Lynch, he made a name for himself
by predicting the 1969 recession. It also got him fired. He held
court at White, Weld &AMP; Co. until his bearishness caught up with
him. In 1978 he decided that the only job security was working for
himself, and he founded A. Gary Shilling &AMP; Co. Based in
Springfield, N.J., he continues to forecast for corporate clients
and write a column for Forbes, usually defending the bears' turf.
</P>
<P>
   Bears, it is said, don't make money. Maybe, but they sometimes
are right. In 1983, Shilling and a collaborator, Kiril Sokoloff,
published a book entitled, ``Is Inflation Ending? Are You Ready?''
Back then, no staff economist would have put his name on a book
asking whether inflation was ending. Shilling's forecast was
outlandish _ and close to the mark.
</P>
<P>
   Shilling argues today that prices will begin falling because of
a confluence of powerful forces:
</P>
<P>
   _Peace, and the plunge in military spending since 1989;
</P>
<P>
   _Competition, made tough by the strength of the U.S. dollar and
the ``Asian flu'' abroad, and by deregulation at home;
</P>
<P>
   _Financial conservatism, which includes the balanced federal
budget and a new emphasis on personal savings; and
</P>
<P>
   _Technology. The natural direction of technology prices is down,
Shilling says, ``whether it's computers and the Internet today or
farm equipment 100 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Peace is the least appreciated and most important on the list.
``We've been in a wartime stance in terms of inflation-deflation
since the late 1930s,'' he says. ``But if you go back before that,
deflation is the norm in peacetime _ and this is the first real
peacetime we've had'' since then.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s, consumer prices fell by about 1 percent per year,
as radios, cars and electric lights became cheaper. The federal
government ran surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   The comparison, however, is not exact. Clinton's surplus is
barely a crumb next to Calvin Coolidge's. And all the talk about
Americans' new interest in saving money has not shown up in the
national income statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they're the wrong statistics. The Federal Reserve says
American household assets have increased by $12.5 trillion since
the end of 1994. Americans haven't needed to save more; they have
been making too much in the stock market. They will start saving,
Shilling argues, when the next bear market begins clawing away
these gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a 15-year bull market,'' he says. ``The vast
majority of investors, and an even bigger percentage of brokers,
have never seen a bear market. I think you've got a major
correction coming.'' (So he said last week. Prescient guy.)
</P>
<P>
   Shilling argues that the U.S. economy has not yet felt the full
brunt of the collapse in Asia. ``We haven't yet seen the surge in
imports at lower prices,'' he says. ``It takes time for them to
re-orient production and get their financing in order.'' But they
will, he says, and prices will fall.
</P>
<P>
   OK, some prices. But most prices? Can deflation exist in a world
of paper money?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Shilling says. Look at Japan. Wholesale prices have been
falling for six years. Look at Switzerland: four years. The same
can happen here.
</P>
<P>
   Deflation, even a small amount, can change behavior. When most
products are falling in price, consumers have an incentive to save.
Prices of heavily leveraged assets like real estate fall. Interest
rates fall, and credit standards tighten.
</P>
<P>
   In a world of falling prices, he says, technology companies
``have a huge advantage, because what we're forecasting is nothing
new to them.'' (Shilling's son Geoff, 33, is a product manager at
Microsoft.)
</P>
<P>
   Shilling does not expect a deep deflation. In the next economic
upcycle he expects a ``good deflation,'' something like the 1920s
or the years 1876-1896, in which prices fell an average of 1.7
percent per year.
</P>
<P>
   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is still focusing on inflation. In
testimony to Congress July 21, Greenspan used the words
``inflation'' and ``inflationary'' 38 times, ``deflation'' not
once, and concluded that the risks of inflation ``remain
significant.''
</P>
<P>
   He may be right. If I had to bet, I'd still put my nickels on
Greenspan. It' hard to bet against the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Shilling chuckles. Greenspan ``is fighting the last war.''
</P>
<P>
   With inflation ticking along at only 1.7 percent, Greenspan is
still right. We are still in an era of inflation. But just barely.

 &HT;    Easy-to-love early version of `Romeo'
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm not exactly sure who the target audience might be, but
Abrams has published a very attractive retelling of Romeo and
Juliet ($18.95), with some stunning illustrations by Margaret
Early, done in the manner of the Book of Hours, complete with
gorgeous decorative borders.
</P>
<P>
   People who are serious about the story probably want
Shakespeare, while a young person enraptured by the Leonardo
DiCaprio version won't really appreciate the quality of the art.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, Abrams is to be congratulated for commissioning
Early, whose work makes this a book to treasure.
</P>
<P>
   One reason I'm not
</P>
<P>
   a book publisher ...
</P>
<P>
   There was probably no better-reviewed book of 1997 than James
Salter's memoir Burning the Days. Everyone was enraptured by the
beauty of Salter's prose, not to mention the story of his life. The
book was even granted the privilege of an excerpt in Vanity Fair.
</P>
<P>
   In the annual autopsy of last year's publishing results,
Publisher's Weekly reports that Random House gave the book a first
printing of a very modest 15,000 copies, and the book ended up
selling about 25,000 copies _ by the limited standards of literary
publishing, a modest success.
</P>
<P>
   This is just one example of the bipolar nature of modern
publishing, which increasingly mimics the movie business, in which
a sale of 100,000 copies for schlock thrillers is regarded as a
failure, while anything with a patina of quality is on life-support
at 15,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky Lindy . . .
</P>
<P>
   A. Scott Berg's authorized biography of Charles Lindbergh will
be published this fall by Putnam and has already been chosen by the
Literary Guild, who which paid $235,000, the highest they've it's
ever gone for nonfiction. Film rights have been sold to Steven
Spielberg (Paging Tom Hanks?)
</P>
<P>
   This will only be Berg's third book _ the previous ones were
biographies of Sam Goldwyn and Maxwell Perkins. He takes close to
10 years to do a book, but they're invariably worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Nevermore ...
</P>
<P>
   HarperFlamingo will be publishing Wooroloo, the first collection
of poetry by Frieda Hughes, the daughter of Sylvia Plath and Ted
Hughes. Hughes is a painter and author of children's books who
lives in Australia, hence the title.
</P>
<P>
   Author Alert!
</P>
<P>
   At 7:30 p.m. on Thursday, August 6, at the Borders at 525 N.
Congress Ave. in Boynton Beach, Dr. Laurence Miller will be signing
copies of his new book about surviving trauma and tragedy, Shocks
to the System.

 &HT;    Tearful `Herald' publisher tells staff he's leaving
 &HT;    By Michael Utley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ David Lawrence Jr., the career
newspaperman who flirted briefly earlier this year with running for
governor, said Tuesday he will resign as publisher and chairman of
The Miami Herald Publishing Co.
</P>
<P>
   He will be replaced by Alberto Ibarguen, publisher of the
Spanish-language El Nuevo Herald and vice president of
international operations for The Miami Herald.
</P>
<P>
   A tearful Lawrence, 56, announced his departure during a meeting
of several hundred employees in the cafeteria of The Herald's
headquarters in downtown Miami and was showered with a 45-second
standing ovation, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``I frankly yearn for the opportunity to decide what I want to
do with my life,'' he told employees. ``It may be in journalism,
but it won't be as publisher.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence, publisher of The Herald since 1989, said he will
remain as the company's chairman through the end of 1998. Beyond
that, he said, his plans are less clear.
</P>
<P>
   In a one-page letter sent to employees and the media, Lawrence
said he made the decision to quit on July 27 and handed his
resignation to Frank McComas, a senior vice president at Knight
Ridder Inc., owner of The Herald and 30 other daily newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Knight Ridder Chairman and Chief Executive Tony Ridder said in a
statement Tuesday that Lawrence's resignation was ``disappointing''
and ``unwelcome news.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridder said he urged Lawrence to stay, but ``Nonetheless, I
respect Dave's decision and I know that he agonized over this a
long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence's departure comes at a time when The Herald, Florida's
largest newspaper, is under intense pressure to improve its
financial performance.
</P>
<P>
   Under Lawrence's leadership, the paper won four Pulitzer prizes
_ including one for its coverage of Hurricane Andrew in 1992 _ but
it also has been one of Knight Ridder's poorest advertising
performers and its circulation declined last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Herald had a daily circulation of 365,000 in 1997, according
to the latest Audit Bureau of Circulation figures, down from
430,000 in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Three months ago, Knight Ridder announced plans to move its
corporate headquarters from Miami to California's Silicon Valley,
where the company owns the San Jose Mercury-News.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Lawrence denied that the move was a slight against
The Herald and Miami in general, but it was widely interpreted that
way.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Lawrence seemed to hint at the effect of these
pressures.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can never be a business of halfway efforts,'' he wrote.
``You must run hard all the time. I cannot remember when I did
anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was that hard-charging attitude that inspired
Lawrence's odd and short-lived gubernatorial bid. He withdrew his
name in April after drawing heavy criticism. A columnist at his own
newspaper called him ``Publisher Loco'' and asked, ``Dave, have you
completely lost your marbles?''
</P>
<P>
   Many political observers said he had little name recognition and
almost no chance of winning. After suffering such public
humiliation, Lawrence, who couldn't be reached for comment Tuesday,
said he woke up one morning at 4:18 and decided, ``You must be
hungry to run for governor. . . . I am not that hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence became publisher of the Herald in 1989, after serving
as publisher and executive editor of the Detroit Free Press. He was
named editor of The Charlotte (N.C.)Observer at age 33, after
moving through the editing ranks at The Washington Post , the St.
Petersburg Times, The Palm Beach Post and The Philadelphia Daily
News.
</P>
<P>
   During Lawrence's tenure as managing editor of The Palm Beach
Post from 1968 to 1971, the paper won a Pulitzer Prize. The award
went to photographer Dallas Kinney for a photo essay on the plight
of migrant farm workers.
</P>
<P>
   Ibarguen, Lawrence's replacement, at The Herald, has been
publisher of El Nuevo Herald, the Spanish-language daily newspaper
published by The Herald, since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining the newspaper, the Puerto Rican-born Ibarguen,
54, was executive vice president of operations at Newsday and New
York Newsday and formerly was senior vice president of finance and
administration at The Hartford (Conn.) Courant.
</P>
<P>
   `I frankly yearn for the opportunity to decide what I want to do
with my life. It may be in journalism, but it won't be as
publisher.'

   In his letter, Lawrence seemed to hint at the effect of these
pressures.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can never be a business of halfway efforts,'' he wrote.
``You must run hard all the time. I cannot remember when I did
anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was that hard-charging attitude that inspired
Lawrence's odd and short-lived gubernatorial bid. He withdrew his
name in April after drawing heavy criticism. A columnist at his own
newspaper called him ``Publisher Loco'' and asked, ``Dave, have you
completely lost your marbles?''
</P>
<P>
   Many political observers said he had little name recognition and
almost no chance of winning. After suffering such public
humiliation, Lawrence, who couldn't be reached for comment Tuesday,
said he woke up one morning at 4:18 and decided, ``You must be
hungry to run for governor. . . . I am not that hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence became publisher of the Herald in 1989, after serving
as publisher and executive editor of the Detroit Free Press. He was
named editor of The Charlotte (N.C.)Observer at age 33, after
moving through the editing ranks at The Washington Post , the St.
Petersburg Times, The Palm Beach Post and The Philadelphia Daily
News.
</P>
<P>
   During Lawrence's tenure as managing editor of The Palm Beach
Post from 1968 to 1971, the paper won a Pulitzer Prize. The award
went to photographer Dallas Kinney for a photo essay on the plight
of migrant farm workers.
</P>
<P>
   Ibarguen, Lawrence's replacement, at The Herald, has been
publisher of El Nuevo Herald, the Spanish-language daily newspaper
published by The Herald, since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining the newspaper, the Puerto Rican-born Ibarguen,
54, was executive vice president of operations at Newsday and New
York Newsday and formerly was senior vice president of finance and
administration at The Hartford (Conn.) Courant.

 &HT;    The sweet life at the ice cream factory
 &HT;    Has sidebars: HOMEMADE-ICE-CREAM, ICE-CREAM-TIPS
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Kids in a candy store have nothing on
adults in an ice cream factory.
</P>
<P>
   If you own that factory, well, it's like a birthday party every
day, with as much ice cream as you want, anytime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have so much fun here. We both love ice cream so much _ I
guess that's why we're in the business,'' said Jody Luke, half the
duo at Luke's Ice Cream in West Palm Beach. Her partner and
husband, Kevin, can't help grinning in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   There's extra excitement on a recent day: A new flavor, Denali's
Moose Tracks, is coming off the line. Luke's was tapped to be the
exclusive distributor of the flavor in South Florida. It's already
a hit in the Midwest, where it was created by Dean Foods Company.
</P>
<P>
   The ice cream, a vanilla base studded with miniature peanut
butter cups and laced with ribbons of thick fudge, is pumped into a
sample quart cup.
</P>
<P>
   The Lukes dig their spoons into a quart container. ``Ooooh. This
is great!'' Jody said. ``I love the fudge _ it's really thick and
creamy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I could eat that whole thing,'' Jody admits.
</P>
<P>
   She works off those ice cream calories with a long schedule. The
couple spends up to 18 hours a day at their wholesale-only plant on
Georgia Avenue, turning out 3-gallon tubs of premium ice cream.
It's sold to ice cream parlors, hospitals and schools, hotels,
country clubs and amusement parks. Luke's is one of a few small,
local ice cream makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got the Kennedy Space Center,'' Jody said. They'll
have an exclusive contract to provide all the center's ice cream.
``I can't tell you anything about it yet. We're still developing
their product.'' A special flavor is likely, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Luke's is not available retail _ you can't get any at the
factory, but you can taste it at dozens of places that have ice
cream. Chances are, if you've eaten ice cream at SunFest or in a
country club, it's Luke's. Mar-a-Lago serves it. Same with many
local ice cream parlors, including Sprinkles in Palm Beach, the
Lukes' first customer.
</P>
<P>
   You won't find it in grocery stores, however. ``It's too hard to
compete with the big guys for shelf space,'' Kevin said. ``We want
to concentrate on our custom product, and maybe later we'll get
into gourmet stores and convenience stores, or a Costco or Sam's.
But that's in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   They got their start with 3 gallons, produced in 1987 in the
back of Kevin's restaurant (Luke's) on Lake Worth Road.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was unhappy with the ice cream he was getting for the
restaurant, so we decided to make our own. It was delicious, and
through word of mouth, we started making it after hours for chefs
and selling it out the back door,'' Jody said.
</P>
<P>
   They closed the restaurant in 1989 to make ice cream full time.
</P>
<P>
   Their custom-made flavors, such as Bailey's Irish Cream, or
ginger-pear ice cream, are what set them apart from Edy's or Ben &AMP;
Jerry's. ``We can do as few as 6 gallons of one flavor,'' Kevin
said. ``So if a chef wants something special, we can do it, whereas
they'd laugh at you at Edy's. They're not set up to handle small
orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just did a champagne and rose petal sorbet for a wedding at
a country club. It was delicious,'' he said. Another recent oddity
was a black-pepper ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good _ you had that burst of flavor after the ice cream
melted on your tongue,'' Kevin said. A green tea made for an Asian
chef didn't go over so well with the traditionalists, however.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the ice cream and sorbets, and a line of fat-free and
sugarless ice cream, they also make a few frozen desserts _
cheesecakes, mousse cakes and ice-cream pies. It's all from
scratch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't use any ice cream mixes _ we make our own from the
solids,'' Kevin said. ``Most big companies start with a mix. We
used a mix till about three years ago.'' Making their own mix gives
them control over the quality.
</P>
<P>
   The process is surprisingly simple, only three steps, and not
unlike the same steps a home cook might use.
</P>
<P>
   First, the liquid mix or base is made by combining milk powder,
sweetener, butterfat solids and water. Luke's goes through 15,000
pounds of butterfat a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We produce what is considered a premium ice cream. It's about
16 percent butterfat, the same as Ben &AMP; Jerry's,'' Kevin said. The
higher the butterfat content, the more creamy and rich tasting it
is.
</P>
<P>
   The mix is homogenized and pasteurized (heated to 180 degrees),
then held 12 hours at 42 degrees to age.
</P>
<P>
   Then the mix is pumped to the packing room, where it is combined
with the flavorings, sent through the freezing churn and pumped
out. The finished product comes out like a soft-serve ice cream
into 3-gallon tubs, ready for flash-freezing at -25 degrees. Fans
create a wind chill factor in the freezer of -60 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ice cream will have a core temperature of -10 degrees
within two hours,'' Kevin said. Workers wearing heavy hooded parkas
and gloves hurry in and out with the ice cream. The factory employs
12 people.
</P>
<P>
   In the packing room, workers are busy smoothing the ice cream
into tubs and weighing them.
</P>
<P>
   A weight fluctuation means too much or not enough air may be
going into the ice cream. Air is added to ice cream for texture _
most commercial ice creams have 100 percent air. That, in the
industry's parlance, means if you melted down a gallon of ice
cream, it will measure only half a gallon. Luke's, like other
premium ice creams, is only about 60 to 65 percent air.
</P>
<P>
   Certain flavors get hand-packed. Extra-thick ingredients that
would be crushed or mashed by the hopper are added by a worker,
using a huge rubber spatula. In the summer, Luke's produces up to
1,200 gallons of ice cream a day.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, Bordeaux (wine) soaked cherries were being stirred
into a rich vanilla base. The ice cream is layered with the
cherries, and stirred very little in between.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want them mixed together. We tried that, and the
ice cream came out red from the cherry juice. We told them it was
vanilla ice cream with cherries, but they wouldn't buy that. People
are really funny,'' Kevin said.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the mint chip ice cream is green, he said. ``We have
to add green food coloring. They wouldn't buy it when it was white.
Mint flavoring has no color _ it's clear. But they wouldn't buy
white mint ice cream _ they only wanted it if it was green, even
though its taste was identical.''
</P>
<P>
   He admits his own peculiarities, however _ he loves the mix of
ice cream when the machines are being switched from vanilla to
chocolate. There's that moment when the ``combination is just
right. I run right in with my cup and stick it under the pump. You
don't have to call me twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Jody has her cup ready when they're making cookies and cream.
</P>
<P>
   That's the big draw in working at Luke's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We eat as much as we want, and we encourage the employees to
take as much home as they want. We love it, so we figure they do,
too,'' Jody said.
</P>
<P>
   Are they invited to a lot of parties? ``You hit the nail on the
head in a big way,'' Jody said.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin laughed. ``Between our family and friends, we're the most
popular guests to have at a party. We always get volunteered to
bring dessert.''
</P>
<P>
   THE SCOOP ON LUKE'S ICE CREAM
</P>
<P>
   THEY USE 4,000 pounds of sugar and 3,000 pounds of butterfat
weekly.
</P>
<P>
   THEY PRODUCE up to 1,200 gallons of ice cream a day in the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   LUKE'S HAS A CORE of 40 flavors that make up 80 percent of its
business. Vanilla is the biggest seller by far. Cookies and cream
runs a close second, then chocolate and butter pecan.
</P>
<P>
   NEW FLAVOR: Denali's Moose Tracks, vanilla ice cream with mini
peanut butter cups and fudge.
</P>
<P>
   SOME CUSTOM-MADE FLAVORS: Champagne and rose petal sorbet; black
pepper ice cream; green tea ice cream.

 &HT;    By Staffwriters
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUYING FROM LOCAL COMPANIES means your ice cream likely is
fresher than the grocery-store variety.
</P>
<P>
   PREMIUM ICE CREAM has a higher butterfat content. Luke's premium
has 16 percent, roughly the same as Ben &AMP; Jerry's.
</P>
<P>
   TO AVOID ICE CRYSTALS on ice cream, try to keep it at the
correct low temperature as much as possible. Taking it out of the
freezer and putting it back in gives the crystals a chance to form.
</P>
<P>
   USE ICE CREAM WITHIN TWO WEEKS if possible. Ice cream can be
stored up to six months if kept at freezing or below. If not
totally sealed, however, it will pick up freezer flavors. Pints or
quarts are better than half-gallons, since they are used faster.

 &HT;    Homemade ice cream helps beat the heat
 &HT;    Sidebar to ICE-CREAM-FACTORY
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   So all this talk of ice cream has you wondering where you put
your home ice-cream maker.
</P>
<P>
   Dig it out _ here are recipes for making a few special blends.
They are from the book ``Sorbets and Ice Creams and Other Frozen
Confections'' by Lou Siebert Pappas (1997 Chronicle Books, $14.95).
</P>
<P>
   (Note: Refer to your ice-cream freezer's manual for basic
instructions.)
</P>
<P>
   Vanilla bean ice cream
</P>
<P>
   1 4-inch vanilla bean, halved lengthwise
</P>
<P>
   2 cups half-and-half
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   6 egg yolks, beaten
</P>
<P>
   1 cup heavy (whipping) cream
</P>
<P>
   Scrape the black seeds from the vanilla bean into a
double-boiler. Add vanilla pods and half-and-half, and cook over
barely simmering water until scalded. Whisk the sugar into the egg
yolks. Whisk in some of the hot half-and-half, return this mixture
to the pan and cook over barely simmering water, stirring
constantly, until custard coats the spoon. Immediately place the
pan in a pan of cold water and stir to cool to room temperature.
Stir in the cream.
</P>
<P>
   Cover and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled _ about 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   When you are ready to freeze the mixture, remove the vanilla
pods. Freeze according to your ice-cream freezer's directions.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 1 quart.
</P>
<P>
   Coffee-bean ice cream with bittersweet fudge sauce
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons coffee beans, or 3 tablespoons freeze-dried coffee
granules
</P>
<P>
   2 cups half-and-half
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   6 egg yolks, beaten
</P>
<P>
   1 cup heavy (whipping) cream
</P>
<P>
   For the fudge sauce:
</P>
<P>
   6 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup half-and-half
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup light corn syrup
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   In a double boiler, combine the coffee beans and half-and-half.
Heat over barely simmering water for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the
coffee flavor is pronounced to your liking. Whisk the sugar into
the egg yolks. Whisk in some of the hot half-and-half mixture,
return this mixture to the pan, and cook over barely simmering
water, stirring constantly, until the custard coats the spoon.
Immediately place the pan in a pan of cold water and stir to cool
to room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Strain the custard base into a container and discard the beans.
Stir in the cream. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours or until
thoroughly chilled. Freeze in an ice-cream maker according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
</P>
<P>
   To make fudge sauce: Combine the chocolate pieces, half-and-half
and corn syrup in the double boiler. Cook over barely simmering
water, stirring until the mixture is smooth. Stir in vanilla. Serve
warm in a pitcher and pour over the ice cream at the table.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 1 quart.
</P>
<P>
   Coconut ice cream
</P>

   1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   In a blender or food processor, blend the coconut until finely
shredded. In a double boiler, combine the coconut and coconut milk,
and heat over barely simmering water for 15 minutes. Whisk the
sugar into the egg yolks. Whisk in some of the hot coconut milk
mixture, return this mixture to the pan and cook over barely
simmering water, stirring constantly until the custard coats the
spoon. Immediately place the pan in a pan of cold water and stir to
cool to room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Stir the cream and vanilla into the mixture. Cover and
refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours, or until thoroughly chilled. Freeze
in an ice-cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 1 quart.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons honey or to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 cup plain yogurt
</P>
<P>
   In a food processor or blender, combine all ingredients and
puree. Freeze in an ice-cream maker according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
</P>
<P>
   To make without a freezer: Pour mixture into an 8- or 9-inch
square metal pan or a half-gallon plastic container. Cover with
aluminum foil, plastic wrap or a lid, and freeze until firm, about
3 hours. Transfer to an electric mixer or food processor, and beat
or process until light and fluffy. Transfer to a container, cover
and freeze until firm, from 1 to 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Makes about 1 quart.

 &HT;    Marine's Vietnam metals stolen by Florida teens
 &HT;    By Susannah A. Nesmith
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ Willard D. Roy is glad he wasn't home
Sunday night, August 2, when four teenagers broke into his home and
stole medals he earned in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really angry at first,'' Roy said. ``I'm really glad I
didn't catch them because I'd probably be in jail now and there'd
probably be some parents out there that'd be real upset because of
what I might have done to their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Police Cmdr. Chuck Johnson, a Vietnam veteran himself,
sympathizes with Roy. He's working with the Rotary Club to get
replacement medals for Roy, who served in the Marine Corps from
1967 to 1969.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of have a soft spot for Vietnam vets,'' Johnson said.
``He was in the Marines and I was in the Army. We were over there
at the same time. I think of what he went through over there.
Getting his medals back is the least we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Police have interviewed two of the teens and identified two
others, Johnson said. Some of Roy's property, his compact disk
player, a hand-held television and a small pellet gun, were
recovered at the home of one of the teenagers, who are all between
12 and 15.
</P>
<P>
   Roy is a little embarrassed by all the attention his war medals
have garnered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want people coming up treating me like a hero or a
victim,'' he said. ``I just want to live my life.''
</P>
<P>
   And he kind of blames himself for the burglary. The teens got
into his house through an awning window that didn't close all the
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it is probably my own fault because I didn't make the
window so it wouldn't do that,'' he said. ``I'd asked my landlord
but he never did anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   A machinist working in Palm Beach Gardens, Roy has lived in Port
St. Lucie for about a year. He moved here from Okeechobee.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is not sure the department will be able to find the
medals, though officials are still looking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my gut feeling that the kids ditched the medals because
they didn't have any value to them,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Though he appreciates Johnson's efforts to get replacement
medals, Roy said the originals were priceless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather have my own back,'' he said. ``I really wanted them
to pass on to my kid.''

 &HT;    Sick driver gets lots of stares, one helping hand
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Let's say you are driving down the road,
and you come upon a little traffic jam. Some woman's car is
blocking the intersection. People are beeping their horns and
wagging their fingers and having to go around her. Nothing major,
but it's making a general mess of things.
</P>
<P>
   Now, let's say you look over, because you're curious as to what
the heck is going on, and you see her sitting behind the wheel.
She's older. Poor lady, you think, and you imagine that her car has
stalled out and then you go on your merry way. You've got an errand
to run.
</P>
<P>
   You stop at the Radio Shack near the corner of Congress Avenue
and Boynton Beach Boulevard to get the batteries for your headset,
the one you use in your home office, and you keep thinking about
that little old woman. She was just sitting there, all alone,
straight as a ramrod, as though she was afraid to breathe, as
though she was afraid to move. You spend about 20 minutes in the
store because the Radio Shack guy can't find the right batteries,
they're weird things with a strange little prong, and when you're
done, you walk outside into the heat.
</P>
<P>
   And you stop and think.
</P>
<P>
   Home's one way, and the old lady in the car is another. You
should just go ahead on home. You're a busy person with a business
to run. You've got things to do. You're sure that lady's fine. But
there was something about the way she was sitting in that car.
There was something about the way everyone was just zooming all
around her.
</P>
<P>
   You get in your car and drive to the intersection.
</P>
<P>
   You pull up and _ my God _ she's still sitting there, not a soul
inside the car to help her. In fact, help does not seem to exist in
anyone's vocabulary. Drivers are still beeping, still pulling
around her every which way. They're wagging their fingers and
rolling their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   And she's still inside, ramrod straight.
</P>
<P>
   You park at a gas station, a Shell station, you think. Should we
call 911? you holler to the guy, and the two of you decide, yes,
hurry. And you walk to the car, in front of all the people who are
too busy, or too afraid, to stop, depending on the excuse of the
day, and you get your first good look at the poor thing.
</P>
<P>
   She's thrown up but she's still sitting with her head high. You
figure she's too nauseated to move. And you ask her: Are you OK?
She shakes her head no.
</P>
<P>
   And then you see that, God love her, the car's still in gear.
All this time, 20 minutes at least, and she's been sitting at this
intersection, sick as a damn dog, with her foot on the brake.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, this is what gets to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is wrong with this world?'' you think. ``Where is our
humanness?''
</P>
<P>
   The rescue folks come, and they take the woman to the hospital.
You find out a day later she's going to be fine. A little problem
with her heart, nothing too awfully serious. But that night, you
can't get to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   You can't stop thinking of that poor woman sitting there, sick
and smelly, her foot firmly planted on that brake pedal. You can't
stop thinking about everyone zooming all around her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It scared me,'' says Deborah Alexander, 44, the woman who
stopped to help a stranger last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This moved me to the point that I know I'll never forget it.''

   A call for truth
</P>
<P>
   By Rowland Nethaway
</P>
<P>
   c: 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ From behind the ramparts within the bunkered White
House, President Clinton vows to never surrender.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has told the truth about this and he will
continue to do so,'' said a White House spokesman in response to
calls by Capital Hill Democrats and Republicans for Clinton to come
clean with the American people.
</P>
<P>
   Loyal Democrats Dick Gephardt and Barney Frank have joined
congressional Republicans in calling on Clinton to defuse the
six-month-old Monica Lewinsky investigation by telling the full
truth.
</P>
<P>
   Former Clinton advisers George Stephanopoulos, Leon Panetta, Dee
Dee Myers and David Gergen also have urged their former boss to
tell the truth about his relationship with the former White House
intern and his sworn testimony that he did not have sex with the
young woman.
</P>
<P>
   However this sorry mess plays out, history will record the time
when everyone in the nation's capital joined hands, turned their
faces toward 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and in perfect harmony called
on the president of the United States to tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   A chorus of diverse people calling for the truth. It could be a
Coca-Cola commercial.
</P>
<P>
   This is historic because it means Democrats and Republicans
alike presume Clinton has been lying under oath and directly to the
American people.
</P>
<P>
   Only the inner-circle of Clinton's shadow government still
defends the president's truthfulness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a little insulting to turn on the television and see
people come up with the brilliant idea that he should tell the
truth,'' an anonymous Clinton loyalist told The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton insiders say the president has told the truth in
previous testimony under oath and will tell the truth when he
testifies under oath Aug. 17 about whether he committed felonious
perjury, obstructed justice or urged others to give perjured
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is what any truthful person would do. But
Clinton's legal defense team is demanding the DNA test results of
the stain on Lewinsky's blue trophy dress before the president
gives his Aug. 17 testimony under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has a pathological blind spot when it comes to the
truth. When Gephardt, Stephanopoulos, Panetta and others urge
Clinton to tell the truth, they are thinking of ``the truth'' in
the manner it was used when Jesus said, ``And ye shall know the
truth, and the truth shall make you free.''
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, there is no such thing as ``the'' truth. Clinton
gives self-serving versions of the truth based on how much he
thinks he can get away with.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is on tape coaching Gennifer Flowers to lie. ``They
don't have pictures,'' he says. ``If no one says anything, they
don't have anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Aug. 17 testimony is an attempt to determine if he
lied under oath in testimony in Paula Jones' sexual harassment
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewinsky scandal fell under the scope of independent counsel
Kenneth Starr's Whitewater investigation because Attorney General
Janet Reno felt the criminal behavior alleged in the Lewinsky
affair fit a pattern of criminal allegations that could be traced
back to the beginning of the Whitewater investigation.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge federal panel agreed with Reno. This pattern of
alleged criminal behavior has resulted in the indictments and
convictions of any number of Clinton's close friends and associates
going back to 1978 when the Clintons got into a sweetheart land
deal with James B. and Susan McDougal, who were convicted and sent
to prison.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's bunker mates may feel it's a little insulting for so
many people to ask Clinton to tell the truth, but it's more
insulting for Americans to feel the need to plead with their
president to tell the truth.

RURAL AMERICA AWAITS LINK TO INFORMATION AGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WARREN WILSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   How soon America's vast rural expanses will join the Information
Age is the key issue in a national policy debate that formally
begins this week but already is prompting sharp dispute in the
telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, just ahead of a legal deadline, the Federal
Communications Commission will offer proposals aimed at making sure
that everyone in the country has access to the advanced data
networks, which are increasingly important in business, education
and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Such networks make good business sense in urban areas, where the
lure of profits is greatest. There, many companies already are
offering customers fast Internet access, sophisticated services and
lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   In rural America, however, where sparse settlement makes it
tougher for businesses to profit, it isn't clear when the
telecommunications revolution will arrive.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are partly economic. For example, if data networks
are confined to cities, rural areas find themselves largely cut off
from the electronic-commerce boom already beginning to occur.
</P>
<P>
   But the consequences could go far beyond business. As the
Internet becomes more important in education, rural students risk
falling behind.
</P>
<P>
   As the health care system relies more on data networks to link
far-flung experts, rural doctors risk being unable to get the same
kind of information as quickly as those in cities. The issue is
coming to a head because the FCC, under the Telecommunications
Reform Act of 1996, must conduct a six-month study to find out
whether advanced telecommunications networks are reaching ``all
Americans in a reasonable and timely fashion,'' and if not, to take
``immediate action'' to make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   Participants and regulators all agree that the stakes are high.
But they disagree sharply over the best way to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   The regional Bell telephone companies, including US West, which
provide the vast majority of local service, say they're willing to
build expensive data networks to serve rural areas. But they want
permission from the FCC to carry data across boundaries where now
they must hand it off to a long-distance company.
</P>
<P>
   And they also want their data networks exempted from rules
saying they must lease network facilities to competitors at a
discount.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors claim they want to serve rural areas, but their
current plans bypass huge chunks of rural territory, US West says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who stand to suffer the most, unfortunately, are
rural Americans,'' US West Vice President Mark Roellig said when a
U.S. Commerce Department agency opposed the Bell companies'
requests.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors such as MCI, WinStar, NextLink and Covad
Communications shoot back by saying their network plans have been
thwarted by the Bell companies' great reluctance to give up their
long-held monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   MCI has been among the most vocal. The Bell companies are trying
to ``hoodwink'' regulators by promising data networks in exchange
for a ``list of goodies,'' Jim Lewis, MCI's senior vice president
for public policy, said last week. If the FCC gives the Bells what
they're seeking, Lewis said, it will effectively end market-opening
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Besides denying their petitions, he said, regulators should
force the Bells to quit stalling and open up their local networks
to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   U S West counters that it is seeking exemptions only for data
networks, not for those that carry voice traffic. The competitors
argue that the reform law draws no distinction between voice and
data.
</P>
<P>
   ``The act stands for the proposition that networks are networks,
regardless of the services provided over them,'' Steven Chrust,
vice chairman of wireless provider WinStar, told the FCC at a
hearing last month.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is fast erasing the distinction between voice and
data.
</P>
<P>
   Voice traffic typically travels on circuits that are dedicated
or reserved for the duration of the call, even if neither party is
speaking.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, however, it is being broken into tiny digital
``packets'' that travel on circuits shared by many users, just as
business reports, stock figures and e-mail are sent. Packets are a
much more efficient use of network capacity.
</P>
<P>
   As the Bell companies develop packet networks, they ``will not
abandon their circuit-switched networks,'' Chrust told the
commission. ``They will merge their existing networks with the data
networks.''
</P>
<P>
   Granting their petitions, he warned, will subvert the benefits
that occur when all services will be deliverable on the same
network.
</P>
<P>
   FCC commissioners have indicated they oppose the two main parts
of the Bell companies' petitions. Chairman William Kennard has gone
a step further, telling utility regulators last week in Seattle
that he can envision local telephone companies setting up
subsidiaries to build data networks that would be ``free of much of
the regulation that is still necessary in the case of the parent
company.''
</P>
<P>
   In theory, such subsidiaries would compete for data-network
business on the same footing as companies such as MCI, giving the
FCC a way to monitor whether the Bells were treating all players
equally.
</P>
<P>
   ``On paper . . . that sounds terrific. But in reality, it just
doesn't work that way,'' Steve Hooper of NextLink Communications
warned the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the playing field were level, Kennard's proposal might
not adequately address the basic problem that rural areas are more
expensive to serve than cities. ``Competition will not serve all
areas equally,'' a government telecommunications analyst said.
``What is going to be needed, probably, are subsidy programs of
some fashion. And that, of course, is the dirty little secret that
no one wants to talk about.''

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A on the news
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the Los Angeles Police Department still investigating the
murders of Nicole Simpson Brown and Ron Goldman?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. As long ago as October 1995, police and prosecutors went
on record as saying they had no plans or obligation to reclassify
the Brentwood murders as an open case. ``It's closed,'' said Lt.
John Dunkin of the Los Angeles Police Department. ``It's not an
unsolved case.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials remain convinced that the evidence
proved Simpson guilty of the murders, despite his acquittal. ``I
think that everybody in the business knows who did it,'' prosecutor
Mike Carroll told the Los Angeles Times. ``If a man on the street
has some lingering doubts, that doesn't make us change the official
records or opinion about something.''
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Gil Garcetti responded similarly when asked if
the murder investigation would be reopened.
</P>
<P>
   Q: President Clinton has declared the New River, in North
Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia, one of several American
Heritage Rivers. What are the others?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Blackstone and Woonasquatucket rivers, in Massachusetts
and Rhode Island; the Connecticut, in Connecticut, Vermont, New
Hampshire and Massachusetts; the Cuyahoga, in Ohio; the Detroit, in
Michigan; the Hanalei, in Hawaii; the Hudson, in New York; the
lower Mississippi, in Louisiana and Tennessee; the Rio Grande, in
Texas; the Potomac, in the District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia
and West Virginia; the St. Johns, in Florida; the upper
Mississippi, in Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota and Missouri; the upper
Susquehanna and Lackawanna, in Pennsylvania; and the Willamette, in
Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   The rivers now are eligible for federal money for further
environmental protection and preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is a racking horse?
</P>
<P>
   A: Similar to the Tennessee Walking Horse, the racking horse is
considered a ``light'' horse compared to other breeds, averaging
15.2 hands (a ``hand'' is 4 inches) and weighing about 1,000
pounds, according to the Racking Horse Breeders' Association. It
has a smooth, natural gait, is very strong, and has the ability to
sustain a rapid pace for long periods. The horse's popularity grew
on Southern plantations in the nation's early days when it was
learned that it could be ridden comfortably for hours.
</P>
<P>
   The ``rack'' of the racking horse is a bilateral four-beat gait
which is neither a pace nor a trot. It is often called a ``single
foot'' because only one foot strikes the ground at a time, and it
has been described as a ``running walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you tell me the names of the teams in the old Negro
baseball leagues? When were the leagues in existence?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Negro National League was founded in 1920; the Negro
American League started in 1937. When the color bar was lifted in
1947, the teams and leagues started to falter as their stars began
signing contracts with major league clubs. But the term ``Negro
Leagues'' generally is regarded as encompassing virtually all
professional, all-Negro baseball teams operating between 1880 and
1955. There were hundreds of such teams traveling throughout the
United States, most without formal league affiliations.
</P>
<P>
   These were among the more succesful, better-known clubs
operating in the 1920-55 era: Atlanta Black Crackers; Baltimore
Black Sox; Baltimore Elite Giants (which began as the Nashville
Elite Giants, moving then to Columbus, Ohio, followed by Washington
and then Baltimore); Birmingham Black Barons; Chicago American
Giants; Cincinnati Tigers; Cleveland Browns; Columbus (Ohio)
Buckeyes; Cuban Giants (which began as the Argyle Athletics, named
because its players also worked at the Argyle Hotel in Babylon,
N.Y.); Detroit Stars; Homestead (Pa.) Grays, (near Pittsburgh);
Indianapolis ABCs; Indianapolis Clowns (which originated in Miami
as the Ethiopian Clowns); Kansas City Monarchs; Memphis Red Sox;
Miami Giants; Milwaukee Bears; Montgomery (Ala.) Grey Sox; New York
Black Yankees; New York Cubans; Newark Eagles; Philadelphia Stars;
Pittsburgh Crawfords; Pittsburgh Keystones.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you update us on the great pianist Carmen Cavallaro? The
last I heard, he was living in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   A: The big-band era pianist, composer and bandleader died of
cancer in October 1989 in Columbus, Ohio. He was 76 and had lived
in Columbus 15 years. Although he's no longer a household name,
except to those of a certain age, he was immensely popular at one
time. From 1933 to 1937, he was billed simply as Carmen, and in the
'40s he was a sensation playing top hotels in Detroit, Chicago and
New York. In the late '40s, Cavallaro had a Sunday radio show
called ``The Schaeffer Parade,'' and in 1956 he provided the
keyboard artistry simulated by Tyrone Power in the movie ``The
Eddie Duchin Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some animals died recently in the hold of an airliner. Delta
permits passengers, for $60, to carry a pet in a container that
fits under the seat. Since Delta doesn't handle the container, what
is the charge for? What's the difference between a pet in a
container or a piece of luggage that fits under a seat?
</P>
<P>
   A: Delta defends the fee because it views the transportation of
an animal in the passenger compartment as a ``special service'' for
the pet owner. It's ``far and above'' treating it as a piece of
baggage, said Delta spokesman Bill Berry. The airline's rules
permit a limited number of animals to be transported in the cabin,
varying according to the size of the aircraft, and only with
advance arrangements, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the capabilities a president has with respect to
pardons?
</P>
<P>
   A: The presidential power to pardon is an absolute one granted
by the Constitution (Article II, section 2), with one exception:
cases of impeachment. Pardons wipe out both guilt and punishment,
restoring the person pardoned to his or her full civil rights, as
if the offense had never been committed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A news report about the two slain Capitol officers said that
more than 20 people have lain in state at the Capitol Rotunda,
including several former presidents. Can you list them, with dates?
</P>
<P>
   A: Henry Clay, July 1, 1852; Abraham Lincoln, April 19-21, 1865;
Thaddeus Stevens, Aug. 13-14, 1868; Charles Sumner, March 13, 1874;
Henry Wilson, Nov. 25-26, 1875; James Garfield, Sept. 21 and 23,
1881; John A. Logan, Dec. 30-31, 1886; William McKinley, Sept. 17,
1901; Pierre Charles L'Enfant, April 28, 1909 (before reinterment
at Arlington National Cemetery; he died June 4, 1825, and had been
buried first on the Digges farm, Prince George's County, Md.);
George Dewey, Jan. 20, 1917; Unknown Soldier of World War I, Nov.
9-11, 1921; Warren Harding, Aug. 8, 1923; William Howard Taft,
March 11, 1930; John Joseph Pershing, July 18-19, 1948; Robert A.
Taft, Aug. 2-3, 1953; Unknown Soldiers of World War II and the
Korean War, May 28-30, 1958; John F. Kennedy, Nov. 24-25, 1963;
Douglas MacArthur, April 8-9, 1964; Herbert Hoover, Oct. 23-25,
1964; Dwight Eisenhower, March 30-31, 1969; Everett Dirksen, Sept.
9-10, 1969; J. Edgar Hoover, May 3-4, 1972; Lyndon Johnson, Jan.
24-25, 1973; Hubert Humphrey, Jan. 14-15, 1978; Unknown Soldier of
the Vietnam Era, May 1984; and Claude Pepper, June 1, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When Roy Rogers died a few weeks ago, he received an enormous
amount of news coverage. Barely mentioned, however, was his
sidekick Gabby Hayes. For the benefit of fans of old Hollywood
westerns, can you print a few details about his life?
</P>
<P>
   A: Glad to oblige, pardner. George ``Gabby'' Hayes, born May 7,
1885, in Stannards, N.Y., was a staple in westerns, starting with
his 1929 film debut in ``The Western Man.'' The beloved,
bewhiskered Hayes went on to appear in about 185 films plus
assorted shorts, serials and TV programs. His last movie, in 1951,
was ``Pals of the Golden West.'' Hayes also played sidekick to such
other big screen stars as Hopalong Cassidy, Gene Autry and John
Wayne. Hayes attended schools through the seventh grade in
Wellsville, N.Y. After moving to California, he married actress
Dorothy Earle. She died in 1958; Hayes died Feb. 9, 1969, of a
heart ailment. He is buried at Forest Lawn-Hollywood Hills in Los
Angeles.

American League started in 1937. When the color bar was lifted in
1947, the teams and leagues started to falter as their stars began
signing contracts with major league clubs. But the term ``Negro
Leagues'' generally is regarded as encompassing virtually all
professional, all-Negro baseball teams operating between 1880 and
1955. There were hundreds of such teams traveling throughout the
United States, most without formal league affiliations.
</P>
<P>
   These were among the more succesful, better-known clubs
operating in the 1920-55 era: Atlanta Black Crackers; Baltimore
Black Sox; Baltimore Elite Giants (which began as the Nashville
Elite Giants, moving then to Columbus, Ohio, followed by Washington
and then Baltimore); Birmingham Black Barons; Chicago American
Giants; Cincinnati Tigers; Cleveland Browns; Columbus (Ohio)
Buckeyes; Cuban Giants (which began as the Argyle Athletics, named
because its players also worked at the Argyle Hotel in Babylon,
N.Y.); Detroit Stars; Homestead (Pa.) Grays, (near Pittsburgh);
Indianapolis ABCs; Indianapolis Clowns (which originated in Miami
as the Ethiopian Clowns); Kansas City Monarchs; Memphis Red Sox;
Miami Giants; Milwaukee Bears; Montgomery (Ala.) Grey Sox; New York
Black Yankees; New York Cubans; Newark Eagles; Philadelphia Stars;
Pittsburgh Crawfords; Pittsburgh Keystones.

<P>
   Q: Can you update us on the great pianist Carmen Cavallaro? The
last I heard, he was living in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   A: The big-band era pianist, composer and bandleader died of
cancer in October 1989 in Columbus, Ohio. He was 76 and had lived
in Columbus 15 years. Although he's no longer a household name,
except to those of a certain age, he was immensely popular at one
time. From 1933 to 1937, he was billed simply as Carmen, and in the
'40s he was a sensation playing top hotels in Detroit, Chicago and
New York. In the late '40s, Cavallaro had a Sunday radio show
called ``The Schaeffer Parade,'' and in 1956 he provided the
keyboard artistry simulated by Tyrone Power in the movie ``The
Eddie Duchin Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some animals died recently in the hold of an airliner. Delta
permits passengers, for $60, to carry a pet in a container that
fits under the seat. Since Delta doesn't handle the container, what
is the charge for? What's the difference between a pet in a
container or a piece of luggage that fits under a seat?
</P>
<P>
   A: Delta defends the fee because it views the transportation of
an animal in the passenger compartment as a ``special service'' for
the pet owner. It's ``far and above'' treating it as a piece of
baggage, said Delta spokesman Bill Berry. The airline's rules
permit a limited number of animals to be transported in the cabin,
varying according to the size of the aircraft, and only with
advance arrangements, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the capabilities a president has with respect to
pardons?
</P>
<P>
   A: The presidential power to pardon is an absolute one granted
by the Constitution (Article II, section 2), with one exception:
cases of impeachment. Pardons wipe out both guilt and punishment,
restoring the person pardoned to his or her full civil rights, as
if the offense had never been committed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A news report about the two slain Capitol officers said that
more than 20 people have lain in state at the Capitol Rotunda,
including several former presidents. Can you list them, with dates?
</P>
<P>
   A: Henry Clay, July 1, 1852; Abraham Lincoln, April 19-21, 1865;
Thaddeus Stevens, Aug. 13-14, 1868; Charles Sumner, March 13, 1874;
Henry Wilson, Nov. 25-26, 1875; James Garfield, Sept. 21 and 23,
1881; John A. Logan, Dec. 30-31, 1886; William McKinley, Sept. 17,
1901; Pierre Charles L'Enfant, April 28, 1909 (before reinterment
at Arlington National Cemetery; he died June 4, 1825, and had been
buried first on the Digges farm, Prince George's County, Md.);
George Dewey, Jan. 20, 1917; Unknown Soldier of World War I, Nov.
9-11, 1921; Warren Harding, Aug. 8, 1923; William Howard Taft,
March 11, 1930; John Joseph Pershing, July 18-19, 1948; Robert A.
Taft, Aug. 2-3, 1953; Unknown Soldiers of World War II and the
Korean War, May 28-30, 1958; John F. Kennedy, Nov. 24-25, 1963;
Douglas MacArthur, April 8-9, 1964; Herbert Hoover, Oct. 23-25,
1964; Dwight Eisenhower, March 30-31, 1969; Everett Dirksen, Sept.
9-10, 1969; J. Edgar Hoover, May 3-4, 1972; Lyndon Johnson, Jan.
24-25, 1973; Hubert Humphrey, Jan. 14-15, 1978; Unknown Soldier of
the Vietnam Era, May 1984; and Claude Pepper, June 1, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When Roy Rogers died a few weeks ago, he received an enormous
amount of news coverage. Barely mentioned, however, was his
sidekick Gabby Hayes. For the benefit of fans of old Hollywood
westerns, can you print a few details about his life?
</P>
<P>
   A: Glad to oblige, pardner. George ``Gabby'' Hayes, born May 7,
1885, in Stannards, N.Y., was a staple in westerns, starting with
his 1929 film debut in ``The Western Man.'' The beloved,
bewhiskered Hayes went on to appear in about 185 films plus
assorted shorts, serials and TV programs. His last movie, in 1951,
was ``Pals of the Golden West.'' Hayes also played sidekick to such
other big screen stars as Hopalong Cassidy, Gene Autry and John
Wayne. Hayes attended schools through the seventh grade in
Wellsville, N.Y. After moving to California, he married actress
Dorothy Earle. She died in 1958; Hayes died Feb. 9, 1969, of a
heart ailment. He is buried at Forest Lawn-Hollywood Hills in Los
Angeles.

 &HT;    GNC's cuts in prices has Rexall stock diving
 &HT;    By Phil Galewitz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ Shares in high-flying Rexall Sundown Inc.
plunged 24 percent on Tuesday, after vitamin retail giant General
Nutrition Cos. said it was slashing prices to better compete with
discount chains.
</P>
<P>
   Several other large vitamin makers, such as Twinlab Corp. and
NBTY Inc., also saw shares tumble in heavy trading.
</P>
<P>
   Rexall Chief Executive Chris Nast said Wall Street was
overreacting to General Nutrition's pricing announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Rexall, which employs about 1,200 people at its Boca Raton
headquarters, prices its vitamins and nutritional supplements below
national brands such as GNC, and does not sell in GNC stores. Even
with GNC's plans to cut vitamin C and E as much as 40 percent, Nast
said Rexall will still offer lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with their discounting they won't come anywhere close. .
. . We'll still be dramatically lower,'' Nast said.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst John Mahoney of Raymond James estimates that GNC's
prices for popular vitamins and nutritional supplements are almost
twice that of Rexall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is: Is a price war breaking out in the
vitamins-supplements industry? The answer is yes, it broke out 2
1/2 years ago . . . and GNC just woke up to it,'' Mahoney said.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart started the price war, Mahoney said, when it doubled
shelf space for its own brand vitamins and the Rexall vitamins that
it sells.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney said the vitamin industry is growing at 20 percent a
year and companies that offer lower prices are best positioned to
reap the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident we will maintain our position as a leader in
the industry,'' Nast said.
</P>
<P>
   Rexall (Nasdaq: RXSD) has doubled its sales and profits several
times during the past six years, particularly by moving its goods
into mass retailers such as Wal-Mart and Kmart. GNC sells its
products only through 3,732 GNC stores.
</P>
<P>
   Investors apparently feared that GNC's price-cutting, while
great news for consumers, would erode profits for GNC. And if GNC
saw earnings cut, it might happen at other vitamin concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are looking at this and asking if it's going to be a
trend,'' said analyst Judy Meehan, of Parker Hunter Inc.
</P>
<P>
   After peaking at $38.38 last month, Rexall closed at $22.75
Tuesday, down $7.12 from Monday. That means Carl DeSantis, Rexall
chairman, and his son Damon DeSantis, company president, have seen
the value of their shares drop $457.9 million since last month's
peak. They own 29.3 million shares, or 43.1 percent of the company
stock, according to the latest proxy statement.
</P>
<P>
   Twinlab Corp., a maker of sports nutrition bars that Rexall
proposed to buy last year, fell $10.56 to $28.81. NBTY, another
vitamin maker, fell $2.31 to $13.94.
</P>
<P>
   Nast said the GNC changes should have no effect on the
fast-growing vitamin sector, which is buoyed by Americans' growing
interest in preventive health.
</P>
<P>
   Rexall's stock, which is now down 25 percent since Jan. 1, this
year, has rebounded before, most notably after a critical article
in Barron's financial weekly in 1997 sent the stock down.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, GNC's decision to cut prices is a result of
Rexall's success selling vitamins and herbals through mass
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   GNC said cuts it will begin cutting prices on a rotating basis
in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we look at where our strengths and weaknesses are versus
the mass market, the only that that's apparent on the weak side is
price,'' said GNC President William Watts.

 &HT;    Wal-Mart underwear thief who threatened guards sentenced to life
 &HT;    By Scott Hiaasen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ For pilfering some boxer shorts, panties
and a sports bra, Phillip Sanders will spend the rest of his life
in a prison uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, 43, of West Palm Beach, was sentenced Tuesday to life
in prison without parole after being convicted of armed robbery for
stealing underwear and cigarette lighters worth $49.73 from a
Wal-Mart store in Jupiter, Fla. on Feb. 18.
</P>
<P>
   It began as a simple case of shoplifting, but then Sanders
flashed a knife at two security guards who confronted him in the
parking lot outside the store, according to police reports.
</P>
<P>
   That turned Sanders' petty theft into a felony charge of robbery
with a deadly weapon. His sentence became a life sentence under a
law that requires maximum penalties for offenders who commit crimes
within three years of their release from prison.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders was sent to prison in 1995 on two charges of aggravated
battery, said assistant state attorney Mitch Kilroser. He was
released in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Court records show Sanders would have faced from 75 to 125
months in prison under sentencing guidelines were it not for his
status as a ``prison releasee reoffender.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders' lawyer, assistant public defender Gary Beard, said his
client should not have been charged with robbery because he didn't
threaten anyone with the knife. Sanders used the knife only to cut
open packages before stuffing the underwear into his shirt and
pants, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beard said he plans to appeal the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Sanders) never stopped and said, `I'm going to stab you.'
He never brandished it as a weapon,'' Beard said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who has two children, even turned down a plea deal that
would have given him a 15-year sentence because he thought he was
guilty only of shoplifting, Beard said.
</P>
<P>
   But after a one-day trial, a jury took 49 minutes of
deliberation to find Sanders guilty of robbery, court records show.
And because the law requires repeat offenders to serve maximum
sentences, Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Edward Garrison had no
choice but to sentence Sanders to life.

 &HT;    Vietnam vet loses war medals to thieves
 &HT;    By Susannah A. Nesmith
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ Willard D. Roy is glad he wasn't home
Sunday night when four teenagers broke into his home and stole
medals he earned in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really angry at first,'' Roy said. ``I'm really glad I
didn't catch them because I'd probably be in jail now and there'd
probably be some parents out there that'd be real upset because of
what I might have done to their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Police Cmdr. Chuck Johnson, a Vietnam veteran himself,
sympathizes with Roy. He's working with the Rotary Club to get
replacement medals for Roy, who served in the Marine Corps from
1967 to 1969.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of have a soft spot for Vietnam vets,'' Johnson said.
``He was in the Marines and I was in the Army. We were over there
at the same time. I think of what he went through over there.
Getting his medals back is the least we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Police have interviewed two of the teens and identified two
others, Johnson said. Some of Roy's property, his compact disk
player, a hand-held television and a small pellet gun, were
recovered at the home of one of the teenagers, who are all between
12 and 15.
</P>
<P>
   Roy is a little embarrassed by all the attention his war medals
have garnered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want people coming up treating me like a hero or a
victim,'' he said. ``I just want to live my life.''
</P>
<P>
   And he kind of blames himself for the burglary. The teens got
into his house through an awning window that didn't close all the
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it is probably my own fault because I didn't make the
window so it wouldn't do that,'' he said. ``I'd asked my landlord
but he never did anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy has lived in Port St. Lucie for about a year.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is not sure the department will be able to find the
medals, though officials are still looking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my gut feeling that the kids ditched the medals because
they didn't have any value to them,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Though he appreciates Johnson's efforts to get replacement
medals, Roy said the originals were priceless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather have my own back,'' he said. ``I really wanted them
to pass on to my kid.''

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A on the news
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the Los Angeles Police Department still investigating the
murders of Nicole Simpson Brown and Ron Goldman?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. As long ago as October 1995, police and prosecutors went
on record as saying they had no plans or obligation to reclassify
the Brentwood murders as an open case. ``It's closed,'' said Lt.
John Dunkin of the Los Angeles Police Department. ``It's not an
unsolved case.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials remain convinced that the evidence
proved Simpson guilty of the murders, despite his acquittal. ``I
think that everybody in the business knows who did it,'' prosecutor
Mike Carroll told the Los Angeles Times. ``If a man on the street
has some lingering doubts, that doesn't make us change the official
records or opinion about something.''
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Gil Garcetti responded similarly when asked if
the murder investigation would be reopened.
</P>
<P>
   Q: President Clinton has declared the New River, in North
Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia, one of several American
Heritage Rivers. What are the others?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Blackstone and Woonasquatucket rivers, in Massachusetts
and Rhode Island; the Connecticut, in Connecticut, Vermont, New
Hampshire and Massachusetts; the Cuyahoga, in Ohio; the Detroit, in
Michigan; the Hanalei, in Hawaii; the Hudson, in New York; the
lower Mississippi, in Louisiana and Tennessee; the Rio Grande, in
Texas; the Potomac, in the District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia
and West Virginia; the St. Johns, in Florida; the upper
Mississippi, in Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota and Missouri; the upper
Susquehanna and Lackawanna, in Pennsylvania; and the Willamette, in
Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   The rivers now are eligible for federal money for further
environmental protection and preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is a racking horse?
</P>
<P>
   A: Similar to the Tennessee Walking Horse, the racking horse is
considered a ``light'' horse compared to other breeds, averaging
15.2 hands (a ``hand'' is 4 inches) and weighing about 1,000
pounds, according to the Racking Horse Breeders' Association. It
has a smooth, natural gait, is very strong, and has the ability to
sustain a rapid pace for long periods. The horse's popularity grew
on Southern plantations in the nation's early days when it was
learned that it could be ridden comfortably for hours.
</P>
<P>
   The ``rack'' of the racking horse is a bilateral four-beat gait
which is neither a pace nor a trot. It is often called a ``single
foot'' because only one foot strikes the ground at a time, and it
has been described as a ``running walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you tell me the names of the teams in the old Negro
baseball leagues? When were the leagues in existence?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Negro National League was founded in 1920; the Negro
American League started in 1937. When the color bar was lifted in
1947, the teams and leagues started to falter as their stars began
signing contracts with major league clubs. But the term ``Negro
Leagues'' generally is regarded as encompassing virtually all
professional, all-Negro baseball teams operating between 1880 and
1955. There were hundreds of such teams traveling throughout the
United States, most without formal league affiliations.
</P>
<P>
   These were among the more succesful, better-known clubs
operating in the 1920-55 era: Atlanta Black Crackers; Baltimore
Black Sox; Baltimore Elite Giants (which began as the Nashville
Elite Giants, moving then to Columbus, Ohio, followed by Washington
and then Baltimore); Birmingham Black Barons; Chicago American
Giants; Cincinnati Tigers; Cleveland Browns; Columbus (Ohio)
Buckeyes; Cuban Giants (which began as the Argyle Athletics, named
because its players also worked at the Argyle Hotel in Babylon,
N.Y.); Detroit Stars; Homestead (Pa.) Grays, (near Pittsburgh);
Indianapolis ABCs; Indianapolis Clowns (which originated in Miami
as the Ethiopian Clowns); Kansas City Monarchs; Memphis Red Sox;
Miami Giants; Milwaukee Bears; Montgomery (Ala.) Grey Sox; New York
Black Yankees; New York Cubans; Newark Eagles; Philadelphia Stars;
Pittsburgh Crawfords; Pittsburgh Keystones.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you update us on the great pianist Carmen Cavallaro? The
last I heard, he was living in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   A: The big-band era pianist, composer and bandleader died of
cancer in October 1989 in Columbus, Ohio. He was 76 and had lived
in Columbus 15 years. Although he's no longer a household name,
except to those of a certain age, he was immensely popular at one
time. From 1933 to 1937, he was billed simply as Carmen, and in the
'40s he was a sensation playing top hotels in Detroit, Chicago and
New York. In the late '40s, Cavallaro had a Sunday radio show
called ``The Schaeffer Parade,'' and in 1956 he provided the
keyboard artistry simulated by Tyrone Power in the movie ``The
Eddie Duchin Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some animals died recently in the hold of an airliner. Delta
permits passengers, for $60, to carry a pet in a container that
fits under the seat. Since Delta doesn't handle the container, what
is the charge for? What's the difference between a pet in a
container or a piece of luggage that fits under a seat?
</P>
<P>
   A: Delta defends the fee because it views the transportation of
an animal in the passenger compartment as a ``special service'' for
the pet owner. It's ``far and above'' treating it as a piece of

permit a limited number of animals to be transported in the cabin,
varying according to the size of the aircraft, and only with
advance arrangements, he added.

<P>
   Q: What are the capabilities a president has with respect to
pardons?
</P>
<P>
   A: The presidential power to pardon is an absolute one granted
by the Constitution (Article II, section 2), with one exception:
cases of impeachment. Pardons wipe out both guilt and punishment,
restoring the person pardoned to his or her full civil rights, as
if the offense had never been committed.

<P>
   Q: A news report about the two slain Capitol officers said that
more than 20 people have lain in state at the Capitol Rotunda,
including several former presidents. Can you list them, with dates?
</P>
<P>
   A: Henry Clay, July 1, 1852; Abraham Lincoln, April 19-21, 1865;
Thaddeus Stevens, Aug. 13-14, 1868; Charles Sumner, March 13, 1874;

   Q: When Roy Rogers died a few weeks ago, he received an enormous
amount of news coverage. Barely mentioned, however, was his
sidekick Gabby Hayes. For the benefit of fans of old Hollywood
westerns, can you print a few details about his life?
</P>
<P>
   A: Glad to oblige, pardner. George ``Gabby'' Hayes, born May 7,
1885, in Stannards, N.Y., was a staple in westerns, starting with
his 1929 film debut in ``The Western Man.'' The beloved,
bewhiskered Hayes went on to appear in about 185 films plus
assorted shorts, serials and TV programs. His last movie, in 1951,
was ``Pals of the Golden West.'' Hayes also played sidekick to such
other big screen stars as Hopalong Cassidy, Gene Autry and John
Wayne. Hayes attended schools through the seventh grade in
Wellsville, N.Y. After moving to California, he married actress
Dorothy Earle. She died in 1958; Hayes died Feb. 9, 1969, of a
heart ailment. He is buried at Forest Lawn-Hollywood Hills in Los
Angeles.

<P>
   UNDATED: For the benefit of fans of old Hollywood westerns, can
you print a few details about Gabby Hayes' life?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who is the current owner of the just-demolished O.J. Simpson
house in Los Angeles, and what did the person pay for it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The new owner of the 6,000-square-foot home at 360 N.
Rockingham Ave. was Kenneth Abdalla, president of the L.A.-based
Jerry's Famous Deli chain and co-owner of the investment firm
Waterton Management. He and his wife, Kay Stoneburner, were said to
be unimpressed by the 57-year-old Tudor-style mansion, but wanted
the prime corner lot in Brentwood, one of L.A.'s ritziest
neighborhoods. Only the tennis court is being saved. Abdalla paid
$3.95 million for the house, according to property records.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Former Alabama Gov. George Wallace is back in the news after
being hospitalized in Montgomery for a respiratory condition.
Whatever happened to Arthur Bremer, who shot Wallace back in 1972?
Did he ever get out of prison?
</P>
<P>
   A. No. Bremer remains at the Maryland Correctional Institution
near Hagerstown, said prison spokesman Leonard Vaughn. Bremer is
serving a 53-year prison term for shooting Wallace and three other
people on May 15, 1972, at a campaign stop in Laurel, Md., when
Wallace was seeking the Democratic presidential nomination.
Bremer's sentence expires in May 2025. When Maryland's Parole
Commission denied parole to Bremer last year, it was reported that
he probably would be released at least 10 years early because of
good behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I feel sure that Eric Robert Rudolph, the bombing suspect,
and the other nine people on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list, are not
the only suspects the FBI is looking for. Is it known how many
people are sought at any given time?
</P>
<P>
   A. About 7,000 fugitives are sought at any one time, according
to the FBI. Through the Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution or
Confinement statute, the FBI for many years has been responsible
for seeking the country's most wanted, violent fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is the status at the Food and Drug Administration of
RU-486, the controversial French abortion pill?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's still an ``unproved drug,'' FDA spokesman Larry Bachorik
told Q&AMP;A. In September 1996, the FDA issued an ``approvable
letter'' to the Population Council, the drug's sponsor, meaning the
FDA had determined, on the basis of clinical data submitted, that
RU-486 is safe and effective for its intended use. A final decision
on approval is awaiting information from the Population Council on
such matters as manufacturing and labeling, Bachorik said.
</P>
<P>
   The Population Council was given U.S. rights to the drug, known
as mifepristone, in 1994 by French manufacturer Roussel Uclaf. The
Council then licensed its rights to the Danco Group, a newly
created pharmaceutical firm. Mifepristone works by blocking the
effects of a hormone necessary to maintain pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA's Internet site, www.fda.gov, has more information on
its mifepristone approvable letter. Click on What's New, then look
in Archives for a talk paper issued Sept. 18, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I heard that the United States was actually bombed during
World War II by a balloon or something that came over the Pacific
from Japan. Someone in Oregon supposedly was killed. Can you verify
this?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's true. The balloon incident was in the news most recently
at the death last October of Nobuo Fujita, the Japanese warrant
officer who dropped bombs over Oregon from a small aircraft which
took off from a submarine.
</P>
<P>
   As Q&AMP;A reported at the time, Japan released thousands of
balloons carrying bombs in World War II, hoping the winds would
carry them across the ocean to the western United States. Most
apparently fell into the water, but a few did reach land and ignite
small fires. The only fatalities involved a person on a church
outing in Oregon and perhaps a woman in Montana. Some unexploded
bombs could still be scattered around remote areas in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Q. My family and I spent four summers in Dallas in the late '60s
and early '70s, and I recall that one summer, I think 1969, the
temperature reached 100 more than 40 consecutive days. Can you
confirm? Also, what is the record for the most consecutive days
over 100 degrees in Dallas? What is the record high temperature
there?
</P>
<P>
   A. In 1969, the string of consecutive days with 100-plus highs
was 27, said Brian Curran of the National Weather Service in Fort
Worth, which handles the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The longest string
of consecutive 100-plus days ever recorded at DFW _ 42 _ came in
1980, he said. The highest recorded temperature on record was 113,
reached on two consecutive days, June 26-27, 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Q. On average, how many interns does the White House have at any
given time? How long do they serve? What is the process for
selecting which applicants get chosen? What are their normal
duties? Is it usual that an intern would have access to the Oval
Office?
</P>
<P>
   A. In President Clinton's White House, there are about 1,000
interns a year, serving in four groups of 250 each. The length of
service varies.
</P>
<P>
   Many interns are said to get to the White House because their
families have wealth or political influence, but that isn't always
the case. Intern applicants follow a routine application process,
submitting a college transcript, resume, essay and two letters of
recommendation. Those admitted undergo drug tests, FBI background
checks, screenings by the president's security team and briefings
by the FBI, Secret Service and the Metropolitan D.C. police.
</P>
<P>
   The interns' duties are varied, with many spending their time
doing menial tasks such as answering telephones, running errands,
picking up packages, opening mail, shuttling papers and
information, making photocopies and, in general, being ``gofers.''
Interns wear badges with an ``I'' prominently displayed,
restricting their access to the West Wing, where the Oval Office is
located. So it wouldn't be ``usual'' for such a person to be in the
Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What do the three initials, YKK, on a zipper mean?
</P>
<P>
   A. Credit Todao Yoshida, who in 1934 founded a zipper
manufacturing company in Karobe, Japan, that carried his name:
Yoshida Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha, or YKK for short (no third K). That
long Japanese name translates roughly into English as Yoshida
Company Limited. Over the years, the letters YKK were stamped on
the company's zippers' pull tabs, becoming the company's trademark.
In 1994, the name of the famous brand became the name of the
company as well: YKK Corp.
</P>
<P>
   YKK also makes hook and loop tape fastening systems, webbings,
buckles and metal and plastic notions, as well as aluminum building
products such as windows and entrance systems for low-, medium- and
high-rise applications. The company likes to say, ``Whether you
realize it or not, you probably start your day with YKK.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the worldwide parent company has its headquarters in
Japan, YKK has a strong U.S. presence. Its American company, YKK
Corp. of America, has its headquarters in Marietta, Ga., and in New
Jersey, and it operates a manufacturing center in Macon, Ga.,
producing 7 million zips a day.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I say Nick Clooney, host of the American Movie Channel, is
the brother of singer Rosemary Clooney, and actor George Clooney is
his son. My friend says Nick is Rosemary's son, and George is her
grandson. Which of us is right?
</P>
<P>
   A. You are. Rosemary and Nick Clooney, host of American Movie
Classics, are sister and brother. George is Nick's son (Rosemary's
nephew).
</P>
<P>
   Q. What does ``black operation'' mean? The term was mentioned in
an article on CNN's report about nerve gas supposedly used by the
United States against American defectors in Laos in 1970. The
article quoted April Oliver, who co-produced CNN's report, as
defending the contents, and saying a lack of documentary evidence
provided by the Pentagon ``doesn't surprise me, given that this was
a 'black operation.' ``
</P>
<P>
   A. It's military slang for a covert mission that occurs, but
officially is denied to have occurred. The reference to ``black''
alludes to dark, as in night, or without light. According to
Oliver, no records were kept that the operation she described took
place. However, the Pentagon maintains that even for an activity
such as Operation Tailwind, records are kept, citing reports
listing munitions used as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   CNN later retracted the June 7 ``NewsStand'' sarin nerve gas
report and apologized for it. Oliver continues to maintain that it
was accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Q. ``Schindler's List'' was included among novels recently
selected by Radcliff students as their 100 favorites. I didn't
think it was a novel. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A. In his Author's Note, Australian novelist Thomas Keneally
explains: ``To use the texture and devices of a novel to tell a
true story is a course that has frequently been followed in modern
writing. It is the one I choose to follow here _ both because the
novelist's craft is the only one I can lay claim to, and because
the novel's techniques seem suited for a character of such
ambiguity and magnitude as Oskar (Schindler). I have attempted,
however, to avoid all fiction, since fiction would debase the
record, and to distinguish between reality and the myths which are
likely to attach themselves to a man of Oskar's stature.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. Don't Federal Communications Commission regulations make it
illegal for television commercials to be broadcast at higher
volumes than regular programming?
</P>
<P>
   A. Although the advertising industry disputes the contention
that noise levels increase for commercials, the issue has been
simmering for years. The FCC, in fact, has been looking into it for
decades. But it concluded long ago that there's no clear way to
impose new regulations that would be effective in controlling
``apparent'' loudness of commercial announcements over AM, FM and
TV broadcast stations.
</P>
<P>
   The commission issued notices of inquiry in 1963 and 1979, and a
policy statement in1965, to assist broadcasters in matching
commercial loudness to program loudness. In June 1984, the FCC
announced that it had terminated its inquiries. Loudness is ``very
subjective'' and varies from listener to listener, the FCC said.
``Listeners weigh the content, subject matter, style, format,
presentation, video information and perhaps some less well-defined
stimuli when deciding whether a commercial is loud.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. I didn't hear any comment from President Clinton in the
immediate aftermath of the shootings at the Capitol. Did he express
sympathy?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. As reported July 25, after the shootings the day before,
the White House immediately issued a written statement. Calling the
Capitol ``the people's house, a place where visitors and workers
should not have to fear violence,'' Clinton described himself and
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton as ``deeply disturbed.'' He
added: ``Every American appreciates the bravery of the Capitol
Police who prevented further injury through their courageous
actions.''

people on May 15, 1972, at a campaign stop in Laurel, Md., when
Wallace was seeking the Democratic presidential nomination.
Bremer's sentence expires in May 2025. When Maryland's Parole
Commission denied parole to Bremer last year, it was reported that
he probably would be released at least 10 years early because of
good behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I feel sure that Eric Robert Rudolph, the bombing suspect,
and the other nine people on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list, are not
the only suspects the FBI is looking for. Is it known how many
people are sought at any given time?
</P>
<P>
   A. About 7,000 fugitives are sought at any one time, according
to the FBI. Through the Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution or
Confinement statute, the FBI for many years has been responsible
for seeking the country's most wanted, violent fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is the status at the Food and Drug Administration of
RU-486, the controversial French abortion pill?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's still an ``unproved drug,'' FDA spokesman Larry Bachorik
told Q&AMP;A. In September 1996, the FDA issued an ``approvable
letter'' to the Population Council, the drug's sponsor, meaning the
FDA had determined, on the basis of clinical data submitted, that
RU-486 is safe and effective for its intended use. A final decision
on approval is awaiting information from the Population Council on
such matters as manufacturing and labeling, Bachorik said.
</P>
<P>
   The Population Council was given U.S. rights to the drug, known
as mifepristone, in 1994 by French manufacturer Roussel Uclaf. The
Council then licensed its rights to the Danco Group, a newly
created pharmaceutical firm. Mifepristone works by blocking the
effects of a hormone necessary to maintain pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA's Internet site, www.fda.gov, has more information on
its mifepristone approvable letter. Click on What's New, then look
in Archives for a talk paper issued Sept. 18, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I heard that the United States was actually bombed during
World War II by a balloon or something that came over the Pacific
from Japan. Someone in Oregon supposedly was killed. Can you verify
this?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's true. The balloon incident was in the news most recently
at the death last October of Nobuo Fujita, the Japanese warrant
officer who dropped bombs over Oregon from a small aircraft which
took off from a submarine.
</P>
<P>
   As Q&AMP;A reported at the time, Japan released thousands of
balloons carrying bombs in World War II, hoping the winds would
carry them across the ocean to the western United States. Most
apparently fell into the water, but a few did reach land and ignite
small fires. The only fatalities involved a person on a church
outing in Oregon and perhaps a woman in Montana. Some unexploded
bombs could still be scattered around remote areas in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Q. My family and I spent four summers in Dallas in the late '60s
and early '70s, and I recall that one summer, I think 1969, the
temperature reached 100 more than 40 consecutive days. Can you
confirm? Also, what is the record for the most consecutive days
over 100 degrees in Dallas? What is the record high temperature
there?
</P>
<P>
   A. In 1969, the string of consecutive days with 100-plus highs
was 27, said Brian Curran of the National Weather Service in Fort
Worth, which handles the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The longest string
of consecutive 100-plus days ever recorded at DFW _ 42 _ came in
1980, he said. The highest recorded temperature on record was 113,
reached on two consecutive days, June 26-27, 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Q. On average, how many interns does the White House have at any
given time? How long do they serve? What is the process for
selecting which applicants get chosen? What are their normal
duties? Is it usual that an intern would have access to the Oval
Office?
</P>
<P>
   A. In President Clinton's White House, there are about 1,000
interns a year, serving in four groups of 250 each. The length of
service varies.
</P>
<P>
   Many interns are said to get to the White House because their
families have wealth or political influence, but that isn't always
the case. Intern applicants follow a routine application process,
submitting a college transcript, resume, essay and two letters of
recommendation. Those admitted undergo drug tests, FBI background
checks, screenings by the president's security team and briefings
by the FBI, Secret Service and the Metropolitan D.C. police.
</P>
<P>
   The interns' duties are varied, with many spending their time
doing menial tasks such as answering telephones, running errands,
picking up packages, opening mail, shuttling papers and
information, making photocopies and, in general, being ``gofers.''
Interns wear badges with an ``I'' prominently displayed,
restricting their access to the West Wing, where the Oval Office is
located. So it wouldn't be ``usual'' for such a person to be in the
Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What do the three initials, YKK, on a zipper mean?
</P>
<P>
   A. Credit Todao Yoshida, who in 1934 founded a zipper
manufacturing company in Karobe, Japan, that carried his name:
Yoshida Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha, or YKK for short (no third K). That
long Japanese name translates roughly into English as Yoshida
Company Limited. Over the years, the letters YKK were stamped on
the company's zippers' pull tabs, becoming the company's trademark.
In 1994, the name of the famous brand became the name of the
company as well: YKK Corp.
</P>
<P>
   YKK also makes hook and loop tape fastening systems, webbings,
buckles and metal and plastic notions, as well as aluminum building
products such as windows and entrance systems for low-, medium- and
high-rise applications. The company likes to say, ``Whether you
realize it or not, you probably start your day with YKK.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the worldwide parent company has its headquarters in
Japan, YKK has a strong U.S. presence. Its American company, YKK
Corp. of America, has its headquarters in Marietta, Ga., and in New
Jersey, and it operates a manufacturing center in Macon, Ga.,
producing 7 million zips a day.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I say Nick Clooney, host of the American Movie Channel, is
the brother of singer Rosemary Clooney, and actor George Clooney is
his son. My friend says Nick is Rosemary's son, and George is her
grandson. Which of us is right?
</P>
<P>
   A. You are. Rosemary and Nick Clooney, host of American Movie
Classics, are sister and brother. George is Nick's son (Rosemary's
nephew).
</P>
<P>
   Q. What does ``black operation'' mean? The term was mentioned in
an article on CNN's report about nerve gas supposedly used by the
United States against American defectors in Laos in 1970. The
article quoted April Oliver, who co-produced CNN's report, as
defending the contents, and saying a lack of documentary evidence
provided by the Pentagon ``doesn't surprise me, given that this was
a 'black operation.' ``
</P>
<P>
   A. It's military slang for a covert mission that occurs, but
officially is denied to have occurred. The reference to ``black''
alludes to dark, as in night, or without light. According to
Oliver, no records were kept that the operation she described took
place. However, the Pentagon maintains that even for an activity
such as Operation Tailwind, records are kept, citing reports
listing munitions used as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   CNN later retracted the June 7 ``NewsStand'' sarin nerve gas
report and apologized for it. Oliver continues to maintain that it
was accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Q. ``Schindler's List'' was included among novels recently
selected by Radcliff students as their 100 favorites. I didn't
think it was a novel. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A. In his Author's Note, Australian novelist Thomas Keneally
explains: ``To use the texture and devices of a novel to tell a
true story is a course that has frequently been followed in modern
writing. It is the one I choose to follow here _ both because the
novelist's craft is the only one I can lay claim to, and because
the novel's techniques seem suited for a character of such
ambiguity and magnitude as Oskar (Schindler). I have attempted,
however, to avoid all fiction, since fiction would debase the
record, and to distinguish between reality and the myths which are
likely to attach themselves to a man of Oskar's stature.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. Don't Federal Communications Commission regulations make it
illegal for television commercials to be broadcast at higher
volumes than regular programming?
</P>
<P>
   A. Although the advertising industry disputes the contention
that noise levels increase for commercials, the issue has been
simmering for years. The FCC, in fact, has been looking into it for
decades. But it concluded long ago that there's no clear way to
impose new regulations that would be effective in controlling
``apparent'' loudness of commercial announcements over AM, FM and
TV broadcast stations.
</P>
<P>
   The commission issued notices of inquiry in 1963 and 1979, and a
policy statement in1965, to assist broadcasters in matching
commercial loudness to program loudness. In June 1984, the FCC
announced that it had terminated its inquiries. Loudness is ``very
subjective'' and varies from listener to listener, the FCC said.
``Listeners weigh the content, subject matter, style, format,
presentation, video information and perhaps some less well-defined
stimuli when deciding whether a commercial is loud.''
</P>
<P>
   Q. I didn't hear any comment from President Clinton in the
immediate aftermath of the shootings at the Capitol. Did he express
sympathy?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. As reported July 25, after the shootings the day before,
the White House immediately issued a written statement. Calling the
Capitol ``the people's house, a place where visitors and workers
should not have to fear violence,'' Clinton described himself and
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton as ``deeply disturbed.'' He
added: ``Every American appreciates the bravery of the Capitol
Police who prevented further injury through their courageous
actions.''

 &HT;    Federal disease investigators study Brushy Creek outbreak
 &HT;    By Christian Davenport
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN -- Three federal disease investigators from Atlanta went
door-to-door in Brushy Creek recently, collecting blood and stool
samples from residents to study the health effects of a sewage
spill that tainted water wells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to try and find out why certain individuals in a
household have varying degrees of the infection,'' said Bruce
Furness, an epidemic intelligence officer from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   The officers have been canvassing Brushy Creek Municipal Utility
District since Saturday, August 1, seeking those who are showing
signs of the Cryptosporidium infection.
</P>
<P>
   On July 14, a City of Austin sewage pumping station lost power
during a thunderstorm. Since then 29 wells, including four public
wells, were contaminated. The four public wells, which served the
Brushy Creek MUD, were shut down a week after the spill.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 times a year, the CDC sends officers to survey an area
where an outbreak of a disease has occurred, said Tom Skinner, a
spokesman for the Atlanta-based centers. While the majority of
those investigations are domestic, he said, ``we do go all over the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The CDC officers in Brushy Creek will perform the same tasks
they would in any other place, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll try to investigate the outbreak and figure out how
many people are sick,'' Skinner said. ``They'll also try to
determine how they got this disease.''
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday afternoon, 20 of 59 people tested for
Cryptosporidium have been found to be infected with the rare and
infectious parasite, according to the Texas Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   The Williamson County and Cities Health District has responded
to more than 400 calls from people reporting the symptoms of
Cryptosporidium: vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, stomach cramps.
Residents of the Brushy Creek area who have such symptoms are urged
to call the health district at 930-3373.
</P>
<P>
   Private well owners who want their wells tested can call
322-8264.

 &HT;    The Passing of a Kinder, Gentler TV Era
 &HT;    ATTN: Embargoed for Aug. 6
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Baby boomers are mourning, so be nice to us.
</P>
<P>
   Last week we lost Buffalo Bob, the chipper fellow with the
Ronald Reagan hair who gave us the first popular kids' TV show,
``Howdy Doody.'' And this week we said goodbye to Shari Lewis, the
perky, sweet-natured ventriloquist whose lovable sock puppets Lamb
Chop, Charlie Horse and Hush Puppy warmed our hearts and made us
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   These two television pioneers gave birth to shows that the first
wave of boomers grew up watching, shows that existed primarily for
fun. They were not created by a committee of network executives
looking to sell the most candy bars or a group of child
psychologists hoping to insulate kids from the ills of society.
</P>
<P>
   Early kids' shows existed because Bob Smith (aka Buffalo Bob)
and Lewis created them and because children had a good time
watching them. Entertainment, not sales or demographics, was the
key concern. Secondarily, they also taught us to be polite and
encouraged us to read.
</P>
<P>
   The passing of Smith and Lewis, along with the recent demise of
``Father Knows Best'' star Robert Young and singing cowboy Roy
Rogers, has set off a wave of bittersweet nostalgia. (It also has
us wondering how Bob Keeshan of ``Captain Kangaroo'' fame is doing
these days.)
</P>
<P>
   Boomers everywhere are recalling their favorite shows of
yesteryear, programs we watched on Saturday mornings with our
siblings and friends and programs we watched in the evenings with
our parents. Lewis's death prompted a major ``do-you-remember?''
session in this office.
</P>
<P>
   There were shows, like ``Lassie'' and ``Ozzie and Harriet,''
that everybody remembered. And there were the more obscure shows,
like ``Sir Lancelot,'' that only a few (OK, only I) remembered.
Trivia fiends (that would be me) recalled that Keeshan, before he
became ``Captain Kangaroo,'' played the silent clown Clarabell on
``Howdy Doody,'' and Shari Lewis started out with a guest stint on
``Captain Kangaroo.'' Television was a small, friendly world back
then.
</P>
<P>
   It's only natural, I suppose, that our TV ``parents'' are
leaving us now. Our real parents are aging seniors, and we're not
exactly young adults ourselves. Before they're all gone, we should
take a moment to remember the television of our youth. It may not
have been as enriching as ``Sesame Street'' or as hip as ``Bill
Nye, Science Guy,'' but it sure was fun.
</P>
<P>
   Television and baby boomers grew up together. In fact, TV turned
50 this year, and so did millions of boomers. Both the medium and
we young middle-agers were kinder, gentler and simpler than TV and
kids are today. In the 1950s, TV creators concocted shows without
thinking about audience or content ratings. Life in general was
more polite then, so it wouldn't have occurred to TV writers to
talk about bodily functions or utter expletives.
</P>
<P>
   Today's programs are designed like cars, rolling off factory
lines with all the specific accessories, colors and demographics in
mind. Here comes a TV-Y. Uh-oh, too many TV-Ys. Better churn out a
couple of Y-7s and PGs. There's a formula for everything.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days of television, nobody thought about
demographics. They thought about entertainment. They thought about
engaging whoever turned on the magic box and sat down to watch.
Everything was fresh and new because nothing had been done before.
The shiny new set in the living room was a blank canvas on which to
paint, and nobody was telling the artists what to draw on it.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis told me in a 1992 interview that her programs were
designed ``to stimulate, not educate. This is television that you
don't view, you do.'' She loved the notion that kids would sing
along with Lamb Chop.
</P>
<P>
   In the '50s, viewers were so mesmerized by the new medium they
wouldn't have dreamed of changing the channel in the middle of a
program _ even if a show got boring or a commercial jingle was
annoying. Producers didn't have to worry about viewers drifting
away, so the pace of programs wasn't as frantic as it is today. No
remote, no problem.
</P>
<P>
   The big, black line dividing kids' shows from grown-up shows
didn't exist. Although few parents grabbed their sugar-loaded
cereals and ran to the TV to watch Lamb Chop bat her eyelashes on
Saturday mornings, some did join their children for kid favorites
such as ``Fury'' (about a boy and his horse) and ``Sky King''
(about a rancher and his plane). We were all in the Peanut Gallery
together.
</P>
<P>
   Families watched ``Father Knows Best'' without being told it was
TV-G and safe for kids. Parents didn't have to ask kids to leave
the room because ``adult'' shows were coming on. We stayed,
sometimes until bed-time, watching ``The Ed Sullivan Show,'' ``I
Love Lucy,'' ``The Jackie Gleason Show,'' ``Your Show of Shows''
and many more. I was even allowed to watch the bone-chilling
``Alfred Hitchcock Presents'' with my parents. That may not have
been the healthiest decision for them to make, but we have fond
memories of squealing and shuddering in unison during the weekly
episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Today, of course, many parents happily plop young children in
front of ``Sesame Street'' and a handful of other ``nutritional''
shows, but they worry constantly that impressionable tykes will
stumble onto the foul-mouthed kids from ``South Park'' or the
sex-obsessed young folks from ``Melrose Place.''
</P>
<P>
   When boomers were kids, television was the least of our parents'
worries. They fretted over fall-out shelters and the spread of
communism, but television wasn't a threat. It brought families
together and was affectionately called ``the electronic campfire.''
Even if our own families didn't resemble the Andersons or the
Cleavers, it was nice having them in our living rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Because everything that was on TV was gentler, we had a bigger
menu of choices. We watched variety shows (remember Topo Gigio, the
Italian mouse, on ``Ed Sullivan'' and the June Taylor Dancers on
``Jackie Gleason?''), the comedy of Milton Berle, the cop capers of
``Dragnet'' and the pre-Power Ball fantasy of ``The Millionaire.''
In my house, we also enjoyed game shows like ``What's My Line?''
and ``I've Got a Secret.''
</P>
<P>
   Television still has that magical power to pull families
together and enthrall young children. But it's certainly harder to
find those come-together programs today. When Roy rode the range
and Lamb Chop asked silly questions, it was much easier to gather
around the campfire.

EVEN CANADA'S   FOIBLES ARE   ENDEARING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For American commentators, there is only one possible stance
toward Canada: casual, caustic disdain. A few years ago, when I
proposed an article on Oxford University Press's curious
``Dictionary of Canadian English,'' my editor responded
enthusiastically. ``By all means, yes!'' he gushed. ``Canadians are
the last people on earth it's safe to make fun of.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet ... It's hard not to notice that I've spent my last two
vacations in Canada, a long weekend in Toronto and 10 days in Nova
Scotia. Cynics will say that I followed the sinking Canadian
dollar, but if I combined my vacations with currency plays, I could
have bought an island in Indonesia for the price of a ferry ticket
to Yarmouth. I vacation in Canada because I like it.
</P>
<P>
   I discovered why I like Canada while reading an article by
Norman Spector, a publisher who recently completed a tour as
Canada's ambassador to Israel. In his piece, Spector contrasted
Israel's rambunctious social codes with those of his native land.
He called Canada ``the peaceable kingdom,'' and I thought yes,
that's right. He's got it.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, Canadians compare themselves with their large and
powerful neighbor to the south. They stack up quite well. Canada is
comparatively unspoiled, comparatively civil, and enjoys a
comparative prosperity that is more willingly shared among its
citizens. While hardly crime-free, Canada is comparatively
peaceable. The one type of contraband the customs agents never
forget to ask after is firearms, our most unsavory illicit export.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not enthralled by Canada's much-vaunted social programs.
Giving huge swatches of resource-rich wilderness back to the First
Nations, as they call their Indians, seems silly to me. And while I
see that they have the most equitable system of health care in
North America, it's not the best system. But even in their
shortcomings, Canadians exhibit a certain nobility. (I, for one,
would have bombed Quebec years ago.) At home and abroad, Canadian
politicians and diplomats are always trying to do the right thing.
Who can fault them for that?
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the peaceable kingdom can be too darned
peaceable. The Toronto Globe and Mail reports that the memoir
craze, a la Frank McCourt and Kathryn Harrison, has just struck
north of the border. But the newspaper warns us not to expect lurid
tales of incest or depraved poverty from the locals: ``Canadians
Air Their Clean Laundry,'' we read. One of the 20 authors
publishing a memoir during the coming season sheepishly confesses,
``Life went well for me as a child.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Canadians can be a little over-earnest. While consulting my
map of Nova Scotia, I happened upon the Tourism Industry
Association's five-point ``Code of Ethics for Tourists.'' The first
commandment: ``Enjoy our diverse natural and cultural heritage, and
help us to protect and preserve it.'' On the other hand, my
ramblings around Toronto's neatly landscaped city center were
buoyed by the repeated invitation ``Please Walk on the Grass.''
</P>
<P>
   For those bent on poking fun at Snow Mexico, there will always
be ample material. I had to smile when reading that a Nova Scotia
hairdresser had been fined $500 for ``illegal hair coloring,'' an
offense largely unknown in the Lower 48. A friend sent me Maclean's
magazine's new list of the 100 Most Important Canadians in History.
``You may even have been considered for the list,'' he informed me,
``since it includes Alexander Graham Bell, another famous
non-Canadian who spent time in Nova Scotia.'' Because so few women
made the list, Maclean's lumped in fictional overachievers such as
Evangeline, star of the eponymous Longfellow poem, and Anne of
Green Gables.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent New York Times essay, humorist Calvin Trillin
claimed one-sixth Canadian citizenship because he spends two months
of each year north of our border. By that measure, I'm one-26th
Canadian; a small fraction, but perhaps my better part.

<P>
   The one misstep is Packer's too-sympathetic portrait of
Shylock's daughter, Jessica, perhaps literature's first
self-hating, ultra-assimilationist Jew. The main addition is ending
not with Shakespeare's happily-ever-after ending with Jessica
gallivanting off with her Christian friends, but _ skip to the next
paragraph if you don't want to know _ with a devastated Shylock at
Hebrew prayer. That much is fine, and even desirable given what
Packer has been aiming for. But to have Jessica look back in tears
and join him in prayer seems heavy-handed and takes the focus off
of Shylock. Jessica hasn't earned her tears.
</P>
<P>
   But in Packer's staging of ``The Merchant of Venice,'' nobody is
perfect. For the duration of the three-hour-plus production,
though, you're awfully tempted to exempt Tina Packer, Jonathan
Epstein, and Shakespeare &AMP; Company from that adage.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Corley's production of ``Desire Under the Elms'' at the
Berkshire Theatre Festival will be more problematic for many
theatergoers. Corley has been a stalwart of BTF's more experimental
Unicorn Theatre, having directed the haunting production of Tony
Kushner's ``The Illusion'' and last year's masterpiece, ``Quills.''
As a reward, BTF has moved him to the main stage, where he reunites
with Jeremy Davidson _ De Sade in ``Quills'' _ for a ``Desire''
full of the kind of expressionistic stylizations that either sweep
you into the production or leave you completely outside of it.
</P>
<P>
   There is the stark, slanted set for starters; Davidson's feral
portrayal of Eben, the son tortured by his father's hardness and
the loss of his mother's softness; the townspeople in masks doing
unto the protagonists here what the Venetians did unto Shylock.
(There's more than a passing similarity. Susan Dibble, who had a
show of her own at Shakespeare &AMP; Company, choreographed both
productions.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Desire Under the Elms'' isn't as radical a departure from
O'Neill realism as ``The Hairy Ape,'' for example. Here again,
though, a production benefits by taking it out of its normal,
representational context in which the Cabot family can seem like
New England cousins of ``The Beverly Hillbillies'' and moving them
into a form that makes them seem like the descendants of Oedipus
and Medea, which is what O'Neill was aiming for.
</P>
<P>
   The object of Eben's lust isn't his mother, who though dead is
far from buried. Daddy's brought home a new, beautiful bride,
Abbie, played with an understated though stunning sensuality by
Ashley Gardner. When the old man, Ephraim (played too dodderingly
by Jon De Vries), says he has to leave the farm to a son, Abbie
decides to give him an heir of her own. By whatever means
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson and Gardner make beautiful if unconventional music
together, to the point where one is tempted to shout out warnings
about where their misunderstandings are taking them, places in this
production that bring to mind Susan Smith as well as Medea. It has
become the role of the media to make us think of women like them as
monsters; it is the role of art to make us see them as all too
human (``Nature'll beat ye, Eben''). For all its expressionism,
Corley's unmasking of O'Neill's humanism is the crowning
achievement of this production.

   The End of the World, Berkshire Theatre Festival, Unicorn
Theatre _ The expressionism of ``Desire Under the Elms'' looks like
an A.R. Gurney play compared with Roman Paska's ``The End of the
World'' at BTF's second stage. I was not swept into this
production, although Paska's skill as a puppeteer is quite
impressive. The three characters seem to be acting out a cautionary
tale in which the world faces catastrophe for placing so much faith
on Western logic and the ego as opposed to the body and the id.
This ``End of the World'' is draped in spooky atmospherics and
occaionally funny word play, but that's about all there is. The
earth fails to move.

   ``Evolution,'' Williamstown Theatre Festival, Nikos Stage _
Jonathan Marc Sherman is a very gifted writer who, in this case,
tries to draw a line from Charles Darwin's survival of the fittest
to Aaron Spelling's mastery of the universe. It's fun getting there
in Nicholas Martin's production, but the parts greatly outweigh the
sum.

<P>
   ``Italian American Reconciliation,'' Barrington Stage _ John
Patrick Shanley is not a very gifted writer and this play about
confused lovers is not any fun at all except for Marisa Redanty's
fire-breathing, pistol-packing, would-be femme fatale. Audiences
looking for an Italian-American, lighter than lightweight version
of Neil Simon might respond.

   ``The Wharton One-Acts,'' Shakespeare &AMP; Company _ Actually,
there's only one, ``The Dilettante,'' the other being Guy de
Maupassant's ``The Mistress.'' It's the usual, diverting afternoon,
complete with tea and cookies, although Wharton's missing narrative
is far superior to her dialogue in ``The Dilettante.'' Someone has
to tell Diane Prusha she has become too matronly for roles like
this.

FOR KIDS, FIND A FITTING SPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA MATSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cyndi Lauper was right: Girls just want to have fun.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, American culture held that sports were fun _ for
boys.
</P>
<P>
   Now we know better. We know girls like sports, and we know
playing sports is good for girls.
</P>
<P>
   But many parents, particularly those who never had the chance to
play sports themselves, don't know how to get their daughters
started.
</P>
<P>
   Opportunties abound. Do you take your daughter to the soccer
field, or the hockey rink, or the basketball court? To the pool? Or
the riding ring? Or the gymnastics gym?
</P>
<P>
   So many choices.Where do you start?
</P>
<P>
   And what if your girl is timid? Should you push her?
</P>
<P>
   Richard Lapchick, founder and director of the Center for the
Study of Sport in Society at Northeastern University, is the author
of nine books, hundreds of articles, and a frequent speaker and
panelist at sports conferences. But it was an article he wrote
about his daughter Emily's first experience with sports that has
provoked more response than anything he has written.
</P>
<P>
   ``It touched a nerve,'' Lapchick says, ``because so many people
relate to the difficulty of getting kids to compete when they don't
want to. What do you do? ''
</P>
<P>
   Emily was a reluctant 7-year-old soccer player on a co-ed team
in Milton. She had signed up for the youth soccer league because it
looked like fun, the other kids at school were playing, and her
parents believed that soccer was a good sport to start with.
</P>
<P>
   But once she got to the field, Emily's confidence failed her.
She had never played soccer before, and most of the boys on the
team had experience. Despite encouragement from her coaches, Emily
didn't want to play. She would take the field for only a few
minutes each game.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents persisted, refusing to let her quit in midseason.
Then one Saturday, after a backyard kickaround with her mom, Emily
went to her soccer game without protest and when the ball landed at
her feet, she kicked it. Fun! She was off and running.
</P>
<P>
   In the Chicago suburb of Lake Forest, Aleca Hughes had a very
different experience.
</P>
<P>
   Like her older brother, George, she learned to skate at her
preschool, which had its own outdoor rink. Not so unusual in Lake
Forest, where the winters are long and cold, and ice hockey is the
winter sport of choice.
</P>
<P>
   With George and younger brother Gunnar, Aleca started with the
basics. Her mother, Allison, took the kids pond skating with one
sitting in a stroller while another pushed. They learned to push
off and maneuver as they played. By the time Aleca got to an
organized team, the intramural mite team that her mother
co-coached, she knew what she was doing.
</P>
<P>
   That confidence paid off in her exuberance for the game and her
joy in playing.
</P>
<P>
   Allison Hughes said, ``It gave her an edge on all those boys.
She knew she was as fast and as tough as the boys. And she got to
wear a hockey jersey to school with her name on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Climbing onto the schoolbus to go to kindergarten in her team
jersey, one thing was clear: Aleca ruled the bus.
</P>
<P>
   That's what parents want for their daughters, that kind of joy,
self-confidence, and success.
</P>
<P>
   According to many experts, the Hugheses did everything right:
Mom and Dad provided active, athletic role models; they introduced
their daughter to a sport they thought would be fun; and they
taught her the basics before she joined a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is a safe, supportive environment for
kids,'' says Donna Lopiano, executive director of the Women's
Sports Foundation, ``whether it's for reading, writing, or throwing
a ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more successful they are, the more they want to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents should think of two things, says Lopiano: 1) fun; and 2)
success at the sports skill.
</P>
<P>
   It's fun that brings children to sports. And sports are most fun
when children are successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to strike out three times in a row,'' Lopiano says.
``Too many parents have a double standard for children. If their
son strikes out, they take him out in backyard and insist he
practice until he doesn't strike out, but with their daughter, they
say it's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   But of course, it's not OK for the daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's really fun is when someone says `great hit,' or `great
kick,' or you find you're faster than someone else,'' Lopiano says.
</P>
<P>
   Lopiano suggests that children can begin organized sports at age
six or seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``Choose a league that emphasizes development, rather than an
emphasis on final score,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the choice is obvious. Flyers come home from
kindergarten and first grade about signups for soccer or Little
League, which may be the only team sports your town offers.
</P>
<P>
   Benita Fitzgerald Mosley, a gold medalist in the 100-meter
hurdles in the 1984 Olympics, now President of the WSF and Director
of the Olympic Training Centers, says she was lucky that her
parents introduced her to a wide range of activities: ballet,
music, team sports, individual sports.
</P>
<P>
   Though clearly track proved to be her niche, it was not the only
sport she tried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched Olga Korbut and Nadia Comenici in the 1972 Olympics
and I thought it was fun,'' Mosley said. ``I wanted to do that _
even though I was already a head taller (than the gymnasts). So my
parents let me go to middle school gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gymnastics was not my sport; I only wanted to do it because my
friends were. Fortunately, the track coach was also the gymnastics
coach and pulled me out to run track.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosley points out that soccer can be all-consuming because it's
a year-round sport in a lot of cities, which really reduces the
chance for girls to try other sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of parents push their children into single sports too
early,'' says Lopiano. ``It's not too early to start, but choosing
a single sport to specialize in is not a good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopiano notes that children who specialize at young ages often
suffer overuse injuries and burnout. Better to let the kids play
some of everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with every little kid having a gymnastic
experience early on when we all have little bodies,'' Lopiano says.
Soon enough, the athlete herself will discover if she has the wrong
body type.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are over 100 sports out there,'' Lopiano says. ``There's
one you're going to find that's perfect for you, that you have a
passion for. The whole thing is to find that sport.''

AFTER HOSTAGE ORDEAL, WOMAN'S WILL REMAINS UNSHAKEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Va., N.J., Fla.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE EBBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lori Urs did not marry a death row inmate for love, she said
Tuesday. She loved his cause _ so deeply, so passionately, that she
married Joseph Roger O'Dell so that she might lay claim to his
personal belongings and fight to prove his innocence even after his
death.
</P>
<P>
   But her quest to exonerate the Virginia man convicted of a 1985
murder led her to John Nutter, a man she believed had evidence that
could bolster her case. A man now accused of holding Urs and her
daughter hostage in her Chatham, Mass. home last weekend, raping
both, and holding police at bay for 30 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is ironic that in my fight for justice, my own daughter and
I became victims of an atrocious crime,'' Urs said Tuesday, in her
first interview since the siege ended Sunday. ``Yet that will not
deter my future plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining her decision to associate with Nutter, she said, ``I
had no choice but to befriend him and become involved with him as a
witness. He was potentially the answer to Joe's freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying she was only speaking to the Globe to clarify her
motives, Urs maintained that she married O'Dell to gain his last
possessions and search for justice. Before the wedding _ a media
spectacle that drew as much attention as her fight to save his life
_ the two agreed to annul the marriage after his death, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal sacrifice, which drew such skepticism and
criticism, is one that no one should ever have to make in order to
achieve the truth,'' Urs said.
</P>
<P>
   Urs planned to divulge her true intentions this month, before
the September return of DNA test results she hopes will bolster her
belief that O'Dell was innocent. But, she said, she will announce
the results regardless of the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Urs, whose intentions have been the subject of much speculation
since her wedding day on July 23, 1997, paints herself as a
committed believer in an innocent man, and a stunned observer of a
legal system gone awry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally, I notice a great deal of speculation with regard to
my motives and just who I am and what I am all about,'' Urs said.
``I have never felt it necessary to explain myself to the public,
comfortable with the fact that my friends and family were always
aware of the steps I have taken and why.''
</P>
<P>
   Comparing herself to Sister Helen Prejean, the nun who has
fought the death penalty and written the book ``Dead Man Walking,''
Urs said she walked blindly into a criminal justice system where
truths were distorted, the public was misled about evidence, and
the death penalty was applied based on politics.
</P>
<P>
   Her four-year battle to save O'Dell _ which began when she
abandoned an accounting job in New Jersey to take up his cause _
led the 44-year-old law student to gain international attention,
even before the sensational marriage. Her fight attracted the
support of Prejean, Pope John Paul II, the Italian government, and
Mother Teresa, who together fought for the truth, she said _ and
she promised O'Dell to continue fighting even after his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``My marriage to Joseph allowed me to obtain the evidence the
state of Virginia so desperately fought to hide,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Urs said, she obtained all the evidence she wanted _
with the exception of a bloodstained jacket and blood and semen
samples.
</P>
<P>
   Original tests in the 1985 murder case had been called into
question by defense attorneys, and later DNA analysis, conducted
five years after the murder, showed blood on O'Dell's shirt was not
his or the victim's. Prosecutors have maintained they linked the
blood on the jacket worn by O'Dell to murder victim Helen
Schartner. But Urs contends they were inconclusive _ and hopes that
her own tests will prove the blood did not belong to Schartner.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the lab is able to achieve results, the world will finally
know whether Mr. O'Dell was guilty or innocent,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Urs had also obtained blood samples from Nutter, in an effort to
prove it was his blood _ not the victim's _ on O'Dell's jacket. The
night of Schartner's murder, Nutter had allegedly been in a bar
fight, which O'Dell claimed he broke up, leaving blood on his
clothing. Former Virginia commonwealth prosecutor Albert Alberi,
now a district judge in Virginia, countered that O'Dell was bathed
in blood, suggesting far more contact. He also pointed to
additional evidence that bolstered the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lori has turned over every single rock that God put on the
face of the planet to try to relitigate all these things that were
thoroughly looked at,'' Alberi said.
</P>
<P>
   Though she declined to speak in detail of her relationship with
Nutter, Urs maintained she got to know him only as a witness. She
contends that Nutter, a New York state native who was living in
Florida when she found him a few months before O'Dell's execution,
misread her investigatory approaches toward him and followed her to
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   If Nutter fell for her, she said, she had no control over it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I specifically made it clear to him that my goal was to serve
Joseph O'Dell as my client and that I would have nothing to
interfere with the propriety of my work for Mr. O'Dell,'' said Urs.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff at Urs's home last weekend was presaged by another
allegedly violent incident with Nutter last September: Authorities
said he assaulted her, barricaded himself for six hours in her
house, and threatened to burn the house down and kill himself.
While authorities said Urs refused to press charges in that case,
Urs contends she only spoke on Nutter's behalf because he needed
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Urs continued to meet with Nutter, 33, to court his
testimony _ a process she contends is routine for death penalty
investigators. Twice in recent months she met him at the West
Harwich motel where he was living, but she only spoke to him
outdoors, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I had a restraining order and I was frightened,''
she said. ``But my fear is not an appropriate reason to have
someone committed to prison as opposed to an institution where help
could be obtained. Now, I would answer that much differently. Now,
I am frightened and want to make sure he could not be released to
harm us again.''

HAITIAN BOY'S NEW LEASE ON LIFE

   BOSTON _ He sat stoically on his mother's lap at the gate of a
Third World clinic, wearing the sunken face of a defeated man. Aged
tragically beyond his years by burns that fused his chin to his
chest, 6-year-old Michel St. Jean was dirty and nearly dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like beggars they just sat outside the clinic wall,'' said
Mark X. Lowney, an obstetrician who later would help assemble a
rescue team that raced from Haiti's hopeless slums to Boston's
high-tech medical wards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was such a heartbreaking sight,'' Lowney said. ``Michel was
extremely sullen. He looked like an old man, not a little boy. It
was his mother's way of saying: `If you don't help me, I can't do
anything else for my son. He's going to die.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Michel St. Jean didn't perish in his native Haiti. He is
recovering today at the Shriners Burns Hospital, where he has
developed an appetite for beef, a fascination with toys, and a
bemused appreciation for Barney.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the kind of kid who you can easily fall in love with,''
said Marcel Descheneaux, a hospital social worker. ``He can be
very, very sweet, but he has a mind of his own.''
</P>
<P>
   Michel's journey from threshold of death to the prospect of a
healthy future after a series of surgeries begins with the work of
the Haitian Health Foundation, an outreach group based in Norwich,
Conn., founded by Lowney's father, Jeremiah.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1982, the group has provided health care for 200,000
people, treating residents of 85 Haitian villages and immunizing
50,000 children.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the group built the $1.2 million, 27,000-square-foot
clinic in Jeremie, Haiti, where on a steamy morning in June, Lowney
and his father saw Michel and his mother waiting desperately for
help from the visiting American doctors.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Michel's wounds were already 5 months old. He was
severely burned over 25 percent of his body in January of that year
when a kerosene lamp fell from a shelf onto him while he slept on
the dirt floor of the shack he shares with his mother and six
siblings.
</P>
<P>
   He was seared by the petroleum-fed fire. The fingers on his
right hand were gone, leaving him with what doctors described as a
``mitten hand.'' He was unable to lift his arms. He could not turn
his head from side to side. His feet were swollen. He could not
walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a gruesome sight,'' said Mark Lowney, who practices at
Charlton Memorial Hospital. ``On the plane ride home, I said to my
dad, `You know, that kid is going to die down there.' We knew he
was never going to make it in Haiti.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a month of the Lowneys' return to the United States, the
Haitian government had issued the necessary travel documents and
Michel's mother had signed the required power-of-attorney papers.
Last month, the child boarded a US-bound jetliner and within hours
was admitted to Shriners, a 30-bed pediatric hospital where medical
treatment is free.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love taking care of kids like this,'' said Dr. Robert L.
Sheridan, the hospital's assistant chief of staff. ``They have a
bad problem and you know you can help them and that's really fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Physicians delayed the first of Michel's operations for a week,
while they gave him nutrients he would need to tolerate the
anesthetic and to help encourage the healing of his surgical
wounds. His first surgery closed open wounds, using grafted skin
from his thigh, and separated his chin from his chest, enabling
more normal mobility.
</P>
<P>
   ``He feels much better with his wounds closed,'' Sheridan said.
``He can breathe a lot easier. He loves everything with protein in
it _ meat, chicken _ probably because he was so protein depleted.
He's doing great. Everybody loves him.''
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to Michel's room last week, nurses, social
workers, and therapists described a little boy who arrived ``scared
to death'' amid medical technology that is centuries apart from the
conditions in his Haitian village.
</P>
<P>
   But barely three weeks after this arrival, Michel is slowly
learning the importance of sharing in the hospital's well-stocked
toy room. He draws laughter by mimicking his caregivers' English.
He enjoys listening to music through headphones. He cleans his
plate without fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like beef a lot _ and rice,'' Michel said through an
interpreter last week. ``I'd like to go home and see my mom, and
then come back here.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeremiah Lowney, who is Michel's legal guardian in the United
States, said the boy will probably require six to nine months of
treatment before he can return home. Doctors want to restore as
much mobility and function as they can to him before he is
released.
</P>
<P>
   The Lowneys hopes to raise $10,000 to pay for a prosthetic hand
for Michel and to help build a small house for his family near the
foundation's clinic in Haiti.
</P>

NEW DEBATE FLARES OVER JEFFERSON'S VIEW OF CHURCH AND STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is only three paragraphs long, but among the most scrutinized
letters in American history. And nearly 200 years after it was
penned, controversy still exists over the author's intent.
</P>
<P>
   The much-disputed letter is one of Thomas Jefferson's more
famous and influential writings, primarily because of eight words
he included in his correspondence to a group of Connecticut
Baptists.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, citing the religion clause in the First Amendment,
advocated the erection of ``a wall of separation between church and
state.'' The phrase has reverberated across US history. It has been
used by courts and civil libertarians to keep government and
religion from commingling, much to the dismay of conservative
religious advocates.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict over church and state has flared anew in the
usually staid confines of the Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a major and highly regarded exhibit on the role of
religion in early American life, the library released a paper
rejecting the common legal interpretations of Jefferson's letter.
</P>
<P>
   In the paper, James Hutson, chief of the Library's manuscript
division, asserts that Jefferson's letter was ``never conceived to
be a statement of fundamental principles; it was meant to be a
political manifesto, nothing more.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutson's statements were immediately latched onto by the
Christian Coalition and other Christian-right groups who have long
sought to knock Jefferson off his constitutional pedestal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a liberal myth that Jefferson intended his words to be
used as justification for expelling religious expression from the
public square,'' Randy Tate, the Christian Coalition's executive
director, said in a recent news release.
</P>
<P>
   But a group of leading US historians have fired back at the
Library of Congress, chastizing Hutson for sloppy scholarship. The
weight of historical evidence, including the famous letter to the
Connecticut Baptists, makes it absolutely clear, these historians
argue, that Jefferson fervently believed that government should
stay away from religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The historical record makes clear that he used his commitment
to religious freedom with utmost deliberation in order to set forth
both his philosophy and his view of public policy,'' stated the
letter signed by 24 historians at various universities across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Hutson's conclusions are based partly on a new FBI analysis of
Jefferson's letter that restored words the author of the
Declaration of Independence had crossed out in drafting his
correspondence to the Danbury (Conn.) Baptist Association.
</P>
<P>
   A comparision of the unedited and final versions of the letters,
Hutson claims, shows that Jefferson was trying to mollify political
allies in New England.
</P>
<P>
   These allies viewed suspiciously any type of government support
for religion as an attempt to reimpose a British-style monarchy on
the United States. Religious persecution, after all, was one of the
main reasons many colonists fled Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson also crossed out a portion of an earlier draft in
which he discussed why he did not even advocate the kinds of
devotional practices, such as days of thanksgiving, that were
common then in many states.
</P>
<P>
   The unedited draft of the letter lends crucial insight into
Jefferson's motivation, Hutson asserts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted his political partisans to know that he opposed
proclaiming fasts and thanksgivings not because he was irreligious,
but because he refused to continue a British practice that was an
offense to republicanism,'' Hutson writes.
</P>
<P>
   But the letter written by the two dozen US historians says
Hutson should have submitted the FBI analysis of Jefferson's letter
for independent scholarly review. The historians also question how
Hutson could believe that simply comparing the unedited and final
versions of the letters could yield such deep insights into
Jefferson's thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Hutson has defended his paper by saying the FBI analysis
contributes to discussions about the significance of Jefferson's
letter.
</P>
<P>
   But Robert S. Alley, professor emeritus of humanities at the
University of Richmond and an authority on church-state law and
history, says he ``categorically disagrees'' with Hutson's paper
and believes the Library of Congress should not try and present it
as ``settled fact.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout his career Jefferson was antagonistic to Christian
faith and did not believe that Jesus was God,'' Alley said. ``A lot
of people don't like Jefferson's views on religion and somehow they
think that if they can undermine Jefferson, they can debunk what
the courts have been saying on church and state for many years.''

Religion Notes
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Governor Mike Leavitt of Utah, a Mormon, stirred debate last
week when he said cases of human or civil rights abuses by
polygamists should be prosecuted, but that the practice itself
might be protected by the religious freedom clause of the First
Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Alleged victims of polygamy blasted the Republican governor, and
at a news conference last week outside Leavitt's home demanded that
Utah officials more vigorously prosecute polygamists. Polygamy is
most closely associated with the early history of the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. But the practice was banned by
the church in 1890 and is outlawed in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some religion scholars estimate that there are about
30,000 polygamists nationwide, many of whom belong to splinter
Mormon groups who reject the main church's ban on the practice.
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt's comments on polygamy came in connection with a court
case involving John Daniel Kingston, a member of a polygamist
group, who has been charged with child abuse. He is accused of
beating his 16-year-old daughter with a belt after she refused to
submit to an arranged marriage with Kingston's brother.

   WEST HORSLEY, England _ In late June, I stood on the front porch
of my mom and dad's place an hour south of Dallas and marveled at
the old plastic thermometer.
</P>
<P>
   It reported the temperature to be 112 degrees. I would have
thought it hotter. The heat was such that the wood of the porch
smelled as if it would soon burst into flames. Much of what Dad had
planted over the years to civilize their patch of prairie grasses
and mesquite trees was surrendering its last moisture, becoming
straw-colored and brittle. His organic garden, a source of pride
for a man who spent too many years living in cities, was barren.
</P>
<P>
   Inside their little home, the air-conditioners were working
frightfully hard to create an oasis of cool where a couple of older
people might survive, so long as they kept the doors and windows
sealed and ventured outside only moderately. They might as have
well been space travelers trapped in their spaceship on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Tempered somewhat by altitude and longitude, the heat also had
visited my home in Atlanta, where my garden was only slightly
better off than dad's. The tomatoes and greens I'd planted couldn't
seem to get enough water to provide much of a salad. The
honeysuckle planted on the arbor in May didn't make it to July.
</P>
<P>
   So imagine the relief of arriving to this place, where a cool
spell is caressing an already mild climate. The garden at Meadows
-- that's the name of the house we leased south of London; we don't
use anything so impersonal as street numbers in West Horsley _ is
lush and brilliant with purples, reds and whites. The grass is
thick, soft and green. My apple trees are heavy with fruit and the
berries are making the birds crazy.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Sunday, it was sunny with a high of 73 degrees. I
sat on the patio reading tacky English newspapers and reveling in
the glory of this early fall or late spring or whatever it is.
Really, it's as if the weather gods have knitted spring to fall
without using a summer at all.
</P>
<P>
   In the evening, you need a jacket -- a fashion necessity anyway
to a man of a certain age beset with the humbling combination of
vanity and pudginess. At night, you need a light blanket.
</P>
<P>
   I feel some guilt, but not much, when I see stories in the
London press about the miseries of the American broil. (Am I crazy
or do I detect a suggestion by the writers that the uppity
colonists at last are getting their due?)
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the English television weather ``Kens'' and ``Barbies,''
like their American cousins, are putting on their grim faces to
report their own weather disaster: The Missing Summer. No one can
find it anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   I gather that this is bad news to people who pass all those
drizzly months of leaden skies longing desperately for the heat, if
you can call it that, of summer. People here are talking about how
the weather has damaged the British tourism industry and generally
made everyone cranky.
</P>
<P>
   In record numbers, Britons are fleeing to the warmth of southern
France, Spain and Florida, where they can frolic on the beaches,
exposing their alarmingly unprepared white bodies to searing
ultraviolet sunrays. (I wonder if there's a market for a travel
package to sunny, exotic central Texas?)
</P>
<P>
   Well, they can have it.
</P>
<P>
   I'll remain in the natural air-conditioning, testing the various
ales and beers you can buy in the little store down Ockham Road
from Meadows in a quest for a regular brand.
</P>
<P>
   And I'll remain to watch the bloom. My soul needs to see at
least one garden come to full flower this summer.

CRIME RATES ARE FALLING, BUT THE PRISON POPULATION IS RISING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If I told you that my prescription for making America a bit
safer from crime was to lock up every blessed soul living in Maine
and New Hampshire, you'd think I was nutty.
</P>
<P>
   But official government policy in this country has almost that
many people behind bars this morning, more than 1.7 million. And if
you throw in all the employees who report to prison or jail every
day, the guards, cooks, nurses and administrators, the total of
Americans who spend their day inside prison walls is more than the
combined populations of Maine and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Now for more news: The prison and jail population will probably
top two million in time for 2000. Sure, crime rates are falling;
but prison and jail populations are rising. How so? Longer
sentences. Since Ronald Reagan's tough talk on crime proved
politically popular in the mid-'80s, your typical inmate has had
five months tacked on to his time in the jug, from an average of 20
months to 25 months.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask yourself: Have you ever seen a politician brag that
he's for shorter sentences? Easier time? More parole and probation?
Have you forgotten what George Bush's hatchetmen did to Michael
Dukakis over Willie Horton in the presidential election 10 years
ago? No politician has forgotten that lesson.
</P>
<P>
   So sentences get longer, rhetoric gets harsher, and candidates
outdo themselves in bragging how tough they'll be on miscreants.
Remember Bill Weld riding into office promising to introduce his
prisoners to ``the joy of breaking rocks?'' It's still a trend.
</P>
<P>
   And that average sentence gets longer each month, with longer
minimums, three-strikes-and-you're-out, stricter sentencing rules
that prevent judges from weighing a defendant's youth, IQ,
mitigating circumstance or general stupidity in easing prison
stays. We are also cracking down on parole violators: Nearly
one-third of all inmates are back where they are because they did
something really stupid all over again.
</P>
<P>
   You thought our hottest growth industry was something in the
computer line? Try prison construction. All through the '90's, our
prison population expanded by about 64,000 per year. That means
every month, we need new cells for 5,350 men _ they are
overwhelmingly men. That's a roof, a bed, a barred door, a toilet,
three squares and medical care, plus the custodial charges, for a
net increase of 175 men per day.
</P>
<P>
   You are paying for all this. You are hiring, as taxpayers, on
average, every day of the year, weekends and holidays included, a
fresh crew of 175 prisoners, whom you will now have to feed, cloth,
medicate, guard and entertain, plus another crew to watch over them
and make sure they don't leave their new home before their
25-months-and-geowing, on average, is up.
</P>
<P>
   Make sense to you? Do you feel safer because going on two
million of your fellow Americans are locked up? In many cases, yes,
sure, we know there are dangerous people who deserve to be locked
away. The most violent and felonious, sure, no problem, keep them
tucked away.
</P>
<P>
   But why do we have so many more prisoners per capita than any
other industrial nation, save Russia? That is the only country with
more inmates per head than we have. Our rate of incarcerating 645
out of every 100,000 citizens is six to 10 times higher than the
rest of the so-called civilized world, save Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Sound bites elect politicians, and three-strikes-and-you're-out
sounds satisfactory after the local TV station zips up its audience
share with live shots from the latest gruesome crime scene. But 19
out of 20 of those prison inmates chilling in noisy, crowded,
understaffed, over-brutalized prisons come out, typically after 25
months of soul-deadening punishment.
</P>
<P>
   And they come back to live in our midst, and try to pick up
where they left off. Some go straight. Some have the gumption and
IQ to get jobs, to overcome the stigma of a prison record, to renew
family life, to get on with living. A lot don't. They were drunk or
high when they did what they did to get in trouble in the first
place, and most prisoners have done a lot more wrong than what they
got sentenced for.
</P>
<P>
   Drink and drugs gave a lot of them the false courage they needed
to try something really crooked. And if they're a little light in
the IQ department, as many prisoners are, if they had broken
families, and lousy schooling, and a predilection for dope or booze
or violent behavior, then over they go, and in they go. But every
other industrial nation, save one, has devised smoother, calmer,
more efficient and less costly ways of dealing with malefactors.
</P>
<P>
   Shorter, swifter sentences, more counseling and oversight on the
street, intensive job-skill training and maximization of religious
and psychological help, teaching reading and writing and basic
social skills, all these would help. Prison too often makes hard
and brutal men harder and more brutal. I write a similar column
every summer when the numbers come out, usually picking two states
whose population mirrors that in prison. Next year, I'm afraid, I
may have to toss in Rhode Island.

   JERUSALEM _ The waitress could see that my parents and I were
novices.
</P>
<P>
   Huddled with a few Israelis in the bathroom corridor of a
downtown sandwich shop, we waited for word that the suspicious
object down the street had been deemed harmless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this your first time?'' said our server with a big,
friendly smile.
</P>
<P>
   Such friendly smiles might be a rarity in this tense city, but
bomb scares are not.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, we were allowed back to our table. Israeli bomb
specialists were putting their armor vests back into their van.
</P>
<P>
   After a year as Cox Newspapers' Middle East correspondent, I
realized, during this visit from my parents, that I'm getting used
to conditions that most Americans would find unnerving and most
Israelis barely notice.
</P>
<P>
   Police sometimes deal with hundreds of bomb scares a day after
terror attacks.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen a bomb squad seal off a pedestrian promenade and, with
ropes, carefully tug apart a mysterious paper box only to find a
cake inside. The day after a birthday party for a colleague's
child, the bomb squad blew up an unfamiliar object found in the
garbage -- a beat up pinata.
</P>
<P>
   Entering any mall or movie theater, guards search your shoulder
bag. They take your name and license plate number when parking at
the mall.
</P>
<P>
   Any doubt that this is necessary was erased a few months ago.
Israeli police said Palestinian terrorists had cased a Jerusalem
mall, passing through security with heavy bags of nails to test the
prospects of returning someday with nail bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Suicide bombers killed 21 Israelis in attacks in July and
September of last year.
</P>
<P>
   These attacks rattle the Israelis, cause breaks in peace talks
and can unsettle the region. The omnipresent security may actually
relieve tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do we accept it, but we welcome it,'' said Rachel
Levy-Shiff, psychology professor at Tel Aviv's Bar-Ilan University.
</P>
<P>
   Suicide bombers have walked right past guards on the way to
their attacks. But Levy-Shiff said that security, even if it might
be an ``illusion,'' still makes Israelis feel better.
</P>
<P>
   Airline passengers here face questioning about who packed their
bags, who they met in Israel and whether they know any Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   It can take just a few minutes, or can lead to an item-by-item
inspection of luggage by large, multi-lingual, teams of young
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis or even American Jews often face just perfunctory
security reviews.
</P>
<P>
   When an Israeli Jew walked past a security ring in 1995 and
killed Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, police were accused of having
a ``blind spot'' toward the threat from their own people.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Palestinians will often be separated from the crowd
at the airport or on the streets for hours of questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Their resentment at this harsh treatment reminds me of
African-Americans in the United States who are needlessly hassled
by local police.
</P>
<P>
   My brushes with security have been understandable. An army
patrol flagged down my car and searched it as I drove away from the
family of a Hamas bomb-maker who had recently been killed.
</P>
<P>
   I've had to display articles in my lap-top computer to prove
that my travels in Arab areas were for journalism.
</P>
<P>
   These checks can be a nuisance. They are not going to eliminate
terrorism. But, on the way into the airplane or the movies, they
can also be a little reassuring.

 &HT;    UPSCALE NEVIS SET TO SPLIT FROM BIG SISTER ST. KITTS
 &HT;    With NEVIS-BOX-$ADV09.
 &HT;    For Use Sunday, Aug. 9 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By SHELLEY EMLING

<P>
   MIAMI _ Covering just 36 square miles, the island of Nevis is a
mere speck on the map of the Caribbean Sea. With only two large
grocery stores -- and no major airports or cruise ship docks --
it's the kind of place where straggling goats often stop traffic.
</P>
<P>
   But despite its small size, some 6,000 voters will decide in a
referendum on Monday(Aug. 10) whether to secede from Nevis' big
sister, St. Kitts, located just two miles of water away.
</P>
<P>
   If two-thirds of those voting say yes, Nevis will become the
hemisphere's tiniest -- and one of the world's smallest --
independent nations, boasting a population of scarcely 11,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just need to go our separate ways,'' said Mark Brantley,
who chairs the Nevis Constitutional Committee and is a staunch
proponent of secession.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if we're involved in a limping marriage,'' he said.
``We may be together but we're not going anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The British first united the islands -- along with nearby
Anguilla -- more than a century ago. But Anguilla left the cluster
in 1967, before independence, and remains a British dependent
territory today.
</P>
<P>
   Nevis reluctantly joined St. Kitts in a federation after the two
islands won independence from Britain in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   But Nevisians have since complained of being treated like a
neglected stepchild instead of a valued sibling.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-secessionists say that Nevis contributes 38 percent of the
federation's tax revenue, but only receives 21 percent of
government spending. As a result, they say Nevis has a deficient
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, St. Kitts enjoys the country's only
international airport and a deep-water channel for cruise ships.
</P>
<P>
   ``They treat us like second-class citizens,'' groused Malcolm
Guishard, Nevis' deputy premier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nevis wants to determine its own destiny,'' he said. ``We
don't need them telling us what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Rising to a volcanic peak, Nevis was named ``Las Nieves'' --
Spanish for snow -- by Christopher Columbus because the island's
summit, shrouded in white clouds and mist, reminded him of the
snow-capped mountains in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Today the tourist-rich island is dominated by the posh Four
Seasons Resort Hotel, and has become a playground for the rich and
famous, including Woody Allen, Sylvester Stallone and Robert
DeNiro. With more than 700 employees, the Four Seasons is the
island's largest employer.
</P>
<P>
   The destination garnered even more cachet a few years ago when
Princess Diana vacationed in Nevis, accompanied by Princes William
and Harry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of tourists shoots up every year, and there are new
hotels going up all the time, so Nevis has had great success with
this industry; more than St. Kitts has had,'' said Kenneth
Williams, who owns the Nevis Observer, the island's weekly
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   But besides tourism, there's also a $1.9 million-a-year offshore
business in Nevis, where 10,000 international business corporations
(IBCs) are registered, the majority of which are asset-protection
trusts.
</P>
<P>
   It was when the St. Kitts-Nevis government introduced new
financial regulations a few years ago to gain greater control of
investments and offshore business services in Nevis that the move
for secession really took off.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the economy of St. Kitts is driven mostly by a
troubled sugar industry, a smattering of assembly plants, and a
tourism industry that is less upscale than in Nevis, where some
hotel rooms fetch $500 a night.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, St. Kitts has been plagued by drug-related crime in
recent years, further troubling image-conscious Nevis, which prides
itself on its number of churches -- 60.
</P>
<P>
   On July 31, the U.S. State Department reported that an accused
drug trafficker, Charles ``Little Nut'' Miller, threatened to
randomly kill U.S. veterinary students in St. Kitts if he lost his
fight against extradition.
</P>
<P>
   He and two other alleged drug traffickers believed to be in St.
Kitts are all under U.S. indictment for smuggling cocaine into the
United States, and a court in St. Kitts is now considering a U.S.
extradition request for them.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have even urged Americans traveling to St. Kitts
to take precautions, along with the 250 students and 50 faculty
members at Ross Veterinary University.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the disparities and disagreements between the two
islands, Nevis' referendum on secession has raised concerns in an
era that has countries in the Caribbean working toward closer
economic and political integration.
</P>
<P>
   In a strongly worded statement, Kenny Anthony, the chairman of
the 15-nation Caribbean Community, or Caricom, said the regional
trade and political group was disappointed over the planned vote.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony said he was worried about ``the undesirable
fragmentation of the Caribbean.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement from the U.S. State Department, spokesman James
Rubin expressed hope that the voters of Nevis will preserve their
historical ties to St. Kitts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maintaining the federation would be more compatible with the
trend toward greater regional integration, with all its
considerable benefits and advantages,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   St. Kitts-Nevis Prime Minister Denzil Douglas also has lamented
the vote in Nevis, but said he'll do nothing to undermine the
effort to secede.
</P>
<P>
   He blames a ``flawed'' 1983 constitution for fomenting
discontent and separation.
</P>
<P>
   That constitution provides not only for 11 elected federal
parliamentarians -- eight from St. Kitts and three from Nevis --
but also for a five-member Nevis Island Assembly that has
substantial autonomy over local Nevis affairs. The federal
government has its seat in Basseterre, in St. Kitts.
</P>
<P>
   The constitution includes a provision that allows Nevis to
secede unilaterally, and the Nevis Island Assembly voted
unanimously last October to approve the secession vote.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's hard to predict the outcome, there's a growing
sense that secession will succeed. In a non-binding vote in 1974,
about 80 percent of Nevisians favored secession.
</P>
<P>
   If pro-secessionists do succeed Monday, Nevis would become an
independent nation within the next year or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very ready to end the abuse and neglect,'' Brantley
said bluntly. ``The relationship has always been an uneasy one.''

   WEST HORSLEY, England _ In late June, I stood on the front porch
of my mom and dad's place an hour south of Dallas and marveled at
the old plastic thermometer.
</P>
<P>
   It reported the temperature to be 112 degrees. I would have
thought it hotter. The heat was such that the wood of the porch
smelled as if it would soon burst into flames. Much of what Dad had
planted over the years to civilize their patch of prairie grasses
and mesquite trees was surrendering its last moisture, becoming
straw-colored and brittle. His organic garden, a source of pride
for a man who spent too many years living in cities, was barren.
</P>
<P>
   Inside their little home, the air-conditioners were working
frightfully hard to create an oasis of cool where a couple of older
people might survive, so long as they kept the doors and windows
sealed and ventured outside only moderately. They might as have
well been space travelers trapped in their spaceship on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Tempered somewhat by altitude and longitude, the heat also had
visited my home in Atlanta, where my garden was only slightly
better off than dad's. The tomatoes and greens I'd planted couldn't
seem to get enough water to provide much of a salad. The
honeysuckle planted on the arbor in May didn't make it to July.
</P>
<P>
   So imagine the relief of arriving to this place, where a cool
spell is caressing an already mild climate. The garden at Meadows
-- that's the name of the house we leased south of London; we don't
use anything so impersonal as street numbers in West Horsley _ is
lush and brilliant with purples, reds and whites. The grass is
thick, soft and green. My apple trees are heavy with fruit and the
berries are making the birds crazy.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Sunday, it was sunny with a high of 73 degrees. I
sat on the patio reading tacky English newspapers and reveling in
the glory of this early fall or late spring or whatever it is.
Really, it's as if the weather gods have knitted spring to fall
without using a summer at all.
</P>
<P>
   In the evening, you need a jacket -- a fashion necessity anyway
to a man of a certain age beset with the humbling combination of
vanity and pudginess. At night, you need a light blanket.
</P>
<P>
   I feel some guilt, but not much, when I see stories in the
London press about the miseries of the American broil. (Am I crazy
or do I detect a suggestion by the writers that the uppity
colonists at last are getting their due?)
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the English television weather ``Kens'' and ``Barbies,''
like their American cousins, are putting on their grim faces to
report their own weather disaster: The Missing Summer. No one can
find it anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   I gather that this is bad news to people who pass all those
drizzly months of leaden skies longing desperately for the heat, if
you can call it that, of summer. People here are talking about how
the weather has damaged the British tourism industry and generally
made everyone cranky.
</P>
<P>
   In record numbers, Britons are fleeing to the warmth of southern
France, Spain and Florida, where they can frolic on the beaches,
exposing their alarmingly unprepared white bodies to searing
ultraviolet sunrays. (I wonder if there's a market for a travel
package to sunny, exotic central Texas?)
</P>
<P>
   Well, they can have it.
</P>
<P>
   I'll remain in the natural air-conditioning, testing the various
ales and beers you can buy in the little store down Ockham Road
from Meadows in a quest for a regular brand.
</P>
<P>
   And I'll remain to watch the bloom. My soul needs to see at
least one garden come to full flower this summer.

CIVILITY RULES IN THE CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR'S RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO -- Necessity, the mother of invention, can also be a
swell referee.
</P>
<P>
   When Dan Lungren, Republican attorney general, and Gray Davis,
Democratic lieutenant governor, met in a gubernatorial debate here,
the conventions of journalism demanded focus on their differing
ideologies. But their agreement on a code of conduct was more
important than their disagreements.
</P>
<P>
   In the quick-hit world of hired-gun politics, the major
candidates in this year's most important election have agreed, in
Lungren's words, to make the candidates ``responsible for the tenor
of our own campaigns.'' These tough, savvy, self-confident
politicians made news by agreeing to restore integrity to politics.
</P>
<P>
   The debate at the San Diego Convention Center was cosponsored by
the California Manufacturers Association and the AFL-CIO state
labor federation, an indication that the state is united in its
distaste for mudslinging. Thus, the candidates' ambitions have
driven them to higher ground.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Davis likened his opponent in a senatorial primary,
Dianne Feinstein, to Leona Helmsley, the New York hotelier.
``Helmsley is in jail; Feinstein wants to be a senator,'' a Davis
ad said, comparing Helmsley's conviction for federal income tax
evasion with a civil suit by a state election commission against
Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   The backlash almost ended his political career as Feinstein beat
Davis by 25 points. This year, he won the June 2 gubernatorial
primary against two multimillionaires with the slogan, ``Experience
Money Can't Buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Lungren has lagged in the polls. He needed a bold
move and was ready when asked, ``Will you pledge tonight not to use
attack ads in the coming months?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The way to eliminate the whole question about negative ads is
to say: `We will not engage in any negative ads on television,
radio or direct mail, any negative or comparative ads, unless the
subject has first been broached in face-to-face confrontation,'''
he said. ``That means that I would have an opportunity to respond
to anything Gray had to say and he would have an opportunity to
respond to anything I had to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said, ``I agree with the idea'' and when pressed, added,
``I am going to abide by the principle. Dan and I are going to be
on the same page and we will agree to the same rules.''
</P>
<P>
   A typical ad indicts an opponent by inflating a peccadillo.
Thus, an overdue library book becomes ``Nightmare on Elm Street.''
Surprise is essential, as opposition research blends furtively with
polling. By removing the Pearl Harbor aspect of most negative ads,
Davis and Lungren shattered the pattern. They agreed to become
their own focus group.
</P>
<P>
   After the debate, each candidate also became his own spin
doctor. ``Mr. Lungren is a decent person who is willing to take
away a woman's right to choose,'' Davis said, stressing what
Lungren called ``divisive liberal wedge issues.'' As for their code
of conduct, Davis said, `` I'm going to run my campaign like I did
in the primary where I got pretty high marks for being fair and
being positive. I do like this concept of raising any problems you
might have with your opponent in a debate before it goes up in a
commercial and I intend to abide by that. I intend to run a
positive and thoughtful campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Lungren said, ``I'm a mainstream conservative and he's a
traditional liberal. I think people began to see that here today
... There is a choice here worth making. I salute Gray for agreeing
to five debates. I hope we can talk him into even more.'' The
number, Davis noted, exceeds the debate total ``in the last five
elections.''
</P>
<P>
   They meet again in Fresno Aug. 18. Will the new code last? Davis
and Lungren are not naive. They are trying out this idea for
practical, self-interested reasons, which may make this
nonaggression pact more reliable and no less remarkable. In
politics, necessity can be midwife to virtue.

   JERUSALEM _ The waitress could see that my parents and I were
novices.
</P>
<P>
   Huddled with a few Israelis in the bathroom corridor of a
downtown sandwich shop, we waited for word that the suspicious
object down the street had been deemed harmless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this your first time?'' said our server with a big,
friendly smile.
</P>
<P>
   Such friendly smiles might be a rarity in this tense city, but
bomb scares are not.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, we were allowed back to our table. Israeli bomb
specialists were putting their armor vests back into their van.
</P>
<P>
   After a year as Cox Newspapers' Middle East correspondent, I
realized, during this visit from my parents, that I'm getting used
to conditions that most Americans would find unnerving and most
Israelis barely notice.
</P>
<P>
   Police sometimes deal with hundreds of bomb scares a day after
terror attacks.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen a bomb squad seal off a pedestrian promenade and, with
ropes, carefully tug apart a mysterious paper box only to find a
cake inside. The day after a birthday party for a colleague's
child, the bomb squad blew up an unfamiliar object found in the
garbage -- a beat up pinata.
</P>
<P>
   Entering any mall or movie theater, guards search your shoulder
bag. They take your name and license plate number when parking at
the mall.
</P>
<P>
   Any doubt that this is necessary was erased a few months ago.
Israeli police said Palestinian terrorists had cased a Jerusalem
mall, passing through security with heavy bags of nails to test the
prospects of returning someday with nail bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Suicide bombers killed 21 Israelis in attacks in July and
September of last year.
</P>
<P>
   These attacks rattle the Israelis, cause breaks in peace talks
and can unsettle the region. The omnipresent security may actually
relieve tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do we accept it, but we welcome it,'' said Rachel
Levy-Shiff, psychology professor at Tel Aviv's Bar-Ilan University.
</P>
<P>
   Suicide bombers have walked right past guards on the way to
their attacks. But Levy-Shiff said that security, even if it might
be an ``illusion,'' still makes Israelis feel better.
</P>
<P>
   Airline passengers here face questioning about who packed their
bags, who they met in Israel and whether they know any Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   It can take just a few minutes, or can lead to an item-by-item
inspection of luggage by large, multi-lingual, teams of young
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis or even American Jews often face just perfunctory
security reviews.
</P>
<P>
   When an Israeli Jew walked past a security ring in 1995 and
killed Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, police were accused of having
a ``blind spot'' toward the threat from their own people.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Palestinians will often be separated from the crowd
at the airport or on the streets for hours of questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Their resentment at this harsh treatment reminds me of
African-Americans in the United States who are needlessly hassled
by local police.
</P>
<P>
   My brushes with security have been understandable. An army
patrol flagged down my car and searched it as I drove away from the
family of a Hamas bomb-maker who had recently been killed.
</P>
<P>
   I've had to display articles in my lap-top computer to prove
that my travels in Arab areas were for journalism.
</P>
<P>
   These checks can be a nuisance. They are not going to eliminate
terrorism. But, on the way into the airplane or the movies, they
can also be a little reassuring.

'HALLOWEEN: H20' SUFFERS FROM TIRED BLOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
HALLOWEEN: H20 
Directed by: Steve Miner 
Screenplay by: Robert Zappia, Matt Greenberg 
Starring: Jamie Lee Curtis, Adam Arkin, Josh Hartnett, Michelle
Williams, Janet Leigh, Adam Hann-Byrd, Jodi Lyn O'Keefe, LL Cool J 
Running time: 91 minutes 
Rated: R (terror, violence/gore, language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Halloween'' gave Jamie Lee Curtis the scream queen role that
launched her career in 1978, so it's only fair that she should
return to lay the franchise to rest in ``Halloween: H20.'' Even
though the film's serial killer, Michael Myers, was never one to
just lie around in a body bag, the alarming lack of anything
resembling real energy in this new go-round will ensure that this
sequel, kitchen knives and all, will transport the Halloweenies
into deserved oblivion.

   The fact is that ``Halloween'' and its many clones have thrown
so many slasher images across so many screens that they simply
don't have the shock value they once had, and they're too tired to
deliver much campy fun, either. This new recycling doesn't find
much new spin to put on the formula as it focuses on Curtis's
Laurie Strode 20 years later, a traumatized alcoholic wreck who has
faked her death and holed up in a California private school with a
new identity and a 17-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Even before she leads her English class through Mary Shelley's
``Frankenstein,'' with particular emphasis on Victor Frankenstein's
need to confront his monster, we know it's only a matter of time
until she'll be tangling with Michael again. Sure enough, he comes
staggering in wearing the mask (originally a Star Trek mask of
William Shatner painted white and stripped of its hair), walking
the walk, and wielding the knife.
</P>
<P>
   It has become a convention of teen horror movies that the
victims never turn lights on when they enter dark rooms and that
the ones with sex on their minds usually pay for it with slit
throats. This one at least genuflects to its inspiration,
Hitchcock's ``Psycho,'' most notably by casting Janet Leigh,
Curtis's real mother, as a maternal staff member who tries to
mother the distraught Laurie before driving off in a Ford Fairlane
reminiscent of the one Leigh's character drove in ``Psycho'' before
bad fortune showered down upon her.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the film just seems to go through the motions,
sometimes with surprising sloppiness, as when one character, seen
lying motionless in a pool of his own blood, reappears fully
energized and says the bullet only grazed him. Campiness peaks in a
fingertip-to-fingertip moment out of Michelangelo by way of
``E.T.'' Still, what we've got here is mostly a dreary reminder
that ``Scream'' and ``Scream 2'' were better ``Halloween'' sequels
than ``Halloween: H20.''

SHORT STORIES LONG ON RESONANCE

THE COAST OF GOOD INTENTIONS 
By Michael Byers 
Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, 163 pp., $12 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stories by Michael Byers have won prizes, appeared in
prestigious anthologies, made as much stir as a literary
achievement in the genre of the short story can these days. Byers
is young _ 28 _ and very good, which is rare enough. He writes out
of his own experience: All the stories in his first collection,
``The Coast of Good Intentions,'' are set in his native Pacific
Northwest, which he evokes with exactitude and affection. Certain
themes recur _ loss, loneliness, recovery _ but Byers does not
repeat himself; only two of the eight stories in the book are
similar to each other. And his experience includes empathy. His
characters are young and old; male and female; straight and gay;
literate and uneducated. All of them, even the walk-ons, are
independent and convincing. And none of them is a 28-year-old
writer, convinced of the uniqueness of his talent and of his pain.
This sets Byers apart from most young writers not only in his
generation but in previous ones.
</P>
<P>
   Byers takes his time; several stories take 30 pages to unfold.
One is about a family preparing to take a two-week vacation in
Australia, where the narrator/father comes from. The trip has to be
postponed when 6-year-old Nadia falls ill and has to go to the
hospital; her illness becomes a test for the family, considered
both as individuals and as a complex interactive organism.
</P>
<P>
   Another story concerns a young man who works for a computer-game
company, where he has invented perils and rescues that have not
prepared him for the loss of his wife to bone cancer. In another
story Andie, a teenager whose father has died in World War II,
comes to live with an aunt who seems a symbol of resolute feminine
independence. The years pass and Andie and her aunt gradually
exchange roles _ the story is called ``A Fair Trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Byers's stories are disarmingly direct and intimate, yet
they also represent considerable technical accomplishment; there
are complex patterns of mirrors and receding reverberations. In the
story about the child's illness, the father recalls a favorite
boys' adventure book of his childhood, which his son is reading and
his bedridden daughter is listening to; the adventure is
extravagant yet clear-cut, unlike the adventure the family is now
undergoing. Sex is an important part of the story about the young
widower, who was quite a Lothario in his adolescence and during his
college years. He and his late wife once attended a performance of
``Don Giovanni'' where Leporello's catalog of the libertine's
conquests seemed pertinent; in his job in customer relations, the
narrator must deal with an 11-year-old who doesn't want help with
the computer game as much as he wants to talk dirty. A crisis comes
when the widower's mother-in-law brushes provocatively past.
</P>
<P>
   Even the shorter stories are resonant and complicated. A retired
couple entertain a visitor from their youth who's gone over the
edge; two people from different worlds in high school find common
ground decades later; a crazy cousin disappears, leaving everything
in his house upside down; a sagging, middle-aged divorced man
living in the past finds a present and maybe the hope of a future;
a dramatist watches rehearsals for his play about Thomas Alva
Edison and begins to discover Edison in himself, and his play
beginning to replicate itself in his life.
</P>
<P>
   This last story, ``Wizard,'' may be a little too tricky for its
own good, though it is full of interesting Edisonian lore we didn't
learn in school. (In his notebook, Edison wrote, ``My wife
Popsy-Wopsy can't invent.'') Most of the time Byers writes so well
that the writing becomes transparent, so the reader is surprised
when he stops to apply touches of literature. On his first date
with his wife-to-be, the young Lothario finds himself listening to
Casals play Bach's suites for unaccompanied cello. ``To his
surprise he liked the creaking and groaning of the cello, like a
ship tossing at sea. Evelyn didn't sit next to him; she leaned
against one end of the sofa, watching his face. She hummed, her big
goofy teeth resting on her bottom lip, and Martin wanted her: her
thighs in her jeans, her solid upper arms heavy in her green
sweater. The cello creaked on, dust popping in the seams of vinyl.
She held her finger up as the music climbed, joyfully; put her palm
down and looked sad as the music descended and become somber again,
chestnut-dark, confined. `All right,' she said, when the record
ended, `You can go now.''' That's good, too good, and just plain
awful.
</P>
<P>
   But when Byers is at his best, as he is most of the time in this
volume, it's patronizing to call him promising. He's there already,
and what you remember is not his writing, but his people, how they
feel, and how they get along with the business of living, something
that Byers understands so well.

HAITIAN BOY'S NEW LEASE ON LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He sat stoically on his mother's lap at the gate of a
Third World clinic, wearing the sunken face of a defeated man. Aged
tragically beyond his years by burns that fused his chin to his
chest, 6-year-old Michel St. Jean was dirty and nearly dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like beggars they just sat outside the clinic wall,'' said
Mark X. Lowney, an obstetrician who later would help assemble a
rescue team that raced from Haiti's hopeless slums to Boston's
high-tech medical wards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was such a heartbreaking sight,'' Lowney said. ``Michel was
extremely sullen. He looked like an old man, not a little boy. It
was his mother's way of saying: `If you don't help me, I can't do
anything else for my son. He's going to die.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Michel St. Jean didn't perish in his native Haiti. He is
recovering today at the Shriners Burns Hospital, where he has
developed an appetite for beef, a fascination with toys, and a
bemused appreciation for Barney.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the kind of kid who you can easily fall in love with,''
said Marcel Descheneaux, a hospital social worker. ``He can be
very, very sweet, but he has a mind of his own.''
</P>
<P>
   Michel's journey from threshold of death to the prospect of a
healthy future after a series of surgeries begins with the work of
the Haitian Health Foundation, an outreach group based in Norwich,
Conn., founded by Lowney's father, Jeremiah.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1982, the group has provided health care for 200,000
people, treating residents of 85 Haitian villages and immunizing
50,000 children.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the group built the $1.2 million, 27,000-square-foot
clinic in Jeremie, Haiti, where on a steamy morning in June, Lowney
and his father saw Michel and his mother waiting desperately for
help from the visiting American doctors.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Michel's wounds were already 5 months old. He was
severely burned over 25 percent of his body in January of that year
when a kerosene lamp fell from a shelf onto him while he slept on
the dirt floor of the shack he shares with his mother and six
siblings.
</P>
<P>
   He was seared by the petroleum-fed fire. The fingers on his
right hand were gone, leaving him with what doctors described as a
``mitten hand.'' He was unable to lift his arms. He could not turn
his head from side to side. His feet were swollen. He could not
walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a gruesome sight,'' said Mark Lowney, who practices at
Charlton Memorial Hospital. ``On the plane ride home, I said to my
dad, `You know, that kid is going to die down there.' We knew he
was never going to make it in Haiti.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a month of the Lowneys' return to the United States, the
Haitian government had issued the necessary travel documents and
Michel's mother had signed the required power-of-attorney papers.
Last month, the child boarded a US-bound jetliner and within hours
was admitted to Shriners, a 30-bed pediatric hospital where medical
treatment is free.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love taking care of kids like this,'' said Dr. Robert L.
Sheridan, the hospital's assistant chief of staff. ``They have a
bad problem and you know you can help them and that's really fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Physicians delayed the first of Michel's operations for a week,
while they gave him nutrients he would need to tolerate the
anesthetic and to help encourage the healing of his surgical
wounds. His first surgery closed open wounds, using grafted skin
from his thigh, and separated his chin from his chest, enabling
more normal mobility.
</P>
<P>
   ``He feels much better with his wounds closed,'' Sheridan said.
``He can breathe a lot easier. He loves everything with protein in
it _ meat, chicken _ probably because he was so protein depleted.
He's doing great. Everybody loves him.''
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to Michel's room last week, nurses, social
workers, and therapists described a little boy who arrived ``scared
to death'' amid medical technology that is centuries apart from the
conditions in his Haitian village.
</P>
<P>
   But barely three weeks after this arrival, Michel is slowly
learning the importance of sharing in the hospital's well-stocked
toy room. He draws laughter by mimicking his caregivers' English.
He enjoys listening to music through headphones. He cleans his
plate without fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like beef a lot _ and rice,'' Michel said through an
interpreter last week. ``I'd like to go home and see my mom, and
then come back here.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeremiah Lowney, who is Michel's legal guardian in the United
States, said the boy will probably require six to nine months of
treatment before he can return home. Doctors want to restore as
much mobility and function as they can to him before he is
released.
</P>
<P>
   The Lowneys hopes to raise $10,000 to pay for a prosthetic hand
for Michel and to help build a small house for his family near the
foundation's clinic in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

Haitian Health Foundation, 100 Sherman St., Norwich, Conn. 06360.)

SHAKESPEARE, VIVIDLY REVISITED 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LENOX, Mass. _ You don't usually think of the Berkshires as the
kind of place one prospects for gold, but a pair of directors who
have been mining in these hills for a while have struck the mother
lode. Tina Packer's crystalline production of Shakespeare's ``The
Merchant of Venice'' and Richard Corley's expressionistic take on
Eugene O'Neill's ``Desire Under the Elms'' are such vivid visions,
or re-visions, of the two works that they not only inspire us about
the power of these two pieces of classic theater; they inspire us
about the power of classic theater to be as relevant to
contemporary times as the eras they were written in.
</P>
<P>
   Coherence is a much more important test of a play and a
production's worth than relevance, and Shakespeare &AMP; Company's
outdoor mainstage productions are the most coherent American
stagings of Shakespeare you're likely to see. Using natural accents
instead of faux British intonations, every line of ``Merchant''
seems as crisp and accessible as an episode of ``Friends.'' In the
idyllic setting of Edith Wharton's mansion, the Mount, the results
are astonishing.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over Shakespeare's attitudes toward Jews as measured
by ``The Merchant'' has raged over the centuries, though the answer
seems clear enough. Shakespeare was less anti-Semitic than fellow
Elizabethans, but anti-Semitic nonetheless. This has led a number
of Jewish people in the Berkshires to beg Packer, the artistic
director of Shakespeare &AMP; Company, not to stage this play.
</P>
<P>
   On its face, that's the kind of wrongheaded political
correctness plaguing the arts in America today. But after seeing
this fine production, the only people who could have any cause for
complaint are Shakespearian purists demanding bardian correctness.
</P>
<P>
   The more interesting debate always has been not whether ``The
Merchant of Venice'' should be staged, but how it should be staged
in light of contemporary sensibilities, most notably in light of
the Holocaust. There have been a number of sympathetic treatments
of Shylock, the villainous money lender whose name has become a
synonym for money grubbing materialism, particularly when attached
to someone Jewish. There can be little doubt that Shakespeare
despised what Shylock stood for spiritually as well _ that he
represented, in Shakespeare's mind, the Old Testament God of
vengeance as opposed to Antonio, who symbolized the New Testament
God of mercy.
</P>
<P>
   And yet! It has often been said that the genius of America's
founding fathers was not to spell things out, to leave room in the
Constitution for later-day interpretation. It can similarly be said
that the genius of Shakespeare was to not spell things out, to draw
characters of such humanity and complexity and to put them into
situations of such ambiguity they could survive interpretations
that would have been thoroughly foreign to a 16th- or 17th-century
sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   It is the ingenuity, if not genius, of Tina Packer, to make a
rich, compelling case for a sympathetic treatment of Shylock while
staying true to the comedic dictates of the author. Shakespeare was
artist enough to give her that leeway and Packer is artist enough
to spin that leeway into gold. True, she has done some adding and
subtracting along the way _ a bit too much in the final scene,
methinks _ but this production makes far more artistic sense than
the traditional rendering at Shakespeare's Globe in London, to cite
one example.
</P>
<P>
   Packer doesn't deserve all the credit. We have waited far too
long to mention the name of perhaps the finest actor in New
England, Jonathan Epstein, whose Shylock leaves Laurence Olivier's
and many another's in the dust. Epstein brings such understanding,
compassion and, most of all, power to the role that Louis Farrakhan
might find himself rooting for Shylock against the Christians. His
``Hath not a Jew'' aria, while surrounded by a mob of spitting,
Venetian lowlifes, is the most extraordinary moment in an always
extraordinary performance.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Packer has made him the hero and the Christian
Venetians the villains. What she has done is present a multilayered
portrait of a multicultural society torn apart by ethnocentrist
hating. She has gone beyond any simplistic notions of personal good
and evil toward a dissection of the psychic and social price paid
from Bosnia to Crown Heights when ethnic division defines personal
identity.
</P>
<P>
   In this regard ``The Merchant of Venice'' seems a companion
piece to ``Romeo and Juliet,'' not because Packer has taken a
scalpel to the piece, but because she has really done very little
to it. There is nothing in Epstein's proud, ferocious portrayal
that isn't in Shakespeare. There is nothing in the
sanctimoniousness of the Christians that isn't in Shakespeare.
Portia remains a heroine, but an imperfect one. In a performance
that rivals Epstein's, Tod Randolph delivers a Portia that is wise,
witty, self-sacrificing, and noble, but also vain, sometimes cruel,
racist, and anti-Semitic.
</P>
<P>
   There are no bad performances and several other fine ones. Dan
McCleary is hilarious as both Old Gobbo and the Prince of Arragon,
Portia's second suitor. Malcolm Ingram brings the same nuanced
detail to Antonio that Epstein and Randolph bring to their
characters. Jason Asprey has always been something of a showoff,
but each year he has more to show off and his Launcelot Gobbo is
very funny.

<P>
   Growing up in blue-collar Raynham, Mass., Kathleen Casavant
decided early on that she wanted to be the first in her immediate
family to go to college. But a turbulent family life, limited
funds, and parents who had no experience with higher education made
that dream impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, a school bus driver, and her father, a factory
painter, always had the same response _ ``forget it,'' recalls the
47-year-old Casavant, smiling ruefully. ``They said whatever money
they had saved would be used to educate my three younger brothers.
As it turned out, none of my brothers wanted to go to college.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the girl once denied a college education is exhibit A for
upward mobility for blue-collar women.
</P>
<P>
   On July 1, Casavant became the highest-ranking union woman in
Massachusetts when she was appointed secretary-treasurer of the
400,000-member AFL-CIO organization. Her rise underscores the
changing face of labor and signals a growing realization among
unions they must reach out to women to rejuvenate the flagging
labor movement.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Kathy Casavant's appointment is a recognition that things
are going to have to change in &UR;  &LR; order to rebuild the labor
movement,'' says James Green, a professor of labor studies and
history at the University of Massachusetts in Boston, where
Casavant just recently earned her bachelor's degree.
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, unions have helped working women. Nationwide,
two of every three new members are women, who earn an average of
$2.50 more an hour than their unorganized peers, according to the
Women's Policy Research Institute. The ranks of women in unions are
swelling because of growth in services industries such as nursing
homes, laundries, and retailing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet women still are rare in the upper echelons of unions. Of the
8,600 people who joined Massachusetts unions last year, for
example, 57.3 percent were female, but there are only nine women
among the 60 officers on the executive board of the state AFL-CIO,
which is a federation of unions in industries ranging from trucking
to teaching to nursing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Casavant, a no-nonsense but softspoken woman, arrived at the
AFL-CIO after a 20-year career in textile unions. Looking more like
a demure, neatly coiffed businesswoman than a rabble rousing union
leader, she's credited with helping to turn the Union of
Needletrade, Industrial and Technical Employees into one of the
feistiest unions in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labor is my family; it's not just a job, it's my life,''
declares Casavant, who graduated in May with a bachelor's in labor
studies.
</P>
<P>
   Her introduction to labor began in Raynham. Her mother drove a
school bus and her father was a unionized painter at a General
Dynamics factory in Quincy, Mass. By age 13, Casavant was working
as a hat check girl at the Roseland Ballroom, a 1950s-style dance
parlor where her mother once waitressed. ``I learned to ballroom
dance there because the older men would always ask me to dance,''
says Casavant.
</P>
<P>
   By her junior year in high school, her family life became
``pretty dysfunctional,'' recalls Casavant. Her father began
drinking heavily. (Ultimately, he ended up at the Pine Street Inn
and died in 1982 &UR;  &LR; in a Taunton hospital.) ``To be the child of an
alcoholic is very difficult. They're constantly giving you excuses
why they can't stop drinking,'' says Casavant.
</P>
<P>
   She escaped her domestic troubles at age 18, moving to Newport,
R.I., and taking a secretarial job at Raytheon Co. in nearby
Portsmouth. In Newport, she met her husband, Arnie, fresh out of
the Navy. (Her husband of 26 years is a public school art teacher,
and the couple live in Taunton with their 16-year-old son,
Brant.) &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   After three years at Raytheon, Casavant went to work as a
secretary at Quaker Fabric Corp. in Fall River, Mass. ``I was
working for an eccentric guy who was paying me an executive
secretary's salary to pick up his kids in his Rolls Royce and do
the laundry. Obviously, I didn't stay there for long.''
</P>
<P>
   But Quaker Fabric eventually led to her calling: union leader. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, at the age of 27, Casavant went to work as a bookkeeper
and clerk at the Amalgamated, Clothing and Textile Workers Union in
southeastern Massachusetts. Casavant watched with interest as young
organizers trooped out to pass leaflet in workplaces and woo
workers and then trooped back to the union hall to recount tales
about their day's _ or night's _ work.
</P>
<P>
   Casavant demanded she be allowed to get involved with outside
organizing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Over the next two decades, she moved up from bookkeeper to
senior official for unions representing textile workers throughout
New England. She made her biggest mark negotiating labor contracts,
often for immigrant workers.

 UNDATED: ... immigrant workers.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Celia Wcislo, president of Service Employees International Union
Local 285, which represents health care workers, recalls the first
time she met Casavant, at an antisweatshop demonstration. ``She was
out there dressed very professionally in a suit,'' says Wcislo,
``and she started talking and literally got the crowd to go berserk
... She is a great agitator. Put her in front of a mike, and she
isn't at all what she appears.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's also respected among the guys ... She's opinionated, but
she does it in a way that's not offensive,'' adds Wcislo.
</P>
<P>
   After ACTWU merged with the International Ladies Garment Workers
Union in July 1995, a new labor group called &UR;  &LR; UNITE was born.
Casavant, already secretary-treasurer at ACTWU in New England,
became secretary-treasurer of UNITE's New &UR;  &LR; England chapter.
</P>
<P>
   With Casavant and UNITE president Ed &UR;  &LR; Clark at the helm of
the &UR;  &LR; local chapter of the New York-based union, the scrappy labor
group has distinguished itself despite negative trends in the US
economy that have battered UNITE's primary industries _ textiles
and apparel.
</P>
<P>
   During Casavant's tenure, UNITE rallied outside stores, such as
the Gap and Guess Jeans, accused of selling clothing made with
overseas sweatshop labor. Casavant participated in protests outside
Massachusetts factories accused of poor working conditions. She
played a key role in UNITE's joining with other unions to campaign
for an increase in the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   UNITE organizers &UR;  &LR; also walked the streets of East Boston,
looking for Latino women who had stitched bedspreads and curtains
at Richmark International Inc. in Everett, Mass. ``Some of the
workers complained of being timed when they went to the bathroom,
and there was a situation where some were taking work home and
getting very little pay,'' recalls Casavant.
</P>
<P>
   Others in UNITE _ which has 20,000 members in New England _
called on academics, priests, and minority activists to demonstrate
outside the plant. Their actions paid off when the owner agreed to
let the union organize the plant. He also reinstated laid-off
workers with back pay.
</P>
<P>
   At Louis' Boston, an exclusive men's shop, Casavant picketed
with tailors who claimed their jobs were jeopardized by outside
contractors. &UR;  &LR; Then, she began negotiating with the shop for a new
contract and the workers' reinstatement. News accounts of the
protests raised the conflict's visibility and led to the
reinstatement of four of the 12 tailors.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But the victory was short-lived _ and bittersweet. Casavant
says the company offered to rehire all the tailors, if they agreed
not to remain with the union. ``They were also told they would get
(a wage) increase,'' she says. ``I sat down with them and we took a
vote and a majority decided they would go back without union
representation. I felt the tailors were not doing the right thing,
but this was what they wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   For Casavant, the Louis' case and Richmark's recent shutdown
after the loss of a major contract &UR;  &LR; were disappointments that
underscore the uphill battle she faces in her new job.
</P>
<P>
   For even as unions pour millions of dollars into organizing
efforts, membership has been dropping for years. The US Department
of Labor Statistics reports that the percentage of unionized
workers nationwide dropped to 14.1 percent from 14.5 in 1996.
Reasons for the decline range from globalization and the movement
of manufacturing jobs offshore to the creation of new work in
nonunion sectors such as financial services and technology.
</P>
<P>
   To beat the odds, specialists say, the union movement must show
that it is an advocate for better living and working conditions for
all, not just its own members.
</P>
<P>
   Casavant believes local unions already have made strides in this
direction. ``The AFL-CIO has been in the forefront of the living
wage campaign, and it was certainly instrumental in getting the
minimum wage increased,'' she says. (In Boston and other cities,
the living wage initiative centers on passing laws requiring city
contractors to pay wages that are usually higher than minimum
wage.)
</P>
<P>
   Casavant's appointment reflects a turning point within the
AFL-CIO. Under Joseph Faherty, the Massachusetts group's previous
president, the federation attracted nine women and one
African-American male to a 60-member executive board that had been
the exclusive domain of white men.
</P>
<P>
   Faherty recruited Casavant from UNITE, which belongs to the
AFL-CIO, for an executive post. Last month, Faherty, 65, retired a
year earlier than planned _ a decision made to help groom Casavant.
The move made it possible for then-secretary-treasurer Robert
Haynes to assume the presidency and for Casavant to be appointed to
Haynes's post and increase her name recognition. She is expected to
run for secretary-treasurer in the federation's October 1999
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby Haynes and I wanted women in labor to know there is room
for them,'' Faherty says. ``We also wanted women outside the labor
movement to know that there is no old boys' network anymore, no
matter what some people might think.''
</P>
<P>
   As the first high-ranking female leader at the Massachusetts
AFL-CIO, Casavant wants to groom rank-and-file women and minorities
for union leadership. She is now working with Women in Leadership
Development, a union women's organization, to identify women with
leadership potential. ``We can't just put people in office _
because they have to be elected,'' says Casavant. ``But we can help
prepare them for leadership and we can get the word out that this
particular person has talent and ability and should be heard and
given a chance.''.

<HEADLINE>
PIPES: GONE IN A PUFF OF SMOKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Yes, yes, it's old hat by now, you've heard all about it.
Cigars are hip (ho hum). They're sexy (so what else is new). There
are magazines and radio shows and even a Marxist dictator dedicated
to cigar smoking (tell us something we don't know already). Yet
buried beneath the ballyhoo is a story that has largely gone
unnoticed: the incredible disappearing pipe smoker.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when pipes dominated cigars the way cigars now
dominate pipes. ``Up through the '80s,'' says Paul MacDonald, owner
of the tobacco shops David P. Ehrlich Co. in Boston and Leavitt &AMP;
Pierce in Harvard Square, Cambridge, Mass., ``any real tobacconist
was a pipe store. A cigar shop would just be a stand, in a railroad
station or a hotel lobby.''
</P>
<P>
   Pipes had the cachet that cigars now do _ and the sales. Twenty
years ago, 80 percent of MacDonald's business was pipes and pipe
tobacco. Today, it's 80 percent cigars. The Pipe Tobacco Council,
an industry group, estimates 52 million pounds of pipe tobacco were
sold in the United States in 1970. Last year, the figure was 7.1
million pounds, a decline of 86 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some 3 million Americans still smoke pipes, but you'd never know
it by looking at the media. It sometimes seems as if every other
celebrity is being photographed puffing on a Macanudo. How often do
you see a celebrity inserting a pipe cleaner into his Kaywoodie?
``I couldn't tell you,'' says Gordon Mott, managing editor of Cigar
Aficionado magazine, ``who the current famous pipe smokers are.''
Indeed, there is no pipe equivalent to Mott's publication, the
decade's most successful magazine start-up. Once considered suave
and worldly, pipe smoking now seems so peculiar that ``Seinfeld''
built an episode around its being taken up by Kramer (the most
peculiar person in North America).
</P>
<P>
   There's a reason movie stars are so eager to be seen chomping on
a cheroot. The perception is that cigars are what tough guys smoke,
so that's what Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone want to
be seen doing. Arnold and Sly, pipe smokers both, reach for their
tobacco pouches away from the camera. ``They do not want to be
covered in magazines as pipe smokers,'' says Ed O'Connor, director
of sales and marketing for Spec Comm International, a Raleigh,
N.C., media firm that publishes Pipes and Tobaccos magazine,
``because they feel it's not manly.''
</P>
<P>
   True, A. A. Milne once wrote that ``a pipe in the mouth makes it
clear that there has been no mistake _ you are undoubtedly a man.''
Yet that remark is doubly suspect: Himself a pipe smoker, the
creator of Winnie-the-Pooh isn't exactly a universally recognized
authority on manhood.
</P>
<P>
   Pipes are about reflection, cigars about aggression. It is peace
pipes that get smoked, not peace cigars. No one has ever
intimidated someone with the taunt, ``Put that in your cigar and
smoke it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cigar smokers tend to be open and direct: the Indian chiefs of
the world,'' says O'Connor. ``Pipe smokers tend to be
self-contained and indirect: the accountants of the world.'' Cigars
are $1,000 suits, stock options, swagger. Pipes are jackets with
elbow patches, tenure, avuncularity.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics bear out this image of pipe smokers. ``More pipe
smokers tend to be in the clerical, sales, and technical fields,
and precision crafts,'' says Norman F. Sharp, who as president of
both the Pipe Tobacco Council and the Cigar Association of America
is in a unique position to comment on the difference between the
two smoking types. ``They tend to be methodical and deliberate
people.''
</P>
<P>
   This divergence between pipes and cigars is reflected beyond
smoking. Cigars are a comedian's best friend _ witness George
Burns, Milton Berle, Bill Cosby, and Groucho Marx. Pipes and
comedy? Dan Akroyd smokes a pipe, that's about it. Cigar is the
name of a champion thoroughbred. Pipes are what plumbers fix. After
dinner, gentlemen repair to the library for brandy and cigars. Once
his guests leave, the host can relax while his dog brings his pipe
and slippers.
</P>
<P>
   Women taking up cigar smoking have been highly publicized.
``I've known only one or two females who were dedicated pipe
smokers,'' says MacDonald. To be sure, there has been the
occasional pipe-smoking female _ Queen Victoria, Mammy Yokum,
Angela Davis _ but they're a pretty drab lot compared to such
female cigar smokers as George Sand, Demi Moore, and Whoopi
Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   Cigars give off a whiff of musk (Bill Clinton and Clarence
Thomas smoke them). Pipes don't (Gerald Ford and Antonin Scalia
smoke them). Cigars are about triumph. Ever seen Red Auerbach light
up a victory pipe or Winston Churchill make the V-for-Victory sign
with a pipe stuck between his fingers? Where there's pipe smoke,
there's not much fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar,'' Freud is supposed to have
said. Well, a pipe is always just a pipe. Even artistically, pipes
are all about self-effacement (Frank Stella smokes cigars, Norman
Rockwell smoked a pipe). The most famous rendering of a pipe is
Rene Magritte's Surrealist painting, ``Ceci n'est pas une pipe,''
which in English means, ``This is not a pipe.'' What you see is not
what you get.
</P>
<P>
   The one place where pipes have it all over cigars is in the
library _ where else? _ a superiority that extends to fiction as
well as fact. The world's best-known pipe smoker is Sherlock
Holmes. Huck Finn likes a pipe, and the toughest guy ever to put
match to bowl is Philip Marlowe. Marlowe's being a pipe man comes
as no surprise: So was his creator, Raymond Chandler. Other authors
who chewed on a mouthpiece include William Faulkner, Evelyn Waugh,
Jean-Paul Sartre, Bertrand Russell, and J. R. R. Tolkien. (Readers
of Tolkien's ``Ring'' trilogy will recall that hobbits _ short,
mild-mannered, furry-footed _ smoke pipes. The tobacco preferences
of orcs and Dark Riders go undescribed, but it would come as a
surprise if such dynamically evil creatures didn't indulge in the
occasional panatella.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe pipe smoking contributes to a somewhat calm and
objective judgment in all human affairs,'' said Albert Einstein, a
pipe smoker. Now that might come as a surprise to Josef Stalin or
Fidel Castro. Then again, Old King Cole didn't go around saying,
``Off with their heads.'' Either way, Einstein (no dummy he) was
onto something. ``A pipe smoker is seen as a much more reserved,
laid-back, intellectual-type person,'' says MacDonald. ``The pipe
person wants to look at it. He wants to hold it. He wants to go up
to a mirror and see how it looks there. He wants to tell you
stories about pipes that he has. He wants to be your friend.
Whereas cigar smokers are really more interested in getting the
product and getting going.''
</P>
<P>
   Pipes are about authority acknowledged _ cigars about power
asserted. The most trusted man in America, Walter Cronkite, smokes
a pipe, and fatherhood used to be portrayed as one giant pipefest.
As much as Ozzie Nelson's cardigan or Hugh Beaumont's bafflement,
the epitome of white-bread patriarchy was Robert Young's
puff-puff-puffing in ``Father Knows Best'' or Fred MacMurray's in
``My Three Sons.''
</P>
<P>
   White-bread patriarchy used to be in _ and so were pipes. As
O'Connor notes, ``There's an image in today's world that has the
pipe being something less than hip. In 1960, successful people wore
crewcuts and looked like engineers and, guess what, smoked a
pipe.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Miller, the liberal literary conscience of the '50s,
smoked a pipe. He was also married to Marilyn Monroe. Nowadays it
may be cigar smokers with a nice-looking babe (or hunk) on each
arm. Back then, it was cigar smokers. Pipes were _ dare one say it?
_ the height of highbrow hubba-hubba, a sign of affluence and Ivy
League chic. It wasn't just professors with a piece of briar in
their pocket but the very avatar of pre-Pill sexuality, Hugh
Hefner. His pipe was as much a part of his satyr-savant image as
his ascot, smoking jacket, and ever-present bottle of Pepsi. The
Playboy Philosophy, which might be described as one big pipe dream,
put Hef well on his way to becoming the world's most famous pipe
smoker, at least until Lech Walesa came along.
</P>
<P>
   In yet one more sign of the times, that too has changed. ``He
certainly was a famous pipe smoker,'' says Bill Farley, director of
communications for Playboy Enterprises. ``But after Mr. Hefner's
stroke in '85, he quit and hasn't touched a pipe since.'' (If it's
any consolation to pipe smokers, he also cut out the Pepsi.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are indications _ however faint, however wispy _
that the pipe might be making a comeback. The consensus is that
cigar smoking has peaked. The speculation is that pipe smoking will
benefit. ``People are leaving cigars,'' says Lawrence Samuel, a
trends analyst at Iconoculture, a Minneapolis-based marketing firm,
``and they're going to go somewhere.'' The assumption is that
smokers who've gotten into the habit of going to tobacconists will
continue to do so _ but once inside they'll head for the pipe rack
rather than the humidor.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald, for one, has seen signs of this happening. ``Some of
these stockbrokers are starting to become conscious of the fact
they've spent an awful lot of money over the last few years. I
guarantee you: If you went to pipe smoking you'd save thousands of
dollars over cigar smoking.'' Even so, no one is predicting that
pipes will ever return to their old dominance or prominence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's because of the nature of the pipe smoker,'' says Ed
O'Connor. ``If we were ever again to become a nation that prided
itself on the literate, numerate acumen of the mass of our public,
then pipes, I think, would flourish. If you think about the
environment of the early '60s, the excitement of the great
technology race between the Rusians and ourselves, the importance
placed on math and the sciences _ the post-Sputnik era _ that whole
intellectual movement paralleled the great surge in the popularity
of pipe smoking. So if someone were to say to me, `Gee, when will
pipes become popular again,' I would say, `Probably at that moment
in time when people become more interested in Shakespeare than
MTV.'''

<P>
   Tom Lazay knows what people think of when he tells them about
his product, the Lamp Commander. When Voice Signal Technologies
Inc. begins marketing it this summer, customers will be able to
turn lamps on with a simple voice command, ``Lights on.''
</P>
<P>
   And no, it's not the Clapper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clapper is sort of goofy,'' company president Lazay says
of the device that picks up the sound of hands clapping to turn
appliances off and on. ``People are embarrassed to use it and it's
marketed as a gimmick item.''
</P>
<P>
   What Voice Signal Technologies has created is an innovation in
voice recognition systems, an inexpensive gadget that incorporates
top-of-the-line technology. The company's technology, VSTalk,
decreases the processor requirements for voice recognition,
allowing Voice Signal to sell the Commander at about $39, says
Daniel L. Roth, Lazay's co-founder and the firm's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make neat little gizmos and gadgets that will enhance
people's lives, for under $50,'' Roth says.
</P>
<P>
   Work in voice recognition technology has mainly focused on
applications such as dictation, which allows computers to translate
workers' spoken words into text document files, and telephony,
including customer service lines and call centers.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say lower-priced consumer products, such as the
Lamp Commander and the family of home appliance accessories Voice
Signal plans to develop using VSTalk, could be an important market
segment in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does appear to be a significant market,'' says analyst
Frederic H. Dickson of Branch, Cabell &AMP; Co. in Richmond. Dickson
estimates the market for such consumer products would have to top
$100 million per year to justify research and development
investments by firms such as the Dutch voice recognition giant
Lernout &AMP; Hauspie Speech Products N.V., which has its US office in
Burlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Lazay and Roth, both 25, aren't afraid of the Goliaths in their
field. They believe their 3-year-old company, with only three
employees, has a head start on the competition, giving them a
possible 12- to 18-month window of opportunity to sell Lamp
Commander and its offspring before L&AMP;H and other major players
bring similarly inexpensive products to market.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they're at $39, we'll be at $19,'' Roth says.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting the price-point challenge is Voice Signal's mission, the
founders say. Lazay and Roth, former classmates at Trinity College
in Hartford, founded Voice Signal in May 1995 just after
graduation. Originally they planned to license speech recognition
technology from established companies and use it in their own
products. But they soon realized none of their potential partners
offered the level of technology they wanted at a price the market
could bear for consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked to all the big players in the industry,'' Lazay
says. ``Nobody could deliver the product we wanted for under $20.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Igor Zlokarnik, the 31-year-old director of
engineering who joined the Cambridge, Mass. company in May 1997,
Lazay and Roth developed VSTalk, which they used to create Lamp
Commander and a pipeline of similar home products scheduled for
release at six-to-eight-month intervals. Lazay declined to detail
these future products.
</P>
<P>
   Financial backing for the private company came from angel
investors, Roth says, with family members and friends kicking in
$100,000 and a Boston hedge fund underwriting an additional
$900,000. Two California companies are considering financing the
firm's advertising, although that deal is not yet final, according
to Roth.
</P>
<P>
   Voice Signal plans to market the Commander, now undergoing
safety testing with Underwriters Laboratories, through a 60-second
television infomercial being developed by a California advertising
firm. The company has also approached high-end catalogs, although
no deals have been made, Lazay says. Although the firm has no plans
to offer the plug-in gadget in retail stores, Roth says, he expects
to sell 500,000 in the Commander's first year on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Commander uses hands-free technology, Lazay and Roth
see their target customers as the elderly and handicapped. Roth
says he hopes the assistive side of the technology will help the
disabled, a goal he and Roth set in college after Lazay's cousin
was injured in a car accident and confined to a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   The Lamp Commander can recognize any voice. It cannot in its
current form, however, be programmed to identify individual speech
patterns. The device responds to only three commands: ``Lights
on,'' ``Lights off,'' and ``Lights dim.'' Paring the recognition
capability down to these simple commands allowed Voice Signal to
cut the processor requirements and lower the product's cost.
</P>
<P>
   To combat the pressure of running a start-up firm with little
financing and no products on the market, Lazay and Roth try to
lighten the business up whenever possible. Both wear shorts and
sandals to work, and all three employees compete in daily matches
over the office Ping-Pong table. Even Zlokarnik, who formerly
worked in voice applications at the Los Alamos National
Laboratories, has become quite a Ping-Pong player since joining the
firm, Roth says.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the playful corporate culture, however, lies a belief in
the voice recognition market, which Gaston Bastiaens, chief
executive at L&AMP;H, estimates could reach several billion dollars by
2001. Consumer applications will make up a significant part of the
market, Bastiaens says.
</P>
<P>
   Voice Signal's competitors have already begun to eye the
consumer corner of the market. At Dragon Systems Inc., a Newton
company known for its dictation software, engineers have several
consumer products in the pipeline, says Joel W. Parke, Dragon's
director of advanced technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine walking up to your microwave and saying, `Heat up this
cup,''' Parke says of possible future applications for speech
recognition in the home. ``I think about how horrible the VCR is
(to program), or even changing the channel on the TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and competitors say the home market could go one of two
ways. Voice Signal's Commander has a chip on each unit, but voice
recognition systems could also potentially be linked and controlled
through a central computer somewhere in the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the trends that will be interesting to watch is whether
these emerge as little independent devices linked to the appliance
or whether the PC becomes the nerve center of the house,'' says
Stuart R. Patterson, chief executive of Boston-based Applied
Language Technologies Inc., which is not focusing on consumer
products.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever the trends may lead, Lazay is optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're improving our stuff every day,'' he says. ``As long as
we're ahead of everyone else, we're OK.''

AMAZON.COM DEAL FOR PLANETALL MADE AT ST. PETER'S GATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Successful high-tech companies are supposed to start in
somebody's garage. But when a team of entrepreneurs began an
Internet business designed to bring people closer together, they
settled on a more congenial site: the rented back office of St.
Peter's Episcopal church in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, PlanetAll Inc. has been touched by an angel.
</P>
<P>
   In a deal announced Tuesday, the company will be acquired by the
leading Internet bookseller, Amazon.com, for $87.9 million in
Amazon stock. Amazon also said Tuesday it would spend $176 million
in stock to buy Junglee Corp., a Sunnyvale, Calif., maker of
software that helps consumers do their shopping on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos rejected suggestions that he's
trying to turn his on-line store into an all-purpose ``portal''
site like Yahoo, which offers e-mail, news, and many other
features. Instead, he said, Amazon is focusing on becoming the
Internet's most important retail site. He hopes to use the
PlanetAll technology to create a community of regular customers.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street approves of the strategy. Amazon stock closed up 1
5/8 at 109 7/8 on the Nasdaq stock exchange amid a sharp decline in
stocks overall.
</P>
<P>
   Privately held PlanetAll is a one of several major Internet
sites devoted to the creation of on-line communities. The idea is
to offer a place where people with similar interests and life
experiences can easily find each other and stay in touch.
</P>
<P>
   But chief executive Jim Savage says that PlanetAll is different
from rivals community-builders like Tripod and GeoCities. ``Tripod
and the Web communities are about people who don't know each other
in the real world but share a common interest,'' said Savage.
``What we focus on is people who know each other in the real
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Bezos called the PlanetAll system ``one of the most innovative
things I've seen on line, period.'' He said that Amazon is eager to
use PlanetAll's system to improve the on-line shopping experience
for Amazon customers.
</P>
<P>
   Presently, 1.5 million people have signed up for the free
PlanetAll service. They're divided into 80,000 affinity groups,
built around common experiences. Many members use the service to
keep tabs on former college classmates or colleagues in previous
jobs. Others join up to discuss hobbies and interests. Savage
noted, ``There's over 85 book clubs on PlanetAll.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon will now have an inside track in efforts to market books,
music recordings, and other products to these and other PlanetAll
members. Already, a link to Amazon has appeared on the PlanetAll
home page.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more to come. For instance, PlanetAll offers a
service that automatically sends e-mail to members to remind them
of a friend's birthday. These messages could soon contain a guide
to possible gifts available through Amazon
</P>
<P>
   .com.
</P>
<P>
   ``We literally have a whiteboard full of ideas that we're
talking about,'' said Savage.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for PlanetAll came to co-founder Warren Adams not long
after he graduated from Colgate University in 1988. He wished there
was some way he could keep in touch with classmates. By the time he
graduated from Harvard Business School in 1995, he knew there was a
way _ the Internet. Adams teamed up with Brian Robertson, a
Massachusetts Institute of Technology computer science graduate, to
create PlanetAll in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   PlanetAll members create a personal profile with as much
personal information as he or she wants to reveal. PlanetAll
pledges that none of the information will be sold to other firms or
used for its own marketing purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The member can then check out the thousands of PlanetAll
affinity groups to find one or more suitable hangouts. Many
fraternities and professional organizations have Planet-All
listings. For instance, a member of the National Society of Black
Engineers can keep up with the activities of other members.
</P>
<P>
   Another powerful feature of the site allows users to store their
daily schedule information and their personal address book on
PlanetAll. A user with a thousand names in his Rolodex can get
access to this information anywhere in the world, as long as he has
access to the Internet. The address book is compatible with many
popular management software packages like Microsoft Outlook and can
also receive data from 3Com's Palm Pilot personal information
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the power of PlanetAll increases as more Internet
users sign up for the service. Savage's dream is a world in which
everyone on line has a PlanetAll membership. ``This works a lot
better if everybody's in it,'' Savage said. ``You have to think
big.''
</P>
<P>
   The Amazon deal means a big payday for a number of individuals
and firms. PlanetAll employees own 17 percent of the company.
Another 25 percent belongs to CMG Information Services Inc. in
Andover, Mass., a firm that holds investments in a number of
leading Internet companies. An additional 10 percent of PlanetAll
is owned by Lycos Inc., the popular Internet search service based
in Waltham, Mass. CMG, in turn, owns 30 percent of Lycos, which
Tuesday agreed to buy Sunnyvale, Calif.-based GuestWorld for stock
worth $3.9 million. GuestWorld offers a ``guestbook'' service that
lets people post their comments about Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Despite PlanetAll's new ownership, Adams, Robertson, and Savage
will stay on to run the company. And don't expect to see PlanetAll
head west to Amazon's headquarters of Seattle. The firm will keep
on paying rent to the Episcopal church. No sense tempting
providence.

NOT GOOD FOR OUR HEALTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How can the managed care health industry remain virtually
unregulated in Massachusetts _ of all places?
</P>
<P>
   This is the state where HMOs got their start. It is the state
where at least 50 percent of all patients rely on managed care,
more than most anywhere else in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the high penetration of managed care in this state, it
has only one patient protection, a law prohibiting health plans
from penalizing providers for discussing all possible treatment
options with patients.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Massachusetts has some of the best HMOs around. Even so,
its citizens have a stake in what is a matter of growing national
concern: the fear that managed care is becoming more about managing
cost and less about providing quality care.
</P>
<P>
   Bills to toughen regulation of health maintenance organizations
unanimously passed in both the Massachusetts House and Senate. But
state lawmakers adjourned last Friday without passing HMO
legislation. Why?
</P>
<P>
   Procedurally, this is what happened:
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Thomas Finneran kept the bill bottled in the House
Ways and Means Committee for 13 months. When it finally popped out
and was voted on by the full House, one week remained in the
legislative session. The Senate took it up and passed a tougher
version. A conference committee was convened to work out a
compromise. There wasn't enough time to do that.
</P>
<P>
   To put it much more simply: It didn't happen because the
politicians didn't want it to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Says Judy Meredith, who lobbied on behalf of the HMO
legislation: ``If the will was there, they could have done it.''
</P>
<P>
   Finneran, says Meredith, concluded that industry arguments
against it were valid and ``we failed to persuade him otherwise.''
At the same time, she says, ``The Senate was unprepared or unready
to spend all of Friday afternoon knocking heads on this.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a disappointing end to an effort that began two years
ago, launched with good will and good intentions about building
consensus between the industry, providers, and patient advocates.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the cochairs of the joint committees on health and
insurance joined forces to take on the issue of HMO reform. They
held extensive hearings to examine the state of managed care in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath, says state Senator Mark Montigny (D-New
Bedford), who was cochairman of the joint health committee, ``all
of us felt we had to do something about reforming an industry that
has gone virtually unchecked...and is oriented toward an obsession
with the bottom line and cost.'' In June 1997, they filed a bill
designed to address the issue in a rational and systemic way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key question is: What happened? Why after two years of
work, did we come up empty-handed?'' asks John McDonough, a former
state representative who was cochairman of the health committee and
is now a professor at the Heller Graduate School at Brandeis.
McDonough points to two ``critical events.''
</P>
<P>
   First, he says, within days of the bill's filing, HMO and
business groups met with Finneran and told him it tilted too
heavily to consumer interests. ``At that point, the bill was put on
the slow track. It was not a consensus bill,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the bill was released with only seven days left in the
session. ``It had to be a conscious decision by the speaker. He
wanted to have maximum control over the process, so it was a take
it or leave it situation,'' comments McDonough.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran couldn't be reached for comment yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   As Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham sees it, ``the Senate
had a stronger appetite for progressive protections of patients
than was reflected in the House.''
</P>
<P>
   But the issue is not going away. It is too powerful and too
easily understood by anyone who has ever been a patient _ and that
is every one of us.
</P>
<P>
   How can a state that has been in the forefront of managed care
not have a set of clear, thoughtful, and fair regulations to
protect the millions of its citizens who rely on HMOs?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is, it can't. It is only a matter time before policy
overtakes politics, before public interest overcomes private.

TOP MANAGERS CAUTIOUS, BUT LARGELY UNFAZED BY DECLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You could smell fear in the stock market Tuesday. Was it panic
or just good sense?
</P>
<P>
   Boston Capital asked four of the city's best-known money
managers to assess Tuesday's 299-point plunge and the market's
immediate future. As usual, we got an earful of different opinions.
Here's what they had to say:
</P>
<P>
   ---G. Kenneth Heebner, Capital Growth &AMP; Management, a manager of
mutual funds that emphasize concentrated growth stock portfolios
and real estate investment trusts:
</P>
<P>
   Heebner thinks the market should be worried about the Asia
crisis, but not this worried. He called Tuesday's market decline a
``selling climax.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think in itself it (the Asian crisis) is a reason for
this kind of aggressive selling,'' said Heebner. ``It reminds me of
last fall, when the Asia problem expanded beyond Thailand.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 7.2 percent in a single
session on Oct. 27 over those worries. The Dow plunged to 7161 that
day, but recovered and stood 1,326 points higher at Tuesday's
close.
</P>
<P>
   Heebner believes Asia will have an impact on some industries,
but other sectors will remain mostly unaffected. Danger spots: the
farm sector, oil and oil services. Stocks that he thinks have taken
unfair lumps include retailers, home builders, and real estate
investment trusts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would call this a Swiss cheese economy, solid in places and
gaps. You have to invest in the hard parts of the cheese.
Admittedly, you have to watch out where (Asia) is going to hurt
earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Heebner's short-term view: a probable rebound in many prices.
``My experience has been that when you see big, broad declines like
this where there is not a fundamental problem, you get a recovery
in prices,'' Heebner said.
</P>
<P>
   ---John Ballen, MFS Investor Services, president and manager of
the MFS Emerging Growth fund:
</P>
<P>
   It's been an admittedly rough ride, but Ballen says this is
about where he had thought the market would be in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Ballen said MFS forecasts at the start of the year had
anticipated about 10 percent growth in stock market prices for
1998, roughly where the S&AMP;P 500 advance stands right now.
</P>
<P>
   He said the market was swayed by panic selling Tuesday but
considered it a healthy reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Ballen doesn't see any reason to change the MFS forecast, but
believes stocks could move ahead later this year if there are
pleasant earnings surprises in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   He considers the Russell 2000 index's smaller stocks to be the
most drastically oversold, but wouldn't be in any hurry to start
buying them now. ``I don't know what the catalyst (for their
recovery) is, so I don't think there's any rush to move in.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballen likes individual stocks that have been hammered hard for
disappointing shareholders, like Promus Hotel Corp., Computer
Associates International, and even Cendant Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The place to lose, he said, is in the small group of blue-chip
stocks that have appreciated the most. ``Clearly the Nifty Fifty
are too expensive,'' he said. ``That would have to be high on your
list of things to avoid.''
</P>
<P>
   ---Fred Kobrick, Kobrick-Cendant Management, a growth stock fund
and hedge fund manager:
</P>
<P>
   Kobrick pronounced Tuesday VF Day, shorthand for ``visible
fear'' in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now people are really scared,'' said Kobrick. ``First they
were worried and now they are scared.''
</P>
<P>
   He considers this a very positive development.
</P>
<P>
   Kobrick thinks the market is in a ``mini'' profits recession
amid a healthy economy, meaning there are fewer strong industry
groups making more money.
</P>
<P>
   He said stocks finally plunged when the market's breadth, the
number of stocks rising in price in relation to those losing value,
deteriorated too much while blue-chip indexes continued to look
rosy.
</P>
<P>
   Kobrick thinks the bear market that investors worry about is
already here. He said stocks that have fallen at least 20 percent
from their peak in the last 12 months make up 75 percent of the
over-the-counter market, half the New York Stock Exchange listed
companies, and 40 percent of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people are waking up to is not that we're in a bear
market, but that we're in about the eighth inning,'' he said. ``The
simple story is that people don't have as much to fear because most
of it has already happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Kobrick likes financial stocks, retail, software, and services.
He is avoiding oil stocks, commodities, machinery, and companies
dependant on the capital spending of their customers.
</P>
<P>
   ---Scott Black, Delphi Management Inc., a small-cap manager that
oversees $1 billion in assets
</P>
<P>
   While the markets were selling off hard, Black was buying. ``Not
tremendous'' buying, he said, but buying just the same. ``We didn't
sell a share,'' said Black, one of Boston's best-known value
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake: Black is no optimist in this market. The
situation today looks much like 1973 to Black, when a few Nifty 50
stocks like Xerox and Polaroid were holding up the market. Today
the names are Microsoft and Coke, but beyond those, Wall Street is
already well into a bear market, he says.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that corporate earnings are barely growing, if at
all, and yet the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 is selling at 25 times this
year's earnings. ``You can't say the correction is overdone because
it is not. Stocks were very expensive and they still are.''
</P>
<P>
   In a disastrous small cap-environment, Black's performance has
held up well. He says his core portfolios were up 7 percent this
year through July, compared with a loss of 4 percent for the
Russell 2000. He's done it by looking for recession-proof companies
with ``sustainable earning power.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday he was buying media companies and regional banks.
Cyclical stocks need not apply. Among the stocks he bought:
Knight-Ridder, News Corp., and Hearst-Argyle Television. He also
bought Colonial National, all regional banks, and Centris Group, an
insurance company.

VILAS, 45, STILL AN ARTIST, ON AND OFF THE COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLESLEY, Mass. _ He always knew the game he loved had rhythm.
That's one reason he now sits courtside, reaches into a black bag
given to him by Bjorn Borg, and pulls out an acoustic instrument.
Most people call the thing a tennis racket. But Guillermo Vilas
reminds you, ``It looks like a guitar.''
</P>
<P>
   He should know. Just over 20 years ago, the lefthanded Vilas
wielded racket-guitars well enough to win 15 tournaments and 50
consecutive matches. He tells you that if it hadn't been for a
glitch here and some distortion there, he could have won 100
straight in 1977 and 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time,'' he says, ``it got to the point where I told
myself: `I just don't want to lose.' It's one more reason not to
lose when you're on a streak like that.''
</P>
<P>
   When he wasn't swinging, he would sit back and listen to the
Rolling Stones (``Especially (Keith) Richards''), Bob Dylan, and
Eric Clapton. He has recently added Nirvana to his list. He thinks
it is natural for tennis players to be consumed by music, and not
just because he taught himself to play the guitar. Really, he can't
understand why more people don't see the connection between the
amplified sounds of concert stages and the unplugged dribbles of
tennis balls darting across courts.
</P>
<P>
   When you look at Vilas, you understand why opponents used to say
that he wore them down; that he was built more like a fullback than
a tennis player; that his muscular calves resembled the barrels of
oversized baseball bats. You can also be sure that when he
completely retires his racket, there will still be music. Which
brings us back to rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tennis is an art,'' he says after a 90-minute practice
Tuesday. ``You use your body to maximize the sport that you have
chosen. And that has meaning. You have to have rhythm. You have to
have connection with your body and the ball and understand things.
And that has to translate to something in life that you might like
to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think tennis players are very creative. But they have to use
that creativity and translate it into something when they finish
playing, something that makes them happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Vilas, 45, was always conscious of the final days of his career.
Even when he was going through his intense practices in the '70s,
he surrounded himself with music and poetry. He had at least one
good reason for doing it: He didn't want to be a cliche when
reporters came looking for him to write those ``Whatever Happened
To ...?'' stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I noticed about players when they finished
playing was that they would go into depression,'' he said. ``If
somebody ever makes an article about a tennis player after they are
finished, a lot of the time the players are broke and have
problems. There are players who are difficult to write about
because they don't do much outside of tennis. And then when they
finish playing tennis, they do nothing. They may turn to businesses
and things that are just time-consuming activities to prove that
they are doing something. But does it make them happy?''
</P>
<P>
   We all have heard tales of tennis prodigies, players who are
considered veterans by the time they are 21. We haven't heard much
about players such as Vilas, who has published three volumes of
poetry and written, played, sang, or arranged compositions for
three compact discs. Some children pick up tennis rackets when they
are 8 years old. When Vilas was 8, he stood in front of his
classmates in an Argentina grade school and read from one of his
essays. The subject of his prose was theology. His conclusion was
that anyone of any religion could go to heaven, as long as they
believed in something. He went on to write that even those who
didn't believe in a deity or the concept of heaven could still go
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was seen as a little radical back then,'' he laughs,
thinking back to the late 1950s and early '60s.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say there was never time for tennis. Obviously
there was for the man who many will tell you was the No. 1 player
of '77 even if the highest rank of his career was second. But
tennis was just one aspect of the way he expressed himself. And as
much as he loves the sport that brought him more than $5 million in
winnings, he has never written about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh no, no,'' he said. ``Clapton has a song called `Tennis.'
And another guitar player has a record called `Tennis.' But I write
about what I feel. When you start bringing a lot of feeling into
tennis, you can't play it. You have to be more of a doer. There's
not a lot of time to think about what you're doing. So I haven't
written about it.''
</P>
<P>
   What he has written is a 16-song compilation that is ``a strange
mixture of the slow songs of Nirvana, some Stones, some blues ...
all the people who have influenced me. You can see pieces, flashes,
of a lot of people in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who meet Vilas are not surprised to learn of his life off
the court. He speaks in a rhythmic lilt, often mixing English and
Spanish as he practices. He likes to pull people aside and tell
jokes that cannot be repeated in forums such as newspapers. He
enjoys talking about Walt Whitman, T.S. Eliot, and Dylan (he quoted
him twice Tuesday). And when a newcomer steps on the court eating
noodles from a see-through container, Vilas screams, ``You're
eating worms, man!''
</P>
<P>
   Vilas says he is happy with the quality of tennis he is playing
now. He struggled early last year and then reeled off several
impressive wins. If he defeats Fleming tonight, he will have a date
with the tournament's top seed, Jimmy Connors.
</P>
<P>
   He'd certainly like to win. Doing that would mean only two
top-four seeds would be in Vilas's path, since Borg cannot play
because of severe blisters. But if Vilas plays poorly, it won't be
disastrous. He learned long ago that there was a thriving life
outside the court.
</P>
<P>
   And if he ever forgets, he can always go to Mar Del Plata and
visit the Museo de Guillermo Vilas. That's right: The Guillermo
Vilas Museum. This guy has his own museum?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to turn my house into a museum once I passed away,''
he explained. ``But I still have some time here and I wanted to
make a museum that was a happy museum; a lot of museums are so sad.
My place has a restaurant, pizza place, my cars'' _ including a
1947 Cadillac hanging from the ceiling _ ``my first bike, my
schoolbooks, my Harley Davidson, all my guitars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids love it. It's an interactive place. You can go in
there push a button and see anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The rhythmic man with the bag full of rackets claps his hands.
Wouldn't you know it? His museum also has a downstairs disco.

RED SOX SIGN TOP PICK EVERETT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Now that the Red Sox have signed top draft pick Adam
Everett, scouting director Wayne Britton has just one wish for the
kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I told him tonight at dinner, `I want you to have your
own identity,''' Britton said last night from his hotel room in
Boston. ``A lot of scouts tried to compare him to Nomar
(Garciaparra), but I want the kid to have his own identity. Be his
own self, don't compare him to anybody, and he'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Terms were not announced, but Everett's bonus eclipsed the $1
million that last year's No. 1 pick, John Curtice, received, making
it the largest ever given by the Red Sox to a drafted player.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's big,'' Britton said. ``A long ways from the days I
started scouting.''
</P>
<P>
   The comparisons to Garciaparra are irresistible, even to
Britton. Everett, 21, is a college shortstop from a Southern school
(South Carolina) who was drafted No. 12 in the first round by the
Red Sox, the same slot in which they took Garciaparra out of
Georgia Tech in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a bright kid, a family-oriented kid,'' said Britton,
ascribing to Everett the same attributes Garciaparra has shown.
``He's a very interesting kid, very level-headed, very mature.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can run, throw, has good range and a line-drive bat. He
knows how to play. In a lot of ways, he reminds me of Nomar, but
again, that's irrelevant. I don't want him to be compared to
Nomar.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Garciaparra, Everett is coming out of school lauded more
for his defense than his offense. Baseball America rated Everett
the best defensive player in college eligible for the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Like Garciaparra, the Sox expect Everett, who is 6 feet 1 inch,
176 pounds, to fill out.
</P>
<P>
   But Everett, an All-American this past spring as a junior,
offers the most logical reason for dispensing with the comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really not fair to Nomar or myself,'' said Everett. ``I
get compared to him, but I don't think we're the same player.
Obviously, Nomar has proven himself. He's a great shortstop in the
big leagues. I haven't even proven myself yet. We're two totally
different players.''
</P>
<P>
   Credit for Everett's signing is being given to area scout Jeff
Zona. Britton said he saw Everett play four times for South
Carolina, where he hit .375 with 13 home runs, 15 stolen bases, and
63 RBIs in 62 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going into the draft, I wasn't looking for another
shortstop,'' Britton said. ``But he was the best guy out there, so
we took him.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett is being assigned to Single A Lowell in the short-season
New York-Penn League. He is scheduled to join the Spinners tonight
for their game in Pittsfield but probably will not play for a few
days because of his extended layoff during negotiations between the
Red Sox and his agent, Jim Bronner.
</P>
<P>
   When Lowell's season ends, Everett will report to Boston's
Instructional League team in Fort Myers, Fla. The plan at this
point, Britton said, is to keep him at shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a true shortstop,'' Britton said. ``He's going to play
short. At least for a while, he's going to play short.''
</P>
<P>
   But with Garciaparra an apparent fixture for years to come,
Everett said he wouldn't be surprised if he were asked to change
positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what's going to happen in baseball,'' he said,
``but I figure that to break into the big leagues, that might be
the way I have to go.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of Kennesaw, Ga., Everett paid his first visit to
Fenway Park Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was tremendous,'' he said. ``You really can't get
a feel for Fenway Park just on TV. The Green Monster was a lot
bigger than I thought it was.''
</P>
<P>
   But while he went on the field, he said, he didn't stand at
short. That in itself showed good instincts: first day here and
Everett already knew better than to get on groundskeeper Joe
Mooney's bad side.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe he just knew that that particular piece of real estate
wasn't available.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Sox have signed 23 of their 47 draft choices. Of players
drafted on the first 10 rounds, Britton said he does not expect to
sign the two who have yet to sign, seventh-round pick Syketo
Anderson and ninth-rounder Mark Teixeira, both infielders. Britton
believes Anderson will enroll in junior college in Florida,
Teixeira at Georgia Tech.

SIMMONS' AUDITION SEEN AS A SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ Coach Pete Carroll used a most apt word to
describe Tony Simmons's first professional game, the word being
``clean.'' Perfect, because Simmons's cuts seemed clean, his routes
seemed clean, and his catches seemed cleanest of all.
</P>
<P>
   The first exhibition game often seems a whir and a blur to many
rookies, but Simmons, the Patriots' second-round choice from
Wisconsin (and, for those who keep track, this year's Bill Parcells
compensation, along with fourth-rounder Damon Denson) promptly
showed he belonged on the field against the 49ers last Sunday. The
rookie made six professional catches, looking very professional,
and even more professionally, he constantly was open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were you that open?'' asked a sportswriter, who _ for naught _
spent much of the first half looking for Terry Glenn and Vincent
Brisby to be open. ``As open as you looked?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I guess,'' replied Simmons, assuming a rookie's usual
off-the-field demeanor of humility. ``They wouldn't have thrown it
to me if I wasn't that open. I must have been open enough for
(Scott Zolak) to see me and connect with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he caught his first pass, he felt more comfortable ``and I
began to get that rhythm, and once you get into that rhythm you
start to feel even more comfortable. After that first catch, then
the second one comes easy, and then the third one.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons ran a full variety of routes, too, the deep fade along
the right sideline that his speed dictates, but also hooks and
sideline routes that were crisp and sharp, and he caught the ball
whether he was going deep or coming back short. Cornerbacks had to
give him that 5-yard cushion to respect his speed and the end
result was that Simmons often was open, very open.
</P>
<P>
   Zolak said Simmons ``is really starting to come around. He's
running good routes and catching the ball well.''
</P>
<P>
   The easy pitch and catch between Zolak and Simmons was most
noticeable, of course, because it was in stark contrast to the poor
performance by the Patriots' first unit, which never got in sync in
its first-half action.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Simmons) was the first guy I'd look to in our progression of
receivers,'' said Zolak, ``and on a lot of plays he was open. We
had a pretty good rhythm going between us.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons, said Zolak, ``reminds me a lot of (Brisby) because of
his size'' _ Simmons is 6 feet 1 inch, 206 pounds, Brisby is 6-3,
193 _ ``but I'd say he's a faster guy. Once he gets his footwork
together, people are going to notice he's out there.''
</P>
<P>
   They already have. And the irony of the strong first impression
Simmons made is that the rookie was said to be struggling in some
media reports out of the first week of camp. Now, Patriot fans are
eager to see him in Sunday's game against the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just went out there, and when the passes came to me, I
caught them,'' said Simmons, ``and then I tried to do whatever I
could after I made the catch.''
</P>
<P>
   When Simmons was drafted, misinformation floated around, as
often happens on draft day. Because he played on a run-oriented
Wisconsin team, he caught only 99 passes in four years (even though
his 23 TD catches broke Al Toon's school record of 19), and some
reports hinted that he might be more of a project than a find, that
his blazing speed (4.35 in the 40, probably the fastest on the
Patriots) caught eyes but he still needed to learn much about
catching footballs in the NFL. And that would take time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm working on completing my route-running,'' conceded
Simmons, ``because I wasn't that good at route-running coming out
of college. Now I'd doing a lot of extra work on that, and I've
been working on it so much that it's starting to get into me now.''
</P>
<P>
   At Wisconsin, Simmons added, ``Because we ran the ball so much,
it wasn't like we had a lot of complicated routes; we had simple
pass routes. It was our running game that was very complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   But it may not take as long as some thought for Simmons to catch
on to the NFL. The first exhibition game ``is something you can
enjoy for 24 hours but then you have to go on to the next game,''
he said. ``But it does give you that extra confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons was asked when the last time was that he caught six
passes in a game. &UR;  &LR; (It was last year in a 26-25 win over
Northwestern.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, I really don't know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ever do it in college?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've kind of forgot everything I did in college, because it's
like I'm starting anew again,'' he said. ``I could say, `Yeah, I
did this in college and that,' but saying that doesn't really do
anything for me now here. That's because it's a whole different
level of competition. So I'm just out out here, giving it my all.''
</P>
<P>
   First impressions do count, of course. And Simmons already has
demonstrated that he is more than those NFL comets _ the speedballs
_ who come but go very quickly from the scene because all they can
do is run.

GROUP EFFORT ELEVATES US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS _ Jimmy Oliver is the professor you didn't want _ unless
you were willing to accept a C-plus as an OK grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we honestly went out and took care of business in the
first half,'' said the shooting guard for the US basketball team.
``But I was not too enthused with the way we played in the second
half. It took us, what, seven minutes to improve on our lead?''
</P>
<P>
   Given that the lead in question over Australia was 23 at the
half _ a margin created by Professor Oliver's own buzzer-beating
3-pointer _ perhaps he is guilty of being a nitpicker to the max.
The idea when you're up by 23 at the half (54-31) is not
necessarily to make it 46 at the end. It's to make sure things
never get cozy. And Tuesday's 96-78 final score in the world
championships was misleading, for the Americans never let it get
closer than 18 until the final three minutes of what had been
20-minute garbage time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I was just influenced by (Purdue coach Gene) Keady,''
said Oliver, whose 18-point evening included 3-for-3 3-point
shooting. ``No matter what happened in a game, he always said you
could have done this or that.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter US coach Rudy Tomjanovich. No nitpicker he.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' he said. ``The guys followed our game plan
very well. We played great defense, and that created some nice
offensive opportunities. And we weren't selfish on offense. We
found the open man and gave him the shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss to Lithuania last Thursday is now completely in that
well-known rearview mirror. With this convincing victory over a
decent Australian team, your CBA-Europe-Fuzzy-Cheeked US team has
secured for itself the No. 1 spot in its group entering the medal
round. It has done what it had to do. It is three games away from
the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this game showed,'' said Australian guard Shane Heal,
``is that America is the No. 1 basketball nation. But everyone
knows that. It's obvious this team doesn't have the talent of a
Dream Team, but it has very good athletes. They have all come from
good programs. They are well coached. And this is the best-shooting
American team I've ever seen. Usually, what they want to do is
power inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Did he say ``best-shooting American team''? Since Seoul, no one
has accused America of that distinction.
</P>
<P>
   But what else would anyone expect the Australians to say after
this display? The US squad shot 61 percent (41 for 67), and that
included an eye-opening 8 for 12 on threes. This is highly
un-American behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The US put this game away with an eight-minute, 22-5 run that
left it safely ahead at 37-17. At this point, the competition was
over for the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Included in this burst were two 3-pointers by 34-year-old
European savant Wendell Alexis and one by 24-year-old Kiwane
Garris, who is growing up as an international player before our
eyes. ``I needed to make some adjustments to the international
game,'' he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   A few short games ago, starting point guard Michael Hawkins was
being anointed as the team's lone irreplaceable commodity. But
Garris has come alive in the past two games, earning Rudy T's
trust, especially with his individual offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed to free-lance some,'' Garris explained. ``I was
thinking too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Garris was a college star at Illinois (three-time first-team
All-Big Ten) and is a classic near miss as a pro. He spent last
year as a member of the CBA Grand Rapids Hoops. He got a call-up to
Denver, for whom he played 28 games before being waived March 31.
And, true to form on this team, he can claim on his resume that
once upon a time, he was a last man cut, in this case from the
Clippers prior to the '97-98 season.
</P>
<P>
   He was home in Chicago when the call came to try out for the
world championships team. Like many kids of his generation, he had
grown up with at least the faint fantasy of perhaps one day being
good enough to be an Olympian, or a member of some national team.
The Dream Team reality KO'd that dream.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's in Athens, wearing that USA jersey and earning more
stripes with every passing day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could win that medal,'' he said, ``it would be a great
thing. Growing up on the west side of Chicago, I come from a place
where people rarely succeed. This would be a great thing for me, my
family, the community I grew up in, and just the USA.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a big win that should inform the Yugoslavians and
Russians and anyone else that Rudy's Rejects can play a little. But
if any team was sent over from Central Casting to be cannon fodder
for the Americans, it was Australia, a ponderous squad loaded with
good basketball players who aren't what Americans would necessarily
consider good athletes. The Americans spotted their opponents many
pounds and inches up front, but they were just generally quicker
afoot and more mobile in general.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's noted scorer, the much-decorated Andrew Gaze, was
held without a field goal for the first 25-plus minutes by the
aggressive guarding of Oliver and onetime Fab Fiver Jimmy King. It
wasn't quite the bloody thrashing administered by the NBA stars in
Toronto four years ago (130-74), but it was convincing enough.
There are more athletic teams remaining in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   One pretty much unarguable premise here is that no team has more
legitimate depth than the US squad. Rudy T has the luxury of great
flexibility. He can push and probe until he finds a workable unit
for the purpose at hand. He can put out offensive players. He can
put out defensive players. He can go very small. He can change the
game tempo with two small guards, as he did for a while against
Spain. And he has also discovered a brute force to shake things up
inside in the person of young Brad Miller.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-11-inch Miller right now is one of those players for
whom good things just seem to happen naturally. On his first touch
of the evening, he spun into the lane, sustained a bump, threw up a
wild shot off the glass _ and watched it bank home. A very short
time later, he ignited the best American Moment of the tournament.
As Gaze thought he was sailing in for a sneakaway dunk, Miller came
from out of Johnny Most's famed land of nowhere to block the shot,
igniting a fast break culminated by Garris's smooth scoop shot at
the other end.
</P>
<P>
   It was a night for the Americans to savor, and because of their
good work, Tomjanovich has given them a full day off to sample the
local pleasures. But the serious business will begin Friday.
</P>
<P>

we've accomplished will basically be thrown out of the window.''

   BOEING-MERGER (Seattle) One year ago, a beaming and confident
Boeing Chairman Phil Condit stepped out of a vintage DC-7 on
display at the Smithsonian's Air &AMP; Space Museum in Washington,
D.C., and, with new President Harry Stonecipher at his side, told
cheering employees about an unstoppable ``new'' Boeing Co. There
were no such celebrations yesterday across the great expanse of The
Boeing Co. to mark the first anniversary of the historic merger.
Top executives declined interview requests. It was not a good year
for Boeing. But even though the promise and expectations of the
merger have been largely overshadowed by Boeing's commercial
aircraft production problems back home in Seattle, industry
analysts say the merger will eventually pay huge reward as Boeing's
defense and space units pull even or ahead of what has been
Boeing's core _ its commercial airplane group.

RURAL AMERICA AWAITS LINK TO INFORMATION AGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WARREN WILSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   How soon America's vast rural expanses will join the Information
Age is the key issue in a national policy debate that formally
begins this week but already is prompting sharp dispute in the
telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, just ahead of a legal deadline, the Federal
Communications Commission will offer proposals aimed at making sure
that everyone in the country has access to the advanced data
networks, which are increasingly important in business, education
and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Such networks make good business sense in urban areas, where the
lure of profits is greatest. There, many companies already are
offering customers fast Internet access, sophisticated services and
lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   In rural America, however, where sparse settlement makes it
tougher for businesses to profit, it isn't clear when the
telecommunications revolution will arrive.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are partly economic. For example, if data networks
are confined to cities, rural areas find themselves largely cut off
from the electronic-commerce boom already beginning to occur.
</P>
<P>
   But the consequences could go far beyond business. As the
Internet becomes more important in education, rural students risk
falling behind.
</P>
<P>
   As the health care system relies more on data networks to link
far-flung experts, rural doctors risk being unable to get the same
kind of information as quickly as those in cities. The issue is
coming to a head because the FCC, under the Telecommunications
Reform Act of 1996, must conduct a six-month study to find out
whether advanced telecommunications networks are reaching ``all
Americans in a reasonable and timely fashion,'' and if not, to take
``immediate action'' to make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   Participants and regulators all agree that the stakes are high.
But they disagree sharply over the best way to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   The regional Bell telephone companies, including US West, which
provide the vast majority of local service, say they're willing to
build expensive data networks to serve rural areas. But they want
permission from the FCC to carry data across boundaries where now
they must hand it off to a long-distance company.
</P>
<P>
   And they also want their data networks exempted from rules
saying they must lease network facilities to competitors at a
discount.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors claim they want to serve rural areas, but their
current plans bypass huge chunks of rural territory, US West says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who stand to suffer the most, unfortunately, are
rural Americans,'' US West Vice President Mark Roellig said when a
U.S. Commerce Department agency opposed the Bell companies'
requests.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors such as MCI, WinStar, NextLink and Covad
Communications shoot back by saying their network plans have been
thwarted by the Bell companies' great reluctance to give up their
long-held monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   MCI has been among the most vocal. The Bell companies are trying
to ``hoodwink'' regulators by promising data networks in exchange
for a ``list of goodies,'' Jim Lewis, MCI's senior vice president
for public policy, said last week. If the FCC gives the Bells what
they're seeking, Lewis said, it will effectively end market-opening
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Besides denying their petitions, he said, regulators should
force the Bells to quit stalling and open up their local networks
to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   U S West counters that it is seeking exemptions only for data
networks, not for those that carry voice traffic. The competitors
argue that the reform law draws no distinction between voice and
data.
</P>
<P>
   ``The act stands for the proposition that networks are networks,
regardless of the services provided over them,'' Steven Chrust,
vice chairman of wireless provider WinStar, told the FCC at a
hearing last month.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is fast erasing the distinction between voice and
data.
</P>
<P>
   Voice traffic typically travels on circuits that are dedicated
or reserved for the duration of the call, even if neither party is
speaking.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, however, it is being broken into tiny digital
``packets'' that travel on circuits shared by many users, just as
business reports, stock figures and e-mail are sent. Packets are a
much more efficient use of network capacity.
</P>
<P>
   As the Bell companies develop packet networks, they ``will not
abandon their circuit-switched networks,'' Chrust told the
commission. ``They will merge their existing networks with the data
networks.''
</P>
<P>
   Granting their petitions, he warned, will subvert the benefits
that occur when all services will be deliverable on the same
network.
</P>
<P>
   FCC commissioners have indicated they oppose the two main parts
of the Bell companies' petitions. Chairman William Kennard has gone
a step further, telling utility regulators last week in Seattle
that he can envision local telephone companies setting up
subsidiaries to build data networks that would be ``free of much of
the regulation that is still necessary in the case of the parent
company.''
</P>
<P>
   In theory, such subsidiaries would compete for data-network
business on the same footing as companies such as MCI, giving the
FCC a way to monitor whether the Bells were treating all players
equally.
</P>
<P>
   ``On paper . . . that sounds terrific. But in reality, it just
doesn't work that way,'' Steve Hooper of NextLink Communications
warned the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the playing field were level, Kennard's proposal might
not adequately address the basic problem that rural areas are more
expensive to serve than cities. ``Competition will not serve all
areas equally,'' a government telecommunications analyst said.
``What is going to be needed, probably, are subsidy programs of
some fashion. And that, of course, is the dirty little secret that
no one wants to talk about.''

PAPA BEAR'S NEW BOOK SEES A COMING TIME OF DEFLATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States has not had falling prices since the 1930s.
But last year inflation was at 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Could the price level actually fall, and continue falling for
several years? Most economists don't think so. One who does is Gary
Shilling, author of ``Deflation,'' a new book by Lakeview Press.
</P>
<P>
   Shilling, 61, has been sorting the tea leaves since the 1960s.
As a young economist for Merrill Lynch, he made a name for himself
by predicting the 1969 recession. It also got him fired. He held
court at White, Weld &AMP; Co. until his bearishness caught up with
him. In 1978 he decided that the only job security was working for
himself, and he founded A. Gary Shilling &AMP; Co. Based in
Springfield, N.J., he continues to forecast for corporate clients
and write a column for Forbes, usually defending the bears' turf.
</P>
<P>
   Bears, it is said, don't make money. Maybe, but they sometimes
are right. In 1983, Shilling and a collaborator, Kiril Sokoloff,
published a book entitled, ``Is Inflation Ending? Are You Ready?''
Back then, no staff economist would have put his name on a book
asking whether inflation was ending. Shilling's forecast was
outlandish _ and close to the mark.
</P>
<P>
   Shilling argues today that prices will begin falling because of
a confluence of powerful forces:
</P>
<P>
   _Peace, and the plunge in military spending since 1989;
</P>
<P>
   _Competition, made tough by the strength of the U.S. dollar and
the ``Asian flu'' abroad, and by deregulation at home;
</P>
<P>
   _Financial conservatism, which includes the balanced federal
budget and a new emphasis on personal savings; and
</P>
<P>
   _Technology. The natural direction of technology prices is down,
Shilling says, ``whether it's computers and the Internet today or
farm equipment 100 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Peace is the least appreciated and most important on the list.
``We've been in a wartime stance in terms of inflation-deflation
since the late 1930s,'' he says. ``But if you go back before that,
deflation is the norm in peacetime _ and this is the first real
peacetime we've had'' since then.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s, consumer prices fell by about 1 percent per year,
as radios, cars and electric lights became cheaper. The federal
government ran surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   The comparison, however, is not exact. Clinton's surplus is
barely a crumb next to Calvin Coolidge's. And all the talk about
Americans' new interest in saving money has not shown up in the
national income statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they're the wrong statistics. The Federal Reserve says
American household assets have increased by $12.5 trillion since
the end of 1994. Americans haven't needed to save more; they have
been making too much in the stock market. They will start saving,
Shilling argues, when the next bear market begins clawing away
these gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a 15-year bull market,'' he says. ``The vast
majority of investors, and an even bigger percentage of brokers,
have never seen a bear market. I think you've got a major
correction coming.'' (So he said last week. Prescient guy.)
</P>
<P>
   Shilling argues that the U.S. economy has not yet felt the full
brunt of the collapse in Asia. ``We haven't yet seen the surge in
imports at lower prices,'' he says. ``It takes time for them to
re-orient production and get their financing in order.'' But they
will, he says, and prices will fall.
</P>
<P>
   OK, some prices. But most prices? Can deflation exist in a world
of paper money?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Shilling says. Look at Japan. Wholesale prices have been
falling for six years. Look at Switzerland: four years. The same
can happen here.
</P>
<P>
   Deflation, even a small amount, can change behavior. When most
products are falling in price, consumers have an incentive to save.
Prices of heavily leveraged assets like real estate fall. Interest
rates fall, and credit standards tighten.
</P>
<P>
   In a world of falling prices, he says, technology companies
``have a huge advantage, because what we're forecasting is nothing
new to them.'' (Shilling's son Geoff, 33, is a product manager at
Microsoft.)
</P>
<P>
   Shilling does not expect a deep deflation. In the next economic
upcycle he expects a ``good deflation,'' something like the 1920s
or the years 1876-1896, in which prices fell an average of 1.7
percent per year.
</P>
<P>
   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is still focusing on inflation. In
testimony to Congress July 21, Greenspan used the words
``inflation'' and ``inflationary'' 38 times, ``deflation'' not
once, and concluded that the risks of inflation ``remain
significant.''
</P>
<P>
   He may be right. If I had to bet, I'd still put my nickels on
Greenspan. It' hard to bet against the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Shilling chuckles. Greenspan ``is fighting the last war.''
</P>
<P>
   With inflation ticking along at only 1.7 percent, Greenspan is
still right. We are still in an era of inflation. But just barely.

BOEING'S ROUGH YEAR: LOSS AND PROMISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One year ago, a beaming and confident Boeing Chairman Phil
Condit stepped out of a vintage DC-7 on display at the
Smithsonian's Air &AMP; Space Museum in Washington, D.C., and with new
President Harry Stonecipher at his side told cheering employees
about an unstoppable ``new'' Boeing Co.
</P>
<P>
   The flashy media event to celebrate the $16 billion merger of
Boeing and McDonnell Douglas was broadcast live by satellite to
many of the combined companies' 230,000 employees in 27 states.
Afterwards, Condit and Stonecipher, the former CEO of McDonnell
Douglas, set off on a tour of Boeing facilities where they pressed
the flesh and painted a future as bright as the television lights
that followed them.
</P>
<P>
   There were no celebrations across the great expanse of Boeing to
mark the anniversary. The two top executives declined interview
requests. ``We are not making a big deal of the one-year
anniversary, either inside or outside of the company,'' said Boeing
spokesman Larry McCracken. ``We are concentrating on continuing to
make the company run smoothly, strengthening programs, attacking
costs and increasing efficiencies _ none of which are keyed to a
12-month schedule or artificial one-year-later milestone.''
</P>
<P>
   It has not been a good year for Boeing since the merger. On Day
One a year ago, Boeing's stock was flying high at $58 7/16 a share
after a recent split. Tuesday, it closed at $36~. The company
posted its first operating loss in a half century last year. And
even though the commercial production difficulties are improving,
they are not over.
</P>
<P>
   But even though the promise and expectations of the merger have
been largely overshadowed by Boeing's commercial aircraft
production problems back home in Seattle, industry analysts say the
merger will eventually pay huge rewards as Boeing's defense and
space units pull even or ahead of what has been Boeing's core _
designing, building and selling commercial airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This merger truly makes Boeing the premier aerospace and
defense company in the world,'' said Peter Jacobs, aerospace
analyst with Ragen MacKenzie Inc. in Seattle. ``These production
problems that have occurred over the last 12 months certainly
impact the company in the short term. But once past, the true
strength of Boeing's business will become readily apparent.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, although the commercial side has dominated the
headlines, this was really a merger about defense and space.
</P>
<P>
   What the merger principally gave Boeing was diversification,
meaning the company is less likely to be hurt by the mercurial
nature of the commercial airplane business. That diversification
comes from defense and space side of the company, which Boeing
executives want to eventually contribute 50 percent of total annual
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Currently commercial is top dog with about 60 percent. But
defense and space is gaining. In 1993, Boeing's defense and space
units accounted for only 18 percent of the company's annual sales.
Of Boeing's total sales of $25.5 billion in 1993, defense and space
was responsible for only $4.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, defense and space accounted for $18.1 billion of
Boeing's total sales of $45 billion, about 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By 2002, Boeing expects its defense and space work to contribute
about $25 billion in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Heymann, an analyst with Prudential Securities, said he is
convinced that Boeing's military and space business will eventually
exceed the company's own expectations and account for about 60
percent of total company sales.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that future growth will come from the commercial space
business, which is booming. Boeing is well positioned in this
market with the Delta rocket program it inherited from McDonnell
Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   It also is the principal partner in a project known as Sea
Launch, which later this year will begin launching satellites for
commercial customers from a converted oil rig in the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commercial space has the highest, long-term substantial growth
of any business that Boeing is involved in,'' Heymann said. ``There
is the potential for upwards of 20 percent growth annually.''
</P>
<P>
   The Delta II has for many years been a mainstay of the
commercial and military satellite business. And the Delta family is
growing. Boeing is preparing to launch later this month at Cape
Canaveral its first Delta III, which is more powerful and can carry
heavier payloads. And on the drawing boards is Delta IV, which is
supposed to reduce today's launch costs by more than 25 percent
when it is becomes operational in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we have yet to really see the benefits, Boeing has
certainly become a major power in space as a result of the addition
of McDonnell Douglas and Rockwell,'' said defense analyst Paul
Nisbet, aerospace analyst with JSA Research.
</P>
<P>
   To improve operating efficiencies, Boeing has been streamlining
its space and defense operations throughout the company, and
shifting more work to outside contractors. It is also consolidating
facilities by more than 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Profit margins for defense and space are about 7.6 percent,
according to Boeing's most recent second-quarter earnings report.
They are expected to remain below 8 percent this year and below 9
percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   That's much better than the 2 percent to 4 percent margins
Boeing expects to make on its commercial business next year. But it
is substantially less than the double-digit profit margins enjoyed
by the defense and space business of McDonnell Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has said it will eventually earn profit margins of 13
percent from its defense and space units, but analysts say that is
unlikely because there was little overlapping of programs as a
result of the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boeing was just adding new programs,'' said Nisbet. ``There's
not a lot of room for savings when you do that. The savings will be
more on the commercial side.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing moved quickly this past year to cut away the unprofitable
commercial aircraft operations of McDonnell Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   After examining the books of its formal rival, Boeing decided to
phase out over the next year or so production of three McDonnell
Douglas commercial jets _ the MD-80 and MD-90 twinjets and the
MD-11 widebody trijet. The three planes are manufactured in Long
Beach, Calif., along with the MD-95. Boeing will continue
production of the 100-seat MD-95, which was renamed the 717. The
first flight is scheduled for early September.
</P>
<P>
   Although Boeing has stated publicly it believes there is a
substantial market for the 717, the only significant firm order _
for 50 planes with options for 50 more _ was from launch customer
ValuJet back in 1995. Analysts say if Boeing does not land new
orders soon for the 717, that plane may meet the same fate as the
other McDonnell Douglas jets.
</P>
<P>
   Halting production of the three MD aircraft lines in Long Beach
cost Boeing more than $1.4 billion in pre-tax writeoffs that
contributed to the company's dismal post-merger financial
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing knew going into the merger, however, it might have to
make those kinds of tough financial decisions. Boeing wanted
McDonnell Douglas anyway because it makes advanced fighters such as
the F-18 Super Hornet and the Delta rockets that carry commercial
and military satellites into space.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts say there was a down side to the acquisition
of McDonnell Douglas: The merger may have indirectly contributed to
Boeing's production problems getting so far out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   Once the merger was announced in late 1996, it took more than
seven months to get it approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``One wonders if bringing that merger together diverted some of
top management's attention from the commercial operations, which
continued to worsen during 1997,'' said Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst, who asked not to be quoted by name, put it more
bluntly.
</P>
<P>
   He said Condit was not able to focus his attention on what
needed to be done on the commercial side because he was working
with Stonecipher to get the merger approved.
</P>
<P>
   Condit's management style is to walk the factory floor, talking
with workers, this analyst noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``One can't blame the production problems on the merger, but one
could also say that Phil's management style of being close to the
workers and spending a great deal of time on the factory floor
would have allowed him to notice the problems earlier and take
action.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This would not have been as bad as it got had Phil's attention
not been diverted to closing the McDonnell Douglas merger,'' the
analyst said.

for Fred. It's awesome. That's when you realize how fortunate you
are,'' LaCava said. ``Not only is he a great player, but he's a
great person. You look over at other fairways and see some guys
with 10 or 15 people watching them, but with Fred, he's got 10,000
or 15,000 following him around.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not the travel, the adulation or the money that has kept
LaCava alongside Couples since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that still gets me today is the competitiveness and
being in the hunt,'' LaCava said. ``Believe me, I'm the first to
realize that I'm not out there hitting any golf shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you feel like you are in the heat of the battle and that
you are part of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   LaCava, a lifelong Connecticut resident, got started as a caddie
after learning the game of golf in high school. He would spend his
summers carrying the bag of his cousin, Ken Green, who has been on
the PGA Tour since 1982 with moderate success.
</P>
<P>
   LaCava became Green's full-time caddie in 1987 after Green's
sister decided she no longer wanted the job. He worked full-time
for Green until 1989, and then was replaced by Green's brother, who
was going through economic hardship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had three fun years working for Ken and did all right with
him because he was actually playing pretty well at the time,''
LaCava said. ``So I kind of had the fever and wanted to keep
caddying. And the first name that came to mind was Fred
(Couples).''
</P>
<P>
   He talked to Couples in the fall of 1989 and put his name in the
hat as a possible caddie candidate. Couples agreed to try him out
during the four-tournament West Coast swing in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Couples won the 1990 Los Angeles Open with LaCava at his side,
and the two have been a team since. ``Eight and a half years later,
I haven't looked back,'' LaCava said.
</P>
<P>
   Their relationship goes far deeper than handing out clubs and
walking off yardage to the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like Fred relies on me for a lot of information. So
when he does well or does poorly, you still feel like you are part
of it,'' LaCava said. ``Just being in the hunt on Sundays and
having a shot to win is still the biggest thrill of all.''
</P>
<P>
   The money isn't bad, either. Couples takes in well over $1
million a year in winnings. LaCava is hesitant to say exactly what
he makes, but golf sources indicate it's well up in the six-figure
range. ``I won't go into specifics,'' LaCava said, ``but I will say
that Fred takes very good care of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Most caddies receive about 5-6 percent of a player's winnings,
but that can go up to as high as 10 percent when a player wins an
event. Usually, caddies get a standard wage of about $500 for
Thursdays and Fridays, then a percentage of winnings once a player
makes the cut.
</P>
<P>
   LaCava knows his rise to caddie fame and fortune isn't unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did basically what everyone does. I caddied on the weekends
at tournaments to earn a few extra bucks. That's where you learn
the basics, how to tend the pin, how to stay out of everyone's
line, when to say something and when to shut up,'' he said.
``Obviously, it's a different ballgame out on the Tour, but the
basics are still the same.''
</P>
<P>
   What sets him apart is his ability to keep Couples grounded and
in control of his emotions during a round, as well as his keen
knowledge of how to read greens.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get on the Tour, it's knowing the yardage and the
golf course, and then being somewhat of a psychologist out there,
when to say something and when not to say something. That's a big
part of our deal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   LaCava, 34, treasures the life he leads as a caddie, but he
would like to spend more time at home with his wife, Megan, and
1-year-old daughter, Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Megan is very good about it when I'm out on the Tour. She
knows that No. 1, I enjoy what I'm doing very much, and No. 2, that
I make a pretty good living at it,'' he said. ``You take the good
with the bad. The good is that when I'm home, I'm home and I'm off
spending the whole day with my girl.
</P>
<P>
   `` ... I doubt if I will do this the rest of my life, but I'll
keep doing it as long as Fred stays healthy and wants me.''
</P>
<P>
   LaCava is looking forward to coming to Seattle next week to play
the PGA Championship in Couples' hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's obviously looking forward to it and knows he will have a
lot of people pulling for him,'' LaCava said of Couples. ``Every
week there are always a lot of people pulling for him, but in
Seattle, I think 99 percent of the people will be rooting for him.
I can't tell you how good it feels when you are walking down the
fairway and nine out of 10 people in the crowd are yelling for
Fred. I know it's something he feeds off of and truly
appreciates.''
</P>
<P>
   LaCava laughs when asked what advice he might have for kids who
want to learn to caddie on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great that the kids continue to caddie and try to
earn a few extra bucks. But for every (caddie) who's making a
decent living, there are a lot of guys out there who live week to
week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Couples, LaCava will never be one of those.

SECRET SAUCE 
</HEADLINE>
  By MATT MILLER  
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Evening. The Oval Office. President Clinton works on papers at
his desk. A door opens, and Monica Lewinsky enters, carrying a
large bag. She is wearing a blue cocktail dress. Clinton doesn't
look up. Monica waits a moment, then speaks.
</P>
<P>
   ML: Hi, Mr. President.
</P>
<P>
   BC: Oh, hi, Monica. Don't you look nice! Why don't we go in
here? (He motions to adjacent study.) It's more private. (He
smiles.)
</P>
<P>
   ML: Sure.
</P>
<P>
   (They walk into the study.)
</P>
<P>
   BC: Did anyone see you come in?
</P>
<P>
   ML: No.
</P>
<P>
   BC: Do you think anyone knows what we're up to?
</P>
<P>
   ML: No. To be honest, I think the Secret Service guys think
we're having an affair. (She giggles.)
</P>
<P>
   BC: That's OK. That's better than if they suspected the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ML: Don't you think people are going to wonder why I'm here so
much?
</P>
<P>
   BC: If I thought my science advisers would take me seriously,
I'd go to them directly with this. But I need some kind of proof _
or, I'm telling you, they'll laugh their heads off.
</P>
<P>
   ML: (Indicating bag) I brought the hamburgers and the golf
balls.
</P>
<P>
   BC: Good. Did you remember to make them ...
</P>
<P>
   ML: ... Big Macs with cheese. And Titleists.
</P>
<P>
   BC: That's my intern! (He starts to line the balls up on the
floor.)
</P>
<P>
   ML: How'd you get the idea again? I want to get it right for our
records. (Pulls out notebook and pen.) This could be historical
someday!
</P>
<P>
   BC: It's like I said. I was golfing with Vernon, and when I was
teed up on the 10th I was finishing this Big Mac and some of the
sauce fell off and went plop right on my Titleist. I thought,
``What the hell,'' and just hit it, and I swear to God it went 50
yards farther than any drive I'd ever hit. So I thought, ``Maybe
there's something to this.''
</P>
<P>
   ML: Like Flubber, when Robin Williams invented that stuff.
</P>
<P>
   BC: You can't imagine the applications this kind of thing could
have. That's why we've got to be able to replicate it.
</P>
<P>
   ML: What does Mrs. Clinton think?
</P>
<P>
   BC: I told her we can make some money on this after I leave
office, but she thinks I'm useless in that department. It's better
to work on this when she's out of town. She can always smell a Big
Mac on me. (He finishes lining up the balls.)
</P>
<P>
   BC: There! (Clinton reaches for a putter leaning against the
wall and stands above the first ball.) OK. Hand me a Big Mac,
Monica.
</P>
<P>
   ML: Here, Mr. President. (Clinton takes stock of himself, with
putter in one hand and hamburger in the other.)
</P>
<P>
   BC: Quite a sight, eh? (He's suddenly self-conscious.) Hey,
Monica--promise me you won't tell anyone about this.
</P>
<P>
   ML: (She puts her pen down.) If it's important to you, Mr.
President, sure.
</P>
<P>
   BC: It's too embarrassing. Let's keep it just between us. If
anyone ever presses you about all these visits, just tell them we
were having sex. (He laughs.) No one would care _ they all think
I'm fooling around anyway. This they'd run me out of town for!
</P>
<P>
   (A red phone rings. Clinton, both hands full, turns abruptly to
Monica.)
</P>
<P>
   BC: Can you hold this? (Monica nods. He hands her the Big Mac,
grabs the phone.)
</P>
<P>
   BC: Boris? Hi ... Yeah, I'm working on it now ... I'll let you
know ... Yeah ... I promise. (He hangs up. Monica is fussing with
her dress.)
</P>
<P>
   BC: What happened?
</P>
<P>
   ML: It's nothing. (She reaches for the Kleenex box on the end
table.)
</P>
<P>
   BC: (Sees the stain.) I feel terrible. It's my fault. Let me get
it cleaned for you.
</P>
<P>
   ML: That's OK, Mr. President. I'm sure it'll come out. (She
brightens.) Or maybe I'll just save it. As a souvenir of our little
experiment.
</P>
<P>
   BC: Sure, why not? Thomas Edison's intern probably had a few
popped bulbs in the closet herself! Although ...
</P>
<P>
   ML: What, Mr. President?
</P>
<P>
   BC: No, forget it. For a second I thought some people might get
the wrong idea. The longer I'm in this job, the more paranoid I
get. All right, Ms. Lewinsky, back to work!
</P>
<P>
   (Clinton holds Big Mac over ball and swings putter back.)
</P>
<P>
   (Monica stands poised with pen to record results.)
</P>
<P>
   (Curtain.)

TRAVELING THROUGH CYBERSPACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN FLINN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In less time than it will take you to read this
column, I learned that it is precisely 8,667 miles from my home to
downtown Jakarta, Indonesia, that one U.S. dollar currently buys
15,384.61 Indonesian rupiahs and that the weekend weather forecast
for Jakarta calls for a high of 90 degrees and isolated
thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
   I also obtained the address of every automated teller machine
linked to the Cirrus network in Jakarta (there are many; I stopped
counting at 50), and learned that ``good morning'' in Bahasa
Indonesian, the country's most common language, is ``Selamat
pagi.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not currently planning a trip to Jakarta, but if I were, I'd
be well-prepared, thanks to the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   You've no doubt read volumes about using the Internet for
travel, but most of it was probably about sites designed to sell
you something: an airline ticket, a hotel room, a cruise. The Web
sites listed below are different. Although many are linked to
commercial sites, they're free, useful tools that have saved me
hours of research _ or at least provided an entertaining diversion.
</P>
<P>
   I've been using some of these sites for years. Recently I asked
Michael Shapiro, author of the authoritative ``Net Travel: How
Travelers Use the Internet'' (O'Reilly) for some others. He came up
with most of what follows. An appendix in his book lists far more
sites than I have room to include here.
</P>
<P>
   Flight tracking: Let's say you're going to be picking your wife
up at the airport and you want to know if her flight will be
arriving on time. Point your Web browser to
www.thetrip.com/flightstatus/. You can find out any flight's
estimated time of arrival, plus its current position, altitude and
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Currency converter: Need to know the current exchange rate for
everything from Albanian leks to Zambian kwachas? The Universal
Currency Converter can tell you in a flash: www.xe.net/currency.
You can convert any currency on the planet into U.S. dollars and
vice versa, and you can convert any currency into any other
currency. So, the next time you need to know how many Bulgarian
levs you can get for one Malaysian ringgit, the answer (as of this
writing) is 431.90. (There are a number of currency converters on
the Web, including ones lined to the Microsoft Expedia and Travlang
sites. They all seem to work equally well.)
</P>
<P>
   ATMs: The MasterCard/Cirrus ATM Locator (www.mastercard.com/atm)
lists the locations of more than 350,000 automated teller machines
around the world tied to the Cirrus network, including those at
international airports. (Turn over your ATM card to check for the
logos of the ATM networks your account is linked to. You'll find
ATMs just about everywhere these days. Using this site, I even
found two in the Galapagos Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Weather: Want to know the current weather and three-day forecast
for virtually any major city in the world? Check out the Weather
Channel's Web site at www.weather.com.
</P>
<P>
   Language: It always pays to learn a few words and phrases before
visiting a foreign country. A site called Travlang
(www.travlang.com/languages) supplies the basics in more than 60
languages, from French and Italian to Basque, Welsh, and
Azerbaijani. There's also a feature that allows you to translate
virtually any word into any other language. In many of the
languages, if you have the proper browser plug-in _ which, to my
profound surprise, my computer already did _ you can even click on
a foreign phrase and hear it pronounced. Cool!
</P>
<P>
   How far is it? Ever wonder precisely how many miles it is from
your home to Quito, Ecuador, or whether London is closer to Paris
or Edinburgh? Point your browser to www.indo.com/distance. It will
calculate the distance between any two points, plus the precise
latitude and longitude of each.
</P>
<P>
   Directions: Here's one for those afraid to ask a stranger for
directions: www.mapquest.com. You enter any two addresses in the
United States and it will give you turn-by-turn directions and a
thumbnail map. I tried it between my home and office, and the
information was dead-on accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Culture: What's on in theaters, concert halls, museums, etc., at
your destination? CultureFinder
(http://culturefinder.mediapolis.com) can tell you. Just enter the
U.S. city you'll be visiting and the dates you'll be there, and
you'll get a thorough list.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism offices: Tourist offices are often a good source of
information for travelers. To find address, phone numbers, e-mail
addresses and Web listings for both foreign and U.S. state offices,
try www.towd.com. To obtain listings for every foreign embassy in
Washington, D.C., try www.embassy.org.

`HALLOWEEN': A HORROR OF A MOVIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOB STEPHENS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Halloween: H20'' is a horror movie that plays strictly by the
rules.
</P>
<P>
   And the rules are, by now, depressingly familiar: A slasher film
must use a bunch of red herrings, deliberately false leads that are
left as clues; harmless characters are required to startle the
audience by abruptly jumping into the frame to the accompaniment of
a loud chord; filmmakers must cheat a little by making one
character seem to be another in very dark scenes, allowing viewers
the thrill of being unable to tell the guilty from the innocent;
the apparently defeated monster is to be resurrected repeatedly
near the movie's conclusion; an attitude of puritanical sadism must
be expressed in the slaughter of sexually active characters; and a
contemptible misogyny, revealed in the cruel fixation on female
dismemberment, is compulsory.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ``H20'' is a 20th anniversary effort to capitalize
on the commercial success of John Carpenter's first, vastly
overrated ``Halloween'' film and the sequels that followed. (To put
Carpenter's hack work on the level of such original movies as
``Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' and ``Night of the Living Dead,'' as
some reviewers have done, is a pathetic joke.)
</P>
<P>
   With the odd exception of ``Halloween III,'' which deals with
lethal booby traps for millions of children, the series focuses on
Michael Myers' homicidal pursuit of his relatives, their friends
and any stranger who just happens to get in the way. In ``H20,''
Myers' sister, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), the head mistress
of a private school, leads the life of a pill-popping psychological
disaster, a person so overwhelmed with dread she can barely
function, and she always gets worse whenever the October holiday
draws near.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic conflicts are set up by her relationship with an
unruly son (Josh Hartnett), who's skeptical of the reality of
Myers' continuing threat to the family, and her distracting love
affair with a school counselor (Adam Arkin) who foolishly thinks he
can handle any knowledge of her secret past and carefully veiled
present.
</P>
<P>
   The new movie is also filled with cozy, in-group allusions. It
contains a lot of references to earlier ``Halloween'' movies, Ed
Wood's ``Plan 9 From Outer Space'' and Alfred Hitchcock's
``Psycho.'' Regarding the last film, Janet Leigh, who starred in it
and has a cameo role in ``H20,'' prattles away in a cutesy manner,
warning the heedless Laurie about the mundane, rather than
Hitchcockian, dangers of showers. (At least the ridiculous Michael
Myers isn't a killer fungus from beneath the tiles!)
</P>
<P>
   Director Steve Miner, who previously made a movie of amiable,
slightly grotesque charm called ``House,'' has created a
run-of-the-mill horror film this time. But there's an important
catch that will probably save his rear end: Not only has the horror
genre deteriorated over the last 25 years, so has the audience for
these movies. The preview group I saw ``H20'' with was born to
enjoy this film as surely as it was made for them.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the contemporary horror movie has ceased being an
individual work full of surprises and fresh manifestations of the
Gothic imagination _ it has, instead, been reduced to the level of
an inflexible, repetitious, ritualistic event. It has become a
primitive ceremony for people ignorant of the uses of symbolism,
metaphor and allegory, a crowd that only wishes to be catered to
with, among other concessions, a greater literalism of the
cinematic image.
</P>
<P>
   These bloodthirsty viewers need the reassurances, the security,
of predictability. They come to scream at the heroine for her
stupidity, her brainless placing of herself in harm's way. They
cheer the futility of the butchered victim's attempts to escape.
And, in a hypocritical betrayal _ especially after they've wallowed
in the subjective viewpoint of the camera, a perspective that
reinforces a sympathy with the killer _ the audience turns on the
very murderer who gave them such brutal pleasure and laughs at, or
even gloats over, his temporary demise.
</P>
<P>
   Any horror film that cues these moviegoers in the expected way,
that sets up the repetition of responses they are so willing to
give, should be a box office success. But the inevitable confusion
caused by the inept title selection, the unintended but unavoidable
connotations of water in the term ``H20,'' suggest another, more
hopeful, fate for the movie: True lovers of film, who desire much
more than the bogus realism of graphic effects, will probably have
fantasies about taking this piece of junk out and drowning it like
a rat.

<HEADLINE>
SAN FRANCISCO IS GREAT FOR STROLLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Drive around San Francisco, and you'll see that
the combined forces of the Department of Public Works and Pacific
Gas &AMP; Electric have solved the traffic problem. They've stopped it
completely.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth Street toward the bridge _ lanes closed. Fourth Street,
ditto. You can't even get to the traffic jams on the Bay Bridge or
Highway 101 anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Second Street, mostly closed for construction of highrises that
will put even more cars on the street when they're completed. Those
cars won't move, either.
</P>
<P>
   Mission Street in the Outer Mission _ an entire lane shut down
for blocks. It's a vital shopping district, but try getting there
to shop.
</P>
<P>
   Webster and Pacific _ dug up. Fillmore and California _ dug up.
Fillmore and everything _ dug up. Every block around the California
Pacific Medical Center is dug up, requiring a triple bypass to drop
off a patient.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeenth Street near Treat has a hole in the middle of it big
enough to trap a tank. Even curvy little Manchester Street in
Bernal Heights is being PG&AMP;E'ed from end to end.
</P>
<P>
   The Embarcadero near Broadway is being realigned by enough heavy
equipment to strip-mine Montana. An electric sign flashes the
enigmatic message: ``Lanes changed.''
</P>
<P>
   No specifics on which lanes. Just ``changed.'' That says it all
for the entire city.
</P>
<P>
   We know San Francisco's infrastructure needs repair, constant
repair, and we salute the hardworking people in hard hats. But we
have some questions.
</P>
<P>
   What do these workers do all winter? Is this some kind of
seasonal work _ dig up San Francisco streets in the summer, and
Miami streets in the winter?
</P>
<P>
   Can you buy stock in the company that makes orange vests?
</P>
<P>
   A cabdriver complained to me that he never knows where streets
will be shut down on any given day, not counting the major arteries
that are always partially shut down.
</P>
<P>
   ``PG&AMP;E will just show up on Montgomery Street and shut it down
at 1 p.m., never thinking twice about it,'' the cabbie said.
</P>
<P>
   He thought PG&AMP;E and the DPW should be required to publish a list
of streets they're going to shut every day in the newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   I hate to differ with a person who has to make a living by
merging lanes and going nowhere all day, but I believe great
thought goes into the work of the DPW and PG&AMP;E.
</P>
<P>
   There's no way they could bring a great city with a great grid
of streets to a complete standstill without a strategy. And they do
it so many different ways on so many different days.
</P>
<P>
   The way I see PG&AMP;E and the DPW is that they're like the Army and
the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   They compete with each other. They have bottomless funds.
They're badly coordinated. They never seem to finish the job. But
they have the same mission: defeat drivers, buses, trucks,
double-parkers, tourists and eardrums.
</P>
<P>
   As in war, surprise is the key element.
</P>
<P>
   How many times have you evaded the day before's construction,
only to come over a hill and screech to a halt in front of a new
hole in the ground with cones around it? That's the result of
successful dig-and-run tactics.
</P>
<P>
   I've never been in the war room of either PG&AMP;E or the DPW, but I
imagine it looks a lot like war rooms in movies about the Pentagon.
It's filled with huge back-lit maps and Patton-like guys waving
pointers at little suction-cup flags.
</P>
<P>
   The general in charge of PG&AMP;E points to Bernal Heights and
orders three trucks and five guys to stage a diversionary attack at
the edge of Precita Park. For authenticity's sake, the five guys
will lie in a driveway for a very long lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Then the PG&AMP;E commander moves a flag to the key intersection of
Second and Mission for the main attack. No one will be expecting
trench warfare there, because the competition, DPW, shut down the
intersection two weeks before, and private construction crews
already have most of Second Street blocked.
</P>
<P>
   Perfect. The construction is even in a red zone, making buses
stop in the street and dump passengers into piles of gravel and
perhaps even a trench.
</P>
<P>
   Mission accomplished. Mission Street impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The scene at the competing DPW headquarters is very much the
same. The goal for each agency is to take control of as many
intersections as possible, sort of like a Monopoly board, except no
one ever passes Go.
</P>
<P>
   The DPW and PG&AMP;E do great work. Think of what they've
accomplished so far this summer.
</P>
<P>
   They've eliminated red-light running at many intersections. You
can't run a light if there's a hole in the way. Well, there are
some Evel Knievels who try.
</P>
<P>
   They've eliminated double-parking, and created an entirely new
kind of San Francisco parking: Right in the middle of the street,
the only place left to ditch a car.
</P>
<P>
   They've stopped speeding. They've given the advantage to
bicyclists, who are better at slaloming cones. They've given the
Muni bus system an excuse for not arriving.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, the DPW and PG&AMP;E have given San Franciscans a
needed preview of what their city will be like when the Brown phase
of Manhattanization is complete. Nothing will move _ and unlike
Manhattan, mass transit will be a massive joke.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the exercise you'll get in this greatest of walking
cities. Thank you, DPW and PG&AMP;E.

UNSTABLE CONDITION: 
NEW TEACHING HOSPITAL HAS DIVIDED MEDICAL COMMUNITY IN SOUTH TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For weekend release, Aug. 8) 
 
By JAMES PINKERTON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARLINGEN, Texas _ For decades, Rio Grande Valley leaders
hungered for more local educational opportunities for the bright
young students graduating from area high schools.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they watched many of the better students leave to
attend Harvard, Stanford and other prestigious universities, in
many cases never to return.
</P>
<P>
   So business and educational leaders were enthusiastic when the
state Legislature in May 1997 ordered the University of Texas _
despite misgivings by UT administrators _ to build a $30 million
branch in the Valley of an existing UT medical school. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Supporters say the new medical school branch, scheduled to open
next year, will not only greatly improve medical education
opportunities, but also will bring $100 million a year to the
economy of the South Texas city chosen as its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Tupper, executive director of the federally-funded Lower Rio
Grande Valley Area Health Education Center, said the medical school
also could mesh with existing efforts to treat the Valley's
thousands of indigent patients, who have no public hospital to turn
to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the (school) is in a very ideal position to tie some
of these indigent clinics together and provide the third- and
fourth-year students an excellent experience in a clinical
setting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the new teaching hospital _ where nearly 100 medical
students and residents will complete their training in family
practice, general practice, obstetrics and gynecology, internal
medicine and pediatrics _ has divided the Valley's medical
community.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, scores of physicians have enthusiastically embraced
the RAHC _ a Regional Academic Health Center _ and view it as a
catalyst to attract long-awaited research grants and contracts.
They say it is needed in a region with many unique medical
maladies, including drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis and high
rates of diabetes, that are usually studied by researchers from
outside the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been studied to death,'' said Dr. Roberto Robles, a
cardiologist and Brownsville native. ``What I'd like to see is for
the people in our own region to have the facility to do careful
studies of our own medical problems, and come up with our own
solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   But a sizable number of doctors fear the medical school is
doomed to mediocrity, or worse, because of the Valley's historic
scarcity of educational resources and medical specialists needed to
build top-notch residency programs. They note that rotations in the
Valley by doctors in two residency programs were canceled just last
year because of problems with sponsoring doctors and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors in the Valley and elsewhere also fear that the new
teaching hospital eventually will compete with them for their
paying patients, threatening $465 million worth of annual income
they receive for providing Valley residents with federal Medicaid
services.
</P>
<P>
   Some anticipate a South Texas version of the ``town vs. gown''
battle between private doctors and academics that erupted in
Galveston in 1995 when UT's medical branch expanded its coverage
and began competing with local doctors. The same issue is now under
debate in El Paso, where some physicians say Texas Tech's regional
health center is encroaching on their turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``The medical people are kind of iffy about it,'' said Dr.
Michael Forman, a Harlingen anesthesiologist who favors the school
and would like to join its faculty.
</P>
<P>
   ``On paper, they're for it. But people are worried because the
history of these places is they have to generate revenues to keep
going, so they end up taking revenue from doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Guckian, vice chancellor for health affairs at UT,
said that although the university was originally opposed to
building the Valley branch, ``we obviously will do as we are asked
by the Legislature, and since we have been authorized to do it,
we'll do our absolute, dead-level best to provide quality
education.''
</P>
<P>
   And city officials across the Valley, including the three
largest cities vying to host the school _ Brownsville, Harlingen
and McAllen _ are eagerly awaiting the facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will really help a lot, for all our people here,'' said
Brownsville Mayor Henry Gonzalez, a longtime businessman. ``And
also it will be a shot in the arm for the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   While city leaders wait for UT regents to announce a site at
their meeting Aug. 12, a bitter exchange of words, public and
private, has erupted between the two legislative sponsors of the
Valley medical school and skeptical doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-six of the nearly 500 doctors practicing in Hidalgo
County support the medical school. The county medical society
refuses to endorse it.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Juan Hinojosa, D-Edinburg, has blasted medical
opponents of the UT facility as ``foreign-born doctors'' who are
``spreading misinformation'' and ``only care about their
pocketbooks.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Alexander Feigl, president of the Hidalgo-Starr Counties
Medical Society, wrote to Hinojosa recently, saying elected
officials have allied themselves with a system that is ``a predator
of private practices.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are saying this is for the indigents and poor people,
and it's all a bunch of crap,'' he said. ``It's $30 million, but
there's not one dollar earmarked for indigent care.''
</P>
<P>
   Feigl noted that before the Legislature required UT to establish
a medical school, UT officials had stated that the Valley was not
ready for such a facility. Instead, they advised continued
development of residency programs through existing Valley
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Developing five residency programs at the new teaching hospital
will be a difficult task, Feigl and his colleagues believe.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it would be better to have one good residency program
than five struggling to get by or keep their heads above water,
which they will be,'' says Feigl, a McAllen urologist.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Eddie Lucio, D-Brownsville, said there is ample room
for private and university doctors in an impoverished region that
has been declared medically underserved by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the main thing I'm hearing from (the doctors) is they
want to make sure this is a first-class medical school first of
all, and not a fly-by-night,'' said Lucio. ``The second thing they
don't want to see is all kinds of state clinics go up, where the
clinics would take all their patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand their concerns, but I cannot accept any
doctor that feels this would be too competitive because of the mere
fact there is a tremendous shortage of doctors, according to the
citizen-to-doctor ratio,'' Lucio said, citing state health
department figures of one doctor for each 8,933 residents in Starr
County. But the Hidalgo County medical society counters that its
residents aren't underserved. They say the doctor-to-patient ratio
there is 1:1,681.
</P>
<P>
   Lucio noted that Valley residents currently must travel to
Houston, San Antonio and other cities to receive specialized
treatment. He wants those dollars _ and the jobs they could support
_ to stay in South Texas.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lucio's office, in fiscal year 1997 doctors and
hospitals in the four-county Valley area received $334 million in
federal Medicaid payments. But an additional $132 million was paid
to doctors and hospitals outside the region who treated Valley
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important for us to focus on the inability to
provide health care services to a certain sector of our
community,'' Lucio said. ``We are seeing tens of millions of
dollars going out of the Valley to Houston and San Antonio for
child health care for services we can't provide.''
</P>
<P>
   During their Aug. 12-13 meeting, UT regents in Austin are
scheduled to select the site for the medical school headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Brownsville, the Valley's largest city, where 134 doctors signed
a petition supporting the new medical school, has pledged to donate
an 11-acre site next to the city's newest hospital, Valley Regional
Medical Center, and $8.4 million in grants. Harlingen offers an
18-acre tract next to Valley Baptist Medical Center and $3.5
million in cash. McAllen's bid includes a 6.2 acre tract and other
inducements.
</P>
<P>
   Valley residents say the effort to find a home for the medical
school has already produced a side benefit. Instead of the usual
sniping and in-fighting over the location of public projects that
have long characterized Valley politics, cities and counties in the
end teamed up to produce a regional bid _ with three options for
the headquarters site _ and agreed to support whichever city UT
selects.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, that's the most significant part of the whole thing,
that all these cities and counties have gotten together for the
first time in the history of the Valley, that I know of,'' said
Randy Whittington, a Harlingen attorney and member of a newly
created medical school foundation. ``It's competition, but
competition in a cooperative way with rules that everybody has
agreed to.''
</P>
<P>
   For Lucio, the Valley medical school is just the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see the (school) develop into a full-fledged
health sciences center such as the one in San Antonio,'' he said.
``A free-standing medical school with a teaching hospital with a
yearly economic impact of $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what they have in San Antonio. It would provide many,
many jobs in the medical field for many citizens that otherwise
would leave the Valley to secure good, high-paying jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Tupper has estimated there could be as many as 30,000 new jobs
created over the next 10 years if the state expands the branch
school into a full-fledged medical school.
</P>
<P>
   At his private clinic in McAllen, Dr. Feigl wonders why leaders
want to risk harming a vital sector of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The medical community has been built here _ and it's arguably
one of the finest along the U.S.-Mexico border _ at no cost to the
city or the state,'' he said. ``It's been done with private
practitioners setting up their practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic benefit reaped by the city has not cost them
anything. So we're a little bit confused why they want to pay so
much money to get some residency programs. Because that's all it
is.''

AMID WAVES OF WEIRD WEATHER, WARNINGS ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ From coast to coast, a weird weather trend that
started almost a year ago continues, fueled, some fear, by global
warming.
</P>
<P>
   fficials in parched Mexico declared emergency water
conservation rules for Monterrey, the nation's third-largest
metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   Record-high temperatures fried inhabitants of Eastern Europe,
killing up to 20 people in Romania.
</P>
<P>
   In parts of Texas, temperature readings settled into the 80s
Tuesday after 29 days of temperatures of 100 or more. Rain sailed
in on the back of a low-pressure system, which also showered
dry-as-a-bone Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to clouds and rain over north Texas, the summer of 1998
lost its bid for the worst on record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to have a good run for second place, however,''
said Tommy Kircher with the National Weather Service in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   What does it all mean? Is global warming _ long thought to be an
apocalypse for the next century _ already knocking on humanity's
door? Or is this just the flip side of the El Nino winter
phenomenon?
</P>
<P>
   In the past, skeptics have cautioned that climate always
generates extreme transient events. They note that people of every
generation seem convinced that their skies are the unfriendliest.
</P>
<P>
   They illustrate this point with a cartoon from the 1960s, from
Weatherwise magazine, which showed two women in miniskirts
shivering in a blizzard. One woman says, ``It seems like winters
are colder than they used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 19th century, frontier settlers lamented repeated
tornado onslaughts. Some mistakenly blamed twisters on mysterious
atmospheric effects triggered, perhaps, by the construction of
telegraph lines and railroads.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't pin any one event and say, `This is global
warming,''' acknowledges Steve Pedery of the Sierra Club in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Asheville, N.C., had a record low Tuesday _ 49 degrees,
1 degree lower than the record set 13 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Long runs of extremely hot weather aren't new. In 1980 in Fort
Worth, temperatures surpassed 100 degrees for 69 days straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you look at the extreme weather trend over the last
decade _ say, 100-year floods every three to four years, and these
heat waves _ it's a disturbing picture,'' Pedery said. ``It's a
projection of what scientists think will become (more common in the
future).''
</P>
<P>
   The bad weather ``may be a foretaste of what we'll be
experiencing 50 or 75 years down the road,'' Pedery said. ``The
extreme weather of the last year has not been limited to the Texas
heat wave. It includes fires in Florida to flooding in California
last spring and winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the wintertime temps around the country were really
bizarre this year. ... Concord, New Hampshire, reached 89 (degrees)
on March 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' Pedery declared, ``is not normal!''
</P>
<P>
   Abnormal weather was recorded across the country this year with
the arrival of El Nino, which occurs when the eastern Pacific Ocean
near the coast of South America becomes unusually warm. That warm
water generates rising moist air that can disrupt the powerful jet
stream high in the atmosphere, resulting in changes in weather
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Now, scientists say, we may be experiencing the opposite of El
Nino, La Nina. In this weather phenomenon, the pool of ocean water
cools below normal, a change that also affects air patterns but is
less well understood.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a decade ago, scientist James Hansen of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration was criticized for suggesting
that global warming had arrived.
</P>
<P>
   According to climate theorists, as the world industrializes, the
burning of oil and other fossil fuels generates carbon dioxide gas.
The sun-warmed Earth routinely emits invisible infrared radiation;
carbon dioxide, like a blanket, traps the radiation, preventing it
from escaping to outer space. The atmosphere warms.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Pedery's view that no one weather event can be traced to
global warming, the Sierra Club implies as much with an anti-global
warming brochure that it unveiled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The brochure notes that the ``nine warmest years on record have
all occurred in the last 11 years,'' and that the ``first six
months of 1998 were the warmest first half of a year globally since
records began in 1860.''
</P>
<P>
   An accompanying map of the United States shows numerous examples
of local weather events, and asserts: ``The weather is telling us
that global warming has begun.''
</P>
<P>
   This year brought the wettest May on record to Northern
California, the hottest recorded April to Portland, Ore., a
deluge-related outbreak of rattlesnakes, rodents and insects to
Southern California, and similar miseries elsewhere.

<P>
   Women in Latin America know they are alone when it comes to
protecting themselves against sexual crimes. But in few countries
are they as defenseless as in Mexico, where the police who are paid
to protect them often become the source of their terror.
</P>
<P>
   An entire battalion of the Mexican police _ 24 in all _ is being
accused of sexually abusing and raping three teen-age girls. Nine
of them have already been identified by the victims.
</P>
<P>
   The girls _ age 13, 15 and 18 _ were walking down the streets of
Xochimilco, a suburb of southern Mexico City, at 10 o'clock on July
19, a tranquil Sunday night. A police van stopped. The girls got
in. It is unclear whether the policemen stopped to ask the girls
for directions and then forced them in or if the girls needed
directions and got into the vehicle voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, once in the van, the three girls were driven to a
place that can only be described as hell _ a horse stable, property
of the police force. There, for four nights, they were forced to do
as they were told. They were humiliated by the many men in uniform
who dropped by and demanded to be served _ to be waited on and
cooked for. The girls were tortured and sexually molested. The
youngest two were raped.
</P>
<P>
   Today they are free _ and fortunate to be alive _ because the
18-year-old was able to escape and luckily found the rare policeman
who would listen to her and take action rather than join the tragic
escapade.
</P>
<P>
   The story, as pitiful and horrific as it is, is not surprising.
It stands as an indictment of the state of the police force in
Mexico, as well as a reminder of the fear women in Latin America
must live with every day.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers estimate that an average of 82 rapes are committed
in Mexico City daily. Few are reported. Mexican women, like other
women in Latin America, know they are on their own when it comes to
sexual crimes. The justice systems see rape with the same eyes and
the same attitudes that characterize most Latin men: husbands who
believe that demanding sex is a conjugal right or judges who first
will decide if the victim of rape is an ``honest'' woman or an
``indecent'' one before reaching a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   A Peruvian judge is reported to have asked a victim: ``Are you a
virgin? And if you are not, why do you complain?'' With attitudes
like this, it is not surprising that women prefer to remain silent.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, those who file complaints face the sad fact that a
mere 15 percent of reported cases will be investigated. This is
hardly the first time Mexico City's police force has been accused
of rape. In 1990, five policemen were arrested for engaging in wild
rampages in which they raped 19 young women.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1991, El Financiero, one of the city's main
newspapers, reported on a woman who had been raped by policemen _
on three separate occasions. When Cristina Rivera Vargas testified
in a rental dispute against her landlady in court, she was
threatened: If she didn't retract her testimony, she would ``regret
it.'' Two days later, as she walked outside, an unidentified group
of men suggested that she do what her landlady had told her or
else, plain and simple, they would kill her. Less than two weeks
later, Rivera was forced inside a car, raped and left on the side
of the road.
</P>
<P>
   Bravely she filed a complaint.
</P>
<P>
   During the investigation, she identified one of her rapists: a
police officer. She was confident that justice would be served when
prosecutors attending her case assured her ``everything was going
well.'' A month later, Rivera was again abducted, taken to a house
complete with electric-shock torture devices and beaten
unconscious. She woke up next to a trash can.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera went back to the police, this time to drop the charges.
But the policemen continued to harass her, demanding extortion
money. They set a deadline for her to deliver the amount of cash
they wanted. She didn't. Three months later she was snatched again
from home. A young man found her, at five in the morning _
staggering by the train tracks, her hands tied, her mouth taped _
and took her to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera's case probably followed the same fate as most of
Mexico's rape complaints _ of those 15 percent that are
investigated, only 15 percent ever make it to a verdict. Rape is
not a serious felony _ not in Mexico and not in the rest of the
region. Until recently, most Latin American constitutions saw rape
as a crime against the state, not a crime committed against the
body and soul of one woman.
</P>
<P>
   A Latin woman does not only have to fear being raped by her
husband or by a policeman. She might very well find herself walking
down the aisle, marrying her own rapist. Fourteen Latin American
countries _ Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica,
Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru,
the Dominican Republic and Venezuela _ will acquit a rapist who
offers to marry the victim. In Costa Rica, the law is so extreme
that she doesn't even need to accept _ just the offer is enough.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the first opposition-party leader of
Mexico City in 70 years _ who is widely regarded as a presidential
frontrunner in 2000 _ has an opportunity to change the system, to
end the immunity with which rape is treated by Latin America's
justice systems. Indeed the director of the investigation has
announced she will ask for the maximum sentence of 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope that this case does not join the 85 percent of those
that never come to trial and that, if it is tried, it will not be
by men who put the onus on the victims. Or by men who think like
the Peruvian military general in ``Untold Terror: Violence Against
Women,'' a December '92 Human Rights Watch report, who said that
rape is an occasional regrettable ``excess'' committed by his
troops. ``Boys,'' he said, are far from their families and suffer a
great deal of tension because of the nature of combat. They get
their aggression out by raping women.''
</P>
<P>
   With protectors like this, where can a woman in Latin America
start feeling safe?

   Women in Latin America know they are alone when it comes to
protecting themselves against sexual crimes. But in few countries
are they as defenseless as in Mexico, where the police who are paid
to protect them often become the source of their terror.
</P>
<P>
   An entire battalion of the Mexican police _ 24 in all _ is being
accused of sexually abusing and raping three teen-age girls. Nine
of them have already been identified by the victims.
</P>
<P>
   The girls _ age 13, 15 and 18 _ were walking down the streets of
Xochimilco, a suburb of southern Mexico City, at 10 o'clock on July
19, a tranquil Sunday night. A police van stopped. The girls got
in. It is unclear whether the policemen stopped to ask the girls
for directions and then forced them in or if the girls needed
directions and got into the vehicle voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, once in the van, the three girls were driven to a
place that can only be described as hell _ a horse stable, property
of the police force. There, for four nights, they were forced to do
as they were told. They were humiliated by the many men in uniform
who dropped by and demanded to be served _ to be waited on and
cooked for. The girls were tortured and sexually molested. The
youngest two were raped.
</P>
<P>
   Today they are free _ and fortunate to be alive _ because the
18-year-old was able to escape and luckily found the rare policeman
who would listen to her and take action rather than join the tragic
escapade.
</P>
<P>
   The story, as pitiful and horrific as it is, is not surprising.
It stands as an indictment of the state of the police force in
Mexico, as well as a reminder of the fear women in Latin America
must live with every day.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers estimate that an average of 82 rapes are committed
in Mexico City daily. Few are reported. Mexican women, like other
women in Latin America, know they are on their own when it comes to
sexual crimes. The justice systems see rape with the same eyes and
the same attitudes that characterize most Latin men: husbands who
believe that demanding sex is a conjugal right or judges who first
will decide if the victim of rape is an ``honest'' woman or an
``indecent'' one before reaching a verdict.

   UNCONVENTIONAL-HOUSES (Santa Barbara, Calif.) _ Trophy houses,
the 20,000-square-foot status symbols, may get all the ink in ads
and the envy at cocktail parties, but the houses that are harder to
quantify and describe, the unconventional buildings with puzzling,
experimental or artistic qualities, are often the ones most likely
to throw a provocative curve at life. By Joseph Giovannini.
</P>
<P>
   CLEANING-LADY (Undated) _ Attention Jewish mothers: If you could
program your daughter's life, which of the following options would
you choose? A) Grow up in San Clemente, Calif., graduate from Lewis
and Clark College, earn a masters degree in comparative literature
at the University of California at Santa Cruz, publish articles and
essays in the Los Angeles Times, New York Times, Boston Phoenix and
Utne Reader, teach writing in Antioch's master of fine arts program
and write books. B) Become a cleaning lady. Not much of a choice,
you say? Well, what if she did both? Louise Rafkin has. She is the
author of ``Other People's Dirt: A Housecleaner's Curious
Adventures'' (Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill) and for eight years
she has supported her writing career by cleaning houses _ with her
eyes wide open and a notebook by her side. By Alex Witchel.

<P>
   NICKEL-DECORATE (Undated) _ There's a reason those hotshot 1980s
real estate developers were called brassy. They used a lot of
brass. But these days, for a lot of people, brass has no class.
``Now, we're more refined, more restrained,'' said William Lie
Zeckendorf, of the Zeckendorf development family. Brass is out.
Polished or brushed nickel is in. By Tracie Rozhon.

   NY-SCAFFOLDS (New York) _ Even before the accident at the Conde
Nast construction site on Times Square, the scaffolds and walls
around New York building sites radiated a sense of danger and
daring and lent an edge to the city. Like webs or cocoons, the
skeins and skins seem shockingly fragile by comparison to the

   NY-JAPANESE-GARDEN (Mill Neck, N.Y.) _ The John P. Humes
Japanese Stroll Garden here is a jade-green woodland retreat, open
to the public and perfect for August weekends. A visitor's internal
temperature falls at once on entering, thanks to the cool notes of
a Japanese flute, the icy music of a spring-fed waterfall, the
thoughtful pace of a tea ceremony and the shady walk _ first up and
then down the hill. By Mac Griswold.

   ZANESVILLE-POTTERY (Zanesville, Ohio) _ To the unschooled

This small Muskingum County town, population 26,000, is the

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Some people play favorites with the Bill of Rights.
 &HT;    The favorite amendment of gangsters is the fifth (no
self-incrimination), of liberals the first (free speech), of drug
dealers the fourth (no unauthorized search), of gun fondlers the
second (to bear arms).
 &HT;    Now, many people have a new favorite, the long-neglected 10th
(powers not specifically assigned to Washington are reserved to the
states). As recently as 1985, when the Supreme Court reversed one
of its rare decisions based on the amendment (Garcia canceling
Usery), the 10th was being called a dead letter. Certainly few
people tried to ``take the 10th'' the way gangsters and fellow
travelers ``took the fifth.''
 &HT;    But now the amendment has many takers. The Supreme Court used it
in 1992, 1995 and 1997 and shows an eagerness to extend that run.
Bob Dole, in his last year in the Senate, began carrying the words
of the amendment around with him for instant recitation. Newt
Gingrich's insurgents relied on it in 1994 to preach devolution of
power from the federal to the state level.
 &HT;    Even President Clinton gives states the title Louis Brandeis
thought up for them, ``laboratories of democracy.'' And Gov. Tommy
Thompson of Wisconsin thinks it is high time for the amendment to
be resurrected. He claims he has been a voice for the 10th crying
in the wilderness for many years.
 &HT;    The change is not just a matter of theory. States and localities
are manifesting a new energy, almost a frenzy, in starting,
altering or killing programs.
 &HT;    _ In education, they have pioneered charter schools, vouchers
for private schools, the canceling of affirmative action in
colleges, the retrenchment of bilingualism, new rules for immigrant
children, different approaches to truancy and various approaches to
teaching religion in public schools or allowing religious groups to
gather on public grounds.
 &HT;    _ In crime, states have reintroduced capital punishment and
passed ``three strikes'' laws. They have experimented with ``truth
in sentencing'' (no parole), mandatory sentencing, alternative
sentencing and victims' compensation.
 &HT;    _ In politics, they have promoted term limits, tax caps,
mandatory spending percentages, public campaign financing, the
control of union dues and extensions of the ballot initiative.
 &HT;    _ On sexual morality, the states have enacted or reversed bills
on gay rights, repealed sodomy laws, supported unmarried partners'
benefits and proposed or opposed marriage between homosexuals.
 &HT;    _ On welfare, the states have tried different forms of job
training and placement, compulsory work, public employment or
compensated private employment and various forms of benefits for
mothers on welfare (including child care and health insurance).
 &HT;    _ On the environment, they have regulated business, formed new
protected areas and successfully defied federal regulations (for
example, on the disposal of nuclear waste in New York vs. United
States in 1992).
 &HT;    _ On health, they have considered regulations on assisted
suicide, HMOs, late-term abortions and insurance affecting AIDS
patients.
 &HT;    _ On guns, they have passed bills to protect concealed weapons
or to impose local restrictions. They have defeated federal
restrictions on guns near schools (Lopez, 1995) and the attempt to
use local sheriffs to implement the Brady Bill (Printz, 1997).
 &HT;    On a whole range of such issues, the states have been out ahead
of federal programs, reversing a long-term trend. In the
Progressive era, regulation of corporations was sought at the
national level. In the Bull Moose movement, and during Woodrow
Wilson's first term, intellectuals aspired to policy roles in
Washington. With the New Deal, their drift toward the center became
a stampede. From that point on, an overlapping series of crises
(Depression, world war, Cold War) led to central mobilization and
control of resources.
 &HT;    But now, with the end of this half-century of crisis, people
with new ideas and a passion for public policy are turning away
from Washington and attacking social issues at the state and local
levels. This shift raises deep questions about the virtues of
direct democracy, the merits of federalism and the possibility of
isolating states from the national society.
 &HT;    California, as usual, has blundered furthest outward. Ronald
Reagan went forth from California to shrink the federal government
and essentially failed. Howard Jarvis stayed home in California and
succeeded. His Proposition 13 capped property taxes and thereby
(his critics allege) wrecked the state's public education system.
 &HT;    The state's punitive measures against immigrants and their
children have been checked by the courts, have backfired against
their sponsors (including Gov. Pete Wilson) and have unsettled
candidates dependent on Hispanic or Asian voters. Draconian term
limits (six years for Assembly members) were supposed to curtail
careerism, the power of special interests, cronyism and the
lobbyists' sway _ but have increased all four.
 &HT;    It is probably unfair to judge any movement by its effect in
California. Some local programs have shown initial promise _ school
vouchers in Ohio, charter schools in Arizona, inventive policing in
New York, job training in Michigan, public campaign financing in
Maine.
 &HT;    Much of the activity has been stimulated or guided by a new
generation of Republican governors, whose careers depend on making
the programs work. The emphasis on localism is partly a byproduct
of the fact that three-quarters of the American people now live
under Republican governors.
 &HT;    The foremost champion of local control among the governors is
Thompson, a short, chunky man from Elroy, Wis. (population 1,500),
who has a Cagney strut and very modest amounts of modesty. ``We
started it,'' he says. ``I was the front-runner because I started
looking at the federal laws and figuring how I'd go to Washington
and get waivers.'' Such waivers are special dispensations from
federal regulations. ``I'm the only governor who still has waivers
in existence, in the area of welfare, from Presidents Reagan, Bush
and Clinton. I think I've got 75 outstanding waivers, which changed
federal law in over 200 instances in the area of welfare.''
 &HT;    Welfare is not the only policy on which Thompson has been an
innovator. In education, he fought truancy with ``Learnfare'' and
set up choice schools, charter schools, ``prep tech'' and
apprenticing and high-school courses for college credit. He talks
of a ``broad menu'' of options for students. He clearly does not
think that local government has to mean minimal government.
 &HT;    In fact, his administration (begun in 1986) has been a kind of
mini-New Deal for proliferating programs, acronyms and slogans _
PFR (Parental and Family Responsibility), SSF (Self-Sufficiency
First), WEJT (Work Experience and Job Training Program), Work
First, Work Not Welfare, Children First. Many of these have been
folded into his master plan, implemented this year as W2 (shorthand
for WW, or Wisconsin Works).
 &HT;    His critics say that some of those plans have come and gone so
fast they are impossible to evaluate. But he says they should be
judged as steps toward his overall plan, whose parts are still
being assembled.
 &HT;    He has a health plan for the poor (Badger Care) that awaits more
waivers. (``President Clinton is setting on it now.'') His
job-training program is similarly stymied by Washington.
 &HT;    Thompson has moved further and faster than other governors in
taking control of his state's activities on many levels, but he
says he cannot be judged until his whole plan is in operation and
that will not happen until Washington unties his hands. Naturally,
since he thinks he is just beginning to get his schemes in place
after 12 years in the Governor's Mansion, he is adamantly opposed
to term limits: ``If you have people dumb enough to keep running
for office, like me, you should let the people decide.''
 &HT;    Thompson's central planning can look good if you consider the
California alternative. There, the governor's hands are tied, not
so much by Washington as by popular initiatives that have made a
traffic jam of election ballots.
 &HT;    In 1990, the state's ballot pamphlet setting forth the voters'
choices ran to 222 pages. At a city election in San Francisco,
there were more than 100 items. Voters, apparently, did not notice
that in 1988 they passed one measure for public financing of
campaigns (Proposition 68) and, simultaneously, another measure
(Proposition 73) outlawing it.
 &HT;    Nor is California alone in this sharpening appetite for
plebiscites. In 1996, 90 ballot initiatives were up for passage in
20 states. The referendum too is becoming more important, as
Maine's overthrow of a gay-rights law demonstrated.
 &HT;    The contrast between California's free-for-all and Wisconsin's
central planning shows that the cry for localism is not for a
single good thing (state government) against an equally monolithic
bad thing (the federal government). Local government can be
improvisational or controlled, experimental or rigid, or anything
in between.
 &HT;    Thompson is certainly not a champion of localism if that means
cities or counties or the State Legislature can defy his general
strategy. He boasts of the 290 items he vetoed in the first budget
submitted by the Legislature. He has used the line-item veto more
than 1,500 times.
 &HT;    Advocates of direct democracy, such as Robert Wiebe, the
political historian and theorist, oppose ``government by experts,''
and Thompson sometimes makes fun of Washington ``know-it-alls'' who
could not pass his ``Elroy test'' (what his little hometown knows
is good for it). But Thompson also boasts of his reliance on
experts, called in from all quarters to help him with planning.
 &HT;    One of those experts, Lawrence Mead, wants to make welfare ``the
new paternalism,'' frankly telling people what is good for them.
Temperamentally, Thompson is inclined to such hectoring certitude,
despite his populist campaign rhetoric.
 &HT;    I recently followed Thompson, who was out to greet some
constituents at the state environmental center. With men, he has
some of Mario Cuomo's locker-room bluster. (``Don't be a wimp.'')
With women, he is a palsy chin-chucker.
 &HT;    Despite the fact that both his parents were teachers and his
wife still is (sixth grade in Elroy), he uses what must pass as
``street talk'' in rural Wisconsin _ ``setting'' for sitting,
``oncommon'' for uncommon, ``secatary'' for secretary.
 &HT;    He presents himself as embattled and with few allies: ``I'm the
only one still talking devolution.'' The Republican Congress is
``as bad as the president.'' He feels that he has the spirit of
Fighting Bob La Follette, the Wisconsin progressive _ except that
La Follette went after big business and Thompson is a sworn foe of
big government (at least in Washington). If one of Thompson's
projects fails, he wants us to believe, it will be because of his
encirclement by foes.
 &HT;    To get a ``top down'' view of the states' new activism, I
interviewed President Clinton in April. He had just come in from a
Rose Garden announcement of his education program. Clinton, the
policy wonk, was eager to talk governmental relations even when
aides were trying to move him to the next event. He finds the
states'-rights activism a healthy development.
 &HT;    On the one hand, Clinton does not see the states shoving the
federal government off the scene so much as interacting with it in
new ways. But Clinton takes a surprisingly benign view of state
initiatives that express popular feeling rather than court-imposed
mandates.
 &HT;    ``I don't agree with a lot of those votes,'' he said, ``but I
think they're votes that people have the right to make as long as
they don't contravene a federal statute or the Constitution.
Usually there is a legitimate concern that these referenda are
designed to address. Either representative government is going to
have to move quickly into the breach when one of these proposals is
on the ballot, so that it is not necessary by election time, or the
progressive populists are going to have to put their own
counterproposals on the ballot. I don't think you can stop this
movement any time soon when people want to have a more direct say
on public issues.''
 &HT;    We can see, by counterpointing the remarks of the governor and
the president, that there is little prospect of agreement in detail
on the future of states' rights. The president is well disposed
toward ballot initiatives, the most direct form of democracy.
Thompson is uneasy about uncoordinated proposals that might intrude
on his master strategy.
 &HT;    Thompson thinks Washington has been too slow and niggardly in
turning over money. Clinton's liberal critics, by contrast, think
he was too quick to untie strings over welfare programs. The
president himself considered the Republican bill he signed too
sweeping on some matters, but feels he remedied that by restoring
food stamps and child-care provisions.
 &HT;    I asked him if he thinks that state welfare programs, spotty in
their success even during a prosperous time, will stand up when
economic reverses come.
 &HT;    ``Absolutely, as long as we keep the fundamental protection for
children. We had, in my view, state-by-state settling of
reimbursement for welfare families anyway.
 &HT;    ``Before I signed the welfare bill, the reimbursement schedule
for a family of three on welfare went from a low of $185 in
Mississippi and Texas to a high of $660 in Vermont, and most states
had welfare payments that were lower in real dollar terms,
considerably lower, than they had been in the early '70s, because
they had not kept up with inflation. So the Congress, long before I
came along, had de facto ceded the monthly payments to the states
anyway. Now the states are responsible.
 &HT;    ``In the old days, nobody had to take responsibility for the
welfare of the family and of the children, or whether there was a
work-based program. Everybody could always kick the responsibility
around. They could say that 'in our state the federal government
has all these rules _ and, oh, by the way, it's operated by the
county.' I think that locating responsibility and fixing it with
the states will be more positive than negative.''
 &HT;    It is here that Thompson gets heated in his comments on the
president. ``President Clinton has done everything he possibly can
to stymie what we're trying to do in Wisconsin.''
 &HT;    He has words just as harsh for Donna Shalala of Health and Human
Services. ``I could get matching grants'' for new programs,
Thompson complains _ but the government will not turn over the
money he feels he needs. On this point Thompson will get no help
from the federal courts. They have repeatedly ruled that states
have to observe federal conditions if they accept federal money.
 &HT;    So far, with the help of a booming economy in Wisconsin, the
governor has kept on top of things. When I suggest that federal
oversight might be justified by less commendable showings in other
states, he is dismissive.
 &HT;    ``They're always saying that, that the states were going to be
having a race to the bottom. I told them: 'You're wrong. That may
have happened in the '40s and '50s. But right now you've got
governors who are so darn competitive. They don't want to read that
they're not taking care of the poor, and they're not going to let a
governor in an adjoining state get ahead of them. We're very
competitive.'''
 &HT;    But the states are vulnerable to national forces too. Clinton
ended our interview by noticing how the hard line between domestic
and foreign policy is being dissolved. There is a parallel
softening of the division between state and national life, not just
in government but in every sphere.
 &HT;    This does not mean that states are not better at handling some
things or at conducting experiments not easily tried on a national
scale.
 &HT;    There will be, as Clinton says, new kinds of interaction,
dialogue and dispute. All that is healthy. But a 10th Amendment
fundamentalism that looks back to the muscular states of the
Jacksonian era is, by now, an exercise in nostalgia for ``good old
days'' that were not all that good.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Some people play favorites with the Bill of Rights.
 &HT;    The favorite amendment of gangsters is the fifth (no
self-incrimination), of liberals the first (free speech), of drug
dealers the fourth (no unauthorized search), of gun fondlers the
second (to bear arms).
 &HT;    Now, many people have a new favorite, the long-neglected 10th
(powers not specifically assigned to Washington are reserved to the
states). As recently as 1985, when the Supreme Court reversed one
of its rare decisions based on the amendment (Garcia canceling
Usery), the 10th was being called a dead letter. Certainly few
people tried to ``take the 10th'' the way gangsters and fellow
travelers ``took the fifth.''
 &HT;    But now the amendment has many takers. The Supreme Court used it
in 1992, 1995 and 1997 and shows an eagerness to extend that run.
Bob Dole, in his last year in the Senate, began carrying the words
of the amendment around with him for instant recitation. Newt
Gingrich's insurgents relied on it in 1994 to preach devolution of
power from the federal to the state level.
 &HT;    Even President Clinton gives states the title Louis Brandeis
thought up for them, ``laboratories of democracy.'' And Gov. Tommy
Thompson of Wisconsin thinks it is high time for the amendment to
be resurrected. He claims he has been a voice for the 10th crying
in the wilderness for many years.
 &HT;    The change is not just a matter of theory. States and localities
are manifesting a new energy, almost a frenzy, in starting,
altering or killing programs.
 &HT;    _ In education, they have pioneered charter schools, vouchers
for private schools, the canceling of affirmative action in
colleges, the retrenchment of bilingualism, new rules for immigrant
children, different approaches to truancy and various approaches to
teaching religion in public schools or allowing religious groups to
gather on public grounds.
 &HT;    _ In crime, states have reintroduced capital punishment and
passed ``three strikes'' laws. They have experimented with ``truth
in sentencing'' (no parole), mandatory sentencing, alternative
sentencing and victims' compensation.
 &HT;    _ In politics, they have promoted term limits, tax caps,
mandatory spending percentages, public campaign financing, the
control of union dues and extensions of the ballot initiative.
 &HT;    _ On sexual morality, the states have enacted or reversed bills
on gay rights, repealed sodomy laws, supported unmarried partners'
benefits and proposed or opposed marriage between homosexuals.
 &HT;    _ On welfare, the states have tried different forms of job
training and placement, compulsory work, public employment or
compensated private employment and various forms of benefits for
mothers on welfare (including child care and health insurance).
 &HT;    _ On the environment, they have regulated business, formed new
protected areas and successfully defied federal regulations (for
example, on the disposal of nuclear waste in New York vs. United
States in 1992).
 &HT;    _ On health, they have considered regulations on assisted
suicide, HMOs, late-term abortions and insurance affecting AIDS
patients.
 &HT;    _ On guns, they have passed bills to protect concealed weapons
or to impose local restrictions. They have defeated federal
restrictions on guns near schools (Lopez, 1995) and the attempt to
use local sheriffs to implement the Brady Bill (Printz, 1997).
 &HT;    On a whole range of such issues, the states have been out ahead
of federal programs, reversing a long-term trend. In the
Progressive era, regulation of corporations was sought at the
national level. In the Bull Moose movement, and during Woodrow
Wilson's first term, intellectuals aspired to policy roles in
Washington. With the New Deal, their drift toward the center became
a stampede. From that point on, an overlapping series of crises
(Depression, world war, Cold War) led to central mobilization and
control of resources.
 &HT;    But now, with the end of this half-century of crisis, people
with new ideas and a passion for public policy are turning away
from Washington and attacking social issues at the state and local
levels. This shift raises deep questions about the virtues of
direct democracy, the merits of federalism and the possibility of
isolating states from the national society.
 &HT;    California, as usual, has blundered furthest outward. Ronald
Reagan went forth from California to shrink the federal government
and essentially failed. Howard Jarvis stayed home in California and
succeeded. His Proposition 13 capped property taxes and thereby
(his critics allege) wrecked the state's public education system.
 &HT;    The state's punitive measures against immigrants and their
children have been checked by the courts, have backfired against
their sponsors (including Gov. Pete Wilson) and have unsettled
candidates dependent on Hispanic or Asian voters. Draconian term
limits (six years for Assembly members) were supposed to curtail
careerism, the power of special interests, cronyism and the
lobbyists' sway _ but have increased all four.
 &HT;    It is probably unfair to judge any movement by its effect in
California. Some local programs have shown initial promise _ school
vouchers in Ohio, charter schools in Arizona, inventive policing in
New York, job training in Michigan, public campaign financing in
Maine.
 &HT;    Much of the activity has been stimulated or guided by a new
generation of Republican governors, whose careers depend on making
the programs work. The emphasis on localism is partly a byproduct
of the fact that three-quarters of the American people now live
under Republican governors.
 &HT;    The foremost champion of local control among the governors is
Thompson, a short, chunky man from Elroy, Wis. (population 1,500),
who has a Cagney strut and very modest amounts of modesty. ``We
started it,'' he says. ``I was the front-runner because I started
looking at the federal laws and figuring how I'd go to Washington
and get waivers.'' Such waivers are special dispensations from
federal regulations. ``I'm the only governor who still has waivers
in existence, in the area of welfare, from Presidents Reagan, Bush
and Clinton. I think I've got 75 outstanding waivers, which changed
federal law in over 200 instances in the area of welfare.''
 &HT;    Welfare is not the only policy on which Thompson has been an
innovator. In education, he fought truancy with ``Learnfare'' and
set up choice schools, charter schools, ``prep tech'' and
apprenticing and high-school courses for college credit. He talks
of a ``broad menu'' of options for students. He clearly does not
think that local government has to mean minimal government.
 &HT;    In fact, his administration (begun in 1986) has been a kind of
mini-New Deal for proliferating programs, acronyms and slogans _
PFR (Parental and Family Responsibility), SSF (Self-Sufficiency
First), WEJT (Work Experience and Job Training Program), Work
First, Work Not Welfare, Children First. Many of these have been
folded into his master plan, implemented this year as W2 (shorthand
for WW, or Wisconsin Works).
 &HT;    His critics say that some of those plans have come and gone so
fast they are impossible to evaluate. But he says they should be
judged as steps toward his overall plan, whose parts are still
being assembled.
 &HT;    He has a health plan for the poor (Badger Care) that awaits more
waivers. (``President Clinton is setting on it now.'') His
job-training program is similarly stymied by Washington.
 &HT;    Thompson has moved further and faster than other governors in
taking control of his state's activities on many levels, but he
says he cannot be judged until his whole plan is in operation and
that will not happen until Washington unties his hands. Naturally,
since he thinks he is just beginning to get his schemes in place
after 12 years in the Governor's Mansion, he is adamantly opposed
to term limits: ``If you have people dumb enough to keep running
for office, like me, you should let the people decide.''
 &HT;    Thompson's central planning can look good if you consider the
California alternative. There, the governor's hands are tied, not
so much by Washington as by popular initiatives that have made a
traffic jam of election ballots.
 &HT;    In 1990, the state's ballot pamphlet setting forth the voters'
choices ran to 222 pages. At a city election in San Francisco,
there were more than 100 items. Voters, apparently, did not notice
that in 1988 they passed one measure for public financing of
campaigns (Proposition 68) and, simultaneously, another measure
(Proposition 73) outlawing it.
 &HT;    Nor is California alone in this sharpening appetite for
plebiscites. In 1996, 90 ballot initiatives were up for passage in
20 states. The referendum too is becoming more important, as
Maine's overthrow of a gay-rights law demonstrated.
 &HT;    The contrast between California's free-for-all and Wisconsin's
central planning shows that the cry for localism is not for a
single good thing (state government) against an equally monolithic
bad thing (the federal government). Local government can be
improvisational or controlled, experimental or rigid, or anything
in between.
 &HT;    Thompson is certainly not a champion of localism if that means
cities or counties or the State Legislature can defy his general
strategy. He boasts of the 290 items he vetoed in the first budget

 By JONATHAN VAN METER  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Long before ``South Park'' became the national phenomenon that
it is today, David Zucker had approached its creators _ Trey Parker
and Matt Stone _ with ``Baseketball,'' the first film he had
written in seven years.
 &HT;    Back in 1980, Zucker and his brother Jerry, outsiders in
Hollywood, had become something of a sensation with their first
movie, ``Airplane!'' _ a classic, with its memorably offensive
one-liners and ridiculous sight gags.
 &HT;    Over the years since, Zucker had grown frustrated by a climate
that seemed increasingly afraid of the outrageous, taboo-busting
humor that made ``Airplane!'' so fresh and funny. He sat out much
of the '90s before finally writing ``Baseketball,'' a goofy comedy
that aspired to be a satire about our national sports culture.
 &HT;    ``I think the best thing that happened to me,'' Zucker says,
``was to have Matt and Trey come along and say, `Well, you know,
``Baseketball'' is a great idea for a movie, but it's tame.' I just
went bananas. I was so embarrassed.''
 &HT;    ``We went to a couple of read-throughs,'' Stone says, ``and we
peppered a few lines with our humor, and it would get a big laugh.
We felt we had nothing to lose, so Trey and I started going off:
`This is a guy's movie. It's a sports parody. This is what every
guy lives through _ the whole sports, buddy, triumph-glory bull _
and we're making fun of a lot of that, and this is the way guys
talk.''
 &HT;    Zucker, who was a fan of Parker and Stone's student films and
had worked with them on a couple of shorts, had originally wanted
Parker to direct ``Baseketball,'' but he turned it down because he
was in the midst of starting work on ``South Park.''
 &HT;    One day, when Zucker and a producer were casting the film _
looking through a pile of head shots _ the producer said, ``What
about Trey Parker?'' Zucker thought it was an inspired idea, not
realizing that the producer meant the other Trey Parker _ a
modestly successful character actor. No matter. The mixup had
turned on a light: Zucker could hire Parker and Stone to play the
two buddies around whom the film turns and, for the same price,
exploit the spontaneous shenanigans that lie at the heart of the
Parker-Stone bond.
 &HT;    Because the two know each other and their idiosyncrasies so
well, Parker, 28, and Stone, 27, suggested things that no one else
could have thought of, things that predictably racheted up the
gross-and-shocking quotient. In one scene, for example, the two of
them are talking in the dugout and Parker is chewing a chaw of
tobacco. It was his idea to give it to Stone, who puts the tobacco
in his mouth and keeps right on chewing.
 &HT;    Jenny McCarthy, the former star of MTV's ``Singled Out,'' plays
a sort of young Zsa Zsa Gabor in ``Baseketball.'' No stranger to
grossness herself, McCarthy once posed for a shoe ad sitting on the
toilet reading a newspaper. ``They're kind of like any guy next
door _ just with a whole lot of talent,'' she says. ``We try to
battle each other to see who can talk the most disgusting. They're
so in line with my kind of humor, which is where I hope comedy is
going. They did a lot of improv in 'Baseketball.' It has a lot of
'South Park' touches to it.''
 &HT;    If ``Baseketball,'' which opens July 31, is a hit, it will be in
no small part because of Parker and Stone, who are in the odd,
perhaps unprecedented, position of being famous unknowns.
 &HT;    ``They come to it with the aura of their success,'' Zucker says.
``They have all that cachet because they're the authors of `South
Park.' People are already set to cheer for them. But they're
behind-the-scenes guys.''
 &HT;    Shortly before the release of `Baseketball,' I ask Stone if he's
looking forward to becoming a movie star. ``I'm totally
unprepared,'' he says. ``I hate the fact that I can't walk down the
street already without people looking at me. I went to this cheesy
bar last night and no 21-year-old Hollywood person was coming up
and going: `Heeey! Matt Stone!' I had the best time just sinking
into obscurity again, which is especially hard to do in LA.'' He
heaves a big sigh. ``We're going to Las Vegas this weekend, and I
know it's just going to be awful, walking around with everyone
yelling: `Hey! South Park! Can we get a picture?'''
 &HT;    No one could ever have guessed that ``South Park'' _ a crude,
funny, disturbing, adorable, obnoxious little cartoon on a cable
channel that millions of Americans still can't get _ would become
so huge so fast. What made the success of ``South Park'' different
from that of other adult animated series like ``The Simpsons'' and
``Beavis and Butthead'' is that it happened all at once.
 &HT;    The show made its debut last August and by December it was the
highest-rated show ever, by far, on Comedy Central _ as well as the
inspiration for the top-selling T-shirt in America. Parker and
Stone employ scatological humor fairly regularly; last year's
Christmas special, for example, featured a piece of talking,
singing feces named Mr. Hankey the Christmas Poo.
 &HT;    The most striking thing about ``South Park,'' which centers on a
group of boys in third grade, however, is its ability to pluck the
strings of fear and hatred in a surprisingly serious way. The show
plays with phobias in lines such as, ``Your mom's a Jew,'' ``Could
we get rid of all the Mexicans?'' and ``Asian culture has plagued
our fragile earth for many years. We must end it.''
 &HT;    These lines _ usually spoken by Parker and Stone and coming out
of the mouths of cartoon children _ are truly subversive. And yet,
nestled amid all the carnage (the same character dies a bloody
death in every episode) and hate speech, there is always a moral _
often of the touchy-feely, can't-we-all-just-get-along variety.
 &HT;    One of their best shows _ and Parker and Stone's favorite _ is
titled ''Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride,'' and features the
exaggerated, lisping character known as Big Gay Al. Stan, one of
the third-grade characters on the show, finds out that his dog is
gay and suffers endless mortification at the hands of his friends,
who shout, ``Stan's dog's a homo!''
 &HT;    Eventually, Stan learns about tolerance from Big Gay Al, and in
the end, all is well in South Park. What often keeps the show from
being offensive is this kind of sweetness _ and that it's funny.
 &HT;    In a recent, dicier episode, the four main characters travel to
China for a dodge-ball tournament. The Chinese announcers are drawn
in what can only be described as cartoon yellowface, while their
voices mock Asians speaking bad English. The twist is that the
Chinese announcers are making fun of American accents and ``big
eyes.'' It's a tricky game Parker and Stone are playing, and it
doesn't always work. ``That was a deep one,'' Stone says.
 &HT;    ``It's totally offensive. But we did it in a way to make a
point: turning it around. So it's us doing Chinese accents, making
fun of the Chinese, who are doing accents making fun of Americans.
It's just to say, `Who cares?'''
 &HT;    Good question, though a more precise inquiry might be: Does
everyone get it? Are some of the ``South Park'' fans simply
laughing at Jew jokes or goofy Chinese accents or gay stereotypes,
without the layers of irony that exist at the point of creation?
Probably. As with all comedy that dares to articulate the things
that people don't for fear of sounding mean or hateful, there's
always a chance that it might be dangerously misinterpreted _ or
misused.
 &HT;    Or, as they say, What about the children? Stone, who is Jewish,
says that people do get it, especially children _ who technically
aren't supposed to be watching. (The show comes on at 10 p.m.) He
cites, for example, a child who wrote to him that when he and his
classmates reenacted the Rosa Parks story in school, they imagined
the bus driver to be Cartman, the character on the show who says
the most horrible things.
 &HT;    Point: Kids know that Cartman is not be emulated, even though
repeating Cartman's offensive lines for laughs in school the next
day has become an adolescent pastime.
 &HT;    In some ways, it's like the Howard Stern debate of a few years
back: If Howard Stern is a good guy _ not the racist, sexist
homophobe his radio character so often is _ isn't it OK for him to
pretend that he's a terrible person? Just for laughs? The
difference, Parker and Stone would argue, is that their jokes have
context, where Stern's don't.
 &HT;    ``It comes back to telling a story,'' Stone says. ``The
combination of sweetness and real emotion and this totally bizarre
post-politically correct kind of brutality. Without one, you can't
have the other. That's how you suck people in _ with character and
story and emotion. We take a totally weird idea and try to mold it
into an afterschool-special kind of story.''
 &HT;    He mentions a scene that takes place at a football game. ``We
had the announcer say, 'Oh, I haven't seen a Jew run like that
since 1938.' Just a horrible thing to say. But there's a history of
sports announcers getting busted for things like that. The other
announcer says: `Dude! You can't say that! That's not cool!' If you
did that in the wrong way it would be very offensive. But I think
it's obvious when you watch `South Park' that we're saying we know
this is a stereotype and we're messing with that. When you don't
wink at the audience you really are guilty of perpetrating
something.''
 &HT;    One reason it is hard to be offended by the Parker-Stone
sensibility is that they are so earnest.
 &HT;    ``As bizarre as it is,'' says Parker of the show, ``there's this
overlying sweetness to it all. Like: `Hey, you know what? The
world's all right.' And I think that's because Matt and I are
really very happy and optimistic. It wouldn't work if we were
really dark, coffee-drinking, leather-jacket-wearing guys. It would
just be us making all these crass remarks about the world and it
would get old.''
 &HT;    Because ``Baseketball'' is the first Parker-Stone enterprise to
hit the street since ``South Park,'' there is intense excitement
among the show's legion of fans.
 &HT;    ``I haven't laughed that hard (intentionally) during a movie
since I saw `Airplane!' for the first time,'' wrote one young
critic on the Internet who saw an early test screening in
California. ``The movie was not (expletive) P.C.!!!!!! . . . This
movie is incredibly offensive. Many will hate it and will want it
banned.''
 &HT;    Part of what appeals about Parker and Stone is their spirit of
youthful rebellion, their desire, as Stone puts it, ``to flip off
the Man.''
 &HT;    Doug Herzog, the president and CEO of Comedy Central and the
person responsible for putting the show on the air, has given this
a lot of thought.
 &HT;    ``One of my late-night theories,'' he says, ``is that Matt and
Trey grew up on MTV, David Letterman - they're cool. But they've
been programmed to be cool. What they've never really had, because
their coolness is sort of marketed to them, is something to rebel
against. They don't get it in their rock music. I think you could
probably make the argument that `South Park' is rebellious. It's
something that your parents might not understand.''
 &HT;    Parker and Stone are members of a group of enlightened young
white guys who grew up being sensitive as a matter of course. Part
of what it means to be a New Young White Guy is to be assiduously
not racist, sexist or homophobic _ which is why Parker and Stone
give themselves permission to make insensitive jokes: They know
they're kidding. What they're rebelling against is being told to be
sensitive.
 &HT;    But where Herzog sees healthy rebellion, many critics see
immaturity. And while there is an undeniable intelligence at work,
the most disturbing thing about ``South Park'' isn't so much the
show itself as the horse it rode in on, what you might call Creep
Culture.
 &HT;    ``The Howard Stern Show,'' ''Beavis and Butthead,'' ``Dumb and
Dumber'' and ``South Park'' are all populated by jerks who say mean
things and treat people badly. You get the sense that the creative
minds behind these ventures were all picked on as children and _
deep down _ learned to identify with their tormentors. Only now, as
adults, hidden behind the characters they invent, can they get back
at the bully.
 &HT;    What pushes ``South Park'' above the fray is that the characters
Parker and Stone have invented are third-grade boys _ a group for
whom such obnoxious behavior is to be expected, perhaps even
forgiven.

 By JONATHAN VAN METER  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Long before ``South Park'' became the national phenomenon that
it is today, David Zucker had approached its creators _ Trey Parker
and Matt Stone _ with ``Baseketball,'' the first film he had
written in seven years.
 &HT;    Back in 1980, Zucker and his brother Jerry, outsiders in
Hollywood, had become something of a sensation with their first
movie, ``Airplane!'' _ a classic, with its memorably offensive
one-liners and ridiculous sight gags.
 &HT;    Over the years since, Zucker had grown frustrated by a climate
that seemed increasingly afraid of the outrageous, taboo-busting
humor that made ``Airplane!'' so fresh and funny. He sat out much
of the '90s before finally writing ``Baseketball,'' a goofy comedy
that aspired to be a satire about our national sports culture.
 &HT;    ``I think the best thing that happened to me,'' Zucker says,
``was to have Matt and Trey come along and say, `Well, you know,
``Baseketball'' is a great idea for a movie, but it's tame.' I just
went bananas. I was so embarrassed.''
 &HT;    ``We went to a couple of read-throughs,'' Stone says, ``and we
peppered a few lines with our humor, and it would get a big laugh.
We felt we had nothing to lose, so Trey and I started going off:
`This is a guy's movie. It's a sports parody. This is what every
guy lives through _ the whole sports, buddy, triumph-glory bull _
and we're making fun of a lot of that, and this is the way guys
talk.''
 &HT;    Zucker, who was a fan of Parker and Stone's student films and
had worked with them on a couple of shorts, had originally wanted
Parker to direct ``Baseketball,'' but he turned it down because he
was in the midst of starting work on ``South Park.''
 &HT;    One day, when Zucker and a producer were casting the film _
looking through a pile of head shots _ the producer said, ``What
about Trey Parker?'' Zucker thought it was an inspired idea, not
realizing that the producer meant the other Trey Parker _ a
modestly successful character actor. No matter. The mixup had
turned on a light: Zucker could hire Parker and Stone to play the
two buddies around whom the film turns and, for the same price,
exploit the spontaneous shenanigans that lie at the heart of the
Parker-Stone bond.
 &HT;    Because the two know each other and their idiosyncrasies so
well, Parker, 28, and Stone, 27, suggested things that no one else
could have thought of, things that predictably racheted up the
gross-and-shocking quotient. In one scene, for example, the two of
them are talking in the dugout and Parker is chewing a chaw of
tobacco. It was his idea to give it to Stone, who puts the tobacco
in his mouth and keeps right on chewing.
 &HT;    Jenny McCarthy, the former star of MTV's ``Singled Out,'' plays
a sort of young Zsa Zsa Gabor in ``Baseketball.'' No stranger to
grossness herself, McCarthy once posed for a shoe ad sitting on the

so in line with my kind of humor, which is where I hope comedy is
going. They did a lot of improv in 'Baseketball.' It has a lot of
'South Park' touches to it.''
 &HT;    If ``Baseketball,'' which opens July 31, is a hit, it will be in
no small part because of Parker and Stone, who are in the odd,
perhaps unprecedented, position of being famous unknowns.
 &HT;    ``They come to it with the aura of their success,'' Zucker says.

 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    There was nothing out of the ordinary about the slender glass
tubes of blood that arrived in Sharon S. Rotun's laboratory late in
the afternoon of March 20, 1998.
 &HT;    A pale, stocky woman with the impatient manner of someone who is
overworked and underpaid, Rotun was the microbiology supervisor at
United Hospital Medical Center, a small community hospital in the
working-class town of Port Chester, N.Y., just north of Manhattan
in Westchester County.
 &HT;    The two blood cultures were among roughly a dozen sent to the
lab that day. Whoever ordered the testing was evidently in a hurry,
Rotun recalls, because he or she hadn't even bothered to scribble
the usual instructions on the accompanying slip.
 &HT;    The blood belonged to a 79-year-old Westchester County man, a
retired New York City narcotics detective who had been admitted to
the hospital earlier that day. For the past year and a half, the
detective's kidneys had been failing him, a condition that required
him to undergo dialysis three times a week.
 &HT;    On most days, he tolerated the tedious procedure with a smile.
But on the morning of March 20, the retired detective awoke in an
unusually sour mood.
 &HT;    ``He didn't want to eat; he didn't want to get dressed; he
didn't want to get washed,'' said his daughter Carole, who agreed
to be interviewed on the condition that she be identified only by
her first name and that her father not be identified at all.
 &HT;    She got him dressed, quickly served him breakfast and, despite
his protests, sent him to the local dialysis center. ``You have to
go,''' the daughter told him. ``You have no choice.''
 &HT;    The old man was feverish, short of breath and so disoriented he
could barely speak by the time the kidney specialist, Dr. Sam
Natarajan, saw him. Natarajan immediately suspected staphylococcus
aureas, a bacteria that frequently causes illness among dialysis
patients, who become infected when the microbes enter the
bloodstream along their intravenous lines.
 &HT;    The doctor performed just enough dialysis to clear the fluid
backed up in his patient's lungs _ a ``dry cleaning,'' in the argot
of renal disease _ and then called an ambulance to take the man to
the hospital. Twelve hours later, the patient was dead.
 &HT;    In what turned out to be the final hours of his life, the ailing
detective was hooked up to an intravenous drip of vancomycin, a
powerful antibiotic that has been the ultimate weapon against staph
for the last three decades. Doctors regard vancomycin as the drug
of last resort, the medicine they rely on to kill germs that are
too vicious to respond to anything else. Normally, vancomycin
begins attacking staph in the bloodstream immediately.
 &HT;    ``We call vancomycin `the big gun,''' Rotun says. Which is why,
when she first examined the lab results from the dead detective,
she did not believe what she saw.
 &HT;    A staph infection was indeed flourishing in the detective's
blood when he died. But not just any strain of staph. This was a
rare and unusually dangerous germ, a supermicrobe that
infectious-disease experts have been dreading for years. It goes by
the name of VISA, for Vancomycin Intermediate-Resistant
Staphylococcus Aureas, and it represents the bacterial world's most
potent counterattack against antibiotics.
 &HT;    As soon as the results of the detective's blood tests came in,
Rotun posted signs all over her laboratory, instructing her
subordinates not to give out any information. The last thing the
hospital needed, she thought, was a swarm of reporters generating
panic over a killer superbug that could be spreading through the
hospital's corridors.
 &HT;    Not even Carole, the detective's daughter, was told. Instead,
Rotun repeated the lab tests. Then, when she had convinced herself
there was no mistake, she picked up the phone and called her
longtime colleague and friend, Ginny McMath, United Hospital's
infection control officer.
 &HT;    ```I hope you're sitting down,''' Rotun told McMath. ``I think
we have the first VISA in New York State.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    In recent years, it has become fashionable in the media to warn
of the exotic new infectious diseases percolating in faraway lands.
The gruesome Ebola virus, which swept through Zaire three years
ago, has captured the public imagination in books and on film. But
while Hollywood has been busy making scary movies,
infectious-disease experts know that the bigger danger is in our
own backyard: garden variety germs that for decades have been so
easily felled by antibiotics that most people, including some
scientists, naively assumed they were no longer a threat.
 &HT;    For the past decade, however, scientists at the Federal Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and all over the
world have been sounding alarm bells about the growth of antibiotic
resistance, a problem that has been fueled by patients who demand
antibiotics for every bout of the sniffles and by doctors who give
in to such demands. The list of dangerously virulent drug-resistant
microbes is growing all the time: streptococcus pneumoniae, which
causes pneumonia, childhood ear infections and meningitis;
mycobacterium tuberculosis, which causes TB, and neisseria
gonorrhoeae, which causes gonorrhea.
 &HT;    But none are as frightening to medical experts as the VISA
strains of staph. Within the past 18 months, the CDC has documented
the first four cases ever, the most recent being that of the New
York detective. Their emergence is an ominous harbinger of what Dr.
Stuart B. Levy, director of the Center for Adaptation Genetics and
Drug Resistance at Tufts, calls ``the worst thing that could happen
in clinical infectious disease.''
 &HT;    One reason for concern is that staph is a particularly common
and robust organism; it lives on the skin and in the nostrils of
otherwise healthy people as part of what scientists call the
``natural flora,'' where it is relatively harmless. But if it gains
access to the body through scrapes, cuts or surgical incisions, as
it often does, it can cause a range of ailments, from pus-oozing
cuts to sepsis, an often lethal infection of the bloodstream.
 &HT;    Children who scrape their knees are susceptible to staph, as are
housewives who cut their hands in the kitchen or anybody else with
an open wound. Should VISA strains become common, simple cuts and
scrapes could become mortal wounds.
 &HT;    To complicate matters, hospitals are already breeding grounds
for a host of dangerous bugs. Each year, nearly 90,000 patients in
the United States die of a hospital-acquired infection, and many of
those cases are theoretically treatable with antibiotics. Staph is
often the culprit, picking on vulnerable patients such as the
elderly, the immunocompromised and those undergoing surgery. The
emergence of an untreatable strain of staph would put virtually any
healthy person at risk, and could turn a bad situation into a
disastrous one.
 &HT;    As Levy says, ``Right now, we are still in most cases able to
use vancomycin. Now let's say we lose vancomycin. Where are the
deaths going to go? They're going to go up. This number could
double.''
 &HT;    Now that these bugs are figuring out ways to evade the very
miracle drugs that have always worked so well against them, there
is little on the horizon to keep the virulent new supergerms in
check. Joshua Lederberg, a Rockefeller University professor who is
widely regarded as one of the nation's leading authorities on
infectious disease, warns that far too little attention is being
paid to the threat of drug-resistant germs.
 &HT;    ``The odds of Ebola breaking out are quite low, but the stakes
are very high,'' Lederberg says. ``With antibiotic resistance, the
odds are certain and the stakes are just as high. It is happening
right under our noses.''
 &HT;    And it is happening at a particularly precarious moment, when
many hospitals are cutting back on services as they struggle to
survive the changing economics of health care. United Hospital in
Port Chester, for example, reflecting national trends, plans to
``outsource'' Rotun's lab. Meanwhile, drug manufacturers, which in
the early 1980s all but abandoned development of new antibiotics on
the theory that they were no longer needed, find themselves behind
the curve. They are hustling to invent new treatments and put them
on pharmacy shelves. And that is why the emergence of the
vancomycin-resistant strains is viewed as such a worrisome public
health threat.
 &HT;    The next generation of new antimicrobials is, by the industry's
own estimate, at least several years away, creating a dangerous
window in which the virulent new microbes might be able to spread
unchecked. If that happens, modern medicine might revert to the
days before penicillin, when sore throats could become fatal and
patients who walked into the hospital for routine surgery might be
carried out in coffins.
 &HT;    ``If we have no antibiotics, it reopens the whole question of
intrusive surgical procedures and vastly changes the calculus of
their safety,'' Lederberg says. In the pre-penicillin era, people
occasionally died while having their appendixes removed _ not
because the surgery itself was dangerous but because germs crept
into the patients' incisions, causing infections that spread to the
bloodstream and raged out of control.
 &HT;    ``Those days,'' Lederberg says, ``have a chance of coming back
if the drugs we have been relying on just stop working.''
 &HT;    As the race to find new drugs proceeds, supermicrobes such as
the one that infected the New York detective will undoubtedly
continue to flourish, leaving a trail of nervous public-health
officials and grieving families in their wake.
 &HT;    Three days after the former detective died, mourners gathered at
a stately stone church in the town of Harrison. On that same day,
with utmost secrecy, officials at United Hospital were frantically
trying to determine where the vancomycin-resistant staph bug came
from and, more important, whether the germ had spread.
 &HT;    The unenviable job of getting to the bottom of those questions
fell to Ginny McMath, the hospital's infection-control official.
The name of the detective was familiar to her; she remembered him
from a previous admission in January, when he was treated for a
staph infection that was resistant to methicillin.
 &HT;    He was given vancomycin for several weeks, but the episode
earned him an entry into a red loose-leaf binder where McMath
carefully catalogues every instance of a drug-resistant strain at
the hospital. The case fell under the worrisome category of MRSA _
methicillin resistant staph aureas.
 &HT;    When Rotun called with news of the detective's blood tests,
McMath was alarmed but not altogether surprised. A 79-year-old man
with a history of kidney disease and methicillin-resistant staph,
she knew, was the optimal candidate for a VISA strain.
 &HT;    ``It's sort of like the natural experiment that we would do in
the laboratory except that in this case, the patient is the Petri
dish,'' explains Fred C. Tenover, chief of the CDC's Nosocomial
Pathogens Laboratory Branch, the national reference laboratory for
hospital-acquired, or nosocomial, infections.
 &HT;    McMath immediately began to track down everyone who had contact
with the detective in the days before he died. Working with
Natarajan, the kidney specialist, she identified 44 people _
dialysis workers, doctors, nurses and family members _ who might
have been exposed to the deadly microbe. Each had their nostrils
and, in some cases, their hands cultured to see if they were
``colonized'' with the bug.
 &HT;    Making the notifications was a delicate task. The cause of the
detective's death had not been made public, and Natarajan and
McMath were careful not to reveal too much.
 &HT;    ``There's a fear that people won't want to come here,'' McMath
said. It was left to Natarajan to call the detective's family. ``I
told them that he had a staph infection, but there was a
peculiarity and we wanted to see if anybody else had the same type
of infection,'' he said. ``I didn't want to cause them any panic.''
 &HT;    That instinct _ not to cause panic _ is an understandable one,
experts say, but it can also lead to public-health problems of its
own. Suppressing information about a potentially deadly germ might
lead people who have been exposed to it not to take the testing
seriously. Indeed, Carole's daughter declined at first to be
cultured, thinking it was unnecessary.
 &HT;    On April 24, one month to the day after the detective's funeral,
Carole was driving to work when she heard a report over the car
radio that an elderly dialysis patient in Port Chester had died of
a rare staph infection. Her father was not identified, but it did
not take much to put two and two together.
 &HT;    ``I didn't realize how serious a bacteria it was until I heard
it on the radio,'' she said. ``It really upset me that they were
not more forthcoming.''
 &HT;    As it turned out, 14 of the 44 people who were tested were
carrying staph aureas. Of the 14, 2 _ a doctor and a patient _
harbored a germ that was resistant to methicillin. Genetic typing
conducted by Tenover's lab, however, found that none of these bugs
were identical to the one that infected Carole's father. It was an
encouraging sign; the deadly bug, it seems, is buried with the
detective.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, McMath's investigation, supervised by both state
health officials and the CDC, quickly established that neither the
hospital nor the dialysis center was a problem. Dr. David Ackman,
who directs the state's Bureau of Communicable Disease Control,
said infection control practices were meticulous at both. Even so,
Ackman said: ``We were very concerned. We wanted to make sure that
there weren't other people carrying this around.''
 &HT;    Ackman and other infectious-disease experts no longer view these
episodes as isolated incidents. They are more like bullets that are
becoming increasingly difficult to dodge. ``We were lucky,'' says
Tenover, who has no trouble spinning out scenarios for the near
future that are far worse.
 &HT;    ``The next time it may be somebody who is on an open hospital
ward, or maybe they have been in the hospital for several weeks, or
been a lot of places before their infection is recognized. Or it
might be someone in a nursing home that can spread it among 80
patients, in which case we are going to have a big job on our
hands.''

 FROM: The Boston Globe Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    History has it that the first thing Alexander Graham Bell said
over the telephone was: ``Mr. Watson, come here, I want you.''
 &HT;    What he would say today is: ``Hey, just checkin' in. Get back to
me whenever.''
 &HT;    Americans don't communicate with each other anymore. We check
in. We whip out our vest-pocket cellulars, punch in the digits and
give our coordinates, as if we're at a Loran station somewhere.
 &HT;    Hi. I'm 32,000 feet over Lake Erie ... I'm sitting in the bar
car on the 5:04 to Darien ... I'm at a pay phone across from Gate
41B on Concourse D at O'Hare ... I'm on the ferry to the Vineyard
... I'm in the passing lane between West Newton and the Weston
tolls ... I'm in the middle of the seventh-inning stretch at Yankee
Stadium. Just checkin' in ...
 &HT;    Checking in used to be a California thing.
 &HT;    ``I'll be at 526-7981 for the next hour,'' the Tony Roberts
character says over the phone in ``Play It Again, Sam,'' while
Woody Allen, the exasperated New Yorker, rolls his eyes. ``Then
I'll be at 696-0706 until after lunch. Then you can reach me at
237-7921 ...''
 &HT;    Now, it's become the national pastime. A satellite goes on the
fritz for a couple of hours, and we wail and shake our beepers at
the heavens because we can't check in or tell who's trying to check
in with us.
 &HT;    We may fantasize about escaping to a bungalow on a Caribbean
isle with no electrical outlets, blissfully ignorant of the Dow and
the latest White House scandal. But when Hurricane Herbie hits the
Cape and knocks out our power for 72 hours, we start banging on our
neighbors' doors, craving external contact.
 &HT;    Since we have the gadgets _ the car phones and Airfones and
voice mails and e-mails and pagers and digicams linked to laptops _
we can't bear to be incommunicado. There's no need for it anymore.
 &HT;    More than that, there's no excuse for it. To have one's beeper
or cellular switched off, to avoid picking up one's messages, is to
go Garbo. It's inefficient, antisocial and damned inconsiderate.
The option of staying in touch, or even being reachable, has become
an obligation.
 &HT;    No doubt, much of our checking in is worthwhile, even necessary.
We need to tell our 12 o'clock appointment that we're gridlocked
across town. We want to let our spouse know that the Little League
practice has been called off and save her a 45-minute diversion. We
have to tell whomever the Sears deliveryman checks in with that we
won't be at home between 10 and 11 after all and don't want the
Lady Kenmore dumped on the front lawn.
 &HT;    But much of the time, we seem to be checking in because we can.
We're fascinated by our teletoys and delighted with the freedom
they give us. Those old barriers of time and space have vanished.
We can check in from anywhere with anyone any time we please. So we
do. Hey, you'll never guess where I'm calling you from ...
 &HT;    What we're saying isn't nearly as important as the fact that
we're saying it. The message is merely an excuse to use the medium.
We don't merely check in with one another. We check in with the
Internet and television too, fingering our mouses and remotes,
clicking and zapping. Even the verbs we use to describe our
activities _ surfing, browsing, grazing _ speak to the superficial,
the transitory. We've become human hummingbirds, flitting and
hovering, dipping in our beaks for a quick taste, then zipping off.
 &HT;    We check in with 60 cable channels in 20 seconds, stopping to
absorb the latest update on the New York-Baltimore game as it pops
up on the CNN streamer, then surfing the endless wave from 2
through 99 and back to 2.
 &HT;    We don't miss a thing, but how much do we retain amid the
relentless input, the hundreds of images, the factoids, the sound
snippets? We've confused information with knowledge; we know less
and less about more and more.
 &HT;    All this checking in has made us twitchy and perfunctory. We
jump at the sound of a beep, then put that beep on hold to answer
another beep. We'd rather leave a 15-second message than have a
five-minute discussion, because five minutes is what an hour used
to be.
 &HT;    We don't have time, or we think we don't, for depth, for
reflection, for the provocative give-and-take of a conversation
that stimulates and satisfies. We take our frenetic tempo from
computers that deal in nano-seconds and from television, with its
sound bites, quick cuts and happy talk.
 &HT;    Our grandparents didn't have the luxury, or the curse, of
instant global communication. Their world was smaller and slower by
necessity. They didn't know anybody they hadn't met, and they saw
and spoke with the same people on a daily basis. They didn't need
to check in.
 &HT;    Their world _ a city block, a rural village _ may have seemed
mundane and limiting to them at times, but it provided them with a
leisurely, face-to-face intimacy and the assurance that they would
find out most of what was important to them. Our world, for better
but mostly for worse, is nothing like that.
 &HT;    Our teletoys have put us in touch _ theoretically, anyway _ with
an endless number of people and an infinite amount of information
that is constantly being updated. If we're incommunicado for very
long, we risk missing _ who knows what?
 &HT;    So we can't afford to be out of touch, or to hover in one place
for too long. That's why we pay for call waiting, why we feel
compelled to disengage from the conversation we're in on the random
chance that a pending one might be more important. The future
always seems more intriguing to us than the present, especially if
it won't stop clicking.
 &HT;    The electronic scolds that were created as our servants _ the
chirping cell phone, the shrieking pager, the flashing MESSAGE
PENDING, the blinking red light on the phone console, the
stentorian voice declaring ``You've got mail'' _ have become our
masters. URGENT! they command. DROP EVERYTHING THIS VERY MINUTE!
 &HT;    So we do, because the scolds have made jittery compulsives of
us. We feel negligent, even guilty, if we don't interrupt what
we're doing to respond immediately. Then we check our e-mail, only
to find an ad telling us how we can get rid of unwanted e-mail.
 &HT;    Back before telephones and telegraphs, time and distance
precluded checking in for its own sake. In Jesus' time, it took 46
days to travel from Rome to Jerusalem. It took weeks for King
George III to hear about the Boston Tea Party, and weeks more to do
anything about it. The Pony Express, which still took 10 days to
bring mail from Missouri to California, charged $5 an ounce in
1860. Nobody used it just to say hi.
 &HT;    Communication was more deliberate and less trivial precisely
because time and distance demanded it. Now that we can reach out
and touch someone (and vice versa) in a millisecond, the teletoys
have distorted our sense not only of time and distance, but
importance. Because we have achieved instant communication, we
expect instant response, whether or not it's merited. The form and
content of the response scarcely matter. What we're after is not so
much communication as acknowledgment.
 &HT;    To not carry a cell phone or a pager, to not have voice mail, to
not be on line, is to all but declare yourself a hermit. The
concept of being out of touch, literally unreachable, no longer
exists. It's considered Luddite even to desire it. What do you
mean, I can't reach you?
 &HT;    The sad thing is, we've confused reaching with communicating.
All too often, we make the connection and realize we have nothing
worth saying. If so much of our checking in seems hurried,
perfunctory and shallow, it may be that we have no need, or desire,
to have a conversation in the first place.
 &HT;    Or perhaps we've lost the skills or don't grasp the form
anymore. The success of the film ``My Dinner With Andre'' was
considered remarkable _ who thought American audiences would sit
still for two characters (especially middle-age males) having an
expansive conversation over a meal? And that was in 1981, when
cable was still a novelty and the Internet an academic plaything.
 &HT;    The most notable thing about that conversation was that it was
face-to-face. It could not have happened over the Internet and
probably not by phone. The nuances, the natural rhythms and pauses,
the heads nodding and shaking, would have been lost.
 &HT;    The gadgets we invented to make conversation easier inhibit real
conversation by their very nature. Their speed encourages
superficiality because we can dial up or log on before we have
anything to say. Their portability allows us to check in while
we're doing something else _ driving a car, shopping for groceries,
watching a ballgame. So undivided attention has become an oxymoron.
 &HT;    Since we can reach people without reaching them, just by leaving
a detailed message after the tone, we don't need a conversation. In
fact, the whole idea can be not to have a conversation, but to
return the obligation to have one.
 &HT;    That's why so many business executives leave voice mails at 5:40
p.m. from their car phones, knowing that their intended recipient
has already left for the day. It's the checking-in version of
``Tag, you're it!''
 &HT;    Teletoys were designed to bring the remote into proximity (``Mr.
Watson, come here''). The truth is, they merely create the illusion
of proximity while keeping us at a distance. All we leave is a
scent _ a disembodied voice scratchy with tunnel static, a rambling
run-on paragraph on a cyberscreen, a pager number that seems
vaguely familiar.
 &HT;    We can leave that scent from the other side of the planet, where
today is already yesterday _ or not quite tomorrow. We don't feel
that we need to connect; time and space make that impractical
anyway. We check in, and we check out. The global village we talk
about is more of a global hotel.
 &HT;    Yet even if we do connect _ and sometimes we're caught
unprepared when we do, surprised that the person we're calling has
actually answered _ we're still at a remove. Our teletoys may erase
time and distance, but we remain remote, unseen. We miss all of the
visual cues that have always helped humans understand (and not
misunderstand) one another.
 &HT;    The Internet chat room is the epitome of checking in. We sit by
ourselves and log on to the world with a screen name. We send
cryptic messages to strangers we ``know'' because we've been on
line with them before, but who may not be anything like who they
say they are.
 &HT;    We all talk at once, and a computer chip decides who has
priority. We talk in lower-case fragments, in acronyms. We talk to
names who leave the room before we know they've clicked off and
checked in elsewhere. No matter. Somebody else will be checking in.
The chat room is always full.

 &HT;    
 By JOHN POWERS  
 FROM: The Boston Globe Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    History has it that the first thing Alexander Graham Bell said
over the telephone was: ``Mr. Watson, come here, I want you.''
 &HT;    What he would say today is: ``Hey, just checkin' in. Get back to
me whenever.''
 &HT;    Americans don't communicate with each other anymore. We check
in. We whip out our vest-pocket cellulars, punch in the digits and
give our coordinates, as if we're at a Loran station somewhere.
 &HT;    Hi. I'm 32,000 feet over Lake Erie ... I'm sitting in the bar
car on the 5:04 to Darien ... I'm at a pay phone across from Gate
41B on Concourse D at O'Hare ... I'm on the ferry to the Vineyard
... I'm in the passing lane between West Newton and the Weston
tolls ... I'm in the middle of the seventh-inning stretch at Yankee
Stadium. Just checkin' in ...
 &HT;    Checking in used to be a California thing.
 &HT;    ``I'll be at 526-7981 for the next hour,'' the Tony Roberts
character says over the phone in ``Play It Again, Sam,'' while
Woody Allen, the exasperated New Yorker, rolls his eyes. ``Then
I'll be at 696-0706 until after lunch. Then you can reach me at
237-7921 ...''
 &HT;    Now, it's become the national pastime. A satellite goes on the
fritz for a couple of hours, and we wail and shake our beepers at
the heavens because we can't check in or tell who's trying to check
in with us.
 &HT;    We may fantasize about escaping to a bungalow on a Caribbean
isle with no electrical outlets, blissfully ignorant of the Dow and
the latest White House scandal. But when Hurricane Herbie hits the
Cape and knocks out our power for 72 hours, we start banging on our
neighbors' doors, craving external contact.
 &HT;    Since we have the gadgets _ the car phones and Airfones and
voice mails and e-mails and pagers and digicams linked to laptops _
we can't bear to be incommunicado. There's no need for it anymore.
 &HT;    More than that, there's no excuse for it. To have one's beeper
or cellular switched off, to avoid picking up one's messages, is to
go Garbo. It's inefficient, antisocial and damned inconsiderate.
The option of staying in touch, or even being reachable, has become
an obligation.
 &HT;    No doubt, much of our checking in is worthwhile, even necessary.
We need to tell our 12 o'clock appointment that we're gridlocked
across town. We want to let our spouse know that the Little League
practice has been called off and save her a 45-minute diversion. We
have to tell whomever the Sears deliveryman checks in with that we
won't be at home between 10 and 11 after all and don't want the
Lady Kenmore dumped on the front lawn.
 &HT;    But much of the time, we seem to be checking in because we can.
We're fascinated by our teletoys and delighted with the freedom
they give us. Those old barriers of time and space have vanished.
We can check in from anywhere with anyone any time we please. So we
do. Hey, you'll never guess where I'm calling you from ...
 &HT;    What we're saying isn't nearly as important as the fact that
we're saying it. The message is merely an excuse to use the medium.
We don't merely check in with one another. We check in with the
Internet and television too, fingering our mouses and remotes,
clicking and zapping. Even the verbs we use to describe our
activities _ surfing, browsing, grazing _ speak to the superficial,
the transitory. We've become human hummingbirds, flitting and
hovering, dipping in our beaks for a quick taste, then zipping off.
 &HT;    We check in with 60 cable channels in 20 seconds, stopping to
absorb the latest update on the New York-Baltimore game as it pops
up on the CNN streamer, then surfing the endless wave from 2
through 99 and back to 2.
 &HT;    We don't miss a thing, but how much do we retain amid the
relentless input, the hundreds of images, the factoids, the sound
snippets? We've confused information with knowledge; we know less
and less about more and more.
 &HT;    All this checking in has made us twitchy and perfunctory. We
jump at the sound of a beep, then put that beep on hold to answer
another beep. We'd rather leave a 15-second message than have a
five-minute discussion, because five minutes is what an hour used
to be.
 &HT;    We don't have time, or we think we don't, for depth, for
reflection, for the provocative give-and-take of a conversation
that stimulates and satisfies. We take our frenetic tempo from
computers that deal in nano-seconds and from television, with its
sound bites, quick cuts and happy talk.
 &HT;    Our grandparents didn't have the luxury, or the curse, of
instant global communication. Their world was smaller and slower by
necessity. They didn't know anybody they hadn't met, and they saw
and spoke with the same people on a daily basis. They didn't need
to check in.
 &HT;    Their world _ a city block, a rural village _ may have seemed
mundane and limiting to them at times, but it provided them with a
leisurely, face-to-face intimacy and the assurance that they would
find out most of what was important to them. Our world, for better
but mostly for worse, is nothing like that.
 &HT;    Our teletoys have put us in touch _ theoretically, anyway _ with
an endless number of people and an infinite amount of information
that is constantly being updated. If we're incommunicado for very
long, we risk missing _ who knows what?
 &HT;    So we can't afford to be out of touch, or to hover in one place
for too long. That's why we pay for call waiting, why we feel
compelled to disengage from the conversation we're in on the random
chance that a pending one might be more important. The future
always seems more intriguing to us than the present, especially if
it won't stop clicking.
 &HT;    The electronic scolds that were created as our servants _ the
chirping cell phone, the shrieking pager, the flashing MESSAGE
PENDING, the blinking red light on the phone console, the
stentorian voice declaring ``You've got mail'' _ have become our
masters. URGENT! they command. DROP EVERYTHING THIS VERY MINUTE!
 &HT;    So we do, because the scolds have made jittery compulsives of
us. We feel negligent, even guilty, if we don't interrupt what
we're doing to respond immediately. Then we check our e-mail, only
to find an ad telling us how we can get rid of unwanted e-mail.
 &HT;    Back before telephones and telegraphs, time and distance
precluded checking in for its own sake. In Jesus' time, it took 46
days to travel from Rome to Jerusalem. It took weeks for King
George III to hear about the Boston Tea Party, and weeks more to do
anything about it. The Pony Express, which still took 10 days to
bring mail from Missouri to California, charged $5 an ounce in
1860. Nobody used it just to say hi.
 &HT;    Communication was more deliberate and less trivial precisely
because time and distance demanded it. Now that we can reach out
and touch someone (and vice versa) in a millisecond, the teletoys
have distorted our sense not only of time and distance, but
importance. Because we have achieved instant communication, we
expect instant response, whether or not it's merited. The form and
content of the response scarcely matter. What we're after is not so
much communication as acknowledgment.
 &HT;    To not carry a cell phone or a pager, to not have voice mail, to
not be on line, is to all but declare yourself a hermit. The
concept of being out of touch, literally unreachable, no longer
exists. It's considered Luddite even to desire it. What do you
mean, I can't reach you?
 &HT;    The sad thing is, we've confused reaching with communicating.
All too often, we make the connection and realize we have nothing
worth saying. If so much of our checking in seems hurried,
perfunctory and shallow, it may be that we have no need, or desire,
to have a conversation in the first place.
 &HT;    Or perhaps we've lost the skills or don't grasp the form
anymore. The success of the film ``My Dinner With Andre'' was
considered remarkable _ who thought American audiences would sit
still for two characters (especially middle-age males) having an
expansive conversation over a meal? And that was in 1981, when
cable was still a novelty and the Internet an academic plaything.
 &HT;    The most notable thing about that conversation was that it was
face-to-face. It could not have happened over the Internet and
probably not by phone. The nuances, the natural rhythms and pauses,
the heads nodding and shaking, would have been lost.
 &HT;    The gadgets we invented to make conversation easier inhibit real
conversation by their very nature. Their speed encourages
superficiality because we can dial up or log on before we have
anything to say. Their portability allows us to check in while
we're doing something else _ driving a car, shopping for groceries,
watching a ballgame. So undivided attention has become an oxymoron.
 &HT;    Since we can reach people without reaching them, just by leaving
a detailed message after the tone, we don't need a conversation. In
fact, the whole idea can be not to have a conversation, but to
return the obligation to have one.
 &HT;    That's why so many business executives leave voice mails at 5:40
p.m. from their car phones, knowing that their intended recipient
has already left for the day. It's the checking-in version of
``Tag, you're it!''
 &HT;    Teletoys were designed to bring the remote into proximity (``Mr.
Watson, come here''). The truth is, they merely create the illusion
of proximity while keeping us at a distance. All we leave is a
scent _ a disembodied voice scratchy with tunnel static, a rambling
run-on paragraph on a cyberscreen, a pager number that seems
vaguely familiar.
 &HT;    We can leave that scent from the other side of the planet, where
today is already yesterday _ or not quite tomorrow. We don't feel
that we need to connect; time and space make that impractical
anyway. We check in, and we check out. The global village we talk
about is more of a global hotel.
 &HT;    Yet even if we do connect _ and sometimes we're caught
unprepared when we do, surprised that the person we're calling has
actually answered _ we're still at a remove. Our teletoys may erase
time and distance, but we remain remote, unseen. We miss all of the
visual cues that have always helped humans understand (and not
misunderstand) one another.
 &HT;    The Internet chat room is the epitome of checking in. We sit by
ourselves and log on to the world with a screen name. We send
cryptic messages to strangers we ``know'' because we've been on
line with them before, but who may not be anything like who they
say they are.
 &HT;    We all talk at once, and a computer chip decides who has
priority. We talk in lower-case fragments, in acronyms. We talk to
names who leave the room before we know they've clicked off and
checked in elsewhere. No matter. Somebody else will be checking in.
The chat room is always full.

   You must, this mother is here to tell you, keep up your
strength. I know, I know _ it's difficult in this heat. Drinking
eight glasses of water is no problem. Even slipping in a Gatorade
or two is a cinch. The problem comes at mealtime. Facing food in
this oppressive heat is no easy thing. Italian sounds too heavy.
Mexican is a must-have _ we are'' Texans _ but even that can be
ponderous. It's even too hot to dive in and out of the kitchen with
tongs to face the barbecue. We need easy food that is light on the
eyes, the stomach and kitchen time. Most of these salads are low on
cooking, high on taste _ and, just as important in this weather,
pleas'' ing to the eye, encouraging the diner to eat. If you'd like
to save even more time in the kitchen, buy grocery-store grilled
chicken. In any case, most of these salads have components that you
can cook on the one day you're willing to heat up your kitchen.
Dole out the cooked ingredients into salads as the week wears on.

beans (about 1 pound), rinsed and picked over 3 smoked ham hocks 2
(3-inch) cinnamon sticks 2 bay leaves 2 teaspoons ground cumin 2
tea'' spoons crushed hot red pepper 3/4 cup fresh lime juice 1/4
cup olive oil 8 cups torn spinach 4 large toma'' toes, cut into
1/2-inch dice 1 medium jicama (about 1 pound), peeled and cut into
1/2-inch dice (about 4 cups) 2/3 cup coarsely chopped cilantro or
parsley Salt and freshly ground pepper In large pot, soak beans in
cold water to cover by at least 2 inches for eight hours or
overnight. Drain; rinse out pot. In a large pot, combine black
beans, ham hocks, cinnamon sticks, bay leaves, cumin, hot pepper
and enough water to cover by 1 inch. Bring to a boil over high
heat. Reduce heat to low, cover and cook until tender but not
falling apart, about 1 hour. Remove from heat and let cool. Drain
mix'' ture. Pull meat from ham hocks and chop. Discard bones,
cinnamon sticks and bay leaves. In large bowl, blend lime juice and
olive oil. Add black beans, chopped meat, spin'' ach, tomatoes,
jicama and cilantro. Toss until well-blended. Season with salt and
pepper to taste. Serve at room temperature. Nutritional analysis

TWO CHILDREN DIE OF RARE AMOEBIC ILLNESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS VAUGHN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Physicians and public health authorities
have advised North Texans to avoid swimming in untreated fresh
water after the second child in less than a month died of a rare
and almost always fatal illness.
</P>
<P>
   Both boys died of amoebic encephalitis, a disease so rare that
theirs are the only cases recorded in the nation this year.
</P>
<P>
   The first victim was Chris Richardson, 9, of Randlett, Okla. He
died July 16 at Cook Children's Medical Center in Fort Worth after
swimming at Lake Arrowhead State Park near Wichita Falls. Aaron
Daniel Williams, 11, of Joshua died late Tuesday afternoon at Cook.
His death came about a week after he went swimming in a tributary
of the Brazos River.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk may be higher than usual because of the dry, drought
conditions, so we would like to encourage people to swim in
chlorinated water supplies,'' Dr. Alecia Hathaway of the Tarrant
County Health Authority said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hathaway and Dr. Donald Murphey, an infectious disease
specialist at Cook's, said the amoeba _ ``Naegleria fowleri'' _
usually grows in large numbers in warm, fresh water.
</P>
<P>
   Both physicians said the chances of contracting the disease are
extremely remote, but they urged parents to be overly cautious for
the rest of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Bacteria and amoebas multiply rapidly in stagnant water, such as
stock ponds or lake inlets. But Murphey said that he is especially
concerned because apparently neither child was swimming in stagnant
water.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my job to tell people about public health, but I am
concerned about anybody swimming in warm, fresh water,'' Murphey
said. ``It scares me because we've had two close together, when we
haven't had any in years.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts believe that the encephalitis is contracted when
amoeba-contaminated water is forced far up into a person's nose,
perhaps during diving, jumping or swimming underwater. The organism
enters the brain and begins causing life-threatening swelling and
seizures, Murphey said.
</P>
<P>
   The initial symptoms are fever, unusual sleepiness, vomiting,
irritability and a stiff neck. The symptoms usually begin two to
five days after swimming and seem to affect children and young
adults more, Murphey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids who may have been swimming in the last few weeks in
fresh water, we need to watch them for a week after to see if they
have problems like this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The symptoms resemble those of meningitis, which can usually be
treated successfully, Murphey said. Amoebic encephalitis is far
more dangerous, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have good drugs to treat it with,'' Murphey said.
``It's much more difficult to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   In the latest case, Aaron went swimming the last weekend in July
in a tributary of the Brazos River near Glen Rose, Murphey said.
Within a couple of days, he was sick and getting worse quickly. He
was taken to the Walls Regional Hospital in Cleburne and then
transferred to Cook's on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice if we could treat these kids early, but
really, the outcome of treating them is poor,'' Murphey said.
``Usually, treatment does not make much difference in how they do.
Really, what we need to concentrate on is prevention.''
</P>
<P>
   Health officials recommend people wear nose plugs when swimming
in fresh water.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Army Corps of Engineers, which operates
Benbrook, Grapevine, Lewisville and Joe Pool lakes, said that they
support the health department's caution, but that they have no
plans to close any swimming beaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without telling people to avoid the lakes altogether, it is a
good word of caution for people to avoid the shallow or still areas
of the lakes,'' Corps spokesman Ron Ruffennach said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Williams, a spokesman for the Tarrant Regional Water
District, which operates Eagle Mountain and Bridgeport lakes, said
he had not heard of the advisory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure we'll discuss it tomorrow morning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Burger's Lake, in far western Fort Worth, is chlorinated,
filtered and treated for bacteria in addition to having regular
Health Department tests, owner D.L. Black said.

PLAN TO BAN VEHICLES IN YOSEMITE IS OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The National Park Service has put the brakes on
its ambitious plan to ban almost all motor vehicles in the Yosemite
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Bowing to pressure from tourist-dependent communities
surrounding the park, the Yosemite Area Regional Transportation
Strategies agency decided Monday not to impose limits on motorized
vehicles in the popular national park in east-central California.
</P>
<P>
   Directors of the regional agency, created to address the
Yosemite Valley traffic congestion, voted 5-1 following a five-hour
hearing at Mammoth Lakes to rely on a voluntary busing program to
reduce summertime congestion.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1997, the Park Service rolled out a sales campaign
for its plan to reduce Yosemite traffic that would have had most
visitors arriving by bus, a technique that has been successful at
reducing vehicular traffic at some other busy parks and historic
sites.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ``gateway communities'' in the five California
counties that depend heavily on park tourism _ Tuolumne, Mono,
Madera, Merced and Mariposa _ objected and campaigned for a
less-drastic solution to a problem that occurs only during peak
summer days.
</P>
<P>
   Under the two-year pilot program adopted by the transportation
agency that will begin next June, a fleet of 16 buses will
transport visitors who prefer not to drive their cars. The bus
shuttles will run through Sept. 15, when the peak visitor season
begins to subside.
</P>
<P>
   Yosemite's chief planner, Chip Jenkins, voted for the project,
calling it ``a very positive step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The bus rides will not be free, however. The transit agency is
suggesting a charge of $3 per person or $6 per family to enter the
park by bus, plus a round-trip bus fare of $8 to $12. The current
park entry fee is $20 per car.

<P>
   You must, this mother is here to tell you, keep up your
strength.
</P>
<P>
   I know, I know _ it's difficult in this heat. Drinking eight
glasses of water is no problem. Even slipping in a Gatorade or two
is a cinch. The problem comes at mealtime.
</P>
<P>
   Facing food in this oppressive heat is no easy thing. Italian
sounds too heavy. Mexican is a must-have _ we ``are'' Texans _ but
even that can be ponderous. It's even too hot to dive in and out of
the kitchen with tongs to face the barbecue. We need easy food that
is light on the eyes, the stomach and kitchen time.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these salads are low on cooking, high on taste _ and,
just as important in this weather, pleasing to the eye, encouraging
the diner to eat. If you'd like to save even more time in the
kitchen, buy grocery-store grilled chicken. In any case, most of
these salads have components that you can cook on the one day
you're willing to heat up your kitchen. Dole out the cooked
ingredients into salads as the week wears on.

   JEKYLL AND HYDE BLACK BEAN SALAD

</P>
<P>
   3 smoked ham hocks
</P>
<P>
   2 (3-inch) cinnamon sticks
</P>
<P>
   2 bay leaves
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons ground cumin
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons crushed hot red pepper
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup fresh lime juice
</P>

   1/4 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   8 cups torn spinach
</P>

<P>
   1 medium jicama (about 1 pound), peeled and cut into 1/2-inch
dice (about 4 cups)
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup coarsely chopped cilantro or parsley
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   In large pot, soak beans in cold water to cover by at least 2
inches for eight hours or overnight. Drain; rinse out pot.
</P>
<P>
   In a large pot, combine black beans, ham hocks, cinnamon sticks,
bay leaves, cumin, hot pepper and enough water to cover by 1 inch.
Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low, cover and cook
until tender but not falling apart, about 1 hour. Remove from heat
and let cool. Drain mixture. Pull meat from ham hocks and chop.
Discard bones, cinnamon sticks and bay leaves.
</P>
<P>
   In large bowl, blend lime juice and olive oil. Add black beans,
chopped meat, spinach, tomatoes, jicama and cilantro. Toss until
well-blended. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve at room
temperature.

already in widespread manufacturing and commercial use. But what
about personal robots? If the dreams of some robot developers come
true, recent advances in computer science, artificial intelligence
and engineering, coupled with a growing consumer acceptance of
electronic gizmos, may soon converge to create a personal robotics
industry. By Peter H. Lewis.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    PARIS _ Despite vague expressions of interest in improving
relations, a Paris encounter between an American and an Iranian
last week showed there is still a very long way to go, and a very
different view on each side of the history that led to rupture and
hostility between the two countries.
 &HT;    The American, Barry Rosen, had been held as a hostage in the
U.S. Embassy in Teheran for 444 days, which he remembered with
obviously great distress. The Iranian, Abbas Abdi, was one of the
students who directed the seizure of the Embassy in 1979. They had
not met since, and they managed to shake hands after a couple of
hours of public debate, although Abdi refused to express any
regrets for the forced imprisonment saying ``our whole nation was
held hostage for 25 years.''
 &HT;    The meeting was arranged by the Cyprus-based organization Center
for World Dialogue, one of the many non-governmental groups
springing up around the world with the aim of finding ways to
enable people to talk out their grievances when their governments
can't. It revealed, in a subtle way, what must be a raging argument
in Iran about opening up the country and making up with the United
States.
 &HT;    Although he castigated the media for failing to report what was
going on his country before the revolution, Abdi refused to say
anything about what is happening now. He wouldn't even say why he
was imprisoned for eight months in 1993 and since 1996 has been
banned from publishing or editing the newspaper with which he is
still associated. But he listed both punishments at the end of a
long resume otherwise full of his exploits on behalf of the
Khomeini revolution.
 &HT;    Evidently, the pressures for relaxation have not gone far enough
to make it safe to talk about them publicly abroad. But he did
come, and _ an ironic detail _ he was the only member of the
three-man panel who did not sport a traditional Islamic beard. The
American panelist and the French mediator both did.
 &HT;    The exchange showed how much each side still misconstrued the
history of their confrontation. Abdi said the students who invaded
the Embassy thought they would keep the hostages for a week at most
_ and that they would find support among that part of the American
population which had forced the United States out of Vietnam.
 &HT;    It is clear that the prime motive for the seizure was not to
challenge the United States but to force the resignation of the
Iranian premier and foreign minister who, the Khomeini
revolutionaries feared, might make a deal with the United States to
overthrow them. The mullahs had gained considerable power through
the Mossadegh revolution in 1951, but they were ousted by a
U.S.-backed coup which restored the Shah's power in 1953. The
memory still burns. Abdi said if relations were resumed with the
United States, it should be on the ``pre-1953 basis.''
 &HT;    Just before the hostages were taken, the then U.S. National
Security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski had met the Iranian premier
and foreign minister at a big anniversary celebration in Algiers.
He told them, and repeated publicly, that the ``U.S. has nothing
against religion and Iran'' so they could get along. But as soon as
the Iranian officials returned, the Embassy crisis led to their
overthrow.
 &HT;    But the United States took it as a direct assault. President
Jimmy Carter said he would not go out of the White House Rose
Garden to campaign until he had secured the hostages' release.
Americans everywhere displayed yellow ribbons to show their
sympathy with the captured diplomats. The Teheran students
discovered to their surprise that they had a much bigger political
weapon than they had imagined, so they clung to it.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, Iraq's invasion of Iran mobilized national feeling
and helped the Khomeini regime to consolidate. Iranians claim that
the United States aided Iraq, which was not the case until late in
the eight-year war when Iran seemed on the way to victory. There is
every reason to believe that the push for modernization and
moderation now delicately but visibly stirring in Iran would have
begun a decade earlier but for Saddam Hussein's attack.
 &HT;    It is clearly a push from below, particularly from the young in
support of President Mohammed Khatemi who first suggested starting
cultural exchanges to warm up relations with the United States. But
Abdi, who obviously agrees, showed by his reticence that too warm a
response by Americans might hurt more than help his cause in the
conflict with hard-line fundamentalists.
 &HT;    It is time for the United States and Iran to find a way to
reconciliation. But grave past misreading of each other's
intentions and expectations remain a barrier, and the cloudy
situation in Iran makes assumptions of how best to go about it
unwise at this point. Good will isn't enough when historic wounds
still ache. Ignorance is a serious handicap.

   ZANESVILLE-POTTERY (Zanesville, Ohio) _ To the unschooled
traveler, Zanesville, Ohio is the middle of nowhere _ best known
for having the country's biggest ``Y'' bridge _ but for anyone with
a passion for American pottery, it's the center of the universe.
This small Muskingum County town, population 26,000, is the
birthplace of Zane Grey, Agnes Moorehead and a major portion of the
pottery made in the United States in the last 150 years. By

 &HT;    Tequila: The new hip sip
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock and Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   An American woman vacationing in Mexico was having a Christmas
party. She wanted to make a special drink. So she took her favorite
orange-flavored liqueur, mixed it with tequila and lime juice,
spread a little salt on the rim of a glass and _ caramba! _ a new
cocktail was born. The party ended up lasting two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   That popular account of the invention of the margarita may not
be true, but it's a great story. And it shows how Americans got
hooked on tequila without ever knowing what it tasted like. Once
Jimmy Buffett convinced us that it was perfectly fine to get
plastered and crawl around searching for our ``lost shaker of
salt'' (and who knows what else), there was no turning back.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's hope. We'd say it's just a sign of the limes, or the
dawning of the Age of Agave. But then you'd think we got carried
away with the research. So, um. ...
</P>
<P>
   The point _ and we do have one _ is that premium tequilas, like
single-malt scotches and single-barrel bourbons, are becoming a
drink of choice among the cocktail cognoscenti. In bars,
restaurants and liquor stores all over town, discerning drinkers
are choosing 100 percent blue agave tequilas over the cheaper
types, which are fermented with non-agave sugars. And they are
learning to sip from shot glasses or snifters in authentic Mexican
fashion _ neat.
</P>
<P>
   Those who've ventured to Mexico probably know about sangrita,
the orange-and-tomato-based chaser that's served in a little glass
on the side, with dishes of lime and coarse salt. But true tequila
apasionados will have none of that. They quaff it like wine,
rhapsodizing about oaken undertones and apple aromas, whispers of
apricot, pear and melon, the tingle of pepper and anise. They
describe finishes as astringent as vodka _ or as voluptuously
rounded as a fine brandy or cognac.
</P>
<P>
   Tequila is a sexy ingredient in the kitchen, too. It gives verve
to vinaigrettes and marinades, pizazz to shrimp cocktails and
gazpachos. It marries beautifully with honey, brown sugar, lime,
chiles and cilantro, any of which may be blended and brushed onto
seafood, meat, fruits or vegetables on the grill. And it gives
cheesecakes, flans and sorbets a little wink. ``It seems like
everyone is talking about tequila,'' says Andy Klubock, owner of
Taco Mac on Roswell Road, which stocks some 52 kinds of tequila. In
the July-August issue of Spirits &AMP; Cocktails magazine, the hot-wing
joint was ranked 14th among the nation's top 20 tequila bars. This
fall, it will take things up another notch: Klubock is opening a
location in the Cumming area that will shelve 150 kinds.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are being adventurous,'' says Brooke Vosika, chef at
the Four Seasons Hotel in Midtown. ``You've got the single-malt
scotch crowd and the wine crowd. Tequila is just an extension of
this trend.'' On Monday, the hotel bar will roll out a top-drawer
assortment of about 20 tequilas, including the $50-a-shot Herradura
Seleccion Suprema.
</P>
<P>
   Vosika says the new, more complex tequilas are also pushing
chefs to revise their usual tequila snacks. ``You don't want to use
hot peppers with the white tequilas, because it will overwhelm
them,'' Vosika advises. With white tequilas, he likes to serve a
dip of goat cheese and grits, instead of red-hot salsa. But the
older, darker tequilas can hold their own with stronger flavors
such as stuffed jalapeno peppers and spicy beef tenderloin, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   David Halliday, general manager of Tower Package Store on
Piedmont Road in Atlanta, said folks are buying premium tequilas to
enjoy at home, too. ``My tequila selection has probably doubled in
the last year,'' he says. ``Right now, I compare them to the craft
beers and microbrews of four to five years ago. There's a lot of
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Halliday's store carries dozens of tequila varieties, ranging
from $7 to $75. He says some customers seem as attracted to the
novelty bottles as to the spirits. One brand comes with a cactus
inside; another bottle is shaped like a worm. (That grub, though,
signifies cheap mescal, which is made from a different type of
agave.)
</P>
<P>
   The best way to figure out what you like is to sip around. To
sample blue agave in its purest state, try blanco or plata
(``white'' or ``silver''), which is clear in color and aged no more
than 60 days. Reposado, whose lovely moniker means ``reposed'' or
``rested,'' is the color of pale straw and is aged at least 60
days. The finest of all, anejo (``aged''), is sealed in oak barrels
for at least a year and comes in shades of gold and amber. But
beyond a certain point, aging destroys tequila's subtleties, unlike
whisky or scotch.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you aren't enamored of the straight stuff, there's
always the classic 'rita. Purists will want to unplug the blender
and dig out the cocktail shaker. At Nava, a chichi
Southwestern-themed restaurant in Buckhead, manager Brian Harrison
says, ``We don't offer a frozen margarita. ... A great margarita is
made to order.''
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, an older woman in a well-tailored navy suit
showed up on NBC's ``Today'' show. She was Margaret Sames, alleged
inventor of that first margarita (``Margarita'' is Spanish for
``Margaret''). In a whisky-and-cigarette voice, she insisted that
the secret ingredient is Cointreau _ and nothing else except
tequila.
</P>
<P>
   ``But don't some people use triple sec?'' asked host Bryant
Gumbel.
</P>
<P>
   If they do, she snorted, ``They have just a sweet, disgusting
drink.''
</P>
<P>
   We'll sip to that.

 &HT;    Tasty tequila recipes
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker and Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ccording to a folk legend, tequila was discovered in Mexico's
pre-Hispanic times when a bolt of lightning struck an agave plant,
burning the heart for several seconds, causing the plant not only
to cook, but to ferment. The shocked natives noticed an aromatic
nectar coming out of the plant and partook, with a certain amount
of fear and reverence.
</P>
<P>
   For many of us today, when we hear the word ``tequila,'' we
think ``burn'' or ``hangover'' with our own amount of fear and
reverence. But hardly ever do we think of flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Kretchmer, owner of Mesa Grill and Mesa City
restaurants in New York, wants us to change the way we think. In
his new book, ``Mesa Grill Guide to Tequila'' (Black Dog and
Leventhal, $9.98), he describes it as ``probably the most
underappreciated and misunderstood of the world's great spirits.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only is tequila _ particularly the emerging premium brands _
worth sipping, it is also worth sopping. Try some of these recipes
that incorporate tequila in creative ways. Use the brand you like
(and can afford) in these recipes. And don't be afraid to add a
splash to some of your favorites, especially for salsas, sorbets
and salad dressings.

<P>
   This works every time. Of course you may vary proportions to
taste. You may also substitute Grand Marnier for the Cointreau, for
the drink that's popularly known as the Texas Margarita.
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   2ounces tequila
</P>
<P>
   1ounce Cointreau
</P>
<P>
   Juice of one lime (or about 1 ounce)
</P>
<P>
   Crushed ice
</P>
<P>
   Juice the lime and set aside juice. Moisten the side of a glass
with leftover lime rind. Put some salt in a saucer; roll the glass
around in it and set aside. Put tequila, Cointreau and lime juice
in a cocktail shaker with lots of crushed ice. Shake until the
shaker is so cold it freezes your hand. Then strain drink into the
glass. Add ice if you like.

<P>
   Preparation time: 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we know. You love margaritas. But if you are going for
authentic, try tequila with this spicy chaser _ the preferred
cocktail in Mexico. And please, make it rather than buy it. Several
bartenders around town told us they don't offer the drink because
they can't find a commercial sangrita that comes close to the real
thing.
</P>
<P>
   2pounds very juicy tomatoes, peeled and seeded (about 6
tomatoes)
</P>
<P>
   1cup orange juice
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup lime juice
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup chopped white onion
</P>
<P>
   1teaspoon granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   About 1/4 teaspoon sea salt
</P>
<P>
   3to 4 fresh serrano chiles, seeded and chopped, or 1/2 to 1
teaspoon ground pequin, tepin or cayenne
</P>
<P>
   Lime wedges
</P>
<P>
   Place the tomatoes, orange juice, lime juice, onion, sugar, sea
salt in a blender or food processor and blend. Add the chiles or
ground pepper in small amounts, tasting as you go. Blend until
quite smooth and as spicy as you like. It may have to be done in
several batches. Put the sangrita in a jar or other container,
cover and chill for at least 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   When you are ready for your tequila drinking to begin, pour the
sangrita into very small glasses, each holding 2 to 3 ounces, and
serve with a good-quality tequila poured into other small glasses
similar to shot glasses. Take a sip of the tequila, then sangrita,
with an occasional suck on a lime wedge between sips. _ From

   Here's a quick way to liven up pinto beans. The tequila infuses
but doesn't overwhelm, and the chiles add bite. Great with rice and
soft tacos.

<P>
   In a saucepan heat oil over medium-high heat. Saute onions and

</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 300 degrees. Grease an 8-inch cake pan or

</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl, combine pumpkin seeds, graham cracker crumbs, 2
tablespoons sugar and melted butter; blend well. Pat the mixture
evenly over the bottom of the prepared pan.
</P>
<P>
   In a mixing bowl, place the cream cheese, room-temperature
butter, 1 cup sugar and cornstarch and beat at medium speed just to
blend. Add the eggs one at a time until each is incorporated.
Reduce the mixing speed and beat in the sour cream, 1/4 cup tequila
and vanilla.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the batter onto the graham cracker crust. Set the pan in a
larger pan such as a roasting pan and pour about 1 inch of hot
water into the larger pan. (If using a springform pan, wrap the
bottom with aluminum foil.) Bake for 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours, or until
lightly tanned, slightly puffed and barely firm. Cool to room
temperature in the water bath. Remove from larger pan, refrigerate
several hours or overnight and remove from cake or springform pan.
</P>
<P>
   For the glaze: Place lime marmalade, lime juice, 1 tablespoon
tequila and water in a small saucepan and cook over medium heat
until smooth, stirring constantly. Let cool 5 minutes and pour over
the top of the cheesecake. _ From ``The Mesa Grill Guide to

<P>
   Long depicted as the province of science fiction fans and mad
scientists, robots are moving _ rolling, walking, crawling, flying,
wriggling, hopping and creeping, to be precise _ into everyday
life.
</P>
<P>
   Specialized mechanical robots are already in widespread use in
manufacturing, medicine, law enforcement, exploration and other
commercial applications. But what about personal robots?
</P>
<P>
   Only a couple of decades ago, the idea of personal computers
seemed strange, yet today they are a multibillion-dollar industry.
If the dreams of some robot developers come true, recent advances
in computer science, artificial intelligence and engineering,
coupled with a growing consumer acceptance of electronic gizmos,
may soon converge to create a personal robotics industry.
</P>
<P>
   Academic researchers, hobbyists and a few businesses are already
thinking about the potential for veritable menageries of personal
robots that can perform one or more domestic tasks, like mowing the
lawn, vacuuming the floor, watering plants, serving drinks,
delivering mail, feeding the pets, watching the house while the
owner is on vacation (did you remember to unplug the coffeepot?)
and helping disabled people do simple chores.
</P>
<P>
   At least one researcher envisions armies of cheap, simple
microrobots that will scurry out from under the sofa at night,
devouring dust and bugs, washing the floor, cleaning the windows
and probably scaring the cat half to death _ unless, of course, the
cat is also a robot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like where computers were 20 years ago,'' said
Gregory Dudek, an assistant professor of computer science at McGill
University in Montreal. ``Today's robots are weird, kludgy things.
But then, 20 years ago people bought computers that were also
awkward to use. That's the sort of change we're looking for in the
robot industry. I don't think it will happen in the next two years,
but in the next 5 or 10 years, certainly.''
</P>
<P>
   Who would not want a personal robot?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this wonderful thing about having something do what
you tell it to do and act as if it were alive,'' said David P.
Miller, technical director at the KISS Institute for Practical
Robotics, an educational organization in Reston, Va. ``We often ask
kids to draw pictures of the robots they'd like to have, and they
usually describe one that will clean their room, beat up their
little brother _ you know, some task you would want a big servant
to take care of.''
</P>
<P>
   But instead of the hulking, mechanical tin cans that did the
bidding of their mad scientist masters in yesterday's science
fiction movies, tomorrow's personal robots are likely to be much
smaller and look less like humans.
</P>
<P>
   With whirring motors, flashing lights and occasional beeps,
small mobile robots are beginning to show up in schools, toy
stores, gift catalogs and even a growing number of robot specialty
shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business has tripled in the last two years,'' said Mary
Neitzel, manager of Mondo-tronics, a robotics company based in San
Rafael, Calif. The company, which has a Web site at
www.robotstore.com, also sponsors a series of popular robot
exhibitions on the West Coast. It used to sell expensive items like
a solar-powered robot lawn mower _ the first order came from
Lichtenstein, of all places _ but now Mondo-tronics sells only
robot construction kits.
</P>
<P>
   While some might prefer to buy a working Little Brother
Beater-Upper unit right out of the box, most of the action in
consumer robots right now is in kits.
</P>
<P>
   Lego Anthony Fudd, 26, an architecture and mechanical
engineering student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
has what some people might see as an ideal job, spending his days
building toys from Lego blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Best known for filling the world with nearly 200 billion little
plastic blocks that hurt like heck when a parent is walking
barefoot around the house, Lego has been working with researchers
at MIT for nearly a decade to create computer-controlled toys.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first commercial results of such research is the Lego
Mindstorms Robotics Invention System , which is to go on sale in
North America about Sept. 1 (www.legomindstorms.com). The kit takes
relatively sophisticated robotics technology and puts it into the
hands of children (or, to be precise, children 12 and older who can
persuade their parents to hand over $200 for a combination of light
and touch sensors and motors, more than 700 Lego pieces,
Windows-based software and a small, infrared-controlled computer
built as an oversize Lego block.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who has ever played with toys and models has wanted
the toys to play with them,'' Fudd said. ``And now, with the
Robotics Invention System, you can.''
</P>
<P>
   The brain of the system is made up of the battery-powered
computer, called the RCX unit, and the software. Users with no
programming experience can assemble prefabricated modules of
software on a computer in much the same way as they would snap
together a model with plastic blocks.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting programs are then beamed to the RCX computer block
by an infrared signal, and the smaller computer puts the child's
inventions into action.
</P>
<P>
   A construction manual in the kit gives detailed plans for
several experiments, including one called Refrigerator Fred with a
robot that answers the cosmic question, ``Does the little light in
the refrigerator stay on when the door is closed?'' Using light
sensors that cause a pair of plastic sunglasses to either hide or
reveal his eyes, Fred provides the answer. A slight modification
yields a robot that can warn you if a little brother sneaks into
your room without permission.
</P>
<P>
   Other robot constructions can be as elaborate or as simple as
the user desires. Fudd, for example, built a Lego robot to sort his
pocket change and another to turn on a light in his apartment when
it gets dark. Additional modules will be sold that enable users to
create wild animals, sports robots and a replica of the Mars rover.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the basic idea of giving children the power to put their
ideas into motion,'' he said. ``And, of course, it's a lot of
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sony Corp. thinks that robots have entertainment value. Sony
has been demonstrating a robotic dog, sort of a Robocop Meets the
Taco Bell Chihuahua contraption, that it hopes will become the next
fad in consumer electronics. The Sony robot dog walks (albeit
slowly), wags its tail, fetches a ball and responds to hand
gestures for ``stay,'' ``sit'' and other doggy commands.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks much smarter than it really is,'' Miller of the KISS
Institute said after playing with a prototype. ``It looks like it
was made primarily out of Sony camcorder components.'' Sony
officials said a robotic dog could be ready for market by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of robotic pets has undeniable attraction to many
people. Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology are
developing a small mobile robot called Pepe (the word is a
shortened form of Personal Pet) that its creators hope will someday
be perceived as more of a friend or companion than as a robot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to develop robots that can interact with people
in a natural manner,'' said Ashwin Ram, an associate professor in
the Intelligent Systems Group of the College of Computing at
Georgia Tech. ``If you're going to plunk one of these robots down
in someone's house, you want to interact with it naturally, with
speech and gestures, the same sort of way you would interact with
real pets. You don't want to have to have a PhD to use a robot.''
</P>
<P>
   The current version of Pepe looks ``like a Tonka truck,'' Ram
said, but it could eventually take the form of a lifelike, plush
toy. The appearance is trivial compared with the robot's
intelligence and personality, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to enable the robot to pick up the user's speech
and gestures, but also to be able to understand the user's
intentions, emotional state, needs and goals,'' Ram said. ``It
should figure out when you're tired, happy or playful, or when you
don't want to be bothered. You don't want to have it interrupt you
and start vacuuming or mowing the lawn when you're unhappy or
tired.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the more unusual robot prototypes on display last week at
the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Madison,
Wisc., was a robot plant, attached to a PC, that blooms, droops and
makes little alien noises depending on a text analysis of the
owner's incoming e-mail messages. The robot plant, whose official
name is Office Plant No. 1, the Kind With Leaves and Roots, was
developed by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University who envision
a class of ``intimate technology'' robots that are more attuned to
environments than to specific tasks.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there is something appealing about having a
robot servant.
</P>
<P>
   In an annual hors d'oeuvres competition at the artificial
intelligence conference last week, mobile robots roamed at a
cocktail party, using combinations of sonar, computer vision,
speech synthesis and other sensing technologies to serve snacks to
the humans.
</P>
<P>
   One hazard, from the robots' point of view, is that curious
humans often crowd around them, making navigation difficult. Each
year at this competition, some humans try to confuse the robots by
repeatedly stepping into their paths (prompting the robots to use
synthesized speech to ask them to move), by covering their vision
sensors with hands or, in one egregious example of sabotage, by
poking peanuts into a robot's sensors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the kind of thing that if you'd done it to a real waiter,
someone would have been punched,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Outlandish? Not to anyone who has visited the Yo! Sushi
restaurant in London, where some robots make food and others wander
the floor serving drinks, growling at customers to get out of their
way and muttering robot aphorisms like ``life is a never-ending
circuit.''
</P>
<P>
   Risto Miikkulainen, an associate professor of computer sciences
at the University of Texas at Austin, said of the sushi bots, ``It
was the first time I've run across a robot like this in the real
world, not in a demonstration.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the potential for robot servants in the home,
Miikkulainen, an expert in neural networks and cognition, was
circumspect. ``It seems to me that there is a real shift going
on,'' he said. ``Robots used to be used for extremely close
alignments on the factory floor, where everything is controlled.
The trend now is to make them more open-ended and adaptive.''
</P>
<P>
   The home will be the true test of machine adaptation, as humans
rearrange furniture, toss shoes and dirty clothes on the floor, set
stereo systems blaring and turn lights on and off. But while such
environments would be hell for today's robots, tomorrow will be
another story, scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hans Moravec, principal research scientist at the Robotics
Institute at Carnegie Mellon, recently wrote a business prospectus
outlining the development of ``autonomous free-ranging utility
robots for the mass market before 2005.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Moravec said, autonomous robots _ those capable
of navigating without direct human control _ had the functional
intelligence of insects. ``Today the actual level of intelligence
of computers is just starting to touch the lower vertebrate
levels,'' he said. ``As soon as 2010, we could have general-purpose
robots comparable in intelligence to lizards. Then there could be
mouselike intelligence, with learning and adaptation, by 2020, and
monkeylike intelligence by 2030.''
</P>
<P>
   At that stage, Moravec said, ``you could be talking to the
household robot and you would think that it is conscious.''
</P>
<P>
   By 2040, the fourth-generation household robot could add a layer
of reasoning and become humanlike, Moravec said. ``After that, we
humans are obsolete,'' he said with a chuckle.

 By LOUISE G. YARNALL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OJAI, Calif. _ David Harris, a high-school physics teacher, was
proudly presenting his show stopper, high-technology tuning forks,
when a bit of technological skepticism from the audience threatened
to break the spell.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, a towering Englishman with a mop of brown hair who wears
his tie askew, struck two tuning forks and then directed his
audience to watch a large screen on the wall. There, the thrumming
notes were transformed into a live animation of interweaving sound
waves by a handheld computer and a projector's beam, a real-time
presentation of physics in action.
</P>
<P>
   The audience _ science and mathematics teachers participating in
the W.M. Keck Summer Technology Institute _ responded with oohs,
aahs and wows. Then a hand shot up. ``So, David, are you saying
this is really better than a Slinky?'' asked Geraldine Lamar, a
middle-school science teacher from Oxnard, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Harris' presentation, and Ms. Lamar's question, are typical of
those popping up this season in sessions that have become a rite of
summer for a growing number of teachers. As American schools
approach the 20-year mark of a spending spree on educational
technology, more teachers are spending their summer days cramming
on technology.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 80 percent of American schools had Internet access by
last year, according to the United States Department of Education,
and about a quarter of those schools had access directly in the
classroom. But as the novelty of computers has worn off, the demand
to use them for high-quality learning has increased.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of costly computers gathering dust in school storerooms
or being used as overpriced typewriters have contributed to a
rising backlash against computer spending by schools. Critics
question the expense of computers, particularly when schools buy
them with money diverted from programs for the arts, textbooks and
extracurricular activities.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lamar's inexpensive and beloved Slinky, used to demonstrate
the same physics principle, could show one type of sound wave, but
not the one created by two distinct sounds, Harris told her. Only a
$30 microphone, a $150 Vernier interface, an $80 Texas Instruments
83 calculatorand a $200 liquid crystal display panel could do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't do that with a Slinky,'' Harris said. ``I can't
think of another way of showing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer eased Ms. Lamar's concerns over the $8,000 her school
had just spent on such equipment. ``If we could just do this with a
Slinky, yes, we would, but we can't teach everything with a
Slinky,'' Ms. Lamar said later.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important question is, `How's this going to help my
students learn better?''' said Marjorie DeWert, an assistant
professor of educational psychology at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill. ``If you don't answer that one, you're
dead in the water.'' She is co-founder of a premier teacher
technology workshop, the SCOUT (Students Constructing their Own
Understanding with Technology) Camp.
</P>
<P>
   Even with computers pouring into classrooms, most of the
nation's education schools use the traditional training courses and
treat technology as a frill. This means that both new and
experienced teachers find themselves trying to catch up during the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young teachers are coming in with more personal proficiency,
but they still need the `how do I use them in my classroom' part,''
said Carol Gilkinson, a third-grade teacher at Charter Oak School
District in Glendora, Calif., and an adviser to the California
Teacher Credentialing Commission. ``The university doesn't always
provide that.''
</P>
<P>
   Research has shown that computers must become more than a door
prize for good behavior in class and more like a genuine
alternative to ``chalk and talk,'' as Harris calls it.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, summer computer workshops focused on pushing
buttons.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1981, we were teaching the computer,'' said Jim Shaver, an
administrator for the Kings County Office of Education in
California. ``Now there's a greater emphasis on teaching the
subject matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The old approach limited the educational effect of computers in
schools. Most teachers returned to classrooms only to find they had
endless technical problems or, worse, that they needed an expensive
upgrade to make their new software work. Many found the process of
managing 20 to 30 students clamoring for computer time too
overwhelming. Or they waited months for schools to approve their
plans and to get supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Now summer workshops touch on learning theories. ``The focus is
on having children play a more active role in constructing their
knowledge,'' said Nancy Vye, director of the Learning Technology
Center at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. ``The teacher's role
changes as well, from one of being a lecturer and disseminator of
facts to one in which he or she is more focused on setting up
inquiry environments for students.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginger Hovenic of the Classroom of the Future Foundation in San
Diego, said one benefit of the hands-on learning approach was that
it built teacher confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought they had to be techies and that it was going to
take away from instruction with the kids,'' Dr. Hovenic said. After
the session, ``more and more teachers say, `I can do this.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Teachers still face many challenges when they return to school.
Ms. Lamar, the skeptical science teacher, said that the workshop
``provides a vision'' but that it did not help with the everyday
problems, like preventing theft, scheduling computer resources
among thousands of students and training in technology.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lamar is one of the lucky ones. She will return to a school
that recently won a three-year, $75,000 grant to bring all teachers
up to speed on the technology. Even so, her work is cut out for
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on such a steep learning curve because we're learning
this brand new technology,'' she said. ``And many of the teachers,
especially those without background in this area, are not only
learning the new technology but the concepts that they'll be using
to teach.''
</P>
<P>
   To help teachers once they return to their classrooms,
researchers are developing online support communities.
</P>
<P>
   Tapped In, an online community being developed by Mark Schlager,
a researcher at SRI International in Menlo Park, Calif., opened
about seven months ago. About 1,000 members of Tapped In now browse
the site regularly, including about 300 teachers from elementary
and secondary schools around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Members can advertise summer workshops and set up Web sites and
discussion groups. Schlager said opportunities to chat included
``three-minute snippets at the virtual water cooler.''
</P>
<P>
   At the University of California at Berkeley, James Slotta, a
researcher, is developing an online community with a more specific
focus, one that supports a group of teachers using science software
developed by his mentor, Professor Marcia Linn.
</P>
<P>
   The software, called Knowledge Integration Environment or
Web-based Integrated Science Environment, engages middle-school
students in Web-based explorations and debates about scientific
data and evidence. Slotta's Web site currently features a debate
about what is causing deformities in frogs.
</P>
<P>
   Summer workshops can last anywhere from a day to a couple of
weeks. The most elaborate resemble summer camps.
</P>
<P>
   In one room at the Ojai session, teachers were sketching out
shapes with Geometer's Sketchpad by stretching points on the screen
into polygons with a few mouse clicks, just as students can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they draw their own circumferences by hand, they don't
get pi,'' said Vicki Vierra, a middle-school science and
mathematics teacher from Oxnard, Calif., who is familiar with
Geometer's Sketchpad. ``Here, it measures it perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   Another group in Ojai was learning to use Dataslate, mapping
software that presents satellite imagery of the world going back to
1938. The instructor, Roger Kassebaum, a science instructor from
Omaha, showed teachers how to map the ruts of the Oregon Trail and
explore the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think just using imagery in a classroom is a nice change of
pace from all the talk we do in classrooms,'' Kassebaum said.
</P>
<P>
   The pace at summer technology workshops tends to be quick. ``You
should learn to do the fly-by's by tomorrow morning,'' Kassebaum
said. ``And then to the QuickTime Virtual Reality.'' In other
classrooms, teachers were learning how to create World Wide Web
pages and how to link to online databases for Web-based lesson
plans.
</P>
<P>
   The summer computer workshop tends to appeal to teachers who get
bored by routine. For some veteran cyberteachers, summer becomes a
smorgasbord of workshops, institutes and seminars. Dennis O'Dea, a
high school instructor from Oxnard, Calif., was planning to attend
three technology workshops this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way you can keep up in this business is through
training,'' O'Dea said ``It sure keeps you from getting burned out.
I enjoy seeing the kids get excited about it. And it's a skill that
I think is going to help them in higher education and industry.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some teachers take the summer workshops simply to
pile up a few more credits so they move up the pay scale. But many
teachers do much more than that.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Mendes, an eighth-grade teacher in Lamoore, Calif., did
not know how to turn on a computer 16 years ago but recently
presented to dozens of other teachers an Internet-based mathematics
lesson that she designed with Bruce Hills, a fellow teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Her lesson, which is available on the Internet
(www.kings.k12.ca.us/math/lessons/firstcar.htm), grew out of a
summer workshop that she and Hills took a few years back. In that
workshop, they searched the Internet for deals on a new pickup
truck. That experience turned into a mathematics lesson in which
students compared costs on the Internet for three cars, examining
prices and maintenance and insurance costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really made it come alive,'' Mrs. Mendes said. ``They could
see the actual car they were going to purchase. Right now, if you
can find it on the computer, you can pique their interest.''

<P>
   WILTON, N.Y. _ Harolyn Lawton's 54 years as a Navy pinup girl
began as a joke entry in a contest. But it won the hearts of the
men aboard the USS New Jersey in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The battleship held a contest for people to submit nominations
to be the ship's official pinup. One entrant was Harolyn, who at
the time was 5 months old.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother heard about the contest. She sent it in just
for a joke,'' said Lawton, now 54.
</P>
<P>
   The 74 other entrants to be the battleship's sweetheart were
leggy young women. None came close to challenging the cherubic
photo of the smiling Harolyn on a flowered satin blanket.
</P>
<P>
   Lawton, then Harolyn Meyer and living in Newark, N.J., received
555 votes out of 1,376 cast. Her closest grown-up competitor was
overwhelmed, losing by a 4-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real solid statement by the guys,'' Lawton said.
``They said the baby reminded them of home. This was a much tighter
tie to home than a 17- or 18-year-old high school girl.''
</P>
<P>
   The battleship is back in the news as it prepares to leave
Washington state for its new home in New Jersey, where it will be a
floating museum.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Collins, a machinist second-class aboard the New Jersey,
recalls 1943 contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were all sorts of pictures there. Everybody wanted his
own sweetheart as a pinup girl,'' said Collins, 73, a native of
Camden, N.J., who now lives in nearby Palmyra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go for the baby. Everybody voted for her,'' Collins said
in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   A letter from two sailors, signed simply Russo and Kristich,
arrived at Harolyn's home in late 1943. She has preserved it among
the newspaper clippings and officials photos from her pinup years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever sent your picture might be playing a joke on your
part, but you tell Mama, you are our baby pinup,'' the two sailors
wrote on the thin paper reserved for wartime correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the boys admire you every day, it brings back to them their
loved ones they left behind. You are the greatest, littlest morale
builder that ever hit our eyes,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   At age 3, Lawton inspected the ranks of the 3,000 crew members
aboard the New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The wartime crew had a major impact on her life. It was a $3,200
savings bond that they purchased for Lawton that permitted her to
attend college. Without the money, she wouldn't have been able to
afford college.
</P>
<P>
   Lawton's early connection to the World War II warship surfaced
recently as battleship enthusiasts from both coasts fought over
where the ship should be docked. New Jersey won and the ship is
returning home from Bremerton, Wash., where it had been mothballed.
</P>
<P>
   But several cities in New Jersey are still competing for the
ship. The choices are Camden, across from the Philadelphia Navy
Yard where Lawton's photo was displayed with all the other
contestants 54 years ago, and Bayonne or Jersey City.
</P>
<P>
   Collins is clear on his choice. ``Right here in Camden we've got
the berth all ready,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawton takes a more diplomatic approach. She wants it in New
Jersey, but at a site the public can easily visit.

THE WEB'S STEPPING STONES TO A FAMILY'S HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 (jt)  
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, my parents opened a black cloth suitcase that
belonged to my grandparents and found an unfamiliar photograph of
seven young women and girls in long white dresses, posing in a
faraway meadow. ``They might be sisters,'' my mother said,
describing the photograph to me over the phone. ``In the distance,
I can see a village, I think. Oh, and wait. Printed across one of
the girls' pinafores, in very faint pencil, it says, `Alice.'''
</P>
<P>
   That is all my family has left of Poland, where the photo was
taken, and of Alice, who had my grandmother's nose. Was she
someone's favorite aunt, singled out for identification because she
was the sister who laughed the most? Did she die young? Or did she
make it to the United States on one of the boats that brought the
rest of my father's relatives _ the Switalskis, the Marzchals, the
Glamkowskis _ to settle in Wisconsin in the late 1800s?
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, I very much wanted to know. So more than a century
later, I joined another great migration, becoming one of the
millions of baby boomers who are going on line to search for their
pasts, using online databases and mailing lists as tools to hunt
elusive ancestors and creating untold numbers of family-tree home
pages.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem odd to use today's technology to recapture the past
(or, if necessary, to reinvent it). But for a generation living in
a cultural climate that celebrates ethnicity, a generation far
removed from immigrant ancestors who were desperate to assimilate,
the quest for the past makes perfect sense. Instead of dwelling on
why I never knew _ or cared _ enough to ask my grandparents about
Alice while they were still alive, I conjured the comforting memory
of my grandmother patiently trying to teach me to say ``little
bird'' in Polish as we watered the dozens of African violets that
sat on chipped saucers on her dining-room radiator.
</P>
<P>
   I started at the personal home page of Steve Lacy, a Florida
resident who created his Web site in 1995 after years of doing
genealogical research to track his English and French ancestors
 &UR; (www.gengateway.com/ &LR;   &UR; mainsite.htm) &LR; . The page links to more than
42,000 other sites, including genealogy mailing lists, government
databases and other family-tree home pages. Within minutes you can
search for family surnames, look up old property records and peruse
historical maps for almost any area of the world.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internet is only a jumping-off point. For a serious
genealogist, the most valuable form of currency is a reliable
document that lists dates and places, like a birth certificate, a
baptismal record or naturalization papers. You will probably not
find those on line. But if you know where in the United States
someone died, you can go to  &UR; www.rootsweb.com &LR;  (start with States
in the menu bar) to find an address to write for a copy of the
death certificate, as well as information about how much the
document will cost and whether you must be an immediate family
member to get it. On a site run by volunteers,  &UR; www.usgenweb.org &LR; ,
I was amazed to be able to find someone in Wisconsin who offered to
go to the local courthouse to look up old records for me.
</P>
<P>
   Then I conducted searches on two commercial genealogical sites
and found the dates of death of two great-aunts (but nothing about
Alice). It was worth a visit to the two sites _  &UR; www.ancestry.com &LR; 
and Broderbund Software's  &UR; www.familytreemaker. &LR;   &UR; com &LR;  _ if only
for their free services. Both offer the Social Security Death
Index, which has records of more than 50 million people who died
between 1937 and 1997. Searching the index is free.
Familytreemaker.com will also generate a form letter you can print
and mail to get a copy of a Social Security card application. I was
thrilled to find my great-aunts and grandparents listed.
</P>
<P>
   But I was less thrilled with the portions of the commercial Web
sites that cost money to use. Ancestry.com, for instance, has
nearly 600 databases, most searchable only by subscribers. I paid
$19.95 for a three-month subscription only to learn after hours of
scouring needle-in-a-haystack databases like American Marriages
Before 1699 and Biographical Dictionary of Canadian Jewry,
1897-1909 that the site apparently had no useful information about
my family.
</P>
<P>
   At familytreemaker.com, a free search showed that my
great-grandfather, Anton Slotalla (a variant spelling), was listed
on a CD-ROM, part of the Family Tree Maker's Family Archives,
called Passenger and Immigration Lists Index 1538-1940.
</P>
<P>
   I started to envision a romantic sea crossing, with my
grandfather standing on deck, his arm around the shoulder of__ was
that Alice? But learning the cost quelled my enthusiasm; the CD-ROM
costs $49.99 and Broderbund recommends that you purchase its Family
Tree Maker software, on 10 CD's, for $89.99 to run Family Archives.
(A free program from Broderbund would also run the CD-ROM, I
learned from Claire LeBeaux, a company spokeswoman.)
</P>
<P>
   After Ms. LeBeaux sent me evaluation copies of both commercial
products, I eagerly ripped open the package. But instead of the
information that the CD-ROM box promised (my grandfather's age, the
year and place of immigration, the names of the family members who
traveled with him), a sketchy entry informed me that Anton Slotalla
was naturalized in 1914. I already knew that! The entry also
referred me to a more detailed index of naturalization papers more
than a thousand miles away. It was valuable information, but hardly
worth $50.
</P>
<P>
   So much for my romantic fantasies, which I now realize were
prompted in part by a different kind of search _ for evidence that
an easy familiarity with technology will help us transform our
ideas about ourselves. I gave up awhile back on the idea that
online communities would spring up to change our relationships with
one another. But maybe sudden access to enormous troves of
genealogical information will change my relationship to the past.
Or at least to Alice.

<P>
   In early 1939, when the news reached me of the discovery of
fission, I was working in the Radiological Laboratory in Warsaw. I
had already begun to experiment with uranium, so it did not take me
long to set up an experiment to see whether neutrons are emitted at
fission.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it soon became clear that they are _ more neutrons are
emitted than produce fission. From this discovery it was a fairly
simple intellectual exercise to envisage a divergent chain reaction
with a vast release of energy.
</P>
<P>
   The logical sequel was that if this energy were released in a
very short time it would result in an explosion of unprecedented
power.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists in other countries, doing this type of research,
went through a similar thought process, although not necessarily
evoking the same reaction.
</P>
<P>
   In my case, my first reflex was to put the whole thing out of my
mind, like a person trying to ignore the first symptom of a fatal
disease in the hope that it will go away. But fear gnawed at me all
the same, and my fear was that someone would put the idea into
practice.
</P>
<P>
   At that time my life was centered on doing ``pure'' research
work, but I always believed that science should be used in the
service of mankind. The notion of utilizing my knowledge to produce
an awesome weapon of destruction was abhorrent to me.
</P>
<P>
   In my gnawing fear, the ``someone'' who might put it into
practice was precisely defined: German scientists. I had no doubt
that the Nazis would not hesitate to use any device, however
inhumane, if it gave their doctrine world domination. I convinced
myself that the only way to stop the Germans from using it against
us would be if we too had the bomb and threatened to retaliate.
</P>
<P>
   My scenario never envisaged that we should use it, not even
against the Germans. We needed the bomb for the sole purpose of
making sure that it would not be used by them.
</P>
<P>
   During this time I moved to England to spend a year with
Professor James Chadwick at Liverpool University on a grant to work
on the cyclotron, which was being completed there.
</P>
<P>
   The war broke out two days after I got to Liverpool. Within a
few weeks Poland was overrun. The stories that Hitler's military
strength was all bluff, that his tanks were painted cardboard,
turned out to be wishful thinking. The might of Germany stood
revealed, and the whole of our civilization was in mortal peril.
</P>
<P>
   By November 1939 I approached Chadwick directly with an outline
of my plan for research on the feasibility of the atomic bomb. My
main idea was that for the atom bomb the chain reaction would have
to be propagated by fast neutrons. Otherwise it would not differ
much from a chemical explosive.
</P>
<P>
   We built up a small team of young but devoted physicists and
used the cyclotron to tackle some of the problems. Later we were
joined by Otto Frisch who measured fast-neutron fission
cross-sections for uranium-235. I had the idea of using plutonium,
but we had no means of making it.
</P>
<P>
   It became clear that in order to make the bomb, a vast
technological effort would be required, far exceeding the manpower
and industrial potential of wartime Britain. A top-level decision
was reached to collaborate with America. And so I found myself
eventually in that ``wondrous strange'' place _ Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In March 1944 I was living with the Chadwicks in their house on
the Mesa. Gen. Leslie Groves, when visiting Los Alamos, frequently
came to the Chadwicks for dinner and relaxed palaver.
</P>
<P>
   During one such conversation, Groves said the real purpose in
making the bomb was to subdue the Soviets. Whatever his exact
words, his real meaning was clear.
</P>
<P>
   Until then I had thought our work was to prevent a Nazi victory,
and now I was told that the weapon we were preparing was intended
for use against the very people who then were making extreme
sacrifices against Hitler's troops.
</P>
<P>
   Niels Bohr used to come to my room at 8 a.m. to listen to the
BBC news bulletin. Sometimes Bohr stayed on and talked to me about
the social and political implications of the discovery of nuclear
energy and his worry about the dire consequences of a nuclear-arms
race between East and West which he foresaw.
</P>
<P>
   All this, and the growing evidence that the war in Europe would
be over before the bomb project was completed, made my
participation in it pointless.
</P>
<P>
   When it became evident, toward the end of 1944, that the Germans
had abandoned their bomb project, the whole purpose of my being in
Los Alamos ceased to be, and I asked for permission to leave and
return to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Why did other scientists not make the same decision? The most
frequent reason so many of them stayed on the project apparently
was pure and simple scientific curiosity _ the strong urge to find
out whether their theoretical calculations and predictions would
come true.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the scientists felt that only after the now-legendary
test at Alamogordo should they enter into the debate about the use
of the bomb. Only when peace was restored would they take a hand in
efforts to ensure that the bomb would not be used again.
</P>
<P>
   Still others, while agreeing that the project should have been
stopped when the German factor ceased to exist, were not willing to
take an individual stand because they feared it would adversely
affect their future career.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of scientists were not bothered by moral scruples.
They were quite content to leave it to others to decide how their
work would be used.
</P>
<P>
   As for myself, work on the atom bomb was proof that even pure
research soon finds applications of one kind or another. If so, I
wanted to decide how my work should be applied. I chose an aspect
of nuclear physics which would definitely be beneficial to
humanity: the applications to medicine. Thus I completely changed
the direction of my research and spent the rest of my academic
career working in a medical college and hospital.
</P>
<P>
   While this gave me personal satisfaction, I was increasingly
concerned about the personal aspects of the development of nuclear
weapons, particularly the hydrogen bomb, about which I knew from
Los Alamos. Therefore I devoted myself both to arousing the
scientific community to the danger, and to educating the general
public on these issues.
</P>
<P>
   I was instrumental in setting up the Atomic Scientists
Association in the United Kingdom, and within its framework
organized the Atom Train, a traveling exhibition which explained to
the public the good and evil aspects of nuclear energy.
</P>
<P>
   Through these activities I came to collaborate with Bertrand
Russell. This association led to the foundation of the Pugwash
Conferences, where I met again with colleagues from the Manhattan
Project, who were also concerned about the threat to mankind that
has arisen partly from their work.
</P>
<P>
   After so many years it seems to me that our concepts of morality
seem to get thrown overboard once military action starts. It is,
therefore, most important not to allow such a situation to develop.
</P>
<P>
   Our prime effort must concentrate on the prevention of nuclear
war because in such a war not only mortality but the whole fabric
of civilization would disappear. Eventually, it is clear, we must
aim at eliminating all kinds of war.
</P>
<P>

Nobel Peace Prize, jointly with the Pugwash Conferences on Science
and World Affairs, in London, which he helped to found in 1955.
This commentary is based on an article about his experience on The
Manhattan Project which first appeared in The Bulletin of the
Atomic Scientists in August, 1985.) &LR;

AUGUST FOLLIES: BLAIR'S ITALIAN HOLIDAY OPENS CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>
   News Analysis  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A few weeks ago, few British people had ever heard of
Italian Prince Girolamo Strozzi. Now, as Prime Minister Tony
Blair's host at his 50-room villa in Tuscany, he's assured at least
a footnote in history.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that when the wealthy nobleman invited Blair and
his family to spend 10 days as his guests this month, he was soon
informed that he and his own family would have to move out of the
spacious 18th century villa to provide the British leader with
``total privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   An official entourage of more than 40 Blair aides and security
staffers was also expected to stay at the villa in the countryside
near Florence.
</P>
<P>
   This incident not only touched off protests in Italy, where it
was considered hard formaggio on the unfortunate Strozzi, but also
ignited sharp debate in Britain over Blair's alleged
``presidential'' airs.
</P>
<P>
   Belatedly, Blair apologized, and the prince was allowed to
remain in his ancestral home, but the damage was done.
</P>
<P>
   The whole thing was all the more a public relations disaster for
Blair since Strozzi offered his hospitality on the spur of the
moment when the two briefly met last summer while Blair was staying
nearby. Strozzi's wife Irina was quoted by Italian newspapers as
confiding that ``she would have something to say later to him''
about making such generous gestures.
</P>
<P>
   British prime ministers traditionally have conducted themselves
in much more modest fashion than American presidents. Prime
ministers live and work in a small house, No. 10 Downing Street,
where a single policeman stands guard at the front door. Unlike
presidents, they are not chiefs of state and historically have had
none of the trappings of that status, which in Britain belongs to
the non-ruling and unpolitical monarch.
</P>
<P>
   To remind them that they're merely first among equals, they're
expected to spend several hours each week in the House of Commons
where they are exposed to the debating brickbats of their
parliamentary foes. Even Winston Churchill was treated with no
particular respect by his fellow members of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Nor have past prime ministers traveled in grand style
accompanied by hordes of aides in White House fashion. Margaret
Thatcher spent her summer holidays in Switzerland at the home of an
old friend with a single secretary _ and no flock of news reporters
_ in attendance. Blair's predecessor, John Major, took his wife
Norma to a small, unglamorous hotel at the Spanish seaside.
</P>
<P>
   However, the attempt by Blair's aides to evict Strozzi from his
villa is viewed by critics as the latest of several efforts to give
the prime ministerial office a distinctly presidential flavor, in
effect changing Britain's famous unwritten constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office 15 months ago, Blair has been accused of
ignoring parliament, spending little time there and, contrary to
former practice, repeatedly revealing policy proposals through the
media _ again, in White House style _ before presenting them to
parliament. So-called ``prime minister's question time,'' when
members of parliament are given a chance to interrogate him
directly, has been reduced from two hours to a half hour a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blair is in awe of all that power at Bill Clinton's fingertips
and wants to possess more of the same kind of power for Number
10,'' according to William Worden, a historian who has written
several books on British politics. ~~``It's not wholly ego on his
part. He thinks effective government needs power and mystique
invested in the person at the top.''
</P>
<P>
   And if that means giving the Strozzi family a rough time, so be
it.

TEXAS TASTES LIKE HEAVEN TO STEPHAN PYLES FANS

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Stephan Pyles' New Tastes From Texas'' (Potter, $18.95) is the
companion book to the Dallas chef's TV cooking series by the same
name. If the series has inspired you to try some of Pyles' recipes,
the book is a mandatory ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   Pyles' shows are so packed with recipes _ many of them quite
complicated _ that it would take a stenographer to get them down on
paper. With the cookbook, readers get not only the recipes but also
the techniques common to Southwestern fare: roasting fresh chiles,
pureeing dried chiles and preparing pure chile powder.
</P>
<P>
   The book's recipes range from the simple twists on Texas
classics to complicated creations such as Star Canyon's trademark
heaven and hell cake. Here are two examples:
</P>
<P>
   JALAPENOS STUFFED WITH CHORIZO AND GOAT CHEESE
</P>
<P>
   Yields 24 stuffed halves
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    ISRAELIS VOW TO CONTINUE PEACE TALKS DESPITE WEST BANK SHOOTINGS
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli leaders vowed Wednesday to continue peace
talks with Palestinians, despite the early morning ambush and
murder of two Jewish settlers in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the negotiations to continue, but this highlights the
issues that are of concern to us,'' Israeli government spokesman
Moshe Fogel said.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was under pressure from
right-wing groups opposed to the peace process to suspend
negotiations after the killing of the two settlers.
</P>
<P>
   According to reports in the Israeli press, the settlers were
conducting a routine citizen patrol around their settlement of
Itzhar shortly after midnight when they were ambushed apparently by
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Their pick-up truck was riddled with bullets. Police said the
gunmen shot them several times, including in the head from close
range, and took the M-16 assault rifle carried by one of the
victims.
</P>
<P>
   Itzhar is one of about 150 Jewish housing developments, called
settlements, in the West Bank land that was captured by Israel in
the 1967 war. Many are near Arab towns.
</P>
<P>
   The settlements have come under international criticism for
violating conventions against moving populations into occupied
territories. But, many Israelis see the settlements as staking out
traditionally Jewish land that is also important to protect
Israel's borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to be broken. Nobody's going to murder us and
expect us to leave these areas,'' said Yehudit Tamar, spokeswoman
for YESHA, one of the settler associations.
</P>
<P>
   She said the settlers would seek to expand the settlement and
establish a new neighborhood on the spot where the two men were
killed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Land near the settlements is a sticking point in the
negotiations that have been proceeding slowly between Israelis and
Palestinians. Under the Oslo peace agreement, Israel is expected to
return West Bank land in exchange for a halt to Palestinian
violence.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians have accepted a U.S. proposal for the next
phase of the land turnover, but Israel has not, stating that the
Palestinians have not done enough to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli leaders said Wednesday they would continue the talks,
but reemphasize their demands for a Palestinian crackdown on
attacks like the one committed against the Itzhar settlers.

   You've gotten your Whopper meal for lunch at the Burger King at
182 Broadway in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   What's next?
</P>
<P>
   Let's see ... napkins, straw, salt packet, mustard, e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. E-mail.
</P>
<P>
   It's available at the world's first Internet-enabled Burger King
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Nestled near New York's financial district in lower Manhattan,
the fast-food joint lets its customers not only hoard the
condiments and cardboard crowns but also access any of the 20
high-speed Internet stations ... by king-sizing your Value Meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers are sending and receiving e-mail, checking their
stocks and financial news, looking for apartments and jobs,
obtaining travel information, joining chat groups and playing
various interactive games,'' Peter Allen Abramson, Burger King
franchisee, said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes dining, particularly alone, more enjoyable.''
</P>
<P>
   Abramson's customers _ some tourists, some residential, but
mostly from nearby Wall Street _ are allowed 20 minutes to navigate
the Web from high-speed T-1 connections. A two-minute-warning
message appears on the monitor when Internet access is about to be
terminated. Filtering technology prevents access to inappropriate
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Abramson said the concept for the restaurant ``just came in my
head one day.'' The location of his business, which has stiff
competition from other fast-food restaurants, meant he had to have
a niche; ``I had to get something to differentiate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What are the chances of Burger King starting a cybercafe
elsewhere?
</P>
<P>
   Abramson answers in his news release: ``I will make my
technology available to other franchisees. It is a concept I want
to share with the entire Burger King system.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's will probably answer the challenge with something
called Power Big Macs or McInternet.

   IF YOU DIG TEXAS
</P>
<P>
   The Texas State Library and Archives Commission has found a way
for those interested in state history to get a closer look at
fragile artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's Texas Treasures site
(www.tsl.state.tx.us/lobby/treasures) features digitally scanned
images of resources from the State Archives' holdings.
</P>
<P>
   The artifacts include William B. Travis' letter from the Alamo;
county-by-county vote totals from the 1845 Texas referendum on
annexation; and a collection of flags from the Texas Revolution and
Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   State archivist Christopher LaPlante said the site will remain a
work in progress. ``We've just begun to scratch the surface,'' he
said. _ Tommy Cummings, (817) 390-7397 dragon\Nstar-telegram.com

 By OSCAR ARIAS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Despite the end of the Cold War, it is the international arms
trade in which power and position generate enormous profit to the
detriment of millions.
 &HT;    In developing countries, enough basic health services and
clinical care to save 10 million lives could be paid for with less
than half the yearly outlay on military weapons, equipment and
manpower. In developed countries, governments spend 10 times more
on their military ``defense'' than on development aid to the poorer
nations.
 &HT;    When war becomes business, for every individual who prospers,
millions despair.
 &HT;    How can the world spend more than $750 billion per year on
weapons and armed forces while 1 billion people languish in
poverty?
 &HT;    How can the developed nations spend as much on military power
each year as the poorest 2 billion people on our planet earn in
total income? How can we accept a world that spends 25 times more
on maintaining a soldier than it does on educating a child?
 &HT;    Surely the continued arms trade represents one of the most
pervasive forms of corruption.
 &HT;    But corruption requires at least two parties: the consumer and
the supplier. Political and military leaders in many countries,
ignoring the needs of their people, often encourage arms purchases
and stockpiling; we know that in many cases they have been able to
personally reap financial gain from such transactions. Meanwhile,
the weapons often become tools to thwart democratic processes and
oppress the people.
 &HT;    And which countries are behind the lucrative arms industry? The
nations that supply the majority of the world's conventional arms
deliveries are none other than the five permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council _ the United States, the former Soviet Union,
France, the United Kingdom and China.
 &HT;    The new political environment created by the end of the Cold War
allows for new perspectives and new priorities. It is imperative
that we take advantage of the world's unprecedented opportunity for
peace.
 &HT;    The people of all nations, both rich and poor, benefit when
resources are redirected from the pursuit of war to the pursuit of
education, development, health and peace.
 &HT;    For many years now, I have been proposing the establishment of a
Global Demilitarization Fund. In brief, the idea is to create a
fund that will allow the world to take advantage of the heralded _
but elusive _ peace dividend.
 &HT;    Nations would make voluntary contributions to the fund from
savings they earned through reductions in military spending. The
Fund could stimulate the decline in military spending by linking
money saved on weapons and military manpower to the consolidation
of world peace.
 &HT;    The nations of the world, both rich and poor, should commit
themselves to an annual reduction of at least 3 percent in
military-spending levels over the next five years.
 &HT;    The rich nations then should agree to earmark at least one-fifth
of these savings for a demilitarization fund which is under
international jurisdiction. Developing countries should also agree
to contribute a fraction, perhaps one-tenth, of these savings
toward such a fund.
 &HT;    In this manner, a portion of the peace dividend would be
available to commit to promoting global demilitarization and to
fund a U.N. standing force.
 &HT;    The Global Demilitarization Fund would be an important step
toward achieving human security. It might be managed by the World
Bank and U.N. agencies endowed with sufficient authority to
administer its resources justly and efficiently.
 &HT;    The goals of the Fund would be, first, to create and use the
peace dividend; second, to speed and encourage the global processes
of demilitarization, demobilization and conversion; and third, to
help less-developed countries further their own democratic and
human-development plans.
 &HT;    It is impossible to achieve development and peace when the
countries most desperately in need of resources fail to invest in
their people and instead allocate significant funds to buying
weapons from the developed nations. These shipments can only lead
to growing instability, decreased public security and the
possibility of increased death and destruction.
 &HT;    Corruption must be eradicated in all of its forms. It is a
deadly contradiction to promote war through the proliferation of
weapons while preaching the need for peace.

 By OSCAR ARIAS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Despite the end of the Cold War, it is the international arms
trade in which power and position generate enormous profit to the
detriment of millions.
 &HT;    In developing countries, enough basic health services and
clinical care to save 10 million lives could be paid for with less
than half the yearly outlay on military weapons, equipment and
manpower. In developed countries, governments spend 10 times more
on their military ``defense'' than on development aid to the poorer
nations.
 &HT;    When war becomes business, for every individual who prospers,
millions despair.
 &HT;    How can the world spend more than $750 billion per year on
weapons and armed forces while 1 billion people languish in
poverty?
 &HT;    How can the developed nations spend as much on military power
each year as the poorest 2 billion people on our planet earn in
total income? How can we accept a world that spends 25 times more
on maintaining a soldier than it does on educating a child?
 &HT;    Surely the continued arms trade represents one of the most
pervasive forms of corruption.
 &HT;    But corruption requires at least two parties: the consumer and
the supplier. Political and military leaders in many countries,
ignoring the needs of their people, often encourage arms purchases
and stockpiling; we know that in many cases they have been able to
personally reap financial gain from such transactions. Meanwhile,
the weapons often become tools to thwart democratic processes and
oppress the people.
 &HT;    And which countries are behind the lucrative arms industry? The
nations that supply the majority of the world's conventional arms
deliveries are none other than the five permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council _ the United States, the former Soviet Union,
France, the United Kingdom and China.
 &HT;    The new political environment created by the end of the Cold War
allows for new perspectives and new priorities. It is imperative
that we take advantage of the world's unprecedented opportunity for
peace.
 &HT;    The people of all nations, both rich and poor, benefit when
resources are redirected from the pursuit of war to the pursuit of
education, development, health and peace.
 &HT;    For many years now, I have been proposing the establishment of a
Global Demilitarization Fund. In brief, the idea is to create a
fund that will allow the world to take advantage of the heralded _
but elusive _ peace dividend.
 &HT;    Nations would make voluntary contributions to the fund from
savings they earned through reductions in military spending. The
Fund could stimulate the decline in military spending by linking
money saved on weapons and military manpower to the consolidation
of world peace.
 &HT;    The nations of the world, both rich and poor, should commit
themselves to an annual reduction of at least 3 percent in
military-spending levels over the next five years.
 &HT;    The rich nations then should agree to earmark at least one-fifth
of these savings for a demilitarization fund which is under
international jurisdiction. Developing countries should also agree
to contribute a fraction, perhaps one-tenth, of these savings
toward such a fund.
 &HT;    In this manner, a portion of the peace dividend would be
available to commit to promoting global demilitarization and to
fund a U.N. standing force.
 &HT;    The Global Demilitarization Fund would be an important step
toward achieving human security. It might be managed by the World
Bank and U.N. agencies endowed with sufficient authority to
administer its resources justly and efficiently.
 &HT;    The goals of the Fund would be, first, to create and use the
peace dividend; second, to speed and encourage the global processes
of demilitarization, demobilization and conversion; and third, to
help less-developed countries further their own democratic and
human-development plans.
 &HT;    It is impossible to achieve development and peace when the
countries most desperately in need of resources fail to invest in
their people and instead allocate significant funds to buying
weapons from the developed nations. These shipments can only lead
to growing instability, decreased public security and the
possibility of increased death and destruction.
 &HT;    Corruption must be eradicated in all of its forms. It is a
deadly contradiction to promote war through the proliferation of
weapons while preaching the need for peace.

WEB HELPS INVESTORS TURN TIME INTO MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By BARBARA WADE ROSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andrew Stern, a retired professor of journalism in Berkeley,
Calif., spends two to four hours a day managing his investment
portfolio, about 65 percent mutual funds and 35 percent stocks. It
would take less time for Stern to deal with a broker (he used to
have an account with one of the larger firms), but he says he gets
better service and financial information with a handful of
personal-finance Web sites he visits daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web changed my life,'' said Stern, who began using a
computer in 1983. ``It makes it possible to get my education and
manage my own portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   Personal-finance Web sites have evolved a great deal since the
misc. invest newsgroups of the old Usenet featured investors
complaining about their brokers and holding forth on fledgling
companies like Sun Microsystems. The Web has leveled the
personal-investment playing field between brokers and clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been investing for 20 years now,'' said Ronald Guest, who
owns a management consulting service in Dallas and whose own
portfolio is 45 percent equities and mutual funds and 55 percent
cash and bonds. ``Before, you might find that one of your stocks
had gone up or down,'' he said, but the secrecy and favoritism many
full-service brokerages practiced in favor of their wealthiest
clients meant that ``it took forever to find out why.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the many sites that Guest visits is an esoteric little
number called Plane Business, a subscription site written by Holly
Hegeman, an analyst and industry expert  &UR; (www.planebusiness.com) &LR; .
Guest swears by her analyses, citing Ms. Hegeman's timely
disclosure recently that aircraft builders in the Far East were
secretly speeding through their contracts, perhaps in preparation
for a pullout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago,'' he said, ``the only way you could find such
people as Hegeman was through full-service brokers.'' These days,
they are just as likely to be on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The personal-finance Web sites you see here take a variety of
approaches to attract the online investor. Yahoo and Invest-o-rama
both direct you to sources of documents and carry little analysis,
but they also differ sharply. While Invest-o-rama is a one-man
operation that reflects individual tastes and convictions, Yahoo
uses the resources of a network search engine to provide extensive,
up-to-date opinions. By contrast, The Street is highly opinionated
and analytical, geared to investment lovers. The Motley Fool, based
in Virginia, is a site for outsiders. Because it relies extensively
on contributors' opinions, it is a free-for-all.
</P>
<P>
   Three of these sites (Yahoo, Invest-o-rama and Motley Fool) are
mostly free but may lead you to subscriber links; The Street caters
almost entirely to subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Other interesting sites are Excite's Money and Investing, which
can lead you to good information links  &UR; (www.excite.com) &LR; . Much of
Excite's investment information comes from Quicken, another free
general-interest finance site  &UR; (www.quicken.com) &LR; . Hoover's Online
offers a directory of thousands of companies for $119.95 annually
 &UR; (www.hoovers.com) &LR; , but if you are seeking annual reports, you can
get them free from the Public Register's Annual Report Service
 &UR; (www.prars.com) &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   On-line trading hyperlinks, now offered by most personal finance
sites, can resound with the alluring ka-ching of a Las Vegas slot
machine arm. They are fast and easy to use. The big drawback: there
is no kindly, conservative broker leaning through the computer
screen to suggest that putting all that money into a junior mining
stock may be a trifle hasty. It is probably better to accumulate
more time on the investment sites themselves first. Both Stern and
Guest spend sizable portions of their days visiting their sites and
making investment decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people can't do it,'' Stern acknowledged. ``But I
know from friends that I've done better than friends who've gone to
brokers. With no more risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo Offers a Place to Start
</P>
<P>
   WWW.YAHOO.COM
</P>
<P>
   While many browsers and far too many media sites offer a
financial component intended to attract the fledgling investor on
the Internet, Yahoo decided to make a site that was of real value
to people in the business. At a recent conference on technology
stocks, Andrew Stern noticed that nearly all the brokers soliciting
his business used Yahoo as their launching pad for financial
information. ``It's an incredible source,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Personal Finance link on the home page leads to news,
organized into categories like initial public offerings, industry
information and the latest from Standard &AMP; Poor's. Latest Market
News, a separate category, includes the time each headline was
posted so investors know how fresh the information is. Investors
with international holdings may also want to link to Yahoo
financial sites in Europe and Japan (written in Japanese). Each
article includes links to more stories on a company's product _ the
auto industry in general, for example, if you are interested in
General Motors _ or related news.
</P>
<P>
   Message boards cover investors' and insiders' interest in a
current topic. A look at a board in late July showed that more than
12,000 messages had addressed the impending initial public offering
of a company called Tigershark. (Messages are sometimes of dubious
value; the Tigershark discussions featured little more than
posturing by employees about to cash in their options.)
</P>
<P>
   A valuable additional resource on Yahoo is a free service called
My Yahoo, which can be customized and is accessible from the top of
the home page. Ronald Guest uses the service to flag news for him
on a dozen or so companies. What he gets is timely information like
the recent early morning posting of one company's quarterly
earnings before the markets opened. That gave him time to plot his
portfolio strategy.
</P>
<P>
   If Yahoo has any bias, it is that of refraining from committing
itself to a particular point of view. Stern noted that he was
``getting raw facts.'' Ronald Guest, too, stressed that Yahoo was
pure news and information with ``no analysis.''

   The Street: For Investors With Passion
</P>
<P>
   WWW.THESTREET.COM
</P>
<P>
   A subscriber service, The Street was started in late 1996 by a
finance guru, James J. Cramer, and his partner, Martin Peretz, the
owner and editor in chief of The New Republic. ``At the time, there
was not the kind of intense focus in investment news,'' said Jamie
Heller, executive editor at the site. ``And with 6,000 mutual funds
and 10,000 stocks out there, we felt there was room for more
coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Cramer's favorite pronouncements could be the mantra of
the Internet investor. ``Investing is so important you shouldn't
leave it to others,'' he said in a recent profile in GQ magazine.
``If you paid as much attention to your money as you do to sports,
you'd do as well.'' It would be difficult to do as well as Cramer,
who trades only for clients with multimillion-dollar portfolios. He
gets to work every day before dawn and keeps six screens running in
his Wall Street office. One screen, called the shark screen,
continuously displays the fluctuations of his favorite 50 stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Cramer's site is for personal investors who love investing. Two
e-mail bulletins are sent each day to subscribers, who can visit
the site to link to related stories. The coverage includes six
market stories a day (they are free); subscribers get two bond
stories a day. The site also dabbles in money markets and plans to
have customized corporate bulletins in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   A rather patronizingly named hyperlink called the Schoolhouse
offers useful, well-written articles on basic investment how-tos _
price-earnings ratios, tracking company performance and trading _
for ``people who want to get started,'' Ms. Heller said.
</P>
<P>
   You cannot get far on the site without paying a membership fee
of $99.95 a year or $9.95 a month, but membership gives you value
for your money: daily investment news bulletins prepared by a staff
of 40 writers and analysts who work under what the site says are
``the toughest disclosure rules in the media industry.'' None of
its reporters may own stock or financial interests in companies,
except in mutual funds. Freelance contributors in New York,
Washington and San Francisco round out The Street's coverage, which
both Guest and Stern called the Web's best for investment analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The Street's writers also give better coverage than major
newspapers, Stern said, ``and they have a really skeptical
attitude.'' The site is also proud of its electronic reliability:
in 1997, The Street handed its technical operations over to
Starwave, a high-tech subsidiary of Disney and ABC News. Ms. Heller
said The Street was one of the few sites not to go down during the
computer crash that temporarily disabled Wall Street later that
year.
</P>
<P>
   Motley Fool Has Visitors Chiming In
</P>
<P>
   WWW.MOTLEYFOOL.COM
</P>
<P>
   At the Motley Fool Web site, the fact that its contributing
analysts might own stock in a given company is the entire point.
There are some 100 paid employees and 25 contributors to the site,
based in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are one large foolish investing community,'' said Chris
Hill, the site's media relations director, ``and we are all
contributing.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporate analysis on the site, which David and Tom Gardner
began in 1994, is written by staff members, many of whom are former
brokers. The Fool's School section provides the site's educational
component, with all the information rendered in easy-to-understand,
even jolly, language.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fool's flavor is largely provided by its 750,000 monthly
visitors, who offer their opinions, experience and tips on the
site's bulletin boards. Hill said the cooperative nature of the
site, which eschews the idea of experts dispensing advice, ``gives
us a leg up.'' The join-in atmosphere includes message boards that
more experienced investors use to discuss their favorite stocks and
online finance clubs that allow you to eavesdrop on their
deliberations. If you decide that an investor's analysis and
commentary are particularly valuable or amusing, you can ask to
read an archive of that person's postings to the site.
</P>
<P>
   An example of just how investors without online access can fall
behind wired investors: ``Gardners' Motley Fool Investment Guide''
(Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1997), written by the site's founders, extolled
the virtues of Iomega, the Zip drive maker; in late July 1998, the
Motley Fool Web site was decidedly bearish.
</P>
<P>
   Mixing Analysis With Fun
</P>
<P>
   WWW.INVESTORAMA.COM
</P>
<P>
   With a staff of one, the founder of Invest-o-rama, Douglas
Gerlach, manages to create an impressive and free resource with
investment information that is user-friendly for beginning
investors, a job he calls ``putting the fun back into fundamental
analysis.'' Gerlach began the site in 1995 with his own collection
of some 200 Web-site bookmarks that he had collected as a volunteer
for the National Association of Investors. He was struck both by
how little of value he had found _ ``you had to search long and
hard to find any useful information,'' he said _ and also by how
quickly the Web was growing.
</P>
<P>
   Gerlach has made a successful career out of his research. He
wrote ``The Investor's Web Guide'' (Ziff-Davis, 1997), founded the
Pioneer Online Investment Club and teaches seminars in addition to
running the site, which gets around 75,000 visitors a month. ``I am
not an investment professional, and when I started the site I was
learning a lot about investing myself,'' he said. ``It was
overwhelming at times, and I try to remember that.''
</P>
<P>
   Invest-o-rama features hard information rather than in-depth
analyses. The site, supported entirely by advertising, has click-on
services for news, information and hundreds of online sources that
can lead you in interesting directions. Gerlach himself provides a
small amount of original commentary for Invest-o-rama, including a
column as well as fun and games, like a link called How to Build a
Million-Dollar Portfolio. The page tells how investors with a broad
range of salaries can build up to stocks and bonds worth a million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   On one occasion, though, a click on the $40,000 to $49,999 range
crashed the program, perhaps the computer's equivalent of a hearty
laugh.

GULF VETS NOT ILL FROM EXPOSURE TO TOXIC DEBRIS, PENTAGON SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATHLEEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Battlefield exposures to the toxic debris
created by U.S. weapons in the Persian Gulf are not the cause of
undiagnosed illnesses among veterans, the Pentagon has announced in
a new study.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans' advocates denounced the finding, contained in a
121-page report released Tuesday, calling it a fabrication that
contradicts the preliminary findings of a Department of Veterans
Affairs study.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the people looking into the microscopes _ not the
propaganda artists at the Pentagon who have a policy of promoting
the use of depleted uranium ammunition,'' said Paul Sullivan,
executive director of the National Gulf War Resource Center, a
Washington, D.C.-based coalition of veterans groups.
</P>
<P>
   The report also drew fire from radiation expert Rosalie Bertell,
president of the International Institute for Public Health, a
nonprofit research center in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Bertell said the Pentagon ``missed the boat on the biology'' by
focusing on the effects of immediate, high-level exposure to
depleted uranium _ kidney damage _ and neglecting the long-term
health hazards linked to radiation, such as cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's report analyzes the health threat posed by the
use of depleted uranium (DU) ammunition in the 1991 Persian Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
   The ammunition, fired by U.S. tanks and aircraft, is made of a
heavy metal that is radioactive. Pentagon officials say it blasts
through tanks ``like a hot knife through butter.''
</P>
<P>
   The ammunition was used for the first time in combat in the Gulf
War, and soldiers were not warned that inhaling, ingesting or
absorbing its radioactive and toxic residue could cause cancer or
respiratory, kidney and skin disorders.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the Pentagon analyzed 13 scenarios in which
soldiers may have come into contact with DU dust or debris, and
classified them into three groups.
</P>
<P>
   Level 1: Soldiers in vehicles accidentally hit by U.S. tanks,
and those who entered the vehicles to rescue them.
</P>
<P>
   ``These soldiers could have been struck by DU fragments, inhaled
DU aerosols, ingested DU residues, or had DU particles land on open
wounds, burns or other breaks in their skin,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Level 2: Soldiers (and some civilians) who inspected, repaired
or moved contaminated tanks, and soldiers who took part in the
cleanup after the explosions and 18-hour fire at the Camp Doha
ammunition depot in Kuwait after the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``These soldiers may have inhaled DU residues stirred up
(resuspended) during their activities on or inside the vehicles,
transferred DU from hand to mouth, thus ingesting it, or spread
contamination on their clothing,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Level 3: Soldiers exposed to smoke from the fires at Camp Doha,
smoke from burning U.S. or Iraqi tanks, and soldiers who entered
contaminated tanks on the battlefield after combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``While these individuals could have inhaled airborne DU
particles, the possibility of receiving an intake high enough to
cause health effects is extremely remote,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon announced Tuesday that the 300 soldiers considered
to be in levels 1 and 2 will be offered special medical screenings
_ joining a health monitoring program for 33 veterans already under
way at the Baltimore VA Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``While their DU exposures are unlikely to have exceeded the
threshold levels at which health effects might be observed,
prudence dictates that they be evaluated to establish any residual
body burden of DU,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bernard Rostker, head of the Pentagon's office of the
special assistant on Gulf War illnesses, said there appears to be
no link between exposures and ailments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report's conclusion, based on a comprehensive review of
available data and a science-based methodology, is that exposures
to DU's heavy metal (chemical) toxicity or low-level radiation are
not a cause of the undiagnosed illnesses afflicting some Gulf War
veterans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rostker's office is investigating the puzzling symptoms and
debilitating illnesses reported by about 100,000 of the 700,000
U.S. men and women who served in the gulf.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Rostker said thousands of soldiers may have been
exposed to depleted uranium during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans and veterans' advocates blasted the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm not sick,'' said Doug Rokke, an Army Reserve
captain who has suffered from kidney, respiratory and skin
disorders since the war.
</P>
<P>
   Rokke, a radiation expert, inspected tanks hit by depleted
uranium during Gulf War battles. After the war, he helped design
the Army's DU training program.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, of the National Gulf War Resource Center, said the
report shows the Pentagon and the VA are miles apart on the issue
of health effects of depleted uranium exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the VA issued a directive to all its hospitals
saying ``abnormalities'' have been detected during testing on some
of the 33 veterans with DU shrapnel in their bodies, Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can Rostker say there's no problem,'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   He also criticized the Pentagon's decision to limit medical
screenings to 300 veterans _ a violation of Army regulations that
require medical exams for soldiers who may have been exposed to
radioactive material.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Fahey, author of a 1998 report on the battlefield hazards of
depleted uranium, accused the Pentagon of downplaying the health
risks associated with DU and exaggerating the ammunition's
effectiveness _ a strategy designed to keep the ammo in its weapons
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the benefits of using depleted uranium in battle
vastly outweigh the risk of exposures.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sentence perfectly captures the Pentagon's perspective,''
Fahey said. ``The operational benefit is what's most important _
not the health risks.''

 By CHARLES BERMANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter Malick has been playing blues guitar and recording since
the 1960s. He started out as a member of the psychedelic-era band
Listening, then carved out a larger reputation as lead guitarist
for the James Montgomery Band. He sank into heroin addiction in the
1980s; during his recovery, he discovered computers and the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Today the Web has given Malick's music a worldwide reach and has
injected new life into his career. Malick, who lives in Brookline,
Mass., put up his Web site in 1997 and now plays the Internet like
a vintage guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to his site first see a rapid series of posed pictures
of Malick. From there, visitors can read about his band, find
performance dates or hear parts of _ and order _ his new album,
``Wrong Side of My Life,'' released in March (www.malick.com).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet gives you a way to reach your audience,'' Malick
said. ``It's a natural process and represents the future of how
music will be marketed.''
</P>
<P>
   For musicians, playing has never been enough. In the 1960s, wild
clothes and a political pose were required. In the 1980s, every
band needed a video to get noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Today, because searching the Web has become a standard way for
music lovers to learn about a particular performer or group, the
modern performer must venture on line, presenting a Web page that
acts as an adjunct to the music.
</P>
<P>
   Independent or unsigned performers like Malick have the same
access to online fans as any Top 10 act because labor represents
much of the cost of developing a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Musicians often build pages that include sound, video clips,
biographical information, photographs, tour dates and press
releases. Unlike more costly videos, Web pages can substantially
increase performers' fortunes by providing round-the-clock
information for fans as well as a way to streamline the business of
booking appearances and communicating with the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had this in the 1970s when I first started playing, my
life would be completely different,'' said Diana Quinn, a
Washington singer who belongs to four bands and publicizes them
from a single Web site (www.muddypaws.com). ``Back then, the only
fans we had were local. Now I get mail from places like Japan or
the Orkney Islands, from people who want to buy our CD as soon as
it's available.''
</P>
<P>
   A producer for CBS Radio in Washington, Ms. Quinn has played
local clubs since the 1970s and was recently honored with a local
music award, a Wammie for rock/pop vocalist. Her page gives space
to her four performing outlets: a country combo, a rockabilly
revival group, a rock band and a girl-group revue.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing she no longer features on her site is a phone
number. ``Fans were calling at weird hours and wanted to talk,''
she said. So technology becomes a buffer: she can get closer to her
fans but still keep them at a safe distance.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Wiseman, a Toronto musician, has also used the Internet to
build his fan base around the world. A fan in Italy, for instance,
got one of his records and then searched the Web for more
information. Wiseman's page (www.bobwiseman.ca) came up, and the
two began an e-mail correspondence. That resulted in a visit by
Wiseman to Italy on his next European tour.
</P>
<P>
   Wiseman thinks of the Internet as an equalizer that allows
musicians to circumvent what he called the ``classist'' music
business, where radio stations control what people hear. ``The
Internet short-circuits the class sytem and makes the music
available to anyone,'' he said. ``So people can get the music they
want without serving a lot of larger interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Musicians may need to learn part of a new language. ``The trick
is to gain prominence in search engines so people can find you,''
Malick said. Ms. Quinn has learned how to use HTML programming and
has created her own pages from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, a fan creates a page as an homage to the artist
and the page becomes the official unofficial site. Wiseman's page
was created by a fan, Rob Goodwin, whom he met backstage in 1996.
Goodwin floated the idea of a page and offered to create it
``essentially for free, as long as there weren't any deadlines,''
he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin said he spent several hundred hours creating the site
but now took only a few minutes a week to update it. He said his
only goal was to look professional and consequently generate
interest in Wiseman's music. ``Looking at a Web page, you can't
really tell how big an artist's audience may be,'' he said. ``It
can make you look bigger than you actually are.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Aunt Spiker, an Illinois ska band, the Web made
it look bigger _ literally. At first glance, the Aunt Spiker home
page (www.angelfire.com/il/auntspiker) appears to be a standard
music site, offering pictures, lyrics and information. Closer
inspection reveals that the band is a quartet of ninth graders
whose songs have lyrics like, ``I hate my school, I hate these
teachers, I hate this room.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we'd start small,'' said Jon Buckiewicz, 14, a
guitarist. ``But people have already seen our page and sent us
e-mail. And we've gotten some gigs as a result.'' Interest will
increase, he said, as soon as the band is able to place audio clips
on line.
</P>
<P>
   If putting a band page on line is a computer game, the high
score comes from a getting a contract from a major record label.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first went on line five years ago, the technology was
incapable of delivering a high degree of entertaining content,''
said Todd Steinman, director of new media at Reprise Records in
Burbank, Calif. ``Now it is the technology that is dragging us
along and keeps opening up opportunities and offering new avenues
for communication.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinman said the Internet caused interest in a particular
artist to snowball, resulting in small pockets of fans throughout
the country who create a groundswell of support. ``The Internet
generates a grass-roots following that you can't get from any other
medium,'' he said. ``It used to be that word-of-mouth was a
sixth-grade kid telling all his friends about a great new band.
Today, they just log on and send messages to a huge distribution
list.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the labels may observe a new band's Web presence, the
signing process is still done the old-fashioned way _ with demo
tapes sent through the mail. &QL;

GALANGAL ADDS ZING TO SOUPS, CURRIES AND FISH

<TEXT>
<P>
   ABCs: Galangal (''Alpinia galanga)'' is a Thai perennial, a pale
yellow rhizome that resembles a striped ginger root. It has an
earthy, lemony, peppery taste similar to ginger, the fibrous
texture of which it also resembles.
</P>
<P>
   Growing conditions: Plant by division in late spring. Place a
small plant in a 2- to 3-gallon pot. Galangal can be planted
without rooting it first; put it in well-drained soil. Harvest by
slicing a piece the size of a quarter from a side root beneath the
soil.
</P>
<P>
   Food pairings: Thai soups and curries, Asian fish.

<TEXT>
<P>
   You can find people on the Web who collect just about anything.
Stamps, dolls, shot glasses, you name it.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are those who eschew things in favor of stories. They
tap the Web's reach to gather personal anecdotes on some aspect of
modern life, large or small. Have a Jewish grandma story? Submit
it. What about that failed romance? Enter here. And didn't you used
to do something weird to your Barbie doll? Type it in.
</P>
<P>
   The Net, of course, is a sea of stories. From newsgroups to home
pages, it's hard to escape the outpouring of personal trivia. What
makes the anecdote collectors different is the overlay of
organization, the specific exhortation (``Tell me about THIS!''),
the benefits of seeing stories about the same thing all in the same
place. Such factors may well be what makes them something more than
trivial.
</P>
<P>
   ``These sites can be thought of as one way to gauge what is
going on culturally at a certain moment,'' said Karen Cerulo, an
associate professor of sociology at Rutgers University in New
Brunswick, N.J., who tracks sociological issues in cyberspace.
``Especially when saved into databanks, a time-capsule effect is
created. The stories become historical artifacts to be mined.''
</P>
<P>
   Maura Johnston was simply looking for an outlet for some
autobiographical ``quasiromantic snippets,'' as she called them, of
her own writing. The result was bittersweets.org, which collects
stories of past _ read: failed _ romance. Every day, a new story is
posted on the main page, while older ones are archived. Anyone
interested in the state of love pre-Y2K (at least among the
Net-savvy 20-somethings who seem drawn to this site) should pay a
visit  &UR; (www.bittersweets.org) &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this would be a neat way to get these stories out
there in a way that would be compelling and at the same time
inspire other people to share,'' Ms. Johnston said. ``Hollywood and
Harlequin both understand the appeal of romance. This site puts a
different spin on that, showing people just how strange and sad and
downright awkward it can be.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that she was inspired by a site with a somewhat less
definable focus called lowbrow.com that uses a database to reveal a
new user-submitted ``moment'' each time the page is reloaded and by
another, kvetch.com, that automatically stores and displays
complaints and other cranky outbursts.
</P>
<P>
   Examples of other anecdote collectors that are more specific but
less technologically sophisticated include The Waiter's Revenge
 &UR; (www.geocities.com/soho/1227/now.htm) &LR; , which seeks stories by and
about table servers; When Winners Work for Losers
 &UR; (www.myboss.com) &LR; , which collects humorous workplace anecdotes,
and the aptly named All Things Barbie
 &UR; (www.txdirect.net/sassyfem/barbie.html) &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The Barbie site started as an exchange of e-mail messages among
friends sharing Barbie stories and has become a cache of more than
150 tales of use _ and misuse _ of America's favorite doll. Some
common themes of Barbie handling have emerged on the site: giving
Barbie haircuts, popping the heads off and throwing Barbie from
high places.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Bubbe's Back Porch  &UR; (www.bubbe.com) &LR;  began life
modestly as an interactive family album created for an art gallery
by Abbe Don, an interface designer. She said that wherever the
album was shown ``it acted as a catalyst for people to tell me
their own family stories,'' mostly other women of Jewish
background. Eventually, she built a Web site to make it easier to
collect those stories _ which now number 200 _ with another 200
waiting to be posted.
</P>
<P>
   Collectors also take stories that would otherwise be isolated on
personal home pages and bring them to a potentially broader
audience. Ms. Johnston, for example, sees bitter-sweets.org as a
chance to lead people to those home pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where possible,'' she said, ``I want names and, in most cases,
URL's to be linked to the stories so readers can learn more about
the contributors.''

<P>
   Call it phone-line meltdown, if you will; consumers know it
well. It's that angina-inducing moment when an avalanche of both
voice and data transmission needs threaten to turn your single,
humble phone line, as well as your patience, into a pile of ashes.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to stay in touch with the office _ 20 calls a day _ as
well as surf the Net? Good luck. Plain-vanilla phone lines can do
only so much.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year in particular, consumers have been given a
growing array of options for meeting their escalating need to fax,
phone, send e-mail and go out on the Internet. As a result, they no
longer have to rely on just a phone line or two.
</P>
<P>
   But many of these newer transmission options, like cable
Internet connections and ADSL (asymmetrical digital subscriber
lines), are currently available only in certain parts of the
country. And while their prices are dropping, they are, for the
most part, still expensive, with not just higher service costs but
also extra charges for special modems, installation and even
Internet service providers. Even then, technical support for the
services is often less than encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   Given the constraints of newer technologies, many consumers are
sticking with the tried and true. That usually means simply
increasing the number of regular phone lines, from one or two to
three or four _ or more. By all accounts, sales of regular phone
lines are booming. An extra line is usually no more than $20 a
month, with installation starting around $75.
</P>
<P>
   In California, for example, Pacific Bell has installed a record
number of telephone access lines in the past three financial
quarters, and almost all of those installations have been standard
phone lines, which use analog technology. Pacific Bell now offers
its customers 17.7 million access lines. But it still has only
about 170,000 customers for its ISDN (integrated services digital
network) service. The company is now introducing ADSL service as
well.
</P>
<P>
   At Bell Atlantic, sales of extra analog lines are also brisk.
The number of sales first surged in 1994 and is now growing by 15
percent a year, said Debra Swann, executive director for consumer
local and toll services at Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Families with talk-happy teen-agers, as well as home offices,
account for a good chunk of the interest, of course. At Pacific
Bell, for example, about one-sixth of the requests for extra phone
lines are now coming from families that plan to give the lines to
teen-agers, said John Britton, a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Still, heavy Internet use seems to be the factor that eventually
drives most consumers to pile up dial tones. For example, in a
survey of 7,800 households last fall, Ziff-Davis Marketing
Intelligence found that 51 percent of those that used the Internet
16 hours or more a week had two or more lines, while 8 percent had
three or more.
</P>
<P>
   At Byte Sized Computing, a home-office consulting business in
Rye, N.Y., Dominick Curatola, the owner, said he was asked about
the need for second lines ``almost every day.'' So far, he added,
consumers seem to be sticking with analog technology. ``I think
there's interest in newer technologies on a theoretical level, but
the small office or home hasn't really begun to push it,'' Curatola
said. That's because most people are buying computers that have
modems that use traditional analog phone lines already built into
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite honestly, consumers are having enough time with regular
modems and services, let alone the fancier technologies,'' said Jim
Mulcahy, who owns another computer consulting service, Computer
Tutor (AT)PCI in Bronxville, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   But many consumers may simply not yet need the lightning-fast
transmission speeds of newer technologies like ADSL. At its
fastest, ADSL can pummel data along 250 times faster than a
traditional 28.8-Kbps (kilobits per second) modem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The killer application for the Internet is still e-mail,''
said Doug Michelman, another spokesman for Pacific Bell. ``More
often than not, consumers are accessing the Internet for e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Cost, however, may be an equally strong motivator. Take the
McCalmont family of Cincinnati. The McCalmonts already have three
phone lines. Yet until recently, they found themselves juggling
those lines constantly to meet their considerable voice and data
needs.
</P>
<P>
   Both McCalmont and his wife, Alyce, for example, work from home
as professional organizers; as such, they not only need to maintain
a semblance of order at home regarding communications but also need
to rely on open phone lines for business calls and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But the McCalmonts' daughter, Laura, 16, is on the phone
constantly. And their son, Drew, 14, spends so much time on the
Internet _ up to 12 hours a day in the summer _ that he now has his
own phone line.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the McCalmonts realized that they needed to
expand their phone line capacity fast. But they were already paying
almost $200 a month for their three lines, an Internet service
provider and three car phones. As a result, ISDN service was never
an option.
</P>
<P>
   In the Cincinnati area, it costs $110 a month for service alone,
while installation, an ISDN modem and Internet service cost extra.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the McCalmonts could have installed a fourth phone
line, at a service cost of about $20 a month. Three months ago,
however, they opted for an even cheaper, as well as simpler,
solution: an Internet call manager service from Cincinnati Bell.
For $7 a month, the service lets them answer or transfer an
incoming call while they are using the Internet on their business
line. They can also flash callers a message to let them know they
will return the call.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Jon Kiphart is also staying true to his analog phone lines. As a
freelance programmer who, among other things, automates theme park
rides, Kiphart often finds himself connecting to the Internet from
phones in far-flung locales like Malaysia that are not equipped to
send and receive data on line and that also have limited access to
digital phone technology.
</P>
<P>
   For times like these, Kiphart carries his own acoustical modem,
a coupling device designed for phones. At home, in
Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y., he makes do with two analog phone lines,
even though he often has to download large files chock full of
graphics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard that ISDN modems are very difficult to set up,'' he
said. ``And what I need is ease of use, durability and reliability,
as well as the ability to tap into my computer from exotic
locations.''
</P>
<P>
   Cost, however, is also a sticking point for Kiphart. ``If the
local cable service were able to deliver Internet service for $20 a
month, I'd go for it,'' he said. ``I'd also be willing to pay $30 a
month for unlimited ISDN access. But right now I'm already spending
between $200 and $300 a month for two analog lines, Internet
service, a cell phone and a pager.''
</P>
<P>
   Digital technologies are becoming more affordable. For example,
computer manufacturers are expected to roll out products that have
ADSL modems built into them as early as next year. Meanwhile, ADSL
technology, unlike ISDN, carries the advantage of not being
metered, so consumers can usually get unlimited service for between
$70 and $90 a month. That fee, however, doesn't cover ADSL's hefty
installation and modem costs, which can chalk up an extra $600 or
more.
</P>
<P>
   Phone companies are trying to keep connection costs down as
well. For example, when Bell Atlantic begins rolling out ADSL
service next month, start-up fees will be held to less than $200
for an introductory promotional period. That fee will include a $99
connection fee and an ADSL modem for less than $100.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic says it will also waive fees for any home wiring
work that may be necessary and any setup help that customers may
need to reconfigure their computers for the new technology.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Castleton, director of data products for Bell Atlantic,
says consumer interest in the company's ADSL service has been
overwhelming so far. ``There seems to be pent-up demand for it,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for now, many consumers seem to be sticking with the
technology that gives them the fewest number of headaches. One
example is Beth Rowan, a public relations and marketing consultant
who lives in Bronxville, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rowan works from her home and has two teen-agers, ages 13
and 16. Not surprisingly, she likes ``to have things simple and
straightforward, rather than the latest technology on the block.''
As a result, when she needed more phone capacity last summer, she
simply installed a third phone line.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rowan may move to a faster transmission technology yet: she
says she is tired of the ``antiquated'' phone system in her county
that allows her to surf the Net at a speed of only about 28 Kpbs,
even though she has a 56-Kbps modem. For now, though, she is
sticking with the simplest solution possible.
</P>
<P>
   So is Elizabeth Wise, a psychology student in Bronxville. Ms.
Wise does a lot of Web surfing, and her husband, a financial
analyst, often has to use one of the family's two phone lines to
transmit lengthy reports to the computer at his office in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Ms. Wise's home was wired for ISDN technology in a
recent renovation, she is sticking with analog phone lines for now
because of cost and because she knows that newer transmission
technologies, like cable and satellite, will be coming along.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm waiting to see how these other technologies are going to
shake down,'' she said. ``I want what is simplest, as well as most
economical, for the home user. And when I get it, I'll stick with
it.''

   Mary Jane McGraw of North Richland Hills, Texas, has a recipe
calling for a No. 1 can of crushed pineapple and needs to know what
size that is.
</P>
<P>
   When cans didn't vary as much in size as they do now, recipes
often identified sizes with a simple number. The No. 1 size is an
11-ounce can or 1 1/3 cups. If you run into the same problem, there
is a conversion chart in the back of the older editions of ``Joy of
Cooking.'' The newest edition, published last year, does not
include the chart.
</P>
<P>
   Never too late: Rachel Flanders of Granbury, Texas, recalls that
several years ago a reader requested a recipe for chili bean salad.
Here's that recipe.

GARDENING QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

<P>
   &UR; Cicada Killers &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am having an insect problem in my backyard every August. I
believe the insects are called cicada-eating bees; they are long in
shape, with powerful jaws that dig big holes to dig out the
cicadas. They do not attack people. We have big blocks of concrete
with dirt between, which is where the insects dig holes. We are
mystified about how to handle the problem and would be grateful for
your suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   A. They are big, they are ugly, they look threatening, but
mostly they are harmless. These one-and-a-quarter-inch-long wasps,
called cicada killers, give their young a good start in life by
paralyzing cicadas with their stings and burying one with each egg.
The wasps are easily identifiable by their yellow abdominal
markings, rust-colored head and thorax, and amber-yellow wings.
Females can sting, but normally have to be provoked. Males do not
sting but are aggressive and territorial.
</P>
<P>
   These wasps prefer bare soil, sandy areas or lawns, where they
dig deep burrows three or four feet long, leaving small side
chambers along the way for eggs. When the eggs hatch, the larvae
feed on the cicadas, spin a cocoon and overwinter. The adults
emerge in July and August and repeat the cycle, annoying homeowners
and golfers. (Sand traps are a common nesting area.)
</P>
<P>
   Since they are around for a only a month or so, live and let
live is the best policy. If they have really outworn their welcome,
a layer of metal window screening buried an inch or two below the
surface between the rocks will discourage them, but they may just
find another spot nearby.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Yes, We Have No Berries &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Three years ago, I planted a doublefile viburnum, partly
because the shape of the mature viburnum has a lovely Oriental
appearance. But the main reason for planting it was to provide
berries in fall and winter for birds that opt to remain in cooler
climates. Bottom line: three years have gone by and no berries yet.
What's up?
</P>
<P>
   A. One of the country's leading experts on woody plants,
Professor Michael Dirr of the University of Georgia in Athens, said
there are several possibilities but no easy way to know which one
is right. If you have Viburnum plicatum, variety tomentosum, and it
didn't flower, it may not be quite old enough. (If it is less than
three feet tall, it's probably too young.) But if you bought a
named cultivar, like Summer Snowflake (which is known for its heavy
fruiting), age is not the problem, since named cultivars are cloned
from mature tissue.
</P>
<P>
   If your viburnum bloomed but did not set fruit well, it will do
better with a companion. Another clone nearby shouldn't really be
necessary, but most doublefile viburnums seem to set more fruit if
cross-pollinated.
</P>
<P>
   Or it may still be getting over being transplanted, in which
case another growing season should solve the problem. Unless, of
course, you have been pampering it with lots of water and
fertilizer. Excess nitrogen simply promotes foliage growth at the
expense of flowers.
</P>
<P>
   If the problem isn't age, loneliness, transplant shock or too
much fertilizer, it could be lack of light. Some viburnums will
usually set fruit even in light shade, but they do better with more
sun. Of course, moving it means two to three years of waiting for
recovery, but gardeners are supposed to take a long view of things.
It will bloom and set fruit, and the birds will thank you.
Doublefile viburnums must be especially tasty, because the birds
strip the berries right away, even before they have completely
ripened. Others, including Viburnum dilatatum (look for the
selections Iroquois, Erie or Asian Beauty) and Viburnum x
rhytidophylloides, selections Alleghany or Willow Wood, hold on to
their fruit well into winter.

PROGRAMMING LESSONS FOR PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: The (AT) word should be replaced with the symbol)  
 (af)  
 By KAREN FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The concepts behind programming computers, like binary logic and
positive and negative feedback loops, sound like mind-twisters to
most adults. But a new toy is designed to let children figure out
such concepts on their own, minus the jargon, as they build burglar
alarms and lighthouses.
</P>
<P>
   The toy, called Logiblocs, was introduced in November 1996 and
is being used in about 2,000 British primary schools, said Tony de
Rivaz, the company's managing director.
</P>
<P>
   The company just started offering Logiblocs, intended for
children 4 to 14, through an e-mail address,
sales(AT)logiblocs.com, and plans to have a Web site by September.
The prices of home sets range from $20 to $65. A standard school
set, which has more blocks, costs $210 to $290.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put the blocks together, it's a bit like lower-level
and higher-level programming,'' said de Rivaz, who is an engineer.
``They're learning cause and effect. When you join things together,
it makes things happen, like light-beam alarms and switching motors
on and off.''
</P>
<P>
   The blocks, which are battery powered, are joined to create
circuits, but the circuits quickly become complicated. Some blocks
carry the signal in one or more directions, some block the signal
or send it in another direction and some are sensitive to things
like light or touch.
</P>
<P>
   So if light to a certain block is cut off _ by a prying parent
daring to enter a child's room, for example, and stepping over the
block _ that bit of negative feedback can be translated into an
alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Lynas, deputy head of the Marsh First School in High
Wycombe, England, said 6-year-olds had been using Logiblocs there
for a year, building things like metal detectors and alarms. ``The
children are actually understanding the binary system, but they
don't know they are,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many children at High Wycombe, a government-supported school,
live in low-income areas, Ms. Lynas said. ``They don't have
computers in the home, so this is a lovely way to get them
started,'' she said. The school's parents association raised the
money to buy the Logiblocs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children call the orange blocks the brains,'' she said.
``And they call the block with a smiley face the teacher. It's like
the teacher's smiley face, and it switches everything off after
eight seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Such early exposure to sophisticated design concepts can make
children comfortable with technology, said Dr. Amy S. Bruckman, an
assistant professor of computing at the Georgia Institute of
Technology who developed Moose Crossing, an Internet community for
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids develop a fluency with technology when they see it as a
medium they can use expressively to do things that are of value to
them,'' Dr. Bruckman said. While it would not be good to push a
child too fast, she said, ``I don't see any risk in giving them a
sophisticated learning tool in a play situation.''
</P>
<P>
   After children learn to use Logiblocs, de Rivaz said, they find
ways to make their designs more sophisticated, much as a computer
programmer starts polishing code, looking for elegance, after
figuring out how to make something work.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll use 20 to 25 blocks to do something, then start taking
things out, asking if they can make it do the same thing more
efficiently,'' he said. ``They'll wind up with half or a third of
the blocks they started with. It's an empirical process of
design.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a design is assembled, it takes on a life of its own, de
Rivaz said. ``It'll carry on without anybody pressing buttons, and
children find that fascinating,'' he said. ``The first time they
put something like that together, they sort of jump back.''

N2O: AT ITS BEST AT HIGH VOLUME IN THE DARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you threw rave culture in a blender, liquefied it and smeared
the frappe of ones and zeroes onto the surface of a CD-ROM, the
result would bear a strong resemblance to N2O, a cyberdelic space
shooter for the Sony Playstation (Fox Interactive, $44.98).
</P>
<P>
   For those old enough to remember Tempest, an '80s arcade game
where you skittered around the circumference of a vortex zapping
oncoming space insects, N2O will be instantly familiar.
</P>
<P>
   The game play is identical. But whereas Tempest employed
two-dimensional vector graphics and sporadic sound effects, N2O
takes place in a three-dimensional tube of pulsing color with
ripples of ambient sound and music by the Crystal Method, America's
reigning champs of knob-twiddling electronica.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, N2O is Tempest on Ecstasy, acid, speed and a
number of other controlled substances. It looks exactly the way
techno music sounds, and it begs to be played at high volume in the
dark.
</P>
<P>
   Like any decent space shooter, this one takes place ``somewhere
deep in the future'' in a galaxy at war. According to the back
story, ``On the nearby planet of Neptune, forces of evil have
initiated their new plans to invade the Earth. By accelerating
subatomic particles around a tubular circuit known as the Torus,
they are developing a race of Super Warriors. Together with
advanced genetic engineering, this central birthing canal is
capable of producing an army of lethal, genetically mutated
insects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nitrous oxide, a pollutant byproduct emitted inside the Torus,
provides a high-octane fuel for your Tunnel Runner, but
unfortunately it also provides the perfect breeding environment for
the secretly incubating species. Your mission: Set a course for
Neptune. Fly your Tunnel Runner into the nitrous oxide-filled
tubes. Destroy the Super Warriors and genetic mutations before they
are strong enough to invade Earth. Come home for milk and
cookies.''
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 30 levels in this game. Some twist and turn
maniacally. Some contract and expand. Some climb and then drop
vertiginously with no warning, while others split open or have
undulating walls that drag your spaceship in various directions.
</P>
<P>
   And throughout, you are in a constant state of acceleration
because every time you kill an enemy, it emits a concentrated burst
of the same nitrous oxide (wink wink, nudge nudge) that fuels your
vehicle. The more space insects you blow up, the faster you go. By
the end of any given level, you are zooming ahead at
incomprehensible speeds through a synesthetic vortex of sound and
light. Freudian considerations aside, it's a thrilling experience.
</P>
<P>
   In bonus rounds, the acceleration factor is squared. So at a
certain point, you are actually moving faster than some of your own
projectiles. You throw out a wall of flame and a few minutes later,
you fly through it. You're outrunning your own bullets.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the only strategy against obstacles is avoidance.
Firing lasers doesn't help. Hurtling forward, you have only one way
to protect yourself: you can move out of the way. If you balk, if
you try to slow down, if you blink, you die.
</P>
<P>
   To survive, you have to make your peace with velocity. When
acceleration becomes second nature, you find your balance again.
You find a different way of concentrating, and you groove to it.
Once you get past the shock, in that state of hypervelocity,
there's a kind of calm.
</P>
<P>
   That's the technological sublimity in a nutshell: beauty and
terror and speed (involuntary speed) and acceleration and
information (digital information) and spectacle. That's why the
game code fuses so seamlessly with the soundtrack. They're about
the same things.
</P>
<P>
   If you go to a Crystal Method concert (the band's forthcoming
tour is sponsored by Fox Interactive, the game's publisher), you'll
see something that looks a lot like N2O. Between the sequencers and
samplers on stage and the computerized lighting effects, you're
subject to the same kind of digitally triggered overload.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our favorite thing is when we do a really big show and we rent
a whole wall of data flashers, these strobes, and it's just this
blinding wall of strobe lights that come on _ it's a really amazing
effect,'' said Ken Jordan, half of the Method's deejay-composer
duo. ``We definitely go for intensity. We're not interested in
making our shows look like reality. We're interested in making the
most intense and dynamic experience you've ever been through.''
</P>
<P>
   In concert, the Method delivers that experience to a thousand
people simultaneously, using an arsenal of equipment. On the
soundtrack to N2O, it delivers the same experience to one or two
players using a $150 consumer electronics device.
</P>
<P>
   The band also delivers a full-length album _ the N2O soundtrack
has eight tracks from the Crystal Method's ``Vegas'' CD, and a
couple of rare remixes. At a time when most record companies are
failing miserably in their attempts to spice up audio recordings
with digital content, N2O takes the concept of an enhanced CD out
of the doldrums (Web sites, electronic liner notes) and into warp
speed.
</P>
<P>
   From an audio standpoint, it makes infinitely more sense. Music
CDs with PC content on them play through standard dinky computer
speakers. N2O can be channeled through the gut-rocking sonic array
of a home theater. Even low-end televisions deliver better sound
than most computers.
</P>
<P>
   When you consider that North America's 10 million Playstation
owners are the same teen-agers and 20-somethings who rabidly
consume new CDs, it's not clear that a Windows desktop is the best
showcase for digitally enhanced pop music. Game consoles are
mass-produced computers whose sole function is to pump out graphics
and sound. They're accessible. They're easy to use. And no one's
Playstation is going to implode in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few thoughts from the vortex of exploding space insects.
</P>
<P>
   Rave on.

<P>
   A roof with slate tiles can last for years without much
maintenance but, occasionally, individual tiles may deteriorate
with age or they may be damaged by falling debris from a nearby
tree. Tiles can also work loose and fall out when buffeted by high
winds. Tiles that are not exposed to the sun may grow moss.
</P>
<P>
   Repairing and replacing slate-roofing tiles is not difficult,
but it can be dangerous because slate tiles are slippery and slate
roofs are often steep. Also walking on a slate roof can crack or
damage the existing, good tiles. For these reasons, it is best to
leave major repairs to a professional and confine your repair work
to those jobs that can be done near the edge of the roof from an
extension ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Choose a mild day to do the work. Of course, you will have to
erect an extension ladder to get at the roof. When working, it is
important to observe a few basic safety precautions. The distance
between the wall and the base of the ladder should be at least
one-quarter of the ladder's working height. Raise the ladder so the
top is about three feet above the edge of the roof.
</P>
<P>
   When climbing up, face the ladder and use two hands to grip the
rungs. Never attempt to carry tools or supplies in your hands as
you are climbing. Instead, wear a work belt and clip the tools to
it. Place your supplies in a bucket and tie a long rope to the
handle. Once you are in position on the ladder, you can pull your
supplies up.
</P>
<P>
   Moss growth on tiles can be eliminated with common weed killer.
Use a garden sprayer to apply the weed killer and a stiff-bristled
brush to rub off the moss.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever you find damaged tiles, you must first remove them
before you can insert a replacement. If the holding nails have
rusted away, you may be able to slide the broken tile out without
too much trouble. Otherwise you will have to cut the nails. For
this you will need a tool called a slater's ripper (also called a
shingle nail remover).
</P>
<P>
   The slater's ripper is a flat metal bar with two sharpened hooks
on one end, and a handle on the other. Slip the ripper under the
damaged tile and move it about to the left and right until one of
the hooks catches a nail. Pull down on the handle to cut the nail.
If you need more force to slice through the nail, rap the handle
with a hammer.
</P>
<P>
   You can also use a hacksaw blade to cut holding nails. Wrap one
end of the blade with heavy-duty tape _ this will serve as a handle
_ slip the other end under the tile. When you contact a nail, move
the blade up and down to cut it. Remember each tile is held in
place with two nails.
</P>
<P>
   Take a piece of the broken tile with you when you purchase a
replacement. You can use it find a match of similar color and
thickness, but you probably will not be able to find a tile with
the same length and width. In this case you will have to cut one to
size.
</P>
<P>
   You can rent a slate cutter. You can also use a bricklayer's
trowel to resize tiles. Place the tile on a flat work table with
the amount to be removed projecting beyond the edge of the table.
Use the edge of the trowel to chop off the projecting piece.
</P>
<P>
   Another method for cutting tiles is with a nail set. Use it to
punch a series of small holes along a scored cutting line. You can
then break the tile along this perforated line by pressing it
against the edge of a table.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional way to hold the replacement tile in place is
with a thin strip of metal (preferably of copper or zinc). Cut a
piece one inch wide and about eight inches long. Place the metal
strip in position where the new tile will sit. Secure it by driving
a nail into the roof. The nail must go in the gap between the slate
tiles already on the roof. Slide the new tile in place. The end of
the metal strip will project beyond its bottom edge. Bend the strip
up to form a hook and hold the tile in place.

   LAREDO, Texas _ Adriana Perez's body was found under a mesquite
tree with a Bible shoved under the T-shirt she had worn.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Cordero, 16, was last seen in mid-July, running through
the brush as a U.S. Border Patrol helicopter hovered over him and
several more people who had crossed the Rio Grande illegally.
</P>
<P>
   No one has heard from him since, and his hysterical mother fears
the baby of a family from the Mexican state of Guerrero is dead
somewhere in southern Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Marlon Tambito was luckier. After being left behind by fellow
travelers because the cramps in his legs slowed him down, he
stumbled out of the brush and was given water by Border Patrol
agents.
</P>
<P>
   Folder after folder at the Mexican consulate in Laredo contains
birth certificates from small towns across Mexico, accompanied by
death certificates issued by Webb County for young Mexican adults.
</P>
<P>
   This parched stretch of the border has become one of the killing
fields for illegal immigrants who risk crossing the Rio Grande to
get into the United States, some of them falling victim to
dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truthfully, we are worried and scared for our young people,''
said Luis Ramirez, Mexico's consul in Laredo. ``This year has been
particularly hot.''
</P>
<P>
   As portions of Texas ride out a drought and the brutal heat wave
that has claimed the lives of at least 47 undocumented immigrants
since May 1, U.S. and Mexican officials have mounted Operation
Lifesaver.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative has enlisted Spanish-language public service
announcements on Mexican radio and television to warn potential
immigrants about the dangers of extreme heat.
</P>
<P>
   Border Patrol agents have been deployed with special first aid
kits and extra jugs of water to help distressed crossers who,
despite the death toll, keep sneaking into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know people die. It's factual, historical and a part of
these people's lives,'' said George Gunnoe, an assistant chief with
the Border Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Husbands, brothers and children are being left out there. They
come from the interior of Mexico to look for a life and die for
lack of water,'' Gunnoe said at the headquarters for the patrol's
Laredo sector.
</P>
<P>
   As a patrol helicopter hovered overhead on a late July
afternoon, its rotors blew dust onto more than two dozen dazed and
thirsty men, and one woman.
</P>
<P>
   They hugged the ground and tried to hide among the cactus. The
day was torrid, the temperature 105 degrees, and their hike through
some of the most rugged and deadly terrain in South Texas was over,
at least for that afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Agents quickly rounded up the 27 people and got them out of the
heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to Dallas to look for a life,'' Cerilo Garcia, 24,
said as he clutched a plastic jug of water handed to him by a
Border Patrol agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fresh water from the United States, the United States that
doesn't want us,'' said Garcia, who was soaked in sweat and wore
rosary beads around his neck. ``In Mexico, the people are dying of
hunger.''
</P>
<P>
   As Garcia gulped water, others traveling with him had blank
stares of exhaustion and desperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smuggling routes used to be along fence posts and paths. Now
they're making it more difficult for us,'' said Border Patrol agent
Chris Cantu, who was part of a team that had tracked the group for
hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on what route they take, they could really be in
danger of dehydration,'' Cantu said.
</P>
<P>
   As the men were loaded into patrol vehicles, they already were
talking of how they would again try to sneak back into the United
States and defy death.
</P>
<P>
   In Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, just across the Rio Grande, a run-down
hotel with cement walls and dirty rooms is packed with stern-faced
young men making a last stop before taking their shot at the
American dream.
</P>
<P>
   The downtown hotel, less than a block from the river, is a
staging ground for those making their way illegally into the United
States: a place where guides known as ``coyotes'' are hired and
travelers gather courage before wading the river and making their
covert treks into Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Oil company pipelines as well as ranch fences and powerlines
guide them north where they often hitchhike or meet smugglers who
take them deeper into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But before they reach their rides, they must cross seemingly
endless miles of ranchland full of cactus and rattlesnakes.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the men at the hotel can recount horror stories of
people who have been overwhelmed by the sun and left to die, or
swept away by the river's tricky currents or disappeared and never
heard from again.
</P>
<P>
   A sun-bleached skull was spotted on a ranch near Laredo
recently. The authorities say they believe the remains are of an
undocumented immigrant who died in the heat last summer, but they
concede there's no way to know what really happened or how to
notify the person's family.
</P>
<P>
   ``They probably think he's lost or working here and hasn't
called back,'' said Alberto Pena, a Webb County sheriff's
investigator.
</P>

   Adriana Perez's family was somewhat luckier. Authorities were
able to identify her body and notify her family of her fate when
they found a Mexican voter registration card in the Bible stuffed
under the T-shirt she wore when her body was found in June.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who vanished was Alberto Cordero, who was last seen
scrambling to hide from a Border Patrol helicopter circling
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Ezequiel Perez, Cordero's cousin, was with him at the time.
Perez, 21, recalled how they and two companions had crossed the
river around midnight and followed power lines heading north before
taking refuge near a watering hole.
</P>
<P>
   A short while later, the helicopter swooped over them, and
everyone split up to hide. The only person who wasn't apprehended
was Cordero.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone ran from the helicopter,'' Perez recalled quietly as
he sat in the hotel in Nuevo Laredo, preparing for another attempt
to get across the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where he could be. It was our first time in the
United States,'' Perez said.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Eschbach, a sociology professor at the University of
Houston, who studies immigration and the U.S.-Mexico border, said
this summer is the worst in at least a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has always been a certain amount of death crossing the
Rio Grande and walking through South Texas,'' Eschbach said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really is a historical year in terms of dehydration
deaths,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that undocumented immigrants underestimate how
far they'll have to walk to sneak past Border Patrol agents, and a
lingering drought has dried up watering holes that have been used
for generations.
</P>
<P>
   The heat and untested crossing areas have left immigrants so
disoriented that ranch hands have found them hiking in circles or
heading south instead of north.
</P>
<P>
   And Ramirez, Mexico's consul in Laredo, said his country's young
people will continue to sneak into the United States as long as
they can find work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will never find a Mexican begging for money in this
country. They only want work.''

`COYOTES' PREY ON COVERT BUSINESS OF CROSSING THE BORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico _ They roam the bus stations, parks and
budget hotels of border cities looking to make cash by sneaking
people into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Smugglers whose goods are humans long have been the covert
conductors for underground railroads through South Texas and other
stretches of the U.S.-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   Known on the streets as ``coyotes,'' ``polleros'' or
``pateros,'' they have been the subject of songs and poems.
</P>
<P>
   They are seen by many Mexicans as guides who can outsmart the
U.S. Border Patrol and sneak them through a maze of hot brushland,
highway checkpoints, roving patrols and helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   But across the Rio Grande in the United States, law enforcement
officials brand the smugglers as ruthless criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The Border Patrol accuses them of leaving people to die in the
brush, robbing them at gunpoint and locking them in freight cars
and trucks that turn into ovens in the brutal heat of summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The figure of the coyote is almost mythical along the
border,'' said David Spener, an assistant professor at Trinity
University in San Antonio who has just launched his study of the
smuggling of humans across the Texas-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   As the Border Patrol beefs up efforts to control crossings into
South Texas, the need for coyotes likely will increase, Spener
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people will portray them as the scum of the earth, but
everyone that comes here seems to need their services,'' Spener
said during a recent trip along both sides of the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   He's loosely affiliated with a group of researchers examining
the trafficking of humans in other areas, including Europe, Asia
and South America.
</P>
<P>
   Rey Garza, an assistant chief for the patrol's McAllen sector,
said coyotes jeopardize the lives of their human cargo. ``We feel
they're the dangerous element of this whole ordeal down here,''
Garza said. ``They have no conception of someone's safety.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, people from the interior of Mexico are guided
across drainage ditches or waterways in Mexican border cities and
told by hired smugglers that they had just crossed the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   But some savvy smugglers, who go all out to ensure people reach
their destinations, are known to use cellular phones, two-way
radios and night-vision equipment to outmaneuver Border Patrol
agents. Some of the coyotes are known to be ruthless, even
inhumane.
</P>
<P>
   In San Antonio in late July, Immigration and Naturalization
Service agents discovered 13 Mexican men sealed inside a truck
trailer being transported on a flatbed railroad car. The men were
dehydrated and told agents they had paid between $300 and $700 to
be smuggled to the Dallas area.
</P>
<P>
   That same week in Brownsville, Border Patrol agents found a
missing 2-year-old boy with a note pinned to his chest. The
toddler, who was found in an apartment complex, apparently had been
abandoned by smugglers trying to extort money from his mother in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   His 6-year-old sister was found at a downtown Brownsville hotel
with about 20 other illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most infamous smuggling-deaths cases happened in June
1987, near Sierra Blanca, when 18 illegal immigrants were found in
a sealed box car that had been turned into an oven by the afternoon
sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a Vietnam veteran, but I had not seen anything as heinous
as I did when I arrived at the scene of that crime,'' said Art
Moreno, a spokesman for the INS who at the time was a television
reporter in El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a horrible day. I can still see the expressions on
their faces and how their bodies were twisted,'' Moreno said.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 report headed by Douglas Massey, a professor at the
University of Pennsylvania, notes that 70 percent of the people
sneaking across the U.S.-Mexico border for the first time use the
help of smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   ``For first-time immigrants, the border looms as a threatening,
dangerous and hostile place,'' the report said. The report said
that with each passing journey across the border, the experience
becomes less daunting.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is a legacy of death.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those that are ruthless, there is no doubt,'' said
Rogelio Nunez, executive director for Proyecto Libertad, an
immigration and civil rights group in Harlingen.
</P>

   ``I would imagine crossing is something people need help with.
If it's your first time, you need a helping hand. Unfortunately,
these are the people doing it,'' he said of the smugglers.

A HOUSE WHERE ROOMS ARE A STATE OF MIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH GIOVANNINI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. _ Trophy houses, those 15,000-square-foot
status symbols, may get all the ink in advertisements and the envy
at cocktail parties, but the houses that are harder to measure and
describe, the unconventional buildings with experimental or
artistic qualities, are often more likely to throw a provocative
curve at life.
</P>
<P>
   Agents can easily show a 5-br prewar Tudor on lush 4 acres w vu
of Snd, but how do they credibly push a house that is not a Jell-O
mold for all-in-the-family living _ a house with, say, crackled
concrete floors, voluminous space and gyroscopic sunlight pouring
through faceted glass onto Stonehenge walls. The kind that is a
catalyst for ideas and a trampoline for dreaming.
</P>
<P>
   These exceptional houses are seldom found in ads; even when a
client works with an architect, it's iffy to expect they can be
built from the ground up.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, after wildfire incinerated the ranch-style house of
Victoria and Richard Blades, along with 500 other houses on a
hillside in Santa Barbara, the couple realized that their disaster
was an opportunity to escape small, boxy rooms. They decided to
look for a house with lofty, undecorated areas _ ``No chandeliers,
please,'' Mrs. Blades said. They wanted to live in a house that was
a work of art, not one with a floor plan calculated for resale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wore out a half-dozen real estate agents,'' said Mr.
Blades, 58, whose work as a conceptual sculptor and metal
fabricator influenced his eye for architecture. Mrs. Blades, 52,
works in a high-tech company, managing a department that develops
CD-ROMs. They have no children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real estate agents wanted to deal with the number of bathrooms
and bedrooms, and the kind of roof style,'' Mr. Blades said. ``We
were looking for volume. For us, the usual tiny family rooms meant
an absurd compartmentalization of space. In most of the places, we
couldn't get back far enough to see art. We tried to tell agents we
were looking for tough, masculine materials.'' Instead of a typical
high-end house, what they really wanted was a New York loft, set in
Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   After many months of looking, the couple chanced to see the
Crawford House in Montecito, a collaged composition of cubic forms
and materials that fuse with the landscape. They found their way to
its architects, the Santa Monica firm Morphosis, to confer with
Thom Mayne about building a similar house on their one-acre lot, a
house that would become a companion for thinking and sculpturing.
The meeting was the start of a sometimes perilous five-year,
hands-on collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   With insurance money and savings, the Bladeses proposed building
a $600,000 home of approximately 4,000 square feet, including pool
and decks, or about $150 a square foot, with one master bedroom, an
upstairs study and a double-height art gallery. (Many
design-intensive houses range between $300 and $400 a square foot.)
</P>
<P>
   Mayne, 53, a member of the next architectural generation in Los
Angeles after Frank Gehry, designs complex buildings energized by
broken and chaotic forms, built of tough but finely crafted
materials. Up front, given the budget, the architect said he told
his clients that ``there would be no marble, no exotic detailing,
that we'd be building in generic materials like concrete and wood
and metal and block _ that the welds would be showing and the
metals would be left rusting and exposed.'' He added: ``It'd be
constructed like a cabin. The value of the house would not be in
the raw materiality but in space and light.''
</P>
<P>
   The budget also meant that the architect's sometimes overfed
designs _ as a young architect he often jammed too many ideas into
too small a building _ would have to diet. Part of the economic
strategy was to eliminate doors and some cabinetry; that decision
in turn increased the sense of openness and emphasized the
roughhouse qualities the couple had sought in a loft.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. and Mrs. Blades had met a soul mate _ though one with his
own esthetic agenda. The house would become a dual story _ of their
search for an architectural house and Mayne's search for
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Mayne was interested in taking his idea for the Crawford House,
a fusion of architecture and landscape, a step further. Instead of
placing a self-contained house on a passive piece of land, like
setting a plate on a table, the architect wanted to cut and burrow
into the earth, shaping the ground as part of the house's form.
</P>
<P>
   His inspiration for using the earth as an architectural element
was the land artist Michael Heiser _ ``He operates on a site by
subtracting, rather than adding,'' Mayne said _ and the early Los
Angeles modernist Richard Neutra, who put humans back into nature
via a house that spread into the yard behind expanses of glass.
Mayne's house would not be sited front and center.
</P>
<P>
   His strategy was to create a large outdoor space with high,
intermittent walls that suggest an oval and then to cut across the
oval with a long thin house under an arching roof. ``It's a
continuous fluid space,'' Mayne said. ``You can see all the way
through for about 100 feet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bladeses had their loft, or at least its California hillside
incarnation. Starting with the kitchen at the lowest level, a big
open space steps up the site, moving to the living room and then to
the bedroom beyond. The long narrow room splits at the bedroom
level, becoming a Y-shape plan. A staircase to Mrs. Blades'
second-story study branches off to the right, alongside a
dynamically tilted and angled wall that seems to be taking off over
an outdoor pool. To the left, the Y branches into the bedroom and
dressing area, where an open shower, with poured-in-place concrete
half-walls recessed in the ground, anchors the space.
</P>
<P>
   The bedroom, study and staircase area is an intense finale,
where all the geometries of the house and site converge and pass
through each other, like traffic at an intersection without a
signal. No single order dominates, but several jockey for position
in a landscape of fragments that marks an ambiguous and intriguing
edge between outside and inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are never any complete geometries, only allusions to
complete geometries _ there are never any wholes,'' Mayne said. ``I
was attacking the notion of a single boundary in a house. I wanted
to create layers of boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   The architect can afford the openness in the bedroom and bath
area because he creates privacy along the street with a long
straight, poker-faced wall that houses the garage, bathroom,
entrance and gallery. The many ``backyard'' windows, which come in
all shapes and are high and low in the structure, need no curtains.
</P>
<P>
   During construction, the couple lent a hand, becoming
subcontractors, fabricating the rails, stairs, parts of a shower
and other metal details. ``After the catastrophe, the whole design
effort and the construction were very motivating,'' Mr. Blades
said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although Mrs. Blades kept her day job, he stopped his sculpture:
the house was taking on a demanding life of its own. Living in an
interim rental, they worked side by side on extended weekends, and
after the work crews left, they could be found in boots browsing
the site as though on a hike. ``It was an opportunity to work
together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But even with this help, and periodic cost-control meetings, the
price crept beyond the budget, and it became clear that the couple
wouldn't be able to afford the house. Mr. Blades, a sometime
investor, played the stock market, investing in options and
eventually getting into trouble. Just when he faced a $90,000 loss,
he bet the ranch by holding on to stocks that seemed to be heading
south. The market turned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We muscled our way through and ended up a couple hundred
thousand dollars ahead,'' he said. ``I had no other way of making
money, so we went for it. I wouldn't do it again.`
</P>
<P>
   They finally moved in, five years after they met Mayne (and
after they dislodged an overdedicated contractor). True to
unconventional form, the couple have not colonized the interior
with designer couches and chairs but have settled in slowly,
testing how they want to live in it. Its ambiguity makes it a house
of several natures. ``The complexity gives us many different
locations in the house and on the property to be in,'' Mr. Blades
said. ``It's a matter of slowly evolving into the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the kitchen, dining and living areas and bedroom occupy
parts of a continuum under the arching roof, ``they're all open to
each other,'' he said, adding, ``We're definitely living in a loft,
but a loft open laterally to adjacent yards and terraces.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Blades said: ``There's a feeling of continuity going
through inside and outside, and for us that opens up opportunities.
From inside, you just see all of nature come alive _ the grass
changing colors seasonally, the moon casting its shadows through
the house, coyotes on the kill.''
</P>
<P>
   Duped by Mayne's sliding glass doors and overlapping boundary
walls, a road runner and a gopher snake had, she noted, dropped in
for a visit.
</P>
<P>
   There is not just one way to live in it. ``Because of the
fragmentation, you have to mentally complete the work yourself,''
the architect said. ``I want the house to engage people's
perception. That's how people finally interact with the work:
they're involved with it. If it's completely predigested and
there's only one reading, finally it's just not interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bladeses spent months living primarily in the kitchen and
bedroom areas, adjusting to its character like a sailor tuning and
trimming a boat. They talk excitedly of exploring rooms, of
``sleeping in an area that was more of a cave entrance than a
house,'' Mr. Blades said. ``Most structures, you walk around a
corner, and you understand it right away, and you're bored with
it,'' he added. ``Here the windows in the concrete walls are all
different, and you can clearly feel the sun moving, projecting
shadows through the openings. Your eye steps from one fragment to
another, which keeps the house from being flat.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife said: ``Unlike houses where your views are limited to
15 feet, here your eye moves 40, 50, 60 feet. The area of privacy
has expanded way out into a much larger visual field.''
</P>
<P>
   They're still tentative about furnishing it. ``Do you need a
living room?'' they ask each other. ``What is it, anyway?'' For Mr.
Blades, populating this open space with sofas is the equivalent of
moving furniture into a natural picnic area: one should tread
lightly, if at all. ``We prefer it kind of empty. We feel more
connected to the outside.''
</P>
<P>
   When they slide open the room's glass doors, they feel, Mrs.
Blades said, ``as though we're in a tent, or under a tarp swung
over a branch, and the house is like a series of pathways from one
part to another.''
</P>
<P>
   They are equally tentative about finishing the yard, and not
only because Mr. Blades had quadruple-bypass surgery this year. In
addition, Mr. Blades said, ``financially we hit a wall.'' The final
cost was $800,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The property has native oak and grasses, and we've been
struggling with how to extend that within the building,'' he said.
``The yard has a wild, heavy Western feel, and it is interesting to
formalize it without killing the native influence, which I'll do
with plants and sculpture. From Day 1, I've been waiting for that
moment. For now I get partway through a piece, and I can try it in
a zillion different places, in the yard and in the house, and stand
it two feet away, or 40 feet, getting a continuity of approach that
you just don't usually have in many buildings, let alone houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel free here. And for our relationship, we're much better
able to do things together, cooking in that kitchen, doing the art.
I feel an opposite of claustrophobia. I feel much more comfortable.
It's really a riot, taking a shower in the open _ it feels so
funky. Life has expanded for us.''

WEB PAGES ADS FILTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)   (Eds: The (AT) word should be replaced by the symbol)  
 (af)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For every problem, there is an equal and opposite invention.
First there was dirt, then vacuum cleaners. Next there were TV
commercials, followed quickly by the remote control, for whizzing
past them.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1994, Hotwired, a portal site, introduced the Web's
first advertisements, and less than a year later, Web Filter
emerged as the first software to keep ads from loading on Web
pages.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of such filters are available now, many for free, some
for sale, with more being introduced all the time. They range from
Intermute (www.intermute.com), a virtual mute button that removes
soundtracks, pop-up frames and automatic refresh features, to a
``decaf'' filter to avoid Java script (muffin.doit.org) to
(AT)Guard (www.atguard.com), a new $29.95 utility from WRQ that
includes a personal firewall.
</P>
<P>
   Each day several hundred people download a filter from
Junkbusters.com, a crusader in the battle against unsolicited
information, including junk snail mail. The site includes links to
other filters as well, including Web Free (www.falken.net/webfree),
for Mac users.
</P>
<P>
   But Internet advertisers are far from rolling up their banners
and finding a different medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think Web ad fliters aren't necessary,'' said Lyn Chitow
Oakes vice president of marketing at Flycast Communications, an
Internet advertising network. ``Web advertising is not very
intrusive, it doesn't stop you from getting to the information you
want, and it doesn't break up programming at all.'' Her company's
ads are designed to load faster than the underlying content.
</P>
<P>
   Internet service providers are likewise unfazed. ``There are
filters out there so somebody could record a TV show and skip the
commercials, but not many people do that,'' said Myer Berlow,
senior vice president for interactive marketing at America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he said, for much of the time users are logged onto AOL
they are in chat rooms, using e-mail or visiting content areas,
where they are not bombarded with ads.
</P>
<P>
   Many filters work by serving as a proxy, an intermediary between
the browser and the user, refusing ads and filtering out cookies,
the small files that allow servers to watch where a user browses. A
filtered Web page shows little broken window icons where the ads
would be.
</P>
<P>
   About 1 percent of Internet users filter ads, according to
Junkbusters, and many others simply direct their browsers to refuse
all images.
</P>
<P>
   The user can instruct Junkbuster's filter, the Internet
Junkbuster, by customizing a list of ad sources to be ignored. Such
lists of sources are available on line for downloading.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really an extremely minimal product,'' said Jason
Catlett, head of the Junkbusters Corp., and it uses only 200
kilobytes of disk space.
</P>
<P>
   The programs help speed Web surfing by reducing the loading time
of each page, and they cut down on the distraction of animated ads,
some that come complete with soundtracks.
</P>
<P>
   A more important reason to filter ads, Catlett said, is that
each time a person clicks on a Web page, the ad company can learn
about what he or she finds interesting, by which links or ads are
visited.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't mind the ads themselves _ it's the
surveillance behind them they dislike,'' Catlett said.
</P>
<P>
   But inertia keeps many people from filtering out their ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really, really dislike animations blinking at me,'' said
John Chapin, a software design professor at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. ``But if I were to take a step back,
advertising revenues support a lot of the `free' sites I like to
look at.''
</P>
<P>
   Catlett said many people are afraid to download a piece of
software. ``It still is a step that requires some small amount of
technical confidence,'' he said. ``And in our experience, many
people do not mind the ads. If you search on a search engine, the
ads seem to speak directly to what you're searching for. Search
engines sell the keywords that people are searching for.''
</P>
<P>
   While some companies look at ways to get around such filters,
many believe that if someone goes to the trouble of filtering ads,
there is no use antagonizing them, especially when there are so
many other potential customers to reach.
</P>
<P>
   Catlett said he believed that most surfers would continue
reading and visiting banner ads. ''They never knew a time when
there were no ads on the Web,'' he said.

   &UR; Tidying Up Bookmarks &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have been trying to find a Web-site address book that will
let me organize my bookmarks with more than the simple tools
included in the browser. Can you help?
</P>
<P>
   A. There are many shareware and freeware sites on the Web
offering a variety of bookmark-utility programs. For example, the
Windows software archive at Dave Central has more than 50 programs
on bookmark management  &UR; (www.davecentral.com/urlman.html) &LR; . In this
area of the site, you can download programs that will let you
manage your Web site URL's along with other types of information,
like e-mail and snail-mail addresses. Each program on the site
comes with a short description so you may want to experiment with a
few until you find the one that best suits your needs.
</P>
<P>
   Another place to look for bookmark organizers is the Bookmark
Utilities area of the 5 Star Shareware site
 &UR; (www.5star-shareware.com) &LR; . This site also has a page of links to
even more shareware pages. While many of these sites are for
Windows programs only,  &UR; www.passtheshareware.com/mac.htm &LR;  offers
Macintosh users many shareware links for Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Although shareware and freeware programs are bountiful on the
Web, some are better written than others, so keep that in mind as
you sample the wares. And remember the standard user warning:
install at your own risk.

VISION OF WILD ROBOTS, TAME ROBOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark W.Tilden, an engineer and physicist at the Los Alamos
National Laboratory in New Mexico, is the founder of one of the
more vigorous robot-developer subcultures, called BEAM, for
Biology, Electronics, Aesthetics and Mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   BEAM robots are typically small, buglike, solar-powered devices
created from springs and wires and scavenged parts of old pagers,
cassette players and other effluvia of the electronic era.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most other robots, BEAM bots almost always lack
microprocessors and complex software. The key words are small,
simple, cheap and hardy, which makes BEAM robots ideal for
hobbyists, ranging from grade-school students to physicists.
</P>
<P>
   The following are excerpts from an e-mail exchange with Tilden
this week: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you think we'll have personal robots any time soon?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Three reasons we don't have robots: autonomy, complexity and
Terminator-phobia. Autonomy in that try as we can, we cannot
commercialize a working machine with the independent-power life
span of a housefly. Complexity: If 60 percent of all VCRs are
flashing 12:00, who's going to take the time to program a
robo-puppy that's too fragile to play with?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's Terminator-phobia, or more exactly, the
cultural leftovers of the Industrial Revolution. Not a day goes by
without the ``robots will take over'' message blared from many a
media orifice (no disrespect intended). The fact is that without
humans, all machines stop. So chill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you think consumers are ready to bring robots into their
homes?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Robots should be designed and placed in the outside world,
where they can perform unsupervised tasks for years without human
supervision. Rain-forest-planting, Chernobyl-cleaning,
land-mine-stomping, moon-prepping machines.
</P>
<P>
   Once we have these ``wild'' robots and they are seen to work,
then and only then will people take an interest to domesticate
them. If a kid brings home a wild robot and grows bored with it in
a few days, no problem, let it back out into the forest to repair
the fiber cable.
</P>
<P>
   After this will come the second market, which will be bots for
the home. Not a Lt. Cmdr. Data in an apron, but instead a
collection of slow automatic devices for house and garden that will
passively, reliably, do the job of removing small inconveniences
from your life.

   In this compelling commentary, Dr. Joseph Rotblat, a Polish-born
physicist, who won the 1995 Nobel Peace Prize, tells why he started
on the A-bomb project, and then withdrew, and why other scientists
did not. (slugged: BC-HIROSHIMA-ROTBLAT-ABOMB-NYTSF)

   In this op-ed, Oscar Arias, former president of Costa Rica and

   In this column, Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet president _
who helped bring an end to the Cold War and the superpower nuclear
arms race _ draws attention to the tragedy of a renewed arms race
in South Asia. ``We should do all we can to help Pakistan and India

HERO'S BURIAL CUTS REP. STUMP DOWN TO SIZE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID LEIBOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - The cop's heart had been still a minute when the D.C.
vultures grabbed his corpse. They emoted for ``Nightline,'' for
``Today,'' forever. The pols keened long and loud over Detective
John Gibson, shot dead defending our Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   It's a Washington dwarf's fondest dream: heroism by association,
to gain honor on the coattails of a giant.
</P>
<P>
   Now Arizona's own, Rep. Bob Stump, R-District 3, has a new
twist: To build himself up by tearing a hero down.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the madman halted, the lives saved by Gibson and Officer
Jacob Chestnut. Stump has sponsored a bill! It must become law!
Stump, guardian of hallowed ground, must be heeded!
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, he says, doesn't belong in Arlington National Cemetery.
His sin? He wore the wrong uniform. Gibson, a father of three,
wasn't a war veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have anything against him,'' Stump said Tuesday. ``I
knew him. He was a fine gentleman and everything else. But daily,
there's probably a fireman or a policeman killed in this country
laying his life on the line for somebody else. We can't bury all of
them in Arlington, so where do you draw the line?
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we passed that bill, I thought it was the right thing to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   He thought wrong. Way wrong. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Pandering to the voters &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The brainchild Stump brags of is House Bill 3211, passed 412-0
by the House in March, but stalled ever since in the Senate. You
will find no better example of legislation crafted only to get
headlines and pander to voters. Some history:
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Larry Lawrence made big news. A $10 million donor to
the Dems, the late millionaire was once ambassador to Switzerland
and, allegedly, a Merchant Marine wounded in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   This last fact earned Lawrence a waiver into Arlington in 1996.
That ended when Stump, et al., discovered Lawrence's war record was
fake.
</P>
<P>
   A GOP-hyped scandal erupted as the bulldozer dug up Lawrence's
coffin: Bill Clinton was hawking Arlington plots!
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's absolutely ridiculous,'' Stump thundered. ``It's
a desecration almost to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad Clinton wasn't doing it.
</P>
<P>
   That's what emerged from the hearings Stump led as chair of the
House veterans' committee: There had been no peddling of graves. In
fact, in the 31 years since the Army tightened entrance to
Arlington, there had been only 196 waivers by either a president or
the Secretary of the Army.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton personally OK'd four: Supreme Court Justice Thurgood
Marshall; the wife of Chief Justice Warren Burger; a vet turned DEA
agent killed in Peru; and Hank Daly, a vet and beloved D.C. cop for
28 years murdered in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Arlington has 263,369 graves.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, you might think, has bigger issues to botch. This only
proves you're not Bob Stump.
</P>
<P>
   To fix the ``crisis,'' Stump's bill ends waivers for non-vets,
or vets who didn't meet his standard of military greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Got to keep the riff-raff out, you know?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Taking away dignity &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like Justice Marshall, the first Black ever to serve on the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Like Challenger astronaut Christa McAuliffe, whose remains lie
commingled with the other shuttle casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Like civil-rights giant Medgar Evers, the ex-Army sergeant
assassinated by a Ku Klux Klan member in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   And like Detective John Gibson, 18 years a veteran of the
Capitol police force, but not veteran enough for Bob Stump.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just an effort to keep this most hallowed of all
cemeteries a place for special veterans,'' Stump said. ``That's
what we tried to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way devoid of everything Arlington stands for: dignity,
courage, honor.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Stump mentioned amending 3211, to add waivers for
heroic civilians. If this sounds like backing down, let's hope he
keeps the one idea he got right.
</P>
<P>
   H.B. 3211 ends automatic waivers for Congressmen with mere
military service.
</P>
<P>
   Congressmen, for example, like Bob Stump, United States Navy.
</P>
<P>
   I figure eternity beside a politician would have 200,000 real
heroes like John Gibson turning over in their graves. &QL;

NEW ZEALAND AIDS VICTIM NOW IN U.S. FACES IMMIGRATION HEARING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE CHAO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Christopher Arnesen, an AIDS patient from New
Zealand, feared he would be arrested, or worse, sent back on the
next flight out of San Francisco when he arrived at the airport
Tuesday, defying a federal ban on foreigners with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Officials escorted him through the airport, and Arnesen was
allowed to enter the country. But he still faces a battle with the
Immigration and Naturalization Service over his immigration status.
</P>
<P>
   The agency ordered him to appear at an Aug. 17 interview where
it will begin an inquiry into his case.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no certainty I'll be allowed to stay,'' Arnesen told
the press at the airport. ``I am scared beyond belief.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnesen, a 56-year-old New Zealand native, lived in the United
States from 1966 to 1994, spending most of that time in San
Francisco. As a permanent resident, he had a green card and paid
federal taxes on the income he earned as a photographer and tour
guide.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to New Zealand in 1994 partly because of his illness
and partly because a Social Security representative told him,
incorrectly, that he had to apply for disability benefits from
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he hasn't been able to return because of a federal
law barring entry of most foreigners with AIDS. But he decided to
risk arrest to return to the United States to collect the benefits
he is owed. By law, foreigners must live in the country one of
every six months to receive Social Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   At the Aug. 17 interview, an INS officer will either say Arnesen
can be admitted or serve him with documents demanding that he
appear in immigration court, according to Chuck DeMore, deputy
director of the San Francisco district of the INS.
</P>
<P>
   The crux of the conflict between Arnesen and the INS is whether
permanent residents are subject to HIV exclusion laws. His
attorneys contend that they are not.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Boswell, a professor at Hastings College of the Law here
who specializes in immigration, said the law is designed to protect
long-term permanent residents who depart temporarily with every
intention of returning and then cannot do so within the time the
INS sets because of some unforeseen event beyond their control.
</P>
<P>
   However, DeMore of the INS said permanent residents who test
positive for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, must apply for a
waiver to be allowed re-entry.
</P>
<P>
   At the airport Arnesen gleefully showed off stickers on his
suitcase that read ``loathsome, contagious &AMP; proud.'' The stickers
referred to a letter he received from the State Department that
cited the federal law barring visitors with ``loathsome or
contagious diseases.''

SIX FLAGS SITE IS QUITE A RIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alan Reynolds of Austin had a dream. It might not have been a
noble civil rights dream, but it was a dream nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up with the feeling that it was very important that I
put a site \R(www.jump.net/\Palanr)\S together that would help
former employees of Six Flags Over Texas find each other,''
Reynolds said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason unknown to me, I have dreams of returning to
work at Six Flags.''
</P>
<P>
   GIven the raging heat that has enveloped Texas this summer, that
dream sounds more like a nightmare, but Reynolds is passionate
about the amusement park he worked for more than 20 years ago. His
Six Flags Over Texas Employee Contact Page is a log ride down
memory lane for those who have visited the Arlington park, and
especially for those who have worked there.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds has collected old pictures of the park, employee
stories, trivia, gone-but-not-forgotten rides and attraction pages,
old park maps and trip reports. He also includes a petition calling
on park officials to bring back the eerie but popular Spee-Lunkers,
who were replaced by Warner Bros. characters at the park's cave
ride.
</P>
<P>
   Writes one petitioner: ``We all want \Rthe Spee-Lunkers back\S
... the Looney Tunes characters scare me worse than they did.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NASA's Earth and space science site (observe.ivv.nasa.gov) is
taking a look at impact craters and tsunamis in articles coinciding
with this summer's disaster movies, ``Armageddon'' and ``Deep
Impact.'' In a news release, NASA is promoting two online articles
about the possible aftereffects of a celestial collision.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't been to the doctor in a while, you might find
MSNBC's new health area (www.msnbc.com) worth a visit. The site's
``Virtual Checkup'' is a series of quizzes to help you decide
whether you're at risk for various disorders. Articles include an
``Interactive Calculator,'' which gives users an estimate on how
long they will live given their current health, habits and
lifestyle. _ Tommy Cummings, (817) 390-7397

SIX FLAGS SITE IS QUITE A RIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alan Reynolds of Austin had a dream. It might not have been a
noble civil rights dream, but it was a dream nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up with the feeling that it was very important that I
put a site \R(www.jump.net/\Palanr)\S together that would help
former employees of Six Flags Over Texas find each other,''
Reynolds said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason unknown to me, I have dreams of returning to
work at Six Flags.''
</P>
<P>
   GIven the raging heat that has enveloped Texas this summer, that
dream sounds more like a nightmare, but Reynolds is passionate
about the amusement park he worked for more than 20 years ago. His
Six Flags Over Texas Employee Contact Page is a log ride down
memory lane for those who have visited the Arlington park, and
especially for those who have worked there.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds has collected old pictures of the park, employee
stories, trivia, gone-but-not-forgotten rides and attraction pages,
old park maps and trip reports. He also includes a petition calling
on park officials to bring back the eerie but popular Spee-Lunkers,
who were replaced by Warner Bros. characters at the park's cave
ride.
</P>
<P>
   Writes one petitioner: ``We all want \Rthe Spee-Lunkers back\S
... the Looney Tunes characters scare me worse than they did.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NASA's Earth and space science site (observe.ivv.nasa.gov) is
taking a look at impact craters and tsunamis in articles coinciding
with this summer's disaster movies, ``Armageddon'' and ``Deep
Impact.'' In a news release, NASA is promoting two online articles
about the possible aftereffects of a celestial collision.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't been to the doctor in a while, you might find
MSNBC's new health area (www.msnbc.com) worth a visit. The site's
``Virtual Checkup'' is a series of quizzes to help you decide
whether you're at risk for various disorders. Articles include an
``Interactive Calculator,'' which gives users an estimate on how
long they will live given their current health, habits and
lifestyle. _ Tommy Cummings, (817) 390-7397

<P>
   You've gotten your Whopper meal for lunch at the Burger King at
182 Broadway in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   What's next?
</P>
<P>
   Let's see ... napkins, straw, salt packet, mustard, e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. E-mail.
</P>
<P>
   It's available at the world's first Internet-enabled Burger King
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Nestled near New York's financial district in lower Manhattan,
the fast-food joint lets its customers not only hoard the
condiments and cardboard crowns but also access any of the 20
high-speed Internet stations ... by king-sizing your Value Meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers are sending and receiving e-mail, checking their
stocks and financial news, looking for apartments and jobs,
obtaining travel information, joining chat groups and playing
various interactive games,'' Peter Allen Abramson, Burger King
franchisee, said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes dining, particularly alone, more enjoyable.''
</P>
<P>
   Abramson's customers _ some tourists, some residential, but
mostly from nearby Wall Street _ are allowed 20 minutes to navigate
the Web from high-speed T-1 connections. A two-minute-warning
message appears on the monitor when Internet access is about to be
terminated. Filtering technology prevents access to inappropriate
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Abramson said the concept for the restaurant ``just came in my
head one day.'' The location of his business, which has stiff
competition from other fast-food restaurants, meant he had to have
a niche; ``I had to get something to differentiate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What are the chances of Burger King starting a cybercafe
elsewhere?
</P>
<P>
   Abramson answers in his news release: ``I will make my
technology available to other franchisees. It is a concept I want
to share with the entire Burger King system.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's will probably answer the challenge with something
called Power Big Macs or McInternet.
</P>
<P>
   NETTING THE BIKERS
</P>
<P>
   If you can't be one of the 250,000 who are expected to make it
to the Sturgis Rally bike party in Sturgis, S.D., this week, don't
sweat it.
</P>
<P>
   Boot down the kickstand on your hog and then boot up
SturgisLive.com (www.sturgislive.com).
</P>
<P>
   This year, biker enthusiasts can check the event's official site
for live images, event photos, event history, the Chew the Fat chat
room, an online store and archived concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Sturgis Rally and Race, sponsor of the site, plans to post
edited highlights of the rally on its final two days, Saturday and
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU DIG TEXAS
</P>
<P>
   The Texas State Library and Archives Commission has found a way
for those interested in state history to get a closer look at
fragile artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's Texas Treasures site
(www.tsl.state.tx.us/lobby/treasures) features digitally scanned
images of resources from the State Archives' holdings.
</P>
<P>
   The artifacts include William B. Travis' letter from the Alamo;
county-by-county vote totals from the 1845 Texas referendum on
annexation; and a collection of flags from the Texas Revolution and
Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   State archivist Christopher LaPlante said the site will remain a
work in progress. ``We've just begun to scratch the surface,'' he
said. _ Tommy Cummings, (817) 390-7397 dragon\Nstar-telegram.com

<P>
   CALIFORNIA -- GAYS-HEFLEY. (Expected.) A week after the House
narrowly passed an anti-gay rights measure targeted at San
Francisco's domestic partner law, the House is expected to vote on
a measure by Joel Hefley, R-Colo., that would overturn President
Clinton's executive order which prohibits federal job
discrimination against homosexuals. Zaret/Feldman
</P>
<P>
   -- DORNAN-SANCHEZ. In a surprising reversal, the House Oversight
Committee is expected to pay the legal fees incurred by Rep.
Loretta Sanchez, D-Garden Grove, and former-Rep. Bob Dornan during
the 16-month investigation into allegations of voter fraud during
the 1996 election -- allegations that were dismissed in February.
Local groups who were subpoenaed during the investigation, however,
are upset over the decision because they also incurred thousands of
dollars of legal costs. Zaret
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO -- HEFLEY-GAYS. (Expected.) The House is expected to
vote on a measure by Joel Hefley, R-Colorado Springs, that would
overturn President Clinton's executive order that prohibits federal
job discrimination against homosexuals. The vote comes a week after
the House narrowly passed an anti-gay rights measure targeted at
San Francisco. Zaret/Feldman
</P>
<P>
   ILLINOIS -- BRIEFS. Column for Sunday. (Working.) Eckstein
</P>
<P>
   LOUISIANA -- WALK. Louisiana ranks as one of the most dangerous
states for pedestrians killed in traffic accidents, according to a
new report. Egbert
</P>
<P>
   MICHIGAN -- PRISONS. A panel of experts testified that the
current Prison Industries takes jobs from hard-working Americans
while doing little to socialize inmates. Wolfberg
</P>
<P>
   NEVADA -- VISITS. Two cabinet secretaries are scheduled to visit
the Silver State in the next three weeks to discuss various issues
and at least one instance would indirectly help boost two
Democratic political campaigns. (Possible.) Preston
</P>
<P>
   OHIO -- NAZI. Congress this week passed a bill sponsored by Sen.
Mike Dewine, R-Ohio, to make U.S. government records on Nazi war
criminals public. (Working.) Gorman
</P>
<P>
   PENNSYLVANIA -- MURTHA. The House is set to vote on Rep. John
Murtha's anti-federal prosecutors bill today. Kane
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS -- TILT-ROTOR. Bell-Helicopter will locate its plant to
build the V-22 Osprey in Amarillo. What did it take to keep the
project alive and get it to Amarillo after years of opposition?
(For Sunday.) Brown
</P>
<P>
   VIRGIN ISLANDS -- SENATE. A plan to downsize the V.I.
Legislature sailed through the House Resources Committee Wednesday.
Williams
</P>
<P>
   WISCONSIN -- PROFILE. Rep. David Obey is the senior congressman
in the delegation, and is the most influential of all the state's
Democrats, while Rep. Jay Johnson is a freshman with little
influence and a hotly targeted seat. (Working.) Marlin
</P>
<P>
   -- FINANCE. (Contingent on House action tonight.) After more
than two months of rancorous, drawn-out debate, the House passed a
campaign finance reform bill and sent it over to the Senate for
approval Wednesday. Marlin

BEFORE SUMMER FADES, TAKE TIME TO EXERCISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ If you're feeling agitated about August, you're
not alone.
</P>
<P>
   This is a tricky month. Chronologically, as the month begins,
summer is about half over. Psychologically, many of us view that
fact with a mixture of resignation and regret, and use it as one
more excuse not to exercise or eat better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we know it, we're going to be picking apples and the
kids are going back to school,'' said Nancy Cummings, a mother of
two and the director of the Marjorie Doyle Rockwell Center, an
Alzheimer's care center in Cohoes, N.Y. ``Where did the summer
go?''
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Owens, an Albany social worker, is familiar with the
mid-summer blues, that sense that if only we had more time, we
could get in shape, ride our bikes, improve our health and do
everything else we want to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brings about that feeling that time is passing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   People who live in the Northeast tend to be more susceptible to
seasonal mood changes than those who live in California or the
South, where seasons are a state of mind, not a cold fact on the
calendar.
</P>
<P>
   In the winter, the lack of light from shorter days is believed
to be a trigger for seasonal affective disorder, a more serious
condition that may cause depression and irritability.
</P>
<P>
   So what can you do to avoid getting stuck in a seasonal slump
this summer? Owens suggests making time work for you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the seasonal variations produce some anxiety and
discomfort, they can be a stimulus for growth,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled the case of an artist who moved to California after
growing up in the Northeast. His productivity dropped in his new
climate. Eventually, he moved back, and experienced a boost in his
mood and output.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt the change of seasons brought about a sense that time
was passing and he had to get moving,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it can be a source of motivation, not malaise.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean adding to your to-do list. Owens advises
taking a second look at that list and re-evaluating what's
important. If you're dissatisfied, there's still plenty of time to
turn your summer around before the season turns on you.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to realistically assess where they're putting
their energy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Coughlin, the fitness program director at the Wellness
Center at Sunnyview Rehabilitation Center in Schenectady, N.Y.,
knows how the passage of time can work against people and their
good intentions to improve their fitness.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just get started with the summer and then they already
look to the end,'' Coughlin said. ``People get really uptight.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of worrying about what you haven't done, she suggests
focusing on what you can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do 10 this week, you can do 15 week,'' she said about
exercises like walking or jogging. ``It doesn't take that long to
see results. Two weeks to a month and you're going to see changes
in the way you feel.''
</P>
<P>
   That's plenty of time before fall.
</P>
<P>
   If you're stuck inside all day, she suggests exercising muscles
at your desk. Pull your stomach in and hold it. Do it again. Or
take five minutes to walk up a flight of stairs. When you get home,
take the kids for a bike ride or walk around the block.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, exercise can give you more energy to make the most
of the time you have. ``It makes you step back a minute and realize
I can get all this done,'' Coughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings, 43, realizes she doesn't have time not to exercise,
considering the energy she needs for her job, her family and her
graduate classes. Since May, she's been using her lunchtime to
walk.
</P>
<P>
   As she's discovered, 30 minutes, like an entire summer, can
evaporate before we know it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time just goes by so quickly,'' she said.

IN SEARCH OF OLD POTS BRIMMING WITH GOLD  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHLEEN MOLONEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZANESVILLE, Ohio _ To the unschooled traveler, this small
Muskingum County town is the middle of nowhere _ best known for
having the country's biggest ``Y'' bridge. But for anyone with a
passion for American pottery, it's the center of the universe.
Zanesville, population 26,000, is the birthplace of Zane Grey,
Agnes Moorehead and most of the pottery made in the United States
since the mid-19th century.
</P>
<P>
   This is where Weller, Roseville and Van Briggle pottery came
from, not to mention McCoy, Brush, Hull, Watt, Robinson-Ransbottom
and Shawnee. And every year in mid-July, it's where 5,000 or so
sociable obsessives gather to buy, sell, trade and talk pottery. A
unique and crazy blend of bazaar, museum, think tank and fraternity
party, Pottery Lovers Week is a bona fide slice of Americana.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually everyone who lives in Zanesville (and in nearby
Crooksville, Avondale and Roseville) used to work in one of the
potteries or is related to someone who did: a grandfather who made
molds, an uncle who dipped pots, an aunt who worked in decorating.
Most of the potteries have long since burned down (as a general
rule, potteries don't close, but burn), but local basements are
chockablock with samples, salvage, factory rejects and
miscellaneous treasures _ or so the rumors go.
</P>
<P>
   Residents with an eye for business save their basement booty for
Pottery Lovers Week. Opal Dunn of Roseville, who has been
collecting pottery for more than 40 years and had some very rare
pieces, sold her entire collection during 1998 pottery week. The
turnout was huge, and a McCoy prototype cookie jar called the
Reclining Cow went for $10,000, a sum that came as no surprise to
hard-core collectors. As far as anyone knows, only two Reclining
Cows were ever made. Still, a Crooksville resident who worked for
both Hull and Watt in the old days was suitably impressed.
``Heck,'' he said. ``I only paid $6,500 for my house!''
</P>
<P>
   Serious money changes hands in Zanesville in July, and 1998 was
an especially good year. (It's the economy.) The shops and malls,
which earn roughly half their yearly income during the month,
reported nothing but good news. Marti Hawk of the Market Street
Gallery, who offers free refreshments around the clock during
pottery week, and her husband, Herb, sold a five-figure piece the
first day and never looked back. ``We were busy every day,'' she
said, ``and not just because of the sweet rolls.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Don Treadway of Cincinnati, who has been
auctioning pottery for a quarter-century, couldn't be more bullish.
The three Treadway auctions offered 2,000 pieces of art pottery and
brought in more than $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   But pottery week is less about money than it is about the chase.
Everyone is looking for that special piece _ the rare design, the
unusual glaze, the item that isn't in any of the books. Desirable
pieces go quickly, regardless of price. Gerald Donaldson, who has
lived in the area all his life and takes his pottery seriously,
offered a succinct explanation: ``You can make money every day. But
they don't make this pottery anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   News travels fast about the week's big scores. Somebody found a
Weller Leprechaun, a beauty that nobody knew existed until the
first day of pottery week. (Weller Gnomes, yes, but not
Leprechauns.) The leprechaun, it turns out, was the five-figure
piece at the Market Street Gallery; Herb Hawk would say only that
it went for ``more than $15,000.'' Collectors buzzed nonstop about
the red 15-inch Roseville Cherry Blossom vase. ``If you're lucky,
once in a while you spot an eight-inch Cherry Blossom vase in
brown,'' Don Gill, a Massachusetts dealer, said. ``The 15-inch red
vase is something you just never see.'' It went for $4,500.
</P>
<P>
   There were other pieces that are nearly impossible to find. An
Atlanta dealer, Diane Cole, was selling a dozen Rookwood plaques,
most in their original frames. ``You can go years without seeing
one Rookwood plaque,'' said the pottery week chairman, Ted Sallaz,
who took one home with him. ``Seeing that many in one place is
amazing.'' The plaque he chose is distinctive because it isn't a
traditional landscape; the scene includes a bridge and a group of
people.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of cookie jars, people gossiped about the brown
McCoy Leprechaun that came out of the Roseville basement of Mary
Rider Spring, whose father worked in the McCoy factory for 40
years. McCoy Leprechauns are very rare and almost always red or
green. There is a good chance the brown Leprechaun jar is one of a
kind. Word on the street was that it sold for $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Pottery Week days are full and long. Early risers hit yard and
garage sales. Afternoons are taken up with auctions or antique
malls. No day is complete without a trip to the Airwood parking lot
and the Ceramic Center, where dealers and merchandise change
constantly. If you snooze, you lose. Everyone makes at least one
stop at Clara Belle's, an overstuffed shop stocked with what some
consider a museum-quality inventory. Alvin Culp, the owner, is a
walking pottery encyclopedia.
</P>
<P>
   As experienced collectors drive around the towns, they look for
``Pottery for Sale'' signs, and shops that aren't quite what they
seem. The Massage Therapy Center in Crooksville has tables filled
with pottery. So does an ice cream stand in Avondale called Lickety
Split. It's not uncommon to see people selling pottery from their
cars. ``I feel like a drug dealer,'' said Linda Romberg of
Scottsdale, Ariz., as she counted crisp $100 bills into the hand of
a fellow selling Roseville and Shawnee out of an old pickup in the
parking lot of the Tumbleweed restaurant in Zanesville.
</P>
<P>
   For most people, the evenings are reserved for shopping the
motel rooms, a phenomenon for which pottery week is famous. Instead
of renting space in a mall or an outdoor market, dealers display
their wares right in their rooms. At the Holiday Inn, Travelodge
and Red Roof Inn, shoppers walk from room to room, admiring
exquisite pottery on beds and dressers and in bathroom sinks.
Dealers read, knit, eat pizza, watch television and _ if visitors
ask the right questions _ provide a quick course in Art Pottery
101. When it's time to turn in, the  &UR; COME IN &LR;  sign is removed and
the lights go out.
</P>
<P>
   But the lights stay on fairly late in Zanesville. There's always
a mixer or a dinner or an open house somewhere. The McCoy Lovers
have a banquet, a private auction and an evening of show and tell.
The Hull pottery group gathers every year for a luncheon in honor
of former employees. Party animals should know that when Hull
zealots gather, no alcoholic beverages are permitted. Joe Yonis,
the group's founder, advanced two reasons: ``First, I'm against it
spiritually. Second, I don't think people should be allowed to
drink and handle pottery.''
</P>
<P>
   Although dealers and collectors from all over the country make
their way to Zanesville for pottery week, no one can accuse the
locals of crass commercialism. Sure, there are a few T-shirts for

yes, motel rates more or less double. But the newsstand next to
Wally's Antique Mall shuts its doors promptly at 6 p.m., the bakery
directly across the street from the Travelodge is closed all week
for vacation and several restaurants are closed on Sunday, pottery
week or no.
</P>
<P>
   Still, at least one church embraced the Pottery Lovers spirit.
On Main Street in Roseville, a bright yellow banner flew from St.
Paul's Evangelical Lutheran Church. On it was written a passage
taken from Isaiah 64:8: ``O Lord, You Are the Potter. We Are the
Clay.''

   NEW YORK _ Even before the recent accident at the Conde Nast
building in Times Square, the scaffolds and walls around New York
building sites radiated a sense of danger and daring and lent an
edge to the city.
</P>
<P>
   Like webs or cocoons, the skeins and skins seem shockingly
fragile in comparison with the girders and concrete they conceal.
To glance up and note the two narrow planks where workers install
insulation makes this acrophobe shiver.
</P>
<P>
   Four centuries ago, Michelangelo turned his attention to
scaffolding, the better to touch the heaven he was painting on the
Sistine Chapel. The architect Michael Graves recently designed a
special scaffold for the reconstruction of the Washington Monument.
But it took the current building boom to bring design to New York
scaffolds, which have become so abundant _ especially around 42nd
Street _ that designers and developers can no longer ignore them.
</P>
<P>
   The basic form of the scaffold _ steel pipes, cross-braced and
bolted _ has remained the same for decades. Covered with plywood,
the resulting structures are known in the building industry as
construction bridges (or sidewalk bridges), and the term is aptly
evocative of New York's past _ daring steelworkers atop the George
Washington and Verrazano-Narrows bridges.
</P>
<P>
   But bare plywood, spray-stenciled POST NO BILLS, has given way
to bright new imagery. Even before the recent construction began in
Times Square, Transportation Displays Inc., an outdoor-display
company, had arranged to use the construction bridges as
billboards.
</P>
<P>
   The simultaneous arrival of a new billboard technology helped:
vinyl sheets, printed by giant color computer printers. ``It's a
new palette,'' said Brigg Dinley, the company's
business-development director. ``It provides more flexible design
and lets our clients change their creative more often.''
</P>
<P>
   To see the panels change, I stood last Thursday night with Steve
Charman of Transportation Displays at the E Walk entertainment
complex on 42nd Street, where ``The Mask of Zorro'' was finishing
its two-month run. The old ad had been reduced to a couple of
letters and the name of Antonio Banderas. Approaching it across an
expanse of plywood came the new ad for the NBC fall season.
</P>
<P>
   The construction bridge was built by Atlantic-Heydt, one of the
major contractors in the business. Transportation Displays paid the
company to make sure the bridge would support its vinyl panels,
each 16 feet wide and about three times the thickness of a plastic
tarp. The NBC panels were printed at Mega Art on Pier 40. There,
like the shuttle of a loom, the head of an ink-jet printer, feeding
on three colorful ink bottles, skitters back and forth across the
sheets.
</P>
<P>
   The first panel, with ``E.R.'' and ``Veronica's Closet,'' was
already in place when I arrived around 11. A second panel hung from
ropes. A gust of wind suddenly grabbed it and puffed out Kelsey
Grammer's face, as if he had just shifted a huge wad of gum into
his cheek.
</P>
<P>
   Workers tugged the Kelsey Grammer panel upward, while others
pulled the vinyl tight like an artist's canvas. Then a huge man in
a Green Bay Packers shirt drove screws into the bottom. By 6 in the
morning the whole ad would greet early commuters. Transportation
Displays declined to discuss what the job cost NBC, but a company
spokesman said that billboards on 42nd Street ranged from $50,000
to $100,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   To those making their way through the yellow forest of trusses
beneath the bridge, the ads are invisible. Lest they feel too much
like trolls, the 42nd Street Development Project hired M &AMP; Co., a
New York design firm, to decorate the wall beneath.
</P>
<P>
   The result, called ``The People of 42nd Street,'' was paid for
by the developers of new buildings in the area, as a public
amenity. It consists of photographs taken by Neil Selkirk of random
passers-by. To the final images were added each person's name and
red circles with his or her reason for being on the street: ``Bao.
Jersey City. Going to philosophy class at Hunter College.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, when construction bridges went up around buildings
after a rash of falling masonry, they implied decay. Today they
radiate a sense of optimism and change. But to this pedestrian's
eye, it is less the images that dominate the scaffold-scape than
the pipes and fences, the webs and nets. These create a visual
buzz, backbeats for the eye, relentless as rap and rich as reggae.
</P>
<P>
   The layers make the work inside seem more mysterious. But for
all the energy they radiate, I regret that there seem to be fewer
glimpses inside _ fewer of the old sidewalk-superintendent
peepholes once thoughtfully cut into the walls at levels convenient
for adults and children to peek at crane and steam shovel at work.

   Rethinking Modern Judaism
</P>
<P>
   Arnold M. Eisen
</P>
<P>
   The University of Chicago Press, $35
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Eisen, the chairman of the Jewish Studies Department at
Stanford University, skillfully leads readers through the past 200
years of Jewish attempts to maintain and adapt Judaism in the
modern world. Eisen moves deftly from philosopher Moses Mendelssohn
in the late 17th century through contemporary Jewish feminist
thinkers, stopping along the way to place all the modern Jewish
denominational streams, and major theologians such as Martin Buber,
in context.
</P>
<P>
   Eisen emphasizes that Orthodox thinkers no less than Reformers
and secularists were responding to their times. Enlightenment
philosophy and the political disestablishment of religion freed
Jews to become part of mainstream Western cultures. But that same
philosophy insisted that religion is established by reason and is
chiefly concerned with morality. That undermined belief in specific
revelations such as the Torah, and made prayer and ritual
observance secondary in the religious enterprise. So why bother to
remain Jewish?
</P>
<P>
   Along with surveying the plethora of modern answers, Eisen comes
to an important realization, buttressed by sociological and
anthropological theory: We are used to thinking that theory leads
to practice. In religious traditions, however, at least as often,
we start with a commitment to a tradition and its God, and then
look for theories to justify it. Practice, not theology, is
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Eisen devotes his final chapter to advising rabbis and other
Jewish leaders how to do better at maintaining the loyalty of
modern Jews. They must still deal with questions of faith, of
course. Yet the implications of Eisen's analysis are clear. It is
more important to reinvigorate ritual than to rethink theology.
Prayers and ceremonies must be about more than serving God. They
must do such things as creating community and linking modern Jews
to their ancestors, as well. More ominously, they must provide
meanings that moderns are comfortable hearing and not make too
great a demand on people's time.
</P>
<P>
   Only the rare lay person will make it through ``Rethinking
Modern Judaism,'' but those who do will be well-rewarded for their
labors. It's due in bookstores Aug. 15.

</P>
<P>
   The music on this album is somewhat of a departure from their

the sound a little more mature.
</P>
<P>
   It's not enough of a departure, though, to cost Point of Grace
any fans, or likely to win any from the modern or alternative rock
camps. This is still safe and solid pop, with toe-tapping rhythms
and catchy hooks.
</P>
<P>
   Although the sound is subtly different, the message and the
delivery remain the same. And the message remains the reason for
Point of Grace's existence. As always, the songs are about faith,
hope, encouragement and _ most important _ God's love.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday morning, nearly 2{ inches of rain deluged
Milwaukee, Wis., in just one hour. The downpour was caused by
slow-moving showers and thunderstorms sparked by a stagnant
low-pressure system over the upper Middle West.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, with the steering winds of the jet stream receded
far into Canada, the lethargic low will continue to spark sluggish
showers and storms across parts of the Great Lakes region. A
corridor of scattered showers and storms will extend southwestward
from the middle Mississippi Valley to central Texas along and ahead
of a weak cool front attached to the low.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, very humid air from the Gulf of California
streamed northward into the deserts of southern California and
southern Arizona. On Thursday, invading tropical moisture will
provide fuel for late afternoon showers and heavy thunderstorms. A
few of the storms could approach severe levels, with damaging winds
posing a threat in spots.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, isolated but potentially powerful thunderstorms will
erupt along the Front Range of the southern Rockies in New Mexico
and Colorado and then drift eastward over the high plains from
northwest Texas to Kansas and Nebraska. A few storms will reach
severe levels, with streaks of large hail posing a threat.
</P>
<P>
   Very warm and more humid conditions will hold steady over the
Northeast and Middle Atlantic States. Only spotty showers and
thunderstorms, mainly from the Adirondacks of upstate New York to
the mountains of northern New England, will provide relief from the
current regional dry spell.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Herculean Contrasts
</P>
<P>
   Heat has mounted in the valleys of northern California this
week, yet temperatures in some towns nestled against the cool
Pacific have struggled to reach 60 degrees. Indeed, experiencing
temperature changes from the upper 50s to more than 110 degrees has
been possible on a drive of several miles east from the coast.
These contrasts, though Herculean, have not led to thunderstorms.
To create an environment for storms, there must also be a rapid
drop in temperature with increasing altitude. During California's
summer, warm high pressure aloft limits vertical temperature
contrasts.

HOUSE DEMOCRATS PLEDGE LEWINSKY SCANDAL WON'T OVERSHADOW ISSUES

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Democrats met behind closed doors with
President Clinton Wednesday and later expressed their determination
to keep working on their election-year legislative agenda despite
the Monica Lewinsky controversy.
</P>
<P>
   During the 75-minute pep-rally on Capitol Hill, neither the
president, Vice President Al Gore nor any of the legislators
broached the Lewinsky matter, according to Democrats at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has agreed to give testimony on Aug. 17 to the grand
jury looking into whether Clinton and others committed perjury or
obstruction of justice in connection with an alleged sexual affair
and coverup.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic House members greeted the president with a standing
ovation and cheers after which Clinton pledged, ``I'm going to
raise issues, raise money and raise Cain to help elect Democrats,''
according to members at the caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 206 House Democrats attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering came as Clinton faces pressure from some
Democrats, including his former chief of staff, Leon Panetta, to
explain the Lewinsky matter publicly. However, Clinton's approval
ratings have remained high, topping 60 percent, making him valuable
to Democratic candidates with elections three months away.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Clinton appeared undaunted by
the sex controversy swirling around him and was ``strong, forceful
and appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no cloud over our caucus this morning,'' Pelosi
said. ``It was about cooperation and teamwork. It was substantive,
constructive and very unifying.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton rallied Democrats by talking about saving the Social
Security system, improving health care and public schools,
maintaining a balanced budget, helping farmers and keeping a clean
environment, lawmakers later said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said he would veto any spending bill that doesn't
allow for statistical sampling in the 2000 Census, members said.
Democrats, claiming that traditional head counts discriminate
against minorities, favor the sampling process, which allows Census
officials to extrapolate population numbers based on population
samples.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles B. Rangel, D-N.Y., the top Democrat on the Ways and
Means Committee, said it became clear in the meeting that Clinton
and House Democrats ``are not only speaking the same language, we
are thinking the same thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ellen Tauscher, D-Calif., said the meeting with the
president was a relief because it ``was like a rumor-free zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Tauscher said ``there are plenty of people paying attention'' to
the Lewinsky case and that she was happy to hear the president
focus instead on issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speculation and rehashing is frankly not what I believe my
job is,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tauscher said the American people don't want to dwell on
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty disrespectful that the media, pundits and
attorneys are filling up the airwaves with constant speculation and
innuendo,'' Tauscher said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., chairman of the Congressional
Democratic Caucus, said ``the silence was deafening on the
so-called Washington scandals'' during the meeting. Fazio said
support for Clinton ``is as strong as it's ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in sync on the issues,'' Fazio said, adding that most
people in the caucus realize that the issues swirling around the
president and Lewinsky, a former White House intern, ``will be
resolved between the president, the grand jury and (independent
counsel) Ken Starr.''
</P>
<P>
   Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said after the meeting,
that House Democrats and Clinton ``have got a very unified position
on the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the president, we're the minority in the Congress, we're
trying to be the majority, and he is really helping us articulate
our message,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Rep. Nick Lampson, D-Texas, said the atmosphere in the
room was full of ``enthusiasm, unity and magnetism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of belief that we have a wonderful opportunity
to regain the House,'' Lampson said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, facing an uphill battle to overcome the 11-vote
Republican majority in the House, say they need the president to
help raise money and energize voters by speaking out on such issues
as the proposed ``patients' bill of rights'' that would bolster the
bargaining power of patients receiving health care through managed
care programs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has already raised $8 million for House Democrats by
appearing at a dozen Democratic fund-raising events, Rep. Martin
Frost, D-Texas, head of the House Democrats' re-election committee,
told the caucus Wednesday. And Clinton was expected to pull in
another $1.2 million starring at a Democratic ``Unity Fund'' dinner
Wednesday night.

 &HT;    Leaving the Nest: Three weeks with your 6-year-old is not much
time. It's almost over before it begins. But this summer's
father-son reunion will last more than a lifetime.
 &HT;    ATTN: COX -- FEATURES EDITORS
 &HT;    For Monday, Aug. 3
 &HT;    By Paul Reid
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service-Palm Beach Post
<TEXT>
<P>
   Each morning for the last three weeks my 6-year-old son,
Patrick, awakened me with the same words: Dad, let's go check the
baby bird. And each morning we would quietly exit the back door and
add another installment to our backyard saga of life, death,
deceit, cunning, determination and strength.
</P>
<P>
   My son is a product of the new American divorce, a boy who knows
his way around airplanes, airports and the rules of carry-on
baggage. Three weeks is his allotted summer vacation time with me.
Three weeks to connect and then, just like that, disconnect, pack
the bag, make the bed, put away the Legos and pool toys until the
next time.
</P>
<P>
   His teenage sister, Mary, lives here, but the other, Georgia, is
in Paris for the summer studying art. It's the first summer she's
missed, and I miss her. In past years I started counting the hours
to their departure before their plane touched down. Now, I count
just Patrick's.
</P>
<P>
   So, when a family of cardinals set up house in a Chinese orchid
tree just below Patrick's bedroom window, I thought: This is nice.
This is stuff memories are made of. Cozy lessons about life will
devolve upon Patrick, I thought.
</P>
<P>
   First lesson: Birds die.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning Patrick flew in from Boston, three baby birds
squawked in the nest. We erected a stepladder about 10 feet from
the nest, so as not to bother the birds. Then we peeked. Every hour
thereafter Patrick had to climb the ladder to sneak a peek. The
next day he noticed the attrition.
</P>
<P>
   A bird is gone, Dad.
</P>
<P>
   These things happen, Pat.
</P>
<P>
   Find it, Dad.
</P>
<P>
   Late that night, with Patrick asleep upstairs, I sipped a coffee
and watched a rising full moon make long shadows in the yard. And
there on the pool deck, still warm from the afternoon sun, basked a
big rat snake. With a bulge in his belly.
</P>
<P>
   Up the ladder I went, with a flashlight. A look in the nest.
Another bird gone. Just one remained.
</P>
<P>
   I grabbed the long aluminum pool pole and jabbed the snake. It
wrapped itself around that pole in a perfect coil. A sailor
couldn't have done better. Then I launched it over the hedge into a
tall palmetto palm.
</P>
<P>
   One bird left. If that little puff ball went missing, I'd put a
fake bird in the nest.
</P>
<P>
   Next morning I told Patrick of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   From then on, he asked to check the remaining bird every
half-hour. I think he asked in his sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Then the grackles came, devious and cowardly devils that would
flee the tree as I stabbed at them with the long pole. Then they'd
circle back and come from the other side. For two days the grackles
came. Don't hurt them, Dad, said Patrick. Just make them go away.
</P>
<P>
   Then the mockingbirds. Brazen fellows. I lunged at them with the
pole and they'd step off their branches right onto the tip, as if
to say, thank you, now just drop us in yonder nest.
</P>
<P>
   Tree frogs. Do they eat birds? We consult the nature books.
Carpenter ants, curly-tailed lizards. The orchid tree was alive
with peril.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the thunderstorms. And who do we find on the wet
bricks under the nest after one deluge but the bird. It's hopping,
in a pathetic sort of way. Its parents are hopping mad.
</P>
<P>
   Build a nest, Dad. So we put the bird in a big, wicker dog bed
stuffed with leaves and Spanish moss.
</P>
<P>
   More rains the next day. The bird is a wet, quivering ball of
fuzz. I put an umbrella over the dog bed, but I'm sure the bird is
doomed.
</P>
<P>
   For three mornings running I dread the status check. But each
morning, there it is, dry and pouting for food. Patrick keeps his
distance, but he tells the bird everything will be OK. What does he
know?
</P>
<P>
   Then a couple of days later the bird hops up on the edge of the
dog bed. Its parents are across the yard, calling. The chick
flutters off the nest and begins stumbling across the yard with all
the grace of a drunk on a tilted sidewalk. The parents swoop down
and sweep the grass with their wings. The chick imitates them. He's
airborne. Maybe 2 inches high.
</P>
<P>
   The family disappears into the brush. We hear them for two days.
Three voices, one very high. Then, they're gone. Three weeks, start
to finish.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick packs his bag. He's leaving. The nest high in the tree
is empty. I don't look forward to seeing it sway in the fall winds.
I might take it out.
</P>
<P>
   Where's the bird, asks Patrick.
</P>
<P>
   Airborne, gone, growing up, seeing the world, I tell him.
</P>
<P>
   Just like Georgia in Paris, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Yup, just like your sister, I say.

 &HT;    At the plate, fear is always there
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every pitcher has the same best pitch.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a fastball, curve, slider or change.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a knuckler, split-finger, sinker or screwball.
</P>
<P>
   It's fear.
</P>
<P>
   It's every batter's thought _ no matter how deeply hidden _ that
what happened to Craig Counsell can happen to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The right side of Counsell's face was crushed by a pitch from
Houston reliever C.J. Nitkowski during the Marlins' 11-3 victory
Monday night at Pro Player Stadium. Counsell suffered a compound,
displaced fracture of the right mandible.
</P>
<P>
   Marlins team doctor Dan Kanell termed it a ``serious'' trauma
that was, in technical terms, a ``comminuted'' injury. Translation:
approximately an inch-and-a-half of Counsell's mandible was,
according to Kanell, ``shattered'' and ``splintered'' into ``a lot
of pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Counsell underwent oral and plastic surgery early Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   His jaw is wired shut.
</P>
<P>
   He will not eat solid food for five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He is on the 15-day disabled list, but will be allowed to resume
baseball activities in a month. Nobody, however, would be surprised
if the second baseman missed most or all of what remains of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Least of all Florida manager Jim Leyland, who answered the phone
in his office Tuesday afternoon and said, ``Our boy's pretty beat
up, isn't he?''
</P>
<P>
   Fear.
</P>
<P>
   Houston manager Larry Dierker, who won 137 games during his own
Major League pitching career, explained its rawness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The essence of baseball is the pitcher-hitter confrontation,''
Dierker said. ``Everything stems from it, and there's danger.''
</P>
<P>
   That danger is the seed from which fear grows. It is assumed as
part of the game in a process of simplification that allows players
to deal with the demons.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the day-after sympathy for Counsell, which was
expressed in tones of genuine concern, was coated in an
unmistakable coldness.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's Craig Biggio, Counsell's second base counterpart, was
beaned last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's different,'' Biggio said, ``but the bottom line is
you're going to have to get over it if you're going to survive ...
somebody's ready to take your job.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston's Jeff Bagwell, who has had a wrist broken three times
by pitches, expressed much the same sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``As unfortunate as it is, it's part of the game,'' he said.
``You have to put it behind you. If you don't, you have no chance
as a hitter. I was still nervous every time I came back, but I
finally sat myself down and decided it was time to get over it. You
have to forget about it.''
</P>
<P>
   And even Nitkowski, who called the Florida clubhouse after the
Monday night game and tried to check on Counsell's condition
throughout the day Tuesday, eventually was able to review the
situation with a certain objectivity. He admitted to being
``flustered and exhausted'' by the time he reached the hotel after
watching tapes of hitting Counsell, but wanted it resolved in his
own mind by the time he returned to the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In the Houston clubhouse, Nitkowski, a lefthander, demonstrated
the left-handed hitting Counsell's technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look closely, this is his first move,'' said Nitkowski,
dipping his right shoulder down from a batting stance meant to
imitate Counsell's style. ``He fouls a lot of balls off outside. I
thought if I threw a curve out there, he'd hook it to right. I was
trying to throw a fastball inside, but it got up.''
</P>
<P>
   And the unspoken fear became very real in the Monday night rain.
</P>
<P>
   It's always there.
</P>
<P>
   ``In high school, I hit the first kid I faced in the head ,''
Dierker said. ``They had to help him off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Counsell is expected to be released from Holy Cross Hospital in
Fort Lauderdale today, but what Leyland said was ``an awful noise''
will echo for a very long time.
</P>
<P>
   It is baseball's sound of fear.

 &HT;    Broken Sound suit a class action
 &HT;    By Paul Owers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ Homeowners in the Broken Sound development
have gained class-action status in their lawsuit against Arvida/JMB
Partners seeking control over the subdivision's recreational
facilities and a refund of the $40 million they've paid so to buy
the facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case presents the quintessential scenario for
class-action treatment,'' the 4th District Court of Appeal wrote in
a decision issued last week.
</P>
<P>
   Arvida/JMB has 15 days from the July 29 opinion to file for a
rehearing. The company has asked for an extension.
</P>
<P>
   The homeowners filed suit against Arvida/JMB in 1995, saying the
developer violated Boca Raton law by not giving them the golf
course, tennis courts and other recreational facilities _ including
the clubhouse, pool and exercise facilities _ in 1992, when
two-thirds of the development's homes were built. Arvida/JMB
continues to charge residents to use those amenities and, since
1992, has been selling ownership stakes in them.
</P>
<P>
   A representative for Broken Sound declined to disclose
membership fees. Larry Corman, an attorney for the homeowners, said
an annual tennis membership costs about $20,000, not including
additional annual dues. Broken Sound Club Inc., an entity
controlled by Arvida/JMB, runs the facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The residents also argue that Arvida/JMB agreed to ultimately
give up control of the recreational facilities when it sought
permission from the city to build the 1,600-home development along
Yamato Road.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get from Point A to Point B, and the class
action is the vehicle that we will use to make that journey,''
Corman said.
</P>
<P>
   The homeowners want to sue as a class because there are nearly
30 homeowner groups in Broken Sound, Corman said.
</P>
<P>
   Arvida/JMB contends that the Broken Sound amenities were
designed as an equity club that resident-members would own after a
certain number of memberships had been sold.
</P>
<P>
   John Baric, vice president and general counsel for Arvida/JMB,
said he is unsure what the exact number is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always intended to be an equity club,'' he said.
``That's the way it was presented to the city and to the residents.
There was never any attempt to hide that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some municipalities, such as Boca Raton, have laws governing how
planned unit developments can be established.
</P>
<P>
   Corman said turning over ownership of the recreational
facilities varies, depending on the developer.
</P>
<P>
   The case is set for trial in November.

 &HT;    Marion has designs for free safety
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ For the past couple years, the Miami Dolphins have
walked into their version of a living room _ you know, that
120-by-53-yard space with lush green carpeting _ and seen this ugly
hole against the far wall.
</P>
<P>
   Free safety.
</P>
<P>
   They tried Gene Atkins and Sean Hill there. They tested Shawn
Wooden there, then moved him to strong safety. They brought in
George Teague and Corey Harris. In two years, they used six
different starters. And none looked right.
</P>
<P>
   So who did they turn to in the offseason?
</P>
<P>
   Brock Marion, interior design major.
</P>
<P>
   OK, the real reason the Dolphins gave Marion, 28, a three-year,
$8.1 million deal probably has more to do with what he did after he
left the University of Nevada and became a seventh-round draft pick
in 1993 for the Dallas Cowboys and their coach, Jimmy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted him because we knew what kind of player he is,''
said Bob Ackles, Dolphins director of player personnel who was at
Dallas for Marion's rookie season. ``He's a leader. He knows how to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   He also knows how to decorate a room.
</P>
<P>
   Long before Marion became the kind of football player that the
Dolphins would consider counting on to make their secondary look
better, he was studying space and colors. And we're not talking
about the Red Zone.
</P>
<P>
   His favorite class at West High School in Bakersfield, Calif.,
was drafting. He liked working with the angles. Breaking down
space. Figuring out how things fit together.
</P>
<P>
   When he got to college and realized he didn't like his first
major, engineering, he went to his counselor and said, ``I like
drafting; what can I do?''
</P>
<P>
   The counselor suggested architecture. Or maybe interior design.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I got into it, I enjoyed it,'' he said. ``It's space
planning and decorating with colors. I've developed an eye for
color. I try to match everything, coordinate everything in everyday
life.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't finish his degree. He figures he has two years left.
And he plans to return to school once his football career is over.
</P>
<P>
   The motivation isn't money. It's about being able to give his
three children _ all under 5 years old _ a do-your-homework
lecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't sit there and preach to my kids about education if I
don't have a college degree myself,'' he said. ``You want to set an
example and say, `Daddy did it. Mommy did it. Now you have to do
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Marion and his wife, Keri, have battles over how to
decorate their house.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the time,'' he said with a laugh. ``She's more of a
traditional, old-fashioned type of woman who likes the rich colors,
the reds and cherries. I tend to let her do what she wants to do.
Then, I tell her, `No, that's not going to go.'''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't walk into teammates' homes and start playing Frank
Lloyd Wright. Not unless asked.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago Cowboys defensive back Darren Woodson took him
upstairs to a game room that Woodson was putting together and asked
what he thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Do you want my honest opinion?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He told Woodson to move a couch ``that just didn't go at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Marion smiles when asked about the dichotomy of football and
interior design.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it as once you get away from football, you've got to
have a sense of peace,'' he said. ``Football is not going to be
there the rest of my life. I could end my career at this
afternoon's practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that he plans to stop playing anytime soon. In fact, one of
the reasons he came to Miami was because of what he would be
working on. No carpeting. Just real grass that, he figures, should
allow his knees to last longer.
</P>
<P>
   The other reasons were the money _ ``an offer that you couldn't
refuse,'' he says _ and the chance to play for Johnson again.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Marion has made it in the NFL, you almost expect the
coach he first found him to say he knew all along this would
happen. Johnson, however, does not. He explains that when he made
Marion the 196th overall pick of the 1993 draft, he was looking at
someone who could help out on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``In college, he blocked something like 11 or 12 kicks,''
Johnson said. ``That was our No. 1 thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Kenny Gant got hurt. Gant had been part of the Cowboys'
nickel defense. Johnson decided to replace him with Marion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made plays all over the field and never left the lineup,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Marion became a starter in his third season, 1995, and made six
interceptions and 114 tackles. Still, when he became a restricted
free agent, the Cowboys made no effort to tie him up in a long-term
deal. They merely offered the minimum tender.
</P>
<P>
   And even after last season, when he made a career-high 158
tackles, the Cowboys showed little interest in getting in on the
bidding.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the deal was cut with Miami, they were nowhere around,''
Marion said. ``I couldn't for the life of me understand why. ... I
know I produced time and time again for Dallas. I don't have any
bitter feelings, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he seems happy to be in his new home, reuinited with his
old coach in a locker room painted in orange and aqua.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the color scheme of his new home, Marion
smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It flows,'' he said with a grin. ``It flows nicely.''

 &HT;    GNC's cuts in prices has Rexall stock diving
 &HT;    By Phil Galewitz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ Shares in high-flying Rexall Sundown Inc.
plunged 24 percent on Tuesday, August 4, after vitamin retail giant
General Nutrition Cos. said it was slashing prices to better
compete with discount chains.
</P>
<P>
   Several other large vitamin makers, such as Twinlab Corp. and
NBTY Inc., also saw shares tumble in heavy trading.
</P>
<P>
   Rexall Chief Executive Chris Nast said Wall Street was
overreacting to General Nutrition's pricing announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Rexall, which employs about 1,200 people at its Boca Raton
headquarters, prices its vitamins and nutritional supplements below
national brands such as GNC, and does not sell in GNC stores. Even
with GNC's plans to cut vitamin C and E as much as 40 percent, Nast
said Rexall will still offer lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with their discounting they won't come anywhere close. .
. . We'll still be dramatically lower,'' Nast said.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst John Mahoney of Raymond James estimates that GNC's
prices for popular vitamins and nutritional supplements are almost
twice that of Rexall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is: Is a price war breaking out in the
vitamins-supplements industry? The answer is yes, it broke out 2
1/2 years ago . . . and GNC just woke up to it,'' Mahoney said.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart started the price war, Mahoney said, when it doubled
shelf space for its own brand vitamins and the Rexall vitamins that
it sells.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney said the vitamin industry is growing at 20 percent a
year and companies that offer lower prices are best positioned to
reap the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident we will maintain our position as a leader in
the industry,'' Nast said.
</P>
<P>
   Rexall (Nasdaq: RXSD) has doubled its sales and profits several
times during the past six years, particularly by moving its goods
into mass retailers such as Wal-Mart and Kmart. GNC sells its
products only through 3,732 GNC stores.
</P>
<P>
   Investors apparently feared that GNC's price-cutting, while
great news for consumers, would erode profits for GNC. And if GNC
saw earnings cut, it might happen at other vitamin concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are looking at this and asking if it's going to be a
trend,'' said analyst Judy Meehan, of Parker Hunter Inc.
</P>
<P>
   After peaking at $38.38 last month, Rexall closed at $22.75
Tuesday, down $7.12 from Monday. That means Carl DeSantis, Rexall
chairman, and his son Damon DeSantis, company president, have seen
the value of their shares drop $457.9 million since last month's
peak. They own 29.3 million shares, or 43.1 percent of the company
stock, according to the latest proxy statement.
</P>
<P>
   Twinlab Corp., a maker of sports nutrition bars that Rexall
proposed to buy last year, fell $10.56 to $28.81. NBTY, another
vitamin maker, fell $2.31 to $13.94.
</P>
<P>
   Nast said the GNC changes should have no effect on the
fast-growing vitamin sector, which is buoyed by Americans' growing
interest in preventive health.
</P>
<P>
   Rexall's stock, which is now down 25 percent since Jan. 1, this
year, has rebounded before, most notably after a critical article
in Barron's financial weekly in 1997 sent the stock down.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, GNC's decision to cut prices is a result of
Rexall's success selling vitamins and herbals through mass
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   GNC said cuts it will begin cutting prices on a rotating basis
in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we look at where our strengths and weaknesses are versus
the mass market, the only that that's apparent on the weak side is
price,'' said GNC President William Watts.

THE GRILL TRANSCENDS BORDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ All the world's a flame.
</P>
<P>
   While the backyard barbecue is as American as baseball and Boy
Scouts, there may be no more universal custom than cooking food on
a grill.
</P>
<P>
   Yes indeed, all the world's a flame. From Argentina to Jamaica
to Morocco to Pakistan to Thailand to Japan and almost every
country in between grilling food is a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   While the setting and type of food being cooked changes from
culture to culture, the backyard barbecue is without a doubt as
international as soccer.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not convinced, listen to food writer Steve Raichlen.
He spent parts of each of the past five years traveling the globe
to study and just as importantly, to taste the grilling customs of
25 countries covering five continents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grilling is universal. Live-fire cooking in its most basic
form,'' Raichlen says, ``is done to some extent in every country in
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not approach this mission without a bias, as well as a
stomach he likens to ``cast iron.'' Raichlen, who lives in south
Florida and is the author of 16 books, including the Julia Child
Award-winning ``Miami Spice,'' is an unabashed fan of barbecued
dishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would maintain that there's no food in the world that
doesn't taste better grilled,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He knows whereof he speaks. Raichlen savored shrimp grilled on
ember-filled hubcaps in Vietnam and vegetables seared on infrared
gas grills in Tokyo. He visited steak houses in Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbecuing and grilling are more than just another technique
in a cook's repertoire,'' Raichlen says. ``Live-fire cooking is
even more than a cultural phenomenon. The world over, it's a way of
life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Barbecue! Bible'' is, in part, the saga of Raichlen's
journeys. It also provides hundreds of recipes, divided by subject,
not culture. In the chapter on lamb, for example, the selection of
dishes includes Capetown Lamb from South Africa, ``Onion Water''
lamb chops from Afghanistan and shish kebabs from Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the recipes feature introductions that are even more
interesting than the dishes the author tasted and chose to share in
his new book. These are the real gems, stories that open a window
onto the exotic customs Raichlen encountered.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as I love grilled food, and I don't know anyone who
loves it more than I do, for the purposes of this book I use
grilling as a prism to explore the many cultures I visited,'' he
explains. ``How we cook, and what we cook, often offers a great
deal of insight into who we are at least that's what I've found.''
</P>
<P>
   Raichlen introduced his book in late June at the annual
international Fancy Food Show in New York. He is quick to point out
that barbecuing and grilling are two distinctly different types of
cooking, although they are often (and incorrectly) used
interchageably.
</P>
<P>
   Barbecuing, as Raichlen describes it, is Texas-style slow
cooking, where the meat or vegetables are not exposed to direct
heat. The temperature should never go above 225 and smoke is a key
element with barbecue-style cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Grilling, on the other hand, is a high heat method with live
fire under the food. It is a quick-cooking technique, best when
used for steak, boneless chicken breasts or vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it would seem even the expert is inclined to use barbecuing
and grilling without distinction. Hence, the title of Raichlen's
book. No doubt ``Barbecue! Bible'' is a more pleasingly
alliterative name for a 556-page book than ``Grill! Guide.''
</P>
<P>
   But by far most of the countries Raichlen toured and tasted
grill their food, as opposed to barbecue-style cooking.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a testosterone component to live-fire food
preparation, not limited to the stereotype of Ozzie Nelson standing
over a backyard grill. According to Raichlen, the only countries in
which women do most of the grilling are Mexico and three Southeast
Asian nations, Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, grilling is not only universal it is also the oldest
form of cooking,'' Raichlen explains. ``Thousands and thousands of
years ago, well before ancient Greece, man learned how to control
the use of fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how grilling was discovered, through it was probably by
accident that fire was first used on meat. But it quickly became a
way of life, all over the world.''

   NEW YORK _ Attention mothers: If you could program your
daughter's life, which of the following options would you choose?
</P>
<P>
   A) Grow up in San Clemente, Calif.; graduate from Lewis and
Clark College; earn a master's degree in comparative literature at
the University of California at Santa Cruz; write articles and
essays for The Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, The Boston
Phoenix and Utne Reader; teach writing in Antioch University's
Master of Fine Arts program, and write books.
</P>
<P>
   B) Become a cleaning lady.
</P>
<P>
   Not much of a choice, you say? Well, what if she did both?
</P>

   Louise Rafkin has done so. She is the author of ``Other People's
Dirt: A Housecleaner's Curious Adventures'' (Algonquin Books of
Chapel Hill, 1998), and for eight years she has supported her
writing career by cleaning houses _ with her eyes wide open and a
notebook by her side.
</P>
<P>
   She knows when you've been bad or good _ bad when you leave your
toenail clippings lying around, very bad for firing her the day she
left two Cheerios in the sink. With an anthropologist's eye she can
look at an unmade bed or the contents of a garbage can and tell you
a person's life story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'm a modern-day Margaret Mead,'' she said. ``I just
don't have the money to get to the South Seas.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rafkin, who is 40, did get to New York recently from her
home outside San Francisco. True to the dual nature of her life,
she arrived at the SoHo Grand Hotel ready to analyze the detritus
from three recently departed visitors, before relaxing into Part
Two, being interviewed in the hotel dining room while reclining on
a banquette and eating lobster salad.
</P>
<P>
   First things first. She burst into the lobby a bit late, a whirl
of movement amid the black-clad clientele posed on the furniture.
She wore white overalls, a flowered shirt and red sneakers, looking
like an exceptionally hip plumber.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by two members of the hotel staff, one from
housekeeping, she entered the first room, which appeared to have
been hit by the proverbial hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would feel embarrassed to leave a room like this,'' Ms.
Rafkin exclaimed. ``They'd have my name on the register. They would
know who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   She took a quick look around. ``It was a woman,'' she said,
noting the blow-dryer still plugged into the wall and a bottle of
Finesse hairspray left behind. A package of Dunhills lies next to
the bed. ``There are only two gone,'' she noted. ``Her husband
doesn't want her to smoke, so she left the box here.''
</P>
<P>
   She peered into one of the wastebaskets. ``Red lipstick lady,''
she said, surveying a butt. She sorted through some slips of paper
on the desk. ``I'll just take these receipts and put them on my
expense account,'' she said jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   Holding up a Trish McEvoy bottle, Ms. Rafkin continued: ``She's
probably at least 40, and the alpha-hydroxy moment has hit her. And
look, more dental floss. She also threw out a really expensive
toothbrush she bothered to bring here and left a wooden-handled
razor.''
</P>
<P>
   She reached inside the third trash basket. ``I did just touch
dental floss,'' she said with a note of doom. She also found a
receipt for a skirt that cost $225, and another for a $350 coat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were evil and mean people, we could run their Amex
through, take their numbers and mess up people's lives,'' she said
of her colleagues, making that more recent household menace, the
nanny, seem suddenly benign. ``But we don't,'' she said
reassuringly. ``We're just intrigued by them.''
</P>
<P>
   The second room was pristine by comparison. A penny lay on the
floor, tail side up. The housekeeping staff member turned it over
so the head was up, transforming it into a good-luck charm for the
next person.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rafkin smiled in recognition; she has had her own moments
tangling with fate. In her book she writes of the time she found a
love letter taped to the back of a picture frame, unsealed and
addressed to a man she vaguely knew. It was a confession of love
from another man who had previously lived in the house but had long
since left town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't imagine how the letter had come to be stuck to the
back of the picture, or why it was there,'' she writes. At the end
of the letter, the man concluded: ``I hope someone will send this.
I am not brave enough to accept my passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rafkin mailed it. ``Sometimes I want my presence in a house
to have an effect beyond that of a well-mopped floor,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   Does she know what happened? No, she said as she headed to the
next room, smiling, seeming perfectly content at not knowing the
outcome. It is odd to realize that sometimes fate can be no more
cosmic than the cleaning lady's mailing a letter or turning a bad
penny into a good one on impulse. Suddenly that person with the
keys to your house, the one upon whom you graciously bestow your
old magazines, takes on a different dimension.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an old saying,'' Ms. Rafkin writes. ``A servant is a
master in disguise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the masters don't know it,'' she said, when reminded of
the line. ``That's the curious part.''
</P>
<P>
   The third room was the male equivalent of the first. Wet towels
were strewn across the floor with faxes and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ate the trail mix and had the tomato juice,'' Ms. Rafkin
noted, familiar by now with the contents of the minibar. He also
left a wad of red chewing gum on top of it. She wrinkled her nose
and walked to the desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, he left all his change,'' she said, eyeing the pile.
``He doesn't like nickels and pennies. They're for the little
people.'' In the trash, she found a schedule of telephone calls and
discovered he was an executive at a television network. She asked
the hotel staff members' permission to take the People magazine he
left behind, and they said yes. As she picked it up, she also
slipped the man's business card into her overall pocket. They
didn't notice.
</P>
<P>
   Her analysis finished, she headed for the dining room. Has she
considered her cleaning future, now that her employers, current and
prospective, will discover her penchant for playing Harriet the
Spy?
</P>
<P>
   She nodded, expecting the question. Part of her trip has
included a visit to Provincetown, Mass., where she lived for nine
years before moving west last fall. ``I went the other day to clean
to see if I still enjoy it, and I do,'' she said. ``I like to work.
Writing takes so long, and it's so un-task-oriented. I would love
to be able not to work, not so I could write, but so I could play
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rafkin said that her housecleaning fees range from $20 to
$50 an hour. Last fall she taught a writing class at the City
College of San Francisco, for which she was paid $15 an hour. Doing
less menial labor than cleaning _ say, working in a bookstore _
pays $7 an hour. ``I could not live on $7 an hour,'' she said
flatly. ``I'd have one latte and be done for the hour. I wanted to
write this book to show what artists have to do and who they
actually are.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Ms. Rafkin did a reading in Provincetown of
some of her writing on cleaning. ``The audience was the cleaned-for
and the cleaners, the artists and the patrons of the arts with
nothing keeping them apart,'' she said. ``It was almost like seeing
a light bulb, the way the one started looking at the other. Now
they see us, I thought, and it started me thinking about a book.''
</P>
<P>
   Many artists wait tables, of course, and Ms. Rafkin has, too.
``For years,'' she said. ``Chez Panisse offered me a job. They have
a wine list with 200 wines I'd have to learn. Do I care if
something is woodsy?'' She made a face.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she has found another line of work she actually enjoys:
cater waitering. ``Every event has a story,'' she said. ``At one
wedding the old girlfriend showed up, and the bride threw her veil
out the window. It was great. My personal life is so unexciting by
comparison. I'm working on a piece now called `Always a Cater
Waiter, Never a Bride.' You walk away with a wad of dough and a
story.''
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing in Ms. Rafkin's own story that would have
foreshadowed her life's taking such an unexpected turn. Named Kathy
Louise Rafkin at birth, she dropped her first name during college
registration. ``I had never heard of a writer named Kathy _ that
was my cheerleading name,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not rich growing up,'' she went on, though her parents
employed a cleaning lady, as did everyone else in their San
Clemente neighborhood. Her father was a part-time pharmacist and
died when she was 17. Her mother became a marine ecologist, and at
77 she is still working.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of writing ``Other People's Dirt,'' Ms. Rafkin
returned to California to talk to her own family's Mexican
housekeeper, who made no effort to hide her dismay at Ms. Rafkin's
choice of employment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That American-dream thing was her life,'' Ms. Rafkin said
easily. ``Her son became a policeman. They wanted to assimilate, do
what was expected. For her, it was not an easy life. But I'm making
free money to live another life.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of which is writing about mess as metaphor, a subject she
warms to. ``Being messy is human,'' she said. ``The more people
there are in your life, the bigger the mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Which also goes for pets, she said, including her own dog, Lucy.
``If I didn't have her, I wouldn't have to vacuum every day, but
then I wouldn't have Lucy. People I know with the cleanest houses,
it's a sad, sad thing. But that's their choice. No mess, no love,
no people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rafkin decided against telling most of her cleaning clients
about her writing career. ``That was the challenge,'' she said,
``being in these houses, never being asked anything, not even my
name. There was that ego moment, sure, but then I would think: Does
it really matter if they know?'' As for the few people she refers
to by nickname in the book, she said, ``I doubt they would
recognize themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Did she set any boundaries when it came to privacy? ``I saw
journals and never read them,'' she said. ``I don't do that. But
once I taped together a breakup note from the trash. They had been
married 30 years, and it was a very beautiful human artifact that
would be thrown away otherwise. It's not like I did it to show my
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the final question of the day: What exactly
was she planning to do with that television executive's business
card? Will she call him?
</P>
<P>
   She colored slightly, and shook her head. ``I would never do
that, because I could get the housekeepers at the hotel in
trouble,'' she said. ``But I have friends who are getting into show
business now, so I thought I'd tell them his name and see if maybe
they've heard of him.'' She shrugged, and smiled in spite of
herself. ``I'd just like to know.''

`JACOB'S LADDER': A SWEET WORLD AND THE HORROR THAT KEPT IT GOING 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the opening of Donald McCaig's captivating Civil War novel,
``Jacob's Ladder,'' a young woman is ringing doorbells on a hot
August day in Richmond, Va. She is looking for former slaves who
have agreed to be interviewed for President Franklin Roosevelt's
Works Progress Administration.
</P>
<P>
   At the door of 376 Clay St., the young woman is greeted by a
servant, ``elderly, black, hunched,'' wearing a faded housedress.
``Are you Marguerite?'' the young woman asks. ``No'm, I ain't. I'se
Kizzy. Miss Marguerite inside.'' Inside, over tea, Miss Marguerite
turns out to be ancient, the size of a 10-year-old child, with
yellowish-gray skin, ``like medieval parchment.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the young woman asks her if Kizzy has been with her family
long, Marguerite replies: ``Patience, child. As you grow older, you
will appreciate its merits. After my son finished Harvard, he went
West. Los Angeles. I intended him to stay in Richmond with the
bank, but try and tell him anything. My grandson Joshua does
something with the Los Angeles Water Authority. What do you know
about water authorities?''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Can this be a former slave speaking? Yes, it can, and thereby
hangs a fascinating tale of course. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is a tale whose roots McCaig discovered while researching
county records for his nonfiction book about settling in Virginia,
``An American Homeplace.'' As he explains in his acknowledgments at
the end of ``Jacob's Ladder,'' he came across an ``evocative court
case'' describing a young couple, Alexander and Sallie Kirkpatrick,
who were convicted for harboring Jesse, a runaway slave belonging
to Samuel Gatewood, a neighboring plantation owner. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing the names of these principals, McCaig has invented
characters for them, as well as a constellation of individuals
around them to represent key points of view in Virginia's
experience of the Civil War. Among these are other runaway slaves,
plantation hands, young men who fight for the army of Virginia,
young women who tend the wounded in hospitals and a blockade runner
who contrasts starkly with Rhett Butler in ``Gone With the Wind.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most significantly, McCaig imagines why Jesse, treated so
liberally by the Gatewoods that he has learned to read and write,
became determined to run away. The reason is that Gatewood's son,
Duncan, has fallen in love and conceived a child with his mother's
personal servant, Midge, an unusually clever and attractive young
woman. This so upsets Duncan's father that he forces Midge to marry
Jesse, who loves her as much as Duncan does.
</P>
<P>
   But when Duncan comes home for the Christmas holidays from
Virginia Military Institute, he continues to be smitten with Midge
and begs that their child be reared ``as his in the house.''
Enraged, his father decides to turn Midge and the baby over to the
local slave trader. Jesse, in despair, goes on the run.
</P>
<P>
   It is not giving too much away to reveal that Midge grows up to
be Marguerite, the old lady who proceeds to narrate for the young
WPA interviewer both the foregoing events and McCaig's version of
the Civil War. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although Marguerite's all-knowingness takes a little getting
used to, her account catches you up so completely that you have no
trouble at all keeping at least a dozen characters straight and
following some six intertwining narratives. Of course some are more
absorbing than others, but what makes them all work well is the
elliptical way McCaig jumps in and out of the story, sometimes
merely hinting at what is about to happen, at other times picking
up the thread after a significant occurrence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This combined with the striking realism of the dialogue and
historical detail creates a paradoxically simultaneous distance and
immediacy, as if we were looking at the distant past through a
powerful telescope. In his acknowledgments, the author confesses to
having gleaned his material from memoirs, diaries and letters.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is his novelist's imagination (which produced his
charming border collie fictions ``Nop's Trials'' and ``Nop's
Hope'') that enlivens his harrowing battle scenes, his damning
portrait of Alexander Kirkpatrick, one of the most unpleasant
intellectuals since Lt. Tom Keefer in ``The Caine Mutiny,'' and a
glorious set piece in which a group of black soldiers react to a
newspaper transcript of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. (``Jesse, are
we `the people'?'' ``Not yet.'')  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One challenge to McCaig was understanding what the South had
fought for, which ``as a liberal, reared in the North,'' had always
puzzled him so much that his first working title was ``The Worst
Cause.''
</P>
<P>
   But after settling on a farm in Virginia he came to feel
something that made him better understand the cause. Whatever that
something is, he manages to convey both the sweetness of antebellum
plantation life and the horror of its peculiar institution. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So he ended up with the title ``Jacob's Ladder,'' which refers
all at once to Jacob's vision of God in Genesis, to the spiritual
``We Are Climbing Jacob's Ladder,'' sung by black troops around a
campfire in the novel, and presumably to the obstacles that
Marguerite's baby, whom she names Jacob, faces in his life.
</P>
<P>
   The question of how he climbs his particular ladder is never
precisely answered in the story. But you are always aware of the
question, and its presence serves as yet one more element enriching
this deceptively resonant and layered saga.

TOMALES BAY SHELLFISH INDUSTRY BACK IN BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Tomales Bay commercial shellfish industry,
armed with a clean bill of health from the California Department of
Health Services, is back in full swing.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the department lifted the ban on the harvesting of
oysters and other shellfish in the mid-and outer portions of the
Tomales Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The ban was imposed on May 15 after several cases of illness
attributable to eating raw Tomales Bay oysters were reported. The
total eventually reached 171.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Health Services spokesman Ken August said
extensive testing revealed that the illness was caused by a
``Norwalk-type virus, associated with human sewage.''
</P>
<P>
   The likely sources of contamination were ``either failing septic
tanks near the bay or overboard discharges from boats or other
recreational uses related to the bay,'' August said.
</P>
<P>
   On June 9, the ban on oyster and other shellfish harvesting in
inner Tomales Bay was lifted. But the department conducted more
tests of the mid- and outer bay on June 12 and July 13, both of
which had negative results, and maintained that portion of the ban.
</P>
<P>
   August said that his department would continue to watch Tomales
Bay closely. The San Francisco Regional Water Quality Control Board
and Marin County also have both pledged to make an aggressive
effort to eliminate potential sources of human sewage contamination
from the bay, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tomales Bay oysters account for more than 80 percent of Marin
County's shellfish industry, which yield $2.5 million per year. The
bay is regarded as one of the cleanest bodies of water along the
Pacific Coast, in part because its shallow opening to the sea
precludes the entry of deep-draft vessels.

NEW VOLVO S80 COMBINES LUXURY AND SAFETY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget ``boxy,'' put ``utilitarian'' and ``practical'' out of
your mind and get ready to change almost all your perceptions about
the venerable Volvo.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the all-new, awe-inspiring, way-cool Volvo S80 sedan,
the biggest and best and least Volvo-looking Volvo of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Due in dealer showrooms as early as mid-September, this new
front-drive, full-size sedan will a) alienate some Volvo diehards
who think boxy is just the thing, and b) draw a whole lot of new
buyers into the Volvo fold, people who just couldn't bear to buy
the type of car associated with middle-age mothers.
</P>
<P>
   The S80, with a price range of $40,000 to $43,000, will be the
most expensive production Volvo ever. But anyone who drives the
vehicle will immediately put it in the same class as European
luxury cars such as the BMW 5-series, Mercedes-Benz E-class and the
Audi A6.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo has gone upscale with this car, and you can bet it will be
a force in the marketplace even against such heady competition.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   That's easy. Take Volvo's long-standing reputation for safety,
quality and longevity, add a full measure of luxury, and you've got
a package that the consumer in the $40,000-sedan class has been
yearning for.
</P>
<P>
   Safety, which has always been Volvo's primary focus, takes no
back seat in the new S80. This car is, without a doubt, the safest
Volvo ever built, thanks to innovations including computerized
stability and traction control, advanced antilock braking, new
seats that offer much-improved whiplash protection in rear-end
crashes, and the ``inflatable curtain,'' Volvo's version of the
side airbag system to protect the driver and front passenger in the
event of a T-bone collision.
</P>
<P>
   Although Volvo will offer the S80 with seven different engines,
including two inline six-cylinders and five five-cylinders, only
the six-cylinders will be sold in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The top-of-the-line engine will be the T6, a 2.8-liter, inline
six-cylinder with double turbochargers, rated at a whopping 272
horsepower. This engine's power is on par with that of 4-liter V-8s
in competitive makes and Volvo will also sell the vehicle with a
five-speed manual transmission.
</P>
<P>
   A General Motors four-speed automatic is standard for Volvos
with six-cylinder engines, and will be the one most buyers choose.
It is so smooth-shifting that it's virtually seamless.
</P>
<P>
   The second engine destined for the U.S. market will be a
normally aspirated (non-turbo) 2.9-liter inline six-cylinder rated
at 204 horsepower. This engine is expected to be the biggest
seller; from my experience, this has all the power most buyers will
ever need.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers will enjoy the ride in the S80 almost as much as the
driver enjoys driving it. It's smooth and cushy but with enough
road feel left to give the driver some fun on curves and turns. The
rear seat is roomy enough for three adults to ride comfortably,
even on long trips, and the front bucket seats are so comfy you may
want to order a couple for your living room.
</P>
<P>
   The S80's distinct, modern design copies no other vehicle, yet
it looks as contemporary as any of its competition from Europe or
Japan. The design is the product of Volvo's California studio, led
by U.S. designer Doug Frasher.
</P>
<P>
   Production of the S80 is under way at Volvo's plant in
Gothenburg, Sweden. The official on-sale date is Oct. 12, but
dealers are taking orders, Volvo officials said.
</P>
<P>
   This vehicle is so important for Volvo's future _ the company's
first serious attempt to built a prestige vehicle based on the
traditional Volvo safety and durability _ that about 25,000 dealers
and Volvo employees from around the world have been brought to the
Gothenburg headquarters during the past several weeks to learn
about the S80, according to officials of Volvo Cars of North
America.
</P>
<P>
   NEW FORD MINI-SUV: Ford plans to introduce an all-new compact
sport-utility vehicle for model year 2001 that will compete against
the Toyota RAV4, Kia Sportage and Honda CR-V.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller than the midsize Explorer, the new model will be built
in Claycomo, Mo., where Ford makes Contour and Mercury Mystique
compact sedans. Production of those slow-selling vehicles _ if they
are still on the market by then _ will be transferred to Mexico,
the company says.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's Japanese partner Mazda will sell its own version of the
new sport-utility, the first SUV model shared with Ford since the
Mazda Navajo, a two-door version of the Explorer, was discontinued
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   AT A GLANCE: 1999 Volvo S80 sedan
</P>
<P>
   THE PACKAGE: Full-size, four-door, five-passenger, inline
six-cylinder- powered, front-drive sedan, an all-new vehicle that
will serve as Volvo's flagship car around the world.
</P>
<P>
   HIGHLIGHTS: Outstanding safety, quality and Volvo dependability
in a design that breaks the boxy Volvo mold; high-performance
turbocharged engine is optional; excellent ride and handling; roomy
interior; lots of convenience features.
</P>
<P>
   NEGATIVES: No station-wagon version is planned. Major
competitors: BMW 5-series, Mercedes-Benz E-class, Lexus GS 300,
Saab 9-5, Audi A- 6, Acura 3.5 TL.
</P>
<P>
   EPA FUEL ECONOMY: Not available.
</P>
<P>
   PRICE RANGE, WELL-EQUIPPED: $40,000 to $43,000 plus
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE ROAD RATING: A-plus.

   ``Sweet Dream Pie''
</P>

   Author: Audrey Wood
</P>

   People say there are children walking around this Earth who
don't have a sweet tooth. They shrug at cookies and cakes. Scorn
jellybeans and suckers. I guess it could be so, but I've never met
one. At least not in my family.
</P>
<P>
   My three sank their teeth into Audrey Wood's ``Sweet Dream Pie''
one night. The next night, they asked for seconds. And much like
the salivating residents of Willobee Street in the book, they would
have gone back for thirds, fourths and, most likely, fifths.
</P>
<P>
   Ma and Pa Brindle look like anybody's grandparents, comfortably
gray, comfortably round. Early one morning, Pa begs Ma to unpack
the oversize kitchen utensils packed away in the attic, the special
ones used only to make Sweet Dream Pie. Pa has one of those sweet
tooths I'm so familiar with, and every few years or so, it flares
up.
</P>
<P>
   As Ma and Pa slave away in the kitchen, the neighborhood falls
under the spell of the pie. That evening, after everyone's picked
at their dinners, the fun really begins.
</P>
<P>
   The illustrations by Mark Teague, who also illustrated Wood's
``The Flying Dragon Room,'' are simply yummy. Bring your own fork.

BRASS: IT'S NO LONGER THE TOP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)  (lb) 
 By TRACIE ROZHON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There's a reason those hotshot 1980s real-estate
developers were called brassy.
</P>
<P>
   They used a lot of brass.
</P>
<P>
   But for a lot of people these days, brass has no class.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we're more refined, more restrained,'' said William Lie
Zeckendorf, of the development family. Brass is out. Polished or
brushed nickel is in. In the company's 1920s-style
limestone-and-brick condominium rising at 515 Park Ave., only
nickel will be used in the bathrooms. ``If you look at the great
1920s apartment buildings, it's all nickel-plate,'' he said. ``It's
less shiny.''
</P>
<P>
   In another new tower _ at an unannounced location in the East
60s _ shine is also out. ``We won't be using a glitzy,
polished-brass marquee,'' said Robert Skolnick, development
director for Jack Parker Corp. ``We'll be using a dark green or
dark gray canvas awning, just like you see on Park or Fifth Avenue,
something that doesn't scream: `Hey, look at me!'''
</P>
<P>
   As new money copies old money, there's only one thing new
tenants like to see polished: their doorman's buttons. And
developers are getting the message. Whether they're putting up
mega-story, superluxury condominium buildings or fancy rentals,
developers are now taking up, with their customary vengeance, what
decorators and style-setters have been using in their widely
publicized homes for years.
</P>
<P>
   When Martha Stewart puts an article on replating antique nickel
faucets in her magazine _ as she did four years ago _ the consumer,
not to mention the real-estate developer, can't be far behind. John
Saladino, an interior designer known for his understated look _ and
his millionaire customers _ agrees that brass is outre.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has been using nickel faucets for decades _ at
first, he had to have them custom-made _ he acknowledged a
widespread trend towards silver metals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically a reaction against the often bright choices of
the 1980s when all of Wall Street put brass on everything that
didn't move,'' he said. ``And the brass was rarely solid brass. It
was plated, and it betrayed itself in four years or so.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the past five years, the use of nickel and stainless
steel has become rampant. Stainless now blankets counter tops and
appliances. Apartment owners who stripped the paint off their 1920s
metal door frames were surprised to find steel with the warm look
(and even the tiny dents) of old Mexican jewelry. They asked how
they could keep it without rust; lacquering it was the answer. A
few years ago, design mavens _ again publicized by Ms. Stewart _
started buying dental cabinets in stainless steel, old and new.
</P>
<P>
   It was institutional _ but institutional with a patina.
</P>
<P>
   And now, for the first time since the go-go 1980s, sales of
brass faucets by the United States' largest manufacturers, Kohler
and American Standard, have been eclipsed by chrome and nickel
fixtures. And inspired by the very high-end success of the English
company, Czech &AMP; Speake, the American companies began to develop
the nickel fixtures in old-fashioned styles.
</P>
<P>
   At American Standard, the nickel faucets were introduced only a
year ago. In the first six months of 1998, sales more than doubled
over the last six months of 1997, according to David Lipkin, vice
president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Lipkin called the growth spurt ``the most astounding I've ever
seen.'' In just one year, brushed nickel has grown to 12 percent of
the company's total faucet business, about the same percentage as
brass. Sales of chrome faucets are up 17 percent over the last
three years, while brass has risen only 1 percent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At Waterworks, a manufacturer and retailer of a whole line of
indulgently expensive bath and kitchen fittings, based in Danbury,
Conn., nickel far outsells other finishes, said Elana Cooper, the
director of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nickel has a jewelry feeling,'' Ms. Cooper said. In the
kitchen, she added, brushed nickel _ not polished _ is a big seller
because it most closely matches the stainless steel that is so
popular for sinks. The prices of brushed or polished nickel
fixtures are actually about the same as those for brass. At
Waterworks, an old-fashioned exposed shower with a gutsy round head
costs $1,150 in chrome, $1,381 in brass and $1,381 in nickel.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cooper, among others, credits the vogue for art deco
fixtures, often found at flea markets, as the reason that
manufacturers began to produce faucets resembling those of the
1920s and 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   The real art deco fixtures, with their chunky, silvery
silhouettes and cross-bar handles, can be found at places like
Urban Archaeology in Manhattan and United Wrecking in Stamford,
Conn. The antique faucets, especially English ones, are the horror
of plumbers, because of their out-of-date parts and differing pipe
sizes.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the manufacturers cite not only changing style
but practicality. They say there is buyer resistance to both modern
and restored brass because it's hard to maintain: It peels, it
flakes _ and household detergents can wreck it.
</P>
<P>
   For those who insist on brass, the big companies are coming out
with a new look, really a brass-colored finish on chrome. Kohler
calls it Vibrant; at American Standard the new finish will be
phased in by late September. The new brasslike faucets will come
with a lifetime warranty.
</P>
<P>
   But for the developers _ and a lot of their clients _
practicality is not the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brass is glitz,'' said Skolnick, whose company put up the
Knickerbocker, a condominium building on East 72nd Street, whose
brochure is distinguished by its veddy, veddy English air, with
butlers turning on the ``taps'' _ chrome ones, of course. ``Brass
is a substitute for gold,'' he said, ``and we think people prefer
the more traditional look of chrome and nickel.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, one developer disagrees. To him, the brassy
look is still the one that sells.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Trump, who has sheathed whole buildings in bronze-colored
glass and trims them in glittering yellow metal, is dipping his toe
into the waters of the silveresque. At his Riverside South
development, now christened _ guess what? _ Trump Place, one of the
new towers has a stainless-steel marquee. But that building is the
one where apartments are for rent. The other marquee _ where the
apartments are for sale _ is brass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a great believer in highly polished brass and bronze,''
Trump said. ``It is a more expensive finish, and although it costs
much, much more to maintain, it ultimately looks better.''
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for faucets. At Trump International Hotel and
Tower, the Columbus Circle skyscraper clad in bronze glass, the
master bathrooms were done in brass, and what he called ``the
secondary baths'' in chrome. But at 610 Park Ave., the old hotel he
and his backers are turning into top-end condominiums, Trump used
neither brass nor steel at the entrance. His architects chose a
limestone finish.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's playing it safe.

REINCARNATION: A RESTORED PATH TO INNER PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MAC GRISWOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILL NECK, N.Y. _ In 1960, John P. and Jean Humes returned from
a trip to Japan with a life-size, made-in-Japan teahouse. They
erected it by an existing pond on their property here and cut paths
through the woods to it from their house above. Pretty and
unremarkable, the garden at first must have been like many similar
installations _ static, postcard-like copies of Japanese, French or
Italian gardens tucked into the corners of the private estates on
Long Island's North Shore, its Gold Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the John P. Humes Japanese Stroll Garden here is a
jade-green woodland retreat, open to the public and perfect for
August weekends. A visitor's internal temperature falls at once on
entering, thanks to the cool notes of a Japanese flute, the icy
music of a spring-fed waterfall, the thoughtful pace of a tea
ceremony and the shady walk _ first up and then down the hill.
</P>
<P>
   What is remarkable is that the Humes garden exists at all. Two
years after Humes' death in 1985, the garden opened to the public,
but by 1992 it was galloping back toward suburban woodland status,
because of a lack of visitors, inadequate staff and not enough
money. In 1993 the Garden Conservancy took over, and by 1997 more
than $200,000 was raised to restore the garden, which reopened in
the spring.
</P>
<P>
   The pond waterfall and its ledges were redesigned and rebuilt. A
stuccoed wall, as imperially old-looking after six damp months on
Long Island as any Japanese palace wall, was constructed to block
noise from nearby Oyster Bay Road. (Sabi, the natural patina on
stone surfaces, is highly prized in Japan.)
</P>
<P>
   The garden has become more than a green haven, however; it is a
sophisticated adaptation of Japanese thinking to an American site,
said Stephen Morrell, a garden designer who has worked in the
garden for 17 years, first for Mrs. and Mrs. Humes, then as the
part-time curator for six. A graduate of the New York Botanical
Garden School of Horticulture, Morrell was sent on study trips to
Japan twice by the Humeses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at garden design intent in Japan, you see it can
be adapted to any place,'' Morrell said. ``The Japanese gain
inspiration from some scenic feature in the landscape and then
distill and re-express it as a garden. Copying isn't what's going
on. Following their esthetic means using our natural landscape as
inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Mill Neck, a gentle Long Island hill becomes the
``mountain,'' a traditional feature in Japanese gardens; the pond,
a ``sea'' with a rocky shore. That shore could be one of Long
Island's occasional pebble beaches, but its smooth round stones
also evoke the memory of the great man-made rocky shore at the
Imperial Palace garden of Sento Gosho, in Kyoto, itself an echo of
a coastal stone beach north of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Humes garden, native trees like tulip poplar and
American beech are emphasized to refocus attention on the American
woodland. Unique features here are the scores of Japanese and
American plants, many strikingly similar, that are planted together
throughout.
</P>
<P>
   A whiff of summer-sweet perfume in August could be coming from
the American Clethra alnifolia, for instance, or from its close
cousin, the Japanese C. barbinervis. The huge existing number of
identical species and counterparts supports the continental-drift
or land-bridge theory, that America and Asia were once one
continent, with one flora.
</P>
<P>
   Morrell got the opportunity to rework the pathways around the
pond and teahouse when the acreage was doubled from two to four,
and the decision was made to transform the place into a public
garden. He began by turning the path system on its head to make it
accessible from the new parking lot at the bottom of the hill,
instead of from the house above.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the sequence follows the Buddhist path of enlightenment
more exactly, he explained, from a gathering of energy at the
bottom of the hill to make the walk to the top, and then a
distribution, flowing back down to the tea house. Always open, the
teahouse offers an ideal view of the pond and a place to sit on a
tatami floor mat in order to contemplate the whole experience.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike other Japanese gardens, the stroll garden is designed
for walking, not sitting. The austere 15th-century Zen tea garden _
with its graveled spaces and a minimum of tightly pruned shrubs and
trees _ was one inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Called a roji, or ``passageway,'' a tea garden prepares visitors
for the soul-clearing experience of the ceremony itself. On the
pathway to the teahouse where the ceremony takes place, the size
and position of each stepping stone concentrates a visitor's
attention on the simple but profound act of walking, an example of
the Zen way, where every daily act is an expression of the Buddha.
``Take life one step at a time,'' Morrell said.
</P>
<P>
   The walks of large Japanese landscape gardens like Katsura or
Shugakuin have been called ``mute musical pathways'' by Dr. Teiji
Itoh, the reigning Japanese garden expert. Those walks, and the one
here, orchestrate the visitor's experience on a larger scale.
</P>
<P>
   Tempo is set by stepping stone sequences where smaller stones
make for faster movement and a single large stone, big enough for
two feet, becomes a rest. At the Humes Stroll Garden, three
gateways and a number of arrangements of large stones at the
turning points along the paths mark the intervals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where the path contracts, it forces you to move more
quickly,'' Morrell said. ``And where it opens up, you pause, just
as you would naturally, to look at the view. The entire movement of
the path up the hill is a series of diagonals, which is like the
natural movement of climbing a mountain. It has its own rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   (italics)The John P. Humes Japanese Stroll Garden, 26 miles from
New York City, is open on weekends, 11:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., with a
$5 admission. Guided tours and tea ceremonies will take place on
Aug. 8 and 22; Shakuhachi flute playing on Aug. 15, and guided

 PRESERVING THE RANCH WHERE D.H. LAWRENCE LIVED

<P>
   SAN CRISTOBAL, N.M. _ The spectacular landscape that drew D.H.
Lawrence to live on a mountaintop here has not changed, but his
homestead is now at the center of a fledgling campaign already
christened ``Save the Lawrence Ranch.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 15 months he spent on 160 wooded acres here in the early
1920s, the writer was so happy that five years after his death in
1930, his widow, Frieda, had his remains disinterred from their
grave in Vence, France, cremated and returned here. Mrs. Lawrence,
who remarried and lived at the ranch, high in the Sangre de Cristo
Mountains, until her death in 1955, encased them in a concrete
memorial at the top of a winding path. Her grave is just outside
the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Since March, reports abounded among Lawrence scholars and fans
that the ranch with its memorial has deteriorated because of
neglect by its owner, the University of New Mexico. Frieda Lawrence
Ravagli bequeathed the ranch to the university, stipulating that
the property be used for educational, cultural and recreational
purposes and that the memorial be open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   In July, those reports drew more than 50 visitors here to take
in the view, inhale the thin air and inspect the premises, also
known as the Kiowa Ranch. They were at an international conference
convened in nearby Taos by the D.H. Lawrence Society of North
America.
</P>
<P>
   A report in The Dallas Morning News that called the state of
Lawrence's tomb ``appalling'' spread quickly through the Internet
and British newspapers. Hearing the dire news, officials of
Nottingham, England, Lawrence's hometown, clamored for the writer's
ashes to be sent to the city. ``If they cannot look after the
shrine over there, then it would be sensible to bring it back
here,'' The Guardian quoted the leader of the Nottingham City
Council, Graham Chapman, as saying.
</P>
<P>
   John Worthen, a Lawrence biographer and the director of the D.H.
Lawrence Center at Nottingham University, said, however, that
Lawrence despised Nottingham, as anyone knows who has read his
novel ``Sons and Lovers.'' Worthen was making his first visit to
the ranch here.
</P>
<P>
   When Lawrence's patron, Mabel Dodge Luhan, gave the ranch to the
writer, he gave her the original manuscript of ``Sons and Lovers''
in return so that he would not be obligated for her gift.
</P>
<P>
   Returning the author's ashes is also impractical, Worthen said.
Lawrence's wife mixed them into the concrete used to build the
memorial. She was fearful that some of his admirers might steal
them and scatter them across the ranch. ``To get him out would
require a military helicopter,'' Worthen said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary Howard, the acting secretary of the D.H. Lawrence
Society in Nottingham, also visited the ranch. She said that
although the Nottingham proposal was an honorable and serious
effort to promote tourism for the city, ``it's a storm in a
teacup.'' She continued, ``Someone got the impression that things
were not tidy here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Howard consulted members of the Lawrence family, including
Margaret Needham, the writer's 89-year-old niece. ``We all spoke
with the same voice: the ashes should stay where they are,'' Ms.
Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   Worthen, Ms. Howard and the other visitors were among the 250
academic and nonacademic fans of the author who attended the
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Lawrencians ambled through the three-room cabin that the
author rebuilt with his hands as a home for himself and his wife.
Lawrence Gamache, the president of the society and a retired
professor at the University of Ottawa, pointed out artifacts: the
author's battered suitcase, a threadbare blue jacket, a nondescript
hat and a tiny typewriter, a gift from his patron that the writer
hated.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept sending him the wrong ribbon,'' Gamache said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Outside North America, interest in Lawrence is ``more intense
than you would expect, given the question of political correctness,
social correctness,'' Gamache said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence's sexism and racism are ``very politically incorrect,''
said Lois Palken Rudnick, the author of ``Utopian Vistas: The Mabel
Dodge Luhan House and the American Counterculture.'' But he is a
much more complicated writer, she said. Generations that found
sexual liberation in his novel ``Lady Chatterley's Lover'' might
appreciate Lawrence's passion, but popular culture today values
irony and cynicism, she said. ``He's a hot writer in a cool
period,'' Ms. Rudnick said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Rudnick called the ranch ``a kind of pilgrimage
site.'' The Luhan house in Taos, unlike the ranch, is on the
National Register of Historic Places, and the conference
participants voted to support an effort to have the ranch also
designated a landmark.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the passage of time, the ranch has seen few alterations.
The shrine, the Lawrences' cabin and the pine tree under which
Lawrence often wrote are intact. To study the perspective she
wanted for her painting ``The Lawrence Tree,'' Georgia O'Keeffe lay
under the tall pine and looked up through its branches into the
night sky. The painting is in the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous links exist between Lawrence's life at the ranch and
his writings. He did sustained work here, Worthen said. Lawrence
revised ``Kangaroo,'' rewrote and completed the essays for
``Studies in Classic American Literature'' in a hard-hitting
``American'' style and wrote short stories set in New Mexico. These
include ``The Woman Who Rode Away,'' ``The Hopi Snake Dance'' and
``St. Mawr,'' in which Lawrence wrote of his surroundings, ``Ah! it
was beauty, beauty absolute, at any hour of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in his letters, Lawrence wrote that when he and his wife
left the ranch for extended periods, they protected furniture from
gnawing rats by hoisting it up to the ceiling on ropes. Lawrence's
testimony confirms visitors' complaints of rat droppings in the
shrine, Worthen said.
</P>
<P>
   The University of New Mexico seems to be responding to pressures
to improve conditions at the ranch. Rachel Maurer, a university
spokeswoman, said that the neglect was understandable, given that
the ranch is 150 miles from the main campus in Albuquerque. ``All
the publicity and attention has people thinking,'' she said.
``We've got this. We could lose it. How can we improve it? How can
we better link it to our academic mission?''
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    ANGLICAN BISHOPS CONDEMN HOMOSEXUALITY, SAME-SEX MARRIAGE

   CANTERBURY, England _ Despite the pleas of American bishops
here, the world's Anglican leaders voted Wednesday to condemn
homosexuality as incompatible with Christianity, and end the
ordination of gays and recognition of same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution adopted at the Lambeth Conference here, the
once-a-decade gathering of Anglican bishops, is advisory but
nevertheless carries the heavy weight of orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been quite a difficult and painful debate,'' said the
Right Rev. George Carey, the archbishop of Canterbury, who
supported the resolution. ``I stand whole-heartedly with
traditional Anglican orthodoxy. ``I see no room in the Holy
Scripture or the entire Christian tradition for any sexual activity
outside of matrimony, husband and wife.''
</P>
<P>
   While the vote does not automatically invalidate the ministries
of gay priests, it should send a signal against ordaining more
practicing homosexuals, said Rev. Duncan Buchanan, the bishop of
Johannesburg, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who authored much of the resolution, acknowledged that
churches in different parts of the world have followed different
practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Church moves at different speeds,'' said Buchanan, who
noted that while ordaining gays has been accepted in the United
States it is forbidden in many parts of the world. ``We hope it
would get them to think carefully about it before moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the Episcopal church has about 2.5 million
members.
</P>
<P>
   The often passionate debate Wednesday laid bare a sharp division
within the church between bishops from the west, particularly North
America, and developing countries, particularly those in Africa.
While other issues have commanded the attention of the 800 bishops
gathered here in the heart of Anglicanism, none has fueled such
passion.
</P>
<P>
   Several African bishops professed views of the Bible that make
homosexuality a sin and expressed outrage that their colleagues
would condone it. ``As a Christian and leader in the church, I say
whoever has been caught in it has to repent,'' said the Rev. Wilson
Mutebi, the bishop of Mityana, Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   The African bishops said they had been gaining converts by
setting out a clear, consistent and conservative interpretation of
Christianity that does not bend easily to liberalizing forces. To
condone homosexuality would severely, perhaps fatally, undermine
their ministries, they argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Anglicans, it would be to commit evangelical
suicide,'' said Rev. Josiah Idowu-Pearson, bishop of Kaduna,
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   But Rev. Catherine Roskam, a bishop from New York, said any
action that excludes gays would have a similarly devastating effect
on her ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``To condemn it is evangelical suicide in my region,'' Roskam
said.
</P>
<P>
   She said opponents of homosexuality would win the votes in
Canterbury, but only at considerable expense to the church. ``It
will be a Pyrrhic victory, and we will have a divided church,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Byham, of Integrity, a gay rights lobby group, agreed that
even though the conference's resolutions are nonbinding they send
significant signals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that suggests that our churches are less than fully
open to membership of gay and lesbian people is a very bad
message,'' Byham said.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 526-to-70, with 45 abstentions, the bishops also
voted to:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Advocate abstinence for unmarried people.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Commit to ministering to homosexuals and listening to the
``experiences of homosexual people.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Condemn irrational fear of homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The vote also marks an historic shift in the church. For the
first time since these conferences began 130 years ago, the bishops
from England, North America and Australia are outnumbered by their
counterparts from Africa and Asia -- the continents to which so
many missionaries from the older churches were sent.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the center of power within the church is gradually
shifting toward the Southern Hemisphere, where views on issues such
as homosexuality are sharply different from those held in North
America.

LOS ANGELES LIFTS TAX ON HOME ARTISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously Wednesday to
rescind a requirement that writers and artists pay $25 for a city
permit before working out of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The Writers Guild of America, which represents Hollywood
screenwriters, sued the city last September for imposing a permit
system that it said violated the First Amendment and recalled the
``tyrannical and repressive'' registration system once used by the
Soviet Union and other communist countries to regulate writers.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Chick, the councilwoman from the San Fernando Valley who
sponsored the ordinance, initially defended it. But in May she
sponsored a measure to revoke the permit requirement and $25 fee.
Her aide, Karen Constine, said the later measure was introduced
because City Attorney James Hahn issued a formal opinion that cast
doubt on the constitutionality of requiring writers and other
creative artists to get permits before working in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan said he would sign the ordinance
rescinding the permit system.
</P>
<P>
   The vote Wednesday leaves intact other provisions in the city's
zoning laws that limit home occupations to activities that do not
intrude on residential values. For example, writers working on a
project that required employing associates could be fined and
ordered to move the activity to an area zoned for offices.
</P>
<P>
   But even as leaders of the nation's second largest city moved to
end the permit system, the Writers Guild said that efforts to
require writers, artists and others in creative occupations to get
approval from local officials appear to be increasing in Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank, a Los Angeles suburb, is considering a permit ordinance
similar to the one Los Angeles revoked, said Gary Bostwick, a
lawyer in Santa Monica who represents the guild. Several suburbs,
including Santa Monica and Long Beach, also have ordinances
requiring writers who work at home to get permits and pay fees.
</P>
<P>
   And Beverly Hills has an ordinance that not only requires
writers and artists to get a permit from the city but also requires
those who pay rent to get written permission from their landlord
before writing, painting or engaging in similar creative acts in
their residences. Mark Ryavec, the lobbyist for the Writers Guild,
said it had asked Beverly Hills planning officials to rescind these
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Ryavec said the Writers Guild expected final approval of a bill
in the California Legislature that would prohibit cities and
counties from requiring permits for writers, artists and others in
creative occupations working out of their homes and prohibiting
local officials from taxing such activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The City Council action removes one-third of the cause for our
lawsuit,'' Ryavec said. ``But until legislation is passed in
Sacramento, we will still be fighting the city's efforts to tax
writers who work at home, because this gets into issues of where
you did your work and thinking _ at your home in the city or your
weekend place in Big Bear Lake _ that we think are impermissible
intrusions on First Amendment activities.''
</P>
<P>
   The Writers Guild lawsuit, now in Los Angeles County Superior
Court, is being held in abeyance pending action by state lawmakers.

OPERA REVIEW: MILLER OFFERS A `MAGIC FLUTE' DEMYSTIFIED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. _ Here in the Land of Enchantment, the English
director Jonathan Miller is having none of it, or very little, in
his new production of Mozart's ``Magic Flute'' at the Santa Fe
Opera. ``More often than not,'' Miller writes in a program note,
the opera's `` `highlights' seem disappointingly vulgar, and
although a measure of bad taste is consistent with a work that was
written for a vaudeville theater, there is no excuse for some of
the excesses one sees.''
</P>
<P>
   So Miller reins in Mozart's creation, steeped as it is in
Masonic ritual, by setting it in a genteel hotel, post World War I.
An angular, cream-colored wall cuts the stage short in Roni Toren's
scenic design, and the male characters wear stiff evening dress,
though the females are decked out more fancifully in Judy Levin's
costumes.
</P>
<P>
   The fantastical serpent chasing Tamino at the outset is all a
nightmare, unseen by the audience. Tamino's trials by fire and
water evidently happen on other floors, also unglimpsed, though the
muzzling of his featherless friend Papageno and a few other bizarre
touches survive.
</P>
<P>
   With the work's action thus largely neutralized, the characters
are thrust forward, not always to happy effect. Indeed, while one
might on occasion expect, even embrace, a production from this
often brilliant director that seems utterly wrongheaded for all its
clever point-making (the Three Boys _ Girls here _ become
bellboys), what one does not expect is the trite and insipid humor
given the likes of Monostatos, played by Ryland Davies.
</P>
<P>
   In an evening so lacking in mystery, on Tuesday, the most
intriguing moment came with a power failure, seemingly Mozart's
revenge on Miller. Singers and orchestra, conducted by Robert
Spano, held the performance together through long moments of
darkness, and the Three Ladies showed fine spunk once the power was
restored, laying canny stress on the words ``magic power.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller based his text on Jeremy Sams' English translation, and
musically, at least, there was much to admire. Even without
birdcatcher trappings, Thomas Barrett was a dominating Papageno,
vocally as well as dramatically. Raymond Very was an appealing
Tamino, and Heidi Grant Murphy sang Pamina with a sweet, small
tone.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Richardson was an imposing Sarastro, but Jami Rogers
made the Queen of the Night's two arias sound at least as difficult
as they are. Spano kept the musical performance moving smartly
(alas, the tedious shtick of the spoken sections was out of his
hands) and drew a taut account from the orchestra and chorus.
</P>
<P>
   The other opera to follow the captivating American premiere of
Ingvar Lidholm's ``Dream Play,'' on Saturday, was Puccini's
``Madama Butterfly,'' on Monday evening. It has sentimental
significance for the Santa Fe Opera as the work that opened its new
theaters in 1957, 1968 and now, with the recent reconstruction,
1998, and it was conducted here by John Crosby, who founded the
company four decades ago and remains its general director.
</P>
<P>
   But in the event, this honorable revival of a John Copley
production from 1996 lacked a compelling presence. Miriam Gauci was
generally attractive in the title role, but Martin Thompson missed
whatever subtlety is to be found in the part of Pinkerton.

   Music, art and drama can pay huge intellectual dividends in
terms of a child's mental development, Blumenthal writes. Studies

their SATs and score higher on spatial IQ tests. Blumenthal offers

   More and more businesses are adopting policies that recognize
the problems parents have balancing work and family. But now these
family-friendly policies are igniting a backlash from childless
employees who feel resentful about what they perceive as more
favorable treatment of working parents. Harris looks at the
validity of these objections and suggests ways that employers can
treat both groups equitably. (slugged:

   High-fat diets and sedentary lifestyles are leading an
increasing number of children to tip the scales at far beyond their
ideal weight. Hours of playing videogames or watching television
instead of partaking in more physical activities are taking their
toll, Downey says. So is the decline of the family dinner hour.
Downey offers advice to parents on how to help children take off
those extra pounds. (slugged:

<P>
   Janice Ruell started worrying about when to send her third
child, Rosemary, to kindergarten even before the baby was born.
</P>
<P>
   Her first and second children had both arrived several weeks
later than expected, so when she went into labor in late August,
only a couple of days after her due date, Janice sat up on the
delivery table and shouted, ``She made the cutoff!''
</P>
<P>
   Five years later Rosemary's late-summer birthday did, in fact,
mean that she could begin kindergarten just as she turned 5, making
her one of the youngest kids in the class.
</P>
<P>
   Janice's older children had spring birthdays, and she couldn't
help but focus on the developmental differences between Rosemary
and her other children.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first two kids seemed further along in their intellectual
development when kindergarten came up,'' Janice recalls.
``Rosemary's sister wanted to go to kindergarten so badly that we
had to mark off each week on a calendar from her April birthday to
the first day of school, the following September. I was expecting
to see that same burning desire from Rosemary, but I've noticed
that she often has trouble thinking about the unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult for most parents to determine with absolute
certainty their children's readiness for kindergarten. Kids
approaching their fifth birthday can take large developmental
strides and acquire a good deal of self-confidence between spring
registration time and the first day of school at the end of the
summer. And the fact that parents get so much advice on the issue
can sometimes make the decision even more overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom is contradictory at best: ``It helps to
be the oldest in the class,'' ``You can get ahead if you start
younger,'' ``Keep young boys out a year,'' ``Children should be
able to tie their shoes, write their names and count up to 10.''
</P>
<P>
   How is a concerned parent to sort out the most important factors
in making the decision?
</P>
<P>
   The three kids described below had parents who reached different
conclusions about the timing of early schooling. Though the
decisions differed, they each led to a successful kindergarten
experience.
 &UR; ROSEMARY'S STORY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary's parents ultimately decided to send her to
kindergarten despite the fact that she was likely to be one of the
youngest kids in the class. Her father, Steve, didn't doubt
Rosemary's readiness for one second.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was so enthusiastic about learning,'' he says. ``I thought
we should take advantage of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary's mother eventually agreed and was happy about the
decision, which was also influenced by friends' experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost embarrassing,'' Janice admits, ``but there's a
certain social pressure on parents as well as children. Rosemary's
neighborhood friend has the same birthday, and her mother never
considered keeping her out of kindergarten for a year. Rosemary
would have been upset if her friend went to kindergarten and she
didn't. And I felt that Rosemary was as ready as her friend was.''
</P>
<P>
   Janice also talked to Rosemary's teachers at Chelmsford
Children's School, a private day-care and preschool program in
Chelmsford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all felt Rosemary was ready for kindergarten,'' says Dianne
Sadowski, Rosemary's preschool teacher. ``She had no difficulty
separating from her mother and father and showed a fair amount of
self-confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The teachers in Rosemary's preschool reassured her mother that
such social skills as communicating thoughts, listening, following
instructions, sharing and making transitions from one activity to
another are more important than mastery of the alphabet in helping
children to absorb what kindergarten has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rosemary started out the school year on the quiet side,'' her
Harrington Elementary School kindergarten teacher, Dora Bungard,
says. ``She was absorbing things, but she wasn't ready to volunteer
and share her knowledge. Then she went through this magical
transition that often happens in late winter, and now she is really
a class leader.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child learns classroom routines and develops a trusting
relationship with the teacher, she demonstrates increasing
confidence in her ability to master tasks in kindergarten. At the
same time, a child's large and small motor skills, attention span
and listening skills continue to develop.
</P>
<P>
   In Rosemary's case, the ``magical transition'' included an
increase in self-confidence and progress in her ability to handle
pencil and paper and perform other small motor tasks.
 &UR; NICHOLAS' STORY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is separation anxiety a reason to wait? Camille Lema, a mother
of two from Durham, Conn., opted to wait a year before sending her
son, Nicholas, who has a late-December birthday, to kindergarten.
Nicholas' parents made the decision mostly because he'd insisted
that his mother stay with him for a large part of the day during
his entire first year of preschool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Academically, he knew a lot, and he played well with others,
but he just didn't appear ready to move on,'' Camille says.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to separate confidently from parents is something
that develops over time at a child's own pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children who have the hardest time in kindergarten are the
ones with big separation anxiety,'' says Diane Kischell, director
of the Wesleyan University day-care and preschool in Middletown,
Conn. ``If they worry all day long, then they are not going to be
connected with the school process.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas' difficulties with separation indicated that the
demands of kindergarten, the school bus and a new setting would be
more than he could handle. At the end of his first preschool year,
he was still challenged by the experience.
</P>
<P>
   His parents' hunch that he wasn't ready for kindergarten was
shared by his preschool teacher, Kathy Meyering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicholas underwent a metamorphosis during his second year of
preschool,'' she recalls. ``He began to jump into the day and he
became very comfortable with his classmates, at times even taking a
leadership role in dramatic play.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas developed the ability to separate from his parents in
his own time. The way they supported him gave him the security and
confidence he needed to successfully negotiate kindergarten at
Brewster Elementary School a year later, at 5 years, 9 months. When
the first day of school finally rolled around, Nicholas was excited
to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a kind, sensitive boy,'' says Ann Rau, Nicholas'
kindergarten teacher. ``He came to our class with some strong
preacademic skills, but he never outgrew kindergarten by being a
little older.''
 &UR; ERIC'S STORY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With a mid-October birthday, Eric Wenz narrowly missed the Ohio
kindergarten cutoff date of Sept. 30. In the Kenston school
district, where the Wenz family lives, parents of children born
between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31 can apply for early kindergarten
entrance. Admission is based on a written application, a visit to
the child's preschool by elementary-school staff, an interview and
a series of standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   While most potential kindergartners are not required to go
through such an extensive entrance process, many school districts,
like Eric's, hold regular kindergarten screenings in early spring,
at which parents and children meet kindergarten teachers, speech
and language specialists, school nurses and other school personnel
who can help sort out various questions about readiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric showed some abilities that seemed far beyond his age, and
yet he's still a little boy,'' Eric's mother, Margie, says. ``His
emotional maturity was the biggest unknown for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The evaluation process for early admission was lengthy but
helpful, Margie says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric took it all in stride,'' she recalls. ``We could see him
becoming more and more confident, and by the time of his testing, I
knew he was ready. Now we have to get used to the idea of our last
child going off to school!''
 &UR; THE BOTTOM LINE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When to send a child to kindergarten can seem a momentous
decision to parents, who hope their child will feel secure,
confident and open to the learning experience. While many parents
may worry, the fact is that most healthy, age-eligible children
will thrive in a good kindergarten setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``A child who has been talked to, who has been questioned and
who has been given answers to questions, a child who has been read
to and who has learned to share and play with other children and to
take turns is more successful right from the beginning,'' says
Carol Aikenhead, past president of the Kindergarten Association of
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Five-year-old Rosemary knows the feeling of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like kindergarten, and I learn a lot of stuff,'' she says
enthusiastically. ``All of my new friends are here, and my teacher
smiles. When it is a kindergarten day, I feel happy.''

 c.1996 Family Circle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Mark Schubart was dean of New York's famed Juilliard School
of Music, he was visited in his office one day by a distraught
mother pulling along her little boy.
</P>
<P>
   What could she do about him? she asked. Here the boy was,
already 4 years old, and his piano repertoire consisted of only 34
pieces!
</P>
<P>
   Schubart, now chairman of the Lincoln Center Institute, which
trains teachers to use the arts to expand young minds, still shakes
his head over the encounter. Clearly, some people don't know when
to stop pushing their kids.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, parents with a more measured
appreciation of how to boost their children's learning power are
tuning in to a host of exciting new findings. Music, in particular,
is emerging as both a pathway and a stimulant to intellectual
growth.
</P>
<P>
   But the visual and dramatic arts can play a big role too, along
with other approaches that are revolutionizing childhood education.
On television, that master teacher ``Sesame Street'' has been
applying some of the latest research in maximizing youngsters'
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Watch carefully and you'll see how lessons on the same topics
are increasingly being clustered for reinforcement. The letter of
the day _ D _ might be shown in different ways: outlined in
candles, and then set to music in clay animation. Preschoolers who
have trouble grasping the lesson in a linguistic way may get it
through music or movement or other presentations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea,'' said Celia Genishi, chairwoman of curriculum and
development at Columbia University's Teachers College, ``is to give
children many different entry points for learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Driving all this is a new understanding of intelligence.
Increasingly, experts are redefining intelligence as more than
linguistic and mathematical ability, the traditional yardsticks.
Rather, they say, it takes many forms.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to specialists such as Howard Gardner, a professor of
education at Harvard who is widely credited with the theory of
multiple intelligences, and Daniel Goleman, author of the
best-selling book ``Emotional Intelligence'' (Bantam Books,
$19.95), our understanding of the workings and expression of
intelligence has widened.
</P>
<P>
   Now we include creative powers and the ability to understand
oneself and others along with the rest of the natural and spiritual
world, as well as the simple ability to get along with other
people.
 &UR; SEVEN KINDS OF INTELLIGENCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gardner makes a case for at least seven different intelligences:
linguistic (poet), logical-mathematical (scientist), musical
(composer), spatial (architect), bodily-kinesthetic (dancer,
athlete), interpersonal (salesman, teacher) and intrapersonal
(those with a highly developed sense of self).
</P>
<P>
   The implications of this expanded view of intelligence have been
sweeping. No longer must the label ``smart'' be reserved for the
best readers, writers and counters in the classroom. Now youngsters
who can follow complex dance steps or drum rhythms, organize games
or soothe conflicts with their schoolmates can be recognized as
possessing different types of intelligence. And these skills can be
utilized to learn the ever-crucial reading, writing and arithmetic.
</P>
<P>
   Although scientists are still struggling to understand the
developing brain, there is widespread agreement that the preschool
years open a mental window through which learning can flood in at a
rate never again duplicated in life. Opportunities not exploited at
this time can never be made up.
</P>
<P>
   Within the first four years of life, the child's brain grows to
fully two-thirds of its adult size, evolving at a faster rate than
it ever will again. And the stimulation present at that time will
have a lot to say about the kind of adult the child will become.
 &UR; WHAT PARENTS CAN DO &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In one famous 1960s experiment, scientists at the University of
California at Berkeley raised two groups of lab animals, one in a
setting of wheels and ladders and toys, the other in an
impoverished environment. After several months the animals in the
enriched setting not only were in better health and performed
better, but also had grown larger brains.
</P>
<P>
   So what can parents do to boost their children's learning power?
</P>
<P>
   + Expose them early to music and art.
</P>
<P>
   This should be done not in hopes of uncovering a prodigy, though
that may possibly happen, but because research has found links
between intellectual achievement and musical training and ability.
</P>
<P>
   How early? Well, some mothers-to-be make a point of listening to
Mozart and other soothing symphonists. Their hope is to predispose
their offspring to high culture, although science has yet to
confirm that this works.
</P>
<P>
   Because financially hard-pressed schools around the country have
cut arts programs left and right, parents have to do more to take
up the slack. Music lessons in piano or violin, two of the most
popular instruments for children to learn, can be started as early
as preschool.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some experts say it's almost never too soon to begin
and, for those with true talent, starting too late may mean never
fully exploiting their gifts. The idea is to train children so
early that their technique becomes intuitional.
</P>
<P>
   + Take children to live performances.
</P>
<P>
   There's no better way of exciting them about the arts. Give them
a good view of the conductor. Let them peer into the orchestra,
before or after the performance. Go backstage afterward if
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Many young people's theaters make a practice of letting the
actors in costume mingle with the audience after the curtain. Allow
time after the show for your kids to shake hands with the stars.
Or, for a look behind the scenes of a show or concert, try to
attend a dress rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   + Do dance exercises with young children at home.
</P>
<P>
   The urge to dance and move to rhythm is strong in many children.
Isadora Duncan liked to say she learned to dance in her mother's
womb.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from formal ballet and dance instruction, parents can put
on some music and have children dance or skip to the changing
rhythms. Ask them to imitate sailboats or gliding seagulls. Teach
beats with a makeshift drum.
</P>
<P>
   + At museums, look for ``please touch me'' exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing teaches children faster than hands-on experiences.
Children's museums are particularly rich in such fun, educational
displays.
</P>
<P>
   Many museums also offer children's art programs. Instructors
lead young visitors to a sculpture or painting gallery, talk a
little about the work on display and then give out paint, paper and
crayons with which the children try their own versions.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, parents can do similar things at home using art
books, art supplies and collage materials they have at hand _
anything from cut-up magazines and newspapers to old photos, pieces
of fabric and buttons.
</P>
<P>
   + Buy your child an inexpensive camera.
</P>
<P>
   Older children are often intrigued by photography. The pictures
they take can be developed inexpensively at neighborhood film
depots and used by parents as a springboard into discussions about
color and design: What makes some pictures nicer than others? How
does an artist pick a subject and angle?
</P>
<P>
   + Expose children to other languages at an early age.
</P>
<P>
   With their young brains programmed to soak up information at a
rate they will never achieve again, preschoolers can painlessly lay
the foundations for multilingualism. A foreign language that they
experience now will never sound completely strange to them again
and will be picked up much more quickly in later years.
</P>
<P>
   Research increasingly supports these recommendations. In one
recent study, four classes of first- and second-graders in West
Orange, N.J., were taught music using a highly structured and
demanding program pioneered 60 years ago by the Hungarian composer
Zoltan Kodaly. Their art instruction was also particularly
challenging. Four other classes took conventional music and art.
</P>
<P>
   After two years, the enriched classes had doubled the percentage
of pupils performing at grade level in math, to more than
three-quarters of the class. The other classes had lower gains.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits seem to endure. In profiles of test-takers, the
College Board found that those who studied or played music scored
an average of 51 points higher on the verbal portion of the SAT and
39 points higher on the math portion.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, at the University of California at Irvine,
psychologist Frances Rauscher and neuroscientist Gordon Shaw found
that preschoolers who took keyboard lessons for eight months
boosted their IQ scores on spatial tests by 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Rauscher and Shaw reported, college students
who listened to a Mozart sonata for 10 minutes performed better on
spatial IQ tests _ a benefit termed ``the Mozart effect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Music excites the inherent brain patterns and enhances their
use in complex reasoning tasks,'' the researchers concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The visual arts, too, pay intellectual dividends. Philip
Yenawine of Development Through Art, former director of education
for the Museum of Modern Art, reported that students who learned to
critically discuss paintings in a museum did better in social
studies and other subjects. They learned to formulate theorems,
draw meaning from abstract ideas and communicate thoughts. And
their writing improved.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nothing can turn off youngsters faster than forced
marches down endless museum corridors. One clever way of focusing
children's attention is to buy them postcards of works of art and
then challenge them to find the originals on the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Ask open-ended questions such as: What's happening in this
picture? What do you see in it?
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for any special answer _ just signs of thinking.
</P>

 READING AND LANGUAGE ARTS  
 &HT;    Reading Blaster: Ages 6-9. For reading-skills practice, you
can't go wrong with this space-age game show that teaches
comprehension, vocabulary, spelling and phonics through seven
different reading games and three printable storybooks. In Word
Zapper, youngsters dodge falling meteors as they scramble to build
words based on phonics sounds and spelling rules. In Get-a-Clue,
children read for meaning as they use their deductive reasoning to
solve mysteries. More than 2,000 words are presented, and the
program features nine levels of difficulty.
 &HT;    Runs on Windows/Mac. Knowledge Adventure, $30, ages 6 to 9.
 &HT;    Major League Reading. Sports fans can improve their reading

simulated baseball game. Kids control the plays by reading
curriculum-based articles and answering questions that test their
comprehension.
 &HT;    Runs on Windows/Mac. Sanctuary Woods, $29.95, ages 8 to 12.
 &HT;    Claris Works for Kids. While older kids can handle the adult
version of Claris Works, elementary-age children will enjoy hearing
their stories read aloud, learning about fractions by making their
own pie charts and creating multimedia book reports and
presentations with sounds and movie clips.
 &HT;    Runs on Windows/Mac. Claris Corp., $49, ages 5-11.
 MATH  
 &HT;    Algebra Smart. This entertaining game makes studying algebra fun

 By CHARLES DOWNEY  
 From Kiwanis magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Jimmy, a 6-year-old first-grader, should have weighed about 50
pounds but pressed the scales to the 95-pound mark. At his school
near Baton Rouge, La., the lumbering lad always was dead last in
gym-class activities and any sports he played with fellow students.
 &HT;    Because of the flabby rolls that hung over his pants, Jimmy
suffered all the cruel taunts other children could heap on a boy
who weighed almost twice the normal weight.
 &HT;    Eventually, his physician referred him to a weight-loss clinic,
the Committed to Kids Pediatric Weight Management Program at
Louisiana State University in New Orleans.
 &HT;    One of his first prescription slips read: ``Play outside twice a
week for 20 minutes.'' This could entail walking, bicycling,
in-line skating or other common childhood pastimes. At first, it
was difficult for him to huff and puff through those 20 minutes,
but he slowly improved.
 &HT;    Like Jimmy, most obese children live in industrialized nations,
but cases of childhood obesity are found worldwide. American kids
top the childhood heavyweight list: One in four children ages 5 to
12 is 70 percent or more over his or her proper weight, according
to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
 &HT;    Childhood obesity is partly caused by children being home alone
after school and snacking on whatever they want, as often as they
want. Also, more and more children have become couch potatoes who
routinely log four to six hours a day watching television or
playing video games.
 &HT;    Medical doctors, nutritionists and child-behavior specialists
are concerned about these trends, because obese children still are
growing and require certain nutrients for healthy physical and
mental development. Such growth may be stunted by high-fat diets
and sedentary lifestyles.
 &HT;    After a year at a weight-loss clinic, Jimmy worked up to doing
aerobic exercises and other physical activities for 45 minutes five
times a week. He _ along with his family _ also learned
much-improved nutritional habits and reduced his weight to 67
pounds.
 &HT;    But the big plus for Jimmy was constantly finishing first in
physical activities and sports at school. The cruel taunts stopped
when he began placing at the top.
 &HT;    Trading television for sports works, and many children need to
try it. The World Health Organization once surveyed Canadian
children and found that, outside school, the girls were active only
half an hour per week or less. One-fourth of the boys and girls
reported spending at least four hours a day in front of the tube.
 &HT;    ``We don't tell our young patients they must give up
television,'' says Uwe Blecker, medical director of the LSA
weight-loss clinic, ``but instead of watching television or playing
video games four hours a day, we ask them to reduce it to three. Or
we ask them to ride a stationary bike or walk on a treadmill while
watching television.''
 &HT;    It's all too easy for children to get their forks into one of
the biggest health hazards: fatty foods. Health professionals who
monitor the eating habits of young children have found that one
cheeseburger with fries can equal the total amount of fat a child
should consume in two days.
 &HT;    Children who must watch their weight are encouraged to consume
more whole grains, vegetables and fruits while cutting back on _
not eliminating _ dairy products, beef, pork, lamb and high-fat or
highly sugared treats.
 &HT;    Obesity has a genetic link. According to Canada's National
Institute of Nutrition in Ottawa, Ontario, if both parents tip the
scales at a normal weight, the probability of a child becoming
obese is about 10 percent. But if one parent is overweight, the
child's odds of matching that physical trait rise to 49 percent.
 &HT;    If both the mother and father are overweight, a child stands an
80 percent chance of becoming obese, due to a complex mix of
genetic and lifestyle factors that medical scientists don't fully
understand.
 &HT;    What medical science does understand about obesity is the
increased risk of more widespread health woes, such as the
development of diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis or skeletal
problems in hips and legs.
 &HT;    Studies reveal that portly children usually grow into pudgy
teens and adults. Each stage then brings its own woes. For
instance, University surveys and personality inventories show that,
as early as kindergarten, children have an aversion to obesity and
describe their overweight classmates as less likable, less capable
and less able to control themselves.
 &HT;    To curb childhood obesity, the American Pediatric Association
urges families to begin early with proper diets and exercise. When
overweight children learn to reduce and maintain weight through
good nutrition and exercise, the loss is more likely to be
permanent as they grow into young adulthood.
 &HT;    ``One of the primary causes of childhood obesity among our
patients is because families no longer sit down together for dinner
at a fixed time,'' says Baylor College's William Klish. ``Instead,
children eat in front of the television, after `grazing' all
afternoon. But when everybody in a family sits down for dinner at a
fixed time every night, fewer and healthier calories are consumed.
Also, today's children just don't play outside like they did in
years past.''
 &HT;    Families eat less when they eat together, because they talk and
that slows down the speed of eating, giving the stomach's fullness
signals a chance to work. Even small amounts of food will begin
sending satiety signals to the brain after about 20 minutes.
 &HT;    Children tend to lose weight more successfully when the entire
family is involved. Ideal loss for plump children is no more than
one-half to one pound per week.
 &HT;    ``When an overweight child starts watching the types of food he
or she eats, the rest of the family also must watch what they
eat,'' says Marilyn Day, a nutritionist at Children's Hospital in
Denver, Colo. ``It's unfair to forbid cookies and other treats to a
child while others in the home munch them.
 &HT;    ``I've found in my practice that a child often can lose unwanted
pounds through some very simple changes in ordinary foods that are
normally kept in the home,'' she adds. ``I've known children who
cut back from whole milk to skim milk or cut out the highly sugared
cola drinks and lost weight.''
 &HT;    Other researchers have uncovered an unexpected source of flab in
a study group of 168 children ages 2 to 5: fruit juice. In
Pediatrics, the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics, they
reported that children who drink at least 12 ounces of fruit juice
a day are more likely to be obese.
 &HT;    Young children worldwide are famous for being fussy eaters. More
than one serving of peas or spinach has ended up on the floor or
caused an evening-long power struggle between parents and children.
Studies have disclosed, however, that if caretakers introduce new
or more nutritious foods to young children too forcefully, it can
backfire.
 &HT;    Susan Johnson, an assistant professor of pediatrics at the
Center for Human Nutrition of the University of Colorado Health
Sciences Center in Denver, found in a study of 77 youngsters ages 3
to 5 that those children with the most body fat also had the most
controlling mothers.
 &HT;    Johnson notes that, though parents still are responsible for
making sure that children eat healthful food, the ``children
themselves are capable of figuring out how much to eat.''
 &HT;    Her advice about clean plates? ``Relax a little.''
 &HT;    The study revealed that children whose mothers allowed them to
be spontaneous about food _ to eat when they are hungry and not
necessarily finish all the food given to them _ showed a natural
instinct for regulating their own calories.
 &HT;    So there may be hope for caregivers trying to make vegetables _
and other unfamiliar but healthful food _ more popular with young
children. After all, if it leads to better health via an
appropriate weight, what harm is there in a few servings of peas
and spinach on the dining-room floor?

<TEXT>
<P>
   As an international relations student at Stanford University in
1982, Brad Howe often trolled the library stacks for the idle book
that would catch his interest. One day, he found a book that
changed his future.
</P>
<P>
   It was about Alexander Calder's mobiles and, as he tells it, it
inspired him to become a sculptor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They spoke so clearly to me that it made me want to respond,''
Howe said of the book's illustrations. ``I wanted to drop
everything and start making mobiles. I'm inspired by many artists
today, but the door to the art world was opened by Alexander
Calder.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, though, Howe and other mobile sculptors find themselves
in the odd position of having their works challenged by Calder's
estate. At its request, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art
plans to remove their mobiles from its gift shop during the major
Calder exhibition to be held there from Sept. 4 through Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Two other museums, the Whitney Museum of American Art in New
York and the Phillips Collection in Washington, have yanked mobiles
from their shops permanently, out of awareness of the estate's
concern that the public would not differentiate the objects from
Calder's work. The Whitney opened its new Calder gallery, which
features his famous ``Circus,'' in March, and the Phillips
currently has two Calder stabiles on loan from the artist's family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it offensive that the family of an artist would try to
prevent other artists from having access to the public,'' Howe
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Lerner, the lawyer for the estate, sees things
differently. ``These artists can go anywhere else,'' he said.
``During the period of the show, they'd be trading on the
reputation of Alexander Calder.''
</P>
<P>
   More fundamentally, though, the dispute raises the question of
whether the sculptural form shaped by Calder has been so identified
with him that those creating in his wake will forever be in the
position of having their originality questioned. It also cuts in
complicated ways at another issue: when a piece is so similar to
those of another artist that it infringes on a copyright.
</P>
<P>
   While Howe and other artists freely acknowledge they have drawn
from Calder's art, they say the end product is their own. Howe's
mobiles, for instance, use lime-green and pink _ shades not usually
associated with Calder's use of colors like red, black and blue.
``Calder created a vocabulary in kinetic sculpture,'' said Howe,
who lives in Los Angeles. ``My goal is not to create Calder. My
goal is to create kinetic sculpture that inspires.''
</P>
<P>
   The sentiment is one that gains a certain sympathy even at the
museums that have sided with the Calder estate. ``We are
sympathetic to the artist who feels his work is being displaced,''
said Lori Fogarty, the San Francisco museum's deputy director for
curatorial affairs. ``But ultimately we were more sympathetic to
the Calder family. When we are going to an artist's estate and
asking to borrow 100 works and relying on their generosity, we feel
very sympathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   The 270-work Calder retrospective, the first major showing of
his work since 1976, moves to the San Francisco museum after its
debut at the National Gallery of Art in Washington. More than
288,700 people attended the exhibition from March 29 to July 12,
said Deborah Ziska, a spokeswoman for the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fogarty said the Calder family's request to remove the
mobiles was included earlier this year with loan papers for the
show.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner said the sale of mobiles resembling Calder's during the
show would only confuse the public. Some visitors, he said, would
assume that the mobiles were reproductions licensed or endorsed by
the estate of Calder, who died in 1976. The estate does not usually
permit reproductions of Calder's mobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner said the estate did not intend to sue the mobile artists,
attempt to confiscate their works or prevent them from selling
elsewhere. ``We are bending over backward to be reasonable to
everybody,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Willard Holmes, the Whitney's acting director, said he had not
been asked directly to remove the gift-shop mobiles. ``We removed
those where we felt there was a legitimate concern they would cause
confusion in the visitor's mind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some museum officials say mobiles must meet certain esthetic
standards to be sold in their gift shops. ``There's a fine line
between fine arts and design objects,'' said Ms. Fogarty. ``For the
most part, our objects are very carefully selected. We don't sell
just any kind of design object.''

 By DIANE HARRIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It figures. Just as American employers finally appear to be
catching on to the need for family-friendly programs and policies,
a small but vocal group comes along that seems bent on taking those
hard-won benefits away.
 &HT;    Call it a backlash, but a growing number of childless workers
are protesting what they believe to be the inequity of benefits
designed to help working parents better balance the demands of
their personal and professional lives.
 &HT;    ``Programs and policies that exclude large groups of people are
inherently unfair,'' says warehouse-software manufacturer Ann
Price, a member of The Childfree Network, a Citrus Heights,
Calif.-based advocacy group that boasts 5,000 members nationwide.
``If I don't have kids, family-friendly benefits by definition
aren't very friendly to me.''
 &HT;    New research supports the notion that some childless workers
feel they are being stiffed by their employer's focus on the needs
of co-workers with kids. For instance, some 56 percent of work-life
professionals believe that childless workers harbor resentment
toward employees with children, according to a recent survey by The
Conference Board, a business-research group in New York.
 &HT;    ``Where people feel the most discrimination is around time _
having to stay late at the office, having to finish work at home,
not being able to attend to personal responsibilities,'' says
Marcia Brumit Kropf, a vice president with Catalyst, a women's
research and consulting firm in New York. ``The real problem is how
stretched everyone feels in the workplace today.''
 &HT;    With a view toward clearing the air, here is a closer look at
the most common complaints voiced by childless workers, along with
some expert thinking about what's legitimate about the gripes,
what's not and what companies and employees can do to insure a fair
deal for all workers, whether they are parents or not.
 &HT;    + It's a family-friendly world out there.
 &HT;    If only it were true.
 &HT;    ``Over the past five years there has been a sea change in
consciousness, a general recognition that helping employees balance
their professional and private lives is an important business
issue,'' Brumit Kropf says. ``But we have a lot of work left to do
to turn that consciousness into reality.''
 &HT;    In fact, while the range of possible benefits has expanded over
the past decade, the majority of employers have yet to get with the
program.
 &HT;    Consider: Only 37 percent of companies offer paid parental
leave, only 18 percent provide any form of child-care help, such as
an on-site child-care center or backup care, and a scant 12 percent
lend a hand with adoption expenses, according to a 1996 survey of
313 companies by Buck Consultants, a New York-based
benefits-consulting firm.
 &HT;    But while family-friendly programs are not as ubiquitous as
critics claim, a climate that is generally open to family concerns
is.
 &HT;    ``Companies tend to reflect a cultural attitude that views
raising children as a kind of sacred calling,'' says Mary Young, a
researcher at Boston University's School of Management. ``Having to
get home to your kids is a high card of sorts that is hard for a
childless employee to match.''
 &HT;    What would help: The most painful work-life conflict for
employees is to not be treated with respect or recognized as a
whole person with a compelling life off the job, concludes a new
study by human-resources consultant Marci Koblenz of MK Consultants
in Evanston, Ill. And that's as true for childless employees as it
is for working parents, Koblenz found.
 &HT;    Yet the language used to describe programs to help employees
achieve balance _ phrases such as ``family-friendly'' or
``work-family'' _ inadvertently fuels divisiveness by seeming to
exclude anyone who doesn't have kids.
 &HT;    To send a more inclusive message, a growing number of firms are
changing the name of their initiatives to more neutral titles, such
as ``work-life,'' indicating that such programs are intended to
help all employees resolve conflicts between their personal and
professional responsibilities, whether or not they have children.
 &HT;    + Childless workers pick up the slack for working moms and dads.
 &HT;    Three quarters of the work-life experts surveyed by The
Conference Board disputed the notion that employees without
children carry more than their fair share of the work load.
 &HT;    ``Sure, you occasionally hear stories about childless employees
staying until 10 at night to make up the work left behind by a
working parent,'' says Catherine Popper, a vice president with WFD,
a work-family research and consulting firm in Boston. ``But those
incidents by far tend to be the exception, not the rule.''
 &HT;    When such a problem does arise, experts say, the cause can
usually be traced to how a flexible schedule was implemented, not
to the policy itself. Most typically, a well-meaning manager may
approve a working parent's request for flextime without thinking
through the consequences.
 &HT;    What would help: Companies need to train managers about how to
implement flexible schedules, work-family experts suggest. Before a
request for flextime is approved, the supervisor and employee
should discuss how the work will be accomplished and establish ways
for the employee to pass along needed information when she's not in
the office.
 &HT;    ``Managers need to treat flexibility as a business issue, a
strategy to achieve business results,'' Popper says, ``not as an
accommodation.''
 &HT;    + Childless workers do not get a fair share of the benefits pie.
 &HT;    ``An on-site child-care center or a lactation room are icons of
all the money that companies spend on employees with kids,'' says
Ann Price of The Childfree Network. ``For childless workers,
they're a constant reminder of all the benefits dollars that aren't
spent on us.''
 &HT;    Price is not alone in her views: Some 42 percent of the work-
family specialists in The Conference Board survey agreed that
employees without children feel they are subsidizing benefits for
other employees' families lives.
 &HT;    To some extent, the negative feelings simply reflect bad PR on
the part of employers. Companies don't usually talk up benefits
that are used primarily by workers without children, such as
tuition assistance and wellness programs, even though they are far
more common offerings.
 &HT;    What would help: As a first step, work-life consultants urge
companies to conduct focus groups and surveys to determine which
benefits childless employees value most.
 &HT;    ``Simply by asking, you communicate respect, which can head off
a lot of resentment,'' says Boston University's Mary Young.
 &HT;    A small but growing number of companies are designing
cafeteria-style benefits packages that can be used in different
ways by different employees, depending on their particular needs.
 &HT;    Xerox's 5-year-old LifeCycle Assistance Program is a striking
example: Employees are entitled to $10,000 over the course of their
career with the company, to be used for one of three purposes: to
help pay for child care, a down payment on a first home or
unreimbursed health-care expenses for members of one's household.
 &HT;    + Working parents feel they have a superior claim on the need to
balance work and outside interests.
 &HT;    At its most fundamental level, the tension between working
parents and childless employees boils down to a competition for
scarce resources. In this case, the resource is flexibility, which
the majority of employees want and most companies are loath to
grant across the board.
 &HT;    Do working parents have a greater claim on flexibility than
other staffers? The question is hotly debated among employees,
within the human-resources field and the larger community as well.
 &HT;    Certainly, once a company approves flextime for some employees,
it's difficult for anyone to know where to draw the line and on
what grounds. Is your sick child more important than my sick cat?
Is your need to leave on time to pick up your toddler from child
care more compelling than my need to get to a night-school class so
I can earn an MBA? Is your child's softball game more important
than my softball game?
 &HT;    What would help: Fortunately, if a flextime program is managed
correctly, employers don't really have to get into the messy
business of determining the moral merits of each request.
 &HT;    Amoco makes flextime and a compressed workweek available to all
employees, regardless of family status. Indeed, roughly 10,000
Amoco workers, or about a third of the work force, have opted for
the compressed workweek since the program was introduced
company-wide a year ago _ and the number of enrollees with and
without children is proportionate to their numbers in the work
force.
 &HT;    Certainly, the technology now exists to make such flexibility
possible, from voice mail and faxes to computers, beepers and
e-mail.
 &HT;    As Fran Rodgers, founder and CEO of WFD, observes, ``We're in
the midst of a revolution in the way work gets done.''
 &HT;    But the revolution hasn't been won yet. And until it is,
companies, working parents and childless employees must work
together to create the kind of workplace community in which
everyone is considerate of one another's needs, regardless of
family status.

   Behind the esthetic questions are legal ones. In recent years,
dozens of artists and their estates have sued, charging copyright
infringement, to protect works from being reproduced on coffee
cups, beach towels and the like, and from being appropriated by
other artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't protect the integrity of the work, it loses its
value,'' said Theodore Feder, president of the Artists Rights
Society, a for-profit organization that represents artists' estates
and authorizes reproductions of works by Calder, Picasso, Matisse,
Pollock, Warhol and others. ``Anybody could imitate and sell it on
the marketplace. If you couldn't distinguish one from another, it
would be worth what the cheapest one is worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other artists, though, Calder not only created singular
works but also was the best-known innovator of the mobile as an art
form. Lawyers, art experts and artists disagree over what elements
of mobile art are so identified with Calder that they cannot be
used without violating copyright law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calder basically created a medium,'' said Regina Stewart,
executive director of the New York Artists Equity Association, a
nonprofit advocacy organization for visual artists. But, referring
to the estate, she added, ``It's also like they're saying, `Don't
use acrylic paint because I'm the first artist to use it.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the mobiles, however, Amy Schwartzman, executive
director of Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts in New York, said there
might be a copyright issue if the courts found the works to be
``substantially similar'' to Calder's and the artist had seen
Calder's work, even if the artist had not consciously copied it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can absolutely draw on something as inspiration, but you
cannot copy the image,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Rower, Calder's grandson, who helped organize the
Calder retrospective, said he did not know about the specific
request made to the San Francisco museum. But he said the family
had been concerned for years about the sale of Calder-esque
mobiles. ``I find them upsetting,'' he said. ``My grandfather, when
he made the work, he never wanted it reproduced.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Graham Sears, an artist who lives in Buffalo and whose work has
been sold at the San Francisco museum, said he experimented with
new shapes and forms. In one mobile, for instance, curved blue and
red disks float around a free-form black arch. ``My work is one of
a kind,'' he said. ``Every little turn of the file and snip of the
snippet _ it's all a considered motion.''
</P>
<P>
   Howe's mobiles and sculptures are featured in a 200-page book
about his work, ``Serious Exuberance,'' with an introduction by
Peter Frank, an art critic in Los Angeles, to be released in
December by Noriega Editores. Next month, 20 of his pieces will be
displayed in a show at the Jernigan Wicker Fine Arts gallery in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's certainly not an arts-and-crafts guy; he is a
well-established artist,'' said Cheryle Wicker, the gallery owner.
``His work is very modernist and extremely original.''
</P>
<P>
   At the gift shop of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New
York, however, customers have asked if mobiles by other artists
were Calder reproductions, said Patricia Burger, a sales associate.
The shop carries mobiles by Joel Hotchkiss _ swirls of brightly
colored metal bits, fabric forms and curled wire hung from the
ceiling _ each signed by the artist. They range in price from $145
to $425.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's confusing because, for some people, their first
impression of a mobile is Calder, and they never think of other
artists,'' said Ms. Burger, who said she was told by a supervisor
last year to avoid the word Calderesque when describing the
mobiles.
</P>
<P>
   More pressing than esthetic debate for some of the artists,
however, is a loss of income. Sue Lapin, an agent who represents
Howe and Sears, said she supplied about 10 mobiles a month, worth a
total of about $2,000, to the San Francisco museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hurt our business,'' said Sandra Hotchkiss, the wife and
business partner of Hotchkiss, who lives in West Stockbridge, Mass.
``I'm not giving anyone dollar numbers, but it's made an impact.
The more museums fall into this, the more it hurts small companies
like us making our own artwork.''

VIOLENCE AND INSANITY IN MAXIMUM SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When news programs go in for recycling, they are usually moved
less by journalistic imperatives than by economic calculations,
particularly during the slow summer season.
</P>
<P>
   Cobbling together five hours of programs under the title, for
the latest example, ``Nightline in Primetime: Crime and
Punishment,'' is a lot cheaper than producing five new Ted Koppel
reports and may attract fans with short memories.
</P>
<P>
   But don't be put off. It turns out that these repackaged goods
from four years of ``Nightline'' coverage of America's prison
system bear a second look.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the five-part series, beginning with Thursday night's
visit to Central Prison in Raleigh, N.C., is given to the
maximum-security prisons that have become fashionable in response
to demands for tougher treatment of violent criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Koppel talks to victims, their relatives, prosecutors, prison
officials and some of the most recalcitrant inmates, who wind up
spending 23 hours a day in solitary confinement. The editing is a
little patchy, but the interviews bring out enough resignation,
desperation and madness to leave you wondering about the whole
system.
</P>
<P>
   Connoisseurs of television confrontations should find particular
pleasure in the encounters between the skeptical Koppel and the
murderers who have evidently put their spare time, of which they
have plenty, to perfecting their protestations, rationalizations
and posturings.
</P>
<P>
   Koppel, equipped with a hand-held camera, even ventures alone
into a cell with a lifer who is deemed particularly dangerous. This
fellow explains, ``I live by a code,'' which requires that from
time to time he assault fellow prisoners whom he deems ``the scum
of the earth.''
</P>
<P>
   The sanest of these convicts are career con men. When Koppel
asks an inmate who is given to calling himself Elvis Presley
whether one has to ``play a fool to survive here,'' the man chides
him: ``Sarcasm is one of our lesser attributes, you know. You
should discontinue its use in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Old-timers in the prison lament the sloppy standards among the
younger set, mostly drug users, who are being warehoused with them.
The veterans complain that the addicts have run down the
neighborhood to a point where these days you can't even expose your
wallet and hope to see it again. (Not like life outside, right?)
</P>
<P>
   Koppel finds few enthusiasts for the maximum-security prisons
despite their popularity with the public and with politicians.
Relatives of victims prefer the death penalty. Psychologists doubt
that 23 hours a day in solitary confinement encourages mental
stability, not to mention any hope of rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Guards are not happy about the availability of weight-lifting
equipment, which keeps the prisoners better muscled than their
warders. On the other hand, prison officials note that taking away
rewards like weights reduces their ability to control tough
characters who have very little to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Even Koppel seems shaken into hyperbole by the general air of
violence and craziness. Having interviewed prisoners who are likely
to be in their dotage before they are released, if ever, he warns
that ``most of these men will be back on the streets one day; most
of these men will be our neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what neighborhood Koppel lives in, but it would be
a miracle of rehabilitation if any graduate of Central Prison
manages to afford it.  &QL;

frequently about culture and commerce.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in 1978, when Donald and Mira Rubell had just started
buying art, they considered their first major purchase _ a painting
by Francesco Clemente _ an act of sheer courage. Clemente's
self-portrait was huge, 7 by 13 feet, and, in the delicate jargon
of the art world, ``difficult'' because of its grotesque depiction
of the artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't understand it, but we fell in love anyway,'' recalls
Rubell, a Manhattan gynecologist whose brother was Steve Rubell,
the hotelier and co-owner of Studio 54 who died in 1989. ``We were
happy to be able to own something that wasn't easy, that was
astonishing. We thought we were really pushing the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rubells had no idea how hard loving contemporary art
could become as the millennium approached. It wasn't a matter of
the money; they are the heirs to Steve Rubell's estate and several
years ago began their own hotel development business.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they and the few other collectors intrepid enough to
buy major artworks during the 1990s have had to surmount new
obstacles of size and scale.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s have been the decade of the installation. Loosely
defined as multimedia works that often take up a huge amount of
space, installations (by artists like Jenny Holzer, Matthew Barney,
Robert Gober and Bruce Nauman) have for several years dominated
events like the Venice Biennale and the Whitney Biennial. Ann
Hamilton, another installation artist, will represent the United
States in the Venice Biennale in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But the current generation of practitioners has upped the ante
with new technologies like video, laser projection and interactive
audio. More important, they have come at the right time: there are
numerous venues for large-scale contemporary art, including the
Museum of Modern Art, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los
Angeles, the Guggenheim in Bilbao, the Museum of Modern Art in San
Francisco, among major museums.
</P>
<P>
   With more installation art on display, it was only a matter of
time before wealthy collectors would covet the work, no matter how
unwieldy. ``If you love contemporary art and you want to own it,
you have to love the artist's ideas, wherever they take him,'' says
Michael Govan, director of the Dia Foundation, the Manhattan
institution that has been a locus for installation art since the
early 90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``As installation art has become firmly rooted in the mainstream
of artistic thought, individuals are comfortable enough to think
about living with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, though, is that unlike the neo-Expressionist
paintings of the 80s, which were snapped up by a relatively large
group of new collectors eager to use their Wall Street profits to
decorate downtown lofts and suburban mini-mansions, much of today's
art is, by definition, too overwhelming for most people to live
with.
</P>
<P>
   It's not surprising then that the number of important collectors
of contemporary art has dwindled to a handful. Or that cities like
Miami and San Francisco have caught up with New York as centers of
collecting. With some works now as big as the average tract home
and as heavy as a tractor trailer _ but significantly less mobile _
the question looms: who has the courage, not to mention the space,
to become a modern-day Medici?
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put it this way,'' says Robert Storr, a curator of
painting and sculpture at the Modern. ``These collectors don't live
in tidy town houses with just enough room at the bottom of the
stairwell for a tiny Corot.''
</P>
<P>
   The gallery owner Paula Cooper, who represents Gober and has
championed installation art for decades, can count the number of
serious collectors in a single breath. ``It's a short list,'' she
says. ``When you're talking about art on this scale, you need a
particular kind of dedication. It's a very efficient way to weed
out dilettantes.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the early part of the decade the Rubells made do with
filling their town house on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and a
large home in Florida with their acquisitions. They stored the
overload in a warehouse. But as painting waned, the average size of
the pieces they were buying quadrupled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The final straw,'' recalls Donald Rubell, came in 1992 with
the purchase of ``Oh! Charley, Charley, Charley ...'' by the Los
Angeles artist Charles Ray. The installation-size sculpture, which
features eight life-size casts of the artist, is 15 feet in
diameter. (It is on loan to the Whitney Museum of American Art for
the museum's Ray retrospective.)
</P>
<P>
   Their solution was extreme. In 1993, they bought a
40,000-square-foot Miami building that had been a federal
drug-confiscation facility, and in 1996 they turned it into a
collection space open to the public on the weekends and by
appointment. Among works now housed there _ it is big enough to
hold only 15 percent of the Rubells' collection _ are a Leonardo
Drew piece that is a 10-by-12-foot wall of cotton bales; a Kady
Nolan installation made from 20,000 cans of Budweiser, and Gary
Simmons's ``Duck, Duck, Noose,'' in which a hangman's noose is
surrounded by a semicircle of chairs with Ku Klux Klan hoods on
them. Carl Andre's ``43 Copper Cardinal,'' made of copper plates,
takes up an entire room.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the Cuban artist Jose Bedia's ``Nausfragios,''
which includes, among other elements, an enormous altar made out of
the hull of a boat that carried Cubans to Miami in the early 1980s.
``It's extremely powerful,'' Mrs. Rubell says. ``It's extremely
large,'' says her husband.
</P>
<P>
   While the Rubells appear to have gone to extraordinary lengths
to build their collection, the underlying motivations of
contemporary collectors are actually surprisingly simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want their place in history,'' says Thea Westreich, an
art consultant who specializes in helping wealthy clients create
major collections. ``Most of them have no idea at the beginning
what they should collect; they just know they want it to be
original and important.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Ms. Westreich's clients, Nora Stone, a San Franciscan who
with her husband, Norman is one of the few collectors who rival the
Rubells in buying large-scale works, says: ``If you have a yearning
to collect, then you need to pick a period. Sure, we'd love to
collect Rothko and Picasso, and it would be much more manageable,
but frankly, we couldn't afford to do the amount of buying we love
to do. We could afford maybe three or four major pieces, and what
fun is that?''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the size of many contemporary installations, the prices
are comparatively low, usually between $15,000 and $100,000, well
within budget of many newly minted millionaires. Even a minor
Rothko on paper, not to mention a Picasso or a Miro, generally tops
$250,000.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the urge to shock that often characterizes
those who decide to collect installations. The Stones, for
instance, are in their 50s, which is, in fact, the average age of
those who buy contemporary art these days. But they share a
teen-age enthusiasm for buying the work of young artists who court
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Their 1930s five-story home on a tony hill is literally
chockablock with art, almost all of it, Mrs. Stone concedes,
``either about sex or excrement _ it takes a lot of explaining when
people come to visit.''
</P>
<P>
   There are the Gober urinals on the second-story landing and the
sprawling Matthew Barney video ``Repressia,'' which is accompanied
by a yellow wrestling mat and climbing equipment installed in the
ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Rhoades re-created his rural California childhood in
``Jason Rhoades and Jackie Rhoades _ 13 Booth Cologne County Fair''
in the maid's room, complete with 4-H memorabilia, a state-fair
booth and handmade sausages. (``He came here and cooked them
himself on our barbecue,'' says Mrs. Stone. ``But he didn't do
anything to preserve them so we had to have a microbiologist come
in to assure us we weren't breeding anything lethal.'')
</P>
<P>
   The Stones share their master bedroom with a Sarah Lucas piece
titled ``The Night Before Last I Got Loaded. On a Bottle of
Whiskey. You Know I Feel Alright.'' It is an upside-down bicycle
adorned with photographs of the artist's nude ex-boyfriend holding
up individual food products, like an Oreo, to hide his genitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do enjoy pushing people's buttons, it's true,'' says Mrs.
Stone. Like the time her brother, who had converted to Mormonism,
came to stay. ``We had to put him in a guest room with two Mike
Kelleys. One has penises made of excrement. The other has a
likeness of Christ with Mike's head grafted on. Imagine what he
must've thought.''
</P>
<P>
   For some collectors, buying art that is on the edge _ regardless
of how unwieldy it may be _ is simply a thrill. ``It's like driving
a car at 70 miles an hour,'' says Rubell. ``At first, that's
exciting; it's enough. But soon you have to go even faster to get
that sort of esthetic charge.''
</P>
<P>
   For some collectors, however, the urge to illuminate obliterates
all other concerns. Because the art is so large and so stridently
antidecorative, it ``can gobble up everything,'' says Ydessa
Hendeles, a Toronto collector who occupies a rarefied place in her
small peer group because she is also widely considered a brilliant
curator. ``It possesses your mind and your body.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hendeles, who has been buying art at a breathtaking pace
since the late 1980s when she inherited sprawling business
interests from her father, a Holocaust survivor who became one of
Toronto's most prolific real estate developers, now owns more than
1,000 works. Her collection includes pieces by Bruce Nauman, Jenny
Holzer and Barbara Kruger, as well as an important private archive
of 19th-century fine photography.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Rubells, she long ago reconciled herself to the fact
that her passion could not fit within the walls of her own home; in
1987, after running a small commercial gallery for eight years, she
bought a 12,000-square-foot space in downtown Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Acting as her own curator, Ms. Hendeles has created a private
museum. Most years she mounts at least two significant exhibitions,
carefully creating thematic juxtapositions between
installation-scale work and old photographs. Unlike public museums
that often borrow work to complete a show, Ms. Hendeles shows only
art she owns, sometimes even buying pieces specifically to flesh
out aspects of a particular show.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't make decisions on what I want to buy based on the
medium at all,'' she says. ``I'm driven by ideas. If the work
happens to be an installation, as it is a lot these days, then I
accommodate it. There is a spectacle aspect of that that is
definitely a concern, but it's also an appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Installation art, she says, has a ``curious relationship to the
marketplace.'' Like most collectors of such art, she has only a
general idea of the current value of the pieces she has bought. She
has no intention of reselling the works, she says, and the genre is
still too new for there to have been enough benchmark resales
anyway. ``Still,'' she says, ``I'm not unaware of what good value
is. I know whether an artist whom I spot early on is considered to
be reaching a critical mass.''
</P>
<P>
   Such art also has a curious relationship to those who find a way
to own it. ``There is always a push and pull that's very sexual
with collecting,'' Ms. Hendeles says. ``Who has the power: the
artist or the collector? How far will you go for love? How far will
you go to capture an idea?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hendeles goes pretty far: she is willing to move sometimes
enormous pieces around to suit the themes of her shows. Such
physical limitations are among the hidden costs of investing in
installation art.
</P>
<P>
   Video, most collectors agree, provides additional challenges.
The installations need proper lighting and discrete rooms to
contain the audio that often accompanies the piece. The
technological demands can be daunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stresses the duct work of most museums, not to mention
people's homes,'' says Ms. Hendeles. ``You have to rip out the
walls and totally redo them.'' To accommodate their many Matthew
Barney video installations, the Stones have built walls and
completely reconfigured rooms.
</P>
<P>
   For the artists, the knowledge that collectors are moved enough
by the work to reconfigure their lives around it can be a powerful
force. ``When your work is very large and site specific, it's
mandatory that you're included in the equation,'' says Rhoades,
recalling how Brancusi incorporated his own presence and the
environment of his studio into his sculptures. ``It changes you.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all artists want to have that connection, however. Gober
knows ``almost none'' of his collectors. If he knew too well how
much trouble it caused them to accommodate his pieces, especially
the larger installations, he fears he might not make them, he says.
In fact, his most recent installation, which he spent two years
creating for the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, remains
in storage, unsold. ``It crosses my mind that these large works are
not very practical,'' he says wistfully. ``But you go where your
ideas take you. You hope some other people want to go there too.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, some other people will go almost anywhere. Pam
Kramlich and her husband, Richard, a venture capitalist who
financed high-flying start-ups like Silicon Graphics and 3Com, seem
to thrive on the physical challenges of installation art. They own
nearly 150 video-art pieces. More than a dozen major installation
are on display in their Tudor-style estate in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The mantel above the stone fireplace, which once held a David
Hockney, is now an altar for Matthew Barney's ``Cremaster'' series.
(Cremaster is a muscle in the testes.) An oak staircase frames
``Tiananmen Square'' by Dara Birnbaum, in which four miniature
liquid-crystal monitors flash fractured images of the student
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   The Kramlichs' vast lower-level party room is dominated by a
Bill Viola installation, ``The Greeting,'' essentially a huge,
moving Renaissance painting; in their bedroom, Reinhard Mucha's
installation ``Auto Reverse,'' which includes two scooters,
projects the video footage of a little boy onto the ceiling above
their king-size bed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the impressive space of their home, the Kramlichs are
outgrowing it. But they don't intend to move. ``We like the way the
art looks in an old house,'' says Mrs. Kramlich. Instead they are
building a weekend home in Napa Valley customized to accommodate
the ``really big stuff'' they can't fit in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collectors of our era are not really different than those of
other eras,'' insists her husband. ``Video installations, for
example, are just a combination of painting, sculpture and the
moving image. Sure, this kind of collecting takes a unique sort of
insanity.''

A DIGEST OF NEWS FROM THE COMPUTER WORLD

<TEXT>
<P>
   Barbara Probert, a professor of psychology at the University of
Florida who has been studying cases of math and science anxiety for
more than a decade, has turned her attention to computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get this impression that everyone is on the Web, that
everyone is technologically proficient,'' Probert said. ``While
it's not common to find `computerphobia,' anxiety is far more
common than portrayed.'' Along with Edward Delgado-Romero, her
colleague at the university's counseling center, she offers the
following simple steps for those who find themselves overwhelmed by
anxiety when faced with a keyboard:
</P>
<P>
   _ Examine your beliefs about yourself. ``If they are saying to
themselves, `I can never do this,' they are simply reinforcing
their anxiety,'' Probert said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't be afraid to make mistakes. ``A lot of people view
mistakes they make on computers worse than mistakes they make doing
something else,'' Delgado-Romero said. ``Even the most
knowledgeable computer people crash their systems every couple of
days.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Limit your exposure. ``First-time users feel they have to know
everything,'' Delgado-Romero said. ``We want them to start with
something simple. Identify what you want to do, a single task, and
complete it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask for help. ``For bright people, it's hard to ask for
help,'' Probert said. ``A lot of our students don't like feeling
helpless. Nobody does.'' But the professors offer the following
caveat:
</P>
<P>
   _ Work on self-assertion. ``People who work in this field tend
to be technically proficient, but they have poor social skills,''
Probert said. ``You need good social skills to overcome this.''
</P>
<P>
   Probert and Delgado-Romero will soon have new subjects for
observation. The University of Florida recently enacted a
requirement that all incoming students have computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guess is that there will more anxiety among the faculty
than the students,'' Delgado-Romero said.

   If the Tune Is Beethoven, Surely That's My Pager
</P>
<P>
   You know how to whistle, don't you? You just put your lips
together and reprogram your pager.
</P>
<P>
   Philips Consumer Communications recently unveiled the Myna, a
new pager that alerts owners with a nine-note melody of their
choosing. The Myna's Melody Maker function allows users to create
and store melodies by using a programming code for tempo, note
value and pitch. Or a user can choose Melody ID, which sounds an
alert notifying you about incoming calls by using melodies
generated by the caller's numeric message.
</P>
<P>
   The Myna also comes with prearranged melodies for programing,
with more melodies to be posted at Philips' Web site,
www.philipsconsumer.com.
</P>
<P>
   The prearranged melodies you can choose now include the themes
from Beethoven's Fifth, ``La Marseillaise, ``Somewhere Over the
Rainbow'' and the theme from the television show ``Green Acres.''
The last is annoying if you leave your pager on at the opera.

   Financial Support for Sites With a Unique Point of View
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere on the World Wide Web, among the gritty personal home
pages and the glitzy sites offered by corporate giants, are pages
that forge new ground _ and the Web Development Fund wants to know
about them.
</P>
<P>
   The fund, a nonprofit group, has just opened its second call for
entries for projects that will tap into the ``public interest and
creative use of the medium,'' said the fund's founder and director,
Marc Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   Crystallizing the potential of the Web to organize people, and
getting users to think about challenging issues, are two criteria
for sites that the fund seeks to support.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals will be accepted until Sept. 13. A look at the
guidelines, as well as a list of sites financed in the last year,
are available at www.weblab.org.

   IRS Zine Tells Teen-Agers About the Art of Paying Taxes
</P>
<P>
   Paying taxes is cool. That's the message that the Internal
Revenue Service is trying to sell to young people with ``Taxi,''
which the IRS describes as ``an online zine for understanding
taxes'' developed with the American Bar Association. The logo for
Taxi (www.irs.gov/taxi) is a Checker cab, last widely used in taxi
fleets before today's teen-agers were born.
</P>
<P>
   To explain how gross pay shrinks into take-home pay, the site
features Music Girl, who makes $8 an hour selling CDs, and Pizza
Dude, who earns $281.25 a week, mostly in tips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before you get too excited'' about that first job, the site
advises, ``it's important to realize that not all the money you
earn will make it to your pocket. What? Yep, taxes _ federal, state
and local _ are going to take a bite out of your paycheck.'' But,
hey, the IRS tells teen-agers, paying taxes is only fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at it this way,'' the zine says. ``To earn your paycheck
at the music store, you rely on the government for roads to get to
work, police to protect your hard-earned cash and laws to insure
that you are treated fairly. You even rely on the government to
protect the copyright of the musicians whose CDs you sell;
otherwise, there would be no music store or music industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The site may also unintentionally make impressionable teen-agers
vulnerable to the sellers of seminars who claim that the paying of
taxes is voluntary because the zine refers several times to
``voluntary compliance'' without making it clear that the term
applies only to the filling out of tax returns, not to the
requirement that taxes be paid.

   Japanese Senior Managers Are Lagging in Internet Access
</P>
<P>
   Remember a couple of years ago when Americans believed that
Japanese business could do no wrong? Neither does anybody else,
apparently. The newly formed legions of Japan-bashers can look for
more ammunition in a recent study on Internet usage. According to a
survey by Andersen Consulting, only 71 percent of Japanese
executives have access to the Internet, the lowest level among
senior management in nine of the world's leading economies.
</P>
<P>
   American executives led the field, with 99 percent having access
to the Internet, followed by executives from Canada (98 percent),
France (91 percent) and Britain (91 percent). Only 13 percent of
Japanese executives were reported as ``comfortable'' or
``familiar'' with the Internet, compared with 46 percent of
American executives, although the Japanese were much more likely to
use e-mail (69 percent) than their counterparts in Germany (55
percent).

   Pat Boone and Y2K

   The Year 2000 problem has a new spokesman, Pat Boone. The singer

Educational Task Force, known as Y2KNET.

   ``I want to help bring Y2K to the family dinner table,'' Boone
said in a statement. He added that there was no reason to panic.
Boone, who recently tampered with his wholesome image by recording
a heavy-metal album, seems to have found a kindred spirit in
Y2KNET. The educational group is in fact sponsored by a precious
metals and rare coins dealer, Swiss America Trading Corp., which
suggests hedging against the Year 2000 bug by investing in _ what
else? _ precious metals and rare coins.

 VANCOUVER, British Columbia: eyelash anymore.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vancouver has had a Chinese presence since the 1850s, decades
before the city's incorporation. It's just that the Chinese profile
has risen so sharply, so fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chinese food and Chinese people were always around,'' said
Murray McMillen, the food editor of The Vancouver Sun, ``but I
didn't feel the culinary influence when I was growing up.'' The
culinary impact of the large Chinese population in the city has
become so pervasive people here treat Chinese ingredients the way
people in Houston treat salsa.
</P>
<P>
   Raazhan Rae, a schoolteacher, used to shop in Chinatown, but now
she can find what she needs in her own neighborhood, where most of
the residents are westerners. ``The vegetable department where I
shop probably has one-third Oriental vegetables,'' she said, ``and
it has fish tanks.''
</P>
<P>
   For Kasey Wilson, the author of several guidebooks and the
co-host of a radio food show, has noticed the difference among her
circle of friends. ``Westerners buy a lot of prepared dim sum,
steam them in little Chinese steamer baskets they have at home and
serve them as appetizers. The fact that you can just pick up a
Peking duck and serve it with lingonberry sauce, that barbecued
duck is used to top pizzas, that chefs are buying them for their
restaurants and cutting them in strips for appetizers ... .''
</P>
<P>
   Those in the know, Chinese or not, who are looking for the best
and cheapest fish, shop in Chinatown. Sylvia Molnar, a cooking
teacher, goes there at least once a week to buy live fish,
especially sturgeon and carp.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Vancouver are most likely to encounter its Chinese
specialties in the restaurants. Sun Sui Wah is renowned for its
squab and its live fish. The restaurant's weekend dim sum are just
as sophisticated as its dinner fare. For Westerners who want to dip
no more than a toe into shark's fin dishes, shark's fin dumplings
are the route. The glutinous sharks' fin makes a pleasing contrast
to the shrimp and ham in the filling, all encased in a very tender
dough. The savvy diner saves room for fresh-from-the-oven egg tarts
and the best sponge cake on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   The Shanghai Bistro in downtown Vancouver also puts on an
impressive dim sum banquet at lunch every day, and a standout is
the silky handmade noodles with spicy eggplant, all cooked to sweet
perfection. This is also the place for steamed buns filled with
pork and cilantro, perfectly cooked so that the buns do not taste,
as they often do, like uncooked dough. Shanghai scallion pancakes
are toasty brown on the outside and soft inside.
</P>
<P>
   The best winter melon soup I had in Vancouver was at the Grand
King Seafood Restaurant, improbably in a Holiday Inn. (Don't let
the locations of Chinese restaurants put you off.)
</P>
<P>
   In Richmond, the President Chinese Seafood Restaurant, in the
Radisson Hotel (which also houses a Buddhist temple), does a superb
suckling pig and a refined shark's fin soup with a rich, clear
broth. The deep-fried Alaskan king crab announced its arrival by
sending waves of fragrant garlic to the table, and what the Chinese
call hollow vegetable but others call water spinach, is superb with
ginger, garlic, hot pepper and preserved bean curd.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to try the ovaries of the snow frog, guaranteed to
make you beautiful, improve your complexion and clean your system,
says Melina Hung, communications director of the Radisson, have
them in the pudding. You'll never know they are there.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, some of the very best of these restaurants see few
westerners. ``I've had a hard time convincing Caucasians to come to
these restaurants,'' said Stephen Wong, the cookbook author. ``They
won't spend money on pea shoots,'' a reference to one of the
cuisine's most popular vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, these top restaurateurs have not gone out of
their way to welcome Westerners. But now that some of those wealthy
Hong Kong Chinese are returning home, the restaurants may find they
have to step up their outreach programs.

CLIMATE IS RIGHT FOR `GIVE 'EM HELL' ATTACK ON CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Aug. 9)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If Harry Truman returned to Earth to commemorate
the 50th anniversary of his astonishing campaign against Thomas E.
Dewey, he would find the climate conducive to a reprise of his
``give 'em hell'' assault on a ``do-nothing'' Congress.
</P>
<P>
   When lawmakers headed home over the last two weeks for their
August vacation, they created the proper atmosphere for a
Truman-style tirade by rejecting or leaving unattended a number of
important issues.
</P>
<P>
   In Truman's day, the issues were a post-war housing shortage,
inflation, federal aid to education and civil rights. Today the
need is to save Social Security, curb the use of tobacco by young
people, reform campaign financing, protect patients in managed
health care plans and improve educational standards while
safeguarding public schools.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most divisive matters before the Republican
leadership is whether to use an expected budget surplus to cut
taxes or save Social Security or both.
</P>
<P>
   Like the 80th Congress that Truman attacked with such vigor and
success in 1948, the 105th has bowed to the dictates of big
contributors and has failed to fulfill a number of its promises. It
has also placed the financial well-being of the Republican Party
ahead of the need to devise a more honest system of raising and
spending campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   Such a situation would have provided fertile ground for the
plain-spoken Truman, who was heading, according to Democrats and
Republicans alike, toward certain defeat at the hands of New York
Gov. Dewey, the GOP nominee, in November 1948.
</P>
<P>
   At the Democratic convention in Philadelphia that July no
speaker who appeared before Truman did talked of winning as though
he or she meant it, according to Truman biographer David
McCullough.
</P>
<P>
   But Truman meant it. He was a fighter who refused to accept
defeat as his destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Striding into the convention hall at 2 o'clock on a hot, humid
morning, he ended the lethargy that until then had held delegates
captive.
</P>
<P>
   He did it first by predicting that he and his running mate,
Kentucky Sen. Alben W. Barkley, ``will win this election and make
these Republicans like it _ don't you forget that.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he truly roused the crowd's partisan passions by announcing
that he was summoning the 80th Congress back into session on July
26 _ ``which out in Missouri, we call Turnip Day'' _ to see if the
members would pass laws to implement their platform promises.
</P>
<P>
   Furious at Truman, whom they denounced with every conceivable
epithet, the Republicans did convene on Turnip Day and, as the
president had anticipated, did nothing to fulfill the party's
promises.
</P>
<P>
   Truman then launched his nationwide whistle-stop campaign,
lambasting the 80th Congress, and won the election.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton has been critical of the 105th Congress' poor
performance but does not have Truman's political option of calling
the lawmakers back into session. Congressional leaders already have
agreed to return next month.
</P>
<P>
   It is doubtful, however, that much will be accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   But the record of Congress, while dismal, has not been a total
disaster. Working closely with Clinton, legislators already have
accomplished a goal close to Truman's heart. They have balanced the
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also voted to reform and modernize the Internal
Revenue Service and approved a massive and much-needed highway
construction bill.
</P>
<P>
   They also have provided support for Clinton on important foreign
policy matters just as the 80th Congress did for Truman in
approving the Marshall Plan and other vital Cold War policies.
</P>
<P>
   How Truman would react personally to Clinton is anyone's guess.
He probably would find the current president charming and
intelligent, and as a lifelong Democrat he probably would support
him without condoning his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Since his own administration was besmirched by scandal, Truman
might possibly sympathize with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He would not, however, approve of any extra-marital adventures.
In Truman's life, there were only four women of importance _ his
mother, his sister Mary Jane, his daughter Margaret and his wife
Bess, whom he courted for many years before she agreed to marry
him.
</P>
<P>
   In Berlin for his 1945 Potsdam conference with Soviet dictator
Josef Stalin and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Truman
met a young Army public relations officer who told the president he
could get him anything he wanted, including women.
</P>
<P>
   Truman bristled. ``Listen, son, I married my sweetheart,'' he
said. ``She doesn't run around on me, and I don't run around on
her. I want that understood. Don't ever mention that kind of stuff
to me again.''
</P>
<P>
   Old-fashioned morality meant a lot to Truman, as did
old-fashioned politics and old-fashioned decency.
</P>
<P>
   At the commissioning of the $4.5 billion nuclear-powered
aircraft carrier USS Harry Truman on July 25, Clinton noted that 50
years ago that week Truman integrated the armed services for the
first time and that since then ``our men and women in uniform have
truly been a force for freedom and a shining example to all
humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his good deeds and accomplishments, Truman also was a
tart-tongued, free-swinging politician. If he were around today, he
undoubtedly would have some pithy comments about characters and
events.
</P>
<P>
   He certainly would be able to pierce the fog of hypocrisy and
pomposity that too often envelops Capitol Hill and the White House.

cart about 10 minutes after the doctor signed his papers. He had
been dead for two days _ one less than he lived _ but it took his
mother a while to make it to the district hospital so far from her
home.
</P>
<P>
   The whole transaction lasted about two minutes. Dr. Bart Vander
Plaetse took a piece of paper with the words ``Notice of the Death
of a Person'' printed on top. He wrote down the dead boy's name and
for his age he scribbled in a fraction: 1/52. Since he had no idea
of the cause of death, the doctor listed ARI _ acute respiratory
infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we say when we can't say something else,'' Vander
Plaetse explained with a sad shrug. ``It'll let his mother bury
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The next sounds floating through the doctor's window were the
thud of a cow bell and the whack of a whip as two donkeys hauled
the body to the burial ground across the road. Macdonald's mother
and grandmother sat in the cart with the cardboard box that held
their boy. Several women walked behind softly singing funeral
songs.
</P>
<P>
   There were no men at the service: Mcdonald's father died a few
months ago. His grandfather died last year. A brother died the year
before. And three uncles are also gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``You almost can't keep track of it all,'' said Vander Plaetse,
a gentle, 32 year-old internist from Belgium, who is one of two
doctors serving this rural area of 140,000 people not far from the
border of Botswana. ``There are just so many sick people,'' he
said. ``We want to control it all and we try. But it's getting
harder. There are times when it seems like it's getting out from
under us.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe has suddenly turned into the deadly center of the AIDS
epidemic. Recent studies now suggest that it may have the highest
infection rate on earth.
</P>
<P>
   The optimism of the West is a cruel fantasy in Zimbabwe. There
is no treatment, no cure, little hope and _ in almost every country
in Africa _ far more pressing problems to face each day.
</P>
<P>
   The savage virus has left few people untouched: it has
devastated families, communities and cities. But seen through the
weary and often bloodshot eyes of the beleaguered doctors and
nurses who must attend to the sick people around them, AIDS is just
another word for dying _ and it's just another disease.
</P>
<P>
   People here call it ``iyoyo'' _ ``that thing.'' And in the spare
but spotless clinics of Zimbabwe _ where aspirin is available only
a third of the time _ ``that thing'' may not even be the one that
matters most. With an average of less than $10 to spend on each
person's health every year, most African nations have no money for
tests, for fancy drugs or for complicated support networks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the magnitude of the epidemic, the great majority of
people in Africa have no idea if they are infected with HIV, the
virus that causes AIDS, and most don't want to know.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe, formerly Rhodesia, once had a health system that was
the envy of southern Africa. Yet, fueled by AIDS and also by
increasing poverty and instability, illness has begun to overcome
the country. Tuberculosis, hepatitis, malaria, measles and cholera
_ all wholly preventable _ have surged mercilessly. So have infant
mortality, stillbirths and sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, during the last heavy rains, this region in the center
of Zimbabwe reported 82,000 cases of malaria _ which means that
more than half the local population got sick. The hospital here was
so overwhelmed by people desperate for help that nurses couldn't
even make their way down the teeming halls.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, 100 people died of malaria in Zimbabwe. Last year the
figure was 2,800. Reported cases of tuberculosis _ the sentinel
illness of poverty and social decline _ have risen from 5,000 a
year in 1986 to 35,000 last year. This year it is worse.
</P>
<P>
   THE HARD NUMBERS
</P>
<P>
   If the effects of it all are sometimes impossible to believe,
they are also impossible to ignore: Average life expectancy in
Zimbabwe _ often considered the most reliable barometer of a
nation's health _ was 61 in 1993. By the end of the century,
however, it will fall to 49.
</P>
<P>
   In 10 years, if trends continue, United Nations officials say,
it will probably be closer to 40 _ which would push development
here _ and in many other sub-Saharan countries _ back nearly a
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``AIDS is the basic fact of all our lives,'' said Vander
Plaetse, whose work day runs from dawn to dusk and includes dealing
with everything from setting bones to major surgery. ``But it is
not the only fact. And to be honest, it is not a fact we can do
that much about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may sound callous,'' said Vander Plaetse, who seems
incapable of any such emotion, ``but there may be better ways to
spend our time and money than treating a complicated disease we
will never have the money or the drugs or the ability to cure.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an understandable comment from a man who couldn't send his
nurses out in the community in July to give vaccines because the
Health Ministry had no money left to buy gas in the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, that's OK,'' he said softly. ``Last year we had no radio
contact with any other clinic for two months because we couldn't
pay a $300 phone bill. It's hard to focus on the big picture when
that's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   It would probably be hard in any case, because numbers like this
are almost too great to have meaning: 4 million people were newly
infected with the AIDS virus in the countries of sub-Saharan Africa
last year alone.
</P>
<P>
   The epidemic has already killed 10 million people in sub-Saharan
Africa _ 90 percent of the world's AIDS deaths _ and because there
is so little hope of access to the best drugs, at least 20 million
more will almost certainly die.
</P>
<P>
   In Zimbabwe, doctors and nurses all know the bad news and they
all worry about it. They face AIDS _ in one way or another all day,
every day: when they see a man with genital herpes, when they draw
blood or stick themselves with a needle, when they deliver a baby,
when any patient starts to cough, or wheeze or breaks out in a
rash.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And particularly when people die _ of fevers and wasting and
pneumonia or TB.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago 500 people died each week in Zimbabwe; last year
the figure was 650. Now it's close to 750. They either die after a
``short illness,'' or they die after a ``long illness.'' The
newspapers don't print ages in obituaries. They don't have to. The
words ``loving son,'' and ``remarkable daughter,'' _ repeated in
nearly every other notice _ tell the story clearly enough.
</P>
<P>
   Tsholotsho is a two-hour drive from Bulawayo, the nearest big
city. Most patients walk _ sometimes for days across dried river
beds and dusty roads _ to get here. The squat brick hospital is a
wide open building at the end of the only paved road in the region.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, Vander Plaetse will sweep from one room to the next
_ setting bones, operating on an elderly woman with internal
bleeding, checking the health of pregnant women, seeing dozens of
patients with skin rashes, eye diseases, malaria and tuberculosis.
He has a chart for everyone and his nurses are disciplined and
extremely well trained.
</P>
<P>
   A women in a bright red dress, wrapped in a yellow polyester
blanket, appears. She is wearing tennis shoes and says she is
losing weight, bleeding and having dizzy spells.
</P>
<P>
   He examines her but it's hard to guess her problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does your neck hurt you?'' he asked, after examining her
swollen glands. She shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell her we will give her tablets,'' Vander Plaetse says to a
nurse who helps him negotiate the roughest spots of the Shona
language. ``We will give her pills to help her retain water. And we
will give her some vitamins.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not much, but there is not much else he has to offer. The
woman might have malaria or pneumonia or diarrhea or TB or
dysentery. Or all of them, or AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   She looks at the pills she is handed as if they were pythons.
Then she walks out. The next patient is coughing too hard to talk.
Vander Plaetse decided to let him sit in the hall for a few
moments, until he feels better. He never came back.
</P>
<P>
   THE HARRIED CLINICS
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to worry about something that is going to kill you
one day when so many other problems are going to kill you
tomorrow,'' said Dr. Ruth Labode, the frank and energetic medical
director for the region that includes Tsholotsho and Bulawayo, the
industrial city of 900,000 that is the country's second largest
city. ``Have you ever sat down with a man who is trying to feed his
hungry children and had a talk about safe sex? It's not easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Labode has a poster on a wall outside her office that lists
the ``standard case definition'' of bubonic plague. It is not a
historical artifact. She talks about leprosy, malaria, diarrhea,
TB.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have too many hungry people,'' she concludes. ``And of
course AIDS makes it all worse.''
</P>
<P>
   At this year's international AIDS conference in Geneva there was
particularly grim news about Zimbabwe and neighboring Botswana. At
least in part because statistics here are better than in many other
developing countries, experts say that as many as 25 percent of all
adults may now be infected with HIV. In some places _ including
tourist crossroads like Victoria Falls _ the rate is closer to 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a staggering figure anywhere, but particularly in a
country that can afford to spend only $11 per person each year on
health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to think about AIDS,'' said Sithozile Nkala, a
nurse at the district hospital in Tsholotsho. ``It's not because I
am afraid or because I think we can run away from it. But the only
way I can do my job is to see every patient and try to just help
them. If I say to somebody you have AIDS _ and we almost never know
because we don't have money for tests _ they just go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I don't think you can write about the effect of
AIDS on the health care system,'' she said. ``Most people just stay
home to die. And we encourage that because really there is very
little we can do here for them except to try and make them
comfortable. And people at home can do that better than we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Nkala is 28 and she came from a small village more than 200
miles from Tsholotsho. She said that most people don't want to know
if they are infected with HIV, and it is common lore among nurses
that those who do find out often give up and die much more quickly
than if they had lived on in ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   When Miss Nkala is not tending to patients she is folding
uniforms, or towels or wrapping sterile instruments in paper. She
is unusual because she has been at the hospital for three years and
has no plans to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Burnout has been high here _ in part because treating people who
can't be cured is never easy. And in part because since Zimbabwe
trains nurses and doctors well but can afford to pay them only a
pittance, they can make more money in South Africa when they are
done with school, and many of them do.
</P>
<P>
   Like most regional health care centers, the hospital here is
down 50 percent of its nurses, and recruiting is hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the biggest problem we have,'' Vander Plaetse said.
``Because nurses do nearly everything here. Without them there is
no health care.''
</P>
<P>
   THE UNLIKELY OPTIMIST
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bornapate Nkomo hates it when people start talking about
``hopeless'' Africa. ``It's a code,'' he said. ``It means let's
forget them. They can't be helped. Let's move on to something
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Nkomo is in charge of treating sexually transmitted diseases in
Bulawayo. He is a careful man who spent seven years in
Czechoslovakia (when that country still existed). One year was
devoted to language study and the next six were for medical school.
</P>
<P>
   The Khami Road Clinic is the only sexually transmitted disease
center in Bulawayo and Nkomo runs it. Its pale green waiting rooms
overflow with people waiting quietly for help.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one doctor and few major drugs, but the clinic is
clean, efficient and well lit.
</P>
<P>
   Nkomo can see 130 people a day _ although most days he sees far
fewer. Sexually transmitted diseases have long been taken as the
best marker for the prevalence of HIV; in addition to being a sign
of risky sexual behavior, the diseases themselves often make it far
easier to become infected. Last year 70 percent of the patients
tested in one clinic in Harare were infected with HIV. No similar
study has been conducted here _ but Nkomo assumes the figures can't
be much different.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to assume that almost everybody who walks in the door
is going to get AIDS,'' he said. ``But you can't dwell on it.
Because if you do then you just walk out and go home for good.''
</P>
<P>
   He has no intention of doing that. A thin man with a wispy
string of beard, he manages to be both an optimist and a realist.
</P>
<P>
   This day he will see a variety of people: a boy with a broken
ankle and a woman with a skin rash and a man who has a strange
swelling in his feet. One woman comes in with elevated blood
pressure _ but Nkomo will be able to do little for her because
there are no drugs available at the moment for her condition.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe has a list of drugs that doctors consider essential for
treating the most common and commonly cured illnesses _ and most
basic medicines are usually available. But it takes aggressive
pharmacists, luck and good connections to keep a well-stocked
clinic. Today there is no aspirin, no acyclovir (for treatment of
herpes, one of the most common sexually transmitted infections),
and penicillin won't be in until this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want more drugs and I want donors to help buy them for us,''
Nkomo said. He has recently returned from three months' work at a
clinic in Liverpool and it pains him greatly to see how easily most
of his clients could be treated for many of their illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why shouldn't we want to treat AIDS?'' he asks. ``What kind of
doctor would I be if I sat here quietly and watched everyone in
England taking drugs that will save their lives and knowing that we
are all going to die?''
</P>
<P>
   A 23-year-old man comes into the office. He is shy, embarrassed
and silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to tell me what's bothering you if I'm going to treat
it,'' Nkomo said, quietly. ``That's what I am here for.''
</P>
<P>
   The patient has reason to believe he has a sexually transmitted
disease and upon examination it is clear that he is right.
</P>
<P>
   ``When did you last meet someone?'' the doctor asked, using a
common euphemism here for having sex. The answer was last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you use a condom?'' he asked. The answer was a quiet no.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is she your regular partner?'' he continued. No again. ``When
did you meet someone before her?'' The week before. The same
questions followed with the same answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know about AIDS?'' he asks. Yes, the patient replies,
dazed but slightly angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you care?'' Nkomo asks, his voice rising sharply. ``Do
you want to die?'' Of course not, the patient replied. Sometimes I
just forget.
</P>
<P>
   Nkomo gives the man a lecture and tells him condoms are always
free at his clinic. He shows him how to use the condoms _ there is
a wooden pole on his desk for demonstrations. And he warns the
young man that sex these days is not a game.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the patient is gone Nkomo takes both hands and slams
them on the desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes this is so painful,'' he whispered. ``What can I do
for these people? I want to be out there fighting or them. Most of
the time I believe we will turn the tide. But sometimes I ask
myself if we are all just going to disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   THE AILING NURSE
</P>
<P>
   Mildred passes for what is considered middle class in this part
of Africa. She is a highly trained nurse who earns about $100 a
month but recently she became too sick to work. She has fevers and
headaches and no appetite.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, who has spent his life working on the railroads,
seems healthy, and neither has taken an AIDS test.
</P>
<P>
   For the last month she and her husband have been on a drug hunt
_ desperately trying to find a way to acquire enough antiretroviral
medicine to keep her alive. The couple have three children and live
in a lovely brick house in a suburb of Bulawayo that once was
dominated by the whites who ruled Rhodesia.
</P>
<P>
   They invited a reporter into their home with great reluctance
and with the hope that publicity _ however vague and indirect _
might somehow help them. When asked how she became infected, she
replied at first that she wasn't. When pressed she conceded she
must be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't explain it,'' she said, fighting back the tears. ``I
can't explain it at all. I never had any extra love. I have always
worked hard. I don't deserve to die and I know I don't have to.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many drugs in Zimbabwe to treat the secondary
infections caused by AIDS _ the pneumonias and fungal infections
and other ailments that come when a person's immune system is too
weak to do its job. But the latest therapies to treat the virus
itself are not available and there are very few people who could
afford them if they were. So this couple recently went to South
Africa to see if they could buy a stay of execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got to a clinic and the doctor told us it would be about
$1,000 a month for the drugs,'' the husband said, moaning softly.
``That was some sort of discount price. I make $200 a month. We
could afford the drugs for maybe one month or two. And that is
nothing. It would only make us poor. So we are waiting now for God
to help us. We are hoping God will help us all.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; It isn't the sort of record that makes you want
to leap around the living room.
</P>
<P>
   Gillian Welch's follow-up to her Grammy-nominated debut opens
with a song about murder and continues with further ruminations on
the dark side of human nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't set out to make a dark, aggressive album,'' says
Welch, who sings as if she was raised shoeless in the Appalachian
mountains but is actually the daughter of a Hollywood TV composer.
``That's just the type of material that was getting written.''
</P>
<P>
   Welch was introduced to the likes of the Carter Family and Woody
Guthrie at an early age when she attended a ``hippie grade school''
where kids sang old folk songs. At the age of 8, she began playing
guitar, but it wasn't until she landed at the University of
California, Santa Cruz, that her passion for bluegrass was born.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the title of her current T-Bone Burnett-produced album,
``Hell Among the Yearlings'' (Almo Sounds), was borrowed from an
ancient fiddle tune. And some of the new songs were written on
banjo, a new instrument for Welch, who collaborates with her
partner, multi-instrumentalist David Rawlings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those banjo tunes have been really fun to play live,'' said
Welch, who appears Friday at McCabe's in Santa Monica. ``People
seem to really dig the banjo.''
</P>
<P>
   Welch, who lives in Nashville, recently recorded a duet with one
of her idols, bluegrass great Ralph Stanley of the Stanley
Brothers. The song appears on Stanley's ``Clinch Mountain Country''
(Rebel Records), a two-disc collection of duets with Bob Dylan,
George Jones, Alison Krauss and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the scariest things I've ever done,'' Welch
said. ``We sang a Carter Family song, and I did the best I could.
It was a true honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Welch also landed the tune ``Leaving Train'' on the soundtrack
to ``The Horse Whisperer.''
</P>
<P>
   Although her debut, ``Revival,'' was nominated for a Grammy in
the best contemporary folk album category, Welch has mixed feelings
about being dubbed a folk artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't feel like a folk singer,'' she admits.
</P>
<P>
   The new record, with its spare and downbeat mood on songs like
``My Morphine,'' ``Winter's Come &AMP; Gone'' and ``Devil Had a Hold of
Me'' is not without levity. The tune ``Honey Now,'' for example,
resembles primitive Sun-era rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   But the tone is set by the compelling album-opener ``Caleb
Meyer,'' about a woman who slits the throat of her attacker with a
broken bottle.
</P>
<P>
   ``That song was a precursor of things to come,'' Welch said.
``It was the first song I ever wrote on banjo, and things just sort
of unfolded from there.''

 &HT;    Earth mother Harris' pure voice transcends time
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are quite possibly two of the purest sounds on the planet:
the clear notes of an acoustic guitar and Emmylou Harris' voice.
This new album from Nashville's earth mother is built on both,
proving that, decades after her hippie days with Gram Parsons, the
granola-flavored, country-rock formula still works. Like Nanci
Griffith, Harris' voice is the solid centerpiece, whether she's
wailing an a capella, piney-woods hymn (``Calling My Children
Home'') or growling like Wynonna (``Ain't Living Long'').
</P>
<P>
   The tunes here aren't particularly distinctive; you could easily
throw on a Harris album from the 1970s and not tell the difference.
In fact, two of the highlights are songs excavated from those
beaded-and-braided days: ``Love Hurts'' and ``Boulder to
Birmingham.'' Recorded before a live audience, the sound is warm
and intimate, with little clutter from the crowd and harmonies much
richer than most studio albums.
</P>
<P>
   Harris may not have changed her sound much in 20 years, and
we've watched her hair turn gray and her contemporaries (Linda
Ronstadt) fade into reminders of the vinyl era. But, unlike many
other acoustic artists who came out of the pot-and-pedal-steel
scene of the early '70s, Harris has managed to avoid becoming a
cliche, mainly because her voice is so timeless.
</P>

   Emmylou Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Eminent. 14 tracks.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   The verdict: Country-rock queen ages, but doesn't abdicate.

   Brian Setzer Orchestra.

<P>
   Interscope Records. 13 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   The second album by Brian Setzer's big-band ensemble may be the
one to restore the former Stray Cat to his early-1980s glory. A
brassed-up version of the Cats' neo-rockabilly hit ``Rock This
Town'' is already nudging up to the Cherry Poppin' Daddies on
alternative radio play-
</P>
<P>
   lists, and a duet with No Doubt singer Gwen Stefani on the Elvis
Presley tune ``You're the Boss'' should follow. Covering the bases,
Setzer throws in everything from old-time country gospel (``This
Old House'') to swoony balladeering (``Since I Don't Have You'').
Sure, it seems like a desperate attempt by a pop has-been to cash
in on the current swing craze, but Setzer has the chops to pull it
off. ``The Dirty Boogie'' is the real, swingin' thing, Daddy-o.

</P>
<P>
   Say you're doing a disc called ``Ultimate Broadway.'' Why in the
world would you include cuts from British star Elaine Paige and the
great (but out of place) Aretha Franklin? Why not mix it up a bit
by choosing terrific, if not well-known, numbers from classic
shows? ``Shall I Tell You What I Think of You?'' from ``The King
and I,'' for instance, or ``At the Ballet'' from ``A Chorus Line,''
or ``My White Knight'' from ``The Music Man.'' Instead, we get a
mess of retreads already indelibly imprinted on our brains. The
good news here? It's named Ethel Merman, Judy Holliday, Jerry
Orbach and ``Rent.''

</P>
<P>
   This past season, this esteemed young ensemble celebrated the
centennial of Brahms' death by performing his complete chamber
works at Emory University. The musicians' intimate understanding of
the repertoire shines through winningly here, as does a
cohesiveness and synchronism usually found only in chamber groups
twice this one's age (it was formed in 1993). Pianist and artistic
director Will Ransom is featured on all three works, including
Brahms' only horn trio and a peas-in-a-pod reading of Hungarian
Dances Nos. 5 and 6 for four hands, the other two of which belong
to Ransom's wife, Keiko. It's an impressive outing.

   After this, the self-appointed queen of hip-hop/soul can add
speed singing to her title. Mary J. Blige rips through the first
three singles _ even worse, big singles (``Real Love,'' ``You
Remind Me,'' ``Reminisce'') _ in a blurry 4:46, and she doesn't
really slow down until 15 tracks later, on ``Everything.'' Um,
isn't this the setting where artists usually take their time,
improvise on occasion and flesh out the songs in a way we could
only experience live? Well, that doesn't happen until you're way
into this recording, headed toward her new covers of ``Day
Dreaming'' and ``Misty Blue.'' The musical trip is not a chore, but
you could consider it an exercise.

<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Hip and quirky, this soundtrack to the Farrelly brothers'
screwball comedy provides fresh evidence that pop music has left
alternative rock in the dust as the Next Big Thing. Combining new
faces in jangly pop-rock (Ben Lee, Ivy and Zuba) and old-school
hitmakers (Joe Jackson, the Foundations), ``Mary'' is a catchy set
of lighthearted party tunes that leaves you humming. Among the
highlights are three new tracks from legendary boomer-rocker
Jonathan Richman, who formed the Modern Lovers in the 1970s as a
tribute to Lou Reed and the Velvet Underground. On the title track,
the tongue-in-cheek ballad ``True Love Is Not Nice'' and his
reworked masterpiece ``Let Her Go Into the Darkness,'' Richman
demonstrates that his wit and song craft remain intact after all
these years.

 &HT;    Gill shines with `hard-core country'
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After releasing several albums that he now considers
``fragmented stylistically,'' Vince Gill says he wanted ``The Key''
to be about ``hard-core traditional country.'' He succeeds
admirably, but the reality is that Gill is such a superlative
singer and the overall quality of the songs is so high that he
could have done them in saloon, pure pop or rockabilly style and
the album would sell.
</P>
<P>
   Gill, himself an in-demand studio picker and vocalist, is backed
by a country-comfort cast. It includes session stars Randy Scruggs
on guitar and Hargus ``Pig'' Robbins on piano, with a roster of
vocalists that features, among others, Dawn Sears, Shelby Lynne,
Lee Ann Womack, Alison Krauss and Patty Loveless. Loveless
charmingly holds her own with Gill dueting on ``My Kind of Woman/My
Kind of Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of the 13 songs were written by Gill, which means, as
usual, that some can be taken as biographical, although he says,
``A song has its own life, its own meaning for each listener.''
Sure, Vince. Tell that to fans who are aware of your recent divorce
while they're listening to such emotion-invoking tunes as ``All
Those Years,'' ``There's Not Much Love Here Anymore'' or ``I Never
Really Knew You.''
</P>
<P>
   The only downer is the necessity of ``The Key to Life,'' a
tribute to his late banjo-playing father, but it's what Gill,
speaking from his Nashville home, calls an upbeat ``near talkin'
blues'' tune compared to the musically dark ``Go Rest High on That
Mountain,'' Gill's wrenching response to the death of his brother
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Key''
</P>
<P>
   Vince Gill.
</P>
<P>
   MCA. 13 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Golf nut Gill aces pure country.

 &HT;    Mini views: Reviews of the latest on video
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   -- ``Jackie Brown'' (R) _ Ninety minutes of plot stretched to
154. Quentin Tarantino's attenuated version of an Elmore Leonard
novel stars Pam Grier as a flight attendant caught between an arms
dealer (Samuel L. Jackson) and an FBI agent (Michael Keaton). She's
aided in a triple-cross by stolid Robert Forster as a bail
bondsman. Using a straightforward style this time, Tarantino seems
to be showing that he doesn't have to wow us with tricks or fancy
cuts. But by the time he recycles a time-tweaking gimmick from his
past two films, it's a relief to see some of his old showmanship.
The flick has a few inspired moments, and the soundtrack is the
expected great mix of 1970s tunes. But there's a difference between
homage and hackwork.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Deceiver'' (R) _ A would-be murder thriller composed
entirely of twists, and zero content. The twin Pate Brothers wrote
and directed this woefully artificial film about a rich epileptic
(Tim Roth) being questioned about the murder of a prostitute (Renee
Zellwegger). Michael Rooker and Chris Penn are the cops, and while
the collective acting is fine, the mental cat-and-mouse games
become less believable the more ``clever'' they become. Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Meet the Deedles'' (PG) _ The epitome of a celluloid baby
sitter, this is a slapped-together comedy that seems to be making
up its plot as it goes along. The truth is, that's not such a bad
thing. The teen comedy has a carefree wit and appealing young
stars. Paul Walker and Steve Van Wormer play rich Hawaiian twins
who are mistaken for park rangers in Yellowstone. (Don't ask.)
There, they battle evil Dennis Hopper, who lives underground and
marshals his vicious army of ... prairie dogs. Brainless, yes, but
not as offensive as that other Disney comedy, ``Krippendorf's
Tribe.'' Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Black Cauldron'' (PG) _ There's a reason this animated
Disney feature is only now coming out on tape: It's no good. Sort
of Tolkien-lite, it centers on a young man who must discover the
titular, power-invested pot and keep it from the hands of the evil
Horned King. He's aided by a fuzzy ``cute'' creature and a blond
princess, but the movie is never funny enough or scary enough. And
some of the climactic animation would be laughed off a
Saturday-morning TV screen. Priced to buy: $26.99. Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Proposition'' (R) _ A guilty, trashy pleasure. Sort of.
William Hurt and Madeline Stowe play a wealthy 1930s couple who
recruit poor Doogie Howser _ oops, make that Neil Patrick Harris _
to be the sperm donor for their baby. (Hurt is sterile.) Donating
in the time-honored way, poor Doogie (dang, sorry) falls in love
with Stowe. Suspicious deaths and family secrets follow. A wallow
in old-fashioned melodrama that includes Kenneth Branagh as a
``Thorn Birds''-style priest and Blythe Danner as a Mrs.
Danvers-type domestic, the movie makes only one big mistake: It
actually takes itself seriously. If you don't, you'll have some
fun. Grade: B-

 &HT;    Best new video release
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Wedding Singer'' (PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   Adam Sandler as you've never seen him before: likable.
</P>
<P>
   In this sweet flick, he plays Robbie Hart, a wedding singer
unceremoniously stood up at the altar by his own fiancee ... which
results in a few memorable, drunken receptions at which he howls
``Love Stinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for him, a caterer named Julia (Drew Barrymore) is there
to lend him a friendly shoulder. Too bad she's planning to get
married herself. But this is, of course, a romantic comedy, so you
know what's bound to happen. Getting there, however, is a treat,
thanks to the two endearing stars and to the movie's dead-on
celebration (and satire) of all things 1980s, from Robbie's shaggy
coif to his best pal's one-glove fashion statement.
</P>
<P>
   And any movie that works in a cameo by Billy Idol (as himself)
has its heart (or smirk) in the right place. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Also starring Sandler: ``Airheads,'' ``Billy Madison,'' ``Happy
Gilmore.''

 &HT;    Speeding?: Georgia cop has heard all the excuses
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Lee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have you heard the one about the guy caught for speeding who
said he was hurrying home to catch an ``Andy Griffith'' marathon?
</P>
<P>
   Dominick Andrews has _ and hundreds of other excuses, enough to
fill a book. The Macon, Georgia police officer has turned his
experiences patrolling I-75 into ``What's Your Excuse?''
(Riverside, $9.95), a self-published collection of anecdotes from
his side of the radar gear.
</P>
<P>
   There was the driver who told him, ``The IRS waits for no one.''
The woman who claimed to have distemper. The woman so upset at
getting ticketed she threw up on his shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Writing more than 400 tickets a month provides plenty of
material.
</P>
<P>
   When 35-year-old Andrews pulls over a car, he walks to the
driver's door with the don't-mess-with-me stride of a former Marine
and competitive bodybuilder. Face expressionless. Waiting for the
inevitable: ``I wasn't speeding, it was the car in front of me, I
just got on the ramp and there's no way I could accelerate that
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes sir, yes ma'am, tell it to the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews has heard it all before, and it doesn't punch his ticket
_ except when drivers ask to be let off with a warning. ``This
isn't negotiable,'' he says. ``The speed limit sign is your
warning.''
</P>
<P>
   He's ticketed plenty of metro Atlanta drivers on their way to
the coast _ enough to make him think of the fun he could have if he
were working there. Maybe he could top his personal best of 580
tickets in a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was up in Atlanta just recently and I said to myself, `I
wish they would let me run amuck. I would have a ball up there.'''

HALLMARK TO ELIMINATE 200 GRAPHIC-ARTS JOBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES R.T. CRUMPLEY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ More than 200 of the current 600 jobs in
Hallmark Cards Inc.'s graphic arts division will be eliminated over
the next three years, employees were told Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will accommodate that (reduction) over time through
retraining, redeployment and attrition,'' said Steve Doyal, a
Hallmark spokesman. ``It is (management's) intent to have no
layoffs but, long term, fewer jobs in that division.''
</P>
<P>
   The graphic arts division is at Hallmark's headquarters in the
Crown Center complex. The employees heard the news Tuesday morning
at the Heartland Theatre in the Crown Center Shops.
</P>
<P>
   Graphic arts is a manufacturing-oriented division that
essentially translates art from the easel into ready-to-print form.
Most products that Hallmark manufactures get routed through the
graphics arts division, including greetings cards, wrapping paper
and packaging.
</P>
<P>
   Doyal said new digital technology could replace some workers in
graphic arts. From now until the end of 2001, more than 200
positions will be taken out of the division.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives people lots of time to digest it, think about it, act
upon it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hallmark employed 5,894 in the Kansas City headquarters at the
end of 1997. That was about the same as the 5,892 and the 5,825
employed at the end of 1996 and 1995, Doyal said. Employment
balloons in the summer with interns and other seasonal workers;
Hallmark now employs 6,264 at its headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Hallmark employs about 1,000 workers each in plants
in Liberty, Mo., and Lawrence and Topeka in Kansas. Also, it
employs 776 in a plant in Leavenworth, Kan.

 &HT;    Atlanta gets its own book festival
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, Atlanta readers have bemoaned the fact that the city
doesn't have a literary festival similar to Nashville's Southern
Festival of Books and the Miami Book Fair.
</P>
<P>
   But it does.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's not on the scale of those events, but since 1991 the
Atlanta Jewish Community Center's Book Festival has put together a
stellar lineup of literary lions, including Leon Uris, Norman
Mailer, Joseph Heller, Pat Conroy and Faye Kellerman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only show in town,'' says special events coordinator
Esther Solin, who scored a major coup this year by persuading John
Updike to be a keynote speaker. Updike, whose ``Bech at Bay'' will
be published this fall, will open the festival Nov. 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called the Jewish Book Festival, but it's really for the
community of Atlanta,'' Solin says. ``Either the writer or the
topic must be Jewish. This year, our lead speaker, John Updike, is
a Christian, but his book is about a Jewish author who wins the
Pulitzer Prize. And we always have a strong Holocaust segment.''
</P>
<P>
   Solin expects more than 4,000 people to attend the eight-day
festival. Advance ticket purchases are urged for Updike and some of
the other big names. ``We had to close the doors when Pat Conroy
spoke because the building could only hold 900 people.''
</P>
<P>
   Other authors scheduled include Thomas Cahill (``The Gifts of
the Jews''), Brian Weiss (``Many Lives, Many Masters''), Dan
Kurzman (``Soldier of Peace: The Life of Yitzhak Rabin''), Sylvia
Wygoda (daughter of Hermann Wygoda, co-author of ``In the Shadow of
the Swastika'') and Nelly Toll (``When Memory Speaks: The Holocaust
in Art''). All events are at the Atlanta Jewish Community Center,
1745 Peachtree St. N.E. Information: 404-875-7881. After Sept. 1,
call 770-662-9100.
</P>
<P>
   AND THE WINNER IS ... In a vote that was about as surprising as
``Titanic'' sweeping the Oscars, the Southern Book Critics Circle
selected Charles Frazier's ``Cold Mountain'' as the best work of
fiction published about the South in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   The nonfiction winner was Edward Ball's ``Slaves in the
Family.'' Ball, a Savannah native, explored his family's
slave-holding past and detailed his search for the descendants of
the people his ancestors kept as slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier's novel, which also won the National Book Award, is the
odyssey of a Confederate soldier who makes his way across North
Carolina toward his home in the mountains and the sweetheart he
left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Finalists in the fiction category included ``Dreamer,'' a novel
about Martin Luther King Jr. by Charles Johnson, and ``News of the
Spirit,'' a collection of short stories by Lee Smith. In

   LITERARY DEALS: War is hell, but it's also profitable. Damon
Gause Jr. of Jefferson recently sold his father's first-person
account of a dramatic escape from a Japanese prison camp to
Hyperion for six figures. Now Doubleday has paid $500,000 for the
rights to Hampton Sides' ``We're All Ghosts Here,'' a story of a
1945 raid to free Americans in a POW camp in the Philippines. Sides
is a writer for Outside and Sports Illustrated. ... Imagine
``Jaws'' a few thousand years older and a lot bigger. That was the
premise of Steven Alten's thriller ``Meg,'' about a Jurassic shark.
Doubleday signed Alten to a two-book deal for $2.2 million, but
decided to pass on his second book, ``Fathom.'' Meanwhile,
Kensington Books has shelled out a low six figures for ``The
Trench,'' Alten's sequel to ``Meg.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: Whole kit and caboodle very entertaining
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 9: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As I recall, it was Marcel Proust, the French novelist, who kept
a basket of kittens by his worktable to amuse him and lend charm to
the solitary hours he struggled to write.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't improved my literary output, but I have a back yard
full of kits and cats. Somebody warned me that the four volunteer
adult cats who ate at my house would reproduce and I should rush
them off to the vet for operations. The vet didn't think so, and it
turned out the babies are newcomers, courtesy of a
dishwater-colored old mama cat who strolled in from a trip down the
road.
</P>
<P>
   I saw her first as she walked up the driveway with a baby kitten
in her mouth. I was afraid to approach her, afraid she would drop
the baby in the road and somebody would run over him. But I did set
out a bowl of milk for them. It was misguided hospitality. I don't
know what she did with that baby, but she brought others and so did
a pal of hers, another unprepossessing old tabby with ball-bearing
jaws.
</P>
<P>
   Now I have, at last count, six adult cats and eight (I think)
young'uns. And Proust hasn't a thing on me for being entertained by
them. I have an orchestra seat on the back porch for the morning
show those cats and kittens put on. I take my coffee and tiptoe
out. (They sometimes run and hide at the sight of me.)
</P>
<P>
   The babies are the comics. When their mamas walk across the
terrace, they follow, tails high, lifting their feet in precise,
graceful imitation. There's one I am totally captivated by. I would
like to keep him, but he runs under the house when I step in the
yard, and I have a guilty feeling I shouldn't value the prettiest
one above the others. It's like men who always fall for the
prettiest girl, or girls who ignore the worthy, homely fellow in
favor of the good-looking one.
</P>
<P>
   But this baby cat is a beauty. He has a fluffy, cream-colored
coat with black ears, a black nose, black paws and a black tail. He
looks hand-painted, but he doesn't give himself airs. He rolls and
tussles with the rest of them, he swats his mother and tumbles
about in mock distress when she swats him back. He climbs up in the
dogwood tree and falls out. He walks along the path between the
screened porch and the rock-walled flower bed, pausing to poke a
paw between the rocks in search of something.
</P>
<P>
   I have about given up on flower boxes in front of the kitchen
windows because the kittens have taken them over. They like to
sleep on petunias and pretend to eat the ferns. I have seen them
digging in the soft window box dirt, using it for their bathroom,
and then fastidiously covering it up. So much for geraniums.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the morning show includes a race. One cat, usually a
grown-up, sits quietly examining the woods and the sky like a
general making a tactical decision. And then he takes off running.
The others, cats and kittens, take out after him. He may stop
suddenly, disconcerting his followers, or he may leap on the trunk
of the pear tree and surge up its rough flank like a soldier taking
a beachhead.
</P>
<P>
   I was amused to see the little cream-and-black fellow imitating
him. The trouble was that he reached for a branch nobody told him
was thorny and tried to get airborne from a rosebush.
</P>
<P>
   They are as curious as human children. They knocked down a yard
broom made of twigs and poked at it with their paws, staging mock
battles over it.
</P>
<P>
   I had to go, too, but I felt that after such a show, I should
send roses backstage. But of course, they would eat them.

 &HT;    Faith, food &AMP; fellowship: Salem Campground more than just a
place to meet
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COVINGTON, Ga. -- For all the 100 years of her life, Mary Sue
Hull Ramsey has spent part of August where she is today _ in a
rustic cabin at Salem Campground in Newton County.
</P>
<P>
   Her four children have all come, as have eight of her 10
grandchildren and nine of 18 great-grandchildren. They are staying
in several of 26 ``tents'' as the wooden cottages are called in a
nod to the days when families pitched tents behind wagons.
</P>
<P>
   August, as born-and-bred Methodists know, is camp meeting time.
Young and old abandon the chores of home, school, and office to
feast on food, faith and fellowship.
</P>
<P>
   They gather, as their ancestors did, on hard wooden benches in
sawdust-floored pavilions to hear revival-minded preachers extol
them to follow Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   They chat in rocking chairs on primitive porches, looking out
over children playing ball or bicycling together, oblivious to the
absence of electronic entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   And they gather along long tables to pass platters of country
fried steak, bowls of green beans and plates of sliced tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Some people drive over just for worship services _ as many as
1,000 sometimes at Salem. But for the ``tenters,'' who stay during
the week, camp meeting is a combination multigenerational summer
camp and family reunion. It takes place in more than 20 locations
around Georgia, including the 170-year-old Salem where services
continue twice daily through Friday. Families develop ties and
traditions that transcend geography.
</P>
<P>
   Patty Lassiter, 40, came to Salem from Charlotte, N.C., as a
child with a family friend. As an adult still living in Charlotte,
she's back for her tenth year with her husband and three children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an experience I wanted my children to have,'' she said.
``We're not related to anyone here, but we've been made such a part
of it it is like we're one big happy family. I feel comfortable
letting my kids run free. No matter where they are, there's an
adult overlooking them.''
</P>
<P>
   Her son Robbie Lassiter, 18, has decided to become a minister
because of his experience at Salem.
</P>
<P>
   ``He prays from his heart,'' his mother said. ``I think he'll
make a good one. I really do.''
</P>
<P>
   Camp meetings have been a part of the American landscape since
the late 18th century, imported to the colonies by Presbyterians
from Scotland and Ireland. Among the largest and most significant
was a gathering at Cane Ridge, Ky., in 1801, when 25,000 souls came
together under Barton Stone, a Presbyterian minister disillusioned
with Calvinism. Stone later established the Disciples of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Many Presbyterians grew uncomfortable with the emotionalism of
some early camp meetings, but Methodists were ready to take the
gatherings up as their own. Methodist circuit riders spread the
word about meetings through announcements and fliers, and the news
circulated by mouth. Scheduled between the planting and harvesting
seasons, camp meetings became an annual tradition for many
families, no matter their denomination.
</P>
<P>
   The men of the family and the farmworkers hitched two mules to a
two-horse wagon at the Hull farm in Mary Sue Ramsey's childhood
more than 90 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd bring our mattresses and our trunks,'' she recalled. ``We
brought a wood stove , and on the back end of the wagon was a load
of firewood. Usually, the children would come on the wagon. Mama
and Papa came in the buggy and drove a horse over.''
</P>
<P>
   The girls usually had new muslin dresses and white shoes
especially for camp meeting, she said, less formal than the silk
dresses and patent leather shoes for Sunday church at home.
</P>
<P>
   She met her husband, George Ramsey, at Salem when he and a
friend asked some girls to take a ride in his Model T Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the four girls, I was the one he made a date with _ to walk
me down to the tabernacle for services,'' she said. ``I felt kind
of honored he picked me.''
</P>
<P>
   Granddaughter Laura Ramsey Kemp, 44, came to her first camp
meeting when she was a week old. ``I was born the Friday night camp
meeting started,'' she said. ``Mother cried because she couldn't
come. The next Friday night, she brought me in a basket.'' She
hasn't missed a single year since.
</P>
<P>
   Some things about Salem have changed over the years. A few of
the cottages now have window air-conditioning units and the open
tabernacle has ceiling fans and fluorescent lights. But there are
still a few funeral home fans with scalloped handles. And, the
spirit is still the same, said the Rev. Thomas Elliott Jr, 36,
pastor of First United Methodist Church in Dacula, Ga. and the
fourth generation of Salem's Elliott clan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use the song ``Sweet, Sweet Spirit'' here,'' he said after
a morning service in the tabernacle. ``There really is a sweet
spirit in this place. The altar here is really a circle completed
in eternity. On the other side are the great cloud of witnesses who
have been here but are now in the heavenly realm.''
</P>
<P>
   To take their places are plenty of children _ 134 of them in
youth Bible studies this week.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Tidwell, 11, of Chattanooga, Tenn., Casey Bolles, 12, of
Conyers, Ga., and Rebecca Zawinsky, 11, of Houston, are friends who
keep up with each other during the year and try to find each other
as soon as they climb out of their families' cars at Salem every
year.
</P>
<P>
   Anna and Rebecca have been together here for a week each year of
their lives. Casey's parents began coming four years ago. They
attend services, ride bicycles, play softball and participate in a
range of youth activities from scavenger hunts to talent shows.
</P>
<P>
   On the last night of camp meeting, they and the other children
make wooden crosses and attach candles to them, then take a
candlelight walk through the campground.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have communion, and everybody's always crying,'' said Anna.
``Nobody ever wants to say goodbye.''

 &HT;    Speeding excuses

<P>
   Here are some of police oficer Dominick Andrews' favorite lines
from speeders:
</P>
<P>
   -- ``I'm on my way to the office to try and be the 10th caller
to win Vince Gill tickets.'' (52 mph in a 30-mph zone.)
</P>
<P>
   -- ``I had a CD player installed by Circuit City and they must
have shorted out my speedometer because every time I hit a bump, it

   -- ``I'm on my way to dispose of my father's ashes.'' (73 in a

 &HT;    A downtown that straddles two states finds unity and prosperity
in division
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 9: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   McCaysville, Ga.-Copperhill, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   here's a new line in town.
</P>
<P>
   You see it slice through the Hometown Foods IGA and its parking
lot, then continue diagonally across the street before scaling the
yellow brick building that houses the Copper Emporium furniture
store.
</P>
<P>
   The long blue line isn't just the talk of the town; it's the
talk of two states.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the Copper Basin, known now for tourism and white-water
rafting instead of its once-flourishing copper industry, the North
Georgia town of McCaysville (population 1,062) shares a downtown
with Copperhill, Tenn. (501). And they share the blue line, rich in
irony: Closely approximating the border separating the two states,
it was painted to unify the two municipalities and to draw the
attention of a new wave of visitors brought in on an excursion
train from nearby Blue Ridge, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Goss, who with his wife, Cricket, owns the IGA, calls the
line ``a point-of-interest line, not a dividing line. It reminds us
that we have common problems and concerns and that we have to work
together.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bob Myers tells it, the idea for the line surfaced a few
months ago when a ``spontaneous group'' of about a dozen area
residents got together at a coffee shop and began talking about
``the common misconception that the Toccoa River is the border''
between Georgia and Tennessee. Actually, the state line slices
across the river, which is called the Toccoa in Georgia and the
Ocoee in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Not only would a line clear up the confusion about the border,
the group believed, but it also would be ``an oddity that people
could relate to, something to have fun with,'' recalls Myers, a
computer consultant.
</P>
<P>
   So, in early June and mostly at night to avoid traffic, he and
others, including artists Rebecca Williams and Marilou Knight,
began painting the block-long line, using the same kind of paint
that marks handicap parking spaces. Their efforts were temporarily
foiled when the parking lot was resurfaced, but the group recently
began restriping the lot, tackling the job on a sultry Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Goss is a longtime line man, having painted one in the store lot
several years ago, amid the influx of visitors for Olympic events
on the Ocoee. And he's also a veteran of the two-state business
world, noting with a laugh that ``we have the privilege of paying
taxes in both states.''
</P>
<P>
   How's the line working? It's fun, doing its job of getting
attention and bringing in visitors, say business owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of visitors come in and want to know where the line
is,'' reports Kay Brown, co-owner with daughter Becky Morgan, of
the Colonial House, which sells antiques, jewelry and collectibles.
``They love to straddle the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Jack, adds that many people ``come in and say, `We
walked all the way from Tennessee to get to your place.'''
</P>
<P>
   The line was a hit one recent Saturday when the Blue Ridge
Scenic Railway train roared in and unloaded passengers for an
hourlong visit before making the 13-mile trip back to Blue Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   Several people took turns straddling the line while friends and
family recorded the event on film. And Lillian Thomason of Canton,
Ga., played with her young granddaughter, Maria Allison, holding
hands across the blue stripe. ``We're a long way apart,'' Thomason
joked.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was quite an experience, being in two states at once.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is something profoundly moving about this
seemingly simple act. In this vast country, where the sheer
magnitude of place can diminish a mere human, the ability to touch
two states at once somehow makes a person feel more in scale, more
a part of the great big space.
</P>
<P>
   The new blue line, which so keenly looks to the future, also
recalls the past.
</P>
<P>
   Just about everybody around here tells the story of how the
official state border _ the one that the blue line closely traces _
is bogus because surveyors back in the 1800s spent too much time
sampling from a moonshine still they had wandered upon.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that's the reason for the mistaken survey or just a good
story, Georgia rightly has contended that its boundary with
Tennessee should lie farther north _ at the 35th parallel, as
specified in the laws of both states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Correcting the boundary would shift a mile-wide strip of south
Chattanooga and most of Copperhill to Georgia,'' says Edwin
Jackson, co-author with Marion Hemperley of ``Georgia's Boundaries:
The Shaping of a State,'' published in 1993 by the University of
Georgia's Carl Vinson Institute of Government.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not likely to happen, says Jackson, a faculty member at
the institute. ``Although suit could be filed in the U.S. Supreme
Court, rulings of that court in similar situations suggest that a
boundary long recognized and accepted will stand, even if later
found to have been drawn in error.''
</P>
<P>
   The state line has worked in strange ways. Consider Marion
``Cap'' Hamby, a barrel-chested, big-voiced copper plant foreman
who rose to political power in the 1920s and lived in a house on
the border. His daughter-in-law, Luneta Hamby, has a newspaper
clipping from the Feb. 11, 1944, Copper City Advance, which
reports:
</P>
<P>
   ``Marion Hamby has served, at different times, as the mayor of
McCaysville and the mayor of Copperhill without moving his
residence. He was mentioned in `Ripley's Believe It or Not' several
years ago as the only man who had served as mayor in two cities, in
two different states, while living in the same house.'' (The
article notes that the law at that time allowed residents on the
line ``to choose the state of their choice.'')
</P>
<P>
   Strolling around town on a recent steamy morning, Luneta Hamby,
history lover and onetime tour guide, said that shopping and living
and dining and attending school in two states always has been part
of everyday life for area residents, and that now the blue line
brings that duality alive for tourists. ``I think it's great.''
</P>
<P>
   And a big change. The 54-year-old article notes, ``For all
practical purposes the line is disregarded and the north side of
the river is called Copperhill and south of the river is known as
McCaysville. Or more simply, the Georgia side and the Tennessee
side.''
</P>
<P>
   Comes now the blue line.
</P>
<P>
   It's already highly visible, and organizers want to make it even
more notable; plans call for extending the line for several blocks
_ over the tops of five buildings. ``It'll be fun for small
airplanes,'' says Bob Myers. ``We hope to become a landmark they
could use for points of reference. And the line could be part of a
sightseeing trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus it seems that, for this blue line, the sky's the limit.

 &HT;    Eastwood, Lee flicks make move to DVD
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Slowly but surely, the phenomenon known as DVD is invading the
American market. DVD stands for digital video disc. Essentially, it
looks like a compact disc, or CD, only it plays a movie instead of
music. Offering superior sound and picture, DVDs could eventually
replace videos as the home entertainment format of choice.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, DVD movies can be found in Atlanta at most high-tech
electronics stores and, on a limited basis, at selected Blockbuster
stores. Players cost between $500 and $1,500; most discs sell for
$24.95 to $29.95.
</P>
<P>
   Recommended in stores this week:
</P>
<P>
   ``Do the Right Thing'': Spike Lee's stunning and audacious 1989
film about racial tension in a Brooklyn neighborhood over the
course of one long hot day and one longer, hotter night looks
terrific on DVD. The soundtrack is in-your-face, just like it was
in the theater, and the picture is crisp and bright. Though this is
not a collector's edition, it includes some fascinating production
notes. For example, Lee explains in his director's introduction,
``I knew at the end I wanted the black folks to take a stand. ...
There's an understanding between Sal and Mookie at the end, but I
didn't want to strike a false note. None of this `everybody join
hands and sing ``We Are the World''' stuff. Because I don't think
that's realistic at this present time in America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Beguiled'': Clint Eastwood has often said that this is his
favorite among all his movies. It's certainly one of his _ and
director Don Siegel's _ more unusual efforts. Eastwood plays a
Yankee soldier who recuperates from his wounds in an isolated
all-girls' school in the South. Made in 1971, the movie is a kind
of Civil War Gothic. The DVD version shows off Bruce Surtees'
beautiful, almost dreamy photography wonderfully. Especially fun
(and funny, in its way) is the theatrical trailer for the film.
``Refuge or hell?'' asks the solemn narrator about this girls'
school full of ``man-deprived women, man-eager girls!'' He goes on:
``Is he helpless victim to be threatened, teased, enticed, or is he
a man, aggressively wooing ... who must love to stay alive ... ?''
</P>
<P>
   And on: ``Man ... the sexual symbol ... the enemy!''
</P>
<P>
   Women's liberation (or rather, some weird misinterpretation of
it) had apparently reached the Hollywood marketing machine by the
early 1970s. I'm not sure if that's good news.

 &HT;    COLUMN: For return of `Halloween,' let's celebrate slasher
spirit
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shane never came back. But Jamie Lee Curtis has.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years after her breakthrough role in ``Halloween,'' she's
returned to her scream-queen roots in ``Halloween H2O.''
</P>
<P>
   The original ``Halloween'' engendered a whole new genre, known
variously as slasher movies or splatter flicks. Typically, to make
the ``Halloween'' connection clear, they were given commemoratively
themed titles: ``My Bloody Valentine,'' ``Prom Night,'' etc. They
also featured a new kind of nasty: a boogeyman (or woman) who, in
the immortal words of Michael Myers' doctor (Donald Pleasence) in
``Halloween,'' ``has no reason, no conscience, no understanding ...
he just kills.''
</P>
<P>
   And he is also almost always unkillable. That's called
sequel-think.
</P>
<P>
   Herewith, the cream of the slasher crop, including two movies
that, technically, owe nothing to ``Halloween'' but should be on
the list of anyone in the mood for mindless gore:
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Halloween'' (1978):
</P>
<P>
   The story: A little-boy-psycho grows up to be a big-boy-psycho
and, after breaking out of a mental hospital, comes home to, um,
celebrate Halloween with his sister (Curtis) and her friends.
</P>
<P>
   Claim to fame: It started the whole slice-and-dice film cycle of
the late 1970s and early '80s. By 1984, ``Halloween,'' which was
made for $320,000, had grossed more than $75 million.
</P>
<P>
   Killer's profile: He wears a Halloween mask and can't seem to
kill girls who don't date much.
</P>
<P>
   Victim's profile: Sexually active teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   Quick cut from behind the camera: Director John Carpenter, a
smart ol' boy from Kentucky, knew exactly what he had done in
making ``Halloween.'' He told The New Yorker (pre-Tina Brown!) that
his movie was ``purely an exercise in style. The plot is barely
existent. ... It's a haunted-house movie.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``A Nightmare on Elm Street'' (1984):
</P>
<P>
   The story: Wes Craven's movie is a bad dream come true.
Literally. And over and over. Four teenagers all suffer from the
same nightmare in which they're chased by a demented pervert named
Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund).
</P>
<P>
   Claim to fame: Its success inspired five sequels of varying
quality (No. 2 is the worst, 4 is the best). Altogether, Freddy and
his dreamers made more money for their studio, New Line, than the
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
</P>
<P>
   Killer's profile: A rakish combo of a striped sweater borrowed
from a Dead End Kid, a slouch hat that Jimmy Durante might've worn,
and razor-blade fingernails. He has trouble killing ''good'' girls,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Victim's profile: Teenagers who live on Elm Street.
</P>
<P>
   Quick cut from behind the camera: Craven dreamed up the movie
while sitting at a restaurant in Santa Monica, Calif. He based the
premise on some articles in the Los Angeles newspaper about people
who had inexplicably died in their sleep.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' (1974):
</P>
<P>
   The story: Unlucky teenagers come across a very strange family
in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Claim to fame: Predating ``Halloween,'' Tobe Hooper's lurid,
low-budget movie became well-known on the cult and midnight
circuits because of its unabashed nastiness (say, a lamp made of
human arms).
</P>
<P>
   Killer's profile: Leatherface, the main boogeyman, wears a mask
made of human flesh and wields (rather ineptly, it must be said)
the titular chain saw.
</P>
<P>
   Victim's profile: Teenagers who take a wrong turn _ especially
females in hot pants.
</P>
<P>
   Quick cut from behind the camera: The voice of the ominous
narrator at the beginning belongs to an unbilled John Larroquette.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Dawn of the Dead'' (1979):
</P>
<P>
   The story: George Romero's flesh-eating zombies invade a
shopping mall. Sort of the ultimate Atlanta movie. (When one
character wonders why they've come to the mall, another explains,
``They don't know why ... they just remember ... remember they
wanna be here.'')
</P>
<P>
   Claim to fame: This long-awaited sequel to Romero's ``Night of
the Living Dead'' is less known but made more money. And it's a lot
funnier (zombies ride escalators while Muzak plays).
</P>
<P>
   Killer's profile: The usual Romero zombie-mix in polyester or
leather.
</P>
<P>
   Victim's profile: Anything still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Quick cut from behind the camera: Explaining the look of the
film, Romero said, ``I wanted the mall to look like a mall. ... I
wanted bright light in what is, except for the zombies, a safe,
comfortable environment.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about the ``Friday the 13th'' series?
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, these are supposed to be recommendations.

KC VOTERS APPROVE PLAN TO RESTORE LIBERTY MEMORIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE PENN and MARK MORRIS  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Kansas Citians voted Tuesday to save their
crumbling Liberty Memorial for generations to come.
</P>
<P>
   They approved a temporary half-cent sales tax increase to be
collected for 18 months, designed to generate $45 million. The
money will be used to restore the crumbling 72-year-old monument,
which was built to honor soldiers in World War I.
</P>
<P>
   There were 34,648 votes for the tax measure and 13,606 against.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $45 million, $30 million will be used for the restoration
and $15 million will be set aside as an endowment for future
repairs. The Liberty Memorial is the largest memorial in the world
honoring World War I veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Mayor Emanuel Cleaver said Kansas Citians showed
their respect for sacrifices made during World War I by approving
the sales tax with 72 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously this is a great day for Kansas City,'' Cleaver said.
``Kansas Citians have shown their commitment to keep their future
as bright as their past.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaver said several factors came together to give the tax
campaign a boost: a booming local economy, ongoing reconstruction
of Union Station and the recent release of the popular film
``Saving Private Ryan,'' which served as a powerful reminder of the
sacrifices soldiers make in war.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was destined to happen,'' Cleaver said. ``Everything was
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Funds generated by the sales tax can be used only to renovate
the memorial and to establish the endowment. Collection of the tax
will begin April 1, 1999, and end Sept. 30, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Parks Director Mark McHenry said site work on the
renovation would begin after tax collection begins, when revenue is
expected to roll in at the rate of about $2.5 million a month.
</P>
<P>
   The work, McHenry said, will be done on a ``pay-as-you-go''
basis to maximize the amount of money available for the project and
avoid paying debt service on bonds. The city hopes to have the
renovated memorial open by November 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also must establish an advisory panel to recommend to
the city parks board how the $15 million capital maintenance fund
will be spent.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial was closed in 1994 after engineers found structural
flaws and extensive deterioration within the shell of the
structure. Years of freezing and thawing cycles caused serious
damage to the courtyard and the stairways.
</P>
<P>
   The renovation will fortify the structural support system under
the courtyard, replace the elevated decks and stairways and restore
or replace the fountains, urns and sphinxes.
</P>
<P>
   The renovation will also restore Memory Hall, the museum
building, the tower and the grounds adjacent to the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   The state has authorized $5 million to help with the restoration
and maintenance of the memorial. Also, U.S. Sen. Kit Bond is
sponsoring federal legislation to provide another $5 million for
the project.
</P>
<P>
   Former Kansas City Mayor Richard L. Berkley also cited the film
``Saving Private Ryan,'' saying the movie hammered home the heroism
of the American soldier.
</P>
<P>
   ``That movie dealt with World War II, but the message was the
same,'' Berkley said. ``So many people sacrificed so much. We must
commit ourselves to never letting it happen again.''

MOVIE IS A MURDER MYSTERY, NOT A MUSIC MOMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Kurt and Courtney,'' a documentary, is unrated. Running time
is 1 hour 39 minutes. Three out of four stars.
</P>
<P>
   Did rock 'n' roll bad girl Courtney Love murder her husband,
grunge rock icon Kurt Cobain?
</P>
<P>
   The makers of the new documentary ``Kurt and Courtney'' aren't
sure, but after seeing this film you wouldn't put it past her.
</P>
<P>
   The latest from BBC documentarian Nick Broomfield (``Heidi
Fleiss: Hollywood Madam'') comes to theaters with a history of
notoriety. It was about to debut at last January's Sundance Film
Festival when organizers yanked the film. Love, who inherited
Cobain's estate, was threatening legal action, saying that ``Kurt
and Courtney'' made unauthorized use of her late husband's music.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt she was also concerned because the documentary suggests
that the Cobains' marriage was on the rocks and examines theories
that the 1994 death of Cobain, singer and songwriter of Nirvana,
may not have been a suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The version of ``Kurt and Courtney'' now being shown has been
trimmed of Cobain's music, but then this documentary isn't really
about music or musicians. It's a murder mystery, an investigation
into one man's death and a devastating character study of his
widow.
</P>
<P>
   It's all quite entertaining in a scuzzy, bottom-of-the-barrel
fashion, populated as it is with ``witnesses'' who are practically
boiling over with resentments and issues, that is, when they're not
nodding off from whatever drug they've recently ingested.
</P>
<P>
   There is, for example, an incredibly repellent musician known as
El Duce who claims Love once offered him $50,000 to ``whack'' her
husband. Intriguingly, El Duce turned up dead (run over by a train)
just weeks after Broomfield interviewed him.
</P>
<P>
   The former nanny of the Cobains' infant daughter clearly is
terrified of Love: ``If he wasn't murdered,'' she says of Cobain,
``he was driven to murdering himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Broomfield examines the murder theories of Tom Grant, a former
deputy sheriff obsessed with Cobain's death. Interviews with
Cobain's friends and family, on the other hand, suggest the young
star was a prime candidate for suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most colorful and appalling figures on display is
Love's estranged father, Hank Harrison. He believes his son-in-law
was murdered, though he doesn't know if Courtney was responsible.
Nevertheless Papa has written a scathing tell-all book about his
little girl's history of drugs, violence and sex. Not one shred of
affection is evident.
</P>
<P>
   Broomfield claims to have had no bias against Love going into
this project: ``I didn't have angle on the story. I was just trying
to find my way through it.'' But he could hardly have been neutral
by the end. He interviews journalists who have attempted to write
about the Cobains who were harassed by Love. At a party, the angry
widow physically attacked one such scribe, a British woman.
</P>
<P>
   And halfway through filming, Broomfield was told that his
funding had dried up. Pressured by Love, MTV had withdrawn its
support.
</P>
<P>
   Even as she comes off as a vile-tempered dragon lady, Love earns
a certain admiration for her chutzpah. One can only react with
stunned amusement at her metamorphosis from snarling punk to
well-coiffed Hollywood starlet.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath the fashion-plate exterior that ruthless, merciless
core is as solid as a rock. When Broomfield finally does get a shot
at Love and asks why she intimidates journalists, she smiles icily
and answers: ``Well, it's my right. It's not against the law.''

ONLY THE STAR IS OUT OF CONTROL IN `UNDER THE SKIN' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Under the Skin,'' a drama, is unrated. It contains language,
nudity, sex and violence. Running time is 1 hour 25 minutes. Three
out of four stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the Skin'' opens with an unsettling, yet weirdly
compelling image that sets the tone for the rest of the film.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's 20-year-old star, Samantha Morton (a familiar face
from Brit cable TV imports such as ``Tom Jones,'' ``Emma'' and
``Jane Eyre'') lolls on a sofa, utterly naked, and absentmindedly
draws on her skin with a marker.
</P>
<P>
   It's a shock _ and a warning. This is a film about letting it
all out, physically and emotionally. And Morton delivers a
devastating performance as a young woman spinning rapidly out of
control.
</P>
<P>
   The first moments of writer//director Carine Adler's debut are
devoted to outlining the relationships between 19-year-old Iris
(Morton), her slightly older sister Rose (Claire Rushbrook, who
played the sullen daughter in ``Secrets and Lies'') and their
mother (Rita Tushingham). Mama has a brain tumor that will soon
kill her, and her daughters react to this tragedy in very different
ways.
</P>
<P>
   The solidly middle-class Rose, who is happily married, pregnant
with her first child and holding down a career as a travel agent _
is distraught over losing her mother, with whom she speaks with
daily.
</P>
<P>
   Iris, on the other hand, is a feral gamin with a short, punky
'do, a checkered employment record and an angry restlessness.
Clearly, Mama favors the conventional Rose; inside, Iris seethes
with jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   Rose mourns Mama's death, but knows that life must go on. Iris,
though, reacts by embarking on a downward spiral. She dumps her
longtime boyfriend and begins stalking the streets for anonymous
sex, always a dangerous avocation but doubly so in the era of AIDs.
Odder still, she takes to wearing her mother's sunglasses, wig and
faux leopard-skin coat on her prowls. She looks like a weird
combination of housewife and hooker.
</P>
<P>
   We've all seen similar studies of self-destructive behavior.
What makes Adler's film worth enduring is her sense of style, which
neither condemns Iris nor attempts to explain her behavior. Bereft
of both moralizing and prurience, ``Under the Skin'' examines Iris'
actions objectively, while Adler's hand held camera lends a cinema
verite hyper-realism to the proceedings. The result is a film of
raw and lacerating immediacy.
</P>
<P>
   Do not underestimate the excellence of Morton's riveting
performance. Most actresses would make of Iris an irritating bundle
of self-pity and anti-social behavior. But in Morton's hands the
character is both ferocious and mournful, naive and lascivious,
hurting and hurtful. This brave young actress makes Iris the lost
poster girl of Generation Duh.

LOW BUDGET, HIGH THRILLS: ``PI'' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Pi,'' a thriller, is rated R for language and disturbing
images. Running time is 1 hour 25 minutes. Three out of four stars.
</P>
<P>
   There's no need for big bucks or cutting-edge technology when
you've got great ideas and the skill to present them forcefully.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit No. 1: Darren Aronofsky's ``Pi,'' an absorbing
metaphysical horror story filmed for an incredibly cheap $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   And while the setup of this paranoid thriller about a nerdy
researcher who unlocks a secret code and is pursued by sinister
forces is familiar, the panache and originality with which
Aronofsky brings it off is little short of awe-inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   Max Cohen (Sean Gullette) is a bushy-haired stringbean obsessed
with numbers. He lives in a seedy Manhattan apartment crammed with
computers, monitors and mysterious electrical equipment. He rarely
goes out and has added numerous locks to his door to keep the world
at bay.
</P>
<P>
   He is, in fact, a sort of biological computer who without pencil
or calculator can instantaneously give the answer to complex
mathematical formulas. Now he's trying to prove his theory that
numbers are nature's universal language. Everything that happens in
this world can be represented mathematically, he reasons, and if
looked at from the proper perspective a numerical pattern will
always emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Currently Max is working on a formula that will allow him to
predict with absolute precision the behavior of the stock market.
He doesn't care about the money _ he cares about the pattern, the
divine order. Numbers.
</P>
<P>
   His one confidant is an aged professor, Sol (Mark Margolis), who
is disturbed by his former student's mania. ``Life isn't just
mathematics,'' advises Sol, who has been trying without success to
get Max to read ``Hamlet.''
</P>
<P>
   As is par for the course in yarns of this kind, Max actually
does stumble upon a series of numbers that seem to hold the answer
to, well, everything. But he can't enjoy his discovery. He's
pursued first by the thugs of a Wall Street firm that desperately
wants to exploit his discovery, then by Jewish cabalists who are
sure that Max's formula is the literal ``name of God.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes ``Pi'' so weirdly compelling is Aronofsky's depiction
of Max's insular world. Our protagonist is plagued by migraines and
seizures; he's a walking drugstore. We can't be sure if what we're
seeing really exists, or if it's the product of Max's fevered mind.
</P>
<P>
   The claustrophobic photography, captured in high-contrast black
and white, and the throbbing techno score by Clint Manswell give
``Pi'' a gritty, smothering immediacy. Max is not the sort of
character audiences warm up to, but Aronofsky keeps finding ways to
make his situation seem compelling and fraught with danger.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you flunked algebra and can't even countenance trig,
``Pi'' will prove an absorbing experience. The film's moral _ that
our humanity consists of much more than mere intellect and that
salvation lies in our connections to others _ may be a cliche, but
Aronofsky delivers it with a force and style that make it seem
fresh.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At one of the lowest points in his political life,
Bill Clinton looked into a television camera and apologized.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mistake,'' he said, ``because so many of you were
hurt by it, and I'm really sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   That was 16 years ago, and Clinton was talking about raising the
Arkansas vehicle license fee. The modest increase had been a key
factor in his defeat after one term as governor, and the apology
came as he prepared to run again _ and restart a career that took
him to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Clinton faces a new personal and political crossroads,
he is being urged to deliver another apology _ or at least a
detailed explanation _ in the Monica Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   Even as official White House spokesmen stand behind the
president's denial of a sexual relationship with the one-time White
House intern, former Clinton aides and allies on Capitol Hill are
calling for a personal, unambiguous statement from the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he lied, he should tell all, apologize and hope for the
best,'' George Stephanopoulos, a former senior adviser, writes in
Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
   It's called the ``mea culpa'' scenario, Latin for ``my fault.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the White House attempts to dampen expectations that
Clinton will take such a course in tandem with his grand jury
testimony Aug. 17, longtime Clinton observers are uncertain what to
expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think he'll do the mea culpa,'' David Gergen, a former
Clinton adviser, said on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press.'' ``I think now
that we've reached the crunch point, he'll step up to it. I think
he's that kind of man.''
</P>
<P>
   But acknowledgment of mistakes has never come easily for
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Dumas, a former columnist for the Arkansas Gazette who
has observed Clinton's entire political career, recalled that the
1982 apology was delivered in a campaign context and was unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember, offhand, anything else on which he accepted
responsibility for a major mistake,'' Dumas said.
</P>
<P>
   As for apologizing in the Lewinsky matter, Dumas said, ``I've
assumed all along that he wouldn't, unless there is
incontrovertible proof that would make it hard for him to
stonewall.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Barry Toiv said Clinton is ``aware of
some'' of the calls for him to speak to the nation about his
relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokeswoman Amy Weiss Tobe has denied a published
report that Clinton chief of staff Erskine Bowles had sounded out
Democrats in Congress about whether Clinton should make a major
speech explaining his relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said the subject
did not come up when Clinton met with House Democrats on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has not ruled out a presidential address on
Lewinsky, although Toiv said he was ``not aware of any plans at
this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is apparently conferring with so few people about the
Lewinsky situation that a decision to make a national address would
be held closely until the latest possible moment.
</P>
<P>
   From the outside, some analysts see a need for Clinton to make a
bold move before he testifies to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he absolutely has to do something before Aug. 17,''
said John Zogby, a polling specialist. ``He has to take the sting
out of his appearance. He has to trump it somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1992 presidential campaign, Clinton used an
extraordinary appearance on ``60 Minutes'' to all but acknowledge
extramarital affairs.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Clinton adviser James Carville said the risky
public appearance was required to allow the campaign to attempt to
get past allegations of sexual impropriety.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to do it,'' Carville said. ``We couldn't get our
message out.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may be beginning to face a similar situation now.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he retains high job-performance ratings in national
surveys, the public is demonstrating a desire for candor on
Clinton's part, apparently in hope of ending the investigation of
independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest NBC-Wall Street Journal survey, 56 percent of
respondents said Clinton ``should address the American people.''
And in a CNN-Time survey, 69 percent said that if Clinton admits to
a sexual relationship with Lewinsky and apologizes, Starr's
investigation should end. Only 27 percent said the inquiry should
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Several polls found that if Clinton admits to a sexual
relationship with Lewinsky, it would have no effect on how a
majority of respondents view the president.
</P>
<P>
   Less clear from the published polling is how Clinton should
approach an apology.
</P>
<P>
   The CNN-Time survey suggests the worst thing Clinton could do,
if he admits having sex with Lewinsky, is to offer no explanation
at all. In that case, 12 percent said they would be more likely to
forgive him, with 39 percent less likely. For 44 percent, it would
make no difference.

   Glenn Close and Marisa Tomei will be joined by actresses from
Bosnia and Herzegovina in a production of Eve Ensler's play
``Necessary Targets,'' the story of women traumatized by the war in
the former Yugoslavia, on Saturday at the National Theater in
Sarajevo. The production is part of the Suada's Bridge Project, a
citizens' diplomacy mission to mobilize resources for female war
victims in the region. The afternoon before the performance, Ms.
Close and Ms. Tomei will join Muslim, Serbian and Croatian women at
Suada's Bridge, named for Suada Dilberovic, a medical student in
Sarajevo who, as the Bosnian conflict's first civilian casualty,
was killed on the bridge on April 6, 1992, while protesting the
Balkan war.

   Royal watchers can suds up with the Queen _ or at least a
likeness of her _ when Buckingham Palace, the London home of Queen
Elizabeth II, opens to the public Thursday for the sixth
consecutive year. Touted as the main attraction: the souvenir shop
with products bearing likenesses of royal family members, including
reproductions of 17th-century porcelain, chocolate bars and, yes,
bath soap. The palace is publicizing itself for the first time with
posters in London's subway system. But there will be no chatting up
the royal family; they've taken up summer quarters at Balmoral
Castle in Scotland, where the climate is more cordial. In lieu of a
personal audience, the palace is offering a video about the
Windsors for (PS)10, approximately $16. Admission costs about the
same.

   Glorious Finale

   The Requiem was the final masterpiece of Mozart's short life,
written as he approached death and leaving controversy about its
authorship in its wake. Perhaps fittingly, the New Jersey Symphony
will close its Amadeus Festival '98 with the work, to feature the
Pro Arte Chorale and soloists Margret Cahn, Jennifer Roderer, Glenn
Siebert and John Cheek under the direction of Zdenek Macal.
Performances are Thursday at 7:30 p.m. and Saturday at 8 p.m. in
Prudential Hall at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark,
and Friday at 8 p.m. in Richardson Auditorium in Princeton, N.J.
Tickets, from $15 to $35, can be purchased by calling (800)

   Dueling Bagpipes
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimate that nearly 400,000 people will stampede the
city of Lorient in the French region of Brittany to hear oddities
like techno-bagpipes as the 28th InterCeltic Festival begins
Friday. Among the musicians leading the bill at the festival, which
promises to unite more than 4,500 artists, will be Alan Stivell,
whose works fuse Celtic, rock and techno music, including those
bagpipes; Dan Ar Braz, who routinely performs with a backup band of
60, and the jazz violinist Didier Lockwood. The festival runs
through Aug. 16.

 300 YARDS AND STILL GOING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RON DICKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ralph Di Pietro traveled four hours from Toronto to a driving
range in Cicero, N.Y., for this moment. A zephyr was pushing the
flags to attention at the mobile home dealer across the street. The
sky was clearing after a morning thunderstorm. The conditions were
such that if the collision of titanium and Titleist were exactly
right, Di Pietro would launch his best shot.
</P>
<P>
   Di Pietro repeatedly made like a pretzel with an exaggerated
backswing and whipped the club from his heels. The balls sprayed
everywhere except straight and far.
</P>
<P>
   ``At any time, any person can win it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This is a weekend routine for Di Pietro, a former minor-league
hockey player who satisfies his competitive urges by entering
long-drive contests.
</P>
<P>
   Di Pietro's wife, Debbie, with paperback in hand, planted a lawn
chair near the tee for what would be an all-day affair. She would
follow him the next week to another long-drive contest in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to miss out if he ever did crank it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tournaments for distance-hitting have flourished on the fringe
of the golf boom. The long tour began with the Re/Max World Long
Drive Championship in 1994 with eight qualifying sites, 100
competitors and $27,000 at stake. This year, the summerlong playoff
has more than 300 qualifying sites, 7,000 entrants and $250,000 in
total prize money _ $75,000 to the winner. The next local qualifier
is Sunday at the Darlington Golf Course in Mahwah, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The championship, in Mesquite, Nev., Oct. 21-24, is scheduled to
be broadcast by ESPN on Christmas Day, and the show has earned a
rating of 1.3, twice the rating the network gets for any of the
senior tour events it televises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to see the big hitters,'' said Randy Souza,
co-owner of the Long Drivers of America. ``People will follow John
Daly and Tiger Woods around even if Corey Pavin is winning.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is a better long driver than Jason Zuback. Zuback, a
5-foot-10-inch, 215-pound power lifter from Drayton Valley in the
Canadian province of Alberta, is the two-time defending long-drive
champion and consistently hammers the ball more than 400 yards.
Many pros would leap out of their double-knits at the thought of
driving the ball 300 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The club head of choice is made of titanium and the shaft is
graphite and often longer than conventional drivers. The players
come in all sizes. Taller athletes naturally generate more leverage
while the shorter hitters like Zuback compensate with strength
training to increase their club velocity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine Arnold Schwarzenegger with a golf game,'' said Brian
Ciampichini, organizer of the contest in Cicero, about 15 miles
north of Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Zuback has become such an attraction that he has given up his
job as a pharmacist to give exhibitions. Purists may sniff at the
spectacle of a driving-range Mark McGwire, but, Zuback said by
phone, ``Typically, they're the people who can't hit it very far.''
</P>
<P>
   The sport attracts a smattering of the curious. More than 1,800
attended last year's championship in Mesquite. The recent gathering
in Cicero drew about 40. Bob Gilkey, a 71-year-old local, braved
six hours of sauna-like weather to see the hopefuls take their
whacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to watch guys who do things you can't do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours into the competition, Gilkey got what he came for.
Craig Mabee, who owns an indoor golf range in nearby Binghamton,
N.Y., crushed a ball that disappeared into the ether. Mabee dropped
his club in disbelief. ``Keep going,'' he said. ``It's out of the
airport.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials found the ball nestled in a patch of golden rod far
beyond where folks were expected to reach. The measurement: 341
yards 1 foot 2 inches. It was no Zuback, but it was enough to send
Mabee to the district final, one stage away from Mesquite.

 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long before Jacquelyn Mitchard won the equivalent of the
literary trifecta, she led her life as a memoir in progress. She
was a newly widowed mother of five whose daily dramas were so
unnerving that at one point her best friend threatened to ``break
up'' with her.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the lightning shock of an endorsement from Oprah
Winfrey, who featured Ms. Mitchard on her television book club in
October 1996, increasing the hardcover copies in print of her debut
novel, ``The Deep End of the Ocean,'' from 100,000 to more than
915,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath, Ms. Mitchard hired a personal trainer, bought
a three-bedroom Cape Cod retreat and watched her imaginary
characters draw oxygen from movie stars like Michelle Pfeiffer,
Whoopi Goldberg and Treat Williams. (The film is to open in the
fall.)
</P>
<P>
   She wrote a second novel involving a 40-ish woman who falls in
love with a young carpenter; on May 13, Ms. Mitchard, 45, married a
32-year-old carpenter, two months after he came to her Madison,
Wis., home to set the bathroom tile.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Ms. Mitchard left on a 19-city tour to promote her
second novel, ``The Most Wanted,'' and there among the bookshelves
discovered the fickle nature of her good fortune: The vast majority
of Ms. Winfrey's viewers were obviously not buying her new book.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like `The Deep End of the Ocean' is a human being,
and that by reading another book by me, readers feel like it would
be leaving their first love for another guy,'' Ms. Mitchard said.
``It's like my own worst enemy. I just want to laugh like a fool,
and say, shoot, I feel like the Ricky Nelson of novelists. Nobody
wants to hear anything but `Mary Lou.'''
</P>
<P>
   As the first author to be anointed by Ms. Winfrey, Ms. Mitchard
leads an elite and fortunate group of more than a dozen authors who
experienced a rush of popularity, with sales increasing by up to
1,000 percent for newly published titles and some older books
dating as far back as 20 years. Among the featured writers have
been Maya Angelou, Ernest Gaines, Toni Morrison and Wally Lamb, a
former high school teacher whose two novels were selected for the
show.
</P>
<P>
   A self-described ``Janie come lately,'' Ms. Mitchard is a tardy
bloomer with auburn hair, long flowing skirts and dusky brown eyes
edged by laugh lines of experience. She achieved her success as a
novelist despite entreaties from some relatives and friends to set
aside imaginary tales for a steady day job after her husband of 13
years, Dan Allegretti, died of colon cancer in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   She was struggling to pay for repairs on a deteriorating roof
with her freelance job as a columnist for The Milwaukee Journal and
a part-time public relations position at the University of
Wisconsin. But Ms. Mitchard ignored those pleas and took a risk _
just as she also refused to reconsider her decision to adopt a baby
in the raw period after her husband died.
</P>
<P>
   It was that step that prompted her best friend, Hannah
Rosenthal, to make her threat to ``break up,'' because she had
promised the dying Allegretti that she would discourage Ms.
Mitchard from adopting another child.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all worried about her,'' remembered Ms. Rosenthal, who said
her friends were particularly concerned about Ms. Mitchard's
finances. ``Even though we know Jackie is a very good writer, we
all know that most journalists think they have the great American
novel in them and we didn't know whether it would work.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the encouragement of another Wisconsin author, Jane
Hamilton, Ms. Mitchard retreated in late 1994 to an artist's colony
outside Chicago called the Ragdale Foundation to write the first
two chapters of ``The Deep End of the Ocean,'' a wrenching story of
a family's grief and shattered life after the kidnapping of a
3-year-old boy at a hotel where his mother was checking in for a
high school reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should take more risks,'' Ms. Mitchard said of her
decision to write her novel. ``I think it's prescriptive. And
people should have the courage of their dreams, because we are so
willing to be defeated.''
</P>
<P>
   A month later, in November 1994, her first two chapters enticed
a New York publisher, Viking, to offer Ms. Mitchard a $500,000
advance for a two-book contract, a guarantee of financial security
that allowed her to focus on her fiction writing.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Pfeiffer's production company optioned the manuscript
before it was published, but not even the offer of a movie deal
could compare with the impact of Ms. Winfrey, who after reading the
book left messages on Ms. Mitchard's answering machine that
initially went unanswered because the author thought her friends
were playing a joke.
</P>
<P>
   After Ms. Mitchard's appearance on Ms. Winfrey's show in the
fall of 1996, over a dinner of glazed cherry chicken and sugar snap
peas with selected readers and the host, Viking would go back to
press nearly 20 times, printing 900,000 copies in hardcover and
more than 2 million in paperback.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, her second novel has sold at a more leisurely pace
resembling the pre-Oprah patterns of ``The Deep End of the Ocean,''
said Barbara Grossman, Ms. Mitchard's publisher at Viking. She said
that Viking had lowered its expectations for the second book,
reducing the number of copies printed to 400,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize until months later how profound the effect
had been on me in terms of my profile as a writer,'' Ms. Mitchard
said. ``At first, I thought it was just kind of a giggle, and I
knew the the book would be affected positively. But I had no idea
that it was as if I had grown this luminous green skin that
everyone could see except me. It wasn't until months later that I
realized that all of us were part of this band of people who had
been struck by lightning, to the extent that it was an unrealistic
beginning for a career as a fiction writer.''
</P>
<P>
   Her experience was not unlike that of her friend Ms. Hamilton,
whose 1988 novel, ``The Book of Ruth,'' (Houghton Mifflin) was also
selected for promotion on Oprah's book club. Ms. Hamilton, who
lives on an apple orchard west of Racine, said that her television
appearance gave her ``a zillion readers'' for `The Book of Ruth,' a
bounty of letters from men in prison and, fortunately, a financial
cushion that forestalled ``a career as a Kmart checkout girl.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said it did not result in much spillover for her third
novel, ``The Short History of a Prince,'' published this year.
</P>
<P>
   Given that Ms. Mitchard has long acknowledged life's dramatic
possibilities, she has been relatively unfazed by the swings in her
career. From the time she was young, she said she has considered
her life material for storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea why I see my life _ and all life _ as a
story,'' she said. ``But to have a story you have to have something
going on, and there have been times when I have wished there
weren't quite so many chapters.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's difficult for those around her to accept her
sense of daring and adventure, said Ms. Mitchard's neighbor, Jean
Marie Kammer, a nurse who was with her when her husband died.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jackie has a lot of courage,'' Ms. Kammer said. ``But her
courage isn't understood by many other people. I think they would
label it something else _ impulsive. I see it with a lot of love.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Mitchard, the recurring theme in her fiction and her
Sunday newspaper columns is a ferocious zest for motherhood. As she
herself put it, she has managed to be a catch-all matriarch, ``of
sons, of daughters, adoptive, high-tech medical, single, working,
soccer and step.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, she wrote a brutally frank nonfiction book, ``Mother
Less Child,'' (W.W. Norton &AMP; Co.) which explored her stubborn and
impatient efforts to conceive a child through infertility
treatments after nearly dying as the result of a tubal pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   She and her first husband, Allegretti, who had a daughter from
another marriage, then tried to adopt a baby, only to give up that
child to another couple after discovering that the newborn suffered
from Down syndrome. Together she and Allegretti adopted two sons,
and later conceived a boy through in-vitro fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   Against the advice of her father, she adopted Francie Nolan in
1995; she said she named the girl for the character in ``A Tree
Grows in Brooklyn.'' Her second novel is dedicated not only to
Francie but also to Francie's biological mother. Although she
writes and speaks openly about her children, Ms. Mitchard asked
that their faces not be photographed for use with this article.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mitchard said that motherhood was important to her because
writers tend to be lonely people, and a child offered ``a powerful
and consuming love outside the realm of the solitary mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Bob Mitchard, a retired Chicago plumber, said he was
very ``much against her adopting Francie.'' But with her marriage
to Christopher Brent Sornberger _ which took place in a civil
ceremony and was observed in a second ceremony attended by her
children, ages 23, 14, 12, 9 and 2 _ Ms. Mitchard said she did not
rule out adopting another child.
</P>
<P>
   Her sudden marriage, which her father bluntly described as
``nuts,'' has also prompted her to think more deeply about another
potential drama: Should she donate a kidney to her father, who is
ailing and in his 70s?
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my daughter very deeply,'' said Mitchard, ``but right
at this point, I'm a little upset that she refuses my chance at
another 10 to 15 years. She said, `Chris and I are discussing it,'
and I said, `She's known him for three months.'''
</P>
<P>
   The author said she and her father were mulling over their
options. In Ms. Mitchard's life, this is a chapter that remains to
be lived.

DRUG CUTS SPREAD OF BREAST CANCER   TO BONES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   A new drug has dramatically reduced the spread of breast cancer
to the bones in women who were at high risk for mestastases,
European scientists say, and, in a striking surprise, it also
lessened the cancer's spread to other organs.
</P>
<P>
   Breast cancer specialists were cautiously hopeful that the drug,
which is not yet available in the United States, or similar
compounds in a class called bisphosphonates might become standard
weapons capable of preventing metastases in some women.
</P>
<P>
   But they said that the relatively small study needs to repeated
by other researchers and the benefits weighed against the nausea
and other gastrointestinal problems that are side effects of the
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Bisphosphonate drugs are used to treat osteoporosis, and they
have in recent years been shown to reduce bone metastases in women
with breast cancer that has already begun to spread to the
skeleton. One of the drugs, pamidronate, has been increasingly
prescribed to ease the often severe pain that bone metastases can
create as they erode and weaken bone and sometimes lead to
fractures.
</P>
<P>
   But the article in the current issue of the New England Journal
of Medicine is the first to report the bisphosphonates can be
effective earlier in the course of breast cancer, before any
metastases have yet been discovered.
</P>
<P>
   And the study is the first to find that the drugs can block
metastases to non-skeletal organs like the liver. The authors of
the report, headed by Dr. Ingo J. Diel, are from the German
universities of Heidelberg and Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   The women in the study were 302 patients, ranging in age from 24
to 78, who had breast cancer and were considered likely to develop
metastases because tumor cells were found in their bone marrow.
Metastases are colonies of malignant cells that break off from the
main tumor and travel through the circulation to lodge and grow
elsewhere. They are often the main cause of death from a cancer.
</P>
<P>
   All the women had been treated with surgery and radiation and
most had chemotherapy as well. Half the patients received daily
oral doses of the bisphosphonate drug clodronate, which has not yet
been approved for use in the United States. The remaining patients
received standard treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Over a three-year period, doctors found distant metastases in 21
women in the group taking clodronate and 42 women in the control
group. In 12 women in the clodronate group the metastases were to
bones while 13 were to other organs. Among the controls, 25 women
had bony metastases and in 27 cancer had spread to other organs.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two women (15 percent) in the control died, compared with
six women (4 percent) in the clodronate group.
</P>
<P>
   The reduction in non-bony metastases ``was unexpected,'' the
researchers wrote. ``This effect has never been seen in experiments
in animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Tumor cells from primary breast cancers evidently send chemical
signals to bone cells called osteoclasts that break down the
surface of the bone and ``make a new surface that is now an ideal
environment for the breast cancer cell to sit down on,'' said Dr.
Michael Holick, who heads the bone health care clinic at Boston
Medical Center. Bisphosphonates appear to work by blocking these
signals, thus reducing metastases.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not clear why the drugs should curb metastases to
non-bony organs, the authors of the study wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Eric Winer, director of the breast oncology center at
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, called the study ``very
provocative.'' But he added that it included relatively few
patients who were observed for only three years, and said the
results should be documented by others before similar drugs are
routinely prescribed for breast cancer patients. ``I just don't
think we should be jumping to use these drugs outside of studies,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Winer said that pamidronate, or Aredia, which is one of three
bisphosphonate drugs approved in the United States, helps reduce
pain and fractures in women who already have bony metastases. And
other Dana-Farber researchers are enrolling men with advanced
prostate cancer _ which commonly spreads to bone _ in a trial of
Aredia to determine whether it can reduce pain and other
complications of prostate cancer bony metastases.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gabriel Hortobagyi, a breast cancer researcher at M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center in Houston who headed a 1996 study on the
use of bisphosphonates in breast cancer, called the new paper
``very exciting.'' But he said a Canadian study found somewhat less
dramatic results in a large group of breast cancer patients, and
agreed that further studies are essential.

<P>
   MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. _ Sonji Thomas of Kingstree started working
at the Pavilion Amusement Park in this popular beach resort in late
May, after finishing her junior year at Columbia College, a small
liberal arts school in this state's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Earning $6.25 an hour for everything from taking tickets to
filling in for co-workers on break, she said, ``I've earned money,
made friends and met a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   She would have made even more if her roommate had not quit her
summer job in late July, effectively leaving Miss Thomas to
shoulder the entire $170 a week apartment rental herself _ an
amount equal to two-thirds of her weekly salary.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she reluctantly returned home to prepare for the start
of school on August 26 _ leaving the Pavilion to fill the void left
by Miss Thomas and the rest of the park's 475 seasonal employees
who quit before summer's end.
</P>
<P>
   Syreeta Owens, 18, of Marion, is planning her own departure from
the Pavilion next week in order to begin her freshman year at
Winthrop University in Rock Hill on Aug. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, at resorts and parks throughout the United States,
the late-summer void left by American students is being staffed by
retirees and foreign students, whose school terms often begin later
in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   While most retired workers work only part time, they have become
essential to the seasonal tourist industry, especially during a
period of low unemployment. The retirees are vital in national and
state parks in October, after the students depart and millions of
visitors arrive to view the changing leaves. And any number of
amusement parks, from Dollywood in Pigeon Forge, Tenn., to Six
Flags Great Adventure and Safari in Jackson, N.J., roll out the
welcome mat for retired people.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the number of employees 50 and over at Six Flags, New
Jersey's biggest seasonal employer, has more than doubled to about
600 since 1996. And this year, for the first time, Sea World of
Florida _ whose 900 part-time workers include many retirees _ is
offering part-timers who have worked six consecutive months the
choice of cash bonuses or either of two medical insurance plans.
</P>
<P>
   At his post beside a collection of amusement park antique autos
in the Pavilion at Myrtle Beach, where he and his wife, Minnie,
work as ride operators, Joseph McCracken, a 74-year-old retired
farmer with a pacemaker, said he was well satisfied to be working
at the park at his age and in his condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farming's never done,'' he said, explaining that both he and
his wife spent years behind a mule, plowing their 35-acre farm in
Aynor. ``In all that time we never had a vacation. This is a
vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Basden, the head of human resources for Burroughs &AMP; Chapin,
the company that owns the Pavilion and many other attractions here,
said: ``It's usually a problem getting college students to stay
through Labor Day. But it has never been as much of a problem as
this year, mostly because there are so many job openings in Myrtle
Beach and not enough people to fill them. People will quit to go
someplace else for a nickel or a dime. And these aren't experienced
workers, a lot of them are kids with their first job, and a lot of
them still lack social skills.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pavilion, in order to retain student workers, gives a bonus
to every seasonal employee who stays until Labor Day, and a
scholarship bonus of up to $2,500 for employees who work at the
park four consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
   As if to underscore the labor shortage, restaurants, motels,
souvenir shops, pizza parlors and convenience markets all along
Route 17 and Ocean Boulevard, this city's two main roads, are
plastered with help wanted signs, often with assurances that
experience is not necessary.
</P>
<P>
   But Myrtle Beach is not unique when it comes to a shortage of
summer help, only that its problem is exacerbated by the fact that
it draws some 13 million tourists a year, most of them in summer.
</P>
<P>
   Employers in tourist destinations are scrambling as never before
to hire seasonal employees and to retain those they have. Not only
was the 4.7 percent unemployment rate in June the lowest in almost
30 years, but high schools and colleges increasingly begin fall
sports practice and even classes by the third week of August, often
because they have longer breaks during the school year. And,
employers report, many students spurn entry-level salaries for
vacations of their own or for summer internships, even unpaid
internships.
</P>
<P>
   To lure even inexperienced workers, many hard-pressed employers
are offering $6 or more an hour, or at least 85 cents above the
$5.15 national minimum wage _ and as much as $7 or $8 for cooks,
chambermaids and security guards. Many employers recruit retired
men and women at job fairs, or hire the many foreign students who
arrive through student exchange employment programs, or,
increasingly, simply turn up asking for a job.
</P>
<P>
   When all else fails, or simply to prevent a labor shortage, many
employers are offering inducements practically unheard of a year or
two ago. For example:
</P>
<P>
   _At Universal Studios in Orlando, employees who stay until at
least the third week in August are eligible for a drawing whose
prizes include a 1998 Chevrolet Tracker, a four-day Caribbean
cruise for two, a free flight for two anywhere in the United States
and cash awards of $5,000, $3,000 and $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   _Elitch Gardens amusement park in Denver budgets up to $5,000
for scholarships, the amount depending on length of service, and
recently began helping students apply for federal aid and student
loans for which they are eligible.
</P>
<P>
   _At Lake Powell, the vast recreation area on the border of
Arizona and Utah, the Aramark Corp., the park concessionaire based
in Philadelphia, pays an additional 25 cents an hour to employees
who fulfill their summer contracts in a lump sum at the end of the
summer. In addition, employees are treated to luaus and barbecues,
and given free use of a houseboat for a week.
</P>
<P>
   _The Inn on Lake Superior, in Duluth, Minn., pays about $5.50 an
hour _ but adds an additional $1 an hour to an employee's tuition
fund, up to $500 a year.
</P>
<P>
   _At Yellowstone National Park, new workers start at $5.25 an
hour, but are given subsidized room and board. They are also
allowed to arrange their two days off a week to fall at the end of
one week and the beginning of the next. Even at that, to fill the
park's 2,600 positions throughout the summer requires Amfac Parks
and Resorts of Aurora, Colo., the park concessionaire, to hire
3,400 people.
</P>
<P>
   _Ocean City, N.J., where the beach patrol dwindles from 125
lifeguards early in the season to fewer than 50 by Labor Day,
recently sent invitations to ``all old guards who are interested in
returning to guard part-time in August.'' The city expects about 25
old-timers, about the same as last summer, among them teachers,
airline pilots and other professionals.

 &HT;    CLINTON, DEMOCRATS UPBEAT AT CAPITOL CAUCUS
 &HT;    540&AMP;add.

 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Rep. John Lewis ushered President Clinton down
the marble hallway of the Cannon Office Building to meet with House
Democrats for the first time since agreeing to testify to a grand
jury about his relationship with a former White House intern, he
was struck by the president's air of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the president is facing perhaps the most
treacherous waters of his political career, Clinton appeared ``more
upbeat than I've ever seen him,'' said Lewis, a Georgian who serves
as the party's chief deputy whip in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was business as usual. He didn't seem concerned about what
Ken Starr is doing or his own upcoming testimony _ he was all Bill
Clinton,'' Lewis said. ``It was almost like a Democratic Party
rally _ hugging, shaking hands. When he came into the room, he lit
it up.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the question of whether the president had a sexual
encounter with Monica Lewinsky, the former intern, did not even
surface during the 90-minute meeting with the Democratic caucus,
said Lewis and other Democrats in attendance. Neither did the
looming question of whether an independent counsel would be
appointed to investigate the campaign fund-raising practices of the
Clinton White House.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raising scandal and Lewinsky, who is scheduled to
testify Thursday about her relationship with the president, both
took a back seat to such public policy initiatives such as Social
Security, education, budget surpluses and managed care.
</P>
<P>
   Even Charles Stenholm, the conservative Texas Democrat who has
not hesitated in the past to criticize his party elders, emerged
from the party-pumping session with nothing but praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun to be part of the team again,'' Stenholm told the
gathering. Reflecting afterward, Stenholm said there was a general
sense among the conservatives in the party that ``we are part of a
family.''
</P>
<P>
   As for why questions about Lewinsky did not surface, Stenholm
echoed others in saying that he is ``perfectly willing to wait
until August 17th (when the president is scheduled to testify),
when I believe the facts will become known. I believe you are
innocent until proven guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Paul Kanjorski of Pennsylvania said Lewinsky did not
come up because ``unlike the press, we (the Democrats) realize we
have a process under way.'' He urged the media to ``go home and
look in the mirror,'' because the public is not concerned about the
scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans viewed the Democrats' newfound unity with
skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were in their shoes, I'd want to change the subject
too,'' said a bemused John Linder, R-Ga.. He cited the
investigation into whether a large Democratic donor put the
nation's security at risk by transferring sensitive technology to
China, the ongoing investigation into campaign fund-raising
violations, and the question of whether the president did not tell
the truth under oath about his relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Linder, who heads up the House Republican campaign committee,
said Clinton probes are taking their toll on the American public
and will help the GOP in the fall elections. ``I think the American
people are in a state of shock about these lurid allegations;
they're fed up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   As he introduced the president, Vice President Al Gore quoted
House Speaker Newt Gingrich's comment to a Capitol Hill publication
that the House should pass a resolution to keep the government
running, and then go home to their districts. Gore chided the
speaker by saying, ``we ought to send him home, home for good.''
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from the session, Democrats lambasted Gingrich for
leading ``the party of investigations'' while they are ``the party
of issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich responded by saying, ``The choice is simple:
Republicans are the party of safer Social Security, lower taxes,
smaller government and stronger national defense. Democrats are the
party of weaker Social Security, higher taxes, bigger government
and a hollow national defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the contrast between the two parties, Gingrich said that
it is ``easy to understand why the Democrats are resorting to
desperate words and desperate stunts like threats to shut down the
government. It should be a colorful fall in more ways than one.''

 MYRTLE BEACH, S.C.: other professionals.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   But if Ocean City's invitation is somewhat unusual, in that
lifeguards usually conjure up images of youth, summer businesses
would have a hard time operating this summer _ other than on a
vastly reduced scale _ without retirees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use a lot of retired people, especially when we start
losing employees in mid-August,'' said Terry Slowinski, regional
general manager for Aramark, which operates the refreshment
concessions and catering services at Lake Powell, Alaska's Denali
National Park and a dozen other national and state parks.
</P>
<P>
   Akane Nagatomo, 22, who has been working at Lake Powell since
May and plans to remain until Labor Day, said, ``I noticed older
people working here, and it's impressive how much they accomplish
and how much they seem to be enjoying themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most of the foreign workers holding summer jobs up and
down the Atlantic seaboard who come from Europe, Miss Nagatomo is
from the island of Kyushu in Japan. Majoring in hospitality at Mesa
State College in Grand Junction, Colo., she earns $5.75 an hour at
Lake Powell plus dormitory housing, while fulfilling the 540 hours
required of her internship. Many other parks, including amusement
parks, offer internships to students, as do many hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Except for occasional ``strays'' who turn up, most foreign
students arrive with J-1 visas allowing them to work and travel in
the United States for up to four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically a program that allows the kids to learn
English,'' said Casey Slamin, project manager of Interexchange,
which has been bringing foreign students to work in the United
States for more than 20 years. This summer, he said, Interexchange
has brought in about 3,500 such workers, most of them from Europe.
In the winter, when the seasons and the school year are reversed in
the Southern Hemisphere, it brings in college students from
Australia, South Africa and Latin America to work in ski resorts.
</P>
<P>
   Despite periodic demands that America tighten its immigration
policy, there appears to have been little or no backlash against
foreign college students _ not just because of the shortage of
home-grown workers this summer, but also because ``most employers
want to internationalize their work staff,'' Slamin said, ``so even
during high unemployment, foreign workers would still fill a
niche.''
</P>
<P>
   A big reason for hiring foreign students, employers here and
elsewhere say, is that European colleges do not usually start
before October. Peter Nolan, an electrical engineering major at
University College Cork in Cork, Ireland, is not due back until
Oct. 5. He is a busboy at the Kansas Steak House here earning $5.25
an hour. ``I'm hoping to become a server,'' he said, ``because they
make good tips.''

   AIDS-ZIMBABWE (Tsholotsho, Zimbabwe) _ This country has suddenly
turned into the deadly center of the AIDS epidemic. Recent studies
now suggest that Zimbabwe may have the highest infection rate on
earth. The optimism of the West is a cruel fantasy here. Here there
is no treatment, no cure, little hope and _ in almost every country
on this continent _ far more pressing problems to face each day.
The savage virus has left few people untouched: It has devastated
families, communities and cities. But seen through the weary and
often bloodshot eyes of the beleaguered doctors and nurses who must
attend to the sick people around them, AIDS is just another word
for dying _ and it's just another disease. By Michael Specter.

CHINESE AMBASSADOR SNUBS CONGRESS ON HUMAN RIGHTS PARLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE TSONG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Chinese ambassador snubbed a House subcommittee
Wednesday, backing out of a planned meeting to talk about human
rights in China after complaining that the panel had violated
ground rules he had insisted on.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Ambassador Li Zhaoxing told the House subcommittee on
international relations and human rights 20 minutes before the
start of the session that Li would not appear, according to Rep.
Christopher Smith, R-N.J., chair of the subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ambassador Li has stiffed the committee,'' Smith announced at
the beginning of what would have been the first congressional
discussion on human rights with Li, who arrived last March.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a strong critic of China, said the incident ``raises
grave doubts about the value of a promise made by a representative
of the Chinese government.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese embassy had insisted on three conditions for Li's
appearance, Smith said. Chinese diplomats demanded that:
</P>
<P>
   _ House members sit at a table on the same level as the
ambassador instead of sitting on the raised dais normally used in
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   _ No other witnesses could be invited.
</P>
<P>
   _ The House couldn't call the meeting a ``hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the subcommittee complied with all three. Chairs for
the House members and for the ambassador were placed at the same
level in the House meeting room, no other people were invited to
speak and the two official House announcements about the session
called it a ``meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he received a facsimile Tuesday from the embassy
complaining that the subcommittee had used the word ``hearing'' to
publicize the session. The embassy cited a Congressional Quarterly
publication that referred to a ``hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he replied with a facsimile assuring Li ``that no
employee of mine or of the subcommittee's had used the forbidden
`h-word' to describe the meeting.'' He said he sent the embassy the
two House announcements about the meeting to show that there were
no references to a ``hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith also said he told the Chinese that the United States is a
free country and that Congress cannot control what words media
outlets might use to describe a proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday morning, an embassy aide told Smith that Li was not
coming, according to Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Later, embassy officials told a news conference that there were
indications that the ``meeting'' was really a ``hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Huo Mingwu, a congressional liaison with the embassy, showed
reporters a subcommittee announcement that identified the
ambassador as a witness and said that indicated that the House
viewed the session as a ``hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is a meeting, how could there be a witness?'' Huo said.
</P>
<P>
   Yu Shuning, a spokesperson for the embassy, said the difference
between a hearing and a meeting is the presence of a witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hearing would have witnesses questioned by members of the
committee or subcommittee,'' Yu said. ``He or she would not have
the right to have ... an exchange of views on an equal footing.''
</P>
<P>
   The embassy suggested that Li would meet with members of
Congress in Smith's office or in the Chinese embassy.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese embassy would not object to media coverage, but they
do not want a ``late-night talk show in front of Congress,'' said
Zhang Keyuan, another embassy aide.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing to hide, we have nothing to fear,'' Zhang
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., the top Democrat on the subcommittee,
said the human rights meeting was not intended to intimidate the
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose is not to embarrass (Li), but to open up a
substantive discussion'' on human rights, Lantos told reporters.
``This was not an unfriendly venue at all.''

<P>
   The issue of human rights in China created an uproar in Congress
earlier this year when President Clinton made plans to visit China
despite claims by Chinese dissidents that the Beijing government
violated such human rights as freedom of religion and freedom of
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton raised the issue of human rights during his 10-day trip,
insisting that certain rights such as religious worship, the right
to voice opinions and the right to be treated with dignity are
universal.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he had planned to ask Li about the 1989 Tiananmen
Square massacre, as well as question the ambassador about forced
abortions in China and political and religious prisoners there.
</P>
<P>
   Smith reissued an invitation for Li to meet with the
subcommittee anytime in the future, and said he will do whatever he
can to have a discussion with the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they would have asked me to stand on my head, I would
have,'' he said. Smith also told reporters he will come back ``at
the drop of a hat'' during the August congressional recess if Li
accepts the invitation then.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Waldron, director of Asian Studies at the American
Enterprise Institute, a Washington-based think tank, said the
Chinese most likely did not want to talk about human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Telling the truth would be damning. Lying would be damning,''
he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   He said they probably think that people would be less upset
about an absentee ambassador than a candid discussion.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As an international relations student at Stanford University in
1982, Brad Howe often trolled the library stacks for the idle book
that would catch his interest. One day, he found a book that
changed his future.
</P>
<P>
   It was about Alexander Calder's mobiles and, as he tells it, it
inspired him to become a sculptor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They spoke so clearly to me that it made me want to respond,''
Howe said of the book's illustrations. ``I wanted to drop
everything and start making mobiles. I'm inspired by many artists
today, but the door to the art world was opened by Alexander
Calder.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, though, Howe and other mobile sculptors find themselves
in the odd position of having their works challenged by Calder's
estate. At its request, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art
plans to remove their mobiles from its gift shop during the major
Calder exhibition to be held there from Sept. 4 through Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Two other museums, the Whitney Museum of American Art in New
York and the Phillips Collection in Washington, have yanked mobiles
from their shops permanently, out of awareness of the estate's
concern that the public would not differentiate the objects from
Calder's work. The Whitney opened its new Calder gallery, which
features his famous ``Circus,'' in March, and the Phillips
currently has two Calder stabiles on loan from the artist's family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it offensive that the family of an artist would try to
prevent other artists from having access to the public,'' Howe
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Lerner, the lawyer for the estate, sees things
differently. ``These artists can go anywhere else,'' he said.
``During the period of the show, they'd be trading on the
reputation of Alexander Calder.''
</P>
<P>
   More fundamentally, though, the dispute raises the question of
whether the sculptural form shaped by Calder has been so identified
with him that those creating in his wake will forever be in the
position of having their originality questioned. It also cuts in
complicated ways at another issue: when a piece is so similar to
those of another artist that it infringes on a copyright.
</P>
<P>
   While Howe and other artists freely acknowledge they have drawn
from Calder's art, they say the end product is their own. Howe's
mobiles, for instance, use lime-green and pink _ shades not usually
associated with Calder's use of colors like red, black and blue.
``Calder created a vocabulary in kinetic sculpture,'' said Howe,
who lives in Los Angeles. ``My goal is not to create Calder. My
goal is to create kinetic sculpture that inspires.''
</P>
<P>
   The sentiment is one that gains a certain sympathy even at the
museums that have sided with the Calder estate. ``We are
sympathetic to the artist who feels his work is being displaced,''
said Lori Fogarty, the San Francisco museum's deputy director for
curatorial affairs. ``But ultimately we were more sympathetic to
the Calder family. When we are going to an artist's estate and
asking to borrow 100 works and relying on their generosity, we feel
very sympathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   The 270-work Calder retrospective, the first major showing of
his work since 1976, moves to the San Francisco museum after its
debut at the National Gallery of Art in Washington. More than
288,700 people attended the exhibition from March 29 to July 12,
said Deborah Ziska, a spokeswoman for the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fogarty said the Calder family's request to remove the
mobiles was included earlier this year with loan papers for the
show.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner said the sale of mobiles resembling Calder's during the
show would only confuse the public. Some visitors, he said, would
assume that the mobiles were reproductions licensed or endorsed by
the estate of Calder, who died in 1976. The estate does not usually
permit reproductions of Calder's mobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner said the estate did not intend to sue the mobile artists,
attempt to confiscate their works or prevent them from selling
elsewhere. ``We are bending over backward to be reasonable to
everybody,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Willard Holmes, the Whitney's acting director, said he had not
been asked directly to remove the gift-shop mobiles. ``We removed
those where we felt there was a legitimate concern they would cause
confusion in the visitor's mind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some museum officials say mobiles must meet certain esthetic
standards to be sold in their gift shops. ``There's a fine line
between fine arts and design objects,'' said Ms. Fogarty. ``For the
most part, our objects are very carefully selected. We don't sell
just any kind of design object.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Behind the esthetic questions are legal ones. In recent years,
dozens of artists and their estates have sued, charging copyright
infringement, to protect works from being reproduced on coffee
cups, beach towels and the like, and from being appropriated by
other artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't protect the integrity of the work, it loses its
value,'' said Theodore Feder, president of the Artists Rights
Society, a for-profit organization that represents artists' estates
and authorizes reproductions of works by Calder, Picasso, Matisse,
Pollock, Warhol and others. ``Anybody could imitate and sell it on
the marketplace. If you couldn't distinguish one from another, it
would be worth what the cheapest one is worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other artists, though, Calder not only created singular
works but also was the best-known innovator of the mobile as an art
form. Lawyers, art experts and artists disagree over what elements
of mobile art are so identified with Calder that they cannot be
used without violating copyright law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calder basically created a medium,'' said Regina Stewart,
executive director of the New York Artists Equity Association, a
nonprofit advocacy organization for visual artists. But, referring
to the estate, she added, ``It's also like they're saying, `Don't
use acrylic paint because I'm the first artist to use it.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the mobiles, however, Amy Schwartzman, executive
director of Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts in New York, said there
might be a copyright issue if the courts found the works to be
``substantially similar'' to Calder's and the artist had seen
Calder's work, even if the artist had not consciously copied it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can absolutely draw on something as inspiration, but you
cannot copy the image,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Rower, Calder's grandson, who helped organize the
Calder retrospective, said he did not know about the specific
request made to the San Francisco museum. But he said the family
had been concerned for years about the sale of Calder-esque
mobiles. ``I find them upsetting,'' he said. ``My grandfather, when
he made the work, he never wanted it reproduced.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Graham Sears, an artist who lives in Buffalo and whose work has
been sold at the San Francisco museum, said he experimented with
new shapes and forms. In one mobile, for instance, curved blue and
red disks float around a free-form black arch. ``My work is one of
a kind,'' he said. ``Every little turn of the file and snip of the
snippet _ it's all a considered motion.''
</P>
<P>
   Howe's mobiles and sculptures are featured in a 200-page book
about his work, ``Serious Exuberance,'' with an introduction by
Peter Frank, an art critic in Los Angeles, to be released in
December by Noriega Editores. Next month, 20 of his pieces will be
displayed in a show at the Jernigan Wicker Fine Arts gallery in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's certainly not an arts-and-crafts guy; he is a
well-established artist,'' said Cheryle Wicker, the gallery owner.
``His work is very modernist and extremely original.''
</P>
<P>
   At the gift shop of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New
York, however, customers have asked if mobiles by other artists
were Calder reproductions, said Patricia Burger, a sales associate.
The shop carries mobiles by Joel Hotchkiss _ swirls of brightly
colored metal bits, fabric forms and curled wire hung from the
ceiling _ each signed by the artist. They range in price from $145
to $425.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's confusing because, for some people, their first
impression of a mobile is Calder, and they never think of other
artists,'' said Ms. Burger, who said she was told by a supervisor
last year to avoid the word Calderesque when describing the
mobiles.
</P>
<P>
   More pressing than esthetic debate for some of the artists,
however, is a loss of income. Sue Lapin, an agent who represents
Howe and Sears, said she supplied about 10 mobiles a month, worth a
total of about $2,000, to the San Francisco museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hurt our business,'' said Sandra Hotchkiss, the wife and
business partner of Hotchkiss, who lives in West Stockbridge, Mass.
``I'm not giving anyone dollar numbers, but it's made an impact.
The more museums fall into this, the more it hurts small companies
like us making our own artwork.''

   GOVERNOR-LOCKE-CONTRIBUTIONS (Undated) Washington Gov. Gary
Locke says he did not knowingly receive $5,400 in campaign
contributions from from associates of a man suspected of supplying
Chinese government money to the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign. ``I
don't know any of these individuals, wouldn't recognize them if I
ran into them on the street,'' said Locke, who was deposed in the
congressional investigation on July 8. Locke's campaign fund
received five checks on July 29, 1996, soon after he paid a visit
to a Los Angeles-based Chinese-language newspaper owned by Ted
Sioeng, who has since fled the country, according to the Aug. 13
issue of the Far Eastern Economic Review. During questioning by
attorneys from the House Reform and Oversight Committee, Locke
became aware of an $1,100 contribution that that may have been
illegal and returned it last month.

CANADIAN `VILLAGE OF WIDOWS' REPRESENTED AT HIROSHIMA MEMORIAL

<P>
   DELINE, Northwest Territories _ When the white doves are loosed
in Hiroshima Thursday day in the annual rememberance of those
killed by the flash of atomic fire in 1945, a delegation of Dene
Indians from Canada's cancer-haunted ``village of widows'' will be
on hand to pay respects _ and express remorse.
</P>
<P>
   The Sahtugot'ine Dene of Deline, a desolate hamlet of 700 on the
western shore of Great Bear Lake, are a people ridden by a terrible
sense of responsibility for the atomic attacks against Japan, which
ended World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stuff they used to make the bombs, they got it here and
then someone dropped bombs there, and so many people died,'' said
Rosie Dolphus, one of Deline's widows _ her husband died of bone
cancer a decade ago after years of hauling radioactive ore at a
government-owned mine. ``We want to offer comfort'' to the Japanese
``and explain we had no idea that rock was so dangerous. To others,
to ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   That rock is uranium. And if the Deline Dene played an obscure
role in creating the most fearsome weapon the world has known, they
themselves, it now appears, rank as perhaps the first victims of
the atomic age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our own people are dying, too, because of that rock,'' Dolphus
said.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, beginning in the late 1930s, the Dene were hired as
ore carriers, lugging uranium and radium from the world's first
uranimum mine _ the Eldorado, a Canadian Crown industry located
across the lake in Port Radium _ for shipment to a secret weapons
program in the United States. The mine was closed in 1960, and
abandoned Port Radium has since been renamed Echo Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa has confirmed that uranium from the Eldorado deposit was
used to make the world's first atomic bombs, dropped by US
warplanes on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Saying they are troubled that their labor contributed to so much
agony, the Deline Dene this week sent a delegation of six elders to
Hiroshima to mark the 53rd anniversary of the atomic attack and
express sorrow to the Japanese. It was only in the last few years,
say leaders of the isolated village, that the Dene learned how they
played a small part in one of the defining tragedies of the modern
era. And it disturbed them, especially the elders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to express our sadness and compassion for the
suffering the uranium from Great Bear Lake caused elsewhere,'' said
Cindy Kenny-Gilday, head of the Deline First Nation Uranium
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But the Deline Dene also want to draw international attention to
what they describe as a plague of cancer that has ravaged their
tiny band, most of whose members still subsist by hunting, fishing
and trapping.
</P>
<P>
   Although no official health records were kept until 1989, it
appears that an unusually high percentage of Dene have died of the
disease, starting in the decades after the mine opened.
</P>
<P>
   Other Indians in the Northwest Territories have given Deline the
nickname ``village of widows,'' because so many men have died of
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my grandmother's time, our men regularly lived to be 80 or
90,'' said Gina Bayha, a 35-year-old member of the Deline band
council. ``Now we hardly have any men past the age of 65. Nearly
all died of cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of the men who actually worked in the Eldorado
mine are still alive. Among them is Paul Baton, 83, who recalls
bruising 12-hour shifts loading boats with 100-pound sacks of
uranium ore for shipment across the huge lake and down the
Mackenzie River.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dust coated you like flour, it covered our clothes, our
heads our hands,'' he recounted. ``We would sleep on the sacks. No
one told us anything about it being dangerous. No one told us about
cancer. But over the past 25 years our people have known nothing
but cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dene are convinced that tailings and other waste from the
mining operation have contaminated the water and soil all around
Great Bear Lake. They say the surge of cancers is not limited only
to the men who labored at the Eldorado mine but to every family in
the band.
</P>
<P>
   ````We feel our animals, our fish, our water is all
contaminated,'' Baton said. ``This hurts us, in turn, because we
are consumers of these elements.''
</P>
<P>
   The government does not dispute that the Indians of Deline have
suffered from high cancer rates. But officials, noting the paucity
of records, also say that so far there is no proven medical link
between the deaths and the uranium operation.
</P>
<P>
   Indian Affairs Minister Jane Stewart said Ottawa is
investigating the allegations of continuing radioactive leakage
from the shuttered mine. ``We need to work together... to get clear
a common set of historical facts,'' she told Dene leaders who
appeared before Parliament last month.
</P>
<P>
   About 7,000 tons of radioactive material was shipped from the
Port Radium mine for refinement. But another 1.7 million tons of
uranium waste was either left exposed at the mine site or simply
dumped into Great Bear Lake, according to government documents
uncovered by members of the Dene band who started last year to
investigate the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dene have been expressing concern about the mine tailings
for many years,'' Murray Klippenstein, an Ontario lawyer who has
done volunteer work for the Dene, told the Toronto-based Globe and
Mail newspaper. ``But it has been very hard to get anyone to
listen.''
</P>
<P>
   What most troubles the Dene is that the government, even back in
the 1930s, was aware of the health hazards associated with exposure
to radioactive materials. White miners at the Eldorado mine wore
protective clothing and were required to shower off the uranium
dust after every shift _ precautions not offered to the Indian
carriers, who were known as ``coolies'' and counted as labor so
lowly that the mine didn't even bother keeping Dene personnel
files.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we bring this to the global stage, then perhaps the
Canadian government will be moved to do the honorable thing for the
Deene of Deline,'' said Kenny-Gilday. ``Canada must take
responsibility for the damage done to our people.''

HUN SEN PARTY DECLARED WINNER; COALITION MANEUVERING CONTINUES  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH MYDANS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ The ruling party of Cambodia's leader,
Hun Sen, was officially declared the winner Wednesday in last
week's general election, but maneuvering continued over the shape
of a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the official tally was announced, giving the ruling
party 41.4 percent of the 4.9 million ballots, the electoral
commission was deep into a recount of several districts in response
to complaints from Hun Sen's two chief rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The closest contender was the royalist Funcinpec party of Prince
Norodom Ranariddh, which won 31.7 percent of the vote, according to
the announcement Wednesday by the National Election Committee. In
third place was the party of Sam Rainsy, a critic of the
government, with 14.3 percent of the vote. The remainder was
divided among 36 small parties, none of which won enough votes to
take a place in the 122-seat Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   According to a complicated seat-allocation formula, the
Cambodian People's Party of Hun Sen was expected to secure 64
seats, meaning it will have to enter a coalition with at least one
of its rivals to attain the two-thirds representation needed to
form a government.
</P>
<P>
   Funcinpec was expected to win 43 seats and the Sam Rainsy Party
15 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's announcement confirmed official and unofficial
projections based on partial results.
</P>
<P>
   Already the political focus has moved forward to a bargaining
process that could take several weeks. Parliament is not expected
to convene until Sept. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Hun Sen offered to bring both rival parties into a
coalition, a gesture that some political analysts here said had
been proposed by King Norodom Sihanouk, father of Ranariddh and the
moral leader of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But Hun Sen said his party wanted to keep control of five key
ministries: defense, interior, finance, foreign affairs and
justice.
</P>
<P>
   Ranariddh and Rainsy publicly belittled any talk of a coalition
while their protests of the vote continued.
</P>
<P>
   They are asserting a range of irregularities that include
manipulation during the voting and counting as well as intimidation
of opposition voters before and after election day.
</P>
<P>
   For the last three days the election committee has been
recounting the votes of five small communes that the opposition
asserts were the scene of irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the opposition have demanded more wide-ranging
recounts.
</P>
<P>
   But a Western diplomat said Wednesday that the initial evidence
of the current recounts, and the scope of Hun Sen's victory, made
it unlikely that the review of votes would substantially alter the
outcome of the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing here is political theater,'' the diplomat
said. ``It's part of the bargaining process and it's also par for
the course. You don't lose elections in Cambodia. You either win or
the vote was stolen from you.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Rainsy's influential wife, Samora, who won a Parliamentary
seat in Phnom Penh, said last weekend that if the recount did not
reverse the outcome, the new total could only be the result of
further cheating.
</P>
<P>
   Cambodia's previous coalition government was formed in 1993 when
Hun Sen refused to accept the result of an election won by
Ranariddh.

ARAFAT SHUFFLES CABINET TO ASSUAGE CRITICS, BUT KEEPS KEY MEMBERS
IN PLACE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS JEHL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank _ After staving off pressure for a year,
Yasser Arafat, the chairman of the Palestinian Authority, announced
a cabinet shuffle Wednesday, but he defiantly kept in place
ministers whom lawmakers had wanted dismissed after allegations of
mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   The move did almost nothing to answer the complaints voiced to
Arafat by members of the 88-seat Palestinian Legislative Council,
which has been pressing for a change since last summer. But it
appeared likely to head off the most potent opposition there, in no
small part because Arafat elevated even more lawmakers to parallel
posts on the prestigious Executive Council, or cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat appointed 10 additional ministers to what had been an
18-member council. And he kept almost all of the previous ministers
in their posts, even though a parliamentary report last summer had
portrayed the Palestinian Authority as riddled with mismanagement
and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers, elected in 1996 under the peace accords with Israel,
have become increasingly frustrated at Arafat's reluctance to
accept a draft constitution that would limit the power of the
Authority, which covers most of Gaza and parts of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But they have repeatedly failed to carry out threats to vote
``no confidence'' in him, a fact that reflects the overarching
power that Arafat, who celebrated his 70th birthday on Tuesday,
continues to exert. His critics said that any prospect of a real
check on executive authority had become even less likely after
Wednesday's changes, which one critic, Abdul Jawad Saleh, a cabinet
member, called ``an attempt to buy the Legislative Council.''
</P>
<P>
   The maneuvering came on a day when the prospect of any new
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement seemed once again to have been
set back, this time by the overnight shooting deaths of two Jewish
settlers in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but the Israeli
authorities blamed Palestinians who, they said, had ambushed the
two men, aged 18 and 24, as they were on a security patrol of
Yitzhar settlement. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Israeli
radio that the killings showed the importance of his demand for a
Palestinian crackdown on militants before Israel agrees to hand
over more West Bank land to Palestinian rule.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials condemned the killings but blamed
``provocations'' by Netanyahu's government, including his
resistance to a troop withdrawal plan put forward by the United
States, and the expansion of Israeli settlements on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In Ramallah, the depth of internal frustration with Arafat was
reflected even in comments from some of his ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Hanan Ashrawi, for example, suggested that Arafat should have
done more to respond to parliamentary complaints. ``I believe that
when people called for change, they didn't ask for additions,'' Ms.
Ashrawi, the minister of higher education, said of the new
composition of the Executive Council. ``What we see now is
maintaining what existed, and adding people to it.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of an understanding by which the lawmakers held off a
scheduled no-confidence vote in order to allow Arafat more time to
appoint a new team, he asked for and received letters of
resignation two months ago from all 18 members of the council.
</P>
<P>
   But in making his announcement Wednesday, he said he had
accepted just one resignation, from Education Minister Yasir Amr,
who is elderly and in failing health. Arafat said that he wanted
the 17 others to remain in the cabinet, and that 13 would remain in
their current posts.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are to stay in place include Jamil Tarrife, the
minister of civil affairs, who had been a main target of corruption
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   There is not yet a clear system of checks and balances in
Palestinian law, and no obstacle to a member of the Legislative
Council serving also as a member of the Executive Council. Even
before Wednesday there was a good deal of overlap, but the
expansion plan that Arafat announced will mean at least six more
lawmakers will wear both hats.
</P>
<P>
   Among the lawmakers added to the cabinet were several who are in
their 30s or early 40s, including Hassan Asfour, a highly regarded
peace negotiator, as minister without portfolio, and Hisham Abdel
Razzak as minister of prisoners affairs. That step was singled out
as a positive one by a number of Arafat's lieutenants, who called
it important in the transformation of a Palestinian leadership that
has been dominated by men and women in their 50s and 60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major shift,'' said Saeb Erekat, a member of the
council and a top peace negotiator. ``It's a first look at how the
political life of the Palestinians will look in 5 or 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as Arafat announced his decision, some lawmakers were
unusually bold in announcing their displeasure. Inside the chamber
Saleh, who has served as agriculture minister and had been trying
to resign from the cabinet, shouted out in protest when Arafat
announced that he did not intend to permit him to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Saleh said afterward that he would not join the new cabinet, and
he portrayed the shuffle as unresponsive to the lawmakers'
concerns. ``I think this is a slap in the face to the council,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Legislative Council was formed, lawmakers have tried
in vain to assert greater influence over the unelected branches of
the Palestinian leadership, but Arafat and his Executive Council
have maintained tight control of all the important levers of power.

OMB DIRECTOR DEFENDS SHAKY U.S.-RUSSIAN PARTNERSHIP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration is not yet prepared to
sever Russian ties to the international space station despite
serious warnings from NASA that the Russians are not meeting
commitments to the project, a House panel was told Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Lew, director of the Office of Management and Budget,
defended the shaky U.S.-Russian partnership in space before a
skeptical House Science Committee.
</P>
<P>
   While conceding problems, Lew argued that the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration had benefited from Russian
expertise in space.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Vice President Al Gore spoke to Russian leaders
about the space funding during his July trip there and President
Clinton plans to raise the issue when he visits Russia in
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not share the view that there is no more hope that the
Russians will fulfill their role,'' the administration's chief
budget officer said.
</P>
<P>
   But many committee members of both parties appeared unconvinced
by Lew's arguments, saying that they have little faith that the
Russians will ever keep up their part of the bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers added that delays in space station development caused
by the Russian problems have cost U.S. taxpayers as much as $2
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make the decision to cut and run because we cannot
tolerate any more losses,'' said Rep. Vernon Ehler, R-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   A recent GAO report set the total cost of the space station
project at $96 billion with development and construction to cost
$24.7 billion. While the dollar value of Russia's contribution is
not easily calculated, the components for which they are
responsible are crucial both to the station construction and to the
project's timetable. Russia's contributions include life support
and living modules as well as crew and cargo transport.
</P>
<P>
   The first launch of construction components is set for November.
NASA has warned that the launch of a service module next April is
``in jeopardy'' because of Russia's money problems.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., said that NASA
may have to find an additional $50 million to $100 million by
September to pay the Russians for work on the service module. The
Russian government has not provided funding for their space agency
since last April, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lew told the committee that finding another $100 million to fix
the immediate Russian shortfall would not be problematic. However,
he said the administration had not figured out how to come up with
the $500 million to $1 billion that may be needed if the Russians
were cut out of the project completely.
</P>
<P>
   Lew ruled out using the budget surplus for the space station,
saying the president has dedicated that money to keeping Social
Security viable in the long term.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers complained that space station cost overruns forced
NASA to dip into other space programs, particularly research
funding.
</P>
<P>
   The ranking Democrat on the committee, Rep. George Brown,
D-Calif., said that, while he has long been a supporter of the
space station, he may change his mind if the research funds are
continually raided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might have to quit being Mr. Nice Guy,'' said Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dana Rohrbacher, R-Calif., said that NASA should stop
dealing with the Russian government and instead negotiate with
Russian companies to help finish the project.
</P>
<P>
   Rohrbacher said the partnership is ``fatally flawed'' because
NASA is ``going through a corrupt and incompetent government.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nick Lampson, D-Texas, whose district includes the Johnson
Space Center in far south Houston, said he is not ready to end the
relationship with Russia. Instead, Lampson suggested that members
of Congress build better relations with members of the Russian
Duma, or parliament, to encourage lawmakers there to pay more
attention to the space program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should pull the plug on it,'' he said of the
partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Lampson also agreed with the administration's contention that
space station funding would not affect other NASA programs as much
if Congress gave the space agency more money.
</P>
<P>
   The House has appropriated $13.32 billion for NASA next year,
slightly less than the $13.42 billion requested by the
administration. The Senate, however, has appropriated $13.61
billion for the space agency.

CONGO REBELS STRENGTHEN THEIR HOLD, IDENTIFY LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast _ Rebel forces in Congo consolidated their
hold Wednesday on much of the eastern regions of the country, and
the names of civilian leaders who might be replace the embattled
President Laurent Kabila if the uprising succeeds began to
circulate for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   In the clearest indication so far that the armed insurrection
against Kabila, which began on Sunday, may spread across Congo
(formerly Zaire), a rebel-controlled radio station in Goma
Wednesday identified a Kinshasa politician and native southerner,
Arthur Zaidy Ngoma, as the leader of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The radio reported that Ngoma, who had been jailed by Kabila,
had already joined the rebels in Goma, which Kabila's government
concedes is firmly in rebel hands.
</P>
<P>
   Ngoma, a longtime official of the U.N. Childrens' Fund, had been
living in Paris, where he had gone for medical care and asylum
after he was released from prison in response to strong
international pressure. Ngoma was jailed late last year after his
small Kinshasa-based party, the Forces of the Future, attempted to
convene a political forum in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Until Ngoma's name emerged, the four-day old rebellion had been
almost exclusively identified with dissident troops from the
country's small Tutsi minority from the eastern border with Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila rode to power at the head of a rebellion by these very
same Tutsi forces in May 1997, after a seven-month rebellion that
overthrew the longtime dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko. But as a
guerrilla fighter long isolated in the mountainous east with little
national name recognition and no political base, Kabila was never
able to establish much authority for himself.
</P>
<P>
   If the rebels' choice of Ngoma is confirmed, it may indicate
that the patrons of the rebellion _ by almost all accounts, Rwanda
_ have decided that they cannot afford to have a new national
leader who comes across purely as the puppet of the Banyamulenge,
as the Congolese Tutsi are known.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Rwandan officials Wednesday repeated their
denials of involvement in the Congo revolt, but in doing so seemed
to reaffirm their strategic interest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment there is no reason for Rwanda to be there,''
Rwanda's president, Pasteur Bizimungu, said during an official
visit to Zambia. ``But if we have a serious reason to get involved,
we will.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a senior official said intelligence sources show
considerable Rwandan involvement in the insurgency. ``The Rwandans
are on the march from three corners of the country and they're
getting a lot of sympathy and moving very fast,'' the official
said.)
</P>
<P>
   At the outset of the uprising against Kabila, statements by some
rebel leaders led many experts to say the insurrection was more
concerned with defining a large buffer zone in eastern Congo that
would be at least loosely controlled by Congo's eastern neighbors,
Rwanda and Uganda. Those two nations have long complained about
attacks by guerrillas based in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   But when he formally defected to the rebel side, Kabila's former
foreign minister, Bizima Karaha, made clear that the goal was to
press all the way to Kinshasa, just as Kabila did.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This is a country-wide revolution to topple Kabila,'' Karaha,
a Congolese Tutsi, said in a conversation with Reuters from Goma.
``Towns are falling without resistance because people are
disillusioned and angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats, international aid workers and the government itself
all suggest that heavy fighting continues for control of several
other major cities, including Uvira and the strategically important
Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
   Just as it did in Kabila's campaign against Mobutu, the fighting
for Kisangani will represent a pivotal test: If the rebels can take
the city and hold its airport, Kabila will have almost no means of
moving reinforcements into eastern Congo. By the same token, the
rebels could use Kisangani as a major forward base from which to
attack western Congo and perhaps seize the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Kisangani falls, people will quickly begin counting
Kabila's days,'' said one Western diplomat.

CONTROVERSY REFLARES AS BRADY LAW NEARS EXPANSION TO LONG GUNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The 1994 Brady law restricting handgun sales will
soon expand to include all firearms, a change that could come as a
rude surprise to gun buyers who want a new rifle or shotgun for the
fall hunting season.
</P>
<P>
   Changes scheduled to take effect Nov. 30 will add so-called long
guns _ rifles and shotguns _ to the list of weapons covered by the
law. Purchasers will face the same background check that is
required for handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Other changes will require background checks on gun owners who
reclaim pawned firearms or guns that have been repaired. At the
same time, the current five-day waiting period will be replaced by
an instant check system that critics contend is fraught with
potential problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal's going to be a real mess,'' said Mike Massey, who
owns the Firearms Unlimited gun shop in Fort Worth. ``There's going
to be a bunch of gnashing of teeth and a lot of foul language.
There's going to be a lot of unhappy customers.''
</P>
<P>
   The upcoming changes have revived much of the controversy that
marked the initial law's passage. President Clinton is expected to
join the fray Thursday by endorsing efforts in Congress to retain a
three-day waiting period for handgun sales.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, lawmakers who oppose gun control hope to block the
FBI's plans to charge as much as $16 for background checks on gun
buyers, a fee that retailers would pass on to customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to have a firestorm surrounding that issue,''
said Wayne LaPierre, the National Rifle Association's executive
vice president. ``It's going to be an interesting fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the changes were written into the original Brady law,
but they were widely overlooked in the bigger fight over
restricting handgun sales. The legislation took effect in 1994
after a seven-year battle led by Sarah and James Brady, the former
White House press secretary who was wounded in an assassination
attempt against Ronald Reagan in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   The federal law prohibits handgun sales to felons, drug abusers,
mentally ill people, illegal aliens, spouse abusers and others
deemed unqualified for gun ownership. Justice Department figures
show that the law has stopped about 242,000 sales out of 10.4
million attempted handgun purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association accepted the belated inclusion of
rifles and shotguns in the law as part of a legislative compromise
that permitted the shift from a waiting period to an instant check
system this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is kind of a sleeper,'' Robin Terry, a spokeswoman for
Handgun Control Inc., said of the expansion to rifles and shotguns.
``When I found out about it, I was pretty shocked too.''
</P>
<P>
   If the instant check system works as planned, legitimate buyers
should face minimal inconvenience, regardless of whether they are
buying a handgun or a shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're ready,'' FBI spokesman Paul Bresson said. ``We
don't anticipate at all that there's going to be any problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one outside the FBI seems confident of a smooth
transition.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control advocates worry that the system will not catch
unqualified buyers; gun owners fear the potential effect on
legitimate purchasers. Partisans on both sides of the debate
question whether the FBI is ready to handle millions of requests
for background checks from gun retailers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have instant or you can have a check, but you can't
have both,'' said Tom Diaz of the Violence Policy Center, an
organization that favors gun control laws. ``This system goes on
line right in the middle of the hunting season. If we can lose the
president's plane on the radar screens in the air traffic control
system, which has happened a couple of times, I think we can
anticipate some glitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun retailers in Texas and other states that do not conduct
background checks will provide customer information to the FBI by
computer or through a toll-free telephone line. The FBI estimates
that most checks will take from 30 seconds to 3 minutes. If the
agency does not respond within three days, the sale is
automatically approved.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, most background checks are processed at the
state or local level, and authorities have five days to respond.
</P>
<P>
   Massey, the Fort Worth gun retailer, predicted that the
background checks will send some legitimate buyers to the
secondhand gun market, which is beyond the reach of the Brady law.
</P>
<P>
   ``A normal, average person isn't accustomed to having their
name, their address, their date of birth and other critical
information read to the FBI,'' Massey said. ``There are going to be
a bunch of people who say, `No, I'm not going to do that.'
Customers need to know what's fixin' to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun control advocates say the potential hassles are more than
offset by the benefit of protecting society from people who have no
business owning a gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like with any new system, there will probably be some glitches
in the beginning,'' said Terry, the Handgun Control spokeswoman.
``This is a way to enforce the laws on gun ownership. I don't think
we'd feel any safer if someone owned a long gun instead of a
handgun.''

INDONESIA AND PORTUGAL ANNOUNCE AUTONOMY PLAN FOR EAST TIMOR

 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Indonesia and Portugal announced Wednesday that
they had agreed on the broad outlines of an autonomy plan for the
disputed territory of East Timor that would give the Timorese the
right to local self-government and control of educational and
cultural affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia would retain control of foreign and military affairs
and some monetary and fiscal policies.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement to discuss Indonesian proposals to resolve East
Timor's status is the first major diplomatic break in over two
decades of standoff between Portugal, which abandoned the territory
after its 1974 revolution, and Indonesia, which invaded the
following year. East Timor has never been recognized as part of
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The two nations will also take the first step toward the
resumption of full diplomatic relations with the opening of
``interests sections'' in each other's capitals by the end of the
year. The Netherlands will represent Portugal in Jakarta and
Thailand will be asked to represent Indonesia in Lisbon, the
Portuguese and Indonesian foreign ministers said at a news
conference Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Timorese leaders will take part in the detailed talks on the
future of the territory, a step that Indonesian Foreign Minister
Ali Alatas said would ``open channels'' to Timorese in exile.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not there yet,'' United Nations Secretary General Kofi
Annan said Wednesday at the news conference. ``We are going to be
holding in-depth discussions on these proposals.'' But he added,
``We hope we can iron everything out and have an agreement or
understanding by the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   There is still strong support for independence among exiled East
Timorese and within East Timor, whose population is culturally and
ethnically different from the rest of Indonesia. But many East
Timorese, including exiled leaders, say they would accept a
transitional arrangement and could wait up to five years for a
referendum on the territory's final status. The territory has
benefited materially from Indonesian aid programs, even if they
were intended only to mitigate military rule, and some Timorese may
be swayed by these gains.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Alatas pledged that Indonesia is prepared to grant genuine
autonomy ``that conforms with international norms.'' The Portuguese
interpret that as an acknowledgment by the new Indonesian
government that world opinion must be factored in, even though the
Indonesians still hold that the territory is legally theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed Wednesday to say whether Indonesia was changing its
position on its absolute claim of sovereignty over East Timor,
Alatas said that issue had been set aside for the present. ``When
we reach that point, we will cross that bridge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama said the two countries
had moved from ``principled positions that we keep to a common
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan has been an active mediator in talks between the two
foreign ministers. He was expected to leave Wednesday night for
Lisbon where he was to meet Thursday with the Timorese Roman
Catholic Church leader, Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo, and Jose
Ramos-Horta, the most important exiled Timorese political leader
and an advocate of complete independence. The two men shared the
1996 Nobel Peaxce Prize. But Annan had to postpone the trip for 24
hours because of another weapons crisis with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's special envoy on East Timor, Jamshed Marker of Pakistan,
will be in charge of the talks, which are to be held on several
levels among government officials and other public figures from
Portugal, Indonesia and East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Alatas was asked Wednesday about the fate of another East
Timorese leader, Jose Xanana Gusmao, commander of the armed
guerrilla movement known as Fretilin, who is in jail in Jakarta. He
said Gusmao would not be released under the amnesty for political
prisoners and detainees that was recently ordered by the new
government, but would be freed at some future date.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Xanana Gusmao, unlike those prisoners and detainees whom
we are now releasing, did not only engage in flag-waving or
demonstrations or other actions usually connected with political
actions,'' Alatas said. ``He also _ during the time that he was
leading the forces in East Timor whom we have called
security-disturbance perpetrators _ he has killed, he has burned
villages, he has killed innocent villagers, he has raided the
properties of villagers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is for these criminal acts that he has been brought before
the courts and convicted,'' he said. ``However, we have also said
at the same time that his is a special case. We do foresee, we do
visualize the release of Xanana Gusmao as part and parcel of an
overall solution to the East Timor question.''
</P>
<P>
   Alatas said that Indonesia planned to continue reducing its
forces in East Timor but that there would always be troops there
for defense, as there are in other areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood that Indonesia's army will interfere with a
change in Timor's political status may be receding as cases of past
human rights violations by the military are uncovered in increasing
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   They include reports this week of mass graves in Aceh, a
province at the tip of Sumatra that has been in almost perpetual
rebellion, first against the Dutch colonial administration and then
against succeeding Indonesian governments since independence in
1949. Indonesia rights groups say thousands of bodies may have been
buried in mass graves in Aceh after the army stormed the region in
1990 and 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Such abuses were widely known or suspected during the
three-decade rule of President Suharto, who was ousted by popular
demand in May. Since his resignation, many findings of past abuses
have been published, and a number of officers are being
investigated and prosecuted for more recent human rights
violations.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor, half of an island shared with the undisputed
Indonesian province of West Timor, has about 800,000 people, who
are geographically closer to Australia than to the main Indonesian
island of Java. Many of its indigenous people speak Tetun rather
than Indonesian and most are Roman Catholic, a religion they were
taught by the Portuguese. Indonesia, with 200 million people, is
overwhelmingly Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   Alatas said Wednesday that these ``specific conditions'' would
be taken into account in any autonomy plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only speak of autonomy when you give all the rights to
the population except in three fields: foreign affairs, external
defense and certain monetary and fiscal policies,'' he said. ``We
will discuss in depth what it will take for this autonomy.
Certainly it would include their own governance, except in the
three fields. That means governance in economic affairs, in
political affairs, in education, in cultural policy.''

PARENTS IN BABY SWITCH INVOLVED IN DOMESTIC ABUSE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANARDSVILLE, Va. _ The tragedy of two babies switched at
birth, already compounded by the death of one set of parents, has
another sad twist: domestic abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Court records show that Carlton Conley, who is apparently the
biological father of one of the girls, last year beat Paula
Johnson, the anguished mother who in a press conference this week
told her story to the world.
</P>
<P>
   And next month, Conley, 34, goes on trial on another charge of
assault and battery against Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The files in Virginia's Greene County circuit court show that
Johnson, 30, also had a scrape with the law. In 1994, she was found
guilty of ``curse and abuse,'' a crime in the state, after lunging
at the car of a neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   If the relatives of the two girls _ Callie and Rebecca _ end up
going to court to fight for custody or visitation rights, legal
scholars say, the parents' suitability will be one of the most
important issues. And if the families sue the University of
Virginia Medical Center, where the children were born, defense
lawyers are likely to investigate the parents' backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and her attorney did not return phone calls Wednesday. A
lawyer who represented Conley in last year's assault case said
family court matters are confidential and he could not comment.
</P>
<P>
   But when the estranged pair sat before a bank of 29 television
cameras and more than 60 reporters on Tuesday afternoon, they left
viewers with an image of two loving, devoted parents overcoming
their past problems after realizing they were victims of a baby
switch in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Conley said they were doing their best to work out
an agreement that is best for Callie, the girl they brought home
from the hospital three years ago, as well as Rebecca, the girl who
is, apparently, their biological daughter. The unmarried couple who
had raised Rebecca were killed in a car crash on July 4.
</P>
<P>
   The families first suspected that their babies were switched
after Johnson demanded more child support from Conley and they
submitted to routine DNA tests. The tests showed that Callie was
not the biological child of either Conley or Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter at the press conference asked Conley and Johnson
whether they were back together, Cynthia Johnson, their attorney,
answered. ``They are together in working things out for their
child,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Conley and Johnson, flanking the lawyer, looked straight ahead
and said nothing to contradict her. But the arrest records and
restraining orders tell of a very divided couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carlton Conley chased me all over...,'' reads a criminal
complaint that Paula Johnson filled out by hand on Jan. 28, 1997
with the Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court in
Stanarsville, in the foothills of Virginia's scenic Shenandoah
Mountains. ``He then ran into the back of my car with his truck.
Mr. Conley then grabbed me by my arms, pushed and shoved me into my
car... he then got a gun and shoved me and said he would shoot me
if I didn't stop...''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson asked for and received a protective order keeping Conley
away from her children, including Callie.
</P>
<P>
   Conley was sentenced to 90 days in jail. He appealed, but David
C. Dickey, a lawyer who represented him, withdrew the appeal and
Conley was allowed to serve just four days.
</P>
<P>
   Conley was arrested again on January 17, 1998, for assault and
battery of Johnson. Johnson's request for a restraining order said
``Mr. Conley pulled me by the hair and pushed a bar stool into my
back.'' A hearing is scheduled for Sept. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson herself &UR;  &LR; was arrested on June 10, 1994 for ``curse and
abuse.'' A neighbor, Sharon Knight, said she drove over to pick up
Johnson's son, and waited for five minutes. ``As I was going to
leave, Ms. Johnson came out of the house (and) called me a fat
bitch and started running at the car. I had two other kids with
me...'' the criminal complaint says.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was found guilty and ordered to pay $185.00 for a fine
and court costs.

401K (Undated) - If you thought the negative signs on your last

WEATHER (Tempe, Ariz.) - Americans' work habits are ruining their
weekends. New research by two climatologists at Arizona State

LEIBOWITZ-COLUMN (Undated) - The cop's heart had been still a
minute when the D.C. vultures grabbed his corpse. They emoted for
``Nightline,`` for ``Today,`` forever. The pols keened long and
loud over Detective John Gibson, shot dead defending our Capitol.
It's a Washington dwarf's fondest dream: heroism by association, to
gain honor on the coattails of a giant. Now Arizona's own, Rep. Bob
Stump, R-District 3, has a new twist: To build himself up by
tearing a hero down. Gibson, he says, doesn't belong in Arlington
National Cemetery. His sin? He wore the wrong uniform. Gibson, a

MCI SEEKS EQUAL ACCESS DIALING IN MASSACHUSETTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MCI Corp. wants to offer local toll calls using the same single
digit _ 1(plus) the area code and number _ that Bell Atlantic's
Massachusetts customers use.
</P>
<P>
   So Wednesday, the nation's No. 2 long-distance carrier asked
state regulators to require Bell Atlantic to give all customers in
the state the choice to seek an alternate local phone service
provider, such as MCI or AT&AMP;T, and to implement the same
``1(plus)'' dialing.
</P>
<P>
   Known as equal access dialing, it is available in 23 states,
including New York and all other New England states served by Bell
Atlantic. But in Massachusetts, MCI and AT&AMP;T customers must enter a
seven-digit access code before dialing the area code and number for
local toll calls.
</P>
<P>
   MCI wants the state's Department of Telecommunications and
Energy to require Bell Atlantic to implement 1(plus) dialing no
later than Feb. 8, 1999 _ the date the Federal Communications
Commission expects the 1(plus) service to be available nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, local toll calls, such as between Boston and Lowell,
require MCI's eastern Massachusetts customers to dial
10(plus)10(plus)222(plus)area code and phone number, while Bell
Atlantic customers only dial 1(plus)area code and number. For AT&AMP;T
customers looking to make local toll calls, the access code is
10(plus)10(plus)288 followed by the area code and phone number.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very supportive of MCI's action and rather surprised
that Massachusetts is the last bastion of this kind of Bell
company's monopoly that prevents customers from having that freedom
of choice,'' said Gary Morgenstern, an AT&AMP;T spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the 1996 Telecommunications Act that was designed to
open up the regional Bell companies to local telephone competition,
most of the 23 states, including those in New England, had
implemented equal access dialing.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, Bell Atlantic issued a statement in response to
MCI's appeal to state regulators, saying it also favors permitting
MCI to market 1(plus) dialing for regional toll calls. However,
Bell Atlantic stressed that the state DTE _ not the FCC _ has the
final say on the timing of granting equal access to non-Bell
Atlantic carriers.
</P>
<P>
   By implementing equal access dialing, the DTE will eliminate the
lengthy and inconvenient access codes, thus enabling customers to
automatically route their local toll calls to the phone carrier of
their choice, said an MCI spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're caught in a `Catch-22' situation that rewards Bell
Atlantic for preserving its monopoly control of local phone service
in Massachusetts,'' said Robert Lopardo, regional director for MCI
Public Policy. ``Approval of MCI's petition is the first stop to
granting consumers and businesses the freedom of choice they
deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Both MCI and AT&AMP;T stressed that the proposed equal access code
applies to local toll calls within only the 617, 781, 978, and 508
area codes. Calls to the 413 area code, such as between Boston and
Springfield, are billed as long-distance calls.

4 AFRICANS IN STANDOFF SEEK TO STAY IN FRANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Since last Saturday, four African immigrants demanding
permission to stay in France and five of their supporters have
occupied the residence of the Papal Nuncio in Paris, refusing to
leave until the Socialist government of Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin agrees to give them legal papers.
</P>
<P>
   The same four were among a group of more than 200 illegal
immigrants whom Jospin, then in opposition, visited two years ago
while they were occupying the Roman Catholic Church of St. Bernard
de la Chapelle, vowing to stay until the conservative government of
the time, led by Prime Minister Alain Juppe, gave in to their
demands.
</P>
<P>
   Juppe's government called in the police and threw the immigrants
out of St. Bernard that August. Last year, French voters threw out
Juppe and elected Jospin.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin had promised during his election campaign to change
restrictive immigration laws imposed by conservative governments in
the 1980s. The new government got 150,000 illegal immigrants to
come forward by promising to reconsider their cases and then said
70,000 had not met the criteria for legal immigrants and would have
to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``This government is even worse than the last one,'' said Lindor
Bambagueye, a Senegalese supporter of the group occupying the
nuncio's residence, as he stood with a group of 100 or so
demonstrators on the other side of the Avenue du President Wilson
from the barricaded building. ``We helped them get elected, too,''
he said of Jospin and his government. Bambagueye now describes them
as ``traitors.''

<P>
   France does not find it easy to reconcile the legacies of its
colonial past with its republican ideals of liberty, equality and
fraternity. Persistently high unemployment, down from a peak of
12.5 percent last year but still 11.8 percent, has worsened a
far-right political backlash against millions of Muslim immigrants
who had poured in from former French colonies in North Africa since
the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Militant immigrants, many but not all Muslims, have made
churches a focal point of the movement to put pressure on Interior
Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement. After a hunger strike by
immigrants occupying a Protestant church in the Batignolles
neighborhood in Paris ended in July, he agreed to consider appeals
from the 70,000 rejected immigrants ``in a positive spirit'' and
not to expel any until all appeals had been exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   Church authorities have blown hot and cold, according to some of
the immigrants. The nuncio, Archbishop Mario Tagliaferri, had fed
the occupying immigrants, they said before they stopped answering
calls on their portable telephone Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On instructions from Rome, the nuncio also urged the French
Interior Ministry to take another look at their cases. The Ministry
agreed, but only if the demonstrators left the building and
presented themselves at Paris police headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the Vatican asked the occupiers to leave voluntarily
and respect French law.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll stay in the building until they get papers,''
Bambagueye said. ``The police don't need to study the files on them
again; they know them by heart by now.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Bambagueye, of the 314 people who occupied the
Church of St. Bernard in 1996, only 26 ended up being deported.
</P>
<P>
   One man died; he was one of 10 who had conducted a seven-week
hunger strike. All but 17 got at least temporary residence permits,
and permits for all of them are now the goal of the four
``sans-papiers,'' those without documents now occupying the
Nuncio's residence.
</P>

<P>
   The movement got unexpected support in July from Charles Pasqua,
the conservative politician who, as interior minister in 1986 and
again in 1993, got the immigration laws changed to make it more
difficult for foreigners' children born in France to acquire
citizenship and for relatives from abroad to join those here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have before us a problem that we have to treat with
pragmatism and responsibility,'' Pasqua said in an interview with
the daily Le Monde that caused a political sensation. There is only
one solution, he said. ``We can only get out of this by giving
papers to all those who have come forward and asked for them,
except for criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   That was exactly what some of Jospin's leftist political allies
had been demanding, and some of the prime minister's advisers
suspected Pasqua was just trying to cause trouble for Jospin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some segments of French public opinion, particularly
intellectuals, who say we should accept everybody who presents
himself for immigration,'' Jospin said recently. But, he added,
that had never been his position.

EX-PROSECUTOR HAD DOUBTS ABOUT MAFIA INDUCTION SITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The former federal prosecutor who got the court order
which led to the first-ever recording of a Mafia induction ceremony
testified Wednesday that she doubted the secret meeting would
actually happen in a suburban neighborhood on a Sunday morning _
despite mounting evidence gathered by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Diane M. Kottmyer said neither the information of mob informant
Angelo ``Sonny'' Mercurio, which detailed the time and place of the
ceremony, nor prison furlough records which showed that inmate
Vincent Federico, the guest of honor, was headed to the same
location in Medford that day was enough to convince her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found it hard to accept that there was going to be an
induction ceremony in a house on an everyday street in Medford at a
location that a proposed inductee had specified on a furlough
application,'' said Kottmyer, the former head of the New England
Organized Crime Strike Force and now a Massachusetts Superior Court
judge.
</P>
<P>
   Even if she had believed the information Mercurio told the
bureau two days before the Oct. 29, 1989 ceremony, Kottmyer said,
she could not have disclosed it to the judge who authorized the
``roving bug'' because the FBI had ordered her not to.
</P>
<P>
   To include specific details about the induction _ known by just
a few Mafiosi _ could expose Mercurio's role as an informant and
endanger his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that was their decision, then I was precluded by law from
putting that information in a document that could be disclosed,''
Kottmyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Kottmyer's handling of the request for a roving bug _ which
targets conversations of named individuals without specifying
locations where they might be intercepted _ is at the core of
proceedings in federal court aimed at suppressing the fabled
induction-ceremony recordings from criminal trials involving two
generations of mobsters.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers argue that the more-intrusive roving
surveillance should not have been sought if investigators knew the
specific location where mobsters' conversations could be overheard.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of limiting the bugging to a certain site, the court
order allowed the FBI to bug any conversations of alleged Mafia
consigliere Joseph Russo and alleged capo regimes Vincent Ferrara
and Robert Carrozza during a 30-day period.
</P>
<P>
   But the day the court order was sought Mercurio told the FBI
that the induction ceremony would be held the following Sunday
morning at a home in Medford.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  And Federico's furlough application, which the FBI obtained
that same day, said he would be visiting his sister and
brother-in-law at the Guild Street address that Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that information, Kottmyer said she was skeptical;
Mercurio's cohorts might be feeding him inaccurate information to
ferret him out as an informant. And she doubted that Federico would
``advertise'' the time and location of a secret ceremony on a
prison document.
</P>
<P>
   Even after FBI agents saw Mercurio and two fellow mobsters
checking out the Medford address the Friday afternoon before the
ceremony and watched as Federico's relatives left for the weekend,
Kottmyer still was doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was concerned that it was a setup,'' Kottmyer testified. She
feared that if agents broke into the presumably-empty house to
install microphones, ``(Federico's sister) would be sitting in the
kitchen, the Medford police would be called and the FBI agents
would be arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   Kottmyer also was mindful of the fact that the ceremony would be
held in a borrowed home _ a strong argument for a roving bug, which
is designed to capture conversations of organized crime figures who
move from place to place to thwart surveillance.

ECONOMIC SCENE: LOTTERIES CAN BE CHANCIER THAN PEOPLE THINK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PETER PASSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the latest American success story: Save your pennies,
invest in an organization that donates a third of its income to
good works and walk away with a big nest egg, say $161 million.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Powerball _ and the state lotteries with more modest
seven-figure prizes _ aren't what Horatio Alger had in mind. But
for the vast majority of people, lotteries are merely a harmless
pastime that diverts funds from illegal gambling. ``The original
idea was to replace the numbers racket and raise some revenue
painlessly,'' says Charles Clotfelter, an economist at Duke
University.
</P>
<P>
   As the states work ever harder to persuade people to play,
though, this reasoning is growing weaker. ``Once you make it
legal,'' argued Peter Reuter, an economist at the University of
Maryland's School of Public Policy, ``you inevitably lose control
of the promotion.''
</P>
<P>
   For economists, locked in utilitarian reasoning, gambling is
hard to explain among people who spend tens of billions of dollars
to reduce personal risk. Why, for example, would someone shell out
hundreds of dollars every month for medical insurance to eliminate
the small risk of having to pay $20,000 in hospital bills _ and
then turn around and trade the sure thing of a dollar in hand for
one chance in 50,000 of winning $20,000?
</P>
<P>
   And why do lottery players seem to be attracted to the games
with the highest payoffs? So-called progressive games, in which
uncollected jackpots are carried forward, might explain this
phenomenon: As the prize accumulates, the expected return to each
dollar wagered does rise, in some cases actually exceeding the
amount bet.
</P>
<P>
   But psychological research suggests a simpler explanation.
People, it seems, just aren't up to the challenge of comparing tiny
probabilities of unlikely things happening. So they may assess the
chances of winning a $100 million jackpot as roughly the same as
winning a $10 million jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, noted Robert Frank, an economist at Cornell University,
there's a sense that a few million dollars no longer counts as much
because it no longer symbolizes true, drop-dead wealth. ``Great
fortunes are far more visible today than a few decades ago,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how the frenzy is explained, there's no doubt that
business is booming. Last year, according to La Fleur's World
Lottery Almanac (www.lafleurs.com), Americans paid $34 billion for
lottery tickets _ up from $16 billion in 1988. Of the $34 billion,
prizes absorbed 54.5 percent, and selling costs 5.8 percent. That
left $11.5 billion for state-financed causes like education or aid
to the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   While states almost always earmark lottery proceeds for the
needy at the outset, Reuter notes that the revenues do not seem to
change government spending priorities in the long run: One way or
another, an extra $100 million from the lottery for schools means
roughly $100 million less for education from general revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery proceeds, like taxes on cigarettes, are widely perceived
as ``good'' taxes because they are voluntary. No one, after all, is
forced to buy lottery tickets. But while no one can deny the
popularity of this back door to revenue, economists are generally
appalled by the states' increasing dependence on lotteries. ``This
is a large, terribly regressive tax on a service sold by a state
monopoly,'' Reuter argued.
</P>
<P>
   What would he do about it? A modest step would be to eliminate
advertising aimed at expanding the market. Massachusetts, where
lottery spending (at 1.7 percent of personal income) is twice the
national average, has been shamed into gestures in this direction.
</P>
<P>
   A much bolder step would be to slash the effective tax rate by
increasing the percentage paid in prizes. If one state did it,
others might be forced to follow. On the other hand, why would a
state kill the goose that is laying those billion-dollar eggs?
</P>
<P>
   Robert Frank of Cornell argues that the state monopoly itself is
a mistake because it links government to the socially destructive
impulse to try to get rich quick. ``I think states should be out of
the business entirely,'' he said, perhaps by licensing and taxing
private lotteries.
</P>
<P>
   There is some hope that advertising for the lottery will
subside, if only because the market is saturated. But even
economists aren't naive enough to believe that the states will
abandon a vastly profitable _ and popular _ monopoly in the name of
civic virtue.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, great things are sometimes done with lottery proceeds.
``They built the Sydney opera house, perhaps the most interesting
building in the country, with lottery money,'' recalled Reuter, who
is Australian born. ``Of course, it cost many times the amount
originally budgeted,'' he said, ``and that meant the hospitals did
without lottery proceeds for a few extra years.''

MOSTLY MOZART FESTIVAL: STRETCHING AND SHRINKING TO MEET MUSIC'S
NEEDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, from
London, has been a presence in the record bins for more than a
decade, its recordings often offering surprisingly fresh views of
works that had been plentifully covered by other period-instrument
groups, as well as pieces for which early string and wind timbres
were a new twist.
</P>
<P>
   Like most ensembles of its kind, it draws on a large pool of
freelancers, most of them young enough to have grown up during the
early-music movement's current period of commercial and artistic
assertiveness. And in keeping with the period-instrument world's
unspoken doctrine of elasticity, it expands to romantic orchestral
proportions and shrinks to baroque chamber orchestra size as the
repertory demands.
</P>
<P>
   For its belated American debut, as part of the Mostly Mozart
Festival, the orchestra showed some of its flexibility: Having
already shown its strengths in classical proportions in a Mozart
and Chopin concert, it scaled back to baroque proportions for works
of Boyce, Vivaldi, Bach and Handel on Tuesday evening at Alice
Tully Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the first concert, which was conducted from the podium,
this one was played almost as chamber music, with Margaret
Faultless, the concertmistress (or leader, as the British prefer),
and Neal Peres da Costa, the harpsichordist, providing subtle cues.
Now and then, the orchestra's strings had a strident edge, or minor
intonation problems. But the salient features of the group's
performance were the solidity and precision of its ensemble
playing, and the sense of joy with which the musicians brought the
music to life.
</P>
<P>
   Thoughtful interpretive touches were plentiful as well. In the
unusually fleet and focused reading of Bach's ``Brandenburg''
Concerto No. 3, a brief but elegantly elaborated cadenza by da
Costa connected the two Allegro movements.
</P>
<P>
   More often than one would expect in these style-conscious times,
ensembles play the cadential chords either unadorned or with only
the sparsest embellishment. The pointed staccato phrasing of the
opening Andante Larghetto of Handel's Concerto Grosso in A (Op. 6,
No. 11), and the bright coloration of the fast movements in William
Boyce's Overture No. 5 were also particularly enlivening.
</P>
<P>
   Emma Kirkby, the soprano, sang several Handel works, beginning
with a cantata, ``Armida Abbandonata,'' and returning later for
``Sweet Bird,'' an aria from ``L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il
Moderato,'' and, as an encore, an aria from ``Alcina.''
</P>
<P>
   As a Handel interpreter, Ms. Kirkby has grown extraordinarily: A
decade ago, her singing was so uninflected, and so focused on
purity of tone, that her critics wondered whether she had read the
texts she was singing. In ``Armida Abbandonata,'' though, she drew
freely on the voice's expressive arsenal to convey the drama and
emotional depth in the music.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Sweet Bird,'' on the second half of the program, Ms. Kirkby
and Lisa Beznosiuk, the flutist, traded bird calls with an
appealing virtuosity. Ms. Beznosiuk had a slight edge, having taken
the opportunity to practice her chirps and trills earlier, in a
lovely, warm-toned account of Vivaldi's ``Il Gardellino'' Concerto.

MALLS TREND FINE LINE WITH TEENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By GLEN CRENO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Sometimes, Ramon Rosales thinks the security guards
are a little too interested in him and his friends when they show
up at the mall.
</P>
<P>
   Rosales, 18, figures it's got to be the clothes _ baggy jeans,
T-shirts _ that attract attention.
</P>
<P>
   Funny thing, though. Everything he's wearing he bought at the
mall, and he says he'd probably buy more if people didn't follow
him around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just leave,'' Rosales said. ``I'm out to have fun, not hang
out with security guards.''
</P>
<P>
   Young shoppers like Rosales are important to malls. Teenagers
make up 10 percent of the U.S. population, nearly 27 million people
who have money to spend and none of the worries of older shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have a mortgage to pay. They don't have a car
payment to pay. Their money is their own. If they see a $65 pair of
jeans, they're more apt to buy them,'' said Sheila Hunter,
marketing director at Fiesta Mall in Mesa, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   But malls also must balance their need to keep young shoppers
happy against legitimate security concerns. They don't want
teenagers gathering in big crowds, getting noisy and scaring away
other customers.
</P>
<P>
   It's a dance of demographics that keeps malls on their toes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't, obviously, go after teenagers and say, `You look
like a punk, so you're going to get out of here.' '' said Daniel
Jones, assistant gneral manager at Arizona Mills in Tempe, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the kids love to wear the baggy pants, and they may
not be the clean-cut, blond-haired, blue-eyed image of what
everybody thinks they should look like.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're behaving themselves, they're perfectly welcome to
be here. But if they step out of line, we deal with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Teenage Research Unlimited, a Northbrook, Ill., market research
firm, did a study last year estimating that shoppers ages 12 to 19
spent nearly $109 billion in 1995, with teen girls shelling out an
average of $63 a week and teen boys $68. Malls court that spending
power by offering stores like Wet Seal, Virgin Megastore, Rampage,
Miller's Outpost and dozens of others that target young shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't want them to come, we wouldn't lease to those
stores,'' said Nancy Fikes, marketing director at Chris-Town Mall
in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Young people are important to malls not only as customers but
also as workers in the stores and food courts.
</P>
<P>
   And teens are attractive to malls for still another reason:
They're the people who will make up the young families that stores
will covet in the next three, five or 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teenagers are the future adult shoppers of our malls,'' said a
research report issued last year by the International Council of
Shopping Centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mall is very important to teenagers,'' ICSC spokeswoman
Karen Killeen said. ``Many teens work in the mall, and they spend
their money in the mall. They're spending their own money and also
are influential on their parents and what they buy for them, as
well as their younger brothers and sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   Malls always have had to deal with teenagers acting up. But the
emergence of street gangs in the early part of this decade took
those concerns to a new level.
</P>
<P>
   Some malls inserted specific language in their codes of conduct
to prevent people from wearing clothing that identified them with
gangs. Security was tightened.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix-area mall managers say gangs have toned it down. They
can't be sure how many gang members pass through their doors, but
they say far fewer people are dressing in gang colors obvious
enough for security to ask them to cover up or leave the property.
</P>
<P>
   ``The displaying of colors used to be very important,'' said Tom
Gage, general manager of Metrocenter in Phoenix. ``They would wear
red bandanas or blue bandanas or Oakland Raiders jackets to
associate them with XYZ gang. You don't see that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Big groups of youngsters still can cause problems, though.
</P>
<P>
   Malls are a natural place for teenagers to meet friends, see a
movie or just pass some time talking. They feel they're entitled to
do so since malls have become the de facto town square in suburban
communities short on places for people to gather and spend time
together.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Archuleta, assistant manager of the Barnes &AMP; Noble
bookstore in Ahwatukee, Ariz., said crowds of kids can jam
sidewalks and store aisles.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not looking at anything,'' he said. ``There are big
groups of just 10, 15 kids, just standing there.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble likes its customers to spend time in its stores.
It invites them to browse or sit and read in plush chairs, and
Archuleta said about half the teenagers who come into his store are
well-behaved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like to be against kids,'' Archuleta said. ``Some of
them come in and use the coffee shop. They do buy books here.''
</P>
<P>
   Mall of America, the giant shopping center near Minneapolis,
came up with an escort rule when teenagers began to turn the mall
into their weekend hangout. Teens 16 and under must be with an
adult 21 or older after 6 p.m. on Friday and Saturday nights.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Amy Griffin said there were too many unsupervised
teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just increases the potential for something to happen,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Teenagers seem to carry a truckload of stigmas. They're
sometimes assumed to be potential shoplifters, but, in fact,
merchants say there's no typical profile for people who steal.
</P>
<P>
   Those stereotypes are frustrating. Hunter said Fiesta Mall
executives found that out when they ran two focus groups of
teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   Young people often feel they're being discriminated against,
Hunter said, because of they way they look and act. And the
teenagers said they deliberately dress to shock, but not as a form
of rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Hunter said the teenagers were trying to jolt adults
into recognizing that they are unique and shouldn't be judged on
what they wear but rather who they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really are not as shallow as we might think they are,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosales said that making assumptions about teenagers based on
appearance isn't just foolish. It can be expensive, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may not like the way I dress,'' he said. ``They judge me.
But they lose out on my business.'' &QL;

PARENTS IN BABY SWITCH INVOLVED IN DOMESTIC ABUSE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANARDSVILLE, Va. _ The tragedy of two babies switched at
birth, already compounded by the death of one set of parents, has
another sad twist: domestic abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Court records show that Carlton Conley, who is apparently the
biological father of one of the girls, last year beat Paula
Johnson, the anguished mother who in a press conference this week
told her story to the world.
</P>
<P>
   And next month, Conley, 34, goes on trial on another charge of
assault and battery against Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The files in Virginia's Greene County circuit court show that
Johnson, 30, also had a scrape with the law. In 1994, she was found
guilty of ``curse and abuse,'' a crime in the state, after lunging
at the car of a neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   If the relatives of the two girls _ Callie and Rebecca _ end up
going to court to fight for custody or visitation rights, legal
scholars say, the parents' suitability will be one of the most
important issues. And if the families sue the University of
Virginia Medical Center, where the children were born, defense
lawyers are likely to investigate the parents' backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and her attorney did not return phone calls Wednesday. A
lawyer who represented Conley in last year's assault case said
family court matters are confidential and he could not comment.
</P>
<P>
   But when the estranged pair sat before a bank of 29 television
cameras and more than 60 reporters on Tuesday afternoon, they left
viewers with an image of two loving, devoted parents overcoming
their past problems after realizing they were victims of a baby
switch in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Conley said they were doing their best to work out
an agreement that is best for Callie, the girl they brought home
from the hospital three years ago, as well as Rebecca, the girl who
is, apparently, their biological daughter. The unmarried couple who
had raised Rebecca were killed in a car crash on July 4.
</P>
<P>
   The families first suspected that their babies were switched
after Johnson demanded more child support from Conley and they
submitted to routine DNA tests. The tests showed that Callie was
not the biological child of either Conley or Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter at the press conference asked Conley and Johnson
whether they were back together, Cynthia Johnson, their attorney,
answered. ``They are together in working things out for their
child,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Conley and Johnson, flanking the lawyer, looked straight ahead
and said nothing to contradict her. But the arrest records and
restraining orders tell of a very divided couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carlton Conley chased me all over...,'' reads a criminal
complaint that Paula Johnson filled out by hand on Jan. 28, 1997
with the Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court in
Stanarsville, in the foothills of Virginia's scenic Shenandoah
Mountains. ``He then ran into the back of my car with his truck.
Mr. Conley then grabbed me by my arms, pushed and shoved me into my
car... he then got a gun and shoved me and said he would shoot me
if I didn't stop...''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson asked for and received a protective order keeping Conley
away from her children, including Callie.
</P>
<P>
   Conley was sentenced to 90 days in jail. He appealed, but David
C. Dickey, a lawyer who represented him, withdrew the appeal and
Conley was allowed to serve just four days.
</P>
<P>
   Conley was arrested again on January 17, 1998, for assault and
battery of Johnson. Johnson's request for a restraining order said
``Mr. Conley pulled me by the hair and pushed a bar stool into my
back.'' A hearing is scheduled for Sept. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson herself &UR;  &LR; was arrested on June 10, 1994 for ``curse and
abuse.'' A neighbor, Sharon Knight, said she drove over to pick up
Johnson's son, and waited for five minutes. ``As I was going to
leave, Ms. Johnson came out of the house (and) called me a fat
bitch and started running at the car. I had two other kids with
me...'' the criminal complaint says.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was found guilty and ordered to pay $185.00 for a fine
and court costs.

HOUSE REJECTS PLAN TO USE STATISTICAL SAMPLING IN 2000 CENSUS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican-controlled House rejected a proposal
Wednesday to use statistical sampling in the 2000 census as members
split mostly along party lines in a fight over the best way to
measure the nation's population.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal to fund the controversial sampling method, offered
as an amendment to the 1999 Justice, Commerce and State departments
spending bill, was defeated 227-201 after a heated two-hour debate.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of each decade, a population count is taken to
determine how federal aid is distributed and which political
districts get redrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans oppose the sampling method, which uses estimates to
account for people that are not reached by traditional counting
methods, on the ground that it could be manipulated to help
Democrats in redistricting fights.
</P>
<P>
   They contended that the only way to ensure an accurate census is
to individually count the number of people living in each U.S.
household.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats argued that the traditional door-to-door counts
and mailing of questionnaires resulted in an undercount of more
than 8 million in 1990, causing the loss of billions of dollars to
some states and communities with concentrations of poor minorities
and rural residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just about politics. It is about the economic
future of the cities, towns and villages of this country,'' said
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The census is today's great civil rights issue, and once again
the Republicans are standing against what is right and what will
give us an accurate count,'' Gephardt added.
</P>
<P>
   In arguing against the sampling technique, the Republicans
seized on a statement in June by President Clinton comparing the
methods used to estimate population counts with political polls. In
his remarks then, Clinton acknowledged that polling data can
sometimes be off by a few percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for inaccuracies, said House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., is why Republicans are opposed to sampling. ``The
American people,'' he said, ``deserve to be counted as a real
individuals'' and not ``estimated'' as ``virtual persons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Please don't ask the people of the United States to rely on
politicians controlling pollsters to invent virtual people to get a
grossly inaccurate count on behalf of a political party,'' he
implored his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   The larger $34 billion spending bill contains nearly $1 billion
in 1999 funding for the Census Bureau. But it also contains a
mechanism that withholds half of the money until Congress and
Clinton agree on how to conduct the 2000 population count.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats labeled the Republican-engineered funding plan ``a
political scheme'' designed to force the bureau to abandon
statistical sampling and to ensure that minorities and poor people
are undercounted because they do not normally support Republican
candidates and causes.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau raised the idea of sampling _ or extrapolating
data from a random survey of U.S. households _ more than a year ago
because of a contention that it would guarantee more accurate
population numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton embraced the idea of sampling in June, declaring in a
speech in Houston that it would help the Census Bureau achieve a
more accurate head count of minorities, immigrants, children and
poor people who may not respond to census questionnaires or who may
get overlooked by official government counters.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued by the White House after Wednesday's vote,
Clinton accused Republicans of ``undermining the Census Bureau's
ability to plan and conduct an accurate decennial census.''
Although Clinton did not say he would veto the larger spending bill
unless it provides funding for sampling, Commerce Secretary William
Daley, who oversees the Census Bureau, said he would recommend such
action.
</P>
<P>
   Daley said the House's decision to only fund the bureau until
March of next year would prevent government officials from
completing critical preparations for the 2000 census, including the
creation of address lists, the hiring of census personnel, and
completing arrangements for data processing and printing of
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the certainty of full funding, the bureau cannot move
forward with these operations and the prospects of Census 2000 are
greatly undermined,'' Daley said. &QL;

 &HT;    Premiere, MasterCard sign a pact
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Premiere Technologies has taken a big step toward
refurbishing the company's image, signing a potentially lucrative
five-year deal to provide telecommunications services that will be
offered to MasterCard holders.
</P>
<P>
   Premiere will be the exclusive vendor internationally for
MasterCard and the ``preferred'' provider in the United States for
features like voice mail, e-mail by phone and conference calling.
For the company, whose stock was hammered in June after the company
warned of a revenue shortfall, the news provides investors with
reason for renewed confidence.
</P>
<P>
   MasterCard, which has 23,000 member institutions that have
issued 340 million cards, will market the services jointly with
Atlanta-based Premiere. Company officials declined to disclose
financial terms of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff John, research associate at Robinson-Humphrey Co., said the
deal will likely produce little revenue for some time. A similar
arrangement Premiere crafted a year ago with American Express is
not yet having a substantial impact, he said. ``I think it is
mostly important because of the fact that Premiere has added a blue
chip customer to its base.''
</P>
<P>
   This spring, Premiere stock crashed from about $32 a share to
below $11. Since then, Premiere has named a new president and given
greater visibility to Chief Financial Officer Harvey Wagner, who
has been more aggressive in briefing analysts about company
operations. On Tuesday the company reported earnings of $5.3
million, or 11 cents a share, on revenue of $121.4 million. Results
were in line with projections the company made in its June warning,
evidence Premiere is on the road to predictability, if not to quick
growth in profits.
</P>
<P>
   Premiere still faces several class-action lawsuits, including
one filed this week. Plaintiffs accuse Premiere of buying companies
faster than their operations could be combined with Premiere.
Several Premiere insiders are also accused of having taken
advantage of what they knew by selling much of their stock before
the bad financial news hit.

 &HT;    What, me worry? Average investor takes market in stride
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The Dow Jones stocks are off 7 percent in the last
two weeks, while some broader market indexes are down even more.
But there seems to be little erosion in the hang-tough attitude of
ordinary metro-area investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm concerned, but I'm not worried. I've been
investing now for 16 to 18 years in various stocks, bonds and
mutual funds,'' said Fredrick B. Wilcox, 76, a retired Shell Oil
engineer from Conyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sort of thing has happened before in that period of
time.'' he said. ``My investments are long-term, and I do not
speculate.''
</P>
<P>
   Some investors actually welcome what's happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a correction. I'm hoping that it's a correction,
a long overdue correction. We've been lucky with the double digit
returns every year. Everything that goes up needs to come down
eventually. This market has been on an upswing for a long time, and
we mustn't be too greedy,'' said Edie K. Friedman, 49, a
pre-kindergarten teacher from Dunwoody.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a recession, her outlook is sunny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that as long as the economy is good and we have low
inflation, the market will keep on an even keel or go up. But if
there's a huge increase in inflation and people start losing their
jobs and the economy goes kaput, then it may be a different
story.''
</P>
<P>
   She did offer some sombre thoughts and a warning to novices
about market risk. ``If we see these enormous 400-point drops every
day for more than three weeks at a time, I'll start to worry,'' she
said. ``But I doubt it (will happen).
</P>
<P>
   ``People who invest for a long period of time know that (stocks
are) a good investment, but it's a form of gambling, and you
shouldn't have money in it that you can't afford to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   What's different about the current decline versus those of the
last few years is there's less talk this time about treating the
market downturn as a buying opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors are even considering the possibility of taking
profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband and I just talked today about some stock options we
have, whether now is a good time to exercise them to buy a minivan
for our growing family,'' said Karen Morrow, 37, an Atlanta
housewife.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were talking about how every time the market drops it's not
necessarily a bad thing. It can be a good time to buy. But this
time we've been reading reports by those who say the market could
drop another 20 percent before year-end. So we'll just have to wait
and see.''

 &HT;    HoneyBaked purchases Hickory Ham
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- HoneyBaked Ham Co. of Georgia will reduce its
reliance on seasonal business with the acquisition of Atlanta-based
competitor Hickory Hams. Terms were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   HoneyBaked Ham, a specialty retailer that generates nearly 70
percent of its revenue during the six-week holiday stretch between
Thanksgiving and New Year's, was attracted to Hickory Ham's deli
and dining concept, as well as its franchise expertise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to open up our focus,'' said Linda van Rees,
chief executive of HoneyBaked Ham, the originator of the
spiral-sliced gourmet ham. ``Hickory Hams is an interesting
derivative of our original concept.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately held HoneyBaked had revenue of $102 million in 1997.
Hickory is expected to add about $10 million revenue to HoneyBaked
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition gives HoneyBaked Ham new geographic reach.
Hickory Hams, which has its corporate office and distribution
center on Pleasantdale Road, operates 50 stores, including 22 in
metro Atlanta. The remaining stores are in small southeastern
markets. HoneyBaked Hams, with 100 stores in 15 states, focuses on
bigger cities and will enter 10 new markets with the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw opportunities to open 1,000 stores nationally, but it
would've taken substantial capital and resources that I didn't
have,'' said Hickory Hams President Charles Rooks. He expects the
franchisees to double or triple store sales with the HoneyBaked
identity. Hickory Hams stores will continue to operate under the
same name for the near future.
</P>
<P>
   HoneyBaked, which has its corporate office on Dresden Drive and
a catalog facility in Carrollton, has no immediate plans to close
any Hickory Ham operations and has offered positions to its 30
corporate employees.

 &HT;    Oki Telecom lays off most local workers
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Friday is the last day for what remains of Oki
Telecom, Inc.'s American cellular phone operation.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese company, slowly scuttled by market struggles, laid
off most of what was left of what once was a 750-employee workforce
at the Suwanee factory in June. The 40-person sales and marketing
staff leaves Friday. A shadow staff of engineers will stay in
Suwanee to deal with standards issues, but future Oki Telecom
cellular phones will be made in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Workers received a severance package of between six months and
one year worth of pay, said Sheryl Savage, a marketing specialist
with Oki Telecom, a subsidiary of Japan's Oki Electric Industry.
Most of the recently laid off workers had at least seven years of
experience with the company, and some had as much as 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 200 workers making ignitions for cars and motorcycles
will stay on at the Old Peachtree Road plant at least through
year's end. The company expects to move into a smaller Gwinnett
County facility early next year, Savage said.
</P>
<P>
   Oki Telecom traces its trouble in the booming cellular phone
industry to an inability to get its digital phones to market
quickly enough to be competitive, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1997, 136 workers were laid off. One year earlier, Oki
Telecom cut 100 people from a 550-person workforce.
</P>
<P>
   The first cellular telephone call was made on an Oki Telecom
phone in 1983, during a staged event at Chicago's Soldier Field.
Oki Telecom started in 1984 with three employees in Norcross,
growing to a peak of more than 700, with an annual payroll of $22
million. The company moved to Suwanee in 1989.

UMASS ADOPTS SINGLE LOGO FOR ALL FIVE CAMPUSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The University of Massachusetts is uniting its five
campuses under a sleek new logo, in another step of a marketing
campaign designed to raise the profile and the esteem of the
system.
</P>
<P>
   The new logo, a script ``U'' against a blocky ``M,'' was
designed for use on the Amherst campus. But UMass President William
M. Bulger liked it so much he appropriated it for the whole system.
The trustees chose it over another logo Wednesday after a year-long
design campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is thrilled that it would go systemwide,'' said Kay
Scanlan, director of the news office at the Amherst campus, the
flagship of the state university system. ``To have the president so
excited about it is a feather in everyone's cap.''
</P>
<P>
   The university, which has been running television ads with
alumni such as Bill Cosby and Rick Pitino to try to raise its
stature, hopes the logo will make the name even more widely
recognized. Until now, the system has used different logos on
different campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of making the university more cohesive,'' said
John Hoey, a UMass spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But the university's most popular marketing item _ the jerseys
for its championship basketball team _ will not sport the logo.
Each campus will also have its own color for the logo, and maintain
its own logo and mascots for its athletic teams.
</P>
<P>
   The university had begun a campaign to design the logo last
year, and had selected two finalists from 40 submissions. The logo
rejected Wednesday had the ``M'' alongside the ``U.''
</P>
<P>
   In choosing the one they did, the trustees hoped to make
another, subtler point: Putting the M behind the U, the university
said, emphasizes that Massachusetts _ that is, its taxpayers and
its Legislature, which gives it its money _ is behind the
university.

CHRYSLER UNVEILS DETAILS ABOUT ITS PLANS WITH MERCEDES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Ala.)   (bl)  
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. _ Chrysler Corp. plans to begin building
Mercedes sport utility vehicles at an Austrian factory, and may buy
a type of side air bag from Mercedes, Chrysler's president said
Wednesday. The announcement provided some of the first details of
possible savings from Chrysler's planned merger this autumn with
Daimler Benz AG.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company, DaimlerChrysler AG, will also have
ordinary shares that will be traded in New York, Germany and
elsewhere with equal ease, said Chrysler president Thomas
Stallkamp. Executives considered and rejected the more common
approach of allowing trading in the United States of American
depository receipts, which represent claims on shares quoted on
foreign stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler intended to file a proxy statement Thursday or Friday
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and its executives
have avoided discussing the planned merger before then for legal
reasons. But Stallkamp spoke with a dozen reporters at the
University of Michigan's annual auto industry conference here in
northwest Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   While investors in New York and Frankfurt, Germany, have mostly
welcomed the planned merger, some auto industry executives have
privately questioned whether the gains possible in a combination of
a German luxury-car maker and an American manufacturer mainly of
Jeeps and minivans. Mergers in other industries, notably banking,
have been based on the elimination of overlapping jobs and
operations, but Daimler and Chrysler have very different products
and have insisted that no job reductions were planned.
</P>
<P>
   Stallkamp said Wednesday that Chrysler planned to add a third
shift as soon as possible at a factory complex in Graz, Austria, to
produce Mercedes sport utility vehicles there. Chrysler already
builds 50,000 Jeep Grand Cherokees a year and 50,000 Voyager
minivans a year at the factory, which is actually owned by Magna
International, a Canadian company which is also Chrysler's largest
supplier of auto parts.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercedes factory in Tuscaloosa, Ala., has been unable even
to keep up with demand in the United States, which has crimped the
automaker's plans to export the sport utility vehicle to Europe and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Stallkamp said that Chrysler was also considering the purchase
of so-called air curtains from Mercedes for installation in
Chrysler's cars. These are a type of side air bag that drops during
a crash to cover the inside of a car's front and rear side windows.
</P>
<P>
   The air curtains protect a car occupant's head and neck during a
side impact, and are increasingly popular with the spread of sport
utility vehicles and pickup trucks that have hoods at the same
height as the heads of seated car occupants.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. have already offered a
few side air bags and plan to make them much more common over the
next couple of years, but Chrysler has been slower to develop the
technology and does not offer them.

 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Latin America's tourism sector has put out the welcome mat, and
both foreign visitors and foreign investors are flooding in.
 &HT;    Up-to-date region-wide statistics are hard to come by. But
countries like Brazil, Argentina and Chile are enjoying healthy
increases in the number of foreign tourists. After problems with
local guerrilla movements and bad weather, the tourism sectors in
Mexico and Peru are starting to turn the corner. And now that peace
has come to Central America, countries like Costa Rica, Guatemala
and Nicaragua are beginning to bring in more foreign visitors
looking for a bargain vacation spot.
 &HT;    ``Latin America has been virgin territory for so long,'' says
Scott Berman, director of hospitality consulting services at
U.S.-based consulting firm Coopers &AMP; Lybrand. ``But it's really
starting to pick up.''
 &HT;    Why? The infrastructure that supports tourism _ air access,
hotels, ground transportation, multilingual tour operators and the
like _ has improved considerably in many countries across the
region, particularly in Argentina and Chile. But Brazil and Peru
are beginning to make inroads as well, as are many of the Central
American countries.
 &HT;    The trend has caught the attention of regional and foreign hotel
operators. More than US$750 million has been invested in Latin
America over the last five years by some two dozen hotel chains,
according to a new survey by U.S.-based consulting firm KPMG Peat
Marwick.
 &HT;    Mexico-based Grupo Posadas, for example, operates a four-star
Fiesta Inn in Belize City and has already bought some land to put
up a new five-star Fiesta Americana in Caracas. But the group's big
news came in early May, when the company acquired the Caesar Park
brand name for Latin America for $123 million. The sale included
three existing hotels, two in Brazil (Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paolo)
and one in Argentina (Buenos Aires). The purchase made Posadas the
largest hotel company in Latin America with 51 hotels in five
countries.
 &HT;    Recent foreign investment includes plans by Choice Atlantica
Hotels, a franchise of U.S.-based Choice Hotels International, to
build and operate 100 hotels in Latin America in partnership with a
fund managed by Darby Overseas Investments, a venture capital firm
headed by former U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady.
 &HT;    All in all, the top ten hotel chains in Latin America boosted
their room capacity by an average of 17 percent between 1991 and
last year, according to KPMG.
 &HT;    ``Latin America's outstanding economic performace [last year]
combined with recent market reforms, has created conditions for
sustained increases in hotel investment,'' Clay Dickinson, senior
manager of KPMG's real estate and hospitality practice, said when
releasing the firm's survey.
 &HT;    Domestic tourism also seems to be improving, especially in
countries like Brazil and Mexico. With many economies across the
region on the mend, joblessness declining and real incomes rising,
residents are more willing _ and able _ to splurge on a vacation.
It has also helped that air fares among the local carriers are
coming down, especially in countries like Brazil.
 &HT;    Inter-regional tourism is up, too, with Argentines going to
Uruguay and Brazilians visiting Argentina and Chileans venturing
all the way to Mexico. With agreements like Mercosur increasing
trade between countries, it's a lot easier for residents to jump
borders. It's also a lot cheaper to travel a few countries over
rather than all the way to the United States or Europe.
 &HT;    Berman thinks this trend has created a huge opportunity for
international developers that cater to mid-market tourists, rather
than the upper echelon. ``Regional tourism is really embryonic and
often overlooked,'' Berman says. ``But it shouldn't be ignored.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    BRAZIL
 &HT;    Brazil's tourism authorities have set a goal to put the country
firmly on the international tourism map by the end of this decade.
 &HT;    As part of a five-year program that started in 1996, the
government is deregulating the air travel market and investing
massively in the tourism industry.
 &HT;    Embratur, Brazil's tourism agency, and the Inter-American
Development Bank are spending $1.2 billion to improve roads,
airports and sanitation in three of Brazil's tourism regions: the
Northeast, the Amazon and the Pantanal.
 &HT;    The private sector is responding positively to the government's
action. About $5 billion in private projects has been allocated to
build new hotels and thematic parks before the year 2000. Early
this year, Terra Encantada, Brazil's answer to Disneyworld, opened
its doors in Rio de Janeiro following a $300 million investment by
Brazilian investors.
 &HT;    Foreign tourists are now starting to arrive. After dipping to
one million in 1990, the number of foreign visitors to Brazil
peaked at 2.6 million in 1996. Official figures for 1997 haven't
been released yet, but tourism officials estimate that more than
three million foreign visitors came to Brazil last year.
 &HT;    Domestic tourism is also up. While Embratur has no official
figures, Brazilian airport agency Infraero reports that the number
of Brazilian passengers peaked last year at 22 million, versus 13
million in 1993. Tourism officials are expecting 20 percent more
this year because of a television campaign they are launching to
encourage Brazilians to get to know their own country.
 &HT;    Deregulation of the air travel market has helped. Earlier this
year, the Brazilian Department of Commercial Aviation allowed
airlines to cut domestic ticket prices by up to 65 percent over the
full fare, which is set by the government. As a result, a price war
has ensued among Brazilian airlines. Varig, Brazil's largest
airline, is offering a 60 percent discount to the northeast region.
For example, a one-way ticket from Rio de Janeiro to Recife plunged
from $380 to $172. The one-way fare from Rio to Salvador also went
down, from $291 to $131. Airlines VASP, TAM and Transbrasil have
followed suit, cutting fares on select flights, including Rio de
Janeiro-Sao Paulo.
 &HT;    Brazil's hotels have also jumped on the bandwagon. Some 300
members of the Brazilian Association of Hotels are discounting room
rates by 30 percent to 50 percent during the low season, which
occurs betwen August and November. The same goes for rental car
companies, which are offering 20 percent to 50 percent discounts.
 &HT;    Francisco Amaro Ripardo, for one, is enthused about the
discounts. A 38-year-old doorman in Rio, Amaro finally saved enough
money to take his daughter to visit relatives in the northwest. But
he couldn't afford to fly, so he took the bus, which cost him $400.
``Now, with these cheap air tickets, who knows,'' he says. ``I can
see them again soon and take the whole family. And by air.''
 &HT;    But there are still some problems ahead. The deregulation of
laws allowing foreign cruise ships to explore Brazil's coast is
still under debate, while the high cost of international air fares
is viewed as one of the main obstacles to Brazil's tourism
industry.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MEXICO
 &HT;    After a rough year in 1997 caused by cold weather and Hurricane
Pauline, Mexico's huge tourism industry is making a modest
comeback.
 &HT;    In the first quarter, passenger traffic at Mexico's airports
jumped nearly 10 percent, with the number of flights increasing 3.7
percent. Hotel occupancy rates rose nearly 10 percent year-on-year
during Holy Week, the week before Easter. The Tourism Secretariat
(Sectur) predicts the number of tourist arrivals to grow by a
healthy 6 percent this year.
 &HT;    Tourism is clearly one of the pillars of Mexico's long-term
development strategy. Revenue from more than 20 million foreign
tourists _ mainly Americans and Canadians, but also including
sizable numbers of Europeans, Latin Americans and Japanese _
reached almost $7.7 billion last year, up 11.5 percent over 1996.
Analysts reckon that if domestic tourism is included, the size of
the industry is at least twice that.
 &HT;    The sector is now Mexico's third-biggest source of foreign
exchange after the maquiladora assembly-for-export industry and
oil. It also accounts for 5 percent of Mexico's gross domestic
product and 1.7 million jobs, or about 6 percent of the work force.
 &HT;    In the long term, however, Mexico's tourism industry faces
several challenges. For one thing, its presence is barely felt
outside of the famous beach resorts and a few colonial towns. To
begin rectifying that, Sectur is currently cooperating with Central
American countries to promote the ``Mundo Maya,'' which includes
the beaches and ruins of the Yucatan peninsula as well as the
colonial city of Merida.
 &HT;    Eco-tourism is also bringing new money to out-of-the-way places.
Forty-eight companies now offer eco-tourism packages, compared with
eight companies in 1994.
 &HT;    Golf resorts are still springing up around the country, and the
Los Cabos resort in Baja California Sur has become a center of golf
and sport fishing. Both the U.S.-based Ritz-Carlton and the
Canada-based Four Seasons are looking to build hotels there.
 &HT;    One possible new attraction, casino gambling, is still in limbo.
The Mexican Congress is scheduled to decide its fate in its next
session, which begins in September. The Mexican Association of
Hotels and Motels is expected to present congressmen with a study
in favor of casinos. Tourism Secretary Oscar Espinosa Villarreal
has not yet indicated the government's stance.
 &HT;    Another challenge is to coax more Europeans and Latin Americans
to the country. Brazilians have become a mainstay in Cancun thanks
in part to the strength of their currency, while travel agencies in
Chile report a certain Mexico fad among travelers.
 &HT;    The big problem is crime, which has spooked tourists from all
over the world. Governments in the United States, Europe, Japan and
other countries have issued strongly-worded warnings about the
dangers of Mexico City, especially the street taxis. With no end in
sight to the current crime wave, things could get worse.
 &HT;    While there's no visible effect yet, crime could have a negative
effect on Mexico's tourism business. A recent study by Sectur's
Center for Tourism Studies revealed the number-one complaint among
foreign tourists was the lack of public security.
 &HT;    Still, Espinosa Villarreal recently said that there are plans to
build tourism developments worth nearly $2 billion, although he did
not say how close these plans were to fruition.
 &HT;    Of the foreign hoteliers, U.S.-based Hilton has been among the
most aggressive. After leaving Mexico in the 1960s, it recently
opened a hotel inside the international terminal at the Mexico City
airport. It's building another in Ciudad Juurez that should be
completed in November and another in Monterrey that should be
finished early next year.
 &HT;    New York investment bank Goldman Sachs, through its emerging
markets real estate fund, is also optimistic about the country's
prospects. It has picked up stakes in Los Cabos resort Las
Palmillas, Mexico City's Four Seasons and Mexican luxury chain
Grupo Quinta Real.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, the government is selling several tourism properties
it took over after the peso devaluation. The crown jewel is Hoteles
Camino Real, the chain of 15 luxury hotels that was seized by the
government from an investor group led by fugitive banker Carlos
Cabal Peniche. Potential buyers are unknown, but at least some
foreign participation is expected.
 &HT;    Creditors have also given the green light to debt-laden tourism
giant Situr to begin selling off some of its 29 hotels.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    PERU
 &HT;    The breath-taking Inca ruins of Machu Picchu are both a blessing
and a curse for Peru's still fledgling tourist industry.
 &HT;    Being so universally famous, they require little advertising to
draw crowds. Yet they blind the visitor to Peru's other, less
spectacular attractions. As numbers of tourists rise, the
transportation headache involved in getting them to the remote
mountain-top site, perched above a deep canyon with no road access,
makes visiting Machu Picchu a more exhausting and less
inspirational trip every year.
 &HT;    Fortunately, initiatives to free up the Machu Picchu bottleneck
are belatedly under way. Privatizations of transport infrastructure
are proceeding. Four consortia are expected to bid for construction
of a cable car to whisk train travelers from the valley track to
the heights of Machu Picchu in speed and comfort. State railway
company Enafer, which runs the improved but still inadequate
tourist train from the city of Cuzco to the ruins, is itself up for
transfer this year to a private sector operator.
 &HT;    All the hotels belonging to Peru's former state chain Enturperu
have also been sold _ or occasionally granted in concession _ to
private sector operators, bringing some welcome upgrading and
improved service. Hotel Valle Sagrado de los Inkas in Cuzco, for
example, was acquired by British investors and is being managed by
Swiss and Americans.
 &HT;    Indeed, foreign hotel operators seem to have discovered Peru's
potential. Lima's best hotel, the Oro Verde, has just been
purchased by Swisshotels, a division of Swiss airline Swissair.
Hilton and other chains like Marriott (USA) and Inter-Continental
(UK) are building five-star hotels in Lima with local partners,
while Holiday Inn (USA) has bought a hotel in Lima and one in
Cuzco.
 &HT;    Although conditions for the tourism sector appears to be
improving, hoteliers and tour operators still complain vociferously
that the government is neither doing the job of promoting or
planning a modern tourism industry for Peru nor is it providing
sufficient encouragement to private businessmen to do the job.
 &HT;    ``The industry is in chaos,'' says Eduardo Arrarte, president
and founder of Lima Tours, Peru's premier tourist agency. ``There
are far too many organizations and no communication between them.
Despite hundreds of expensive studies of the sector, there's not
one person in Peru I'd call an expert on tourism.''
 &HT;    According to trade, industry and housing minister Gustavo
Caillaux, under whose super-ministry tourism falls, the
government's objective is to double the contribution Peru's tourism
industry makes every five years to its overall economy. That means
growth of around 15 percent a year.
 &HT;    Government officials used to target how many numbers of visitors
visited Peru. But in the past, they've proved to be overly
optimistic. Last year, official figures show foreign arrivals
amounted to 700,000, up 10 percent over 1996 but 50,000 short of
the government's goal. ``Real'' tourists account for more than
one-third of that figure; the remainder are businessmen or
foreign-based Peruvians returning home.
 &HT;    The government is now trying to bump up how much these visitors
spend. It has some work to do. Last year, average spending was
$1,684 per tourist (not including the air fare) and the average
stay was 13 nights, according to Caillaux.
 &HT;    Perhaps to convince skeptical private sector businessmen of its
genuine interest in tourism, Promperu, the country's image
promotion agency, recently came up with a ``Profile of the Foreign
Tourist 1998,'' which it ceremonially presented to the national
tourism chamber Canatur in late January.
 &HT;    Conducted in the fourth quarter of 1997, the profile is based on
1,750 interviews with foreign visitors and tour operators. Filled
with modern industry-speak, it calls for the ``conversion of Peru
into a competitive tourist product'' with a ``focused marketing
strategy'' and ``integral promotion with identity.''
 &HT;    Although Promperu's survey showed 68 percent of all tourists
were ``very satisfied'' and 29 percent ``satisfied'' with their
visits, criticisms of transport and infrastructure were abundant.
 &HT;    Particularly troublesome is the situation of domestic flights.
As a result of a fierce price-cutting war, only two airlines are
currently operating domestically, down from eight a couple of years
ago.
 &HT;    However, groups of private investors _ Peruvians in association
with foreign partners _ are now looking at investing in two new
domestic airlines. That should help boost local tourism.
 &HT;    In the meantime, Peru expects more foreigners. Last April,
American Airlines inaugurated its new, direct Miami-Cuzco service,
which should relieve some of the current pressure on seats.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    CENTRAL AMERICA
 &HT;    With peace coming to the region, many Central American countries
are pulling out all the stops to bring in more foreign currency by
attracting more tourists to their ruins, beaches and ecological
sites.
 &HT;    Take Guatemala, for instance. After 36 years of civil war, the
country signed a peace agreement with the guerrillas at the end of
1996. While the U.S. State Department still cautions Americans
about security, Guatemala managed to attract an estimated 10
percent more foreign visitors last year than in 1996.
 &HT;    The government has reallocated funds that used to go to the
military to improving the country's infrastructure. It has built
roads from Los Encuentros to the popular market town of
Chichicastenango and is working to improve the overland link from
Rio Dulce to Flores, where some of the most spectacular Maya sites
are located. The government has also renovated its National
Archeology Museum, which is renowned for its collection of Maya and
other indigenous artifacts.
 &HT;    Foreign companies have appeared on the scene. Several new hotels
have been built, including an Inter-Continental (UK) in Guatemala
City and a few more at Tikal in the Peten.
 &HT;    But Guatemala is having to compete with neighboring Costa Rica,
which is the longest running democracy in Latin America. Instead of
spending taxpayers' money on a military, it has a history of
funnelling resources into its tourism sector. As a result, the
country brings in 800,000 foreign visitors and $700 million in
tourism earnings every year, more than even coffee and banana
production.
 &HT;    While street crime has risen somewhat in San Jose, foreign
visitors _ and investors _ continue to arrive. Several large and
small resorts have opened along the Pacific Coast of the Guanacaste
province. The largest is the luxurious, 900-acre Melia Playa
Conchal Beach &AMP; Golf Resort, which cost $70 million to build.

says Dickinson, whose KPMG survey shows hotel chains planning to
invest an additional $2 billion to $3 billion in the region over
the next five years. ``We've just seen the tip of the iceberg.''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Latin America's tourism sector has put out the welcome mat, and
both foreign visitors and foreign investors are flooding in.
 &HT;    Up-to-date region-wide statistics are hard to come by. But
countries like Brazil, Argentina and Chile are enjoying healthy
increases in the number of foreign tourists. After problems with
local guerrilla movements and bad weather, the tourism sectors in
Mexico and Peru are starting to turn the corner. And now that peace
has come to Central America, countries like Costa Rica, Guatemala
and Nicaragua are beginning to bring in more foreign visitors
looking for a bargain vacation spot.
 &HT;    ``Latin America has been virgin territory for so long,'' says
Scott Berman, director of hospitality consulting services at
U.S.-based consulting firm Coopers &AMP; Lybrand. ``But it's really
starting to pick up.''
 &HT;    Why? The infrastructure that supports tourism _ air access,
hotels, ground transportation, multilingual tour operators and the
like _ has improved considerably in many countries across the
region, particularly in Argentina and Chile. But Brazil and Peru
are beginning to make inroads as well, as are many of the Central
American countries.
 &HT;    The trend has caught the attention of regional and foreign hotel
operators. More than US$750 million has been invested in Latin
America over the last five years by some two dozen hotel chains,
according to a new survey by U.S.-based consulting firm KPMG Peat
Marwick.
 &HT;    Mexico-based Grupo Posadas, for example, operates a four-star
Fiesta Inn in Belize City and has already bought some land to put
up a new five-star Fiesta Americana in Caracas. But the group's big
news came in early May, when the company acquired the Caesar Park
brand name for Latin America for $123 million. The sale included
three existing hotels, two in Brazil (Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paolo)
and one in Argentina (Buenos Aires). The purchase made Posadas the
largest hotel company in Latin America with 51 hotels in five
countries.
 &HT;    Recent foreign investment includes plans by Choice Atlantica
Hotels, a franchise of U.S.-based Choice Hotels International, to
build and operate 100 hotels in Latin America in partnership with a
fund managed by Darby Overseas Investments, a venture capital firm
headed by former U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady.
 &HT;    All in all, the top ten hotel chains in Latin America boosted
their room capacity by an average of 17 percent between 1991 and
last year, according to KPMG.
 &HT;    ``Latin America's outstanding economic performace [last year]
combined with recent market reforms, has created conditions for
sustained increases in hotel investment,'' Clay Dickinson, senior
manager of KPMG's real estate and hospitality practice, said when
releasing the firm's survey.
 &HT;    Domestic tourism also seems to be improving, especially in
countries like Brazil and Mexico. With many economies across the
region on the mend, joblessness declining and real incomes rising,
residents are more willing _ and able _ to splurge on a vacation.
It has also helped that air fares among the local carriers are
coming down, especially in countries like Brazil.
 &HT;    Inter-regional tourism is up, too, with Argentines going to
Uruguay and Brazilians visiting Argentina and Chileans venturing
all the way to Mexico. With agreements like Mercosur increasing
trade between countries, it's a lot easier for residents to jump
borders. It's also a lot cheaper to travel a few countries over
rather than all the way to the United States or Europe.
 &HT;    Berman thinks this trend has created a huge opportunity for
international developers that cater to mid-market tourists, rather
than the upper echelon. ``Regional tourism is really embryonic and
often overlooked,'' Berman says. ``But it shouldn't be ignored.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    BRAZIL
 &HT;    Brazil's tourism authorities have set a goal to put the country
firmly on the international tourism map by the end of this decade.
 &HT;    As part of a five-year program that started in 1996, the
government is deregulating the air travel market and investing
massively in the tourism industry.
 &HT;    Embratur, Brazil's tourism agency, and the Inter-American
Development Bank are spending $1.2 billion to improve roads,
airports and sanitation in three of Brazil's tourism regions: the
Northeast, the Amazon and the Pantanal.
 &HT;    The private sector is responding positively to the government's
action. About $5 billion in private projects has been allocated to
build new hotels and thematic parks before the year 2000. Early
this year, Terra Encantada, Brazil's answer to Disneyworld, opened
its doors in Rio de Janeiro following a $300 million investment by
Brazilian investors.
 &HT;    Foreign tourists are now starting to arrive. After dipping to
one million in 1990, the number of foreign visitors to Brazil
peaked at 2.6 million in 1996. Official figures for 1997 haven't
been released yet, but tourism officials estimate that more than
three million foreign visitors came to Brazil last year.
 &HT;    Domestic tourism is also up. While Embratur has no official
figures, Brazilian airport agency Infraero reports that the number
of Brazilian passengers peaked last year at 22 million, versus 13
million in 1993. Tourism officials are expecting 20 percent more
this year because of a television campaign they are launching to
encourage Brazilians to get to know their own country.
 &HT;    Deregulation of the air travel market has helped. Earlier this
year, the Brazilian Department of Commercial Aviation allowed
airlines to cut domestic ticket prices by up to 65 percent over the
full fare, which is set by the government. As a result, a price war
has ensued among Brazilian airlines. Varig, Brazil's largest
airline, is offering a 60 percent discount to the northeast region.
For example, a one-way ticket from Rio de Janeiro to Recife plunged
from $380 to $172. The one-way fare from Rio to Salvador also went
down, from $291 to $131. Airlines VASP, TAM and Transbrasil have
followed suit, cutting fares on select flights, including Rio de
Janeiro-Sao Paulo.
 &HT;    Brazil's hotels have also jumped on the bandwagon. Some 300
members of the Brazilian Association of Hotels are discounting room
rates by 30 percent to 50 percent during the low season, which
occurs betwen August and November. The same goes for rental car
companies, which are offering 20 percent to 50 percent discounts.
 &HT;    Francisco Amaro Ripardo, for one, is enthused about the
discounts. A 38-year-old doorman in Rio, Amaro finally saved enough
money to take his daughter to visit relatives in the northwest. But
he couldn't afford to fly, so he took the bus, which cost him $400.
``Now, with these cheap air tickets, who knows,'' he says. ``I can
see them again soon and take the whole family. And by air.''
 &HT;    But there are still some problems ahead. The deregulation of
laws allowing foreign cruise ships to explore Brazil's coast is
still under debate, while the high cost of international air fares
is viewed as one of the main obstacles to Brazil's tourism
industry.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MEXICO
 &HT;    After a rough year in 1997 caused by cold weather and Hurricane
Pauline, Mexico's huge tourism industry is making a modest
comeback.
 &HT;    In the first quarter, passenger traffic at Mexico's airports
jumped nearly 10 percent, with the number of flights increasing 3.7
percent. Hotel occupancy rates rose nearly 10 percent year-on-year
during Holy Week, the week before Easter. The Tourism Secretariat
(Sectur) predicts the number of tourist arrivals to grow by a
healthy 6 percent this year.
 &HT;    Tourism is clearly one of the pillars of Mexico's long-term
development strategy. Revenue from more than 20 million foreign
tourists _ mainly Americans and Canadians, but also including
sizable numbers of Europeans, Latin Americans and Japanese _
reached almost $7.7 billion last year, up 11.5 percent over 1996.
Analysts reckon that if domestic tourism is included, the size of
the industry is at least twice that.
 &HT;    The sector is now Mexico's third-biggest source of foreign
exchange after the maquiladora assembly-for-export industry and
oil. It also accounts for 5 percent of Mexico's gross domestic
product and 1.7 million jobs, or about 6 percent of the work force.
 &HT;    In the long term, however, Mexico's tourism industry faces
several challenges. For one thing, its presence is barely felt
outside of the famous beach resorts and a few colonial towns. To
begin rectifying that, Sectur is currently cooperating with Central
American countries to promote the ``Mundo Maya,'' which includes
the beaches and ruins of the Yucatan peninsula as well as the
colonial city of Merida.
 &HT;    Eco-tourism is also bringing new money to out-of-the-way places.
Forty-eight companies now offer eco-tourism packages, compared with
eight companies in 1994.
 &HT;    Golf resorts are still springing up around the country, and the
Los Cabos resort in Baja California Sur has become a center of golf
and sport fishing. Both the U.S.-based Ritz-Carlton and the
Canada-based Four Seasons are looking to build hotels there.
 &HT;    One possible new attraction, casino gambling, is still in limbo.
The Mexican Congress is scheduled to decide its fate in its next
session, which begins in September. The Mexican Association of
Hotels and Motels is expected to present congressmen with a study
in favor of casinos. Tourism Secretary Oscar Espinosa Villarreal
has not yet indicated the government's stance.
 &HT;    Another challenge is to coax more Europeans and Latin Americans
to the country. Brazilians have become a mainstay in Cancun thanks
in part to the strength of their currency, while travel agencies in
Chile report a certain Mexico fad among travelers.
 &HT;    The big problem is crime, which has spooked tourists from all
over the world. Governments in the United States, Europe, Japan and
other countries have issued strongly-worded warnings about the
dangers of Mexico City, especially the street taxis. With no end in
sight to the current crime wave, things could get worse.
 &HT;    While there's no visible effect yet, crime could have a negative
effect on Mexico's tourism business. A recent study by Sectur's
Center for Tourism Studies revealed the number-one complaint among
foreign tourists was the lack of public security.
 &HT;    Still, Espinosa Villarreal recently said that there are plans to
build tourism developments worth nearly $2 billion, although he did
not say how close these plans were to fruition.
 &HT;    Of the foreign hoteliers, U.S.-based Hilton has been among the
most aggressive. After leaving Mexico in the 1960s, it recently
opened a hotel inside the international terminal at the Mexico City
airport. It's building another in Ciudad Juurez that should be
completed in November and another in Monterrey that should be
finished early next year.
 &HT;    New York investment bank Goldman Sachs, through its emerging
markets real estate fund, is also optimistic about the country's
prospects. It has picked up stakes in Los Cabos resort Las
Palmillas, Mexico City's Four Seasons and Mexican luxury chain
Grupo Quinta Real.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, the government is selling several tourism properties
it took over after the peso devaluation. The crown jewel is Hoteles
Camino Real, the chain of 15 luxury hotels that was seized by the
government from an investor group led by fugitive banker Carlos
Cabal Peniche. Potential buyers are unknown, but at least some
foreign participation is expected.
 &HT;    Creditors have also given the green light to debt-laden tourism
giant Situr to begin selling off some of its 29 hotels.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    PERU
 &HT;    The breath-taking Inca ruins of Machu Picchu are both a blessing
and a curse for Peru's still fledgling tourist industry.
 &HT;    Being so universally famous, they require little advertising to
draw crowds. Yet they blind the visitor to Peru's other, less
spectacular attractions. As numbers of tourists rise, the
transportation headache involved in getting them to the remote
mountain-top site, perched above a deep canyon with no road access,
makes visiting Machu Picchu a more exhausting and less
inspirational trip every year.
 &HT;    Fortunately, initiatives to free up the Machu Picchu bottleneck
are belatedly under way. Privatizations of transport infrastructure
are proceeding. Four consortia are expected to bid for construction
of a cable car to whisk train travelers from the valley track to
the heights of Machu Picchu in speed and comfort. State railway
company Enafer, which runs the improved but still inadequate
tourist train from the city of Cuzco to the ruins, is itself up for
transfer this year to a private sector operator.
 &HT;    All the hotels belonging to Peru's former state chain Enturperu
have also been sold _ or occasionally granted in concession _ to
private sector operators, bringing some welcome upgrading and
improved service. Hotel Valle Sagrado de los Inkas in Cuzco, for
example, was acquired by British investors and is being managed by
Swiss and Americans.
 &HT;    Indeed, foreign hotel operators seem to have discovered Peru's
potential. Lima's best hotel, the Oro Verde, has just been
purchased by Swisshotels, a division of Swiss airline Swissair.
Hilton and other chains like Marriott (USA) and Inter-Continental
(UK) are building five-star hotels in Lima with local partners,
while Holiday Inn (USA) has bought a hotel in Lima and one in
Cuzco.
 &HT;    Although conditions for the tourism sector appears to be
improving, hoteliers and tour operators still complain vociferously
that the government is neither doing the job of promoting or
planning a modern tourism industry for Peru nor is it providing
sufficient encouragement to private businessmen to do the job.
 &HT;    ``The industry is in chaos,'' says Eduardo Arrarte, president
and founder of Lima Tours, Peru's premier tourist agency. ``There
are far too many organizations and no communication between them.
Despite hundreds of expensive studies of the sector, there's not
one person in Peru I'd call an expert on tourism.''
 &HT;    According to trade, industry and housing minister Gustavo
Caillaux, under whose super-ministry tourism falls, the
government's objective is to double the contribution Peru's tourism
industry makes every five years to its overall economy. That means
growth of around 15 percent a year.
 &HT;    Government officials used to target how many numbers of visitors
visited Peru. But in the past, they've proved to be overly
optimistic. Last year, official figures show foreign arrivals
amounted to 700,000, up 10 percent over 1996 but 50,000 short of
the government's goal. ``Real'' tourists account for more than
one-third of that figure; the remainder are businessmen or
foreign-based Peruvians returning home.
 &HT;    The government is now trying to bump up how much these visitors
spend. It has some work to do. Last year, average spending was
$1,684 per tourist (not including the air fare) and the average
stay was 13 nights, according to Caillaux.
 &HT;    Perhaps to convince skeptical private sector businessmen of its
genuine interest in tourism, Promperu, the country's image
promotion agency, recently came up with a ``Profile of the Foreign
Tourist 1998,'' which it ceremonially presented to the national
tourism chamber Canatur in late January.
 &HT;    Conducted in the fourth quarter of 1997, the profile is based on
1,750 interviews with foreign visitors and tour operators. Filled
with modern industry-speak, it calls for the ``conversion of Peru
into a competitive tourist product'' with a ``focused marketing
strategy'' and ``integral promotion with identity.''
 &HT;    Although Promperu's survey showed 68 percent of all tourists
were ``very satisfied'' and 29 percent ``satisfied'' with their
visits, criticisms of transport and infrastructure were abundant.
 &HT;    Particularly troublesome is the situation of domestic flights.
As a result of a fierce price-cutting war, only two airlines are
currently operating domestically, down from eight a couple of years
ago.
 &HT;    However, groups of private investors _ Peruvians in association
with foreign partners _ are now looking at investing in two new
domestic airlines. That should help boost local tourism.
 &HT;    In the meantime, Peru expects more foreigners. Last April,
American Airlines inaugurated its new, direct Miami-Cuzco service,
which should relieve some of the current pressure on seats.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    CENTRAL AMERICA
 &HT;    With peace coming to the region, many Central American countries
are pulling out all the stops to bring in more foreign currency by
attracting more tourists to their ruins, beaches and ecological
sites.
 &HT;    Take Guatemala, for instance. After 36 years of civil war, the
country signed a peace agreement with the guerrillas at the end of
1996. While the U.S. State Department still cautions Americans
about security, Guatemala managed to attract an estimated 10
percent more foreign visitors last year than in 1996.
 &HT;    The government has reallocated funds that used to go to the
military to improving the country's infrastructure. It has built
roads from Los Encuentros to the popular market town of
Chichicastenango and is working to improve the overland link from
Rio Dulce to Flores, where some of the most spectacular Maya sites
are located. The government has also renovated its National
Archeology Museum, which is renowned for its collection of Maya and
other indigenous artifacts.
 &HT;    Foreign companies have appeared on the scene. Several new hotels
have been built, including an Inter-Continental (UK) in Guatemala
City and a few more at Tikal in the Peten.
 &HT;    But Guatemala is having to compete with neighboring Costa Rica,
which is the longest running democracy in Latin America. Instead of
spending taxpayers' money on a military, it has a history of
funnelling resources into its tourism sector. As a result, the
country brings in 800,000 foreign visitors and $700 million in
tourism earnings every year, more than even coffee and banana
production.
 &HT;    While street crime has risen somewhat in San Jose, foreign
visitors _ and investors _ continue to arrive. Several large and
small resorts have opened along the Pacific Coast of the Guanacaste
province. The largest is the luxurious, 900-acre Melia Playa
Conchal Beach &AMP; Golf Resort, which cost $70 million to build.
 &HT;    Costa Rica's tourism industry is expected to get a lift from
Continental Airlines, which was scheduled to offer daily nonstop
service from Newark to San Jose in July just in time for the summer
rush.'' Costa Rica [is] one of the hot new areas,'' says Berman.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    OUTLOOK
 &HT;    With Latin America projected to continue showing healthy
economic growth, liberalized aviation conditions and further
investments by hotel operators, the region's tourism sector is
forecast to continue growing significantly. ``You're going to see
more investment capital flow and the construction of more hotels,''
says Dickinson, whose KPMG survey shows hotel chains planning to
invest an additional $2 billion to $3 billion in the region over
the next five years. ``We've just seen the tip of the iceberg.''

 &HT;    AFC Enterprises chairman defends affirmative action
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Frank J. Belatti doesn't see diversity as just the
right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the chairman of Atlanta-based AFC Enterprises said
Wednesday, it's the only thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is no affirmative action, there is no action,'' said
Belatti, a speaker at the first National Multicultural Foodservice
and Hospitality Alliance Conference at the Hyatt Regency in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 students, entrepreneurs, hospitality, restaurant and
food service executives are attending the conference, which ends
today.
</P>
<P>
   Belatti said 48 percent of his company's franchises are owned by
women and minorities, including Churchs Chicken, Popeyes Chicken &AMP;
Biscuits and Chesapeake Bakery. He said it makes good business
sense to hire and promote women and minorities, and to support
minority suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Changing demographics is forcing the issue. By 2010, minorities,
including African-American, Asians and Hispanics, will be half the
U.S. population.
</P>
<P>
   The conference is particularly significant because, combined,
restaurants, food service companies and hotels and motels employ
more than 9.5 million people, one of the largest segments of the
U.S. work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't be playing pattycake,'' said NFHA President Gerald A.
Fernandez. ``We have to be proactive.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the importance of diversity is hitting some
companies a little late, he said. ``What really got people to the
table was human resources,'' he said. ``You can't open a restaurant
if you can't find bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, Hernandez said minorities often overlook careers in
those industries.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is the perception the jobs are low-wage and
low-skilled, he said. That doesn't take into accounts jobs such as
hotel and restaurant management or chef positions _ some of which
can command six-figure salaries.

   DEBONAIR-CAT-BURGLAR (Los Angeles) _ Dennis Wayne Spanger was
meticulous and in the end it became predictable. He dressed well,
drove a silver Jaguar, and police say he chose Fridays to cruise
east Ventura County looking for homes to burglarize. He cased
possible targets the same way: He knocked on the door and asked for
Gary Sellers if someone answered the door. If no one was at home,
he would slip around back and pry open a door or window. He was
neat. Always putting things back in the drawers. Cops say some
people probably got broken into and didn't even know it. Spangler
was arraigned Tuesday on eight counts of burglary and two of
attempted burglary, but cops say he is suspected of breaking into
62 homes since January and may have stolen as much as $400,000 in
loot before he was nailed Friday by detectives who knew he liked to
cruise Ventura County on Fridays for victims. By Kevin F. Sherry.

   LA-COP-PROBE (Los Angeles) _ The L.A. police officers' union
says four of its directors are the subjects of LAPD investigations,
and it has filed an unfair labor-practices complaint over the
probes. The latest subject is Sgt. Dennis Zine, an outspoken
director of the police officers union and an elected charter-reform
commissioner, who LAPD officials say will be relieved of duty and
will face charges in a sexual misconduct case. Female officer
Denise Ward, 36, filed a lawsuit accusing Zine, 51, of sexual
misconduct during a 1997 business trip in Canada. Union officials
say the allegations may be retaliatory against Zine, who has been
critical of Chief Bernard Parks, but a spokesman for Parks says
politics has nothing to do with it. Other targets of investigations
include union President Dave Hepburn, who allegedly made improper
comments to a member of the public, and past president Cliff Ruff.

   LA-CLIFFS-FIX (Los Angeles) _ Caltrans crews Wednesday used
helicopters and a team of rock climbers to begin shoring up a cliff
above Pacific Coast Highway threatening to crash down on commuters
and beachgoers. More than 230 giant panels were airlifted to the
cliff and climbers began weaving them together. The area for repair
is adjacent to where two homes were torn down just a month ago. The
work, which caused traffic congestion for 10 miles between Malibu
and Santa Monica, will continue Thursday. By Melissa Schmitt. (Will

technology and patents galore. But the company could not deny it

 Por CLAIRE POOLE, con SALLY BOWEN en Lima, BRENDAN M. CASE en
Mexico D.F., DOUGLASS STINSON en Miami y MERY GALANTERNICK en Rio
de Janeiro 
 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    El sector turistico de AmErica Latina abre sus puertas a un gran
numero de visitantes e inversionistas extranjeros.
 &HT;    Es dificil conseguir estadisticas, pero Brasil, Argentina y
Chile disfrutan de un saludable incremento en el numero de turistas
extranjeros. Tras sufrir problemas con las guerrillas y el mal
tiempo, el turismo de Mexico y Peru ya supera los obstaculos. Y
ahora que la paz ha llegado a Centroamerica, paises como Costa
Rica, Guatemala y Nicaragua atraen a mas visitantes extranjeros en
busca de un destino turistico economico.
 &HT;    ``Latinoamerica ha sido territorio virgen por mucho tiempo,''
dice Scott Berman, director de servicios de asesoria de
hospitalidad en la firma consultora norteamericana Coopers &AMP;
Lybrand. ``Pero el turismo ya crece.''
 &HT;    Por que? La infraestructura que apoya al turismo (acceso aereo,
hoteles, transporte terrestre, operadores de turismo, etc.) ha
mejorado considerablemente en muchos paises de la region, sobre
todo en Argentina y Chile. Brasil y Peru tambien logran avances, al
igual que muchos paises centroamericanos. La tendencia ha llamado
la atencion de operadores de hoteles regionales y extranjeros. Unas
25 cadenas hoteleras han invertido mas de US$750 millones en
America Latina en los ultimos cinco anos, segun un nuevo estudio de
la consultora estadounidense KPMG Peat Marwick.
 &HT;    Por ejemplo, el Grupo Posadas, de Mexico, tiene un Fiesta Inn de
cuatro estrellas en Belice y ya compro terrenos para levantar un
nuevo Fiesta Americana de cinco estrellas en Caracas. Pero la gran
noticia llego a principios de mayo, cuando la compania adquirio la
marca Caesar Park para America Latina por US$123 millones. La venta
abarco a tres hoteles, dos en Brasil (Rio de Janeiro y Sao Paulo) y
uno en Argentina (Buenos Aires). La compra convirtio a Posadas en
la mayor empresa hotelera de America Latina, con 51 hoteles en
cinco paises.
 &HT;    Entre las inversiones foraneas recientes estan los planes de
Choice Atlantica Hotels, una franquicia de Choice Hotels
International (EU), de construir y operar 100 hoteles en America
Latina en asociacion con un fondo administrado por Darby Overseas
Investments, una firma de capital de riesgo dirigida por Nicholas
Brady, ex secretario del Tesoro de Estados Unidos.
 &HT;    ``El notable rendimiento economico de America Latina [en
1997]*combinado con las recientes reformas de mercado, ha creado
las condiciones para un alza sostenida en la inversion hotelera,''
dijo Clay Dickinson, ejecutivo de la division de bienes raices y
hospitalidad de KPMG, al divulgar el estudio.
 &HT;    El turismo nacional tambien parece mejorar, sobre todo en paises
como Brasil y Mexico. Con la mejoria de muchas economias de la
region, la reduccion del desempleo y el aumento del ingreso real,
muchos se sienten mas dispuestos y tienen mas posibilidades de irse
de vacaciones. Otro factor es la baja de precios de las aerolineas
locales, sobre todo en Brasil.
 &HT;    El turismo dentro de la region tambien crece: los argentinos
visitan Uruguay, los brasilenos se lanzan a recorrer Argentina y
los chilenos se aventuran hasta Mexico. Es mas facil cruzar
fronteras en el marco de acuerdos multilaterales de comercio como
el Mercosur. Tambien es mucho mas economico viajar a paises
cercanos que desplazarse a Estados Unidos o Europa.
 &HT;    Berman piensa que esta tendencia ha creado para los empresarios
internacionales una oportunidad enorme de atender a los turistas de
la capa media del mercado, en vez de dirigirse a los del escalon
superior. ``El turismo regional esta realmente en estado
embrionario y muchas veces se le pasa por alto,'' dice Berman.
``Pero hay que tenerlo en cuenta.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    BRASIL
 &HT;    Las autoridades del turismo brasileno se han fijado la meta de
situar firmemente al pais en el mapa del turismo internacional para
fines de esta decada. Como parte de un programa quinquenal que
comenzo en 1996, el gobierno ha comenzado a desregular el mercado
de los viajes aereos e invierte fuertes sumas en el sector
turistico.
 &HT;    Embratur, la agencia de turismo de Brasil, y el Banco
Interamericano de Desarrollo, han comenzado a invertir US$1.200
millones para mejorar las vias, los aeropuertos y la sanidad en
tres regiones turisticas de Brasil: el Nordeste, el Amazonas y el
Pantanal.
 &HT;    El sector privado responde positivamente a la accion del
gobierno. Se han asignado unos US$5.000 millones en proyectos
privados para construir hoteles y parques de diversiones antes del
ano 2000. A principios de este ano, Terra Encantada, la respuesta
brasilena a Disneyworld, abrio sus puertas en Rio de Janeiro, tras
una inversion de US$300 millones de empresarios brasilenos.
 &HT;    Y los turistas extranjeros ya comenzaron a llegar. Despues de
caer a un millon en 1990, crecio a 2,6 millones en 1996. Las cifras
oficiales de 1997 aun no se han divulgado, pero las autoridades
calculan que mas de tres millones de extranjeros visitaron Brasil
el ano pasado.
 &HT;    El turismo nacional tambien esta en alza. Aunque Embratur no
tiene cifras oficiales, la agencia brasilena de aeropuertos
Infraero informa que el numero de pasajeros brasilenos marco el ano
pasado un record de 22 millones, frente a 13 millones en 1993. Los
funcionarios de turismo esperan un 20 por ciento mas este ano
debido a una campana de TV para animar a los brasilenos a conocer
su pais.
 &HT;    La desregulacion del mercado de los viajes aereos ha contribuido
al aumento. A principios de este ano, se autorizo a las aerolineas
a reducir el precio de los pasajes nacionales en hasta el 65 por
ciento de la tarifa fijada por el gobierno. Como resultado, se ha
desatado una guerra de precios entre las aerolineas brasilenas.
Varig, la mayor de Brasil, ofrece un descuento del 60 por ciento al
Nordeste. Por ejemplo, un pasaje de ida de Rio de Janeiro a Recife
bajo de US$380 a US$172. El pasaje de ida de Rio a Salvador tambien
bajo, de US$291 a US$131. Las aerolineas VASP, TAM y Transbrasil
tambien han reducido las tarifas en ciertas rutas.
 &HT;    Los hoteles de Brasil tambien se han subido al carro de los
descuentos. Unos 300 miembros de la Asociacion Brasilena de Hoteles
tienen descuentos del 30 por ciento al 50 por ciento en la
temporada baja, de agosto a noviembre. Lo mismo ocurre con las
companias de alquiler de automoviles, que ofrecen descuentos del 20
por ciento al 50 por ciento.
 &HT;    Francisco Amaro Ripardo, por ejemplo, esta entusiasmado con los
descuentos. Amaro, portero de 38 anos y vecino de Rio, por fin pudo
ahorrar lo suficiente para llevar a su hija a visitar a sus
familiares en el Nordeste. Pero no podia pagar el pasaje aereo, de
modo que fueron en autobus, y el viaje les costo US$400. ``Ahora,
con estos pasajes de avion baratos, quien sabe,'' dice. ``Pronto
los podre visitar otra vez y llevar a toda la familia. Y en
avion.''
 &HT;    Pero quedan varios problemas por resolver. La modificacion de
las leyes que permitan a los cruceros extranjeros explorar las
costas brasilenas aun se debate, y el alto costo de los pasajes
aereos internacionales se considera uno de los mayores obstaculos a
la industria turistica brasilena.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MEXICO
 &HT;    Despues de las dificultades de 1997 causadas por el frio y el
huracan Pauline, el enorme sector turistico mexicano experimenta
una modesta recuperacion.
 &HT;    En el primer trimestre, el trafico de pasajeros en los
aeropuertos mexicanos crecio casi el 10 por ciento, y el numero de
vueos aumento el 3,7 por ciento. El indice de alojamiento en los
hoteles subio casi el 10 por ciento en comparacion con el ano
anterior durante la Semana Santa. La Secretaria de Turismo (Sectur)
pronostica que el numero de visitas de turistas crecera un
saludable 6 por ciento este ano.
 &HT;    El turismo es indudablemente uno de los pilares de la estrategia
de desarrollo de Mexico a largo plazo. Los ingresos que dejaron mas
de 20 millones de turistas extranjeros (principalmente
estadounidenses y canadienses, pero tambien una cifra cuantiosa de
europeos, latinoamericanos y japoneses) llegaron casi a US$7.700
millones el ano pasado, 11,5 por ciento mas que en 1996. Los
analistas calculan que si se incluye el turismo nacional, el tamano
del sector por lo menos duplicaria esa cifra.
 &HT;    El sector es ya la tercera fuente de divisas despues de las
maquiladoras y el petroleo. Tambien constituye el 5 por ciento del
PIB y genera 1,7 millones de empleos, el 6 por ciento de la fuerza
laboral.
 &HT;    Pero a largo plazo el sector turistico mexicano afronta varios
desafios. Por ejemplo, su presencia apenas se siente fuera de los
famosos centros vacacionales en las playas y de unas cuantas
ciudades coloniales. Para rectificar esa situacion, Sectur trabaja
con varios paises centroamericanos para promover el ``Mundo Maya,''
que abarca las playas y las ruinas de la peninsula de Yucatan y la
ciudad colonial de Merida.
 &HT;    El ecoturismo tambien aporta fondos en lugares fuera de lo
comun. Hoy 48 companias ofrecen paquetes de ecoturismo; en 1994
eran solo ocho. Tambien surgen campos de golf por todo el pais, y
el centro vacacional Los Cabos, en Baja California Sur, se ha
convertido en un centro de golf y pesca deportiva. Las cadenas
Ritz-Carlton, de Estados Unidos, y Four Seasons, de Canada,
estudian construir hoteles en la zona.
 &HT;    Una posible atraccion nueva, los casinos, aun esta en un limbo.
El Congreso mexicano debe decidir su suerte en su proximo periodo
de sesiones, que comienza en septiembre. Se espera que la
Asociacion Mexicana de Hoteles y Moteles presente a los
congresistas un estudio a favor de los casinos.
 &HT;    Otro reto: atraer a mas europeos y latinoamericanos. Los
brasilenos se han convertido en un pilar de Cancun gracias en parte
a la fortaleza de su moneda, mientras las agencias de viaje de
Chile informan que los viajes a Mexico se han puesto de moda.
 &HT;    El gran problema es la delincuencia. Los gobiernos de Estados
Unidos, varios paises europeos, Japon y otras naciones han emitido
advertencias sobre los peligros en la capital mexicana,
especialmente en los taxis. Si no se pone fin a la ola de delitos,
las cosas podrian empeorar.
 &HT;    Aunque todavia no hay un efecto visible, la delincuencia podria
tener un efecto negativo en la actividad turistica de Mexico. Un
reciente examen del Centro de Estudios de Turismo de Sectur revelo
que la primera queja de los visitantes extranjeros era la falta de
seguridad publica.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, el secretario de Turismo de Mexico, Oscar Espinosa
Villarreal, dijo recientemente que hay planes de construir
instalaciones turisticas a un costo de casi US$2.000 millones,
aunque no aclaro cuando se pondrian en marcha.
 &HT;    Entre las cadenas hoteleras extranjeras, Hilton, de EU, ha sido
la mas activa. Tras marcharse de Mexico en los anos 60, hace poco
abrio un hotel en la terminal internacional del aeropuerto de
Mexico D.F. Construye otro en Ciudad Juarez, que debe estar
terminado en noviembre, y uno mas en Monterrey que se concluira a
principios del ano proximo.
 &HT;    El banco de inversion Goldman Sachs, de Nueva York, a traves de
su fondo de bienes raices en mercados emergentes, tambien ve con
optimismo las perspectivas del pais. Ha adquirido participaciones
en el centro turistico Las Palmillas, en Los Cabos; el Four Seasons
de Mexico D.F. y la cadena mexicana de hoteles de lujo Grupo Quinta
Real.
 &HT;    Entretanto, el gobierno tiene en venta varias propiedades
turisticas. La joya de la corona es Hoteles Camino Real, una cadena
de 15 hoteles de lujo que el gobierno confisco a un grupo de
inversionistas encabezado por el banquero fugitivo Carlos Cabal
Peniche. Se ignora quienes seran los compradores, pero al menos se
espera una participacion extranjera.
 &HT;    Los acreedores tambien han dado luz verde al gigante turistico
Situr, agobiado por las deudas, para que ponga en venta algunos de
sus 29 hoteles.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    PERU
 &HT;    Las imponentes ruinas incaicas de Machu Picchu son a la vez una
bendicion y una maldicion para la industria turistica peruana, aun
en una fase incipiente.
 &HT;    Como las ruinas tienen fama universal, no hace falta mucha
publicidad para atraer multitudes. Pero ocultan al visitante otras
atracciones menos espectaculares. Al crecer el numero de turistas,
el dolor de cabeza del transporte necesario para llevar a los
visitantes a la remota fortaleza en las montanas, que se alza sobre
un profundo canon sin acceso vial, hace que el viaje a Machu Picchu
sea cada ano mas fatigoso y menos atractivo.
 &HT;    Por uerte, las iniciativas para aliviar el cuello de botella de
Machu Picchu, aunque han tardado, ya estan en marcha. Avanzan las
privatizaciones de la infraestructura de transporte. Se espera que
cuatro consorcios hagan ofertas para la construccion de un
funicular que llevara a los viajeros desde el valle hasta las
alturas de Machu Picchu con rapidez y comodidad. La ferroviaria
estatal Enafer, que dirige el mejorado pero aun inadecuado tren
para turistas desde la ciudad de Cuzco hasta las ruinas, se
transferira este ano a una empresa privada.
 &HT;    Los hoteles de la antigua cadena estatal Enturperu tambien se
han vendido (o se han dado en concesion) a operadores privados que
han mejorado el servicio en cierto grado. El Hotel Valle Sagrado de
los Inkas en Cuzco paso a manos de inversionistas britanicos y esta
administrado por suizos y norteamericanos.
 &HT;    Las empresas hoteleras foraneas parecen haber descubierto el
potencial peruano. Swisshotels, filial de la aerolinea suiza
Swissair, acaba de comprar el mejor hotel de Lima, el Oro Verde.
Hilton y otras cadenas como Marriott (EU) e Inter-Continental
(Reino Unido) construyen hoteles de cinco estrellas en Lima con
socios locales, mientras Holiday Inn (EU) compro un hotel en Lima y
otro en Cuzco.
 &HT;    Aunque las condiciones del sector turistico parecen mejorar, los
hoteleros y los operadores de turismo se quejan de que el gobierno
ni promueve ni planifica una industria turistica moderna, ni
incentiva a los empresarios privados para que hagan el trabajo.
 &HT;    ``El sector esta en un caos,'' afirma Eduardo Arrarte,
presidente y fundador de Lima Tours, la principal agencia turistica
de Peru. ``Hay demasiadas organizaciones y no hay comunicacion
entre ellas. A pesar de los cientos de estudios costosos sobre el
sector, en mi opinion no hay una sola persona en Peru que sea
experta en turismo.''
 &HT;    Segun el ministro de Comercio, Industria y Vivienda, Gustavo
Caillaux, a cuya cartera pertenece el turismo, el objetivo del
gobierno es duplicar la contribucion a la economia del sector
turistico cada cinco anos. Eso significa un crecimiento del 15 por
ciento al ano.
 &HT;    Los funcionarios de gobierno solian calcular la cantidad de
turistas que visitaria Peru. Pero en el pasado fueron demasiado
optimistas. El ano pasado, las cifras oficiales muestran que
700.000 extranjeros visitaron el pais, el 10 por ciento mas que en
1996 pero 50.000 menos que el objetivo del gobierno. Los turistas
``reales'' representan mas de la tercera parte de esa cifra; el
resto esta compuesto por empresarios o peruanos radicados en el
exterior.
 &HT;    El gobierno trata de incrementar la suma que gastan los
visitantes. Tiene que esforzarse. El ano pasado, el gasto promedio
fue de US$1.684 por turista (sin incluir el pasaje aereo) y la
estadia promedio fue de 13 noches, segun Caillaux.
 &HT;    Quiza con miras a convencer a los escepticos empresarios
privados de su genuino interes en el turismo, Promperu, la agencia
de promocion de la imagen del pais, preparo recientemente un
``Perfil del Turista Extranjero 1998,'' que presento solemnemente a
la camara nacional de turismo, Canatur, a fines de enero.
 &HT;    El perfil, realizado en el cuarto trimestre de 1997, se basa en
1.750 entrevistas con operadores de turismo y visitantes
extranjeros. Cargado de la terminologia empresarial moderna, pide
la ``conversion de Peru en un producto turistico competitivo'' con
una ``estrategia de mercadeo enfocada'' y una ``promocion integral
con identidad.''
 &HT;    Aunque el estudio de Promperu indico que el 68 por ciento de los
turistas quedaron ``muy satisfechos'' y el 29 por ciento
``satisfecho'' de sus visitas, abundaron las criticas contra el
transporte y la infraestructura.
 &HT;    La situacion de los vuelos nacionales es especialmente penosa.
Como consecuencia de una feroz guerra de reduccion de precios, solo
dos aerolineas ofrecen vuelos nacionales. Hace dos anos, eran ocho.
 &HT;    No obstante, grupos de inversionistas privados (peruanos en
asociacion con extranjeros) estudian invertir en dos nuevas
aerolineas nacionales, lo que debe impulsar el turismo local.
 &HT;    Entretanto, Peru espera mas extranjeros. En abril, American
Airlines inauguro un servicio directo Miami-Cuzco, que debe aliviar
la congestion actual de los vuelos.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    AMERICA CENTRAL
 &HT;    Con la llegada de la paz al istmo, muchos paises
centroamericanos hacen todo lo posible por conseguir divisas
atrayendo a mas turistas a sus ruinas, playas y centros ecologicos.
 &HT;    En Guatemala, por ejemplo, despues de 36 anos de guerra civil,
se firmo un acuerdo de paz con la guerrilla a fines de 1996. Aunque
el Departamento de Estado de Estados Unidos todavia advierte a los
norteamericanos que hay problemas de seguridad, Guatemala logro
atraer un 10 por ciento mas de visitantes extranjeros el ano pasado
que en 1996.
 &HT;    El gobierno ha reasignado fondos que se destinaban al ejercito
para mejorar la infraestructura del pais. Ha construido caminos
desde Los Encuentros hasta el popular pueblo comercial de
Chichicastenango y hace obras de mejoramiento en el enlace
terrestre de Rio Dulce a Flores, donde estan algunas de las ruinas
mayas mas espectaculares. El gobierno tambien ha renovado su Museo
Arqueologico Nacional, celebre por su coleccion de piezas mayas y
de otros pueblos indigenas.
 &HT;    Las empresas extranjeras han entrado en escena. Se han
construido varios hoteles, entre ellos un Inter-Continental (Gran
Bretana) en Ciudad de Guatemala y varios en Tikal, en el Peten.
 &HT;    Pero Guatemala tiene que competir con la vecina Costa Rica, que
tiene la democracia mas antigua de America Latina. En vez de gastar
el dinero de los contribuyentes en las fuerzas armadas, Costa Rica
tiene un largo historial de asignacion de recursos al sector
turistico. El resultado es que el pais atrae a 800.000 visitantes
extranjeros y obtiene US$700 millones en ingresos por concepto de
turismo cada ano, mas que la produccion de cafe y bananos.
 &HT;    Aunque la delincuencia callejera ha aumentado en cierta medida
en San Jose, los visitantes (y los inversionistas) extranjeros
siguen llegando. Se han abierto varios centros vacacionales grandes
y pequenos en la costa del Pacifico, en la provincia de Guanacaste.
El mayor es el lujoso Melia Playa Conchal Beach &AMP; Golf Resort, de
364 hectareas, cuya construccion costo US$70 millones.
 &HT;    Se espera que la industria turistica de Costa Rica reciba un
impulso de Continental Airlines, que tiene planeado iniciar en
julio un servicio diario sin escala de Newark, Nueva Jersey, a San
Jose, justo a tiempo para el aumento de viajes en el verano del
hemisferio norte. ``Costa Rica es una de las areas nuevas mas
atractivas,'' dice Berman.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    PERSPECTIVAS
 &HT;    Ante el esperado crecimiento economico en America Latina, la
liberalizacion del trafico aereo y mas inversiones de cadenas
hoteleras, se proyecta que el sector turistico de la region
disfrute de un importante crecimiento. ``Veremos entrar mas capital
de inversion y mas construccion de hoteles,'' dice Dickinson, cuya
encuesta de KPMG muestra que las cadenas hoteleras planean invertir
de US$2.000 millones a US$3.000 millones en la region en los
proximos cinco anos. ``Solo hemos visto la punta del iceberg.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    El sector turistico de AmErica Latina abre sus puertas a un gran
numero de visitantes e inversionistas extranjeros.
 &HT;    Es dificil conseguir estadisticas, pero Brasil, Argentina y
Chile disfrutan de un saludable incremento en el numero de turistas
extranjeros. Tras sufrir problemas con las guerrillas y el mal
tiempo, el turismo de Mexico y Peru ya supera los obstaculos. Y
ahora que la paz ha llegado a Centroamerica, paises como Costa
Rica, Guatemala y Nicaragua atraen a mas visitantes extranjeros en
busca de un destino turistico economico.
 &HT;    ``Latinoamerica ha sido territorio virgen por mucho tiempo,''
dice Scott Berman, director de servicios de asesoria de
hospitalidad en la firma consultora norteamericana Coopers &AMP;
Lybrand. ``Pero el turismo ya crece.''
 &HT;    Por que? La infraestructura que apoya al turismo (acceso aereo,
hoteles, transporte terrestre, operadores de turismo, etc.) ha
mejorado considerablemente en muchos paises de la region, sobre
todo en Argentina y Chile. Brasil y Peru tambien logran avances, al
igual que muchos paises centroamericanos. La tendencia ha llamado
la atencion de operadores de hoteles regionales y extranjeros. Unas
25 cadenas hoteleras han invertido mas de US$750 millones en
America Latina en los ultimos cinco anos, segun un nuevo estudio de
la consultora estadounidense KPMG Peat Marwick.
 &HT;    Por ejemplo, el Grupo Posadas, de Mexico, tiene un Fiesta Inn de
cuatro estrellas en Belice y ya compro terrenos para levantar un
nuevo Fiesta Americana de cinco estrellas en Caracas. Pero la gran
noticia llego a principios de mayo, cuando la compania adquirio la
marca Caesar Park para America Latina por US$123 millones. La venta
abarco a tres hoteles, dos en Brasil (Rio de Janeiro y Sao Paulo) y
uno en Argentina (Buenos Aires). La compra convirtio a Posadas en
la mayor empresa hotelera de America Latina, con 51 hoteles en
cinco paises.
 &HT;    Entre las inversiones foraneas recientes estan los planes de
Choice Atlantica Hotels, una franquicia de Choice Hotels
International (EU), de construir y operar 100 hoteles en America
Latina en asociacion con un fondo administrado por Darby Overseas
Investments, una firma de capital de riesgo dirigida por Nicholas
Brady, ex secretario del Tesoro de Estados Unidos.
 &HT;    ``El notable rendimiento economico de America Latina [en
1997]*combinado con las recientes reformas de mercado, ha creado
las condiciones para un alza sostenida en la inversion hotelera,''
dijo Clay Dickinson, ejecutivo de la division de bienes raices y
hospitalidad de KPMG, al divulgar el estudio.
 &HT;    El turismo nacional tambien parece mejorar, sobre todo en paises
como Brasil y Mexico. Con la mejoria de muchas economias de la
region, la reduccion del desempleo y el aumento del ingreso real,
muchos se sienten mas dispuestos y tienen mas posibilidades de irse
de vacaciones. Otro factor es la baja de precios de las aerolineas
locales, sobre todo en Brasil.
 &HT;    El turismo dentro de la region tambien crece: los argentinos
visitan Uruguay, los brasilenos se lanzan a recorrer Argentina y
los chilenos se aventuran hasta Mexico. Es mas facil cruzar
fronteras en el marco de acuerdos multilaterales de comercio como
el Mercosur. Tambien es mucho mas economico viajar a paises
cercanos que desplazarse a Estados Unidos o Europa.
 &HT;    Berman piensa que esta tendencia ha creado para los empresarios
internacionales una oportunidad enorme de atender a los turistas de
la capa media del mercado, en vez de dirigirse a los del escalon
superior. ``El turismo regional esta realmente en estado
embrionario y muchas veces se le pasa por alto,'' dice Berman.
``Pero hay que tenerlo en cuenta.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    BRASIL
 &HT;    Las autoridades del turismo brasileno se han fijado la meta de
situar firmemente al pais en el mapa del turismo internacional para
fines de esta decada. Como parte de un programa quinquenal que
comenzo en 1996, el gobierno ha comenzado a desregular el mercado
de los viajes aereos e invierte fuertes sumas en el sector
turistico.
 &HT;    Embratur, la agencia de turismo de Brasil, y el Banco
Interamericano de Desarrollo, han comenzado a invertir US$1.200
millones para mejorar las vias, los aeropuertos y la sanidad en
tres regiones turisticas de Brasil: el Nordeste, el Amazonas y el
Pantanal.
 &HT;    El sector privado responde positivamente a la accion del
gobierno. Se han asignado unos US$5.000 millones en proyectos
privados para construir hoteles y parques de diversiones antes del
ano 2000. A principios de este ano, Terra Encantada, la respuesta
brasilena a Disneyworld, abrio sus puertas en Rio de Janeiro, tras
una inversion de US$300 millones de empresarios brasilenos.
 &HT;    Y los turistas extranjeros ya comenzaron a llegar. Despues de
caer a un millon en 1990, crecio a 2,6 millones en 1996. Las cifras
oficiales de 1997 aun no se han divulgado, pero las autoridades
calculan que mas de tres millones de extranjeros visitaron Brasil
el ano pasado.
 &HT;    El turismo nacional tambien esta en alza. Aunque Embratur no
tiene cifras oficiales, la agencia brasilena de aeropuertos
Infraero informa que el numero de pasajeros brasilenos marco el ano
pasado un record de 22 millones, frente a 13 millones en 1993. Los
funcionarios de turismo esperan un 20 por ciento mas este ano
debido a una campana de TV para animar a los brasilenos a conocer
su pais.
 &HT;    La desregulacion del mercado de los viajes aereos ha contribuido
al aumento. A principios de este ano, se autorizo a las aerolineas
a reducir el precio de los pasajes nacionales en hasta el 65 por
ciento de la tarifa fijada por el gobierno. Como resultado, se ha
desatado una guerra de precios entre las aerolineas brasilenas.
Varig, la mayor de Brasil, ofrece un descuento del 60 por ciento al
Nordeste. Por ejemplo, un pasaje de ida de Rio de Janeiro a Recife
bajo de US$380 a US$172. El pasaje de ida de Rio a Salvador tambien
bajo, de US$291 a US$131. Las aerolineas VASP, TAM y Transbrasil
tambien han reducido las tarifas en ciertas rutas.
 &HT;    Los hoteles de Brasil tambien se han subido al carro de los
descuentos. Unos 300 miembros de la Asociacion Brasilena de Hoteles
tienen descuentos del 30 por ciento al 50 por ciento en la
temporada baja, de agosto a noviembre. Lo mismo ocurre con las
companias de alquiler de automoviles, que ofrecen descuentos del 20
por ciento al 50 por ciento.
 &HT;    Francisco Amaro Ripardo, por ejemplo, esta entusiasmado con los
descuentos. Amaro, portero de 38 anos y vecino de Rio, por fin pudo
ahorrar lo suficiente para llevar a su hija a visitar a sus
familiares en el Nordeste. Pero no podia pagar el pasaje aereo, de
modo que fueron en autobus, y el viaje les costo US$400. ``Ahora,
con estos pasajes de avion baratos, quien sabe,'' dice. ``Pronto
los podre visitar otra vez y llevar a toda la familia. Y en
avion.''
 &HT;    Pero quedan varios problemas por resolver. La modificacion de
las leyes que permitan a los cruceros extranjeros explorar las
costas brasilenas aun se debate, y el alto costo de los pasajes
aereos internacionales se considera uno de los mayores obstaculos a
la industria turistica brasilena.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MEXICO
 &HT;    Despues de las dificultades de 1997 causadas por el frio y el
huracan Pauline, el enorme sector turistico mexicano experimenta
una modesta recuperacion.
 &HT;    En el primer trimestre, el trafico de pasajeros en los
aeropuertos mexicanos crecio casi el 10 por ciento, y el numero de
vueos aumento el 3,7 por ciento. El indice de alojamiento en los
hoteles subio casi el 10 por ciento en comparacion con el ano
anterior durante la Semana Santa. La Secretaria de Turismo (Sectur)
pronostica que el numero de visitas de turistas crecera un
saludable 6 por ciento este ano.
 &HT;    El turismo es indudablemente uno de los pilares de la estrategia
de desarrollo de Mexico a largo plazo. Los ingresos que dejaron mas
de 20 millones de turistas extranjeros (principalmente
estadounidenses y canadienses, pero tambien una cifra cuantiosa de
europeos, latinoamericanos y japoneses) llegaron casi a US$7.700
millones el ano pasado, 11,5 por ciento mas que en 1996. Los
analistas calculan que si se incluye el turismo nacional, el tamano
del sector por lo menos duplicaria esa cifra.
 &HT;    El sector es ya la tercera fuente de divisas despues de las
maquiladoras y el petroleo. Tambien constituye el 5 por ciento del
PIB y genera 1,7 millones de empleos, el 6 por ciento de la fuerza
laboral.
 &HT;    Pero a largo plazo el sector turistico mexicano afronta varios
desafios. Por ejemplo, su presencia apenas se siente fuera de los
famosos centros vacacionales en las playas y de unas cuantas
ciudades coloniales. Para rectificar esa situacion, Sectur trabaja
con varios paises centroamericanos para promover el ``Mundo Maya,''
que abarca las playas y las ruinas de la peninsula de Yucatan y la
ciudad colonial de Merida.
 &HT;    El ecoturismo tambien aporta fondos en lugares fuera de lo
comun. Hoy 48 companias ofrecen paquetes de ecoturismo; en 1994
eran solo ocho. Tambien surgen campos de golf por todo el pais, y
el centro vacacional Los Cabos, en Baja California Sur, se ha
convertido en un centro de golf y pesca deportiva. Las cadenas
Ritz-Carlton, de Estados Unidos, y Four Seasons, de Canada,
estudian construir hoteles en la zona.
 &HT;    Una posible atraccion nueva, los casinos, aun esta en un limbo.
El Congreso mexicano debe decidir su suerte en su proximo periodo
de sesiones, que comienza en septiembre. Se espera que la
Asociacion Mexicana de Hoteles y Moteles presente a los
congresistas un estudio a favor de los casinos.
 &HT;    Otro reto: atraer a mas europeos y latinoamericanos. Los
brasilenos se han convertido en un pilar de Cancun gracias en parte
a la fortaleza de su moneda, mientras las agencias de viaje de
Chile informan que los viajes a Mexico se han puesto de moda.
 &HT;    El gran problema es la delincuencia. Los gobiernos de Estados
Unidos, varios paises europeos, Japon y otras naciones han emitido
advertencias sobre los peligros en la capital mexicana,
especialmente en los taxis. Si no se pone fin a la ola de delitos,
las cosas podrian empeorar.
 &HT;    Aunque todavia no hay un efecto visible, la delincuencia podria
tener un efecto negativo en la actividad turistica de Mexico. Un
reciente examen del Centro de Estudios de Turismo de Sectur revelo
que la primera queja de los visitantes extranjeros era la falta de
seguridad publica.
 &HT;    Sin embargo, el secretario de Turismo de Mexico, Oscar Espinosa
Villarreal, dijo recientemente que hay planes de construir
instalaciones turisticas a un costo de casi US$2.000 millones,
aunque no aclaro cuando se pondrian en marcha.
 &HT;    Entre las cadenas hoteleras extranjeras, Hilton, de EU, ha sido
la mas activa. Tras marcharse de Mexico en los anos 60, hace poco
abrio un hotel en la terminal internacional del aeropuerto de
Mexico D.F. Construye otro en Ciudad Juarez, que debe estar
terminado en noviembre, y uno mas en Monterrey que se concluira a
principios del ano proximo.
 &HT;    El banco de inversion Goldman Sachs, de Nueva York, a traves de
su fondo de bienes raices en mercados emergentes, tambien ve con
optimismo las perspectivas del pais. Ha adquirido participaciones
en el centro turistico Las Palmillas, en Los Cabos; el Four Seasons
de Mexico D.F. y la cadena mexicana de hoteles de lujo Grupo Quinta
Real.
 &HT;    Entretanto, el gobierno tiene en venta varias propiedades
turisticas. La joya de la corona es Hoteles Camino Real, una cadena
de 15 hoteles de lujo que el gobierno confisco a un grupo de
inversionistas encabezado por el banquero fugitivo Carlos Cabal
Peniche. Se ignora quienes seran los compradores, pero al menos se
espera una participacion extranjera.
 &HT;    Los acreedores tambien han dado luz verde al gigante turistico
Situr, agobiado por las deudas, para que ponga en venta algunos de
sus 29 hoteles.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    PERU
 &HT;    Las imponentes ruinas incaicas de Machu Picchu son a la vez una
bendicion y una maldicion para la industria turistica peruana, aun
en una fase incipiente.
 &HT;    Como las ruinas tienen fama universal, no hace falta mucha
publicidad para atraer multitudes. Pero ocultan al visitante otras
atracciones menos espectaculares. Al crecer el numero de turistas,
el dolor de cabeza del transporte necesario para llevar a los
visitantes a la remota fortaleza en las montanas, que se alza sobre
un profundo canon sin acceso vial, hace que el viaje a Machu Picchu
sea cada ano mas fatigoso y menos atractivo.
 &HT;    Por suerte, las iniciativas para aliviar el cuello de botella de
Machu Picchu, aunque han tardado, ya estan en marcha. Avanzan las
privatizaciones de la infraestructura de transporte. Se espera que
cuatro consorcios hagan ofertas para la construccion de un
funicular que llevara a los viajeros desde el valle hasta las
alturas de Machu Picchu con rapidez y comodidad. La ferroviaria
estatal Enafer, que dirige el mejorado pero aun inadecuado tren
para turistas desde la ciudad de Cuzco hasta las ruinas, se
transferira este ano a una empresa privada.
 &HT;    Los hoteles de la antigua cadena estatal Enturperu tambien se
han vendido (o se han dado en concesion) a operadores privados que
han mejorado el servicio en cierto grado. El Hotel Valle Sagrado de
los Inkas en Cuzco paso a manos de inversionistas britanicos y esta
administrado por suizos y norteamericanos.
 &HT;    Las empresas hoteleras foraneas parecen haber descubierto el
potencial peruano. Swisshotels, filial de la aerolinea suiza
Swissair, acaba de comprar el mejor hotel de Lima, el Oro Verde.
Hilton y otras cadenas como Marriott (EU) e Inter-Continental
(Reino Unido) construyen hoteles de cinco estrellas en Lima con
socios locales, mientras Holiday Inn (EU) compro un hotel en Lima y
otro en Cuzco.
 &HT;    Aunque las condiciones del sector turistico parecen mejorar, los
hoteleros y los operadores de turismo se quejan de que el gobierno
ni promueve ni planifica una industria turistica moderna, ni
incentiva a los empresarios privados para que hagan el trabajo.
 &HT;    ``El sector esta en un caos,'' afirma Eduardo Arrarte,
presidente y fundador de Lima Tours, la principal agencia turistica
de Peru. ``Hay demasiadas organizaciones y no hay comunicacion
entre ellas. A pesar de los cientos de estudios costosos sobre el
sector, en mi opinion no hay una sola persona en Peru que sea
experta en turismo.''
 &HT;    Segun el ministro de Comercio, Industria y Vivienda, Gustavo
Caillaux, a cuya cartera pertenece el turismo, el objetivo del
gobierno es duplicar la contribucion a la economia del sector
turistico cada cinco anos. Eso significa un crecimiento del 15 por
ciento al ano.
 &HT;    Los funcionarios de gobierno solian calcular la cantidad de
turistas que visitaria Peru. Pero en el pasado fueron demasiado
optimistas. El ano pasado, las cifras oficiales muestran que
700.000 extranjeros visitaron el pais, el 10 por ciento mas que en
1996 pero 50.000 menos que el objetivo del gobierno. Los turistas
``reales'' representan mas de la tercera parte de esa cifra; el
resto esta compuesto por empresarios o peruanos radicados en el
exterior.
 &HT;    El gobierno trata de incrementar la suma que gastan los
visitantes. Tiene que esforzarse. El ano pasado, el gasto promedio
fue de US$1.684 por turista (sin incluir el pasaje aereo) y la
estadia promedio fue de 13 noches, segun Caillaux.
 &HT;    Quiza con miras a convencer a los escepticos empresarios
privados de su genuino interes en el turismo, Promperu, la agencia
de promocion de la imagen del pais, preparo recientemente un
``Perfil del Turista Extranjero 1998,'' que presento solemnemente a
la camara nacional de turismo, Canatur, a fines de enero.
 &HT;    El perfil, realizado en el cuarto trimestre de 1997, se basa en
1.750 entrevistas con operadores de turismo y visitantes
extranjeros. Cargado de la terminologia empresarial moderna, pide
la ``conversion de Peru en un producto turistico competitivo'' con
una ``estrategia de mercadeo enfocada'' y una ``promocion integral
con identidad.''
 &HT;    Aunque el estudio de Promperu indico que el 68 por ciento de los
turistas quedaron ``muy satisfechos'' y el 29 por ciento
``satisfecho'' de sus visitas, abundaron las criticas contra el
transporte y la infraestructura.
 &HT;    La situacion de los vuelos nacionales es especialmente penosa.
Como consecuencia de una feroz guerra de reduccion de precios, solo
dos aerolineas ofrecen vuelos nacionales. Hace dos anos, eran ocho.
 &HT;    No obstante, grupos de inversionistas privados (peruanos en
asociacion con extranjeros) estudian invertir en dos nuevas
aerolineas nacionales, lo que debe impulsar el turismo local.
 &HT;    Entretanto, Peru espera mas extranjeros. En abril, American
Airlines inauguro un servicio directo Miami-Cuzco, que debe aliviar
la congestion actual de los vuelos.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    AMERICA CENTRAL
 &HT;    Con la llegada de la paz al istmo, muchos paises
centroamericanos hacen todo lo posible por conseguir divisas
atrayendo a mas turistas a sus ruinas, playas y centros ecologicos.
 &HT;    En Guatemala, por ejemplo, despues de 36 anos de guerra civil,
se firmo un acuerdo de paz con la guerrilla a fines de 1996. Aunque
el Departamento de Estado de Estados Unidos todavia advierte a los
norteamericanos que hay problemas de seguridad, Guatemala logro
atraer un 10 por ciento mas de visitantes extranjeros el ano pasado
que en 1996.
 &HT;    El gobierno ha reasignado fondos que se destinaban al ejercito

Chichicastenango y hace obras de mejoramiento en el enlace
terrestre de Rio Dulce a Flores, donde estan algunas de las ruinas

 &HT;    Las empresas extranjeras han entrado en escena. Se han

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Does he or doesn't he?
</P>
<P>
   Does Bob Kerrey, war hero, self-made millionaire restaurateur,
blue-eyed bachelor, Nebraska senator, crave the presidency enough
to chase after it again?
</P>
<P>
   Even he does not know for sure.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the 54-year-old senator admits he is ``preparing''
for the daunting task of challenging Vice President Al Gore for the
Democratic nomination in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months Kerrey has hired a small staff in New Hampshire
and a national political director. He has also created a political
action committee that will heighten his national profile.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee for the past
three and one-half years, Kerrey has raised record sums _ about $75
million _ for Democratic candidates. He has positioned himself on
the correct committees and commissions. In the Senate, he has
focused on Social Security and Medicare reform, and he serves as
the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee.
</P>
<P>
   And he has already given speeches and flipped pancakes in the
crucial early campaign states of Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   He has a personal story that makes him a picture-perfect
candidate: A Navy Seal in Vietnam in 1969, loses his leg below the
knee, is awarded the Medal of Honor and emerges stronger after a
slow and painful physical and emotional recovery.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked why he wants to be president, he replied, almost
reflexively, ``I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Only after those words tumble out does he add that he is giving
himself until the end of the year to ponder the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll either run for president or run for re-election to the
Senate or run for cover in the private sector,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is presumed to be seeking the nomination, as is House
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri and Minnesota Sen. Paul
Wellstone. Kerrey's potential entry into the race is less known,
and he acknowledges that the lust for the Oval Office has not yet
filled his heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to desire it, based on the powerful belief that this
is how I should serve,'' Kerrey said. ``I'm not there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, Joseph Robert Kerrey could not project that
passion either and he failed miserably when he sought the 1992
nomination. Criticized then for his lack of discipline and
organization and inability to connect with audiences, Kerrey has
now taken his Vietnam odyssey and transformed it into a powerful
story that he tells around the country.
</P>
<P>
   He describes how an unjust war stole a wounded young soldier's
patriotism, and how he regained it with the help of the men and
women _ government employees _ who helped put his body back
together.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent Iowa seminar for people active in Democratic
politics, he held his audience spellbound as he spoke of the
soldier who ``suddenly couldn't walk. He couldn't leave his bed. He
couldn't go to the bathroom without asking somebody for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, he doubted nothing,'' Kerrey went on. ``After, he
doubted everything.'' In the hospital, ``the bottom fell out of his
life. But his country made him put it back together.'' And the
flame of patriotism ``burned brighter than before.''
</P>
<P>
   He is not afraid of championing complex and potentially
politically dangerous issues, like his proposal to change and
partially privatize Social Security. He has taken positions
unpopular with many Nebraska voters, like opposing a ban on the
late-term procedure called partial-birth abortion by its critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has enormous potential,'' said Bill Carrick, a political
consultant who ran Gephardt's presidential campaign in 1988.
``Obviously there's an incredible life story there. And he doesn't
fit easily into the political boxes. On one side this is a man who
owes his physical recovery to veterans' programs and government
health care, and is not as suspicious of government as the
Republicans. On the other side he's somebody who has spent time in
the private sector and he's not suspicious of the private sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he has become much better at working crowds, sometimes,
one-on-one, he can be a hands-in-his-pockets politician, telling
one man who wanted to discuss abortion that he was late for a photo
session and doing little to draw out a shy young girl pushed to
meet him by her mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such an honest, down-to-earth type of guy,'' said Larry
Bleach, who was visiting Washington with the Nebraska All Stars'
girls' high school basketball team, which he coaches. ``I'd just
love to put a little more passion in him.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey admits that his run for the 1992 nomination was a
disaster. He had never even visited New Hampshire when he announced
his candidacy. He quickly ran out of money, and the campaign ended
almost as soon as it began.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't organize and my message wasn't terribly thought
out,'' he said. ``I didn't connect with the audience or the times.
I wasn't prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, he is determined not to make the same mistake.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since 1992, Kerrey has proved a natural at fund raising, which
he accepts as part of political life. ``You have a piece of work
and you said you were going to do the work and you don't complain
about it, you finish it,'' he said, referring to his assignment
raising money as head of the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   That impulse to gut it out was drilled into him by his father, a
building contractor who, with his wife, a teacher, reared seven
children. Kerrey is writing a book about his father, who died in
1988, and his uncle _ brothers who were separated as orphans in the
1920s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel the presence of my father if I whine,'' Kerrey said.
</P>
<P>
   So it is not surprising that Kerrey is taken aback when asked if
he has the stamina to run for president. Shortly after Kerrey
withdrew from the 1992 race, Bill Shore, his former chief of staff,
revealed that Kerrey was in considerable discomfort from a spare
prosthetic leg he had to wear after his car was broken into and his
gym bag _ with his best prosthetic leg _ was stolen.
</P>
<P>
   He gets annoyed when asked whether it is a political liability
to be up on the podium without a wife (he and his wife divorced
after four years and two children, Ben, now 23, and Lindsey, 21).
</P>
<P>
   His relationship with the actress Debra Winger ended several
years ago, and he has had a relationship for more than three years
with a New York scriptwriter whom he will not name.
</P>
<P>
   But Kerrey has no intention of changing his marital status to
improve his presidential prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you say to me, `Well, but isn't that harder because of the
fact that you don't have a wife or you don't have four limbs or you
don't have an opportunity to make money or you don't have the
opportunity to go to the beach on the weekends?' the answer is
yes,'' he said. ``It's made harder by lots of things.''
</P>
<P>
   More problematic for him is facing the campaign trail alone.
``It's a noticeable problem for me,'' he said, adding ``I'm better
off with a woman. I mean, it affects your decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey is determined at this stage not to compare himself with
Gore. But the issue is so prominent in his mind that he raises it
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get asked fairly frequently, `How are you different from Al
Gore? How are you superior to Al Gore,''' he said. ``Well, I don't
feel superior to Al Gore. I'm not sitting here thinking to myself I
notice all these differences between myself and the vice
president.''

 &HT;    Tanner's announces merger
 &HT;    By Mickey H. Gramig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Why would a successful Atlanta-based restaurant chain
merge with a Texas company that's closed all of its restaurants in
the last year, accumulated $11.7 million in losses and is basically
all but defunct?
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, such a merger raises eyebrows, admits Clyde E.
Culp, chairman and chief executive of Tanner's Restaurant Group,
which runs the 12-year-old Rick Tanner's Original Grill chain.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a $6 million reason why TRC Acquisition Corp., the
parent of Tanner's, has agreed to merge with San Antonio-based
Harvest Restaurant Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Harvest is a public company, with easier access to expansion
capital than the privately held Tanner's, said Culp, who explained
the deal is a way for Tanner's to go public without the time, risk
and expense involved in an initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   The merger also will give the new company a $6 million cash
infusion from a private Connecticut group that only invests in
public companies.
</P>
<P>
   After the merger, expected to close in September, the new
company will keep the Tanner's name and be headquartered in
Atlanta. Culp will be chairman and chief executive, and other key
Tanner's executives also will remain with the company, including
President Rick Tanner, who founded the chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not putting up money on this. There's not a lot of risk
for us, other than if for some reason there's some baggage or
problem,'' Culp said.
</P>
<P>
   TRC Acquisition will get a roughly 70 percent stake in the
post-merger company; shareholders of Harvest Restaurant Group will
control the remaining portion.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem that could halt the merger is Harvest's
possible delisting by the Nasdaq stock market. Such action was
threatened in June because the stock's value was below minimum
standards. The stock sold for $5.50 per share in Harvest's July
1996 IPO and that October hit an all-time high of $8.25. It closed
Wednesday at 53 1/8 cents, up 18 3/4 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the promised $6 million investment, which is enough to
keep Harvest qualified as a Nasdaq stock, the company still could
be delisted, though the pending merger, cash infusion and growth
plans outweigh the negatives, said Culp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tanner's credibility is pretty substantial,'' Culp said.
``We're a healthy company, we're a growing company, and we've got
experienced, professional management.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Tanner, who appears in the company's ads and now focuses on
expansion strategy , got a $5,000 loan and maxxed out his credit
cards to open the first Tanner's location in December 1986, on
Northridge Road in Dunwoody. Until last year, the restaurants were
called Tanner's Chicken Rotisserie.
</P>
<P>
   With $17 million in annual sales, the chain now operates 11
company-owned restaurants in metro Atlanta and franchises in Macon
and Montgomery. Three more franchises _ in Albany, Paulding County
and Oxford, Ala. _ break ground this month and are expected to open
by year-end.
</P>
<P>
   The merger-related investment will fund five new Tanner's,
expected to open by February, plus 14 more locations in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a pretty aggressive plan, and this was a method of
financing it,'' said Culp, whose 28-year career in the hospitality
industry includes posts as president and chief executive of Long
John Silver's and Embassy Suites.
</P>
<P>
   At year-end 1997, there were 14 Harvest Rotisserie restaurants
in Texas, Florida, Indiana, North Carolina and California.
</P>
<P>
   But within six months, all but one had closed. That location,
which in May was converted to a new concept called Harvest Food
Court, has since been shuttered. Other concepts the company tried
to invest in didn't pan out either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get past the imagery of (Harvest) in the investment
community,'' Culp said, ``then you've got yourself a public
business that has a lot of growth potential in it and funding that
gets you through the next two years.''

IN A SEASON OF WONDER, STRAWBERRY PROVIDES YET ANOTHER HIGHLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Many of the Yankees chewed on the postgame
spread minutes after Mariano Rivera closed out the second game of a
doubleheader sweep here Tuesday night. Seated at tables in the
middle of the visitors' clubhouse, they watched televisions mounted
on the walls as a network began replaying chronological highlights
from their shocking comeback victory.
</P>
<P>
   There was Darryl Strawberry on the screen, hammering the
game-tying, pinch-hit, ninth-inning grand slam they will remember
at Old Timers' Days decades from now. ``Oooooooooh,'' the players
called in unison, reacting to the vicious contact.
</P>
<P>
   And there was Paul O'Neill, hitting a drive into the upper deck
four batters later. ``Oooooh,'' they yelled. ``No-look!'' somebody
added, referring to O'Neill's habit of dropping his sight line to
the ground after he hits a ball particularly well.
</P>
<P>
   And then came Tino Martinez, a two-run homer. ``Ohhhhhh.''
</P>
<P>
   After winning the opener against Oakland, 10-4, the Yankees
scored nine runs in the ninth inning of the second game and turned
a 5-1 deficit into a 10-5 victory, their 80th victory in 108 games.
Two thirds of the way into their season, what seemed absurd three
months ago now seems possible: The Yankees are on a pace to win 120
games, which would shatter existing American League and major
league records. They've made the unimaginable routine.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the nine-run rally, the Yankees assumed the lead
when Derek Jeter, running hard to first on a groundout,
accidentally kneed Oakland first baseman Jason Giambi in the head,
causing a concussion. As Giambi slumped to the ground, the ball
stored in his glove, Chuck Knoblauch sprinted home from second base
with the pivotal run.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, after all the runs and home runs, Manager Joe Torre
appeared stunned. All along he thought this team would be great,
and he has believed in the players and respected their focused
approach to playing the game. But nobody envisions an 80-28 record.
Nobody envisions a season of 120 victories. ``They refuse to accept
the fact they might lose,'' said Torre.
</P>
<P>
   Between games of the doubleheader, Torre, for the first time,
compared his team with another club ranked among the greatest in
history, the 1976 Cincinnati Reds. ``And we have better pitching,''
Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   David Cone later weighed Torre's reference, and the majesty of
the Reds. They had four or five Hall of Fame caliber-players, Cone
said, like Johnny Bench, Joe Morgan, Pete Rose, Tony Perez and Dave
Concepcion. ``We don't really have anybody like that,'' Cone said.
``We don't have any sure-fire Hall of Famers.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused, the silence adding emphasis: ``We do have a hell of a
team.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kenny Rogers, a Yankee in 1996 and 1997, agreed. ``They are by
far the best team I will ever face,'' said the Oakland left-hander,
who left in the ninth inning of game two with a 5-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Said Bill Taylor, who allowed Strawberry's game-tying grand
slam: ``They're the best team in baseball. Ask anyone on the street
and they'll tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   By the ninth inning, most of the fans remaining in the Oakland
Coliseum were of Yankees persuasion; it was if they expected the
Yankees to come back and win.
</P>
<P>
   After Martinez singled to lead off the ninth, Tim Raines
singled, and Taylor relieved Rogers. Torre's mind was whirling: If
one more guy reached base and gave the Yankees a chance to tie,
Strawberry would pinch-hit.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Curtis ripped a hard grounder toward third, a would-be
double-play ball, and it went through the legs of Mike Blowers for
an error. Bases loaded, nobody out, and Strawberry, who had homered
in the first game, had bat in hand and was walking to the plate,
pinch-hitting for Joe Girardi.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees fans howled and roared, thinking home run. His
teammates were thinking home run. Everyone in the park, it seemed,
was thinking home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah,'' Knoblauch said later. ``You've got Darryl up there
and you're down four runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone turned to David Wells on the bench and remarked how crazy
the fans would go if Strawberry hit a grand slam. Jeter yelled
encouragement. Strawberry took a slider for a strike to run the
count to two balls and two strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor tried a fastball to the outside corner, Strawberry fouled
it down the left field line and Torre was encouraged. His swing is
right, the manager thought, he's not trying to pull the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, twisting his front foot underneath 78 inches of
height and 215 pounds, cocked his bat. Taylor threw a fastball to
the outside corner.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry's ungraceful arrogance of his days with the Mets has
been stripped away by his life experience, the loss of his fortune,
his alcohol abuse and recovery. He is 36 years old, limping on a
knee he believes is arthritic. But at the core of Strawberry, this
has never changed: He loves to play baseball, he loves to hit a
baseball, he knows he can hit a baseball, and he seemed quite
certain he was going to hit the baseball a long way when he stepped
in to bat against Taylor. He was correct.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding first base and seeing the ball disappear over the
center field wall, Strawberry, a self-trained stoic now, could no
longer mute his emotion, and he grinned broadly. He had hit a
ninth-inning grand slam, like so many ballplayers of so many
dimensions have imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Ejected from his dugout seat by the violent sound of
Strawberry's bat redirecting Taylor's fastball, Jeter began
screaming, ``He got it! It's gone!''
</P>
<P>
   The instinct, several players said, was to run to home plate and
high-five Strawberry and pound his head and hug him. The raw
emotion of it all, Girardi mused later, almost felt like high
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of excitement this team feels day in and day
out,'' he said. ``And we're pretty lucky.''

ANGLICAN BISHOPS ENDORSE CONSERVATIVE RESOLUTION ON GAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANTERBURY, England _ The world's Anglican bishops voted
overwhelmingly Wednesday to endorse a resolution declaring
homosexual activity to be ``incompatible with Scripture'' and
advising against the ordination of homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, adopted by a vote of 526-70, represented a
victory for an international group of conservative bishops,
particularly those from the fast-growing Anglican churches in
Africa and Asia. The resolution was passed at the Lambeth
Conference, the once-a-decade gathering of the leaders of Anglican
churches representing 73 million Anglicans in 160 nations.
</P>
<P>
   In their resolution, the leaders of the Anglican Communion said
they believed marriage was a lifelong union of a man and a woman
and opposed priests' blessing of same-sex unions. But they also
said that Anglican leaders wanted to assure homosexuals ``that they
are loved by God.'' The resolution also condemned an ``irrational
fear'' of homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of the vote shows that the leadership of the
Anglican Communion stands to the right of the American branch, the
2.4-million-member Episcopal Church, on issues relating to
homsexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Although the resolution is non-binding, it lends support to
conservative Episcopal bishops, who have failed for a decade to
block their more liberal colleagues from ordaining gay men and
lesbians. Such ordinations have taken place in dioceses like
Newark, N.J., where the Rt. Rev. John Spong is bishop.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, ruling in the case of a retired bishop, the Rt.
Rev. Walter Righter, who had been charged with heresy by several
other bishops for having ordained a gay man as a deacon, a church
court deeply distressed conservative bishops by declaring that the
Episcopal Church lacked a core doctrine against such ordinations.
In recent years, too, an unknown number of Episcopal priests have
quietly blessed same-sex unions, as have some other Protestant
ministers and liberal rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop James Stanton of Dallas, who was among the bishops who
brought the charges against Righter, hailed the resolution
Wednesday as a ``victory for the Gospel.'' He added that in the
United States, ``it will have a strengthening effect on the
faithful.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Rt. Rev. Catherine Roskam, an assistant bishop in the
Diocese of New York, said she would ignore the resolution. ``I'm
not taking the language of condemnation back to my constituency,''
she said. ``It has rendered itself irrelevant to my work as a
bishop.''
</P>
<P>
   Like all statements of this conference, the resolution is not
binding on the Episcopal Church or any of the other 37 church
provinces of the Anglican Communion. But it carries weight as an
expression of Anglican leaders worldwide, one that will endure at
least until the next conference.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is unusual, too, in that it may represent the first time such
an international religious body has offered its opinion on
homosexuality after such an open debate. And it comes at a time
when a divisive debate over homosexuality is intensifying in
American religious and political circles.
</P>
<P>
   The Anglicans' conference is being held at the University of
Kent, just outside the historic cathedral city of Canterbury. The
Archbishop of Canterbury is the spiritual leader of the Church of
England, to which all Anglican churches trace their roots.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev.
George Carey, called for the resolution's supporters and opponents
to respect each other. He also said the resolution represented his
views of Anglican tradition, which he said allowed ``no room'' for
sexual activity outside marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution originated with a committee of more than 50
bishops who have been studying broad issues relating to sexuality.
They began work two weeks ago amid bitter internal debate but were
able to produce a resolution considered acceptable to many liberal
bishops.
</P>
<P>
   While upholding ``faithfulness in marriage between a man and a
woman in lifelong union,'' the resolution, as originally worded,
condemned homophobia but not homosexuality, and said homosexuals
needed the church's pastoral care and moral direction.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Roskam said she decided to vote against it after
Archbishop Donald Mtetemela of Tanzania amended it to state that
``homosexual practice is incompatible with Scripture.''
</P>
<P>
   Another African prelate, Bishop Samson Muraluda of Kenya,
amended it again to remove the reference to homophobia. He
successfully asked the conference to insert a phrase condemning
``irrational fear of homosexuals,'' a change he said would prevent
people from using ``a bashing word'' against critics of homosexual
activity.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing an appeal from Bishop David Crawley of Kootenay,
British Columbia, the conference softened the resolution's language
slightly by adopting another amendment calling on Anglicans to
``listen to the experience of homosexual people.''
</P>
<P>
   Of long-term importance to the Anglican Communion, the
resolution signals the rise in influence of bishops from Africa and
Asia, where churches have grown exponentially during the last
decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spoke for the truth,'' said Bishop Henry Orombi of Uganda.
``We are quoting what is in the Scriptures. Don't you forget that
the church in America and the church in England took us the
Scriptures, and we are not reading anything different.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bishop Richard Holloway of Edinburgh, head of the Scottish
Episcopal Church, said conservatives broke a tacit compromise with
liberals by introducing tough language.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Spong, among the most liberal bishops, expressed a
long-term optimism. ``I think the victory is: this issue is on the
front-burner of every province in the world,'' he said. ``Lambeth
is where the Episcopal Church was 20 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   At the conference, which began July 18, many African and Asian
bishops have shown themselves to be deeply concerned with issues of
poverty among developing nations and of environmental degradation.
They have also taken positions on sexual issues that have made
allies of the more conservative bishops in England, Australia and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   During the debate, several African and Asian bishops spoke of
needing a clear statement against homosexuality if they were to
continue effective evangelical work in their socially conservative
societies.

COMMENTARY: THE DAMAGE IS DONE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   We have to wait now for the farce to run its course.
</P>
<P>
   The voters have come to expect so little of Bill Clinton that
they are willing to let him off the hook if he will only make a
hypocritical little speech about his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky. (``I'm sorry. I lied to protect my family,'' etc., etc.)
</P>
<P>
   But if he refuses, and if he sticks to his story before the
grand jury, and if DNA tests link him sexually to Ms. Lewinsky
despite his adamant denials (``I did not have sexual relations with
that woman'') _ if all of that happens, well, the voters will
probably let him off the hook anyway.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, unless somebody comes up with an X-rated video
of the president and his intern cavorting in the Rose Garden, you
can forget about impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But the damage is done. The nation handed its highest office to
a man who embodies the narcissistic extremes of the baby-boomer
generation. It's all about Bill. And like everyone else who has had
a relationship with this irresponsible and self-absorbed individual
_ his wife, his friends, his loyal aides, his party _ the nation is
paying the price.
</P>
<P>
   There are important issues waiting to be dealt with _ an
economic crisis in Asia, the extraordinary gap between America's
haves and have-nots, the future of Social Security, campaign
finance reform, education, health care, race relations and a
congressional election in November. But there is no leadership
coming from Clinton. He's worried about his grand jury testimony
and a devilish stain on a blue dress.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton presidency is like a car disabled on the side of the
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half the White House staff is distracted by this,'' said Sen.
Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. Referring to pending legislative matters,
Leahy said, ``The people we need the most are constantly preparing
for grand jury testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton was never about dignity or integrity or respect for
others, qualities that should be prerequisites for the presidency.
He raised hopes with his style and his rhetoric, but it turned out
there was very little that was authentic about the man. His
contempt for the truth is legendary. His idea of ethical behavior
is to operate as close as possible to the borders of corruption.
His treatment of women, as the world knows, seemed at times both
compulsive and atrocious, and became a source of profound
embarrassment to the feminists who supported him so strongly.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is nearly 52, Bill Clinton seems the perpetual
adolescent, forever calling on aides and friends to clean up the
messes he is forever getting himself into. Several associates,
enmeshed in his scandals, have gone broke from the legal bills that
resulted. Who can forget the terrified expression on the face of
the president's personal secretary, Betty Currie, as she made her
way to her first grand jury appearance?
</P>
<P>
   The use of Mrs. Currie as a go-between is instructive. It was
another example of Clinton's penchant for using people, for seeing
human beings as things, as tools or toys to serve his outsized
needs. A survey of the consequences of being close to Clinton would
be chilling. The price of being in this president's orbit can be
fearfully high.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton was at all remorseful about any of this, you'd never
know it. Last week he was out in the Hamptons, raising money and
hanging with the movie stars.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that Bill Clinton's enemies have not behaved
atrociously themselves. The extreme right wing of the Republican
Party would be happy to impeach the president for any reason at
all, for having impure thoughts or daring to breathe. And Kenneth
Starr, if he could get away with it, would very likely do its
bidding. But it's Clinton's own behavior and lack of judgment that
has so frequently betrayed and undermined his supporters, and
provided his enemies with the opportunities and the ammunition to
attack.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson, of course, is that character does matter. The voters
will probably remember that the next time around. In the meantime,
Clinton may or may not be contemplating a mea culpa. It doesn't
matter. It wouldn't be any more sincere than anything else he has
said. If he had any sense of dignity or personal responsibility,
he'd be working on his resignation.

TEXAS CONTRIBUTOR URGES INQUIRY THAT COULD EMBARRASS DeLAY 
 
By CRAGG HINES 
and BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An east Texas plastics executive, who with his
company has been fined $400,000 for campaign finance violations, is
stirring the ashes of his case in hopes that new sparks may burn
some politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Cloeren Jr. of Orange said Wednesday he has asked the
Federal Election Commission to launch an investigation aimed at
Republican House candidate Brian Babin but could embarrass House
Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Cloeren and his attorneys also are to meet Thursday in Houston
to outline their allegations to Democratic staff members of the
GOP-run House committee that has been investigating 1996 election
financing and has focused on the Clinton-Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Cloeren, who described himself as ``a political novice'' not
involved in campaigns before Babin's 1996 effort, is irked that the
U.S. attorney in Beaumont has said he is not pursuing a case
against Babin.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you kill a snake, you don't cut the tail off, you cut the
head off,'' Cloeren said.
</P>
<P>
   Cloeren said DeLay was present at an August 1996 luncheon in
Orange that was the genesis for $17,000 in contributions from
Cloeren that apparently were funneled through political
organizations and other campaigns back to help Babin.
</P>
<P>
   Babin, a Woodville dentist, lost the 1996 race in the 2nd
Congressional District in east Texas to Democrat Jim Turner and is
running against Turner again in the November election.
</P>
<P>
   Cloeren's complaint alleges that Babin ``knowingly and
willfully'' led the effort to violate federal campaign finance laws
by soliciting and using contributions whose original source was
then hidden.
</P>
<P>
   Cloeren and Cloeren Inc., an international plastics fabrication
company, were each fined $200,000 in June for coercing about 20 of
his employes and their relatives to give $37,000 to the 1996 Babin
campaign and then reimbursing the workers.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, an individual is limited to a contribution of
$1,000 to a candidate for each election, and third-party
reimbursement schemes are illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Jon-Marc McDonald, a Babin campaign spokesman, said Cloeren's
accusations were baseless.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign was not aware these illegal contributions were
taking place,'' McDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Lincenberg of Los Angeles, one of Cloeren's attorneys, said
DeLay's involvement was ``almost an aside.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay denies any wrongdoing, said spokesman Michael Scanlon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's absolutely no substance to it, and there's no
corroboration,'' Scanlon said.
</P>
<P>
   Cloeren's complaint alleges that at the August 1996 lunch DeLay
told him additional funds could be ``funneled'' through other
political committees and other congressional campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Cloeren said Wednesday his conversation with DeLay about further
contributions to Babin was brief and not specific.
</P>
<P>
   ``My discussion with DeLay on this, over lunch, lasted two or
three minutes,'' Cloeren said. ``It was not like we spent a lunch
hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like (DeLay) was saying, `Hey, you were up against
the wall (having given the maximum contribution), but we've got a
different way to do this and here's the way you do it.' It was more
a statement to the effect of Babin being outspent by his
opponent,'' Cloeren said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think DeLay is the catalyst in this thing,'' Cloeren
said. ``At the same time, I don't think he was a guy standing on
the sideline either.''
</P>
<P>
   Cloeren said one of the people who followed up with him on how
additional money could be contributed was Robert Mills, who was
DeLay's 1996 campaign manager and attended the lunch in Orange.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all nonsense,'' said Mills, now a political consultant
in Washington. ``I never did anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Contribution funneling and conduit operations, especially in
which funds appear to be earmarked for particular candidates, are a
murky issue, campaign finance specialists said.
</P>
<P>
   Cloeren's company paid for an aircraft to fly DeLay and Mills to
and from Orange for the August 1996 lunch, and after questions were
raised about it recently, Babin last week sent Cloeren's firm a
personal check for $1,320 to cover the cost of the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Cloeren's complaint, which the FEC received Wednesday, could
become part of what is understood to be an ongoing commission
inquiry into contribution pass-throughs.
</P>
<P>
   If handled as a separate complaint, Cloeren's filing would
likely have to get in line behind an FEC backlog of pending
investigations, although Babin could have to make an initial formal
response before the November election.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, Babin's opponent and a member of the House oversight
committee, said Cloeren's allegations should be of interest to the
panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``These illegal conduit payment are exactly what the committee
has been looking into for a year and a half,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   Cloeren's $17,000 in contributions at issue were: $10,000 sent
to the Citizens for Reform Committee of Triad Management Services
Inc., which was used to finance ``issue ads'' aimed against Turner,
and $5,000 to Citizens United Political Victory Fund and $1,000
each to the campaigns of Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., and Tennessee
congressional candidate Steve Gill.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens United and supporters of Thurmond and Gill immediately
sent contributions of the same amounts to Babin's campaign, the
complaint says.
</P>
<P>
   Cloeren concedes his guilt in getting employees to contribute
and then reimbursing them but believes the prosecution should not
have been limited to him. In addition to the fine, Cloeren was
sentenced to two years probation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that the fines ... were somewhat steep but recognize
that I did wrong, and that's the price you've got to pay,'' Cloeren
said. ``I feel more disheartened, if you will, that according to
the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Texas there's no
investigation going on toward Babin. ... I feel that this ran
deeper and broader and that there were others who were much more
accountable and egregious in the act than was I.''
</P>
<P>
   Cloeren's complaint said Babin ``has falsely denied his
misconduct in an effort to shirk responsibility and portray himself
in a false light to the voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Cloeren's filing said that at the FBI's request he tape recorded
a phone conversation with Babin in which the employee contributions
were discussed and one with Babin strategist Walter Whetsell in
which ``Whetsell confirmed Babin's knowledge of the conduit
contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan Woodford, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Mike Bradford in
Beaumont, pointed to Bradford's earlier statements that Babin was
not a target in the Cloeren investigation and said they were
``still operative.''

LESLIE WORTHINGTON, 96, FORMER U.S. STEEL CORP PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Wis.)   (bl)  
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leslie B. Worthington, who as president of U.S. Steel Corp.
guided the company out of a prolonged steelworkers' strike and into
a confrontation with President John F. Kennedy over the industry's
's attempt to raise steel prices, died Aug. 3 at his home in
Ligonier, Pa. He was 96.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a coal miner who came to the United States from
England with his family in 1907, Worthington was elected the eighth
president of the country's largest steel manufacturer on Nov. 10,
1959.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, U.S. Steel was four months into a six-month strike
by steelworkers, then the longest strike in the industry's history.
The labor dispute was settled in January 1960 after intervention by
Vice President Richard Nixon and Labor Secretary James Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Even for someone who had spent his entire career in the steel
industry, Worthington's move to the top ranks of corporate America
came earlier than expected. His predecessor, Walter Mumford, had
been president of U.S. Steel for only a few months in 1959 when he
accidentally inflicted a knife wound on himself. A day after
undergoing surgery to repair the wound, Mumford suffered a stroke.
He died shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Worthington's appointment, observers on Wall
Street expected him to fight a pitched battle against the low-cost
imported steel that was dogging the industry. Like the company
founder Charles M. Schwab, Worthington's background was in sales,
rather than manufacturing. He joined Carnegie-Illinois Steel Corp.
as a sales apprentice in 1923 after graduation from the University
of Illinois, and worked his way up through the marketing ranks,
heading the company's sales offices in St. Paul, Minn.; Detroit and
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, Worthington moved to U.S. Steel Supply Corp. as a vice
president, becoming president in 1946, a post he held for 11 years.
In 1957, he was named president of the company's big
Columbia-Geneva Steel division in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   After taking over as president and a director of the parent
company in 1959, Worthington remained second-in-command to U.S.
Steel chairman Roger Blough. But as head of the company's executive
committee, Worthington was most often the company's public face.
</P>
<P>
   As such, he used the wage increases granted to steelworkers in
1960 and again in 1962 as an opportunity to engage in a battle of
wills with the Kennedy administration, which had chastised the
steel industry for failing to make enough investments in new plants
and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Worthington countered by arguing that the industry's real
problems were caused by cheaper imports, made overseas by workers
who earned less than one-third the $32 a day paid to American
steelworkers, and from domestic manufacturers of rival materials,
like aluminum and plastics.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation reached a culmination in April 1962, when U.S.
Steel announced its first price increase in four years, raising the
price of steel mill products by $6 a ton, to $176.
</P>
<P>
   The move shocked and enraged Kennedy, who attacked the increase
as ``a chilling and irresponsible defiance of the nation's
interest'' and ordered a federal grand jury investigation of U.S.
Steel under the Sherman Antitrust Act.
</P>
<P>
   After three days of rhetoric and negotiation, which included a
move by the Defense Department, the biggest steel buyer in the
nation, to divert purchases to other manufacturers, U.S. Steel
followed the lead of several smaller steel makers in rescinding the
price increase.
</P>
<P>
   But that was not the end of the acrimony. Two weeks later, U.S.
Steel and Bethlehem Steel Co. were indicted on charges of violating
federal antitrust laws. Federal officials said the indictment had
nothing to do with the aborted price increase, but again in
September 1962, U.S. Steel was one of 15 companies named in a
federal indictment for conspiracy to fix prices of plastic hose and
pipe.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1963, U.S. Steel and the other steel companies finally
pushed through ``selected price adjustments'' that averaged $4.85 a
ton. This time, Kennedy said, the price increase was ``not
incompatible with a framework of general stability and steel price
stability.'' And when the big steel companies again raised prices
in August 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson made nary a protest.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, one year before his retirement, Worthington began to
push U.S. Steel into more vigorous competition in the chemicals
industry, consolidating its packaging and plastics operations into
a new division, USS Chemicals. But by and large, the days of Big
Steel had passed.
</P>
<P>
   Worthington is survived by his second wife, Bernice Hubbard
Worthington; two sons, John Rice Worthington of Washington and Paul
Leslie Worthington of Milwaukee; five grandchildren, and seven
great-grandchildren. His first wife, Dorothy Helen Rice
Worthington, died in 1968.

   ORAHOVAC, Yugoslavia _ In a remote onion field on a hill
overlooking this city Wednesday, a thin blond woman knelt at a
6-foot-long mound of earth, then laid her cheek on the grave. With
tears welling, she began to stroke the earth where it covered the
dead person's chest and said, ``He is my brother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was killed here, but six others were executed on the other
side of the field, and when they came to get the bodies and hide
them they did not see my brother,'' she said. ``My uncle buried him
where we found him.'' She explained that the family was afraid to
give him a proper burial because they did not want to attract the
attention of the Serbian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, her family and many other ethnic Albanians returning
to Kosovo province after having fled government forces are finding
that family members and friends are missing. Although many of those
considered missing may still be hiding in the mountains, those who
have returned say they fear that the others have been arrested or
even killed.
</P>
<P>
   In the onion field there were six spots that bore evidence of
having held decomposing bodies, but who was in the graves, how they
died and where the bodies were taken remain a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   On a hill outside the city, on a garbage dump across from the
cemetery, there are crude markers for what appear to be about 40
new graves. A large mechanical back-hoe stands at the cemetery on a
field of excavated earth that could cover other bodies as well as
garbage. Serbian authorities said the graves held bodies, most of
them unidentified, that were found after they recaptured the city
from ethnic Albanian rebels.

   Another woman in Orahovac said her husband had been killed by
the Serbs and was buried in a mass grave. The woman, like every
ethnic Albanian interviewed, refused to give her name, citing fear
of the Serbian authorities. She said, ``He was taken from our home
while I was gone. We have three children. Everyone knows what
happened to him, many people saw it. His body was on one of those
tractor wagons they took away.''
</P>
<P>
   However sincere the woman's belief may be that her husband was
murdered and secretly buried, when pressed she could not remember
anyone who saw his death or saw a wagon filled with bodies.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, not one of her 16 neighbors and relatives, all
of whom seemed certain that a missing family member had been
murdered, had spoken with anyone who saw the killing or the body.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians, their terror fueled by
their conviction that the government soldiers are killing
civilians, are still scattered in forests, hiding. Aid
organizations say the challenge of getting food, water and medical
supplies to the refugees is so great they fear many may die from
something as simple as dehydration or from an epidemic brought on
by unsanitary conditions. Even knowing these dangers, many refugees
say they will not return to their homes as long as government
forces control the area.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For those who do come home, the atmosphere in the city is thick
with fear. The Serbian forces' reputation for wanton brutality is
being reinforced these days by a wave of looting and house-burning
in the areas they have retaken from the rebels. Serbian authorities
say they want ethnic Albanians to feel free to return home, but
tough-looking police officers in civilian clothes lurk on corners
to harass citizens, adding to their terror.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came back, but we are now prisoners in our homes because if
we go out they will beat us or kill us,'' said a man hiding in a
small room off a courtyard behind a tiny door on a back street. ``I
came back because they said we would be safe and I brought all my
family, 22 people. But the police took me to the station and from
seven in the morning until 11, every officer there had a turn at
beating me.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Orahovac, the number of looted homes and shops has grown
dramatically in the 16 days that Serbian police have had control.
New fires sprouted up hourly Wednesday in the surrounding villages,
burning homes to which ethnic Albanians will not be returning.
</P>
<P>
   In the town of Malisevo, which was a rebel headquarters until it
was captured by government forces July 28, much of the central area
is burned and every shop still standing appears to have been
looted. In the mountains around Malisevo, ethnic Albanians who fled
before the town fell can see the smoke from their burning homes.
</P>
<P>
   The new areas under government control are marked as much by
house fires and looted homes as they are by the slouching, hostile
Serbian police officers on patrol. In a small village where seven
homes were burning or in cinders, a police officer opened fire on,
but missed hitting, a journalist examining a looted house.
</P>
<P>
   A fire truck, with soldiers riding on top, rolled through the
area past burning homes, carrying a load of watermelons.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ While professional stock traders vacillated sharply
Wednesday between certainty that the worst was over and fear that
more declines remain ahead, mutual fund investors, who have
provided crucial fuel to the market's advance in recent years,
remained steadfast, if cautious.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the day was volatile, with prices swinging wildly
between gains and losses but finishing generally higher. The Dow
Jones industrial average gained 59.47 points, or 0.7 percent, to
8,546.78. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was the
second-heaviest ever after the market's crash on Oct. 19, 1987,
with 859.21 million shares changing hands.
</P>
<P>
   Midsized and small stocks continued to suffer. The Nasdaq
composite index eeked out a gain of 2.56 to 1,788.20, but the
Russell 2000 index, a small-cap benchmark, fell 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the credit for Wednesday's gains might go to Abby Joseph
Cohen, Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co.'s widely followed investment strategist,
who weighed in from her vacation in Israel calling the recent
decline an ``overreaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cohen's comments echoed through lower Manhattan's financial
district Wednesday, drawing sighs of relief, if not cheers, even
from traders at rival firms. On Salomon Smith Barney's giant
trading floor, traders repeated Ms. Cohen's remark that ``stocks
are trading at undervalued levels'' throughout the morning.
</P>
<P>
   As on Tuesday, much of the move in the major market averages
came in the last half hour of trading, when the Dow industrials
bounced from a loss of 125 points to a gain of 59 points. Earlier,
the industrial average at one point was up more than 87 points.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, the stock market looked as if Sisyphus were
in charge. Bouts of selling from professional computer-driven
investment programs would send the market averages plunging.
Slower, steadier gains followed, only to be overtaken by rapid
declines.
</P>
<P>
   The one clear, unwavering factor in the recent activity has been
the bullish stance of Ms. Cohen. Wednesday she said that she
continued to believe that earnings, Asian developments and the
outlook for inflation and interest rates all support ``a favorable
case for equity ownership.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Ms. Cohen said that ``the recent weakness in
stock prices has not been accompanied by a proportionate
fundamental weakness.'' In addition, she said, ``the latest news on
the economy and corporate performance has been better than is
commonly perceived.''
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, Ms. Cohen said, she expects the Dow industrials will
``easily surpass'' the 9,300 level by the end of the year. ``We
look at a somewhat longer time horizon. Over the longer term, the
fundamentals still look quite favorable,'' she said, despite any
``short-term noise.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cohen pointed out that although overall earnings for the
companies in the S&AMP;P 500 stock index did not grow from the
year-earlier period, operating profits _ measured before special
charges _ rose by 5.7 percent in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But even that is less than some investors would like to see.
``At the beginning of the year, people were expecting earnings to
grow 14 percent,'' said Robert C. Doll Jr., manager of the
Oppenheimer Growth fund, a $2.2 billion mutual fund. ``While 5.7
percent is not so awful on an absolute basis, relative to the 14
percent people were expecting, it's a horrible shortfall.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Doll has been selling stocks this week _ for more than
a year, he has kept more than one-third of his fund's assets in
cash, because he cannot justify buying when most price/earnings
multiples are so high.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two weeks, however, Doll said, he has been
``nibbling away,'' buying certain stocks as prices declined and
reducing his cash position to 36 percent of assets from 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations, too, seem to see some value in the lower stock
prices produced by the recent market decline. At least 15 companies
announced programs this week to repurchase their own stock, said
Richard Peterson, an analyst at Securities Data Co., following
similar announcements from 49 companies, for repurchases of $10
billion in stock, last week. Last week's figures were the highest
this year, Peterson said, but they are likely to eclipsed by this
week's activity.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund investors did not appear to be too troubled by the
market's last two days. Some fund companies, like Fidelity
Investments, the country's largest, reported that investors moved
relatively small amounts of money from stocks into bond and money
market funds. Others, however, like the Vanguard Group, said that
optimistic investors put as much money into stock funds as
pessimistic investors pulled out.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A big reason investors are not likely to be much worried is that
they generally still have hefty profits in their mutual fund
accounts. Since the beginning of 1995, investors have poured nearly
$600 billion into mutual funds that invest primarily in American
stocks and they have aggregate profits totaling 46 percent, based
on a weighted-average calculation of the prices at which that money
flowed into mutual funds _ 739 on the S&AMP;P 500 index _ and where it
is now, 1,081.43.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly it will take more than a 3 percent decline in prices, as
the market suffered Tuesday, or more than the 10 percent decline
from its peak that the S&AMP;P 500 hit at its low Wednesday, to shake
investors' faith. Wednesday the index rose 9.31, for a 0.87 percent
gain.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign equity markets generally declined on Wednesday,
following Tuesday's sharp decline on Wall Street. European stock
indexes fell between 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent, while Asian
markets generally declined by 1.5 percent. Japan's Nikkei index
fell less sharply, however, on Tuesday, declining by 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Most professional investors expect the volatility to continue,
however. ``Unfortunately, too many people have gotten used to
relatively low volatility and one direction of stock movement,
which is up,'' said Robert Bissell, president and chief investment
officer at Wells Capital Management, a unit of Wells Fargo &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest remaining question for investors around the world is
whether the weight of the bull market might be getting too heavy
for Abby Cohen to keep pushing up the hill.

PIONEER GROUP LOSSES HIGHER THAN EXPECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Stung by a high-level embezzlement scandal at its small
bank in Moscow, The Pioneer Group Inc. Wednesday reported
higher-than-expected losses of $12.1 million for the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The asset management company's disclosure of financial misdeeds
at its Pioneer Bank unit has shocked company executives but not
emerging market observors, to whom misdoings in Russia's Wild West
atmosphere are common.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Pioneer, one of the nation's most aggressive
emerging market investors, said a pending sale of 35 percent of the
Moscow bank to an Estonian financial institution had been scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer reported losses in the second quarter through June 30 of
$0.48 per diluted share, compared with net income of $5 million, or
$0.19 a share, a year ago. It had earlier estimated second quarter
losses at $10 million, or $0.40 a share.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time ever, the publicly-traded company cancelled
its quarterly $0.10 dividend.
</P>
<P>
   The Moscow bank, of which Pioneer owns nearly 60 percent, lost
$5.9 million in the just-ended period. It had suspended operations
and its Russian chairman had resigned. Moscow authorities and the
Russian Central Bank are investigating.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal may cast a cloud over Russia's troubled financial
markets, and is likely to frighten skittish foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer's main business is US mutual funds, for which it saw
record sales in the second quarter of $1.1 billion, a rise of 70
percent on a year ago. But the increase was overshadowed by the
company's beleagured emerging market operations.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Pioneer Bank had been trying to make money in the
depressed Russian stock market by funneling deposits through a
byzantine string of sham Russian firms to speculate in shares. The
scams, which were carried out by the bank's most senior Russian
executives, were recorded as legitimate loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made the decision that we do not want to be in the
banking business in Moscow,'' said William H. Keogh, Pioneer's
chief financial officer. Keogh, 61, said he would retire next
April. He declined to state the amount of total deposits at the
bank, which is small even by Russian standards.
</P>
<P>
   Keogh, who said Pioneer first caught wind of the scam in
mid-May, said reserves were large enough to liquidate the bank but
said depositors were unlikely to see their money again.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's weak legal environment offers foreign investors and
domestic depositors alike little protection. Russians have watched
inflation, bank collapses, and currency revaluations wipe out their
savings several times in recent decades, and generally mistrust
banks. Securities market fraud, ranging from secret share issues to
classic pyramid schemes, are not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   Unusual for a mutual fund firm, Pioneer also has a gold mine in
Africa and timber operations in Siberia, as well as mutual funds
designed for investors in Asia, Central and Eastern Europe, and
India, among other places.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer's Moscow-based bank is part of the company's Russian
financial services group, which includes a brokerage, real-estate
unit, and venture capital operations. Altogether those units lost
$6.8 million in the second quarter, compared with net income of
$0.8 million in the same period a year ago. The recent figures
includes the Moscow bank losses.
</P>
<P>
   Once cash cows for Pioneer, which has total assets under
management of $23 billion, the far-flung ventures have lately been
leeches on earnings. The company's Forest-Starma timber operation
lost $8.5 million last quarter due to very low world timber prices,
while its Teberebie Goldfields mine, in Ghana, lost $5.7 million on
depressed world gold markets and production glitches. The head of
the gold venture, Lucien Girard, retired last month, and was
replaced by Roger K. Leonard, the mine's chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic mutual fund sales accounted for half of Pioneer's $343
million in revenues last year. Russian financial services made up
the next largest chunk, or 16 percent. Despite its setbacks in
Russia, Keogh said the company remained committed to doing business
in the country. Pioneer, he said, expected to turn a profit in the
second half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   With the Russian stock market down 64 percent since so far this
year, Pioneer may be unlikely to reap gains in the near future from
its Russian securities operations.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer's Moscow bank had revenues of $12.3 million in 1997
after $15 million in 1996. But things have since changed. The bank,
like most of its Russian counterparts, made most of its money
trading Russian GKO Treasury bills, whose yields in recent years
exceeded 220 percent. Returns are now a fraction of that level, and
the bank exited the business last year.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer reported its second quarter results after the market
closed. Its stock price rose 1/4 to close at 24 1/2 Wednesday on
the New York Stock Exchange.

GM PLANS NEW GENERATION OF MORE EFFICIENT PLANTS 
</HEADLINE>

 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. _ General Motors chairman and chief
executive John Smith said Wednesday that the world's largest
automaker would build a new generation of highly efficient assembly
plants in North America. The plants would use far less labor than
current assembly plants as outside suppliers, many of them with
nonunion workers, would do much work previously done by GM
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the new plants would be modeled mainly on GM's
efficient new operations in Brazil, and to a lesser extent on other
GM factories overseas. Those factories rely on outside suppliers to
produce large chunks of vehicles, like fully assembled dashboards,
instead of delivering lots of little parts that are bolted together
on the assembly line. That is in keeping with GM's move this week
to become a company that designs, assembles and markets cars and
trucks but makes few of the parts.
</P>
<P>
   GM's new strategy, and particularly Wednesday's plan for new
assembly plants, represents a challenge to the United Automobile
Workers union, which last week settled a strike of nearly two
months at two auto parts factories in Flint, Mich. Four out of
every five outside auto parts factories in the United States are
not unionized, so shifting work to them weakens the UAW's grip on
the industry and erodes its membership.
</P>
<P>
   UAW officials were studying Wednesday's announcement and had no
immediate reaction. But GM and the UAW have been quietly discussing
the new assembly plants for weeks and the union response in these
meetings has been mixed, UAW officials said in recent interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The union leaders are pleased that GM is interested in investing
at all in the United States instead of overseas, but deeply
troubled by the kinds of factories that GM plans to build. The new
factories could use half as many workers as the current factories.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare speech and news conference in Traverse City, the
usually reclusive Smith presented his plans for new assembly plants
for the first time, part of a broad vision to change GM, the
world's largest company in terms of sales and share of global
economic output.
</P>
<P>
   GM announced Monday that it would turn its vast auto parts
subsidiary into an independent company, with stock in the
subsidiary, Delphi Automotive Systems, to be distributed next year
to GM investors. GM announced Tuesday that it would combine the
corporate staffs of Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, Oldsmobile and
Pontiac into a single marketing organization that might be able to
sell cars more effectively, although the names on dealerships and
car models would not change.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said this week's moves had long been planned and that the
strike had only delayed them a little. But Smith has also been
under enormous pressure from Wall Street to take decisive action to
make GM more competitive.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some Wall Street analysts even asked publicly during the strike
whether Smith was the right person to lead GM, suggesting that
while he had led the company back from the brink of bankruptcy
after taking over in 1992, he had taken few bold moves since then
and had not laid out a vision for the company's direction.
</P>
<P>
   Many institutional investors had expected GM to inflict a
crushing blow to the UAW at the end of a strike that cost the
company $3 billion in after-tax earnings, and have pushed down the
company's stock in response to the very limited settlement that
actually resulted.
</P>
<P>
   Smith discussed his plans for the company in Traverse City at
midday and GM stock closed at $68.375, down $1.125.
</P>
<P>
   Smith refused to discuss Wednesday when or where GM would build
its new assembly plants, which would be its first in the United
States since the construction of the 7,000-employee Saturn factory
in Spring Hill, Tenn., in the 1980s. ``We are planning on building
some new assembly plants to replace and consolidate older plants,''
Smith said. ``The new plants will be lean and agile in every
respect, operating 24 hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   After describing the large role that suppliers play in Brazil,
Smith said, ``We believe that vehicle manufacturing will evolve in
this direction here in North America.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Harbour, a manufacturing consultant in Troy, Mich., said
GM would probably start by building one of the new type of assembly
plant, which could take a couple of years, and then watch how it
worked before building more.
</P>
<P>
   Next to each new assembly plant, GM plans to put a factory that
could stamp hoods and other automotive body parts from sheets of
steel, Smith said. That plan sheds new light on GM's strong stand
against the UAW during the recent strike in Flint, Mich. GM tried
unsuccessfully to stop investing in a low-productivity stamping
factory in Flint that would be a logical candidate for closure if
GM builds new stamping factories.
</P>
<P>
   In an olive branch to the powerful UAW, Smith said Wednesday
that he wanted to develop a closer relationship with union leaders
and planned to discuss how the new factories would work.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the University of Michigan's annual auto industry
conference here in this Lake Michigan resort, 200 miles northwest
of Detroit, Smith also promised repeatedly that GM would not lay
off anyone in the coming years, but would rely instead on allowing
workers to retire without replacing them.
</P>
<P>
   GM has already eliminated 125,000 hourly jobs in the United
States since 1990 by not replacing people who retire or leave for
other reasons, and thinks that it can continue reducing its work
force this way, he said, adding, ``We're not talking about layoffs
or anything like that, we're talking about working within the
window of our attrition rates.''
</P>
<P>
   With a steadily shrinking market share, GM has hired few
employees since the late 1970's and has 220,000 hourly workers left
in the United States, mostly represented by the UAW The automaker
has 600,000 employees worldwide and continues to lag rival
automakers in terms of the number of autos that each worker
produces annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do we close the productivity gap without costly work
stoppages is the clear focus in my head,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes in Flint severely hurt GM's sales in July. The
company said Wednesday that its sales of cars and light trucks
dropped 37.7 percent, as car sales plunged 45.0 percent while sales
of sport utility vehicles, pickups and vans fell 28.1 percent. GM's
overall share of the light-vehicle market decreased to 21 percent,
trailing Ford Motor Co., at 27.5 percent, for the first time since
a two-month strike in 1970 also crippled GM's production.
</P>
<P>
   GM's plans to build efficient new factories might well provoke a
flurry of offers of tax incentives and other financial assistance
from state governments, Mexico and Canada. Smith avoided saying
whether GM would put any of the new assembly plants in Mexico. But
he did say that GM was considering the construction of new plants
close to existing ones.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW's contracts with the Big Three automakers give workers
the privilege of turning down transfers to work sites more than 50
miles away, and the workers have virtually guaranteed lifetime
employment.

LEWINSKY SET TO APPEAR BEFORE GRAND JURY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Monica Lewinsky, the woman at the center of an
alleged presidential affair and cover-up, is scheduled to make her
long-awaited appearance before a federal grand jury Thursday to
talk about her relationship with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As the 25-year-old former White House intern and her legal team
met a final time with prosecutors who will lead the questioning
before grand jurors, the president visited Capitol Hill where he
was greeted warmly by House Democrats at a meeting at which the
Lewinsky investigation was not discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't come up, not even indirectly,'' said Rep. Nick
Lampson of Texas as he emerged from the president's closed-door
session with the House Democratic Caucus. Although not spoken, the
scandal was not far from the Democrats' minds. ``The silence was
deafening,'' said California Rep. Vic Fazio.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, former White House deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes
and five Secret Service employees testified before two grand juries
being used by independent counsel Kenneth Starr's prosecutors to
speed their inquiry into whether the president or any of his
associates engaged in an illegal cover-up of his alleged
extra-marital activities.
</P>
<P>
   At the federal courthouse where the grand juries meet, the U.S.
Protective Service beefed up security to deal with a larger than
usual crowd of reporters, photographers and tourists expected with
Lewinsky's appearance.
</P>
<P>
   On one of the large television trucks outside the courthouse, a
weathered sign alerts the curious: ``We're here for the Ken Starr
grand jury. Monica is not here.'' On Wednesday, the sign was
amended to read: ``But check back tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the case confirmed that Lewinsky was due to
testify Thursday but noted that the schedule of witnesses could be
changed overnight by Starr. ``There's a 99 percent chance she'll
appear,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press quoted an unnamed source saying that
Lewinsky was emotionally drained by the rehearsals for her grand
jury appearance and was torn by the prospect of providing testimony
that would conflict with Clinton's sworn statement denying they had
ever had sex.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, who last week was given immunity from prosecution by
Starr, reportedly told prosecutors that she and Clinton engaged in
sex at the White House, discussed ways to keep their relationship
secret and agreed to use the president's secretary Betty Currie as
an intermediary for returning several gifts the president gave the
former intern.
</P>
<P>
   In the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton,
both the president and Lewinsky denied under oath in January that
their relationship involved sex. Clinton has said publicly that he
never asked anyone to lie.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's testimony _ which one source said could be wrapped up
in a day, and another said would take several days _ will set the
stage for Clinton's Aug. 17 appearance before the grand jury by
closed-circuit television.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's appearance Thursday also could be put on hold if
Starr decides to focus instead on a dispute over questions his
prosecutors asked of Lanny Breuer, a White House special counsel
who helped prepare the president's response to the scandal inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The court rulings that cleared the way for Breuer to testify
before the grand jury left open the possibility that the White
House could try to block certain questioning by making additional
claims of attorney-client privilege or resurrecting its earlier
claim of executive privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Early Wednesday, Breuer and a team of White House lawyers met
behind closed doors with U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway
Johnson, who oversees the Starr grand jury. Breuer then left the
courthouse without returning to the grand jury room and without
explaining why he was not resuming his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials declined comment on the outcome of the
hearing and played down Lewinsky's impending appearance before the
grand jury. ``We have no view on it,'' said presidential spokesman
Barry Toiv.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of Starr's inquiry has quickened during the past two
weeks, and Wednesday _ the fourth anniversary of his appointment to
investigate Clinton's business dealings in Arkansas _ the
independent counsel was urged to finish his work quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Penn., wrote to Starr asking him to submit
his report to Congress as required by law ``as soon as possible''
after Clinton's testimony Aug. 17. ``I strongly believe that the
timing of your report should not depend on this year's elections,''
Specter wrote. ``This November's election should neither cause your
report to be expedited nor delayed.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Samuel Del Villar, Mexico City's Harvard-educated
district attorney, works like a man with a mission, guzzling black
coffee through 15-hour days in his crusade to suppress crime and
corruption. And there's always more to do.
</P>
<P>
   In the eight months since Mexico's City's opposition mayor
appointed him to office, he has dismissed police commanders accused
of torture, auto theft, assault, kidnapping and narcotics
trafficking. Last week, 63 detectives were dismissed after they
tested positive for drug use. Three days later, he ordered the
arrest of a prosecutor and eight subordinates after the jail-cell
rape of a teen-age prostitute who sought police protection from her
pimp.
</P>
<P>
   Along this march of dismal events, however, Del Villar had cause
to brighten one recent day when, on a visit to a downtown police
precinct, he heard a detective complain that typing routine reports
took hours on a manual typewriter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could you use some computers?'' Del Villar asked, savoring the
July 21 windfall settlement that followed his prosecution of IBM on
conspiracy charges related to a procurement contract. IBM is to pay
Mexico City $37.5 million in cash and new computers, which he says
will help to modernize the city's vast, crumbling criminal justice
bureaucracy. ``We're going to have lots of computers!'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The IBM case is the largest achievement so far for Del Villar,
whom Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas swore in last December with the
pledge ``We're going to take the city back from the criminals.''
Del Villar is under pressure to show dramatic progress before
Cardenas' expected presidential run in 2000, but he faces a
staggering challenge, not just because organized crime is so
entrenched but also because the police are discredited and he faces
daily nitpicking in a hostile press.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corruption has been Mexico's disaster, because nobody has
taken the law into account,'' said Del Villar during a breakfast of
papayas and mangos at his downtown offices. ``This is our chance to
work for the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Villar, who is 53, presides over the attorney general's
office of Mexico City, supervising the city's 3,700-officer
detective corps, known as the judicial police, and the 1,500
prosecutors, in a city of 8.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found him very bright, very interested,'' said Ray Kelly,
the former New York police commissioner, with whom Del Villar
discussed New York's efforts against police corruption during a
dinner last year at the home in New York of Victor Gotbaum, the
longtime union leader. ``He was looking at what we'd done. He
seemed familiar with the details. But obviously he has a heavy lift
ahead of him on police corruption in Mexico City.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Villar, who holds degrees from Mexican and European
universities and a doctorate in law from Harvard, has sought
criminal justice reform throughout his career. He returned from
Harvard in 1972 convinced of the need to strengthen Mexico's
Supreme Court, which has been a mere holding pen for presidential
cronies, and urged a prominent leader of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, to seek appointment as chief justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted him to be Mexico's John Marshall,'' said Del Villar,
referring to America's pioneering chief justice in the early 19th
century. But the PRI leader scoffed, he recalled. ``He said I
didn't know how things worked, that to be on the Supreme Court was
just to be in limbo.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Villar got his own chance at reform when President Miguel de
la Madrid appointed him in 1982 to head a campaign aimed at rooting
out corruption. Eventually Del Villar concluded that he lacked
presidential support and resigned, but not before arranging passage
of a law requiring competitive bidding in government procurement
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   That was the law he accused IBM executives and city officials of
violating when they arranged the 1996 purchase of a $26 million
computer system.
</P>
<P>
   His largest step toward political reform came after 1988's
presidential voting, which he denounced as fraudulent. He quit the
PRI and helped Cardenas form the Party of the Democratic
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   If the IBM case has drawn him considerable praise, previous
months were difficult. In his first week in office, he was stunned
by accusations that a top commander he had just appointed had
headed a police unit tied to the torture and murder of a prisoner.
Del Villar replaced the commander but faced weeks of attack in
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an intelligent man who has always been a crusader,''
said Denise Dresser, a political scientist. ``His main problem is
that he is not fully in control of the attorney general's office.''
</P>
<P>
   He is working to consolidate his grasp. During his tenure he has
ordered the arrest of 60 subordinates. He has outlined sweeping
plans to decentralize his agency, setting up new offices for
reporting crimes throughout the city, including some in subway
stations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He has also inaugurated programs to train thousands of police
officers and to consolidate law enforcement as a professional
career by raising salaries. A rookie detective earns $517 a month.
</P>
<P>
   These efforts keep him running. One day last week, his Chevrolet
Suburban nosed into an underground garage before 8 a.m. and minutes
later he was in his 11th-floor office, briefing a reporter over
breakfast. At 10 a.m. he was at the head of a conference table with
civic leaders, shining a laser pointer on a wall map of the city
center to outline a campaign against muggers.
</P>
<P>
   At noon, he was leading a tour of a precinct station that is a
pilot project for a plan to reorganize the way citizens report
crimes and the police book suspects, with an eye to eliminating
delays and bribery.
</P>
<P>
   At the desk of a junior prosecutor, Del Villar leafed through
files to verify that the official was keeping up with her
investigative workload. ``Remember, the eyes of our staff are on
you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He ordered the precinct's holding cells, which were originally
adjacent to desks where citizens report crimes, relocated down a
hallway after discovering that detained suspects were shouting
threats at crime victims. From behind the bars of the newly
constructed cells, a teen-age purse-snatcher whispered to him that
corrupt police were protecting his daily thievery. Del Villar
ordered an aide to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Through the afternoon there were meetings at two other precincts
and examination of the curriculum at the police academy. As the sun
set, Del Villar was back at headquarters, discussing security for
the subways and schools. During a pause, he pored over graphs that
he said showed reported crimes decreasing since he took office.
Critics dispute that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll vouch for Samuel's honesty, but it's too early to draw
judgments about crime trends,'' said Rafael Ruiz Harrell, a
criminologist at the National University.
</P>
<P>
   If there is debate over short-term trends, there is none about
the alarming surge over recent years. Reported crimes doubled in
the city in four years, from 366 daily in 1993 to 700 last year.
Some criminologists attribute this to the economic crisis and some
suggest other causes. Del Villar blames changes in the penal code
in 1993 that encouraged criminals by raising the evidentiary
threshold required for prosecutors to obtain indictments.
</P>
<P>
   He has proposed legal reforms, and two PRI senators were waiting
to discuss them. It was 9:30 p.m. when Del Villar poured another
cup of coffee and stepped into his office to greet them.

JUDGE ORDERS MINISTER TURNED OVER TO WAR CRIMES COURT 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ An elderly minister who is accused of genocide
in Rwanda and who has been living in Texas must be handed over to a
United Nations war crimes tribunal, a federal judge ruled
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge John Rainey's decision marks the latest
round in a two-year legal battle and is the first time in history
that a person arrested on U.S. soil would be handed over to a U.N.
tribunal, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Elizaphan Ntakirutimana, 74, was being held at the Webb County
Jail Wednesday after he was arrested at his son's Laredo home.
Ntakirutimana has repeatedly denied any role in the ethnic
bloodshed that occurred in the Central African nation.
</P>
<P>
   The war crimes tribunal, based in Tanzania, has accused
Ntakirutimana of leading attackers armed with machetes, grenades
and guns in a murderous April 1994 rampage that killed dozens of
people who had taken refuge in his Seventh-day Adventist Church.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Rwanda was in the throes of a bloody feud between
the country's dominant ethnic groups, the Hutus and Tutsis, strife
that killed an estimated 500,000 and sent 2 million refugees
fleeing to neighboring nations. Most of those killed, including
those in Ntakirutimana's church, were Tutsis. Ntakirutimana, a
Hutu, also is charged with being a fugitive of a foreign
government.
</P>
<P>
   He suffers from a number of health problems.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman at U.N. headquarters in New York welcomed the
court decision Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It represents a step forward in ending impunity by bringing
those responsible for tragedy to court,'' Jessica Jiji said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, who is representing
Ntakirutimana, was given 30 days to appeal the ruling. Clark could
not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Clark has questioned the legality of the war crimes tribunal and
said that Ntakirutimana was a religious man who was being framed by
tribal hatred in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   The elderly man's family has said he's being persecuted by
members of the new government in Rwanda who resented his ethnicity
and his power as a minister in the 265,000-member Seventh-day
Adventist Church in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Don DeGabrielle said Ntakirutimana would
be held until the judge orders marshals to hand the man over to the
State Department, which would transfer him to the Tanzania-based
tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as his actual guilt or innocence, that's up to the
tribunal to decide,'' DeGabrielle said.
</P>
<P>
   Ntakirutimana faces up to life in prison, if convicted.

<P>
   Rainey's 61-page ruling pushes aside a federal magistrate's
December 1997 decision that Ntakirutimana should not be turned over
to the tribunal because his arrest violated the U.S. Constitution.

LEWINSKY SET TO APPEAR BEFORE GRAND JURY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Sub for minor editing) 
 
By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Monica Lewinsky, the woman at the center of an
alleged presidential affair and cover-up, is scheduled to make her
long-awaited appearance before a federal grand jury Thursday to
talk about her relationship with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As the 25-year-old former White House intern and her legal team
met a final time with prosecutors who will lead the questioning
before grand jurors, the president visited Capitol Hill where he
was greeted warmly by House Democrats at a meeting at which the
Lewinsky investigation was not discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't come up, not even indirectly,'' said Rep. Nick
Lampson of Texas as he emerged from the president's closed-door
session with the House Democratic Caucus. Although not spoken, the
scandal was not far from the Democrats' minds. ``The silence was
deafening,'' said California Rep. Vic Fazio.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, former White House deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes
and five Secret Service employees testified before two grand juries
being used by independent counsel Kenneth Starr's prosecutors to
speed their inquiry into whether the president or any of his
associates engaged in an illegal cover-up of his alleged
extra-marital activities.
</P>
<P>
   At the federal courthouse where the grand juries meet, the U.S.
Protective Service beefed up security to deal with a larger than
usual crowd of reporters, photographers and tourists expected with
Lewinsky's appearance.
</P>
<P>
   On one of the large television trucks outside the courthouse, a
weathered sign alerts the curious: ``We're here for the Ken Starr
grand jury. Monica is not here.'' On Wednesday, the sign was
amended to read: ``But check back tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the case confirmed that Lewinsky was due to
testify Thursday but noted that the schedule of witnesses could be
changed overnight by Starr. ``There's a 99 percent chance she'll
appear,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press quoted an unnamed source saying that
Lewinsky was emotionally drained by the rehearsals for her grand
jury appearance and was torn by the prospect of providing testimony
that would conflict with Clinton's sworn statement denying they had
ever had sex.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, who last week was given immunity from prosecution by
Starr, reportedly told prosecutors that she and Clinton engaged in
sex at the White House, discussed ways to keep their relationship
secret and agreed to use the president's secretary Betty Currie as
an intermediary for returning several gifts the president gave the
former intern.
</P>
<P>
   In the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton,
both the president and Lewinsky denied under oath in January that
their relationship involved sex. Clinton has said publicly that he
never asked anyone to lie.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's testimony _ which one source said could be wrapped up
in a day, and another said would take several days _ will set the
stage for Clinton's Aug. 17 appearance before the grand jury by
closed-circuit television.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's appearance Thursday also could be put on hold if
Starr decides to focus instead on a dispute over questions his
prosecutors asked of Lanny Breuer, a White House special counsel
who helped prepare the president's response to the scandal inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The court rulings that cleared the way for Breuer to testify
before the grand jury left open the possibility that the White
House could try to block certain questioning by making additional
claims of attorney-client privilege or resurrecting its earlier
claim of executive privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Early Wednesday, Breuer and a team of White House lawyers met
behind closed doors with U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway
Johnson, who oversees the Starr grand jury. Breuer then left the
courthouse without returning to the grand jury room and without
explaining why he was not resuming his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials declined comment on the outcome of the
hearing and played down Lewinsky's impending appearance before the
grand jury. ``We have no view on it,'' said presidential spokesman
Barry Toiv.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of Starr's inquiry has quickened during the past two
weeks, and Wednesday _ the fourth anniversary of his appointment to
investigate Clinton's business dealings in Arkansas _ the
independent counsel was urged to finish his work quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., wrote to Starr asking him to submit
his report to Congress as required by law ``as soon as possible''
after Clinton's testimony Aug. 17. ``I strongly believe that the
timing of your report should not depend on this year's elections,''
Specter wrote. ``This November's election should neither cause your
report to be expedited nor delayed.''

 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle   Bobbi  and  Kenny McCaughey , the parents of the septuplets born in
Iowa in November, seem to have rethought their early declarations
that they wouldn't capitalize on their family.

SEC MUTUAL FUND REGULATOR LEAVING TO JOIN LAW FIRM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barry Barbash, who as head of the division of the Securities and
Exchange Commission that regulates mutual funds oversaw one of the
fund industry's most rapid periods of growth, said Wednesday that
he would step down next month to join the law firm of Shearman &AMP;
Sterling.
</P>
<P>
   Barbash will become a partner in the firm's Washington office
and will oversee its investment management practice.
</P>
<P>
   In his five years as the fund industry's top regulator, Barbash
oversaw the adoption of regulations that simplified fund disclosure
documents and provided investors with more information about mutual
fund fees and investment risks.
</P>
<P>
   Though his previous tenure as a lawyer representing fund
companies led some industry critics to say that he was too easy on
fund companies, other regulators gave Barbash high marks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barry Barbash has been a tremendously effective and passionate
advocate for the small investor,'' said Neal Sullivan, executive
director of the North American Securities Administrators
Association, a group of state securities regulators. ``He's worked
tirelessly to make sure that mutual fund fees and the risks
associated with funds are understood by investors on Main Street
and not just professionals on Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Levitt Jr., who appointed Barbash shortly after becoming
chairman of the SEC, called the departure ``a great loss to the
commission and to me personally.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, tens of millions of investors are sager and better
informed because of Barry's dedicated efforts,'' Levitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Barbash often said that being director of the division of
investment management, which also oversees financial advisers, was
a lifelong dream. ``When I took the job at the age of 39, most
people thought I was nuts,'' he said. ``They told me I was going to
lose a key part of my earning years.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the greatest thing about the job and having done it is
that now I'll be able to tell my 9-year-old daughter that there's
more to life than just working for money. And I can say it with
conviction because I've done it.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbash is likely to earn vastly more than his government salary
at the firm, and he acknowledged that after five years in the
federal government, as he and his family members grew older, money
was a growing concern.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC has lost several senior regulators in recent months,
including William McLucas, former director of enforcement, and
Colleen Mahoney, a former deputy enforcement director who most
recently was acting general counsel.

Column: Greek games echo with hoop screams
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By FRAN BLINEBURY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece _ The police officer with the sidearm holstered
motioned, then asked in broken English if I had anything to
contribute to the collection that was accumulating near his feet.
</P>
<P>
   He had me open the carry bag that was slung over my shoulder and
peered down inside as if expecting to hear ticking. I had to
surrender the clear plastic bottle that was half full of water. I
had to empty my pockets of loose change and leave it there at the
door. There were fans in the next line who were forced to give up
their sample boxes of Sugar Frosted Flakes that had just been
handed to them about 100 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   As Tony the Tiger would say: ``Gr-r-r-r-r-eat!''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to basketball European style. Or more precisely,
basketball in Greece, where the fans are to enthusiasm what Jerry
Springer is to sleaze. This is Mt. Olympus for wackos, the
birthplace for both democracy and, apparently, the lunatic fringe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greeks are crazy about basketball!'' Pandelis the cabdriver
had told me on the ride here. ``Greeks are crazy about football
(soccer)! Greeks are crazy about politics! I hope you are getting
my point.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why I am standing so patiently in this line outside the
ironically named Peace and Friendship Stadium being patted down for
coins, cigarette lighters, breakfast cereals and anything else that
might be used as a projectile later on if I should happen to
disagree with a referee's call.
</P>
<P>
   This is most serious business. The last time I was searched this
thoroughly, I believe the doctor was checking for an enlarged
prostate.
</P>
<P>
   I have been assured that it is all necessary, based on the
history of the Greek fans, who have somehow managed to escape the
negative worldwide label of the English soccer hooligans, maybe
because they do, at least, keep their antics confined to the inside
of the buildings.
</P>
<P>
   But it was here last year that the Greek fans rioted in the
stands during a loss to Yugoslavia in the European championships.
They booed Yugoslavia's national anthem during the victory
ceremony. They mixed it up with some of the Yugoslavian fans. There
are bitter feelings that remain on both sides today and there have
been accusations of conspiracies involving FIBA (the international
basketball federation), which claim that the game officials have
been instructed to make crucial calls against the Greeks as a
reprisal for the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the rowdy fans at the Delta Center in Salt Lake City,
who have been known to shout bitter racial slurs. Forget the wall
of noise that washes over opponents at Chicago's United Center or
the denizens of the departed Boston Garden, who occasionally tossed
lightbulbs from the upper balcony down onto the playing floor.
</P>
<P>
   This is the ultimate road test in basketball. Call it Homer's
court advantage. A real Odyssey. I'd say it was more of a religious
experience than a sports event, except I'm not familiar with any
religion that doesn't involve dancing with poisonous snakes where
the followers are this blindly devoted and excitable.
</P>
<P>
   Is it something in the hot Mediterranean climate? In their
genes? In their blood? Or maybe just in their ouzo, the sweet
distilled beverage first brewed in ancient Babylon that fuels the
Greek passion today.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you first come here, it takes time to adjust,'' said U.S.
point guard Michael Hawkins, who played for the Greek League
champion Olympiakos last season. ``Greece is like nothing that any
of us ever experienced.''
</P>
<P>
   There is the thick, gray haze from what seem to be the mandatory
cigarettes, which obscures the large ``No Smoking'' signs. When
they say a team chokes here, they might actually be talking about
emphysema.
</P>
<P>
   There are the banners, the signs, the Greek flags, the bugle
calls, the wild-eyed looks on the faces, the crazed gestures, the
clapping, the fist-thumping. And that's just at the press table.
</P>
<P>
   The home team shoots 0-for-17 on 3-pointers in the first half,
2-for-27 in the game. It's a Greek tragedy, moaning, fist-shaking,
cursing from the chorus in the stands. Threats.
</P>
<P>
   The small cluster of Russian fans that has squeezed into the
arena tries to stay inconspicuous until the final minutes when it
is clear their team will win. The police ring their section to
protect them.
</P>
<P>
   The horn sounds, the Russians win, an unhappy crowd begins to
file through the smoky haze. I'm walking out next to a fan whose
face is painted blue and white, like the Greek flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only one solution tonight,'' says Nikos. ``Ouzo.''

   THOMPSON-COLUMN (Washington) _ If Harry Truman returned to Earth
to commemorate the 50th anniversary of his astonishing presidential
campaign against Thomas E. Dewey, he would find the climate
conducive to a reprise of his ``give `em hell'' assault on a
``do-nothing'' Congress. He would also not condone Bill Clinton's
personal behavior. By ROBERT E. THOMPSON. (Already filed)

<P>
   The Boston Globe suspended Mike Barnicle for a month without pay
on Wednesday, an unusual public rebuke of one of the newspaper's
most prominent and pugnacious columnists, after it was disclosed
that sections of his column on Sunday paralleled passages from a
best-selling book by the comedian George Carlin.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter for the Internet site of The Globe's rival, The
Boston Herald, tipped off by an e-mail message from a reader,
compared Barnicle's Aug. 2 column, which ran under the headline ``I
was just thinking,'' to Carlin's book ``Braindroppings,'' and found
10 similar passages.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle, for instance, wrote in his column, ``Someday I'd love
to see the pope appear on his balcony and announce the baseball
scores.'' In Carlin's book, he writes, ``Someday I wanna see the
pope come out on that balcony and give the football scores.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Wednesday, The Globe said it had suspended
Barnicle immediately ``for poor judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   The disciplinary action against the flamboyant columnist came
less than two months after the dismissal of another Globe
columnist, Patricia Smith. Ms. Smith admitted she had fabricated
characters in four columns; an investigation by The Globe found
that at least four dozen of her columns over the past 3{ years
included people whose existence could not be verified.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Ms. Smith's resignation, several people inside
and outside The Globe's newsroom raised questions about whether The
Globe was using a double standard, citing years' worth of sporadic
criticisms of Barnicle's accuracy and originality. Alan Dershowitz,
the Harvard law professor, has charged that in a 1990 column
Barnicle falsely accused him of making an ethnic slur.
</P>
<P>
   In ensuing discussions between Dershowitz and The Globe, a legal
settlement was reached, and all parties agreed to keep the terms
confidential, according to a person who has been briefed on the
details of the settlement. Neither Barnicle nor The Globe retracted
the statement, but the agreement called for The Globe to pay
$75,000 to Dershowitz, this person said. Neither The Globe nor
Dershowitz would comment.
</P>
<P>
   Under an uncomfortable spotlight at the time of Ms. Smith's
resignation, top editors at The Globe, which is owned by The New
York Times Co., checked 30 months' worth of Barnicle's columns and
said they had no reason to believe he had violated journalistic
standards.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's statement, Barnicle is quoted as telling an
editor that ``I try to write a column of one-liners every four or
five months. It's audience participation. Everybody gives me
suggestions about what to put in them. In this case, a friend gave
me some lines to think about. Unfortunately, they were George
Carlin's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I have not read his book, it was a mistake to use
them without checking, a stupid thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Braindroppings'' was one of 17 books Barnicle had
recommended as summer reading in a June 22 appearance on the
television program ``Chronicle,'' on WCVB in Boston. ``A yuck on
every page,'' Barnicle said of the book.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe's editor, Matthew Storin, said in the statement: ``We
accept that Mike did not do this knowingly, but he admits he was
careless in not checking the source of ideas suggested by friends
and that he used poor judgment. Mike has added zest and insight to
our pages for more than 25 years. But he also understands that
there is a price that must be paid for failure to live up to the
newspaper's standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle did not return calls to his home and office Wednesday.
But in local radio interviews, he sounded almost jocular about the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   In an afternoon interview on WBZ he said: ``If you're going to
get suspended, I have a tip for you and anybody else out there in
the audience. It's far better to be suspended in August than it is
in January.''

Everett day-to-day after straining muscle
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
MIAMI _ Astros center fielder Carl Everett stained his left
quadriceps muscle during the fourth inning of Wednesday's 5-3 loss
to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Everett left the field under his own power, and his status will
be evaluated on a day-to-day basis. The injury occurred while
Everett was running out a ground ball. He began to limp as he ran
down the first-base line, and Astros manager Larry Dierker didn't
hesitate to remove him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not overly concerned, but I didn't want to take any
chances,'' Dierker said. ``I know Carl has had some leg problems
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hidalgo moved from right field to center field, and
Derek Bell, who was given the day off, entered the game to play
right field. Everett doesn't believe the injury is serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came out of the (batter's) box, I felt a little tug,''
Everett said. ``It's a good thing I didn't continue to run. I would
have enjoyed to have kept playing, but (Dierker) told me to come
out just in case. It was a good decision. It's been bothering me on
this trip. I don't think it's anything major; it's possible that it
was just a cramp. We'll evaluate it (today).''
</P>
<P>
   Everett usually takes a pill to prevent his body from cramping,
but he forgot to take the pill Wednesday.

 &HT;    Study: Drug may cut spread of breast cancer
 &HT;    By Ellen Lee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A mineral acid compound may reduce the risk of breast cancer
spreading to the bones and organs, researchers in Germany have
found.
</P>
<P>
   In a study published in today's New England Journal of Medicine,
researchers tested breast cancer patients who had a high risk of
developing cancer in their bones. Doctors in Germany's University
Hospital Heidelberg showed that those who took the oral drug
clodronate cut their risk of developing new tumors by two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
   But because the study of the treatment is still in its initial
stages, other researchers said the therapy may not be as beneficial
for organs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready to believe that the benefits in terms of bone are
real, but we're a bit skeptical about the findings in organs,''
said Dr. William Wood, interim director of Emory University's
Winship Cancer Center.
</P>
<P>
   Wood added that researchers plan to conduct a study of a similar
drug in the United States later this year, at Emory and other
sites. The drug, pami-dronate, from the same family of minerals,
may have a similar effect, researchers suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Pamidronate already is given intravenously to women whose breast
cancer has spread to their bone marrow. It helps prevent the
painful breakdown of bone caused by bone marrow tumors.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors in the United States do not prescribe the treatment
tested in Germany because it has not been approved by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   In the German study, 22 percent of the women who took clodronate
in addition to standard treatment developed secondary tumors in
their bones or organs, compared with 42 percent of the women who
got standard treatment only. When members of the clodronate group
did develop new tumors, they had only half as many as the women in
the control group.

Margy Rochlin writes frequently from Los Angeles about film and
television. 
 By MARGY ROCHLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ From the car, it's just a slightly
forlorn-looking, '50s-era beige apartment building on an avenue
lined with leafy sycamores in Beverly Hills. But to Tamara Jenkins,
it contains a particularly vivid childhood memory: This was where,
at the age of 8, she lived with her aging father and her two
brothers until Dad accidentally torched the living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sad story, but completely true,'' began Ms. Jenkins,
who rarely talks without using both hands for emphasis and
punctuation. ``He fell asleep while he was reading a book and the
lamp fell over and the sheets caught fire.''
</P>
<P>
   When he awoke to flames licking the ceiling, Manuel Jenkins
hustled his pajama-clad offspring out into the Los Angeles night.
As a crowd of neighbors began to collect on the street, little
Tamara watched her father approach them one by one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you hear the sonic boom?'' he kept asking. This race-track
habitue and erstwhile strip-club owner had been around long enough
to know that beneath disaster often lay the foundation for a good
scam.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd decided that he was going to sue the United States
government,'' Ms. Jenkins said. Then she detailed his plan to blame
the toppled reading light on military testing. Upon completing this
anecdote, Ms. Jenkins sat back, wreathed in the smoke of her
cigarette, looking up at the home from which they were evicted on
that evening long ago. ``Humiliating,'' she finally said, hands
motionless in her lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slums of Beverly Hills,'' a film that Ms. Jenkins wrote and
directed, is a '70s-era tale about the coming of age of 15-year-old
Vivian Abramowitz (Natasha Lyonne). In it, Vivian and her two
brothers are being schlepped by their 60-something father (Alan
Arkin) from one thin-walled, furniture-deprived domicile to the
next, each barely within the 90210 ZIP code so as to afford them
access to superior public schools.
</P>
<P>
   While on this itinerant venture, Vivian deals with the blunt
attention paid to her abundant breasts and the gnawing
embarrassment that comes with growing up poor when surrounded by
those who famously lack for nothing. At one point, a more worldly
cousin who has escaped from rehab (Marisa Tomei) enters the
picture, buzzing with beauty tips and a battery-operated sex toy.
</P>
<P>
   Although it won't be released until Friday, Ms. Jenkins' feature
debut has already brought her comparison to another expert on
growing up Jewish and twisted, the novelist Philip Roth. ``If
`Portnoy's Complaint' were a girl's story, this would be it,'' read
one of Ms. Jenkins' advance notices.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Ms. Jenkins' wry, semiautobiographical story also
resonated with one of Hollywood's WASP idols, Robert Redford.
Having read Ms. Jenkins' script-in-progress at his Sundance
Filmmaker's Lab, Redford sought out Ms. Jenkins and told her of
having also been raised in poverty in southern California.
</P>
<P>
   And what does Redford recall about the talented young auteur?
``When I met Tamara,'' Redford, who is executive producer of
``Slums of Beverly Hills,'' replied by fax, ``and found she had
grown up as an `outsider' _ as I had _ not at all a member of the
club but a sideline observer from the wrong side of the tracks, I
knew where the voice in her writing had come from.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox Searchlight, the studio that bankrolled the project for just
under $5 million, chose to hold ``Slums of Beverly Hills'' until
the end of the summer: after three months of
civilization-destroying space rocks and giant reptiles, moviegoers
may be desperate to see something they can relate to on a personal
level.
</P>
<P>
   That Ms. Lyonne has Ms. Jenkins' headful of exploding ringlets
seems no accident; nor does the particularly knowing quality in
those scenes in which single parents and their progeny take turns
being the grown-up, or the considerable lengths to which Vivian
goes to find the good in her loving but deeply flawed provider.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the truth-to-fiction ratio in ``Slums,'' Ms.
Jenkins replied: ``The context is true. Some of the people are
true. Some are compilations.'' For the record, there is no
home-blaze plot twist.
</P>
<P>
   It is fact that Ms. Jenkins, who lives with her boyfriend,
Hubert Taczanowski, a cinematographer, on New York's Lower East
Side, departed Los Angeles almost 20 years ago _ and has the
driving record to prove it. During the pre-production stages of
``Slums of Beverly Hills,'' which was shot on location in Los
Angeles, the freshly licensed Ms. Jenkins slid behind the wheel of
her rented Toyota Camry and promptly took out a palm tree on Santa
Monica Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, while conducting a driving tour of her
former neighborhood, Ms. Jenkins delivered a nonstop color
commentary about moves made so frequently that she and her brothers
invented a game in which they quizzed one another on old addresses,
phone numbers and landlords' names.
</P>
<P>
   That Ms. Jenkins chose to be cast in the role of passenger was a
relief to both subject and reporter _ especially because this born
enthusiast reacted to every single thing that caught her eye.
Spotting a couple kissing in the back seat of a Chevrolet
convertible, for example, Ms. Jenkins hurtled toward the
rolled-down driver's side window and hollered, ``Yeah!''
</P>
<P>
   ``We called this Divorce Drive,'' said Ms. Jenkins at one of a
half-dozen stops, then explained that the gang of kids that ran
wild here figured significantly in her romantic evolution.
``Spin-the-bottle was really big. I'm telling you it was, like, the
peak of my sex life here. I'm not kidding.''
</P>
<P>
   On Gale Drive, at the flimsily built complex with a tidy patch
of front lawn, Ms. Jenkins gestured toward the back bachelor unit
and asked, ``Isn't it cute?'' This is where Ms. Jenkins ended up
when her mother, a one-time coat-check girl named Lillian Annett,
chose to let her ex-husband assume responsibility for their three
youngest children.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   During the next 10 years, Ms. Jenkins' life lacked for
convention. Holidays were spent at child-friendly Las Vegas
casinos; basic female rites of passage were handled as one might
assume they would be in a mostly male household.
</P>
<P>
   When her father received a note from her sixth-grade gym
instructor informing him that his daughter was long overdue for her
first brassiere, Ms. Jenkins remembered: ``He threw me in the car
and drove me straight to a department store. It was like I had to
be rushed to the emergency room.''
</P>
<P>
   At a certain point, her living arrangement ``reached critical
mass,'' said Ms. Jenkins. Her father, who died last summer at the
age of 88, was in worse financial shape than usual and had a
matronly, clean-freak girlfriend who ``wasn't fond of having kids
around.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it was that Ms. Jenkins found herself, at age 16, living
in Cambridge, Mass., with her oldest brother, Ron, who had rescued
her in more ways than just by assuming legal guardianship of her
and her youngest brother, Robert.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Ringling Bros. and Barnum &AMP; Bailey clown college
and Harvard (he's now a professor of performing arts at Emerson
College), Ron Jenkins was the first to identify and encourage his
sister's comic abilities. ``He said, `You're really funny,' and I
was like, `I am?' Nobody had ever talked to me about my interior
life.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in the mid-'80s that Ms. Jenkins, then an actress who won
roles only as floozies, saw the confessional storyteller Spalding
Gray recite one of his unrushed monologues. Inspired, she was soon
lugging a slide projector around Boston and earning glowing reviews
as a performance artist who examined her shaky upbringing by
clicking through a carousel loaded with images of relatives and
interacting with their oversized, illuminated visages.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just totally paid attention to her,'' said Connie White, a
co-director of the Brattle Theater in Harvard Square, of the
energetic 23-year-old with the windmill hands and the bright red
lipstick. After catching her act, Ms. White found herself not only
producing Ms. Jenkins' shows, but letting her sneak in daily to the
cinema classics shown at the Brattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``She saw old Jimmy Cagney movies; she saw everything,'' Ms.
White said. ``It was like she was getting her film education. And
then I watched her whole focus shift.''
</P>
<P>
   Several years later, Ms. Jenkins enrolled in the graduate film
school at New York University, using student loans and a day job as
Gal Friday to a wealthy socialite to pay the steep tuition. ``The
first day, I was like, `I don't belong here. These people are
rich,' '' said Ms. Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   One of her classmates and friends was the writer and director
Maria Maggenti (``The Incredibly True Adventures of Two Girls in
Love''), who recalled Ms. Jenkins this way: ``She was smart, fun,
bossy, loud, opinionated, tormented and vulnerable. She's just not
a wallflower, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   Around this era, Ms. Jenkins wrote and directed a pair of
black-and-white short features: ``Fugitive Love'' and ``Family
Remains.'' ``Suburban gothic'' is how Ms. Jenkins classifies the
stylish cinematography of the two efforts, which share a dark joke:
the mothers of Ms. Jenkins' heroines are preening, self-absorbed
divorcees who, aside from criticizing their daughters, seem totally
uninterested in maternal responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone could see that Ms. Jenkins was continuing to
perfect her ability to dismantle her almost stability-free past
creatively and convert it into something more universal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, how did Ms. Jenkins' own mom, who now resides in
Philadelphia with her third husband, react after viewing these
anti-love letters? ``She's seen them,'' said Ms. Jenkins, looking
down and becoming very interested in something, anything, on her
black Fendi sandals.
</P>
<P>
   She was equally speechless when stopped in front of her last
official Los Angeles residence, a four-plex with a fake mansard
roof, boarded-up windows and white paint peeling off in slivers.
``I don't know what happened here,'' she remarked finally.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, she appeared ready to return home to New York _
and to those who know her so well that each will mention that,
although Ms. Jenkins never actually appears on screen in ``Slums of
Beverly Hills,'' it feels as if she does.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has such a strong point of view and an original way of
looking at things,'' said Ms. Maggenti. ``Tam is always Tam and
everything in her movie is such a beautiful, heartbreaking
reflection of who she is. Everything. Even her self-doubt. That
whole, `Is this right? Is this wrong?' stuff. She puts it right
into her work. That's very exciting to see. And I say that both as
a filmmaker and a friend.''

RED SOX ON A WESTERN ROLL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Once more before returning home, they must
put their feet to the fire, this time in a place that usually fits
them as well as a Brooks Brothers suit on a rodeo clown.
</P>
<P>
   They've stumbled before here, deep in the heart of Texas, but
after fairly waltzing up and down the West Coast _ taking two of
three in Oakland, three straight in Anaheim, and splitting a pair
in Seattle _ the Red Sox see little reason to run from the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn, for one, already is looking beyond this four-game set
that will bring an end to their 14-day, 12-game, 7,500-mile tour of
the American League West.
</P>
<P>
   The temperature may still be hovering around the century mark
here, but for Vaughn, the scent of autumn is in the air. Buoyed by
their 6-2 record so far, one that has allowed them to open a
seven-game lead in the wild-card race, the Red Sox first baseman is
talking openly of the team's bid for its first playoff spot in
three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a great season,'' Vaughn said, ``and we want to keep
playing as hard as we can. This team is built on attitude and
focus. We're built on the fact that nobody gave us any credit but
we play every day. We may not match up man for man with some other
teams, we may not have the numbers, but we've got the heart of a
lion, and that's the most important thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're trying to make our move to the playoffs. That's what
it's all about, the next seven weeks. We can smell the situation.
We can see it. We can feel it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the guys are feeling it. I've been there before. I'm
excited. I'm ready to go. I'm looking forward to making things
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Rangers, the Red Sox will be facing the highest-scoring
team in the league, one that last week reloaded by making deals for
a No. 1 starter, Todd Stottlemyre; a power-hitting third baseman,
Todd Zeile; and a new everyday shortstop, Royce Clayton. Zeile
became the first Ranger ever to hit home runs in his first two
games with the club, while Stottlemyre was a winner in his first
start and will face the Red Sox in the series finale Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, however, have been thriving upon a combination of
strong starting pitching, mistake-free defense, an airtight
bullpen, and timely long balls.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox pitchers have a 3.34 ERA on this trip, with the bullpen,
bolstered by the addition of lefthander Greg Swindell, the
rejuvenation of Dennis Eckersley, and the maturation of Derek Lowe,
converting all six of its save opportunities. Tom Gordon, as usual,
has had last call four times, while Lowe, who has pitched seven
straight scoreless innings, has had it twice.
</P>
<P>
   The defense, meanwhile, has been exceptional, making just two
errors on the trip. Tuesday night in Seattle, Darren Bragg had rug
burns on his face after making a diving catch in right field to
take away a hit from Joey Cora. Later in the game, Troy O'Leary
made a leaping catch at the wall to deprive pinch hitter Rob Ducey
of a tying home run.
</P>
<P>
   The night before, John Valentin made a diving backhand stop at
third base to take extra bases away from Edgar Martinez, while
catcher Scott Hatteberg threw out two runners attempting to steal,
including Ken Griffey at third.
</P>
<P>
   In Anaheim, it was Garciaparra, racing into short center field
to run down Darin Erstad's blooper right before the next batter,
Jim Edmonds, homered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I've noticed on this team,'' said Eckersley, who has
been to the postseason more than any other Sox player, ``is that we
have four or five guys doing it who weren't expected to do it.
Darren Lewis, Mike Benjamin, Damon Buford. Derek Lowe, nobody
really knew what he he'd do, and he's been very good. We didn't
know what (Bret) Saberhagen would do and we didn't know Flash
(Gordon) would be perfect. A lot of things have happened. That's
usually what happens when you win. There are surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   And of course, there are the constants: the pitching of Pedro
Martinez, the splendor of Lewis in center field, and the luminous
presence of Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   On a trip that unexpectedly has featured two strong starts by
John Wasdin and a six-inning, two-hit surprise from Steve Avery
Tuesday night, Martinez has mounted an impressive encore to his Cy
Young Award-winning season. When he pitches Friday night against
Rick Helling, he will be bidding for his 16th win, just one fewer
than he had last year with Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, meanwhile, is hitting .412 (14 for 34) on this
trip, scoring a run a game (8), and driving in nearly two a night
(14). He's also had three home runs. Oh, there have been rare
glimpses of imperfection. He has made the team's only errors on the
trip and he forgot how many outs there were while running the bases
Saturday in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   But he hit a huge three-run homer to break open a tight game in
Oakland, another to break open a tight game in Anaheim, and doubled
home a run Tuesday night in Seattle when the Sox were in danger of
being shut down a second straight night by the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, he was told he'd been named the AL Player of the
Week but found it odd that people were congratulating him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means nothing to me,'' he said. ``I want a World Series
ring, and when I get one, I'll want five, one for each finger.
That's why I play. That's the only reason I play.''
</P>
<P>
   This also has been a trip on which the little things have gone
right. Saturday in Anaheim, Benjamin failed to get a bunt down,
then hit a home run. Tuesday night in Seattle, Benjamin was called
upon again to bunt, and this time he moved the winning run into
scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   How many times do you recall the Sox winning a game with a bunt?
Benjamin already has sacrificed 10 times this season; no one on the
Sox had more than five sacrifice bunts last season.
</P>
<P>
   And after Benjamin bunted, the winning run scored because
manager Jimy Williams, with runners on first and third, put the
runner on first, Lewis, in motion. Valentin grounded to short, but
instead of an inning-ending double play, Valentin had a
game-winning RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny,'' Vaughn said, ``but when a team doesn't play
well, the manager gets fired. But when the team plays well, all the
little things it does doesn't even come up. Jimy Williams has kept
this team focused the whole season. He'll bunt and hit-and-run and
give us a chance in the close games. He could be the manager of the
year. No one was picking the Red Sox, but here we are.''
</P>
<P>
   They are here in large part because of Gordon, who faced down
the heart of the Seattle lineup, including Griffey, master of the
Mariners' universe, in the ninth inning of a one-run game Tuesday.
Gordon has a league-leading 32 saves, 28 in a row, the longest such
streak in the majors at this time.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has allowed only one home run all year, to former
teammate Wilfredo Cordero of the White Sox. He has 48 strikeouts
and just 21 walks in 56 innings. He has shown, after the rare
occasions he has pitched poorly, that he possesses a closer's best
friend: selective amnesia.
</P>
<P>
   And though October still looms, he has appeared immune to
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in enough playoff games to know that these are how
the playoffs are going to be,'' said Avery, who with Atlanta
annually went to the postseason. ``Low-scoring, tight games where
we're going to have to rely on Flash in as hard a job as there is.
We need to be ready for these.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers will pose a challenge. The Sox are 61-88 lifetime
here, 13-30 in the '90s. But Vaughn, who spent the last five games
serving as DH while Mike Stanley played first, is looking forward
to being back on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very, very important for us to stay focused,'' he said.
``It was very tough for me, not being in the flow. I'm not meant to
be a DH. If we had lost (Tuesday night) to Seattle, I would have
put a lot of blame on myself for the games here. I had a lot of
chances to break both games open and I didn't come through. But the
team picked me up, and I'm back in the flow.''
</P>
<P>
   Let the Texas two-step begin.

INVESTORS SEE STOCKS WEATHERING STORM

(JT) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jean Taranto isn't the kind of person who frets over
a gyrating stock market. Prices go up and down, sometimes quite
violently, but the American economy appears to be as strong as
ever, she says.
</P>
<P>
   All that is to say that the stock market selloff Tuesday, which
saw the Dow Jones industrial average plunge 299.43 points, is just
one of the things investors will have to get used to. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing to get desperate about,'' said Ms. Taranto, a
teacher from Brooklyn. ``The news people are making it sound like a
catastrophe. But I have a lot of telephone stocks, and my stocks
did okay.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That attitude, one of staying the course _ investing for the
long term and remaining loyal to one of the greatest bull market's
in history _ has time and again guided investors through the bumps
and bruises of Wall Street trading sessions in the 1990s. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But whether such complacency _ or a lack of fear _ is enough to
pull the stock market out of a nasty slump that seems to have been
caused in recent weeks by continuing fears about slowing profit
growth at home and a festering economic crisis in Asia is another
question. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rallied Wednesday, closing
59.47 points higher at 8,546.78. The gains were unremarkable, and
hardly a clear indication of buoyant investor sentiment. Yet they
are a sign that investors are not fleeing the market. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``What am I going to do?'' asks Barbara Lewis, who operates a
bed and breakfast hotel in Cornish, Vt. ``I don't know what I can
do. I think just waiting would be a good way to handle this.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: Americans have had a serious love affair
with the stock market in the 1990s. They now have more of their
assets tied up in the stock market than at any time in the last 50
years. And that means that sharp price movements can rapidly alter
an individual's financial worth.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, of course, a tremendous bull market bubble has
created enormous wealth for many Americans. In 1987, when the stock
market suffered a serious fall, and the Dow fell to 1,738.41, Wall
Street feared a recession. But since then, the Dow has risen as
high as 9,337.97. The question now is: has the market run its
course? And how are investors coping with a summer selloff that has
erased 8.5 percent from the Dow and much more from an array of
smaller company stocks?
</P>
<P>
   The only consensus that has surfaced is that Americans can't get
enough of the stock market. Their optimism has been buttressed over
the years by the bullish calls of Wall Street analysts and
financial planners, who have long held that times are good and that
the best way to save for retirement is by investing in a rising
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any alternative but to wait it out, so I don't
plan to change anything,'' said Dale Strok, an editor of a software
magazine in Long Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is unclear whether summer vacations are skewing
stock market trading and Wall Street's impressions of investor
sentiment. But retail stockbrokers and mutual fund companies said
that telephone lines were not jammed Wednesday and that it was
caution and not panic that had set in recently. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And in interviews with smaller investors around the country,
many of whom have weathered sharp market declines, the attitude is:
the market will come back. ``I'm going to stay the course,'' said
Daniel Saltzberg, a 75-year-old retail clothing consultant. ``This
market has to go up to at least 10,000. The economy is great. And
where else will capital go?'' &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Saltzberg and others point to the events of last summer. A sharp
market downturn began in August with a currency crisis in Southeast
Asia punishing stock prices and set the stage for the fierce
selloff last Oct. 27, when the Dow Jones industrial average dropped
554 points, or 7.2 percent, in a single session. (The market slowly
recovered, and went on to gain more than 30 percent in less than a
year.)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In short, the seasonal volatility could be exaggerating the
market's true course. For while the summer is best known for its
rallies _ and its record highs _ the late summer has also been
known for its volatile swings in prices and the sharp declines that
lead to banner headlines. In August 1990, for example, the Dow lost
about 10 percent of its value as the nation confronted the tensions
in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the knowledge that stock prices can go through violent
swings, and yet still move higher from year to year, may be
comforting investors who believe they can ride out the latest
downturn. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not that concerned,'' said Theodore Garner, a 48-year-old
financial auditor in Portland, Ore. ``I've been in the market for
10 or 12 years and I'm not going to take money out for another 10
years; so it doesn't bother me much. The gains from the mid-1980s
have grown so much that it doesn't matter if the Dow slips back
down to 7,000.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Garner is not alone. A nationwide poll released Monday said that
it would take an ``unprecedented market drop'' of about 1,000
points in a single day to fully shake the confidence of small
investors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, such a drop in the Dow would mean a loss of about 7.5
percent, a figure that is not exactly unprecedented. The Dow fell
22.3 percent on Oct. 19, 1987, and 7.2 percent last Oct. 27. But
such a huge point decline could seem monstrous to investors who
don't realize that gains in points are less significant as the Dow
moves toward 9,000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to the survey, conducted by the America's Research
Group, Americans would alter their investments if an armed conflict
broke out, or the president was impeached. And they could fold if
the Dow plunged by 1,000 points in a single day. But among the
biggest concerns was a rise in interest rates, the same occurrence
that shook bull markets in 1929 and 1987.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Few strategist believe that interest rates are going to climb in
the coming months. But corporate earnings are growing at their
slowest pace in more than seven years and if earnings growth sends
the market into reverse, the experts don't know whether smaller
investors will continue to buy into the slumps. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think the psychology of the small and medium investor
is buy on the dips,'' said Jeremy Siegel, a professor at the
Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and author of
``Stocks for the Long Run.'' ``But what concerns me is not the
first dip, it's the second dip. People who have bought the first
dip have always been winners. But suppose the market continues to
fall. Who will buy then?''

PATAKI, WITH POLLS AND MONEY ON HIS SIDE, ADOPTS NON-CAMPAIGN
STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Last Sunday, Peter Vallone, one of four Democrats
hoping to wrest the governorship from George Pataki this fall,
spoke at three churches in New York City, held a news conference to
receive an endorsement, then raced up to the Orange County fair in
Middletown to press the flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki spent the day at home. It was not just a day off the
campaign trail. It seemed to be his campaign strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Deep into the primary season, at a time when most other
candidates are running hard _ including his would-be Democratic
challengers and his political mentor, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato _
Pataki, the Republican incumbent, seems to be barely breaking a
sweat in his race for a second term. But even as Pataki paces
himself, he has stepped up his aggressive campaign for national
attention, with a book tour, appearances on national television
shows and fund-raising trips that have taken him far afield from
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for example, a Republican contributor in California
or Colorado, where the governor spent three days raising money for
his campaign, had a better chance of getting a glimpse of Pataki
than did a New York voter. He made just two public appearances in
New York _ a 10-minute speech to a police chiefs' association
aboard a Lake George steamboat, and a press conference called on
short notice to react to the Assembly's passage of his bill to
sharply curtail parole.
</P>
<P>
   With Pataki enjoying enormous leads in the polls and in
fund-raising, and the Democrats still facing a hotly contested
primary on Sept. 15, the governor's advisers have decided that the
best way for him to campaign is not to campaign at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're probably right in thinking that way,'' said John
Zogby, a pollster and political analyst. He noted that his most
recent poll showed Pataki leading each of his challengers by more
than 40 percentage points in head-to-head contests.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be as close to a front-porch campaign, or a Rose
Garden strategy, as we've seen in modern times,'' Zogby said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki is hardly the first well-placed incumbent to adopt such a
strategy. Indeed, the man he defeated four years ago for the
governor's office _ Democrat Mario Cuomo _ lay low on the campaign
trail during his re-election races in 1986 and 1990 when he held
huge leads in the polls. And just last year, New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani showed an equal disdain toward the Democrats
clamoring for his job, including the eventual nominee, Ruth
Messinger, whom he soundly trounced.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a risk to Pataki's embrace of such a classic
incumbent's gambit. In the last year, he has aggressively courted
national attention and basked in the political glow as his name has
been mentioned along with those of other Republicans, like Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, in discussions on the race for the White House
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   That has put pressure on Pataki not just to win this fall, but
to win by a margin that will boost his national standing.
</P>
<P>
   Aides insist that Pataki is working hard on the campaign out of
the public eye, averaging two fund-raisers a week and consulting
with strategists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been all over the place,'' said Zenia Mucha, the
governor's chief spokeswoman for the last four years, who became
his campaign manager this week.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign records released last month showed that Pataki had
already spent $2 million on broadcast advertising, and still had
$12 million in the bank, almost six times as much as any of his
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   But his schedule is still filled with trips that take him across
the country in pursuit of thousands of dollars more in campaign
money and widespread national attention. In addition to the
California and Colorado trips, he is planning one next week to
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   When Pataki has taken to the stump during this primary season,
it has been more in the role of incumbent than candidate. He does
not mention the election, and he never refers to his opponents,
even to criticize them. When asked how the campaign is going, all
he will say is, ``Fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's public events around the state, generally no more
than one or two in a day, are invariably billed as the usual
business of being governor, like signing bills or breaking ground
for new businesses. That allows him to avoid appearing overtly
political while touting his achievements, and it also permits him
to travel the state and promote his record at taxpayers' expense, a
luxury his competitors do not share.
</P>
<P>
   His approach has also caused a drag on the campaigns of his
Democratic challengers _ Vallone, Lieut. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross,
District Attorney Charles Hynes of Brooklyn and James Larocca, a
former state transportation and energy commissioner _ who are
hard-pressed to win attention when Pataki ignores their moves.
</P>
<P>
   While Pataki is careful not to seem to be taking things for
granted, his advisers are much less reserved.
</P>
<P>
   When asked recently about polls showing Vallone pulling ahead of
Ms. McCaughey Ross among Democratic primary voters, Ms. Mucha said:
``It doesn't matter. Either way.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was noted that a Democratic primary victory by Vallone
would set up a three-way race, because Ms. McCaughey Ross has the
Liberal Party nomination, Ms. Mucha replied, ``It still doesn't
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the press release earlier this week announcing that Ms.
Mucha was moving from the governor's press office to head his
re-election campaign carried an air of supreme confidence. It
concluded that ``Mucha plans to return to the administration after
the November election.''
</P>
<P>
   At best, it has left the Democrats hoping that the Pataki camp
becomes overly confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are so over-confident _ no, don't print that,'' Vallone
said early this week. ``Better to say they think it's going to be a
cakewalk.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who dropped in on Pataki in each of the last three
summers, and again now, would be hard-pressed to tell which was the
election year. The governor is no more visible, except on
television, and he has stuck to the same few themes _ tax cuts, job
creation and fighting crime _ on the stump and in his television
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are winning, slowly, this fight against crime,'' he
declared at the police chiefs' meeting last week. ``We are turning
the tide and now we've got to make sure the tide goes all the way
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Benjamin, a professor of government at the State
University of New York at New Paltz, said, ``The Rose Garden
strategy makes perfect sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's way ahead,'' Benjamin said. ``The Democrats are beating
each other up, the economy's doing pretty well, and there's no
voter anger this year. And when the time comes, he'll campaign more
actively and blanket the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his situation,'' he asked, ``why do anything?''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 9)  
 (af)  
 By MATT WOLF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Anthony Ward and Mark Thompson often have designed
shows that opened during the same season, and sometimes _ at the
Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-on-Avon, for instance _ even
in the same week.
</P>
<P>
   But the two men, who live together, concede that they found
themselves in an unusual situation last month: separately employed
on competing musicals, two of the season's biggest shows, and with
back-to-back opening nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's strange is that I designed mine a year ago,'' Thompson
said of ``Doctor Dolittle,'' the stage extravaganza inspired by the
1967 film. ``So mine was way down the road, and suddenly Anthony is
in there designing.''
</P>
<P>
   Seated in their connecting, high-walled studios near the north
London home that they share, Ward, who designed the sets and
costumes for Trevor Nunn's new production of ``Oklahoma!,''
described his response to the coincidence. ``The idea of two big
musicals opening one right after another, that's what's sort of
odd,'' he said. In the end, he concluded, ``you've got to just get
on with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Do the two men ever feel a rivalry, in view of the fact that
they have been known to pass projects from one to the other? In
1995, Ward was mentioned as the designer for a revival of Stephen
Sondheim's ``Company,'' a show that ended up _ after it was
``passed across the kitchen table,'' the men said, laughing _ being
designed by Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing we have the most rows about is when we're going to
have time to have a holiday,'' said Thompson, since both are busy
with commissions _ opera and dance included _ until the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctor Dolittle'' opened on July 14 at Labatt's Apollo to
decidedly mixed reviews though considerable applause for Thompson's
elegant and witty designs, which include a riotous jumble of a
study for Dolittle, in which animals from Jim Henson's Creature
Shop can be seen poking out from among the rows of books.
</P>
<P>
   The next night, Ward's startling visual take on ``Oklahoma!''
was one component of many to win acclaim in the new staging for the
Royal National Theater. His is a pioneering American West where the
corn really is ``as high as an elephant's eye,'' as the Hammerstein
lyric says.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the double opening merely confirmed what those in
the English theater have known for at least a decade. Both men are
at the center of an unusual array of London-based designers who are
busily reimagining the potential of what the director Peter Brook
long ago called ``the empty space.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Ward and Thompson, both 41, others of their generation
include Bob Crowley and Richard Hudson, Tony Award winners for
``Carousel'' and ``The Lion King,'' respectively. (Crowley's
Arabian Nights-tinged design for ``Twelfth Night'' is on view at
the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center in New York.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are such younger designers as Rob Howell, Es
Devlin and Christopher Oram, all of whom prefer a theater of visual
suggestiveness and metaphor to anything naturalistic.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson is represented on Broadway by the Tony award-winning
``Art,'' whose simple visual chic is crucial to the seductive
spareness of the production. In Thompson's aesthetic, no detail is
wasted: a white carpet in the middle of the set, he pointed out, is
intended to suggest an island, inasmuch as Yasmina Reza's play
concerns ``three people isolated from the rest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Thompson received a Tony nomination for his designs for
Tom Stoppard's ``Arcadia,'' a dense play given visual allure by a
simple rotunda that looked out onto a verdant image of English
pastoral _ truly arcadian _ existence.
</P>
<P>
   The room's curve, Thompson said, was to suggest ``a sounding
board, in realistic terms a forum in which discussion could take
place. But spiritually it was meant to be feminine as well: there's
a sort of femininity about the play, a sort of sexiness.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Having made his Broadway debut in 1990 with ``Shadowlands,'' the
play about the writer C.S. Lewis, Thompson might end up returning
to New York twice this season if Ms. Reza's current West End hit,
``The Unexpected Man,'' and David Hare's imminent ``Blue Room''
(based on ``La Ronde'' by Schnitzler, which opens in London on
Sept. 22) cross the Atlantic as hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Ward was nominated for a Tony two seasons ago for the RSC's
visiting production of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' which
inhabited its own unique glade of dangling light bulbs, boldly
deployed colors and a flying, upturned umbrella capable of
containing an evening's assignation. He is currently at work on a
new adaptation of ``The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,'' from
the C.S. Lewis story.
</P>
<P>
   It opens in Stratford on Dec. 1 and is directed, as was ``A
Midsummer Night's Dream,'' by Adrian Noble. Their ``Cymbeline,''
with its Orientalist influences, was seen at the Brooklyn Academy
of Music earlier this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Warchus, the director of ``Art'' and ``The Unexpected
Man,'' is a friend of both designers. He considers them, along with
Hudson of ``The Lion King,'' to be ``quietly revolutionary.'' Their
work, Warchus said, ``is often about simplifying and stripping
things away, following something through to a very, very clean and
defined point, and being consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   When you read a script, said Ward, ``you're trying to find the
soul of it, the center of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That isn't necessarily all about walls and doors,'' he said.
``It can be something very abstract.''
</P>
<P>
   For ``Oklahoma!'' that meant responding visually to the great
open plains of pioneer country while forsaking potential cliches.
``We didn't want any gingham,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to design the 1982 Maury Yeston musical ``Nine'' for its
London premiere 18 months ago, Ward came up with a large oval table
underneath an angled, tarnished mirror. The result was a subtly
Fellini-esque nod to the show's source, the Fellini film ``8{.''
</P>
<P>
   In Thompson's case, when reconceiving ``Company,'' he
deliberately avoided images of the New York skyline in favor of a
brightly checkered floor. ``That piece of art was my response to
Manhattan,'' he said. ``It was this mad, hectic thing, but it also
realistically could be an installation in someone's loft.''
</P>
<P>
   The director Phyllida Lloyd has worked with both men on many
occasions. She was, in fact, the person who introduced them 14
years ago when Thompson needed an assistant. Ms. Lloyd suggested
Ward, who was a friend of her landlady's at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rang Anthony up,'' Thompson recalled, ``and said did he want
to come and help, and he said, no, there was no way he was going to
help anyone his age. But he thought I had a sexy voice, and I
thought he had a sexy voice.'' They were living together within six
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was remarkable how quickly they became very close
friends,'' said Ms. Lloyd, who finds them complementary. They
certainly are in appearance: Thompson is dark, while Ward is fair.
``Anthony works very much through his emotion,'' Ms. Lloyd said.
``He's always looking for the metaphorical heart of the piece
rather than simply trying to find solutions to each scene. Mark is
a much more rational being: he's got an architect's brain'' _ as
befits the son of an architect.
</P>
<P>
   It may be significant that while Thompson has an academic
background _ he was a classmate of Ms. Lloyd's at Birmingham
University _ Ward graduated from the Wimbledon School of Art in
London and spent time as a model-maker for Hudson, the designer.
</P>
<P>
   Ward spoke gratefully of Thompson's expertise: ``I used to have
a nervous breakdown about technical drawings, and Mark would do
them for me. I'd go to the theater, and they'd ask me all these
questions. I wouldn't have a clue and I'd stand there bluffing
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Having Thompson around, said Ward, ``is like having a chum right
there.''

HARRELSON TESTIFIES IN APPEAL FOR NEW TRIAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional ending) 
 
By THADDEUS HERRICK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The man convicted of killing a federal judge in San
Antonio almost 20 years ago testified Wednesday that prosecutors
conspired with his defense attorney to make him a scapegoat in a
crime that remains among the most shocking in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Harrelson, the legendary south Texas hustler who federal
prosecutors maintain collected $250,000 for shooting Judge John
Wood in the back with a hunting rifle, told his story in a
courtroom for the first time since his 1982 conviction. He hopes to
get a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hung out to dry because people in Washington, D.C., had
to have a solution,'' said the 60-year-old Harrelson, both folksy
and articulate on the witness stand. ``They did not get the killer
of Judge Wood but they got their solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson, the father of actor Woody Harrelson, was the final
witness in a three-day proceeding aimed at establishing whether the
elder Harrelson had been represented by a secondary defense lawyer
who himself was at one time a suspect in the May 29, 1979, murder
of the judge. Such a conflict of interest is among the key points
Harrelson's lawyers are arguing in their bid for a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   But Harrelson used his opportunity as a witness to go well
beyond the relatively narrow scope of the hearing. He told &UR;  &LR; federal
prosecutor Ray Jahn, the same man who prosecuted him in the Wood
killing, that he ``despised him.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson said Jahn and other federal prosecutors involved in
the trial pressured Tom Sharpe, his attorney, to withhold evidence
that could have helped acquit him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Mr. Sharpe came to see me at the behest of the U.S.
government,'' said Harrelson, offering little evidence to bolster
his claim of collusion. ``I believe a complete perusal of this case
will reach that conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   After he testified, his son gave him a broad smile and a
thumbs-up.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Fred Biery of San Antonio, who held the
hearing in Colorado for reasons of fairness and security,  &UR; s &LR; aid he
expects to make a decision on the bid for a new trial in the next
several months.
</P>
<P>
   The assassination of Judge Wood was called ``the crime of the
century'' by one San Antonio congressman. Known as ``Maximum John''
for his lengthy sentences, especially those involving drug dealers,
Wood was at the time of his death preparing to try Jimmy Chagra, an
El Paso drug kingpin. Chagra, who feared Wood, was believed to have
hired Harrelson in the contract killing.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Chagra's brother Joe, who once served as Harrelson's
lawyer, became the government's key witness in the case. But
lawyers for Harrelson believe Joe Chagra's testimony was tainted,
since he made it as part of a deal with federal prosecutors to
reduce his own drug charges. Joe Chagra is now dead.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Harrelson's lawyers argue that their client had hired
Sharpe, who in turn sought help from attorney Alan Brown as an
investigator in the case. Yet, the lawyers said, Harrelson was
never told of a tip by a San Antonio murder convict that Brown and
several others were at one time suspects in the case and that
Sharpe ignored the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there is something there,'' said John Cline, one of
Harrelson's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Both Sharpe and Brown testified, however, that Brown was never a
serious suspect in the Wood murder nor did he act as Harrelson's
lawyer during the trial. They beseeched Judge Biery to consider the
credibility of each side when making his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you going to believe?'' asked John DePue, a lawyer for
the Justice Department. ``Two officers of the court and members of
the state bar or an individual who is accused of the most heinous
affront to the criminal justice system in the history of our
nation?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson's reputation does not necessarily help his cause. He
was convicted as the triggerman in a 1968 &UR;  &LR; murder-for-hire scheme
in south Texas, and charged in another such case but acquitted. He
has faced cocaine and firearms charges.
</P>
<P>
   When in 1995 he was caught trying to escape from a federal
penitentiary in Atlanta, he was moved to a maximum security prison
in Colorado, known as Supermax. There he is among 350 or so of the
nation's boldest convicts.

LEWINSKY SET TO APPEAR BEFORE GRAND JURY 

</HEADLINE>

By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Monica Lewinsky, the woman at the center of an
alleged presidential affair and cover-up, is scheduled to make her
long-awaited appearance before a federal grand jury Thursday to
talk about her relationship with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As the 25-year-old former White House intern and her legal team
met a final time with prosecutors who will lead the questioning
before grand jurors, the president visited Capitol Hill where he
was greeted warmly by House Democrats at a meeting at which the
Lewinsky investigation was not discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't come up, not even indirectly,'' said Rep. Nick
Lampson of Texas as he emerged from the president's closed-door
session with the House Democratic Caucus. Although not spoken, the
scandal was not far from the Democrats' minds. ``The silence was
deafening,'' said California Rep. Vic Fazio.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, former White House deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes
and five Secret Service employees testified before two grand juries
being used by independent counsel Kenneth Starr's prosecutors to
speed their inquiry into whether the president or any of his
associates engaged in an illegal cover-up of his alleged
extra-marital activities.
</P>
<P>
   At the federal courthouse where the grand juries meet, the U.S.
Protective Service beefed up security to deal with a larger than
usual crowd of reporters, photographers and tourists expected with
Lewinsky's appearance.
</P>
<P>
   On one of the large television trucks outside the courthouse, a
weathered sign alerts the curious: ``We're here for the Ken Starr
grand jury. Monica is not here.'' On Wednesday, the sign was
amended to read: ``But check back tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the case confirmed that Lewinsky was due to
testify Thursday but noted that the schedule of witnesses could be
changed overnight by Starr. ``There's a 99 percent chance she'll
appear,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press quoted an unnamed source saying that
Lewinsky was emotionally drained by the rehearsals for her grand
jury appearance and was torn by the prospect of providing testimony
that would conflict with Clinton's sworn statement denying they had
ever had sex.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, who last week was given immunity from prosecution by
Starr, reportedly told prosecutors that she and Clinton engaged in
sex at the White House, discussed ways to keep their relationship
secret and agreed to use the president's secretary Betty Currie as
an intermediary for returning several gifts the president gave the
former intern.
</P>
<P>
   In the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton,
both the president and Lewinsky denied under oath in January that
their relationship involved sex. Clinton has said publicly that he
never asked anyone to lie.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's testimony _ which one source said could be wrapped up
in a day, and another said would take several days _ will set the
stage for Clinton's Aug. 17 appearance before the grand jury by
closed-circuit television.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's appearance Thursday also could be put on hold if
Starr decides to focus instead on a dispute over questions his
prosecutors asked of Lanny Breuer, a White House special counsel
who helped prepare the president's response to the scandal inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The court rulings that cleared the way for Breuer to testify
before the grand jury left open the possibility that the White
House could try to block certain questioning by making additional
claims of attorney-client privilege or resurrecting its earlier
claim of executive privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Early Wednesday, Breuer and a team of White House lawyers met
behind closed doors with U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway
Johnson, who oversees the Starr grand jury. Breuer then left the
courthouse without returning to the grand jury room and without
explaining why he was not resuming his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials declined comment on the outcome of the
hearing and played down Lewinsky's impending appearance before the
grand jury. ``We have no view on it,'' said presidential spokesman
Barry Toiv.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of Starr's inquiry has quickened during the past two
weeks, and Wednesday _ the fourth anniversary of his appointment to
investigate Clinton's business dealings in Arkansas _ the
independent counsel was urged to finish his work quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., wrote to Starr asking him to submit
his report to Congress as required by law ``as soon as possible''
after Clinton's testimony Aug. 17. ``I strongly believe that the
timing of your report should not depend on this year's elections,''
Specter wrote. ``This November's election should neither cause your
report to be expedited nor delayed.''

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the last three years investors have been
sleepwalking their way to riches in the stock market. Putting money
into a stock index fund _ a one-decision move _ has proved not only
the best way to avoid underperforming the averages, but also the
path to outsized profits. The Vanguard Group's fund that mirrors
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index has almost doubled since the
end of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But the heyday of this particular investment strategy may have
ended on Tuesday when the Dow Jones industrial average lost 300
points. Even though the major market averages rebounded ever so
slightly Wednesday, the action belied what might be the beginning
of a big shift in investor psychology.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was extremely heavy and exceedingly volatile Wednesday.
More shares traded hands on the New York Stock Exchange than had
during the big drop on Tuesday. The averages whipsawed up and down
all day, with the Dow ending up almost 60 points, or 0.7 percent,
and the S&AMP;P 500 rising almost 1 percent. The Nasdaq lagged, gaining
only .014 percent on the day.
</P>
<P>
   Although investors were undoubtedly relieved that stocks held
their own, the market's chop was discomforting. Market strategists
predicted more rough spots in the weeks to come. ``If we were down
another 600 points on the Dow, I wouldn't be surprised,'' said
Carey Leahey, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, a
investment consulting firm in Valhalla. ``Not that the U.S.
fundamentals aren't good, it's just that they're not good enough to
sustain stock valuations.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday, investors had seemed to shrug off the idea that
rising stock valuations had to be sustained by ever-rising
corporate earnings. Now, the relationship between a company's stock
price and its earnings is front and center for both professional
and individual investors across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   That reassessment makes some market watchers believe a profound
shift in stock market strategy is under way. What has worked in the
past may not work in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boring is going to outperform sexy,'' said Robert Olstein,
manager of the Olstein Fund and a veteran of Wall Street and its
passing fads. Instead of just looking at where a company's stock
price is headed, investors will be focusing on the company's
underlying business and how well it is performing. ``There is going
to be more looking behind the numbers, more scrutiny paid to
nonrecurring write-offs, more religion adopted.''
</P>
<P>
   What that leads Olstein to conclude is a return to active money
management, the type of hands-on stockpicking that comes from
analyzing balance sheets and income statements. If this type of
strategy becomes more profitable than buying a fixed basket of
stocks, a practice known as indexing, it would represent a big
change. Last year, only 10 percent of money managers who actively
select stocks outperformed the S&AMP;P 500, down from 70 percent in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   With the two most widely followed market indexes down nearly 9
percent from their July peaks on no fresh bad news, a change in
market psychology has clearly taken place. If Olstein is right
about the new direction, and a chorus of fund managers agree with
him, then investors may begin shunning the index strategy that has
been so popular in recent years. In the first five months of this
year, 18 percent of the net cash flows into equity mutual funds
went to index funds, up from 11 percent in the comparable period of
1996, according to Strategic Insight, a New York mutual fund
research and consulting company.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, with corporate profitability looking weaker and
weaker, stocks that have taken the indexes to all-time record
valuations _ Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Dell Computer, General Electric
_ are much more vulnerable to disappointment than they were when
earnings expectations were rosier. Wall Street analysts began the
year believing that the earnings among the S&AMP;P 500 companies would
rise 8.5 percent in 1998. Seven months later, these forecasters say
earnings will grow only 5.6 percent. This may turn out to be
optimistic as well.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the stocks in the S&AMP;P 500 are trading at 25.66 times
their earnings of the last year, some stock prices carry
significant premiums to what they will likely produce in earnings
growth this year.
</P>
<P>
   The result? ``I think we'll see a shift in what stocks the
market punishes,'' said Nancy Tengler, money manager at Global
Alliance Value Investors in San Francisco. ``Investors will say `I
can pay 12 times earnings for 12 percent earnings growth or I can
pay 50 times earnings for the same 12 percent growth in the case of
Coke.' You're going to see people move more defensively.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One reason for this, Ms. Tengler believes, is that the
volatility of recent weeks, the Dow up 100 points one day, down 100
points the next, is more than most investors want from their stock
portfolios. Although these folks still believe the stock market is
the place to be, they may want to take a more defensive posture.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's market plunge may not have convinced all investors
that their old practices of chasing earnings surprises and big
market movers no longer work. But several brokers who deal with
small investors say that most of their customers' calls Wednesday
came from those wishing to reconfigure their portfolios in a more
sensible way. These investors were weeding out highfliers for more
stable names.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas in recent months, the sexier the stock the better _
think high-flying Internet companies with no profits and maybe no
revenues _ the dullest companies in the doggiest sectors may now be
where the greatest profits lie.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, investors reconstituting their portfolios have
the chance to buy some stocks at fairly reasonable prices. The
average New York Stock Exchange issue has lost more than a quarter
of its value from the high, while the average Nasdaq stock is down
more than 35 percent. This damage has produced buying opportunities
unseen for years by value investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an opportunity to buy companies that pay you for
uncertainty upfront via a dividend and generate earnings growth
going forward,'' said Ms. Tengler. ``And they're cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tengler recently identified 180 stocks in the S&AMP;P 500 that
she considers good buys because of their relatively high dividends.
At the end of 1996, she found 140 such stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks that look attractive to Ms. Tengler include Halliburton,
the oil service company; Eastman Kodak, Phillip Morris, H.J. Heinz
and American Home Products, the pharmaceutical concern. Olstein is
a believer in semiconductor equipment makers like Altera Corp.,
Xilinx Inc., and oil service concerns such as Rowan Cos. He also
says companies building the infrastructure for communications will
be winners _ especially Superior Telecom and Corning Inc. _ as will
beaten-down steelmakers LTV Corp. and AK Steel Holding.
</P>
<P>
   Will old-fashioned stockpicking once again outperform the
indexes as it did in previous eras? They say that everything old
becomes new again, even perhaps in the world of investing. If so,
investors can welcome back the age of reason. &QL;

IRAQ ENDS ITS COOPERATION WITH U.N. ARMS INSPECTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The government of Saddam Hussein said Wednesday
for the first time that it was ending all cooperation with U.N.
arms inspectors in Iraq and effectively demanded the dismissal of
the chief inspector, Richard Butler, through a restructuring of his
disarmament commission.
</P>
<P>
   While the immediate effect of the Iraqi announcement remains to
be seen, the action Wednesday clearly breaks the agreement made in
February with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan that averted
American and British military action against Iraq. In that
agreement, Iraq pledged to ``cooperate fully with the U.N. Special
Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency'' and to
grant them ``unconditional and unrestricted access'' to sites in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, who returned from Baghdad Wednesday afternoon after the
abrupt breakdown of crucial talks there on Monday, is to meet with
the Security Council on Thursday. He met with Annan for an hour
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secretary-general and I certainly agree that there is a
syndrome here _going around the same track again and again,''
Butler said after the meeting. ``We have to find a way to break
that. That's up to the Security Council.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate reports from Baghdad on repercussions
from Saddam's order. More than 100 inspectors, laboratory
scientists and technical experts from a number of countries were
working Wednesday at the Baghdad monitoring center or are based
there on temporary inspection assignments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am instructing people to go about their normal work,''
Butler said Wednesday of the inspection teams in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In their statement Wednesday, the Iraqis also urged that the
disarmament panel, the U.N. Special Commission, be moved to Geneva
or Vienna, Austria, from New York to free itself of American
influence.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi government repeated its demands in letters Wednesday
to Annan and the Security Council. Annan Wednesday night postponed
a trip to Portugal, where he was planning to meet East Timorese
leaders, to attend the Security Council session on Thursday. At the
White House, a spokesman for the National Security Council
dismissed the Iraqi action as ``bluster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard this bluster before,'' said the spokesman, P.J.
Crowley. ``We've seen this petulance before. But at the end of the
day we'll judge the situation by Iraqi actions, not words.''
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council has been deeply divided on the issue of
sanctions against Iraq, and there was no indication Wednesday how
Thursday's meeting would end. The Russians, who have been strong
supporters of Iraq, seemed to be holding Butler at least partly
responsible for the latest crisis. Iraq has tried to deepen Council
splits while also undermining Butler.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are strongly convinced that Iraq is not the only one to
blame for this situation, when a decision has been taken to break
discussions,'' said Yuri Fedotov, Russia's deputy representative.
``This decision we understand was taken by the chairman of UNSCOM
without duly consulting the secretary-general and the Security
Council.''
</P>
<P>
   Before meeting with Annan, Butler told reporters that when he
went to Baghdad last weekend he was close to the end of his work on
Iraq's missile and chemical weapons programs, though there remained
much more work to be done investigating biological weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
   An independent international technical evaluation last month,
one of a number demanded by Iraq, concluded that Baghdad had not
met the commission's requirements on accounting for biological
arms. Butler described the biological file Wednesday as being ``in
bad shape'' and said that the inspectors needed a lot more
information.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Iraq must account for all biological, chemical, missile and
nuclear programs and production systems before the Security Council
can lift sanctions under the 1991 cease-fire resolution passed
after the Persian Gulf war. The next major review of sanctions
takes place in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were getting there,'' Butler said to reporters. ``If this
was a five-lap race, we were halfway into the fifth lap. Why stop
the race when you're getting to the finish line? I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Butler in Baghdad said that he never got to have
a substantive discussion with the Iraqi team, led by Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz. Officials said that Aziz and his colleagues
appeared relaxed, even smug, as they simply stated and restated
what apparently had become a high-level policy line: that there was
nothing left to talk about, that Iraq had ended all its weapons
programs and that sanctions should be lifted without further ado.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement published in Baghdad Wednesday, Saddam said that
only surveillance cameras set up by the commission, known as
UNSCOM, would be allowed to operate. Significantly, this would be
closer to the level of monitoring Iraq would face if sanctions were
to be lifted, as Baghdad demands.
</P>
<P>
   The statement issued Wednesday also warned UNSCOM inspectors
that they would have to ``respect Iraq's sovereignty, security and
dignity.'' Iraq has in the past classified some inspections as
intrusions on sovereignty and put areas off limits.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi government has threatened to end cooperation with the
inspectors several times in the last year, but since the
disarmament program began in 1991 Iraq has never formally done so.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the Iraqis expelled American inspectors, whom Baghdad
accused of being spies. Butler responded by recalling all his
inspection teams, and no work was done for several weeks. Russia
brokered a deal that ended the crisis, but Iraq soon followed with
an announcement that all huge presidential properties were off
limits.
</P>
<P>
   The weeks of tension that ensued led to the deployment of
American and British troops and warships to the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, France and China _ as well as some members of Annan's
staff _ have recently supported the Iraqis in their criticisms of
Butler, an Australian arms control expert who is frank in his
manner and thorough in running the inspection system. At one point,
Iraq complained that they preferred more ``normal'' U.N.
inspections, not investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The Special Commission is not a ``normal'' U.N. body, however.
It is a creation of the Security Council and has considerable
autonomy and investigative powers. That, essentially, is Iraq's
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Token gestures of compliance have been rejected by Butler and
his predecessor, Rolf Ekeus, a Swedish diplomat who is now his
country's ambassador in Washington. Both have been accused by the
Iraqi government of being too close to the United States and too
willing to carry out American policy.

   CUBA-CASTRO _ MIAMI _ Summer is always the time for feverish
speculation about the health of aging Cuban President Fidel Castro,
who turns 72 on Aug. 13, and this summer is no exception. Just a
few weeks ago, a Cuban doctor-turned-defector living in Costa Rica
claimed that Castro suffers from a fatal brain disorder. There was
a barrage of similar ill-health rumors last summer, some even
announcing Castro's death. But, if anything, Castro appears more
robust than ever. He appears to be traveling more these days than
at any time in his 39 years in power. He continues his commitment
to communism, even as he's been striking a conciliatory tone
towards President Clinton. (Emling, Cox News Service).

LEWINSKY EXPECTED TO TESTIFY THURSDAY ABOUT CLINTON AFFAIR 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr. and JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Six months after news of her relationship with
President Clinton first riveted the capital, Monica Lewinsky is
scheduled to appear Thursday morning before a federal grand jury
here to describe an affair with him that she previously denied
under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, 25, has become the star witness of Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr's sex-and-cover-up inquiry since she struck
an immunity agreement last week that sent tremors through the
Clinton White House and renewed talk of impeachment proceedings in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky is expected to tell grand jurors that she had a
sexual relationship with Clinton, flatly contradicting his
finger-pointing denial last January to the American people, as well
as his denial in a sworn deposition in the Paula Jones
sexual-misconduct lawsuit, lawyers familiar with her account said.
</P>
<P>
   She is also expected to testify that she and the president had
agreed to deny a relationship and discussed ways, often
hypothetically, to conceal it from the public, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Lewinsky met again Wednesday with prosecutors to
prepare for her grand jury testimony, Clinton traveled to Capitol
Hill to visit with congressional Democrats, who greeted with him
raucous cheers and numerous standing ovations. But the public
reaction masked a widespread concern among members of both parties
that the inquiry into the president's personal affairs could have a
powerful but unpredictable effect on their own political fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of Ms. Lewinsky said Wednesday night that the
25-year-old former intern is looking forward to completing her
grand jury testimony, perhaps this month, so she can get on with
her life. But Ms. Lewinsky is also said to be concerned that her
testimony may hurt the president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to testify before the grand jury, via
closed-circuit television from the White House, on Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are just as high for Starr's inquiry, which began
four years ago Wednesday as an investigation of Whitewater, the
Clintons' failed Arkansas land deal. Since then, the inquiry has
evolved into an investigation about whether Clinton lied under oath
and conspired to cover up a sexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
   When they introduce Ms. Lewinsky to the grand jury Wednesday,
prosecutors will portray her as a credible witness. But that task
is complicated by the former White House intern's own words heard
on 20 hours of audiotapes surreptitiously recorded by Ms.
Lewinsky's former friend and colleague, Linda Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   For six months, the 23 grand jurors have listened to the
tape-recorded voice of Ms. Lewinsky as she plotted to conceal a
sexual relationship with Clinton, according to lawyers familiar
with the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have lied my entire life,'' she said on one tape, according
to those lawyers. It is not known if grand jurors have listened to
that portion of one tape.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, on Jan. 7, Ms. Lewinsky signed an affidavit in which she
denied having had a sexual relationship with Clinton. But after
learning she was a target of Starr's inquiry in mid-January, Ms.
Lewinsky offered to admit that she had a sexual relationship with
Clinton. And after six months of negotiations, Ms. Lewinsky agreed
to testify in exchange for complete immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ms. Lewinsky must persuade grand jurors that she was lying
then, and is telling the truth now. She was scheduled late
Wednesday to testify Thursday morning, but Starr has occasionally
switched witnesses at the last minute.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky is expected to tell grand jurors the story of how
she first met the president in November 1995 during the federal
government shutdown and how the relationship blossomed into an
affair, according to a lawyer familiar with Ms. Lewinsky's
debriefings this week.
</P>
<P>
   She is also expected to be asked questions about gifts given to
her by the president, including a gold brooch and a book, ``Leaves
of Grass'' by Walt Whitman. She turned over those gifts to Betty
Currie, the president's personal secretary, in late December, after
lawyers for Ms. Jones had subpoenaed them, lawyers said. They said
that Ms. Lewinsky has told prosecutors that the president had told
her, ``If you don't have the gifts, you can't turn them over.''
</P>
<P>
   It is likely that Ms. Lewinsky will be asked about her navy blue
cocktail dress, which continued to be tested at the FBI crime lab
Wednesday. Starr's prosecutors asked the crime lab to test the
dress to see if it contained physical evidence of a sexual
encounter between Ms. Lewinsky and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The test results were not known Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton advisers responded with a shrug Wednesday to the
prospect of Ms. Lewinsky's testimony. They said they have been
reassured by news accounts in recent days that she will not testify
that Clinton attempted to obstruct justice by urging her to lie
under oath or by trying to line up a job for her.
</P>
<P>
   Further, they argued that the public will not be surprised by
her testimony. Recent public opinion surveys suggest that most
people already believe that Clinton lied about his relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky, but do not want to see him sanctioned for it.
</P>
<P>
   While Congress might seek to impeach the president over
obstruction of justice, some Clinton advisers believe, it is far
les likely to do so over perjury about an intimate relationship _
if perjury was committed and could be proved.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Lewinsky prepared Wednesday, Starr continued to take
testimony at the federal courthouse in Washington. Former deputy
White House chief of staff Harold M. Ickes was at the courthouse
for more than six hours. Ickes first testified before this grand
jury two weeks ago, after several Secret Service employees were
summoned to recount the president's routines in and around the Oval
office.
</P>
<P>
   As he left the courthouse Wednesday, Ickes refused to talk about
his testimony, telling reporters, ``I'm done and I hope never to
come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Secret Service officers, out of five summoned to the
courthouse, also testified Wednesday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   White House special counsel Lanny Breuer returned briefly to the
courthouse, but he did not testify. Instead, he attended a closed
hearing before Judge Norma Holloway Johnson over his refusal to
answer some prosecutors on grounds of executive privilege and
attorney-client privilege, according to those familiar with the
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Johnson did not rule Wednesday on Breuer's situation, and
has already rejected those claims for other top aides, including
the president's closest adviser, Bruce Lindsey. For months, the
White House has engaged in a running battle with Starr over what
questions he may put to the president's closest advisers. The White
House dropped claims of executive privilege in Lindsey's case after
Judge Johnson ruled them impermissible. It has appealed another
finding by Judge Johnson that the attorney-client privilege could
not protect government lawyers from testifying in a criminal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington affirmed
Judge Johnson's decision, ruling that government lawyers had an
obligation to cooperate in a criminal investigation. The White
House now says it intends to appeal to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, the Appeals Court noted that government lawyers
may still be protected by executive privilege, in certain
circumstances, and that finding appears to have emboldened the
White House to threaten to invoke the privilege to shield Breuer
from some questions.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House has also again invoked attorney-client
privilege. The White House is concerned that Starr is trying to
pierce Clinton's attorney-client privilege with his private lawyers
by questioning Breuer about his conversations with them.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has been at pains to conduct business as usual
during these extraordinary proceedings. Late Wednesday afternoon,
members of the counsel's office threw a surprise party for Breuer,
a key but low-profile aide made suddenly famous on his 40th
birthday Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides were also quick to note that Wednesday was the
four-year anniversary of Starr's appointment as independent
prosecutor to look into the Clinton's real estate investment in the
Ozark mountains. They have repeatedly argued that he has
unnecessarily prolonged and broadened his investigation to include
matters like the firing of the White House travel office staff and
the White House's possession of FBI files on prominent Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``After four years and $40 million,'' said Rahm Emanuel, a
senior Clinton adviser, ``Ken Starr has earned the unique
distinction of taking an investigation from a real estate deal
through the travel office to the files to the Lewinsky matter, and
has ended up picking up two known investigation into his office.''
He was referring to inquiries into whether prosecutors have
illegally disclosed grand-jury information.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Starr on Wednesday, Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., a
former prosecutor, called for the independent counsel's office to
submit a report to Congress ``as soon as possible'' after the
president's Aug. 17 grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I strongly believe that the timing of your report should not
depend on this year's elections,'' Specter wrote.

MARKETPLACE: SEC SAYS SONY MISLED INVESTORS ON MOVIE LOSSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Movie flops like ``Last Action Hero,'' starring
Arnold Schwarzenegger, ``Geronimo: An American Legend'' and ``I'll
Do Anything'' cost Sony Corp. hundreds of millions of dollars in
the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But shareholders got few hints in Sony's annual reports about
the money that was then bleeding from its Hollywood studios.
Instead, it bragged to shareholders about its successes and hits
like ``Sleepless in Seattle'' and ``Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission said that
Sony had misled investors in the months leading up to Nov. 17,
1994. That's the day Sony shocked Wall Street by announcing that it
was writing off the value of its movie studios, Columbia Pictures
and Tristar Pictures, by $2.7 billion because of their poor
performances.
</P>
<P>
   The commission fined Sony $1 million _ equal to the highest fine
ever leveled against a company in a securities case that did not
involve fraud. The commission also ordered the company to have
independent auditors examine the section of its annual report where
management provides details of business results for investors.
Never has the commission made such a request.
</P>
<P>
   Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, Sony accepted the
commission's order to ``cease and desist'' from such practices in
the future. If it does mislead investors again, it will face much
more severe penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Sony said Wednesday that it had been talking to the commission
and trying to settle the complaint since December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sony recognizes the importance of corporate disclosure and has
decided to consent to the issuance of the order and will fully
comply with the terms,'' a company spokeswoman said. She said that
Sony, a Japanese company whose American depository receipts trade
on the New York Stock Exchange, would have no further comment on
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   In its complaint, the SEC said that Sony officials had ignored
the advice of outside auditors and its financial officers in the
United States to provide details separately on the dire condition
of its movie business in its financial reports. Instead, the
company ``obscured'' the movie studio losses, the commission said,
by combining them with profits from its music division under the
category ``entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the company discussed only select positive
results from its movie studios _ for example, its Academy Award
nominations _ in its 1994 report to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   In its annual report filed with the commission in September
1994, Sony disclosed that the results from ``a number'' of motion
pictures had been disappointing. It also said that the
entertainment segment's operating income had declined 58 percent
from the year before. But again, there was no mention of Sony
Pictures Entertainment's $448 million net loss or the more than $1
billion in losses that had accumulated since Sony bought the movie
studies in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Just two months later, in a surprise announcement, Sony said
that it was reducing the value of its Hollywood studios by $2.7
billion. The company said that it was forced to take that loss
because it could never hope to recover its investment in the
studios caused, in part, by a wave of executive resignations and
rising costs.
</P>
<P>
   Add to all that a string of costly disappointment at the box
office, most noteworthy ``Last Action Hero.'' At the time, film
critics said Schwarzenegger had spread his stock character too
thin.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's complaint, the SEC said that Sumio Sano, a Sony
director, had helped the company misled investors. At the time,
Sano was general manager of the company's capital market and
investor relations division and was responsible for the shareholder
reports and news releases that the commission said were inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokeswoman said that Sano, now president of Sony
Precision Technology, a subsidiary in Japan, declined to comment on
the commission's action.
</P>
<P>
   In its most recent annual report to shareholders, Sony
separately reported for the first time the profits of its movie and
music divisions. For the year ended March 31, the movie division
had operating income of $269 million, while the music side earned
$410 million.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also ordered the company to have independent
auditors examine the section of its annual report known as
``management's discussion and analysis.'' In that section,
management must give investors a more detailed look at the
company's results and future prospects.
</P>
<P>
   While the SEC requires all public companies to file financial
statements that have been audited, the rest of the disclosures in
reports filed with the commission need not be audited.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
approved standards for auditors to follow when examining
disclosures outside the financial statements. Those standards
allowed the commission to order Sony to have auditors examine the
management details that Sony includes in next year's annual report.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Sony's ADRs _ each representing one share of the
company _ rose 68.75 cents, to $82.75, on the New York Stock
Exchange.

CLOCK TICKING ON BLAKE DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ In a bit more than five weeks, the Los
Angeles Kings will begin training camp for the 1998-99 season. The
lingering question this summer is whether their Norris
Trophy-winning defenseman, 28-year-old restricted free agent Rob
Blake, will be signed in time to accompany them onto the ice.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Dave Taylor, when asked if Blake would be signed
sooner or later, said, ``If I had to guess, I'd say later.'' Taylor
then joked that as long as Blake signs by ``Sept. 12, in the
morning'' _ a reference to the first day of camp _ he'll be happy.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Blake's agent said he is ``cautiously optimistic''
but acknowledged that the sides have not met recently, in large
part because Taylor has been sidetracked by other matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the ball is in their court,'' added agent Ron Salcer of
Manhattan Beach, who used to be Taylor's agent. ``I have confidence
they're going to get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not a simple task. Blake made $3.15 million while leading
NHL defensemen with 23 goals last season and will be looking for a
raise after being honored as the league's best defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis' 35-year-old Al MacInnis, who signed a three-year,
$15-million deal after last season, is the league's top-paid
defenseman. Beyond getting paid his market value, Blake has said
he's conscious _ as the recently elected vice president of the NHL
Players Association _ of his need to sign a contract that will
benefit his fellow union members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only one guy is going to set the standard, and that's me,''
Blake said recently. ``I've got to make sure it's a good deal and
doesn't hurt anyone else around the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, however, has been busy on other fronts, this week
attending NHL meetings in Nashville. Last week, Taylor signed the
two Kings who had filed for arbitration, getting defenseman Sean
O'Donnell to agree to a three-year deal worth a total of $3
million, and signing winger Craig Johnson to a two-year,
$1.55-million deal.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever he signs it, Blake's contract will exceed the combined
total value of those contracts in its first year. Taylor has five
restricted free agents to sign besides Blake: defenseman Aki Berg,
center Nathan LaFayette, wingers Steve McKenna and Matt Johnson,
and goalie Jamie Storr.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side for the Kings, Salcer said Blake has received
no inquiries to date from teams interested in signing him to an
offer sheet. The Kings would have the opportunity to match any
offer Blake receives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every team in the league would love to sign Rob,'' said
Salcer, who would not say how much money Blake is seeking. ``But
they recognize that the L.A. Kings have an ownership with deep
pockets and would never let Rob go. I think Dave recognizes the
need to get Rob signed and in training camp. But other things
became more pressing, and we're waiting.''

 &HT;    Ligtenberg feeling like one of the guys
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Kerry Ligtenberg, the Braves' closer-designate and
savior to the bullpen, was a replacement player who crossed strike
lines to pitch with the Seattle Mariners in 1995. Some in the
Braves clubhouse don't even know. The club did not intend to keep
the matter a secret. It's just worked out that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never really come up,'' said Ligtenberg, who appeared in
three ``scab'' games before leaving the Seattle club. ``I don't
think it's a big deal. Everybody's been cool.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Minnesota, where he pitched a second season in
the independent Northern League. He was signed by Atlanta the
following offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Since, he has been blackballed by the Players Association. Upon
the urging of, among others, Braves union representative Tom
Glavine, Ligtenberg was one of 10 ex-replacement players (including
New York Met Rick Reed) who petitioned unsuccessfully last year for
admission to the union. While Glavine thinks it is only a matter of
time until certain cases like Ligtenberg's _ unknowing long-shot
prospects who subsequently made the majors _ are allowed into the
union, he has not been surprised by Ligtenberg's assimilation with
the Braves. ``Everybody likes him,'' said Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but there is inequity every time Ligtenberg takes the
field. Not only is he ineligible for any licensing fees and
union-negotiated endorsements which could bring up to an extra
$100,000 to his $170,000 salary. But every time he saves a game, he
is doing so for a union shop that will not have him as a member.
</P>
<P>
   Ligtenberg discounts the money. If he was after salary, he said
he would have taken a $50,000 chemical engineering job right out of
college rather than play for $650 a month in the Northern League.
And if the Players Association won't have him, Ligtenberg has dealt
with that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing for me is I wanted to be accepted as a teammate,''
he said. ``I wanted to be on the same team with these guys and not
looked down upon. That's what I wanted more than anything here and
there hasn't been any probem at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Stocking the farm
</P>
<P>
   From the pitchers remnants pile, the Braves signed left-hander
Norm Charlton and right-hander Paul Wagner to minor-league
contracts Wednesday after both had been released in late July. Both
pitchers were assigned to Class AAA Richmond, where the pitching
staff has been refurbished in the last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking a chance,'' said manager Bobby Cox. ``It doesn't
cost anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner was 1-5 with a 7.11 ERA in Milwaukee in 13 appearances
(nine starts) this season, which included two stints on the DL
(gastro-intritis and viral infection).
</P>
<P>
   Charlton was released by Baltimore July 28, after compiling a
2-1 record with a 6.94 ERA in 36 appearances with the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Up for bid
</P>
<P>
   The Negro League replica uniforms worn by the Braves during last
weekend's Heritage Salute will go up for auction Aug. 21-23 at the
Braves Foundation FanFest. The 1940 Atlanta Black Crackers
uniforms, as well as the 1958 Braves replicas the club wore in
their first visit back to Milwaukee in June, will be sold. Last
year, similar throwback uniforms generated over $30,000, which the
Braves, as they will this year, turned over to charity.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Do not adjust your TV. Andruw Jones' hair continues to change
color. He arrived at the park Wednesday with a slightly browner
hair tint, claiming his mother and his girlfriends helped adjust
the tone from the orange shade of the day before. ``My mom thinks
it looks good,'' Jones said. . . . When Bobby Cox stepped into the
cage for some early pre-batting practice swings, shortstop Ozzie
Guillen took a look and said, ``Where'd we sign this kid? He's from
Curacao too?''

 &HT;    On deck: Cincinnati Reds
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: 7:40 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   TV/radio: TBS, 750-AM.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: RHP Greg Maddux (14-5, 1.61; 13-11,
3.33 lifetime vs. Reds) vs. LHP Mike Remlinger (6-11, 4.63; 1-2,
4.40 lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The Braves have hit Remlinger for a .280 average, which
is not exceptional except when the home run is factored in. The
current Atlanta roster has seven homers among its 28 career hits
off the left-hander, a high rate in just 45 innings. He is 0-2
against Atlanta this season but has given up just five earned runs
in 10 1/3 innings. The long ball hurt May 11, when the Braves
nailed him for a pair of three-run homers, by Andruw Jones and
Andres Galarraga. He lost to Atlanta 3-2 last Monday and one of
those runs scored on a throwing error after Andruw Jones stole
second and third base within three pitches. Statistically, Maddux
continues to mow down the opposition. In five starts since the
All-Star break, he has given up eight earned runs in 38 1/3 innings
(1.88 ERA) but has won just twice. Part of the reason is offensive
support. In three of those games, the Braves have scored two runs
or fewer behind him, including a shutout by Chicago July 21.
Atlanta's defense has also accounted for five unearned runs in
those games.

 &HT;    Falcon QB Graziani hopes to put nightmarish debut behind him
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- For Tony Graziani, Friday can't come soon enough.
It's been almost 10 months since the nightmare in Charlotte, where
the Atlanta Falcons' backup quarterback got his only career start _
and played miserably.
</P>
<P>
   Graziani didn't make it to the second half against Carolina on
Oct. 26, when, subbing for injured starter Chris Chandler, the
rookie completed just four of 18 passes for 24 yards with two
interceptions in a 21-12 Panthers win.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's preseason opener against the Tennessee Oilers,
however, Graziani will be the man again, at least for the most
part. Chandler will start, but coach Dan Reeves said his
second-year QB will play about three quarters. The Falcons are not
only trying to figure out if Graziani is capable of being their
backup but also whether the left-hander is worth keeping around for
the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Nervous, Tony?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm excited. I haven't had a chance to play since the last
time at Carolina, so I'm anxious to get back out there and play
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Graziani, a seventh-round draft choice from Oregon, played only
once after the Carolina game and didn't throw another pass.
</P>
<P>
   He has a career passing rating of 3.7 after completing seven of
23 passes for 41 yards and two INTs. (Yes, you read correctly.)
Chandler was second in the NFL last year with a 95.1 rating.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Graziani said, that's old news. The 6-foot-2, 210-pounder
worked hard in the offseason to gain about 15 pounds and add
strength. He had a difficult time with some throws last year, and
he thinks he's improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've matured a lot ... learning the offense and defenses,'' he
said. ``And any time you add strength, it helps. It gives you
confidence you can make the 'out' throws''
</P>
<P>
   The easy-going Graziani seems to have a good approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``You forget about (poor outings),'' he said. ``If you don't,
you won't be around long. You put it in the back of your mind and
just go out there.''

 &HT;    `I used to think of myself as a bounty hunter'
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- With career highs of 94 tackles and 12 sacks last
season on a unit that was second in the NFL with 54 sacks, right
end Chuck Smith made a big difference for the Atlanta Falcons. In
defensive coordinator Rich Brooks' grading system, Smith was at the
top, 71 points ahead of second place. Atlanta is counting on more
of the same from Smith, 28, who has two more years on his contract.
Falcons beat writer Matt Winkeljohn sat down with Smith during a
break at training camp and filed this report:
</P>
<P>
   AJC: How are things different in camp this year?
</P>
<P>
   Smith: We've got a lot of guys who have played with coach Reeves
for a year, and everything is gelling. The thing that is so hard
about the transition to a new coach is (that) everything is so new
and you don't know what to expect. That puts another kind of
pressure on you. Now, you know what's expected and what won't be
tolerated. Things are a lot crisper.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: Much has been made of the lack of depth on the defensive
line. Is it a big problem?
</P>
<P>
   Smith: I don't know how this became an issue. In the league
right now, a lot of teams are worse off than we are. Now, if you
get guys hurt, that changes things. (Former starting right tackle)
Dan (Owen) was a loss (in free agency), no doubt. But look at
Pittsburgh. They keep losing guys, and other guys step up. It's
(former backup and new starting right tackle) Shane (Dronett)'s
time to step up. We've got (seven-year veteran) Esera Tuaolo, who
has started other places. I think it's overblown.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: Do you buy the widely held contention that at 6-foot-2, 262
pounds, you're undersized?
</P>
<P>
   Smith: Man, I don't even pay any attention to that
``undersized'' stuff. In the last couple years, have you seen Chuck
Smith get knocked on his back? Nope. When you see me hit a tackle
on the weak side, do you see his head pop up? But when Reggie White
hits them, does he knock people around, throw them around like I
do? Not any more. Not taking away from the guy's greatness, but the
way I look at it, it has nothing to do with size.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: You've had 238 tackles and 34.5 sacks the last four years,
but some would say you haven't gotten your due, including your
omission from last year's Pro Bowl. What does it take?
</P>
<P>
   Smith: I don't know. What's a dominant player? Look at all those
big-name ends over the last four years, and are their stats any
better than mine? People say (the Giants' Michael) Strahan (who had
69 tackles and 14 sacks last year, and 160 tackles and 17 sacks the
previous three years) is dominant. He's my friend, but he hasn't
done what I've done. Use (Tampa Bay tackle Warren) Sapp, for
example. And then look at a guy like (tackle) Sam Adams from
Seattle. That's guy's dominant. Wayne Martin (of the New Orleans
Saints) kicks people every week. But you hardly hear about those
guys.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: You've been tagged with the ``dirty player'' label. Why?
</P>
<P>
   Smith: I think it started back when I was on special teams, and
I used to do a lot of renegade stuff to get attention. I used to
think of myself as a bounty hunter. I wanted to hunt guys and knock
the (expletive) out of them. When (former coach Jerry) Glanville
was here, that was very important. Then (in '95 against Carolina),
they threw (current teammate) Bob Christian a dump pass, and he
dove and I dove and when I landed on him, I think it broke a rib.
Everybody was saying that was dirty. Then, a year later, they said
I hit (Carolina quarterback) Kerry (Collins) when he was on his
knees, intentionally. It just sort of added fuel to the fire. If
people get injured, that's the breaks.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: How do you think the Falcons are perceived around the
league?
</P>
<P>
   Smith: We did so many crazy things here in the past that
referees almost still expect it, and we don't get the close calls.
The more disciplined we are, like we are with Dan, the more we'll
start to get calls like that.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: Who's the hardest quarterback for you to sack?
</P>
<P>
   Smith: Steve Young, not necessarily to rush, because I always
beat (49ers tackles), but to sack. It's tougher against Steve,
because he can always watch me (because Young is left-handed and
faces Smith). He always tells me, ``I'm watching you.'' If you go
under, he's outside of you; if you go outside, he goes inside. He's
almost impossible to tackle by yourself.

 &HT;    Holyfield to fund fight in Dome
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Tired of waiting on investors to back his proposed
heavyweight title fight at the Georgia Dome, Evander Holyfield will
tap into the only financial source he knows he can depend on:
himself.
</P>
<P>
   A deal was completed Wednesday for Holyfield's IBF defense
against Vaughn Bean on Sept. 19 because the champion agreed to
share in the monetary risk with Showtime cable network and promoter
Don King.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot easier to do this ourselves _ then I know it'll be
done right,'' Holyfield said. ``I have confidence that the people
will support this. If it does well, it won't cost me a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be the first boxing match in the Dome and Holyfield's
first fight in Atlanta since he defeated Bert Cooper at the Omni in
1991. The Dome will be configured with a setup of 40,000 to 45,000
seats.
</P>
<P>
   King indicated that details about the card, including ticket
information, probably will be announced at a news conference
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield said he started thinking about financing the card
after hearing last week from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution about
the lack of solid investors. ``I told Don and Jim (Thomas, his
attorney), 'If nobody shows up with the money, we'll do this
ourselves.' I need to get back to training.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision capped a bizarre day in which Atlanta promoter
Waymon Harley thought he had reached an agreement with King and
local investors to stage the program. Harley said he had agreements
from a casino investor and record companies to cover the $3 million
site fee, one-third to be paid by Friday and the rest 10 days
later.
</P>
<P>
   Harley was stunned when he was informed of Holyfield's deal, but
he said, ``I can understand it. Mr. King gave me a fair shot at
this and I couldn't pull it off in time.'' Harley claimed that he
had invested ``countless hours'' and ``thousands of dollars''
</P>
<P>
   With the fight only six weeks away, Holyfield plans to train in
Houston for two weeks, then return to Atlanta to help the
promotion. He will train at his home gym in Fairburn and the
Holyfield Arena in West End.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bean, a Philadelphian with a 29-1 record, is ranked No.
1 and is getting a mandatory title shot, he is neither a household
name nor a feared opponent. The promotion will focus more on the
angle that Holyfield will be fighting in his hometown, probably for
the last time.

 &HT;    The making of Buckshot Jones
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Buckshot Jones takes a break from his crash course in
Stock-Car Racing 101 this week _ don't look for him; he has gone
fishing. But the schedule to prepare the young Tucker driver for
life in NASCAR's fast lane resumes full throttle next week.
</P>
<P>
   Jones will test at Darlington on Monday and Tuesday; he'll make
personal appearances in Brooklyn, Mich., on Wednesday; and he'll
use the rest of the week at Michigan Speedway preparing for the
Pepsi 200 Busch series race on Aug. 15 and the DeVilbiss 400
Winston Cup race on Aug. 16.
</P>
<P>
   This is Jones' personal grand prix of endurance to catch up with
the racing world. But from the beginning of his racing career in
1991, coming from behind has been the key ingredient in the making
of Buckshot Jones.
</P>
<P>
   He has the talent, the marketing and the racing nickname that
has him on the verge of moving into NASCAR's highest division. He
will compete in seven Winston Cup races this season before racing a
full schedule in 1999. His team has broken ground on a shop in
Spartanburg, S.C. It has been an unusual climb, but all systems are
go. It has been that way from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   When Buckshot's dad, Billy, agreed to fund his son's racing
career, he did so with these orders: Start every race in the rear
the first two years and work your way up. ``I said, `Son, anybody
can start out in front by themselves,' '' Billy Jones said. ``But
you've got to learn how to get around all those cars to become a
good driver.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan has worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two races he's won in Busch, even though he might not have
started in the back, he wound up in the back and had to come all
the way from the back to the front,'' Billy said. ``The first one
he ran, he got spun out, and that put him all the way in the rear.
The one he won four weeks ago, they hadn't even got to the flag
stand, and he got bumped and shoved into the wall. He not only went
to the back, he had to pit and still came back to win that race. He
said, `I reckon all those years of coming from the rear didn't hurt
me none.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Buckshot also is coming from behind career-wise. Jeff Gordon,
who turned 27 this week, virtually went from diapers to a race car.
Jones, 28, went to the University of Georgia, where his dad sent
him to get a business degree before he'd pay for the racing
venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``You compare him to Jeff Gordon, he's 20 years behind,'' Billy
said. ``Buckshot's racing with guys younger than him who have twice
the experience, three times the experience. But he's got that drive
inside of his soul that's allowed him to do what he's done, along
with the assistance of my finances. If it hadn't been for the
finances, I doubt if anybody would have taken a chance on him
starting out that late in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckshot has not dominated at any level of racing. The idea was
to get the hang of it and move up to the next level. He didn't win
his first race, a 75-lap Late Model feature at Peach State Speedway
in Jefferson, until his third year. ``He's still learning,'' Billy
said. ``But I truly believe this: You give him a car that feels
good under him, and I don't care who they are, he'll run with them.
Whether it be Winston Cup or Busch, he'll run with them. His
problem is getting the car to feel exactly the way he wants it,
because he still doesn't have enough knowledge to be able to tell
his crew chief exactly what it is about the car he don't like.
That's why (crew chief) Ricky Pearson has been so valuable. Ricky
has been able to figure some of it out without Buckshot telling
him.''
</P>
<P>
   On practice days, they go to tracks together, Pearson fiddling
with the car and Buckshot trying to articulate just how the car is
performing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys like Rusty Wallace and Mark Martin, they'll call their
crew chief and say, `I'm comin' in, take a half-a-pound of air out
of the right rear. Or put a half-pound of air in the left rear,' ''
Billy said. ``They know exactly what they need. Buckshot is not
there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy was a race-car driver for eight years, but he's smart
enough to know that other experts may have the answers his son
needs. In Buckshot's first year of racing, Billy hired short-track
veteran Billy McGinnis to work with him and tell him if Buckshot
had a chance to be successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy (McGinnis) was the first person to tell me he'll make
it,'' Billy Jones said. ``He said, `He's got the feel in his butt.'
I asked him what he meant. He said, `He feels that car moving under
him; he feels it in his butt. I watch him, I can tell what he's
doing.' So he called Buckshot in and asked him why he did this and
that. Buckshot said, `I felt the car slip.' Billy turned around,
looked at me and didn't say a word.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckshot also has what his father calls ``fire in the foot.''
He's not afraid to stay on the gas in the corners. ``He's had a
reputation of being a little bit aggressive on the race track,''
Billy Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Buckshot seemed to be working on a tradition when he
crashed his car the first eight tries at qualifying in Busch races.
He's also had a fender-banging feud with driver Randy LaJoie that
has resulted in fines for both.
</P>
<P>
   Buckshot wrecked last weekend in the Brickyard 400 at
Indianapolis, but he dismissed the accident with Brett Bodine,
another Jones critic, and Joe Nemechek as ``just another of them
racing deals.'' He finished 27th.
</P>
<P>
   He finished third on Saturday in the Busch race at Indianapolis
Raceway Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sat on (the) pole,'' Buckshot said. ``But when we came in
for four tires while leading the race, our air-gun wrench broke. By
the time we got the gun working, we lost a few positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Another hard lesson learned.
</P>
<P>
   Billy is a millionaire who made his money in the fiber-optics
construction business despite only an 11th-grade education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a glorified ditch-digger,'' he said. ``Started out with a
shovel and a pickup truck.''
</P>
<P>
   His favorite quotation by Einstein hangs on his office wall:
Imagination is more important than knowledge. And it was that
imagination that gave him the vision that Buckshot could be
successful in racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there would have been anybody else who would
hire him at the beginning, with his limited experience,'' Billy
said. ``It was hard to find a sponsor, because the only deals I
would make would stipulate they had absolutely no say-so. I don't
need anyone else putting more pressure on the team. That's why I
have $6 million of my own money in this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy is sure his investment will pay off. He's got a marketing
prize in his own son. To generate souvenir sales, Buckshot was the
first Busch driver to show up at his souvenir trailer to sign
autographs. Now, two independent studies have ranked him 12th and
13th in all of racing in sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do over a million in souvenirs,'' Billy said.
``Buckshot's personal appearances could be up a thousand percent,
if he had the time.''
</P>
<P>
   He's got the great nickname, given to him by his grandfather,
and the number OO, which stands for double-ought buckshot,
big-pellet ammo familiar to hunters. He's got the underdog stature:
At 5-6, Buckshot's barely taller than his car. And he is annoyingly
polite, full of yes-sirs and no-sirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he first started racing, people heard that name and they
expected to find some 6-foot-5 guy with a beard, wearing bib
overalls and barefoot,'' Billy said.
</P>
<P>
   The Jones' five-year plan moved ahead of schedule when Buckshot
joined the Busch circuit in his fourth year behind the wheel. Now
Billy sees his team being competitive in Winston Cup sooner than
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm right where I want to be right now,'' Buckshot
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two more years, and he'll be a contender,'' Billy said. ``Two
years, and I think you'll see him kicking on the door. What makes
me feel that is he got in a strange race with a strange crew and
finished eighth at one of the toughest race tracks in NASCAR (at
Dover Downs). He may get in the next two races and not finish
better than 30th. But he showed me enough at Dover that he's almost
there. I think you'll see him do well next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that mean I think he'll win a race? No. Will I be
surprised if he does? No. Going into a Cup car is going to be tough
because it's more horsepower. He's going to have to learn that.''

 &HT;    Wohlers' wife files for divorce
 &HT;    By Jay Croft
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Braves pitcher Mark Wohlers, already suffering a
tough year on the field, took a major hit in his personal life
Wednesday when wife Nancy filed for divorce.
</P>
<P>
   The petition in Fulton County Superior Court says that the
marriage is irretrievably broken and that the couple has no chance
at reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   They wed Dec. 31, 1992, and have a daughter who turns 2 this
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Wohlers is hopeful that they'll be able to have an
amicable resolution,'' said her attorney, Steven Montalto. ``I
don't believe there's anything about this situation that I think
anybody's going to care to read about. It's just your typical
irreconcilable-differences situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The petition says Nancy Wohlers reserves the right to cite other
grounds for divorce if an agreement can't be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark intends to handle this matter with dignity,'' said his
lawyer, Jeffrey B. Bogart. ``It is a private matter between him and
his wife. They have a small child, which is his most important
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Wohlers, 30, is seeking custody, unspecified child support
and alimony. Her petition seeks sole use of their home in Country
Club of the South in Alpharetta, the possessions in it and a 1997
Mercedes S320 until the divorce and division of property are
finalized.
</P>
<P>
   Her petition says the couple has been separated since July 17,
while both remained in the family home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that's the case,'' Bogart said. ``They live in
the same residence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We found out for certain'' about the divorce on Wednesday,
Bogart said. ``Mark did not file for divorce, so that should be
self-explanatory. This was Mrs. Wohlers' decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Bogart said the pitcher, 28, hopes to enter into mediation as
soon as possible.

GUERRILLAS OVERRUN KEY ANTI-DRUG BASE IN COLOMBIA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN OTIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Colombian rebels, pressing their most deadly
offensive in years, reduced a key police anti-narcotics base to
smoking rubble and killed, wounded or captured nearly all of its
defenders, authorities said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Following the frenzy of guerrilla assaults that broke out Monday
night in 17 of the nation's 32 states, President Ernesto Samper
said 68 soldiers and police were killed and 87 were wounded. But
police officials reported that at least 100 soldiers, police
officers and civilians were killed by the rebels across the
country. Samper claimed that at least 180 rebels were killed, but
other officials put the toll at a lower number.
</P>
<P>
   The bloodshed dampened the national mood of celebration for
President-elect Andres Pastrana's inauguration Friday. Pastrana has
pledged to bring an end to the country's 34-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The base, 180 miles southeast of Bogota in the jungle town of
Miraflores in Guaviare state, was overwhelmed by about 700
guerrillas who struck late Monday with rockets, mortars and
machinegun-fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The base is totally destroyed. It is smoking,'' said Luis
Rodriguez, a Miraflores resident, in an interview with Bogota's
Radionet. ``There are no soldiers left in the town and no police.
They were all taken away'' by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   According to one police estimate, 30 soldiers were killed, 50
were wounded and more than 100 police and army soldiers were listed
as missing and may have been taken prisoner by the rebels. However,
Gov. Hernando Gonzalez Villmizar of Guaviare state, said that the
bodies of just eight soldiers had been located in Miraflores.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombian military was unable to immediately respond to the
attack due to stormy weather and fears that aerial bombing runs
would leave many civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intention of the guerrillas was to finish off half the
country,`` said army Gen. Fernando Tapias.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Enrique Montenegro, head of Colombia's version of the FBI,
said the attack caught the military by surprise and blamed failures
in the country's intelligence establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Military aircraft began evacuating the wounded late Wednesday
and some stores in the town were open for business, Gov. Villamizar
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Miraflores base is an important target for the guerrillas
because it serves as a refueling station for police crop-dusters
that eradicate coca plants, the raw material for cocaine. The
spraying program is part of a U.S.-supported effort to wipe out the
crop.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas earn millions of dollars annually by taxing drug
traffickers for each coca-laden plane leaving the region and by
providing them with protection. Much of the estimated $100 million
in U.S. military assistance that Colombia will receive this year is
earmarked for anti-drug operations.
</P>
<P>
   Although U.S. civilian pilots rotate through the country to
train Colombian crop-dusters, a U.S. Embassy spokesman said that no
American personnel were in Miraflores during the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Colombia eradicated 74,000 acres of coca and about
17,000 acres of opium poppies, a 25 percent increase over the
previous year. But according to U.S. officials, Colombian farmers
planted 18 percent more coca last year and about 196,000 acres
remain under cultivation.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia is the world's No. 1 supplier of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the devastation at Miraflores, a U.S. State Department
official said that the raid would have a ``negligible'' impact
because the main base for crop-dusters is located in the provincial
capital of San Jose del Guaviare, about 100 miles northwest of
Miraflores.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many Colombians seemed shell-shocked by the extent of the
onslaught carried out by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC, and the National Liberation Army, or ELN.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an emergency situation,'' said Rodrigo Lloreda, the
incoming defense minister. ``We will encounter a reality that is,
unfortunately, quite negative.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, authorities said that 46 soldiers, guerrillas and
possibly civilians were killed in heavy combat in the town of Uribe
in Meta state.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Alfonso Lopez Caballero said that about 500
rebels attacked the town for 14 hours Tuesday, destroying city hall
and the police station.
</P>
<P>
   An air force bombing campaign to drive out the rebels provoked
panic, and hundreds of townspeople were fleeing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sporadic fighting was also reported Wednesday in parts of
western Cauca state.
</P>
<P>
   In Medellin, Colombia's third-largest city, one person was
killed and 11 injured when someone tossed a grenade at pedestrians
on a downtown street.
</P>
<P>
   President-elect Pastrana remains optimistic. He has agreed to
demilitarize Uribe and four other municipalities to facilitate
peace talks with the FARC's rebel leadership. The 44-year-old
former mayor of Bogota met with rebel commanders in the mountains
of Colombia last month and pledged to open peace talks within 90
days of taking office in an effort to end the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Also last month, the ELN signed an accord in Germany to initiate
peace talks by October. On Wednesday, Pastrana insisted he would go
forward with the demilitarization plan even though many now
question the rebels' true desire for peace.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department spokesman, speaking from Washington,
condemned the rebel campaign. ``We are disappointed that after
initial peace talks in Germany and Colombia, the guerrillas are
engaged in these senseless attacks,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts insisted that the guerrillas were attempting to
put themselves in a stronger negotiating position for eventual
talks and predicted that the next year will be especially bloody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think the conflict is going to get worse before it
gets better,'' said Pedro Valenzuela, a political science professor
at Xaveriana University in Bogota. ``The process is going to be
extremely long and torturous.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabas Pretelt, a Bogota business leader and head of the
Federation of Merchants, called on his countrymen to continue to
demand peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is terrible what has happened,'' said Pretelt, who has been
involved in peace talks with rebel leaders, ``but Colombians must
insist on the peace process for the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The darker the night, the brighter the dawn,`` he said.

 &HT;    RUMOR THAT BLACK VOTING RIGHTS IN DANGER IS FALSE
 &HT;    270&AMP;add
 &HT;    By REBECCA CARR
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It started out as one of those rumors spread
through e-mail on the Internet: African Americans are going to lose
their right to vote when a section of the Voting Rights Act expires
in 2007.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail spread like wildfire, with notable African Americans
discussing it in forums and on radio talk shows. As it grew, so did
concern among African American lawmakers in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., and other members of the
Congressional Black Caucus are planning to use Thursday's
anniversary of the 1965 Voting Rights Act to knock down the claim
that when the law expires, so will the right for African Americans
to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``These false claims state that blacks will lose the right to
vote in 2007 if Congress does not reauthorize the Voting Rights
Act,'' Lewis said. ``This is not true.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, just one section of the Voting Rights Act is scheduled
to expire in 2007. That section calls for the states to submit any
proposed changes in their election laws to the U.S. attorney
general for approval to ensure that the change does not
discriminate against minorities.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Congress has simply extended that provision of the
law when it expired, and it is likely that it will do the same in
2007. In addition, the 15th Amendment to the Constitution also
guarantees the right to vote regardless of ``race, color or
previous condition of servitude.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a keen interest in ensuring the continued vitality of
the Voting Rights Act, and do not take lightly any threats to this
law,'' Lewis said. ``The only way we will lose our right to vote is
by not voting.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and other members of the caucus also hope that the
anniversary will lead the nation to reflect on the state of race
relations in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of race has been around for a long time,'' Lewis
said. ``We must continue to confront it. Those of us in leadership
must remind people about the distance we have come and the road we
must travel to be free of racism and free of intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   But the anniversary of the law should be more than just a time
for reflection, said Michael Dawson, professor at the University of
Chicago and director of the university's center on race and
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   It should be a time for asking about why prejudices and
divisions between blacks and whites still exist more than three
decades after the law gave blacks and whites equal rights at the
polling booths, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have people attacked on the basis of race in Jasper,
Texas and Chicago, Illinois,'' Dawson said. ``The Voting Rights Act
was critical in helping bring blacks into full political
representation; it was crucial to break down the system of
disenfranchisement, but there is still so much to be done.''

MARKET SLUMP DIMINISHING DEMAND FOR NEW ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MARKET, MARKET-ASSESS, MARKET-SMALL-INVESTOR,
MARKET-ACAMPORA.) 
(JT) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON and JOSEPH KAHN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even if stock prices climb out of their trough, one
powerful stimulant of the long bull market will be hard to revive:
the market for new issues.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the market for initial public offerings is shaping up
to be the worst since 1990, when there was a sharp downturn in
stocks. So far this year, the average initial offering has gained a
paltry 3.4 percent, with most prices falling off sharply after an
early surge on their first day of trading, according to Securities
Data Co.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the choppy market has caused underwriters to pull the
plug on several new issues, including planned listings for
Overnight, the trucking arm of Union Pacific; Del Monte, the canned
fruit and vegetable company, and a spinoff of the
telecommunications arm of Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very treacherous time for new issues,'' said
Kathleen Smith, portfolio manager for the Renaissance IPO Fund.
``Investors are stepping away from the table because they know the
odds are against them. Lots of planned offerings are just getting
knocked off the calendar.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the slowdown is that the performance of small
stocks has been dismal compared with the blue chips. The Russell
2000 index is down 8.8 percent, compared with an 8.1 percent gain
for the companies that make up the Dow Jones industrial average.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are also more cautious because they are concerned that
some offerings may be too speculative. For example, shares of
Broadcast.com, a provider of broadcast services over the Internet,
ended their first day of trading on July 17 at $62.75 _ more than
two and a half times the planned offering price and one of the
largest first-day premiums in stock market history. But investors
who bought shares of Broadcast.com at that first-day price have
suffered: the shares closed Wednesday at $50, a 20 percent decline.
</P>
<P>
   Internet offerings, however, continue to generate the most
attention, especially a coming one for Geocities, which backers
have compared to Yahoo and Netscape Communications. Geocities,
which is expected to be priced next week by lead underwriter
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., provides its members with personal home pages
on the Web and is one of the most visited sites on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the one the underwriters are watching day to day,''
said Ryan Jacob, director of research at the IPO Value Monitor, an
industry newsletter. Whether the issue comes to market as
scheduled, and whether it is priced higher or lower than analysts
expected, will be a bellwether of the broad health of the market
for new issues.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most anticipated initial offering of the year will
be October's offering of Goldman, Sachs. The private investment
bank voted to go public this year after deciding against such a
move many times in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman officials say they have every intention of beginning the
offering on schedule. But they will face a less certain market. One
of its most highly regarded rivals, Merrill Lynch, has seen its
stock drop 19.8 percent, from a high of $109.125 in July.
</P>
<P>
   While slumping stock prices may further weaken the market for
new issues, they are not expected to derail any deals. Few
institutional investors said they thought recent mergers were
vulnerable at current stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Many stock transactions would be more likely to be renegotiated
rather than scrapped because the deals were done for strategic
reasons. The most likely deal killer would be if an announced
target had stock losses because of disappointments over earnings.
Then a buyer may question the logic of a merger and withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Some deals have already been renegotiated this year because of
falling prices. In May, Baker Hughes Inc. announced it would
acquire Western Atlas Inc. for $5 billion. But a slump in
oil-service stocks caused by low oil prices dragged down Baker's
shares. The companies renegotiated the terms, lowering the value of
the deal to about $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   One deal investors have been watching is the proposed
acquisition of DSC Communications by Alcatel Alsthom SA of France.
The terms of their agreement require that the price of Alcatel's
American depository receipts remain above an average of $37 a
share. On Wednesday, shares closed up $1.625, to $38.8125.

ANGLICAN BISHOPS PASS CONSERVATIVE RESOLUTION ON HOMOSEXUAL

   CANTERBURY, England _ The world's Anglican bishops Wednesday
adopted a resolution rejecting ``homosexual practice as
incompatible with Scripture'' in a major defeat to church liberals.
</P>
<P>
   The statement also opposes church blessings of same-sex unions
and the ordination of sexually active gays as priests.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, adopted at the once-a-decade Lambeth Conference,
was the first statement on homosexuality that Anglican bishops have
ever passed.
</P>
<P>
   However, the resolution is nonbinding.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal American bishops and gay-rights groups insisted that it
will not settle tensions among Episcopalians in the United States,
who disagree on the issues of gay ordination and same-sex
marriages. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The resolution also supports outreach to gays and states that
``all baptized, believing and faithful persons, regardless of
sexual orientation, are full members of the body of Christ.'' It
urges Anglicans to ``listen to the experience of homosexual
people.''
</P>
<P>
   It calls for sexual abstinence for those who are single.
</P>
<P>
   The statement, a more conservative document than many thought
might emerge from the bishops' historic session, was approved
Wednesday on a 526-70 show-of-hands vote. There were 45
abstentions.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution had been backed by an alliance of traditionalist
African and Asian bishops, British evangelical bishops and U.S.
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Claude Payne of the Houston-based Episcopal Diocese of
Texas voted for the resolution, calling it ``a strong positive
statement in line with my own personal beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   He admitted that it will not end U.S. debate on homosexuality
issues. Payne said, however, that diversity of belief is in keeping
with the focus of the Anglican Communion, a confederation of 35
national churches, including the 2.2-million-member Episcopal
Church in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't lose anything in unity, and I think we will come out
of this stronger,'' Payne said.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop John Spong, a liberal leader from Newark, N.J., predicted
that the resolution will place the homosexual issue on the agenda
of Anglican churches worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resolution sought to justify its prejudice by appeals to
the authority of Holy Scripture,'' Spong said. ``That tactic was
employed in the church's attempt to justify slavery, segregation
and apartheid. It failed then. It will surely fail on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Spong issued a statement to gays worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are created in God's image, loved by Jesus Christ just as
you are and called to the fullness of your humanity by the Holy
Spirit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionalist bishops interpreted Wednesday's vote as a return
to biblical authority and a sign of a shift in communion leadership
from declining churches in the West to growing churches in Africa
and the East. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Several African bishops said that homosexual tolerance in the
communion would destroy Christian churches in their countries. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Bishop Michael Lugor of Sudan said founders of the Sudanese
Christian church ``would laugh at us'' if they could rise from
their graves. ``We know nothing of homosexuality in the Sudan,'' he
said. ``We know only the Gospel.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Alexander Malik of Pakistan said that ``homosexuals
betray the cause of Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Opposing homosexuality,'' he said, ``is not gay-bashing. It is
a matter of faith, doctrine and dogma.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop James Stanton of Dallas, a conservative strategist,
called the vote ``a victory for the Gospels and the Anglican
faith.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Anglican Communion upholds biblical Christian teaching on
sexuality, and this is good news for the American church and for
our ministry in American society,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton said the statement may move many communion members from
a neutral or centrist position on the issue. Many U.S. bishops _
along with church leaders in Australia, Britain, Canada and New
Zealand _ accept homosexual practices.
</P>
<P>
   Obvious tension preceded the bishops' 2 1/2-hour debate on the
campus of the University of Kent.
</P>
<P>
   African bishops had warned that a weak or neutral resolution on
homosexuality would lead to schism.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerian Bishop Emmanuel Chukwuma engaged in angry exchanges
with another bishop and a gay-rights leader outside the doors
leading to the room where the plenary session was held. Security
officers guarded the entrance, but the large numbers of people who
had been expected to protest on both sides of the debate did not
materialize.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Duncan Buchanan of South Africa introduced the resolution
to the assembly and urged its support for the sake of the
communion's unity.
</P>
<P>
   African bishops and their allies immediately set out to make the
resolution even more conservative by offering several amendments.
Archbishop Donald Mtetemela of Tanzania successfully inserted the
phrase that bishops were rejecting ``homosexual practice as
incompatible with Scripture.''
</P>
<P>
   Several other resolutions were considered and rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop George Carey, titular leader of the communion, helped
the conservatives' cause with a brief address prior to the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand wholeheartedly with traditional Anglican orthodoxy,
see no room in Holy Scripture or the entire Christian tradition for
any sexual activity outside matrimony of husband and wife,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The strong vote in favor of the resolution stunned liberals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am terribly disappointed,'' said Bishop Catherine Raskom of
New York. ``In its current form, it is not acceptable to me and my
colleagues.''

&HT;        HOUSE APPROVES STATE REGULATION OF FEDS
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Jason Lakin  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Aug. 5 -- After a heated debate touching on personal
tales of rogue investigations, the House overwhelmingly approved an
amendment drafted by two Pennsylvania lawmakers that would hold
federal prosecutors accountable to state ethics codes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rise up and show the prosecutors that are out of control --
not all prosecutors, just the ones that are out of control -- that
they need some clear oversight,'' said Rep. John Murtha,
R-Johnstown, once investigated and cleared in the 1980 Abscam
scandal. ``They have tremendous power in this country to withhold
the rights of individuals.'' In a 345-82 vote, the House accepted
the amendment, known as the Citizens Protection Act, as part of a
broader spending bill for the Justice Department and other
agencies. The debate on Murtha's bill turned somewhat partisan when
Democrats successfully attached a provision that would also put
independent counsels under the ethics codes, a clear shot across
the bow at Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Murtha's act would establish an independent review board to
which citizens could appeal if they felt that federal prosecutors
abused their powers in the process of conducting their
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Murtha co-sponsored the act with Rep. Joseph McDade, R-Scranton,
who was the subject of a federal bribery investigation by the U.S.
Attorney's Office in Philadelphia. Although McDade was acquitted in
1996, he retold House members of what he claims were tactics of
intimidation and harassment by federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department so strongly opposes the act that it has
advised President Clinton to veto the entire bill if the act
passes.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers said that the McDade-Murtha act would
undermine the ability of federal prosecutors to conduct multi-state
investigations, such as the Oklahoma City bombing, according to
Gregory King, director of Special Projects for the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would significantly hamper federal investigations and
prosecutors ... requiring federal attorneys to subject their
investigations and prosecutors to the haphazard patchwork of 50
sets of rules,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   King particularly objects to a rule in some state ethics codes
that prohibit federal prosecutors from speaking directly to persons
who are represented by a defense attorney. According to King, this
rule may undermine federal investigations of organized crime
syndicates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say we're doing an inter-state organized crime
investigation,'' he said. ``Say the attorney for the organized
crime syndicate claimed to represent the entire organization. That
would prevent us from talking to an underling...an informant.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say the federal prosecutors are held accountable for
their actions by an internal review board at Justice. ``What I want
to prevent is the handcuffing of our prosecutors by requiring them
to submit to various state regulations,'' said Rep. Ed Bryant,
R-Tenn., a former federal prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   But Murtha denounced his critics, particularly the Justice
Department, saying that they simply want to avoid accountability.
And McDade said that the internal Justice review is not strict
enough, pointing to one case where prosecutors received just a
five-day suspension for encouraging perjury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a ploy by the prosecutors to continue their
unethical conduct without any regard for the public,'' said Murtha,
close friend of McDade's. Both longtime members of the House
Appropriations Committee, Murtha and McDade passed a bill last year
that requires Justice to reimburse lawyers fees for suspects found
not guilty in federal cases.
</P>
<P>
   Murtha still faces significant opposition in the Senate. All but
five members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have signed a letter
to the Senate Appropriations Committee attacking the Murtha Act,
claiming that it would hamstring federal investigations.

Biggio's streak halted at 494 games
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
MIAMI _ Long after Larry Dierker has forgotten the details of
Wednesday's loss to the Florida Marlins and long after the sting of
the defeat is gone, the Astros manager will remember one milestone.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be a good memory.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since July 31, 1995, second baseman Craig
Biggio did not play in a regular-season game. His club-record
streak was stopped at 494 games. Only Baltimore's Cal Ripken Jr.
(2,590 consecutive games) has been more of an iron man than Biggio.
Albert Belle of the Chicago White Sox is now second to Ripken among
active players with 283 consecutive games through Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the hardest part about losing this game,'' Dierker
said. ``We'll win our share of games, but the worst part for me is
that we won't be able to get that back. It takes a long time to
build a streak like that.''
</P>
<P>
   On a hot and humid day at Pro Player Stadium, Dierker decided to
keep Biggio out of the starting lineup for only the sixth time this
season. Because the Astros have an off day today, Dierker viewed it
as an opportunity to give Biggio two days to rest his body before
the Astros begin a three-game series against the Phillies Friday at
the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   The fact Biggio wasn't in the lineup didn't raise a red flag,
because Dierker always has managed to get him into the game and
keep the steak alive. Now, the count is back to zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just have to start up another,'' said Biggio, who was
diplomatic about the streak's death. ``I take pride in playing
every day, but this was just one of those days when it wasn't meant
to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Those wishing to second-guess Dierker should keep in mind that
Biggio and catcher Brad Ausmus were his only righthanded pinch
hitters after Derek Bell entered the game for the injured Carl
Everett in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Ausmus pinch-hit for relief pitcher Jay Powell with two out and
no one on base in the seventh inning. One could argue Biggio could
have been used to hit in that spot or in the previous spot, which
was occupied by Tim Bogar, who started in Biggio's place. Biggio
also could have hit for Ricky Gutierrez in the seventh, with Bogar
shifting to shortstop and Biggio remaining in the game at second
base.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a hard game to manage,'' Dierker said. ``I could
not have imagined a scenario where we'd lose a game and I wouldn't
find a way to get him in. I figured any game we were behind, I'd
find a spot to use him. You almost have to a devise a scenario
where you wouldn't use him. Ninety-nine games out of 100, he's
going to get into that game.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Biggio, the odds caught up to him Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   His chances of entering the game as a hitter tailed off after
the seventh inning when the Astros were due to send Bell, Jeff
Bagwell, Moises Alou, Richard Hidalgo, Sean Berry and Tony Eusebio
to the plate over the final two innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had good hitters coming up one after another,'' Dierker
said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the easiest way to keep Biggio's streak alive would
have been to insert him as a defensive replacement for Bogar in the
bottom of the eighth inning. Bogar was due to hit fourth in the top
of the ninth, and Biggio was likely to pinch-hit in that spot
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say it doesn't bother me,'' Biggio said. ``I
guess the opportunity just never presented itself. But the main
thing we're here to do is win games, not keep streaks alive. We're
not here for individual goals and numbers. We're here to win games,
and we didn't win (Wednesday). I'm more disappointed about that
than I am about the streak. Like I said, it just wasn't meant to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   The feeling in Baltimore is if Ripken's streak ever ended, he
would be inclined to take full days off. As far as Biggio is
concerned, don't even think about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't change the way I approach the game,'' he said.
``I'm always going to want to play every day.''

will be the company to beat. By David Einstein

IBM Rumor Boosts Sun Micro's Shares 
 
By David Einstein Shares of Sun Microsystems jumped nearly 10 percent during trading
yesterday on a rumor that the company may be acquired by giant IBM
Corp. _ a deal that could top $20 billion.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The scuttlebutt adds some spice to what has been a rather dull
summer for high-tech news. However, most analysts downplayed the
possibility of such a deal, saying that Mountain View-based Sun is
doing too well to be considered a takeover candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Both Sun and IBM declined to comment on rumors as a matter of
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Sun's shares rose as much as $4.32 in midday trading. But the
rumor lost steam in the afternoon, and the stock ended the day with
a gain of just $2.38, at $47.81.
</P>
<P>
   Based on that price, Sun has a market value of a little over $18
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sun's stock is not considered overpriced _ it trades at 23 times
earnings, about average for big computer-makers. Yet the company
probably could command a premium in a buyout, reflecting the fact
that it has posted record financial results for three straight
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, with annual revenue of $78 billion _ more than 10 times
Sun's sales _ probably would not let price stand in the way of a
merger it really wanted. ``They have significant financial
flexibility so Sun probably would not be difficult for them to
digest,'' said Collins &AMP; Co. analyst Bruce Raabe.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, a deal makes sense from IBM's point of view. Coming
off a second quarter in which its revenues from computer hardware
dropped 13 percent, Big Blue could use a shot in the arm that Sun's
hot servers and workstations could provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sun probably would complement many of IBM's products,'' said
Raabe.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's hard to see what Sun would gain from a merger.
``If I was Sun I'd have no reason to sell,'' said David Wu of ABN
AMRO Chicago Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it seems unlikely that Sun co-founder and chief
executive Scott McNealy would willingly relinquish the spotlight.
``Can you imagine him working for someone else?'' asked Wu. ``I
don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   A merger also might result in a muddle of technologies, adding
products based on Sun's Solaris operating system and Sparc chips to
IBM's lineup, which uses Intel and PowerPC chips and several
different operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, IBM and Sun yesterday introduced an operating
system they developed for businesses. Based on Sun's Java
programming language, the new Java OS for Business is designed for
networks employing slimmed-down ``network computers'' and other
``thin clients'' such as kiosks, ticket machines and remote
terminals.

 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional Democrats welcomed President Clinton
to Capitol Hill on Wednesday with raucous cheers and standing
ovations. But their public reaction masked a widespread concern
among both Democrats and Republicans that Clinton's personal
affairs, and the unknown outcome of the investigations into them,
have thrown the parties into a state of political uncertainty that
only the president can resolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants to touch this with a 10-foot pole,'' said Rep.
Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., a reliable ally of the president. Said
another Democrat who insisted on anonymity: ``We're scared to
death.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say they are equally chary. Rep. John Boehner of
Ohio, the third-ranking Republican, said he told his colleagues at
a meeting Wednesday morning that the uncertainty over the president
undermined their ability to set their re-election strategies. ``We
said, `When you get back in the fall, things could look a lot
different,''' he said. ``You can't do any planning for what
September and October will look like with all this hanging out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of both parties have at least one thing in common: they
are mightily relieved at the thought of leaving this week and being
out of Washington on Aug. 17, when Clinton is scheduled to testify
to a grand jury about Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern
whose lawyers have said she was sexually involved with him.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the August recess will be over in September. And many
in Congress expect that, by then, they will have to deal with a
report from Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, on top of an array
of other highly charged political issues that must be resolved
before they leave again in October to campaign for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats may contend that the public back home is not
interested, but it is clear that the Lewinsky matter has
overshadowed everything else in official Washington. It has become
entwined with the political posturing of both parties as they
attempt to settle the must-pass spending bills before the new
fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fear of the unknown is very difficult to deal with, going into
an election,'' said an aide to a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The president has repeated his threats of vetoing several of the
spending bills to the point where Republicans are now saying that
these threats, and his implication that the Republicans want to
shut down the government again, are his way of trying to distract
everyone from his own political woes.
</P>
<P>
   For many members of both parties on Capitol Hill, Ms. Lewinsky
is a subject to be avoided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know the facts,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis. ``Until
I do, I keep an open mind and a shut mouth. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich will not discuss the matter, his
spokeswoman said. Earlier this year, he said Republicans should
keep mum. Then in April he accused the president of ``the most
systematic, deliberate obstruction of justice in American history''
and said he would mention the president's behavior, which he called
a ``crime,'' in every speech.
</P>
<P>
   But he has fallen silent again, a strategy that members of both
parties suggest is motivated by the axiom: when your enemies are
hurting themselves, don't get in the way.
</P>

<P>
   Clinton still has his staunch defenders, like Rangel. While
saying that he finds the whole matter too embarrassingly personal
to discuss, the Harlem Democrat declares that there is ``not one
scintilla of real evidence'' against the president and that the
matter ``hasn't hurt us so far.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone has been quiet. ``Some of the older members are
telling us, `Get ready for the two most exciting months of your
political life,''' said Rep. Bart Stupak, a third-term Democrat
from Michigan. Still, Stupak said he could do without such
excitement. He said he hopes Clinton will address the nation on the
nature of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. ``The sooner he gets
it over with, the better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a growing distraction,'' said Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va.
``It's sapping creative energy that could be directed to more
important things.''
</P>
<P>
   A top Democratic aide said that members were frustrated that the
Lewinsky matter was preoccupying the news coverage from Washington
to such a degree that they could not get attention for their
re-election campaigns. He said that Democratic leaders sent out an
e-mail message advising members that since the national press ``is
interested only in Monica,'' to make sure local reporters are
invited to their events.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing else on members' minds,'' said the aide, who
said his boss was reluctant to go on television talk shows for fear
of being put on the spot about the president. ``They don't believe
Clinton, but they can't say that,'' he said. ``They are desperate
for him to do a mea culpa; that would get them off the hook.''
</P>
<P>
   Many members of Congress said they felt that Clinton's decision
to testify to the grand jury had signaled that he had not been
completely truthful so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're reserving judgment,'' said Boehner. ``But people are
assuming he's guilty. If he weren't, why has he not said a word in
eight months?''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., a member of the Judiciary Committee,
the port of entry to the House for any report from Starr, said he
was prepared to vote to impeach the president. ``I would vote for
impeachment if he lied under oath in any court proceeding,''
McCollum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting untenable to stand by him,'' said a Democratic
aide to a member who has publicly supported the president.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats said that the Republicans' deepest concern was
that impeachment of Clinton could elevate Vice President Al Gore
and give him a jump on the presidential race of 2000.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Republicans insisted they were not sure if the
investigation would accrue to their political advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mike Castle, R-Del., said the early Republican reading was
that ``it's not politically helpful, and we're not making an issue
of it.'' He added: ``Not more than a handful of members are looking
forward to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., said that while there ``are some
Clinton-haters here, we are Americans first and there is no sense
of glee here.'' He said a number of members were relieved at the
idea of ``being able to hand it off to the Judiciary Committee. We
just don't know the political ramifications.''
</P>
<P>
   Said an aide to a top Republican: ``Republicans understand the
depth of meaning associated with the word `impeachment,' ''
recalling the Democratic landslide win in the House in 1974 after
President Richard Nixon resigned under threat of impeachment. ``At
this stage, the political handicappers wouldn't say it's a big
political plus for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Some said they are just saddened. Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, said,
``It's demeaning,'' adding that this was a time when America was
resurgent as a global power, ``but our political system is
revealing weaknesses to everyone around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Clinton has remained his party's singularly
best money-raiser, and many Democrats are eager to share in the
wealth he generates. At Wednesday's meeting on Capitol Hill, he
reminded Democrats that he would be raising money for their
re-elections.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the meeting mentioned Clinton's pending testimony or
asked for an accounting from him. Afterward, Rep. Elijah Cummings,
D-Md., said it was ``not appropriate'' to bring up Ms. Lewinsky at
what was essentially a strategy meeting. But he added that
Democrats were in ``a wait-and-see pattern'' until Clinton
testifies. ``One thing that was said in there was that this
president has raised more money than any other,'' Cummings noted.
Indeed, tonight he is the star attraction at a reception that is
expected to bring Democrats more than $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Some gushed after his appearance. ``He looked great,'' said Rep.
Nita Lowey, D-N.Y. ``He seemed in terrific shape, he gave a superb
speech, and just what was most evident was how focused he was and
how determined he was to talk about the agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., was one of many who support the
president but lament what the scandal has done to the culture. ``It
has coarsened the language,'' she said. ``This internet and media
machinery has to be fed on an hourly basis, and the entire country
is consumed in this tawdry mess,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Others have taken a lighter approach. Rep. James Trafficant, a
maverick Democrat from Ohio, was wandering down a House corridor
the other day, singing to himself but within earshot of a reporter:
``If the dress doesn't fit, we must acquit. If it's on the dress,
he must confess.''

 Yahoo's Other Dynamic Duo   By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
   
It doesn't take an HTML programmer to discover that a dynamic duo
is the main reason behind Yahoo's go-go success.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But before another editor slaps photos of ``Chief Yahoos'' Jerry
Yang and David Filo on a magazine cover, ``T.K.'' and ``Sparky''
should get their proper due.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the internal company nicknames, respectively, of Yahoo
Chief Executive Officer Tim Koogle and Chief Operating Officer Jeff
Mallett _ the professional, two-headed management team that is
credited with transforming Yahoo from an Internet search engine
into the World Wide Web's most popular site.
</P>
<P>
   ``T.K. and Jeff deserve a lot of the credit for taking the Yahoo
name and building it into a huge enterprise,'' Yang said. ``It's
easy to have an idea, but hard to make it work.''
</P>
<P>
   To Wall Street, they're simply known as ``the parents'' at
Yahoo. And they look the part. Koogle and Mallett's taste in
Italian silk ties, black turtlenecks and khakis often clash with
the sneakers and T-shirts preferred by Yang, 29, and Filo, 32.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're Yahoo's equivalent of the Wizard of Oz, pulling the
strings from behind the scenes,'' said analyst Andrea Williams of
Volpe Brown Whelan &AMP; Co. in San Francisco. ``Americans are
captivated by the idea of two college kids like Yang and Filo
starting an incredible service. But Jeff and T.K. have turned it
into a business that advertisers and investors understand and
respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Since their arrival in 1995, Koogle and Mallett have molded the
Santa Clara company into an online media powerhouse worth $8
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Through acquisitions, canny marketing and a nimble corporate
strategy, Yahoo has become the preeminent mega-site for free
e-mail, news content, virtual shopping and online searches. It is
also one of the few profitable Net ventures, with earnings of $15
million during the past three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Full Speed Ahead
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Consider it business as usual at Yahoo: the laconic,
guitar-strumming Koogle, 47, and the hyperkinetic, athletic
Mallett, 33, seemingly are forever in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Engines have always played a pivotal role in Koogle's life. From
working on them as a 5-year-old with his machinist father in
Alexandria, Va., to overseeing the biggest Internet search engine
of them all, Yahoo, he has been fascinated by the inner workings of
all things mechanical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like building things,'' the soft-spoken Koogle said in an
interview in Yahoo's ``Cowardly Lion'' conference room. ``It's very
neat and fulfilling to create a tangible thing like a company in a
thriving industry like the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The lanky Koogle knows from first-hand experience: He rebuilt
engines and restored cars to help put himself through engineering
school at the University of Virginia and Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Stanford, he worked at Motorola and
InterMec, a Seattle-based company that invented bar-code symbols,
before hooking up with Yang and Filo, the Stanford graduate
students who started Yahoo from a &UR;  &LR; campus office they shared in the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Employing a self-described ``zooming in, zooming out''
philosophy, Koogle said he frequently backs away from daily
operations to look at the big picture before moving in closely to
observe the minutiae. (Not surprisingly, Koogle's doctoral thesis
was on kinematics, a branch of mechanics involving motion.)
</P>
<P>
   Finding His Sidekick
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  When Koogle joined Yahoo in 1995, he immediately set his
sights on hiring Mallett, a former member of the Canadian national
soccer team who cut his teeth in marketing at Reference Software
and WordPerfect.
</P>
<P>
   Like Koogle, Mallett likes moving fast. As an 18-year-old
midfielder, he was a small, scrappy playmaker who careened all over
the field.
</P>
<P>
   By 22, he was running sales, marketing and business development
at his parents' small telecommunications company, Island Pacific
Telephone in his native Vancouver. The company was eventually sold
to telecom giant Cable &AMP; Wireless Plc.
</P>
<P>
   At Yahoo, Mallett is responsible for day-to-day operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say I run things like I played soccer _ with a lot of
energy and purpose,'' said Mallett, who traveled to France in July
to watch the World Cup soccer tournament. ``I like to get involved
in everything. I'm a dying breed in a high-risk profession: I'm a
generalist.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Yang and Filo are inextricably linked with Yahoo in the
public eye, Koogle and Mallett are just as well-known within the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Koogle plays guitar in the company's house band, ``Entertainment
People,'' which is named after a subcategory on Yahoo's online
directory. The guitar is significant because, until recently, it
was about the only thing he owned.
</P>
<P>
   Koogle, who is single, rented a one-bedroom apartment on the
Peninsula until March, when he bought a home in Saratoga. ``I just
don't own a lot of things,'' he shrugged. ``My late parents taught
me you don't need to buy a lot of things to be happy. What's
important is family.''
</P>
<P>
   Mallett, who married at 21, is a bit of an anachronism at Yahoo,
where many of the 600 employees are either single or married with
no kids. He lives in a modest ranch-style home in Ladera with his
wife and two daughters, and said his goal is ``to be on the cover
of Parents magazine rather than Fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are on the professional track here, but I want
to be the best dad possible too,'' said Mallett, whose workplace is
decorated with ``priceless art'' created by his daughters. ``It
means a great deal to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Decision by Committee
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Despite differences in size and demeanor, Koogle and Mallett
have formed a tight working relationship _ right down to their
seating arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Their cubicles are side-by-side, and within earshot of Yang.
(Filo is a two-minute walk away on the Yahoo campus.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so close to one another we can overhear each others'
phone calls,'' Mallett joked. ``It saves us time from having to
repeat conversations.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive close quarters allow the so-called Three
Musketeers to hash out a constant fountain of ideas. ``I'm usually
the pragmatic one, Jerry is the untethered &UR;  &LR; one &UR;  &LR; and T.K. makes the
final call,'' Mallett said. ``I just know we are always thinking
about and anticipating our next moves.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Yahoo's culture is as fast-paced as some of the Formula
I cars that Koogle races around the San Jose Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``You simply can't stand by idly and evaluate too long because
the Internet industry changes so quickly,'' Koogle said. ``Whenever
we consider a deal, I always ask, `Will this speed us up or slow us
down?' ''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Mallett describes the company's fifth-gear philosophy as one
of ``no moss growing under our feet.''
</P>
<P>
   And, evidently, worrying is an important component also,
according to both.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a healthy dose of paranoia,'' Koogle said. ``We will
never discount Microsoft, the big media companies or anyone else.
It was arrogance that led to several companies being steamrolled by
Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Mallett, ``(Disney CEO Michael) Eisner, (NBC head Jack)
Welch and (Microsoft CEO Bill) Gates are moving directly into our
space. That's a daunting challenge, but we have built critical
mass.''
</P>
<P>
   Both have reason to worry.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo faces stiff competition in one corner from America Online,
Netscape Communications and Microsoft _  &UR; all &LR;  have the financial
clout to launch a prolonged battle _ and from Excite in the other.
The critically acclaimed service is on Yahoo's heels in viewership.
</P>
<P>
   But Yahoo has several factors in its favor _ namely, its
remarkable brand-name recognition and its status as the ultra-hip
Silicon Valley startup.
</P>
<P>
   Company legend alternately has it that the inspiration for the
Yahoo name came from the acronym Yet Another Horrifically Officious
Oracle; the unruly ruffians from the book ``Gulliver's Travels'';
or Filo's father, who called him a ``little Yahoo'' during his
childhood in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its origin, the name works and has spawned the
feel-good vibes that worked at previous high-tech wunderkinds such
as Apple Computer and Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Winning Combo
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Industry analysts said the Koogle-Mallett partnership has been
a winning combination that has maintained Yahoo's momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of vision, branding and execution, it's hard to fault
Yahoo,'' said analyst Keith Benjamin, of Robertson Stephens in San
Francisco. ``They have created one of the two most well-known
Internet-related companies, next to AOL.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have done a good job building the initial phase of this
industry,'' said Harry Motro, CEO of rival Infoseek. ``Anybody
running these companies is performing a Herculean task.''
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing Koogle and Mallett aren't in a hurry to do
is jump to another company. Both said the challenge of harnessing
the Net's explosive growth is enough incentive to keep them onboard
for the long term.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was at Motorola, a group of Chinese engineers
demonstrated this great software that did as much as technology we
had spent 100 times more to develop,'' Koogle said. ``We asked
them, `How did you do it?' and they replied: `Because no one told
us we couldn't.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our attitude at Yahoo,'' he said. ``History doesn't
hold us back. No one tells us we can't do something because it
didn't work before.''

 &HT;    Seanez excelling 'out of the blue'
 &HT;    By Michael Lee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Sitting at home in his two-bedroom Omaha apartment
last year, Rudy Seanez had his mind made up after a dismal season
with the Kansas City Royals' Triple-A affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   Seanez was going to give baseball one last try. His
injury-marred career had reached its plateau in frustration and the
game was no longer fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not feeling good, all the time,'' said Seanez, who was
2-5, with a 6.51 ERA in Omaha. ``You can't pitch like that. I
figured, maybe play winter ball, see if I can hook up with another
team, play a year and go from there.''
</P>
<P>
   This season isn't finished, but the way the Braves reliever has
been going, he has no plans of stopping any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old Seanez has a 4-0 record, a 1.69 ERA and has not
allowed any runs in his last 10 games. Right-handed hitters have
simply been at his mercy. Of the 38 righties he faced, 20 have
bowed to the K, and only two have hits off of him, for an anemic
.051 batting average.
</P>
<P>
   If you were wondering if anyone on the Braves is surprised by
these numbers, look no further than manager Bobby Cox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I am,'' Cox said. ``I didn't know he would be this good.
I honestly didn't. He came out of the blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Seanez signed with the Braves as a six-year free-agent in
December and little was expected of him in spring training, where
he got menial work. But it was enough for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good, started throwing all right,'' Seanez said. ``I
was excited about being here.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for a return to Atlanta. In 16 games at
Richmond, Seanez was 2-0 with a 1.29 ERA and 7 saves. The big
numbers: 33 strikeouts in 21 innings pitched.
</P>
<P>
   Since being called up in May, Seanez has 28 strikeouts in 21 1/3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries have plagued Seanez for most of his career, which began
with Cleveland in 1986. He didn't play the entire 1992 campaign
because of a back disorder and eventually had shoulder surgery in
October of that year.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in this year as opposed to past ones _ no
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's healthy as a horse right now, knock on wood,'' Atlanta
pitching coach Leo Mazzone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to stay healthy for as long as I can and trying to
help out as much as I can,'' Seanez said. ``This (season) is way
more than I expected. Everything's going pretty well, but there's a
lot more work to be done.''

 &HT;    Booker to replace Bradford vs. Oilers
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Ronnie Bradford suited up Wednesday afternoon after
missing 10-straight practices with a strained hamstring, but the
Atlanta Falcons' starting right cornerback won't play in Friday's
preseason opener against Tennessee in the Georgia Dome. Bradford
was limited in Wednesday's 90-minute practice. He went through some
drills, but when the team started hitting, he took off his shoulder
pads and began jogging.
</P>
<P>
   Second-year corner Michael Booker will start in Bradford's spot
against the Oilers, and secondary coach Ron Meeks said that Booker
will play quite a bit.The Falcons are thin at corner, where reserve
Randy Fuller (ankle) also is out and Kwame Ellis has been with the
team just one-and-a-half practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get a good look at Michael, for sure. He may play a
little more than a half,'' Meeks said. ``We're kind of short at
corner right now so I might play (starting left corner) Ray
(Buchanan) more than I normally would. Most of the veteran (DBs)
I'd like to get in a good bit of the first half.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradford looked fine while he was out there Wednesday. ``We just
wanted to loosen him up a little bit,'' Meeks said. ``I anticipate
he should be able to go next week.''
</P>
<P>
   What's next?
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons will practice at 2 p.m. today at the Georgia Dome,
in a light walk-through before tomorrow's preseason opener against
Tennessee. The team will have a light workout at 2 p.m. Saturday in
Suwanee and will be off Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Turning up the heat
</P>
<P>
   The competition for the third wide-receiver spot is getting hot,
with six-year veteran Todd Kinchen and four-year veteran Keith
Crawford _ former Rams teamates _ apparently the top two
candidates. It's conceivable the guy who loses out could be cut, as
third-round draft choice Jammi German and fourth-round draft choice
Tim Dwight stand very good chances of making the team, in addition
to starters Terance Mathis and Tony Martin. Kinchen has rebounded
from a slow start in camp to stand out recently. Crawford hasn't
had as many balls thrown his way.
</P>
<P>
   QB watch
</P>
<P>
   What's going on with the quarterbacks:
</P>
<P>
   Chris Chandler: Threw in drills and worked with the No. 1
offense, although in a limited fashion, as coaches were mixing and
matching personnel. Got more work with the No. 2 line _ and
first-team skill players _ Wednesday than with the No. 1 line.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Graziani: Threw in drills and worked more with the No. 1
line and No. 1 skill players than in any practice yet. Had his best
day throwing. In two-minute drills with the first offense, he hit
his first three passes, a 15-yarder across the middle to tight end
O.J. Santiago, a short curl on the right to Martin and a short ball
over the middle to back Harold Green. Earlier, he made a nice deep
throw to German, and he also found German after scrambling to his
left. Also had holding duties.
</P>
<P>
   Steve DeBerg: Threw in drills, and worked with the No. 1 line
with the No. 2 unit. Did not have his best day. Linebacker Craig
Sauer dropped one DeBerg pass that should have been an
interception, and cornerback Buchanan picked off a ball that was
forced into traffic. Also had holding duties.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Brennan: Threw only in drills.
</P>
<P>
   The good, bad and ugly
</P>
<P>
   The good: In passing drills withQBs, receivers, and DBs only,
DeBerg snapped a hard throw over the middle, where rookie
free-agent receiver Corey Allen jumped high to pull it in for a
10-yard TD in front of corner Lenny McGill.
</P>
<P>
   The bad: At the end of practice, backup kicker David Akers
needed five tries to hit a 44-yard field goal against a half-speed
rush.
</P>
<P>
   The ugly: On an attempted screen play, DeBerg hit backup left
guard Bob Hallen in the rear end.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know?
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the collective-bargaining agreement, rookies
are entitled to $100,000 coverage in life insurance. Veterans'
coverage is increased by $20,000 for every credited season _ a
credited season is three games dressed _ up to a maximum of
$200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Aches and pains
</P>
<P>
   Five Falcons missed practice, and none will play Friday: DE
Barry Mitchell (quadriceps), LB Ruffin Hamilton (hamstring), RT
Corey Louchiey (groin), CB Randy Fuller (ankle), and DT Mark
Campbell (knee). Campbell suffered a fairly serious sprain of the
medial collateral ligament of his left knee earlier this week. New
additions to the injured list: WR Tim Dwight (back spasms), DE
Antonio Edwards (back) and DT William Gaines (back). The Oilers
also are dinged up. Starting right CB Darryll Lewis (hamstring)
will not play, and second-round draft choice Samari Rolle of
Florida State will get the start. FS Marcus Robinson (hamstring) is
questionable, as are reserve DT Joe Salave'a, reserve DE Kendrick
Burton, nickel back Steve Jackson and reserve DT Bryant Mitchell.

   New face?
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons worked out 6-foot-6, 283-pound defensive end
Fernando Davis, recently waived by Minnesota. The five-year veteran
had 57 tackles and four sacks last year, when he did not dress for
four games and missed parts of several others with injuries. He
also had 9.5 sacks in '96, but last month he underwent hernia
surgery. Several teams have inquired about Davis, who won't be able
to practice for at least 10 more days.
</P>
<P>
   New player
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are not close to making a decision on the site of
next year's training camp if construction in Suwanee forces a move.
But there is a new player in that game. Today, Tommy Nobis, the
Falcons' vice president for corporate development, who is in charge
of the search, will visit with University of Tennessee-Chattanooga
officials. Furman University in Greenville, S.C., is probably still
the leader in the race, with Middle Georgia College in Cochran also
a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Do-re-me-fa-so-la-ti-do
</P>
<P>
   Backup defensive tackle Esera Tuaolo, who has a CD out entitled
``One Man's Island,'' will sing the national anthem Friday. The
native of Waimanalo, Hawaii, was featured on an NFL Country CD
released in '96.
</P>
<P>
   Hello again
</P>
<P>
   There were a few new old faces in Suwanee on Wednesday as
broadcaster/author Tim Green and rookie broadcaster Elbert Shelly,
both former Falcons, were at practice. Green, a Falcons linebacker
and end 1986-'93, will team with Jeff Hullinger to call preseason
games on WGST radio and WAGA TV. Shelly, an Atlanta safety and
special-teams ace '87-'96, will be the sideline reporter in the
preseason.

   On April 6, 1994, Bill Gates summoned 20 employees of Microsoft
Corp. to a daylong retreat. The gathering included senior
executives and a small group of younger workers who had become
convinced that the Internet would revolutionize the computer
software business.
</P>
<P>
   Gates left no doubt that he agreed with the young evangelists,
even though the Internet was not yet a household term or an
industry. One person who attended the meeting recalled the
Microsoft chairman saying, ``We're going to make a big bet on the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   In its sweeping antitrust suit against Microsoft, the Justice
Department contends that the company's aggressive tactics in
opening its deep pockets and wielding its market muscle in the
Internet software business were intended to protect and expand its
monopoly _ by crushing a new challenger, Netscape Communications
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But in a detailed reply to the government's suit, which must be
filed in federal court no later than Monday, Microsoft will argue
that the 1994 retreat, as well as other Microsoft discussions and
documents dating to late 1993, show that the company's Internet
plans were under way before Netscape rose to challenge Microsoft.
The retreat occurred just two days after the founding of Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft allows that its tactics did eventually hurt Netscape,
but says that was a byproduct of its main intent, which was to
improve its products and benefit consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Few concrete plans were set that day in April 1994 at the
Shumway Mansion, a three-story private residence near Seattle, in
Kirkland, Wash., that had been converted to a conference center.
</P>
<P>
   But several participants say there was agreement on one
strategy: that the Windows operating system, Microsoft's mainstay
product, should have built-in access to the Internet. The concept,
which was then still vague, was referred to variously as an
Internet viewer, interface or browser.
</P>
<P>
   ``People walked away from that April 6 meeting knowing in broad
terms what they had to do,'' recalled J. Allard, who is now general
manager of Microsoft's Internet and data-access unit but then was
the program manager for Internet activities.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, on April 7, 1994, Gates told a group of corporate
executives in Chicago that Microsoft planned to build Internet
access into the next generation of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   It was at the Kirkland gathering, Microsoft says, that it became
a matter of corporate policy to put Internet browsing technology
into Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Justice Department can't be right,'' a senior member of
Microsoft's legal team said this week. ``Netscape wasn't even on
anybody's radar screen back then.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's case, to be sure, does not rest solely on
Microsoft's intentions toward Netscape. The Justice Department says
that Microsoft engaged in a series of illegal practices, including
contracts with personal-computer makers and others that were meant
to thwart competition, and it accuses the company of eventually
trying to persuade Netscape to divide up the market for Internet
browsers _ all of which Microsoft denies.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Justice Department official said this week that
evidence in the government's case showed a pattern of
anti-competitive behavior by a company that was ``simply hellbent
on driving a competitor out of the market.'' Microsoft's defense,
he says, is a ``grand exercise in revisionist history.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's accusation that Microsoft's Internet software
plans were designed not to improve its products or to benefit
consumers but to destroy Netscape provides the context for the
case, a context that seeks to explain Microsoft's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intent is relevant because it provides a road map for the
court to follow,'' said Stephen Axinn, a leading antitrust
litigator in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In court, Microsoft will argue that the Justice Department's
road map is distorted. And interviews with current and former
Microsoft executives and business partners, plus internal documents
from 1993 and 1994, suggest that the company will at least be able
to cast doubt on the government's evidence of intent.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 7, 1993, for example, nearly two years before Microsoft
introduced its Windows 95 operating system, Steven Ballmer, the
company's second in command, sent an e-mail message to his
lieutenants after he had visited Harvard College and observed the
students' use of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Windows 95 was code-named ``Chicago.'' Microsoft,
Ballmer wrote, could ``really help popularize Chicago if we could
say that Chicago is the greatest front-end to the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Brad Silverberg, head of the Windows 95 product
group, replied to Ballmer, ``I see a big opportunity here: Windows
as the gateway to the information highway.''
</P>
<P>
   But the most informed thinking about the Internet was being done
further down in the Microsoft ranks. On Jan. 25, 1994, Allard, who
was then 25, wrote a 16-page memorandum titled ``Windows: The Next
Killer Application on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   In the memo Allard wrote, ``The Internet provides an incredible
opportunity for Microsoft to effectively explore large-scale
networks from many levels: customer needs, technical challenges,
quality-of-service issues, electronic commerce and
information-browsing technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Allard's memo, which was widely circulated within Microsoft,
also said the company should make putting Internet software into
Windows 95 a priority. ``When the next generation of Windows
includes support for standard Internet protocols, the Internet
becomes a natural extension of the Windows end-user experience, and
the favored way to explore.''
</P>
<P>
   Allard emphasized that he was not talking only about putting
internal Internet software in its operating system. Rather, he
wrote, ``Windows becomes the global infostructure explorer.''
</P>
<P>
   A day later, on Jan. 26, 1994, David Pollon, a young product
manager, distributed an 11-page memo titled ``Microsoft and the
Internet: Strategic Direction.'' In it he said that a key goal for
the company was to ``be an innovator in providing the
easiest-to-use Internet interfaces.'' The interface he described
was a primitive concept of a browser, which he argued Microsoft
should make part of its Windows operating system. ``PC users,'' he
wrote, ``will adopt Windows as their easy-to-use interface to the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Netscape had not yet been founded and thus was not mentioned in
either of these e-mail memos. But other rivals were mentioned,
including Sun Microsystems and other companies whose hub computers,
or servers, ran on the rival Unix operating system _ the technology
on which Internet pioneers had built its infrastructure and the
favored platform for developing Internet software.

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Sun Refutes Idea of Eclipse By Microsoft  
   
 By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
It seems as if a lot of people don't buy the idea _ posed in a
Chronicle article last month _ that Sun Microsystems faces a
serious threat from Microsoft.
<TEXT>
<P>
   No way, say Sun officials. Not only do they believe that they're
well-positioned to repel any attack from Microsoft, they think that
as corporate computing relies increasingly on the Internet, Sun,
with its powerful computer servers and Java programming language,
will be the company to beat.
</P>
<P>
   Sun sees no disadvantage in the fact that its computers use
Sun's own chips and operating system rather than the ``industry
standard'' combination of Windows NT and Intel Pentiums. In fact,
the Mountain View company boasts that its Unix operating system,
called Solaris, is faster and far more reliable than Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft wants Windows NT to be the operating system of choice
everywhere inside a big company _ running Intel-based servers in
workgroups, departments and even entire networks. In other words,
it is targeting Sun's main markets.
</P>
<P>
   Windows NT 4.0 has been a stunning success in department and
workgroup situations. But it doesn't work reliably on high-end
servers. Microsoft hopes to conquer the enterprise market with
Windows NT 5.0, which it plans to ship sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   However, Forrester Research has predicted that the software
giant will be disappointed. The Year 2000 problem and fear of bugs
in the new Windows NT will slow adoption of the software through
2001, a report by Forrester read.
</P>
<P>
   ``By then, NT's enterprise aspirations will be usurped by the
rise of Internet Computing and a new competitive landscape,'' the
report stated.
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, Sun could be in great shape. Analyst Daniel
Kunstler of J.P. Morgan, a staunch Sun booster, said that if Sun
continues the momentum that has brought it three-straight quarters
of record earnings, it could amass an installed customer base that
will make it impervious even to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Sun thinks it's hurting Microsoft more than the other
way around. It believes that its low-end servers are competing well
against powerful PCs armed with Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Sun says a number of big companies including
Fujitsu, Siemens-Nixdorf, Toshiba and NCR have agreed to use an
Intel-based version of Solaris as the operating system for their PC
networks _ dealing a blow to Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   Sun also appears to be having a jolly good time jousting with
IBM and Hewlett-Packard, its main rivals in the Unix market.
According to International Data Corp., Sun shipped more Unix
servers last year than anyone, passing both IBM and HP, which had
been tied for first the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Sun topped the market in both the entry market (systems priced
under $100,000) and the midrange market (systems from $100,000 to
$1 million).
</P>
<P>
   And in its first year selling high-end servers ($1 million and
up), Sun ranked third in shipments, outpacing Silicon Graphics,
which was fourth, and IBM, which was fifth. Sun's Enterprise 10000
server, also known as Starfire, took the market by storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sun has made incredible strides in enterprise computing over
the past few years and really caught competitors by surprise in
1997,'' said Jay Bretzmann, vice president of worldwide systems at
IDC. He said Sun is likely to maintain the momentum this year ``and
will continue to gain share at the expense of its competitors.''

 UNDATED: Internet software.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today, many of Microsoft's rivals fear that it is using its
market power to take over the lucrative market for software that
runs on Internet servers, the powerful computers that individual
users tap into from their desktops to send and receive e-mail, view
World Wide Web pages, transfer files and download audio or video
programming.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's industrial-strength operating system for this market
is Windows NT. Microsoft's practices to increase the use of Windows
NT are not part of the government's antitrust case, but the Justice
Department is investigating them.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in January 1994, based on Pollon's memo, the Windows NT
strategy for the Internet was already taking shape. Among the goals
he recommended was ``supplanting Unix with Windows NT as the
dominant back-end platform for Internet services.''
</P>
<P>
   In the antitrust case, Microsoft is expected to argue that it
certainly did use every means _ every legal means, the company says
_ at its disposal to try to defeat Netscape, the early leader and
its main rival in the browser market.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft will also argue that its powerful push into the
Internet software market _ especially incorporating the Internet
Explorer browser in the operating system _ also made it easier and
less costly for many millions of customers who use Windows-based
personal computers to participate in the global computer network.
</P>
<P>
   And the nation's antitrust laws, Microsoft's lawyers say, are
intended mainly to protect consumers from practices like price
gouging rather than to protect competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The senior Justice Department official says, however, that
Microsoft's version of events ignores some significant details. For
example, he notes that Microsoft did not license the core browser
technology around which it built Internet Explorer until December
1994, eight months after Netscape was founded.
</P>
<P>
   To hasten its entry into the browser market, Microsoft licensed
its early browsing software from Spyglass Inc. of Naperville, Ill.
The first meeting between the two companies was in April 1994,
recalled Douglas Colbeth, the president of Spyglass. In subsequent
meetings later that year, Colbeth said it was becoming clear that
Microsoft felt a sense of urgency about Internet software.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape achieved celebrity more than a year later, in August
1995, when it went public and many of its employees became instant
millionaires thanks to Wall Street's discovery of the Internet. But
within the software industry, Netscape had become known as a hot
start-up in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the attention Netscape was getting clearly prodded
Microsoft and accelerated its timing for some steps, like its
announcement in 1995 that it would give away its browser,'' Colbeth
said. ``But from our earliest discussions with Microsoft, the
message was loud and clear that the browsing functionality was
going to be put into the Windows operating system.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Whenever you license technology to Microsoft, you
have to understand that they may well do it themselves and drop it
into the operating system. That's Microsoft's business model,
expanding Windows.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the legal outcome, the way Microsoft awakened to
the opportunity and threat of the Internet is a textbook case of
the way the company works. A small group of Internet enthusiasts,
mainly in their 20s, got the attention of Microsoft's top
management including Gates.
</P>
<P>
   It helped that one of those young enthusiasts was Steven
Sinofsky, who at the time was a technical assistant to Gates, a job
that Sinofsky described as ``largely just being an extra set of
eyes and ears to learn about the newest, latest technology and
bring it back to Bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinofsky had read Allard's January 1994 memo ``Windows: The Next
Killer Application on the Internet.'' And the two soon got
together. ``It was clear he had already figured this thing out,''
Sinofsky recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Sinofsky and Allard arranged the one-day brainstorming retreat
in April 1994, including handing out a 3-inch-thick pile of advance
reading for every participant, a hefty selection of
Internet-related writings. Much of the discussion focused on how
Microsoft might make money off the Internet and what might be the
big money-making product, or ``killer app,'' in the industry's
shorthand.
</P>
<P>
   Allard's formulation, then and now, was simple _ both a
distillation of Microsoft's overarching strategy and a business
practice that sends shivers of fear through its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no killer app,'' Allard said this week. ``It's just
Windows.''

 &HT;    Suspect, a Rudolph admirer, caught in N.C.
 &HT;    By Knight Chamberlain
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEKIN, N.C._ The search for an accused murderer described as an
Eric Robert Rudolph ``wannabe'' ended Wednesday evening with his
arrest near the Richmond-Montgomery county line.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery County Sheriff Jeff Jordan said James Andrew Finley
Jr., 21, of Hickory, N.C., was captured without incident near the
Mount Gilead Hunting Lodge along N.C. 109.
</P>
<P>
   Finley has been charged in the slaying of Andrew Marston and
Tommi Danielle Byrd, both 24, a Charlotte couple who planned to
marry this fall. They were found shot and slashed to death Sunday
at a campsite in the Linville Gorge Wilderness Area in Burke
County.
</P>
<P>
   As Finley, dressed in green fatigue T-shirt and pants, was led
into the volunteer fire department being used as a command post for
the search, about 100 onlookers broke into applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people around here were really scared,'' said Robert
Hill, who lives in nearby Dry Creek. ``We have a lot of elderly
people, women who live alone. This is a relief for everyone, a big
relief.''
</P>
<P>
   The search for Finley shifted to Montgomery County several miles
to the east after a police chase Monday that led to Marston's
stolen blue Honda Accord abandoned on the edge of the Uwharrie
National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Finley's acquaintances had described him as an admirer
of Rudolph, the North Carolina man who has eluded an intensive
manhunt in the Nantahala National Forest since being accused of the
Jan. 29 bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic. The acquaintances
said Finley, an experienced outdoorsman, bragged that he, too,
could escape capture, according to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   That link to the continuing hunt for Rudolph in the western
North Carolina mountains near Andrews brought dozens of journalists
to this crossroads village to watch a similar band of law
enforcement agents wearing camouflage and toting rifles in the hunt
for Finley.

KOSOVO STRIFE BRINGS U.S. WARNING TO SERBS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also YUGO-KOSOVO) 
(mk) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Faced with a step-up in violence against civilians
in the southern Serbian province of Kosovo and reports of a new
mass grave, the Clinton administration warned President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia Wednesday, in stronger terms than before,
that his tactics are unacceptable and could prompt NATO air strikes
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Senior American officials said the warning was delivered as a
personal message from Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to
Milosevic by an American diplomat, Christopher Hill. They
emphasized that NATO and the Pentagon are working quickly to finish
plans for limited air strikes that could take place, if ordered,
within a week or 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   But since NATO has not carried out any earlier threats over
Kosovo, Milosevic may not take this warning seriously. He already
has accomplished his aim of striking a serious blow to the ethnic
Albanian insurgency in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem of the day is how to be credible,'' said one
senior American official. ``But there is a lot of serious military
planning now going on to create more realistic and flexible ways to
use air power against Serb forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is also likely to have taken heart by the removal from
Kosovo policy of the American special envoy, Robert Gelbard, who
advocated a tough line against the Yugoslav president.
</P>
<P>
   Gelbard was ordered by the White House and Albright to stick to
Bosnia, officials said. They explained the shift by the approach of
important countrywide elections next month in Bosnia, and said too
much of Gelbard's time was being spent on Kosovo and not enough on
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But some officials said Gelbard's shift was also a function of
his sometimes impolitic advocacy of a tough stance toward Milosevic
as the main destructive influence in the region, a stance that
encompassed the threat of force. But the White House has not been
eager to get involved militarily in another part of the Balkans,
its NATO allies are split and some of them want a U.N. Security
Council resolution authorizing any action, which Moscow pledges to
veto.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo policy is now more clearly in the hands of Richard
Holbrooke, the nominee for chief delegate to the United Nations,
and his longtime collaborator, Hill, now the ambassador to
Macedonia. Hill is said to be making some progress with the ethnic
Albanians in establishing a 15-member executive council, under the
titular leadership of Ibrahim Rugova and containing key members of
the Kosovo Liberation Army, that would represent Kosovo in
negotiations with Milosevic for a form of self-government within
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke is known to consider Milosevic, despite all his
faults, as a necessary collaborator to ensure the success of the
Bosnian settlement.
</P>
<P>
   An independent Kosovo, as the ethnic Albanians want and the West
opposes, could undermine the idea of a multiethnic Bosnia within
established borders, and destroy the accord, senior White House
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   That view carries some irony, the officials admit, since Kosovo
was left out of the Dayton talks that settled the Bosnia crisis.
``So few people believed at the time that Dayton would succeed,
Kosovo was seen as a complicating issue and was put aside for
later,'' one official said.

<P>
   American officials say they have Chechnya in mind as a model.
While formally remaining a part of the Russian Federation, the
Chechens fought their way to a political deal with Russia that
gives them effective self-government and control over their own
judiciary, education and security.
</P>
<P>
   But officials acknowledge that Milosevic's campaign of terror
against ethnic Albanians _ burning villages and driving over 10
percent of the population of 2 million people from their homes _
has made it more difficult for Kosovar leaders to agree on a joint
negotiating stance.
</P>
<P>
   Albright is planning a trip to the region at the end of this
month, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Next month's elections ``are a chance to consolidate the gains
in Bosnia, and Gelbard's done a good job in Bosnia,'' another
official said. ``There's a real concern that we're losing focus on
Bosnia, and if the elections go badly we'll be there forever.''

Astros' stance on batting style: whatever works
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARA LaBRIE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Bagwell bows his knees.
</P>
<P>
   Alou stands perfectly still.
</P>
<P>
   Bell has finally settled on something.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio just keeps comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   From a bend in the knee to the motion of the swing, the batting
stance is what makes a baseball player unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``Batting stances are like fingerprints,'' Astros hitting coach
Tom McCraw said. ``It is only important to that individual
hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Astros have among them some of the most individual of
all as they go against the norm in their batting approaches. But it
seems to have paid off. Through Tuesday, the Astros were hitting
.278 as a team _ second in the National League to the Colorado's
Rockies' .285.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell's stance _ peculiar as it may be _ has kept him
comfortable enough to hit .272 with 23 home runs and 72 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very unique,'' McCraw said. ``The most unique that I've
ever seen. I still haven't figured out what makes his batting
stance work. He does everything in reverse of what all hitters
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Most hitters move toward the ball as they begin to swing;
Bagwell strides from the ball. He has a wide base that appears
uncomfortable. As he prepares to swing, he hitches _ tugs _ the bat
downward, usually a no-no for batters.
</P>
<P>
   But even though Bagwell goes against the rules, McCraw doesn't
plan on changing a thing with a lifetime .301 hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I wouldn't coach him to stand as wide as he does,''
McCraw said. ``He has a very wide base and a hitch _ but he gets
out of it in time, and it's OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult when you look at the anatomy of a human
being. Everything is supposed to be fluid _ everything he does is
totally different. Yet he is very successful at what he does, so
you leave that alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell doesn't know where he developed his unusual plate
posture, but he doesn't plan on changing it any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole philosophy is I'm not going to fix something that
isn't broken,'' Bagwell said. ``In this game, you have to make
subtle changes. You don't want to make large changes, because
you're learning something totally different.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of Bagwell's sways and lunges at the plate, Moises Alou
doesn't blink an eye. Alou, whose batting stance is one of relaxed
control, is just as unique as Bagwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alou's very different,'' McCraw said. ``Everything has a
rhythm. All hitting has a rhythm; all hitters have a rhythm. Alou
is one of the very unique people who's dead still.''
</P>
<P>
   While most hitters start their swing by bringing the bat
backward then proceed to swing forward, Alou doesn't. He keeps the
bat even at his shoulders and swings forward with no initial
motion.
</P>
<P>
   And although most wouldn't expect this to produce power, Alou
has shown that to be the contrary, clubbing 28 homers and driving
in 95 runs this year while hitting .297.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different than probably every other hitter you're going
to see,'' McCraw said. ``Whatever he's doing, it looks different,
and it is different. For him, it's successful.''
</P>
<P>
   But some hitters don't have Alou's fortune _ a comfortable
stance that's effective. McCraw helped one Astro, Derek Bell, find
that stance. Bell had no set stance at the plate _ and his hitting
suffered as a result. He opened the 1997 season 19-for-93 (.204)
and finished the year at .276.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, Bell has settled into a stance he is comfortable
with, and it shows. He's hitting .327 with 16 homers and 81 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You change a lot of stances when you're not sure of
yourself,'' McCraw said. ``Bell would give you four different
stances in one at-bat. He'd be wide, he'd be closed, he'd be open
he was all over the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to settle him down and get him in one place, because
when you're in one position, it's easier to make corrections.''
</P>
<P>
   McCraw describes Bell's stance as very basic and low to the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just go out there and feel comfortable,'' Bell said. ``You
have to feel comfortable at the plate so you can see the ball and
hit the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Comfort is certainly the No. 1 factor behind Craig Biggio's
stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitting is very complicated,'' Biggio said. ``You have to have
a plan, approach, stance and mechanics. It works for me; it's
comfortable for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggio's cozy stance has produced a .318 batting average this
year with 12 home runs and 60 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   McCraw describes Biggio's stance as conventional _ the opposite
of teammates Alou and Bagwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very basic to what a lot of guys use,'' McCraw said.
``The mechanics of it are the same; his mechanical approach is
basic to most other hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He steps toward the pitcher. He loads his hands up. There's
nothing unconventional about Biggio.''
</P>
<P>
   Except, of course, the fact Biggio will sacrifice his body more
than the average hitter, often leaning his left arm into a pitch
purposefully. Last year, he was hit a National League-leading 34
times, breaking his club record of 27 set in 1996. This year,
Biggio has been plunked 19 times.
</P>
<P>
   But even though the Astros' four most prominent hitters approach
the plate differently, there is one element that unites them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all have different batting stances, but they're all
successful,'' McCraw said. ``What makes them unique is the mental
concept of hitting. Any successful hitter has the proper mental
approach to hitting: hit off the fastball, use the whole field, and
know the opposing pitcher _ how he gets you out, how he likes to
get you out. Once you learn that, the mechanical part becomes
secondary.''
</P>
<P>
   McCraw says hitting is 95 percent mental _ and that's why
Bagwell can stand so awkwardly and Alou remain motionless yet still
find success at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where most hitters fall short. They go out and work
hours on the physical and don't do anything for the mental side,''
McCraw said. ``The worst thing that a hitting instructor can do is
to try to have everybody hit the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   And as the Astros remain among the best-hitting teams in the
league, McCraw sits back, watches the success at the plate and
smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' he said, ``is where I get my greatest pleasure.''

ADVERTISING: ERNST &AMP; YOUNG PICKS DMB&AMP;B FOR GLOBAL ACCOUNT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By COURTNEY KANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ernst &AMP; Young said Wednesday that it had named D'Arcy
Masius Benton &AMP; Bowles Communications in New York to handle its
account. While the selection of the agency was no surprise, the
amount of business that the shop landed was more than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation that DMB&AMP;B would win Ernst &AMP; Young's domestic
account, with billings estimated at $15 million or less, had
circulated since late last month. But when the decision was
announced, it included the accounting firm's entire worldwide
advertising and branding account, with billings estimated at more
than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a global organization,'' said Philip Laskawy, chairman
and chief executive of Ernst &AMP; Young LLP. ``A global campaign will
help us better communicate the consistent, high caliber of our
work.'' He said it would promote the company's ``seamless, global
integration.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the decision by Ernst &AMP; Young is emblematic of the
ferment in the financial-services field as a growing number of
marketers rethink agency relationships.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two months, for instance, Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. named
J. Walter Thompson Co. in New York, part of WPP Group, to handle
its $85 million worldwide account, while Charles Schwab &AMP; Co.
consolidated its brand advertising, with billings estimated at $50
million, at the BBDO New York unit of Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   Grace &AMP; Rothschild in New York previously handled creative
duties for Ernst &AMP; Young in the United States for two years, while
Grey Advertising in New York previously handled the media services.
The overseas portion of the account was divided among 10 agencies.
Last year, Ernst &AMP; Young spent $6 million to $8 million worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Shern, vice chairwoman for marketing and planning at
Ernst &AMP; Young in New York said, ``It was our plan and hope all
along to select a global agency and to develop a global marketing
strategy.'' She added, ``We selected DMB&AMP;B because of the quality
of their strategic thinking, their creative capability and their
fully integrated communications approach and the team itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shern said that DMB&AMP;B, which is part of MacManus Group, was
awarded the account after a review that began in April when the
accounting, consulting and business advisory company decided to
examine all aspects of the company's business following the failure
of a proposed merger with KPMG Peat Marwick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ended up being a tough choice,'' Ms. Shern said, adding
that DMB&AMP;B ``hit on all parts of our scoring system. We wanted to
engage an agency that would help build the brand for Ernst &AMP;
Young.''
</P>
<P>
   In building the brand, Ms. Shern said Ernst &AMP; Young hoped to
further distinguish itself from competitors like Deloitte &AMP; Touche,
Price Waterhouse Coopers, KPMG Peat Marwick and Andersen
Consulting.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Ernst &AMP; Young acquisition was a delight and a relief for
DMB&AMP;B after a period of shortfalls in other high-profile reviews
including Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're absolutely thrilled,'' John Farrell, president of DMB&AMP;B
North America said. ``It's a terrific compliment to the agency when
a client of this stature puts this level of faith and commitment in
the agency.'' He added, ``Strategically, Ernst &AMP; Young is exactly
the kind of business DMB&AMP;B is best at.''
</P>
<P>
   DMB&AMP;B, with more than 6,000 employees in 126 offices in 74
countries, has billings estimated at $5.8 billion from blue-chip
clients including Procter &AMP; Gamble, General Motors, M&AMP;M Mars and
Coca-Cola. DMB&AMP;B's New York office will serve as the lead office
for the Ernst &AMP; Young global account, which will aim at primary
markets including the United States, Britain, France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The Ernst &AMP; Young acquisition comes on the heels of another
worldwide account gain for the agency. Last week, Avon Products
Inc. in New York expanded its relationship with DMB&AMP;B and its
sibling, N.W. Ayer &AMP; Partners in New York, by consolidating its
worldwide advertising between the two. Those billings were
estimated at more than $65 million.
</P>
<P>
   DMB&AMP;B had been hoping to help compensate for the loss in late
March of a top client, the Gateway computer company, after handling
its worldwide account for only a year. The account, with billings
estimated at $50 million to $70 million, had been one of the 10
largest at DMB&AMP;B.
</P>
<P>
   A new campaign for Ernst &AMP; Young is expected to be introduced in
October. Details about the campaign were not disclosed, except that
it would include a replacement for the company's current theme,
``There isn't a business we can't improve.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ No one professes greater surprise that Toyoo Gyohten was
tapped as a special adviser on financial matters to the new prime
minister, Keizo Obuchi, than Toyoo Gyohten himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had completely migrated to the private sector,''
he said in an interview Wednesday at his office in the Institute
for International Monetary Affairs, a private policy study group,
of which he is president. ``And frankly, I'm not so happy to be
losing the freedom of the private sector, but on thinking it over,
I decided maybe this is something I have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been suggested _ although not by him _ that he will do a
great deal of the traveling required of the Minister of Finance
because the man currently just appointed to that position, Kiichi
Miyazawa, is 78; Gyohten is a relatively spry 67. ``The assignment
is not very specific, I have to confess,'' Gyohten said.
</P>
<P>
   He and Miyazawa have been a team before, when Miyazawa served as
finance minister in the mid-1980s and Gyohten was one of his senior
lieutenants in the bureaucracy, and the two are considered a
winning team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obuchi has the best one-two punch one could imagine in
Miyazawa and Gyohten,'' said Kenneth S. Courtis, chief Asian
economist at Deutsche Bank.
</P>
<P>
   There are high hopes for Gyohten. A world-class financial
architect, he was instrumental in forging the Plaza Accord, a 1985
agreement that helped drive down the dollar's value and consolidate
the yen's position as one of the world's three most important
currencies.
</P>
<P>
   He is known as a man fluent in the befuddling language and
culture of the global financial markets, where Japanese fiscal and
monetary policy is often regarded with something between suspicion
and disdain.
</P>
<P>
   Gyohten rubbed shoulders and cultivated friendships as Japan's
negotiator at meetings of the Group of Seven industrial nations,
where he met Paul A. Volcker, then the Federal Reserve chairman.
</P>
<P>
   His stature is such that he was considered a contender for
Michel Camdessus' job as head of the International Monetary Fund
after he left the Finance Ministry in 1989, where he rose through
the ranks to become the globally influential vice minister of
international finance.
</P>
<P>
   On leaving, he served as chairman of the Bank of Tokyo from 1992
to 1996, helping to orchestrate its merger with Mitsubishi Bank,
and he remains a senior adviser of the institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm reassured in that his appointment will mean there's a
voice of great experience with a direct line to the prime
minister,'' said Robert Alan Feldman, senior economist at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter in Tokyo. ``But you never know with a position
like that whether it's window-dressing or whether he'll have real
clout.''
</P>
<P>
   Gyohten is careful not to overstate his role. ``I am an adviser,
let's make that clear,'' he said in his colloquial English, picked
up at Princeton University where he was a Fulbright scholar in
1956. ``And no one should think that an adviser has decision-making
ability.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he added, ``I don't think I would make that beautiful
of a window-dressing, and anyway I don't think this new
administration can afford to try to hide any dirt'' behind such
cover.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi is regarded as financially naive, and he and his cabinet
have low early popularity ratings. The new agriculture minister,
Shoichi Nakagawa, stuck his foot in his mouth hours after he was
appointed by saying it was not clear that Korean women had been
forced into providing sex to Japanese officers during the war.
</P>
<P>
   And Miyazawa set off a brief run on the yen with an ambiguous
nod to laissez-faire monetary policy that he later had to clarify.
Wednesday, the yen improved, rising in New York to 143.86 to the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Gyohten speaks slowly and thoughtfully, and many believe he will
emerge as the voice of the Obuchi administration on economic and
financial matters. The prime minister seems inclined to leave those
duties in others' hands, and the way he has assembled the team of
Miyazawa, Gyohten and Taichi Sakaiya, a former bureaucrat and
well-known author who is director general of the Economic Planning
Agency, suggests that they will speak in a more unified voice than
past administrations. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Gyohten first met Obuchi many years ago when he was a midlevel
bureaucrat at the Finance Ministry and the future prime minister
was a young Liberal Democratic Party legislator from the provinces.
The two were invited to join a study group formed by a business
leader. ``We met once a month and quite freely discussed almost
anything _ Japanese politics, the economy, the global situation,''
he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He came to know Obuchi as a rather homespun politician and still
marvels at his ability to retain something of a provincial accent
in spite of long years in Tokyo. ``Frankly speaking, he was not _
how shall I say this? _ the type of man to demonstrate his own
cleverness,'' Gyohten said. ``He has always been very modest, but
yet steadfast or stubborn, I don't know which to say, about his
principles.''
</P>
<P>
   The two have been in touch off and on through the years, though
as each went further down his career path, they saw less of each
other, according to Gyohten. Thus, he was quite surprised when
Obuchi called him after he was elected president of the Liberal
Democratic Party and asked him to be his personal adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he needed somebody who can convey accurate, objective
and prompt assessments of what is happening in the global markets
and also, if necessary, to try to communicate with the markets so
the markets will have a better understanding of Japanese politics
and situations,'' Gyohten said.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks the criticism of the Obuchi Cabinet may work to its
advantage. ``Because of the low popularity, the sense of crisis,
the sense of urgency shared by this prime minister and his cabinet
has been enhanced,'' he said. ``All know how difficult and
challenging their job is.''
</P>
<P>
   That sense of urgency, Gyohten added, is what Japan has lacked
the last few years. He ticked off the mistakes and miscalculations
that brought the Japanese economy to its knees _ an increase in the
consumption tax in April 1997, stubborn adherence to fiscal
austerity while the country was sinking into recession, ignorance
of the punishment that global markets can inflict _ and he
suggested they all could have been prevented by a sense of crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is now most important for Obuchi to demonstrate his
decisiveness, his sense of priority and urgency,'' Gyohten said.

TWO TEEN MOTHERS TO SUE OVER HONOR SOCIETY EXPULSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ETHAN BRONNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COVINGTON, Ky. _ Two 17-year-old high school students who say
they were denied membership in the National Honor Society because
they were pregnant are planning to sue their school board in
federal court here on grounds of sexual discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union, which is to file suit for
the girls on Thursday, says it sees the case as a way to seek wider
enforcement of federal laws banning sex discrimination due to
pregnancy in high school.
</P>
<P>
   The two girls, Somer Chipman and Chasity Glass, both 17 and top
students at Grant County High School in nearby Williamstown, are
raising their daughters as they prepare for their senior year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chipman, whose daughter's name is Cheyenne, plans to marry
the father, a 21-year-old worker at an oil-change shop, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Glass lives with her mother with her 15-month-old daughter,
Shelby. The baby's father, who just graduated, helps with child
care and plans to join the National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Both girls, like many residents in their community, a rural,
tobacco-growing area where alcohol sales are banned, say they were
wrong to have engaged in premarital sex but consider abortion a far
greater sin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake,'' Ms. Glass said, bouncing Shelby on her
lap, in the office of a local lawyer. ``It's just that others
haven't gotten caught.''
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyer, Sara Mandelbaum of the ACLU, described the case this
way: ``It's making a girl wear a scarlet P and bear the burden for
something that is a joint activity. No boy is being left out of the
society for having engaged in premarital sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Admission to the National Honor Society, which recognizes
outstanding high school students, is based on national guidelines
but is under the direct authority of local chapters. Boards of
teachers choose members according to scholarship, character,
service and leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chipman, whose grade-point average is 3.9 on a scale of 4.0,
and Ms. Glass, with 3.7, were never officially told why, out of 33
students with the required academic record, they were the only ones
to have been denied entry to the National Honor Society. When they
demanded an explanation, they were simply told that they had not
met the criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Both girls have been exemplary students, earning top marks in
such courses as ``advanced placement'' English and chemistry, and
have won local and state awards. Ms. Chipman and Ms. Glass say
membership in the National Honor Society has been a lifelong goal.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Ruberg, lawyer for the Grant County Board of Education,
said that given the county's conservative nature, denying
membership to the two girls was neither surprising nor
controversial for most residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the fact that character is one of the criteria,'' Ruberg
said by telephone, ``the admissions committee did not feel that
someone who had engaged in premarital sex should be held up as a
role model for the rest of the students to emulate, whether male or
female.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruberg added that if paternity was known, through birth
certificates or lawsuits, boys would also be excluded from
membership in the National Honor Society.
</P>
<P>
   According to the organization's handbook, under ``provisions of
federal law, pregnancy _ whether within or without wedlock _ cannot
be the basis for automatic denial of the right to participate in
any public school activity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It may properly be considered, however, like any other
circumstance, as a factor to be assessed in determining character
as it applies to the National Honor Society,'' the handbook adds.
``But pregnancy may be taken into account in determining character
only if evidence of paternity is similarly regarded.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mandelbaum said it was precisely the fact that boys who
engaged in premarital sex faced no such exclusion that made the
girls' rejection an act of sex discrimination and a violation of
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and the Equal
Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that pregnancy has been an issue in
membership in the National Honor Society. Earlier this year, a girl
in Xenia, Ohio, complained that she had been expelled from her
local chapter after becoming pregnant, said Patricia Scanlon, of
the department of student activities at the National Association of
Secondary School Principals, which oversees the honor society.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, a Pennsylvania girl who was expelled from an honor
society over a pregnancy lost her challenge in federal court, but
in Illinois in 1985, a similar federal lawsuit was successful. Ms.
Scanlon said chapters around the country had allowed pregnant girls
to become members.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Yeager, an editor at The Grant County News, which has a
weekly circulation of 5,000, said letters to the newspaper were
evenly divided in supporting and opposing the honor society.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chipman said she had received numerous letters of
encouragement. Ms. Glass said she also sensed much community
support, adding: ``Times are changing. Not all teen mothers are
stereotypes. I want to be a teacher. I didn't drop out of school.
But I'm not recommending this.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Glass said she hoped to take part in a local committee that
urges the postponing of sexual activity among high school students
and use her own case as an example.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't give up my daughter for the world,'' she said,
``but I want to tell others how expensive it is, how much work it
is. That's how I want to be a role model.''

Tomjanovich nurses U.S. team through growth spurt
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ATHENS, Greece _ It has been 29 days since the United States
brought replacement players together charged with doing a duty that
was originally assigned to NBA players.
</P>
<P>
   And through six games of the FIBA World Championship of
Basketball, it has been interesting to watch this team's birth and
growth into an alive-and-kicking 4-week-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team,'' coach Rudy Tomjanovich says, ``has come a long
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as people grow quickest in their first weeks and months of
life, so has this team taken on a personality in its infant stages.
Many things have become apparent about the collection of
Continental Basketball Association players, American refugees from
Europe, guys looking for work and one player still in college.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most glaring trait of this team is that it is clear
after the first two rounds of play why the 12 roster members are
where they are in their professional careers. There are reasons why
none of them finished last season in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   For some, like Jason Sasser and Jimmy King, it's that they have
blatant holes in their games, shortcomings that get exposed quickly
by more talented NBA players.
</P>
<P>
   For others, like Ashraf Amaya and Kiwane Garris, it's an
inconsistency that keeps them down.
</P>
<P>
   Still others, like Wendell Alexis, Bill Edwards and Gerard King,
have become so adept at the European game that they have lost the
inclination to re-learn the NBA style. Hey, the money in Europe
spends just the same as the money in America. And the lack of taxes
makes up for the higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, this team has been as good as any during the World
Championship, despite all the shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not the Dream Team, it's true,'' says Jimmy Oliver, the
jump-shooting artist with perhaps the best chance of getting back
into the NBA next season. ``But we still have some of the best
players from America on this team.''
</P>
<P>
   During the past month, this team has developed many of the same
characteristics of NBA teams, which is not so surprising since its
coach has been molding quality Rockets teams for six years.
</P>
<P>
   Like many NBA teams (especially the Rockets), the Americans have
an infatuation with the 3-point line. They launch more than 30
percent of their shots from beyond the arc. They also are a faulty
free-throw shooting team _ another similarity to NBA clubs.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the Americans will go into the quarterfinals Friday
with a 5-1 record and the No. 1 seed out of Group F. They will play
Italy, the fourth-place team in Group E. The winner of that game
goes into the semifinals, also known as the medal round.
</P>
<P>
   The loser of that game can finish no better than fifth in the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   It's the pivotal game of the entire World Championship for every
team. Win, and there's a three-in-four chance of getting a medal.
Lose, and there is no chance of a medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody can be 6-0 or 5-1 in a tournament like this and if
you lose the next game, you're out of the medal round,'' Oliver
said. ``We've got to work even harder than we have so far.''
</P>
<P>
   The parity of the World Championship has exceeded everybody's
expectations. Without the NBA players, more drama was expected. But
when Italy upset Yugoslavia on Monday, it proved that there were no
fewer than nine teams (the United States, Australia, Argentina,
Lithuania, Spain, Russia, Greece, Italy and Yugoslavia) that could
legitimately say they had a shot at a medal, perhaps even the gold.
Australia was later eliminated by the United States from medal
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Some would say this is a great mixture of global basketball
competition. Others would say it's a testimonial to the mediocrity
of the game outside the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the tournament has been entertaining throughout. And
it has included some spicy elements that aren't always front and
center. Here are a few of the interesting sidelights after the
first two rounds of the tournament:
</P>
<P>
   Whining about referees translates into any language. The South
Korean and Brazilian coaches jump up and down, rant and rave and
basically act like any other Mike Dunleavy or John Calipari griping
at refs.
</P>
<P>
   Without the Dream Team, attendance for the World Championship
has been horrible. The tournament is being played at Olympic
Stadium and the Peace and Friendship Stadium. The Greek team has
drawn capacity crowds every night. But since the Dream Team was
expected in Greece, it was scheduled at the opposite venue every
night from the Greek team. Since no NBA players showed up to carry
the load at the other venue, crowds at games not played at the
stadium at which Greece was playing have been minuscule.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's Scott Fisher has the best postgame highlight show in
the tournament. After any Aussie win, he takes off and does a swan
dive, skidding on his belly across the floor as far as he can, much
to the delight of Aussie fans.
</P>
<P>
   Just like the NBA, nobody in this match can shoot free throws
under pressure, either.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly for the United States, they still seem to have
the emotional hammer in the tournament. They are, after all,
replacement players. And they also have the best motivator going in
Tomjanovich. ``Us coming out not focused in that Lithuanian game
was a lesson that was costly,'' Tomjanovich said of the only U.S.
loss. ``But it didn't affect us. We still wound up where we needed
to be, with the top seed.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's just a matter of whether they can capitalize on it
Friday.

LEWINSKY TO MAKE GRAND JURY APPEARANCE THURSDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES   AND CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Monica S. Lewinsky, the former White House intern
at the center of sex and coverup allegations involving the
president, is expected to make her long-awaited appearance Thursday
before a federal grand jury, a source close to Lewinsky said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Barring last-minute changes to the grand jury schedule, Lewinsky
is set to appear at US District Courthouse, where she has been
preceded by a parade of witnesses over the past six months, from
her distraught mother to a college classmate flown in from Tokyo to
a former colleague who had triggered the investigation by secretly
taping conversations with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's testimony, which some predict could be wrapped up in
a day or two, is critical to independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr's
investigation of whether President Clinton had a sexual
relationship with Lewinsky and encouraged her to lie about it.
Clinton, who has denied having had such a relationship, will
testify for the grand jury on Aug. 17 via closed-circuit television
from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's appearance, which she has been preparing with lawyers
from Starr's office, would come nine days after she was granted
immunity in exchange for her ``full and complete testimony.''
Lewinsky's mother, Marcia Lewis, also received immunity.
</P>
<P>
   In her testimony, Lewinsky is expected to contradict an earlier
sworn affidavit and say she had a sexual relationship with Clinton.
Lewinsky is also expected to tell grand jurors she does not believe
that Clinton encouraged her to lie under oath, though they explored
ways to keep the relationship secret.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Barry Toiv Wednesday downplayed any
concern among aides that Lewinsky would contradict the president,
and Clinton conducted business as usual, while the revolving door
of grand jury witnesses and a fight over attorney-client privilege
continued at the federal courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, making a long-planned trip to Capitol Hill, was greeted
with a four-minute standing ovation from Democratic House members.
Clinton promised to veto legislation, including spending bills,
that would impose restrictions on the use of statistical sampling
in the 2000 Census. He also promised to veto managed care
legislation that Democrats view as inadequate. And he urged
Democrats to resist Republican appeals for a tax cut before
Congress develops a long-range solution that guarantees a solvent
Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   The House minority leader, Richard A. Gephardt, said after the
closed meeting that Starr's investigation of Clinton was not
discussed. ``He has said he's going to testify. We have known that
and we support him in that, and what we say is that's all that
needs to be done,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Richard E. Neal, a Springfield Democrat, said
Clinton ``said I'm going to get the House back for you by
fund-raising, raising issues, and raising Cain on the campaign
trail.''
</P>
<P>
   But Representative Elijah E. Cummings, a Democrat from Maryland,
sounded a more cautious note. ``All of us are in a wait-and-see
pattern,'' he told reporters. ``We'll see what happens. I think
Aug. 17 will tell a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Vic Fazio of California, chairman of the
Democratic caucus, said, ``The silence is deafening on the
so-called Washington scandals.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Toiv avoided questions about Lewinsky. Asked
if Clinton was nervous about what Lewinsky might say, Toiv said,
``We have no view on it.'' When a reporter suggested that the
president must have a view if someone is accusing him of crimes,
Toiv snapped, ``Well, you must know more than I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr, who has had a recent string of court victories involving
privileges for government attorneys and Secret Service agents,
continued Wednesday to bring witnesses before the grand jury,
including former White House deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes.
</P>
<P>
   Ickes was expected to be asked about grand jury testimony last
month from a Secret Service uniformed officer who reportedly said
he and Ickes found Clinton and Lewinsky alone in a room off the
Oval Office. Ickes, after a previous grand jury appearance, denied
ever seeing anything improper between Clinton and Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Lanny Breuer, the special White House counsel and a key player
in the administration's damage-control operation, returned to the
courthouse Wednesday after testifying on Tuesday. Breuer met with
US District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson to discuss his refusal to
answer certain questions before the grand jury, as the White House
weighed its next step in the continuing battle with Starr over
attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has been rebuffed in its efforts to invoke
attorney-client privilege to prevent White House lawyers from being
subpoenaed to testify, most recently by Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist, who has upheld rulings compelling the government lawyers
to testify.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is asking the Supreme Court to take up the issue
when its session resumes in October. So far, the courts have found
that while attorney-client privilege exists between government
attorneys and their clients, that privilege does not extend to
criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, the FBI continued its DNA testing on a dark blue
dress belonging to Lewinsky. She reportedly gave the dress to her
mother for safekeeping because it may contain genetic material from
an encounter with Clinton. Lewinsky turned over the dress after
Starr granted immunity to her and her mother.
</P>
<P>
   With Lewinsky expected to testify Thursday, Starr obviously is
winding down his investigation. At the courthouse, where satellite
trucks have been stationed for more than six months, a sign posted
by a television crew to answer passersby and tourists reads:
``We're here for the Ken Starr grand jury. Monica is not here.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, someone had scrawled below those words: ``But check
back tomorrow.''

JERRY SEINFELD: NEW YORKERS REVELS IN STAR'S HOMECOMING

clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling

(JT) 
 By FRANK BRUNI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Barbara Toniolo, an editor for a Manhattan publishing
house, is not a classic celebrity hound. She says she likes to
believe she has more common sense than that. She likes to think she
has more restraint.
</P>
<P>
   And yet a force beyond even her powers of resistance pulled her
Wednesday evening toward the Broadhurst Theater on West 44th
Street, where she stood in a crunch of people waiting not for
admission to the show, but for a glimpse of its star. It was Jerry
Seinfeld or bust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's kind of nuts,'' Ms. Toniolo apologized. But, she
added, there is something particular about her relationship with
Seinfeld as an entertainer, something special about the way his
eponymous television series captured her experience of New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The characters are so New York-neurotic: completely
egocentric, completely self-absorbed, totally mean-spirited,'' Ms.
Toniolo rhapsodized. ``It really rings a bell.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Toniolo's reverie spoke to the fact that what was happening
in and outside the Broadhurst, where Seinfeld is scheduled to do a
string of comedy performances through Sunday, was more than the
opening night of a breathlessly anticipated engagement.
</P>
<P>
   It was a homecoming party of sorts for a native son who had
strayed far away _ becoming, in a sense, New York City's comedic
ambassador to the rest of the world _ and was returning not only to
his stand-up roots, but to the warped soil of his sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   Seinfeld, in other words, was back where he belonged.
</P>
<P>
   According to his publicist, Elizabeth Clark, Manhattan once
again became his primary residence on Sunday, when he returned from
several months of touring with his current stand-up show. Before
that, he lived for the better part of the decade in Los Angeles,
where ``Seinfeld'' was taped.
</P>
<P>
   The fans who lined up Wednesday to greet him seemed well aware
of his change of address, and said they found it both fitting and,
for reasons they could not quite explain, comforting. ``So often,
I'm watching him and I feel like he's talking about my own life,''
said Michael Colosi, a Manhattan lawyer who managed to score one of
fewer than 10,000 tickets available for just 10 shows. ``It's
wonderful to have him home.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene outside the Broadhurst underlined the way in which the
surreal world of ``Seinfeld'' and the real world of New York City
were inextricable, the degree to which the former stole unabashedly
from the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Kramer, the loose-limbed, shaggy-haired man on whom the
character of Kramer in ``Seinfeld'' was based, stood on the
sidewalk plugging Kramer's Reality Tour, a bus jaunt through
Manhattan that connects settings from the show with actual
Manhattan locations. The bus itself made little loops around the
block, reappearing outside the theater every five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I couldn't get tickets to the show, I'm
shamelessly cashing in on it,'' Kramer said, his candor matching
that of his fictional namesake. ``Who would have thought Jerry
quitting TV would be such a bonanza for me?''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, someone handed out copies of ``The Real Seinfeld: As
Told by the Real Costanza,'' a new book by a New Yorker named Mike
Costanza. He claims to be the inspiration for the character of
George Costanza in ``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   In public comments leading up to last night's performance,
Seinfeld portrayed coming back as a matter of reconnecting with his
inspiration. He was born in Brooklyn, reared on Long Island and cut
his teeth in comedy clubs in Manhattan, where he spent most of his
time until ``Seinfeld'' took off in the early 90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``All humor emanates from New York,'' he said at a press
conference in Manhattan on Tuesday, one of several events through
which he seemed to be celebrating and trumpeting his arrival.
</P>
<P>
   He visited Shea Stadium on Monday night to watch a Mets game and
is scheduled to appear on ``Late Night with David Letterman''
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   He has also reportedly dropped by the Beresford, a tony,
celebrity-studded building on Central Park West where a duplex
apartment he purchased is being remodeled for him. In the meantime,
his publicist said, he is living at another Manhattan apartment he
owns.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived at the Broadhurst at 6:25 p.m. Wednesday,
stepping from the back seat of a gleaming black Mercedes sedan, he
was stopped short by a roar of good will from people clustered
behind blue police barricades on both sides of the street. His
smile seemed wider and truer than any he had ever flashed on
television.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps he had been away too long. His 60-minute set
included only a small number of jokes drawn directly from New York
life, most of them having to do with the pungency and terror of
riding in taxis. To get a hack license, he said, ``All you need is
a face.''
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for the twice-nightly show, titled ``Jerry Seinfeld: I'm
Telling You for the Last Time: Live on Broadway,'' cost $75 and
sold out in one day two weeks ago. Seinfeld is donating the
proceeds to arts programs in New York City schools.
</P>
<P>
   But that has not stopped illegal profiteers from trying to take
their own cut. David Corvette, a spokesman for the New York State
attorney general, said law enforcement officials had received
anecdotal reports of widespread scalping, including prices of up to
$1,500 for tickets to the final show, to be broadcast live on Home
Box Office.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House on Wednesday soundly rejected a measure
that would have blocked President Clinton's directive banning job
discrimination against federal workers who are gay.
</P>
<P>
   In an emotional, heartfelt debate that prompted some
conservatives to side with liberals, the House voted 252-176 to
cast aside the amendment, rejecting arguments that Clinton's
measure would lead to affirmative action for homosexuals. The vote
also revealed a degree of discomfort among some Republicans toward
the party's recent radical salvos against homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a person does an honest day's work for an honest day's pay,
that's all I can ask,'' said Rep. Tom Bliley, R-Va., who added that
he ``unequivocally opposes'' discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment, sponsored by Rep. Joel Hefley, R-Colo., was
attached to a spending bill and would have undone a May 28
executive order by Clinton that adds homosexuals to the groups that
may not be discriminated against in federal employment. The order
sought to make uniform a federal employment policy that is already
in effect at many agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Hefley said he sought to rein in Clinton, who he believes has
abused his power in issuing a blizzard of executive orders during
his two terms. ``This amendment is not about homosexuality, and
it's not about discrimination,'' Hefley said. ``It's about the
misuse of the executive order process. The process is not designed
to circumvent the Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Hefley also argued that this particular executive order banning
discrimination would lead to affirmative action, quotas and special
privileges for homosexuals, a contention that a number of
conservative Republicans flat-out rejected. Only a handful of
Republicans Wednesday night chose to speak out in support of the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, several Republicans took to the floor to criticize the
amendment, including those who object to homosexuality on moral and
religious grounds. ``Homosexuals are taxpayers too and deserve an
equal break in terms of fairness in employment,'' said Rep. Dana
Rohrabacher, a conservative California Republican, amused that he
stood in the company of Democrats. ``There is no reason for the
federal government to discriminate for or against an individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chris Shays, R-Conn., said he was ``outraged'' that
Republican leaders ``sought to make this a political issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights advocates viewed Hefley's amendment as an
election-year ploy meant to appease social conservatives who have
accused Republican leaders of neglecting causes like abortion,
homosexuality and affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are throwing political bones to the extreme right wing of
the party in advance of the '98 elections,'' said David Smith, a
spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay
and lesbian political organization. ``They perceive it to be good
politics in a low-turnout election. And they need to energize their
base.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time in as many weeks that the House has
grappled with issues relating to homosexuality. Last week, the
House passed a measure that would prevent San Francisco from using
federal housing money to implement that city's policies supporting
live-in homosexual partners. The amendment passed by two votes.
</P>
<P>
   The two proposals are part of a larger effort on the part of
some Republicans to take a more vocal stance against homosexuality.
Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., the Republican leader, recently compared
homosexuality to kleptomania. House Republicans also joined in the
fray, quoting Scripture to make their point. And Republicans have
succeeded in blocking the nomination of a wealthy gay contributor,
James Hormel, as ambassador to Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives intensified the debate when they began running
full-page newspaper advertisements featuring ``reformed''
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's defeated proposal was part of a larger spending bill
that would earmark a total of $34 billion for the Departments of
Commerce and Justice, as well as the State Department.

HOUSE VOTES TO FINANCE CENSUS WORK FOR SIX MONTHS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House voted Wednesday to finance only six
months of next year's preparations for the 2000 census until the
White House and congressional Republicans can agree on how the head
count will be conducted.
</P>
<P>
   By a 227-201 vote, the House defeated a Democratic measure that
would have financed for the full 1999 fiscal year the Census
Bureau's activities in preparation for the 2000 census. The vote on
an amendment to the spending bill for the Commerce, Justice and
State Departments is the latest round in the continuing partisan
fight over how the next census will be carried out.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has already passed a spending bill for these
agencies' budgets for all of the next fiscal year. As a result, the
House and Senate versions of the spending bill will have to be
reconciled in a conference.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's action followed a debate replete with partisan
sniping, disputes over the legality of some methods of taking the
census, attacks on the Clinton administration's trustworthiness,
and criticism of scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came after a meeting between President Clinton and
congressional Democrats in which Clinton made clear that he would
veto any legislation that prohibited the Census Bureau from using
statistical methods to supplement the traditional head count in the
next census, participants said.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are the bureau's plans to count all the people in 90
percent of all households in each of the country's census tracts _
neighborhoods consisting of roughly 1,700 dwellings each _ and then
use statistical calculations to estimate the number and
characteristics of those living in the remaining 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of statistical sampling, including a panel appointed
by the National Academy of Science, say it would reduce the cost of
conducting the census and avoid a repeat of what happened in the
1990 census, which missed 8.4 million people and double-counted 4.2
million others. Though the plan was originally proposed by the Bush
administration, it has drawn the wrath of congressional Republicans
who compare it to polling and say it is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's vote is a step in what is turning into a game of
political chicken between the White House and congressional
Republicans. Though the White House would prefer that Congress
finance the Census Bureau's plans for the entire 1999 fiscal year,
it would accept a bill that financed the Commerce, Justice and
State departments for six months until the census flap is settled.
</P>
<P>
   The White House believes the threat of shutting down the federal
courts, the FBI, the Immigration and Naturalization Service,
federal prisons, foreign embassies and other government functions
next spring would pressure Republicans to mute their opposition to
using statistical methods to augment the census.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, who were stung in 1995 by two government
shutdowns, want to limit any potential shutdown of the Census
Bureau.

 &HT;    Galarraga, Tony Perez spiritual kin
 &HT;    By Terrence Moore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- While some people see little green men in their
cornflakes, I'm often victimized by the memory of the Big Red
Machine. This was not only my favorite team as a youth growing up
in the Midwest, but it was the biggest thing I cared about, next to
breathing.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, you must place an asterisk by the following,
especially with the Cincinnati Reds in town: Whenever I see Andres
Galarraga of the Atlanta Braves at the plate, in the field, around
the clubhouse or anywhere else below the sky, I see Tony Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I can see the similarities. Definitely,'' said Braves
pitcher John Smoltz, nodding Wednesday in the home clubhouse at
Turner Field. Then again, we're talking about John Smoltz, a nice
guy, who already knows he's one of my favorite players on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Let's try somebody else. Let's go for the jugular. How about
asking Ken Griffey Sr., the Reds' batting coach? Not only did
Griffey have the same position in Colorado, where Galarraga slugged
his way into prominence, but Griffey played on the Machine with
Perez during the 1970s, when they rolled to more victories than
anybody in baseball and two world championships.
</P>
<P>
   So what do you think, Griff? Although Perez is from Cuba and
Galarraga is from Venezuela, they both have the distinction of
operating as power-hitting first basemen in or around the cleanup
position. Plus, while Perez sparked others in the Reds lineup as
the clutch man among clutch men, Galarraga has assumed the same
role during his first year with the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``Their stances aren't even close to being the same,'' said
Griffey, grimacing, making us a little nervous. But then Griffey
got on a mighty roll for our sanity, adding, ``But they both have a
big amount of pride in doing their best. They both have this great
presence in the clubhouse, where they use their personalities to
keep everybody else loose. They both like to have fun, but at the
same time, they both take their work seriously. Plus, they're both
good people on and off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   That's all fine, but Griffey forgot about the biggest thing of
all when comparing Perez I and Perez II: The smile. Always the
smile, with Galarraga's matching that of Perez's in terms of having
the ability to light up the world with a quick flash of teeth and
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga was in the minor leagues with Montreal during the late
1970s when the Reds foolishly traded Perez to the Expos. Said
Galarraga, ``There were even people back then who said we resembled
each other. Yeah, we both smile a lot. And, as hitters, we both hit
to right field and to all fields, and we both are RBI men for our
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   They've also become more like twins in recent years. That's
because during Perez's post-playing days he has gone from being a
coach in Cincinnati to an executive with the Florida Marlins. It
all has given Perez and Galarraga time to huddle at the ballpark
for long stretches.
</P>
<P>
   Said Galarraga, bursting into another one of those gigantic
smiles, ``We've become good friends.''
</P>
<P>
   No, they've become good clones. Now, if only the Braves could
resemble the Big Red Machine by winning another world title in this
century.

SMOG FROM WEEKDAY TRAFFIC BRINGS WEEKEND RAIN, ASU RESEARCHERS
SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN VAN DER WERF  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Americans' work habits are ruining their
weekends.
</P>
<P>
   This is not about cellular phones and pagers and workaholics.
This is something more basic: the weather.
</P>
<P>
   New research by two climatologists at Arizona State University
shows that along the East Coast, rainy days are most prevalent on
the weekends. Monday and Tuesday are markedly drier.
</P>
<P>
   The reason?
</P>
<P>
   Pollution that builds up throughout the workweek _ carbon
monoxide and ozone primarily from auto exhaust _ climaxes Thursday
and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   That growing cloud of pollution proves inviting to rainstorms
for two reasons.
</P>
<P>
   First, each raindrop needs a speck of material _ a
``particulate'' in pollution parlance _ to form around. That is one
reason why a car is dirty after a rainstorm. Second, particulates
absorb heat. The air heats, hot air rises, condenses and drops
rain.
</P>
<P>
   Voila, as they might call it on Cape Cod: the weekend washout.
</P>
<P>
   As traffic congestion eases over the weekend, so does pollution,
and thus, after a gloomy weekend, the beginning of the workweek can
often be sunny and bright.
</P>
<P>
   Mondays had 22 percent less rain than Saturdays up and down the
East Coast from 1979-95, professors Randy Cerveny and Robert
Balling Jr. found. Saturdays had about 25.9 inches of rain, while
Mondays averaged 21.2 inches. The research is reported in today's
(Thurday, Aug. 6) issue of the science journal ``Nature''.
</P>
<P>
   The rain patterns are so consistent that the researchers have
ruled out coincidence. Since the seven-day week is an invention of
man, Cerveny and Balling concluded that the variations must be due
to man's influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human effect on weather is the only explanation,'' Balling
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cerveny said, ``We appear to be affecting global weather on a
scale that is comparable to El Nino.''
</P>
<P>
   A newspaper editor wrote 100 years ago, ``Everybody talks about
the weather but nobody does anything about it.'' Now, we know that
is not true.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding pavement and new buildings are believed to heat up the
local climate in large Southern and Western cities, especially
Phoenix, a phenomenon known as the ``heat island effect.'' The
buildup in so-called ``greenhouse gases'' is blamed for increasing
temperatures worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   This study may be the first, though, to find a positive effect
of pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Cerveny and Balling theorize that the prevalence of pollution
reduces the severity of hurricanes, and their research shows that
hurricanes tend to be weaker on weekends, when conceivably more
lives might be lost because more people are at home.
</P>
<P>
   Cerveny and Balling studied three sets of data: daily carbon
monoxide and ozone measurements for the Sable Island monitoring
station off the coast of Nova Scotia from 1991-97, daily rainfall
totals for the Atlantic coast up to about 400 miles off-shore, and
hurricane intensity records from 1946 to the present. In every
case, they found the same patterns of variations and significant
differences in rain depending on the day of the week.
</P>
<P>
   East Coast boaters and outdoor enthusiasts are wll aware of the
tendency for bad weekend weather. It is nicknamed the ``Sunday
effect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that a lot of the time around here in the summer,
when you look at the five-day forecast, it's nice during the week
and it's raining on weekends,'' said Gary Bahena, a Washington
lawyer and avid sailor. ``I'm always tempted _ and I have taken
clients sailing during the week _ because there's a better chance
the weather will be good.''
</P>
<P>
   There are exceptions to the rule.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Andrew, the costliest hurricane in American history,
actually intensified between Friday and Monday in August 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Cerveny said widespread pollution usually lessens the impact of
hurricanes by diffusing their power. Hurricanes gain energy at
their center by converting water vapor to water.
</P>
<P>
   Particulates can cause rain storms to break out at the fringes
of the hurricane, helping the storm blow itself out.
</P>
<P>
   Cerveny and Balling are trying out their theory elsewhere. They
are doing tests along the Pacific Coast of Mexico to see whether
the pollution from Mexico City is having an effect.
</P>
<P>
   Cerveny believes it is possible that pollution produced in
Southern California, in the Los Angeles-San Diego corridor, may
have some effect on weather in Arizona, but he hasn't studied it
yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible that pollution out there (in California) is
having an impact on our weather,'' Cerveny said. ``Pollution is
having a larger impact than we had ever thought before.'' &QL;

   &QL;  HOUSE REJECTS HEFLEY ANTI-GAY RIGHTS MEASURE
</P>
<P>
   By Elliot Zaret
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Aug. 5 -- The House convincingly reaffirmed an
executive order by President Clinton Wednesday that protects
homosexuals from discrimination in federal employment -- rejecting
a measure by Rep. Joel Hefley, R-Colorado Springs, that would have
overturned the order.
</P>
<P>
   The 252-176 vote, came as a much needed victory for gay rights
advocates, who were reeling from a House vote last week in favor of
a measure targeting a San Francisco domestic partners ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excluding someone from the workplace because of their sexual
orientation is discrimination plain and simple,'' said Rep. John
Lewis, D-Ga. ``It is unbelievable to me that 33 years after Selma
and the Voting Rights Act we must still fight against bigotry.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hefley and his supporters said the measure, which was to be
tacked onto the spending plan for the Departments of Commerce,
State and Justice, had nothing to do with discrimination or gay
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about the misuse of executive orders,'' said Hefley.
``The process is not meant to circumvent Congress... We need to
stop this President who wants to legislate and rule by executive
fiat.''
</P>
<P>
   Hefley's amendment targeted a second executive order as well
that But opponents said this provision, which Hefley added in
recent weeks, was merely a red herring to divert attention from the
anti-gay rights portion of the measure. Earlier in the day, Clinton
suspended the federalism executive order.
</P>
<P>
   To remove any doubt, Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., the only open gay
Republican in the House, introduced a measure of his own that
supplanted the federalism portion of Hefley's. The Kolbe amendment
passed overwhelmingly.
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe said that he wanted to make sure the vote on the Hefley
amendment was about one thing: whether the government ``should be
able to fire, to not hire, to fail to promote solely on the basis
of sexual orientation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A vote on Hefley will be simply saying... that discrimination
on sexual orientation is okay,'' said Kolbe. ``Do you want that?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's order amends an executive order by President Nixon
which bans federal job discrimination based on race, sex, religion
and age -- adding to it sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republican, including some who voted for last week's
anti-domestic partners measure, voted against Hefley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homosexuals are taxpayers too and deserve an even break,''
said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif, a conservative who voted in
favor of last week's anti-gay rights measure. ``The federal
government has no need to inquire into this aspect of people's
lives... Government should neither persecute homosexuals nor
promote homosexuals.''
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of Hefley's plan said that the executive order
could bog down courts, and force the government to provide
affirmative action for homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This executive order would be an administrative nightmare,''
said Rep. Bob Riley, R-Ala. ``It creates unnecessary, unwarranted
and unwanted preferences in the workplace.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., said the idea that the
executive order would result in affirmative action is absurd.
Nixon's original order included age and religion, which have never
been the subject of quotas or job preference, said Campbell, who is
a staunch opponent of affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orientation is not observable,'' said Campbell. ``It is quite
a stretch to think that this prohibition on discrimination will
lead to a quota system.''

TWO TEEN MOTHERS TO SUE OVER HONOR SOCIETY EXPULSION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: refiling to note that spelling of Chasity in 3rd graf is
cq)  (nk) 
 By ETHAN BRONNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COVINGTON, Ky. _ Two 17-year-old high school students who say
they were denied membership in the National Honor Society because
they were pregnant are planning to sue their school board in
federal court here on grounds of sexual discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union, which is to file suit for
the girls on Thursday, says it sees the case as a way to seek wider
enforcement of federal laws banning sex discrimination due to
pregnancy in high school.
</P>
<P>
   The two girls, Somer Chipman and Chasity Glass, both 17 and top
students at Grant County High School in nearby Williamstown, are
raising their daughters as they prepare for their senior year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chipman, whose daughter's name is Cheyenne, plans to marry
the father, a 21-year-old worker at an oil-change shop, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Glass lives with her mother with her 15-month-old daughter,
Shelby. The baby's father, who just graduated, helps with child
care and plans to join the National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Both girls, like many residents in their community, a rural,
tobacco-growing area where alcohol sales are banned, say they were
wrong to have engaged in premarital sex but consider abortion a far
greater sin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake,'' Ms. Glass said, bouncing Shelby on her
lap, in the office of a local lawyer. ``It's just that others
haven't gotten caught.''
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyer, Sara Mandelbaum of the ACLU, described the case this
way: ``It's making a girl wear a scarlet P and bear the burden for
something that is a joint activity. No boy is being left out of the
society for having engaged in premarital sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Admission to the National Honor Society, which recognizes
outstanding high school students, is based on national guidelines
but is under the direct authority of local chapters. Boards of
teachers choose members according to scholarship, character,
service and leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chipman, whose grade-point average is 3.9 on a scale of 4.0,
and Ms. Glass, with 3.7, were never officially told why, out of 33
students with the required academic record, they were the only ones
to have been denied entry to the National Honor Society. When they
demanded an explanation, they were simply told that they had not
met the criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Both girls have been exemplary students, earning top marks in
such courses as ``advanced placement'' English and chemistry, and
have won local and state awards. Ms. Chipman and Ms. Glass say
membership in the National Honor Society has been a lifelong goal.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Ruberg, lawyer for the Grant County Board of Education,
said that given the county's conservative nature, denying
membership to the two girls was neither surprising nor
controversial for most residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the fact that character is one of the criteria,'' Ruberg
said by telephone, ``the admissions committee did not feel that
someone who had engaged in premarital sex should be held up as a
role model for the rest of the students to emulate, whether male or
female.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruberg added that if paternity was known, through birth
certificates or lawsuits, boys would also be excluded from
membership in the National Honor Society.
</P>
<P>
   According to the organization's handbook, under ``provisions of
federal law, pregnancy _ whether within or without wedlock _ cannot
be the basis for automatic denial of the right to participate in
any public school activity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It may properly be considered, however, like any other
circumstance, as a factor to be assessed in determining character
as it applies to the National Honor Society,'' the handbook adds.
``But pregnancy may be taken into account in determining character
only if evidence of paternity is similarly regarded.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mandelbaum said it was precisely the fact that boys who
engaged in premarital sex faced no such exclusion that made the
girls' rejection an act of sex discrimination and a violation of
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and the Equal
Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that pregnancy has been an issue in
membership in the National Honor Society. Earlier this year, a girl
in Xenia, Ohio, complained that she had been expelled from her
local chapter after becoming pregnant, said Patricia Scanlon, of
the department of student activities at the National Association of
Secondary School Principals, which oversees the honor society.
</P>

   In 1990, a Pennsylvania girl who was expelled from an honor
society over a pregnancy lost her challenge in federal court, but
in Illinois in 1985, a similar federal lawsuit was successful. Ms.
Scanlon said chapters around the country had allowed pregnant girls
to become members.

   Lance Yeager, an editor at The Grant County News, which has a
weekly circulation of 5,000, said letters to the newspaper were

   Ms. Chipman said she had received numerous letters of
encouragement. Ms. Glass said she also sensed much community
support, adding: ``Times are changing. Not all teen mothers are
stereotypes. I want to be a teacher. I didn't drop out of school.
But I'm not recommending this.''

<P>
   Ms. Glass said she hoped to take part in a local committee that
urges the postponing of sexual activity among high school students
and use her own case as an example.

   ``I wouldn't give up my daughter for the world,'' she said,

FCC EASING RULES TO BUILD DATA SYSTEMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission intends to propose rules
Friday that may accelerate the deployment of high-speed cyberspace
links to homes across the United States, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the commission will propose that the nation's big
local telephone companies be allowed to avoid reselling the use of
their advanced data systems if they establish separate data
subsidiaries, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   If the proposal survives the lobbying that it will surely
elicit, it will give the local Bell phone companies one of their
biggest regulatory victories since passage of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, local phone companies must resell the use of their
systems to new competitors. The incumbents have said the resale
rules discourage them from investing to upgrade their lines to
carry high-speed data because the resale obligation could prevent
them from recouping costs.
</P>
<P>
   By giving the local phone giants, including the five remaining
Baby Bells and GTE, a way around the resale rules, the commission
is trying to encourage them to speed the introduction of high-speed
on-ramps to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   While broadband access to the Internet is becoming more common,
it is still not nearly as available to everyday consumers as
lawmakers anticipated when they passed the telecommunications act
two years ago. That situation has created intense pressure from
Capitol Hill for the FCC to come up with results.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major impediment that the Internet faces in becoming more
useful to the American consumer is bandwidth capacity,'' said
William Kennard, the commission's chairman, who supports the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The outline of the plan became clear a few weeks ago as the
commission's staff issued the first draft of the proposal. Since
then, FCC officials have been hammering out details.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal will provoke a high-stakes lobbying battle. The
long-distance industry and new local carriers are expected to say
that allowing the Baby Bells to avoid reselling their data systems
will harm competition. The Bells are expected to say they should
not have to create new subsidiaries to avoid resale rules.

 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Boston Globe on Wednesday night asked for the resignation of
Mike Barnicle, its most prominent and pugnacious columnist, after a
turbulent day that began with charges that the columnist had used
George Carlin's material without attribution to the comedian in a
recent column.
</P>
<P>
   The similarities between 10 items in Barnicle's column on Sunday
and jokes and musings in Carlin's best-selling book
``Braindroppings'' led the Globe's editor, Matthew Storin, to issue
a statement Wednesday afternoon saying that the columnist would be
suspended without pay for a month. The statement included
Barnicle's assertion that he had not read the book but had used
jokes given him by a friend without checking their origins.
</P>
<P>
   As the statement was being issued, local television station
WCVB-TV confirmed that in an appearance on June 22, Barnicle had
recommended 17 books as summer reading _ among them
``Braindroppings,'' which, he said, had ``a yuck on every page.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the possiblity that the columnist, who has been a
lightning rod for criticism in the past, had either deceived his
editors or the television audience, the editors conferred with
Storin, who is on vacation overseas, and decided to seek Barnicle's
resignation. It is a resignation that, Barnicle said last night, he
has no intention of offering.
</P>
<P>
   The uproar came less than two months after another prominent and
popular Globe columnist, Patricia Smith, was forced to resign after
admitting that she had fabricated characters in four recent
columns. A check of Ms. Smith's columns dating to 1995 showed that
48 included names of people whose existence could not be verified.
</P>
<P>
   In a career spent writing sharp-edged commentary on both
prominent and little-known Bostonians, Barnicle has made his share
of enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard law professor, complained that in a
1990 column Barnicle had falsely written that Dershowitz had made
an ethnic slur.
</P>
<P>
   In ensuing discussions between Dershowitz and The Globe, a legal
settlement was reached and all parties agreed to keep the terms
confidential, according to a lawyer who has been briefed on the
details of the settlement. Neither Barnicle nor The Globe retracted
the statement, but the agreement called for The Globe to pay
$75,000 to Dershowitz, the lawyer said. Neither The Globe, which is
owned by The New York Times Co., nor Dershowitz would comment on
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   But few in Boston, a town of intense loyalties and equally
intense feuds, would have predicted that Barnicle would bend
journalistic rules _ even inedvertently _ so soon after he had been
held up to scrutiny after Ms. Smith's forced resignation.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, a reporter for the Internet site of The Globe's
rival newspaper, The Boston Herald, tipped off by an e-mail message
from a reader, compared Barnicle's Aug. 2 column, which ran under
the headline ``I was just thinking ...'' to Carlin's book and found
10 parallel passages.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle, for example, wrote in his column, ``Someday I'd love
to see the Pope appear on his balcony and announce the baseball
scores.'' Carlin writes in his book, ``Someday I wanna see the Pope
come out on that balcony and give the football scores.''
</P>
<P>
   In his statement issued Wednesday night, Storin said: ``This
evening I have asked for Mike Barnicle's resignation. He served
this paper as its leading Metro columnist for over 25 years, and
served it well, but in the past few days and particularly the past
few hours, his relationship with his readers and his employers has
become untenable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike had earlier today told his editors that he never read a
book by George Carlin, portions of which clearly influenced his
column of last Sunday, though there was no attribution to the
comedian. In light of Channel 5's video clip showing Mike
recommending Carlin's book to viewers on June 22, it is clear that
he misrepresented himself either to his television audience or his
editors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This contradiction is unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached at his home in Lincoln, Mass., Barnicle, 55, said, ``No,
I'm not going to submit my resignation.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had told his editors the truth and had recommended
the book based only on his familarity with Carlin's work over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle then referred to other recent embarrassments to news
organizations, including CNN's highly publicized retraction of a
story about the use of nerve gas by United States forces in Laos 28
years ago, which led to the dismissal of two producers by CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we in this business have gotten to the point where using
someone else's jokes, telling someone else's jokes without
attribution, can be equated to saying mistakenly that Americans
killed other Americans with nerve gas, with making up whole columns
and magazine pieces,'' Barnicle said, ``if we've reached the point
in this business where the two are equal, then God help us all.''

   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Revolution found a winning combination
last night and snapped a Major League Soccer-record eight-game home
losing streak with a 3-0 victory over the San Jose Clash before
14,163 fans at Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution, with 19 points in 23 games, escaped last place
in the Eastern Conference and moved within a point of Miami for the
final playoff spot. Miami, with 20 points in 21 games, meets
last-place Tampa Bay tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian Oscar Pareja took over the midfield director's role
and made enough effective touches and threatening passes to get the
Revolution off to a successful start. Ivan McKinley scored in the
13th minute and Joe-Max Moore converted a poor clearance against
the run of play in the 42d minute. Then the Revolution held on
behind the goalkeeping of Ian Feuer, who started for the first time
since July 15, and clinched the match when Raul Diaz Arce chipped
goalkeeper David Kramer in the 89th minute.
</P>
<P>
   This was the Revolution's first home victory since a 4-3
decision over Tampa Bay May 10. It was their second win over San
Jose, the Western Conference's last-place team.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the Revolution were on the verge of radically
changing their attack as they attempted to acquire Carlos
Valderrama from Miami. But they failed to complete the deal, simply
rearranged their regular performers, and capitalized on the
aggressiveness of players such as Paul Keegan and the steadiness of
Pareja and Edwin Gorter.
</P>
<P>
   Pareja seemed assertive in his new role as midfield
choreographer. But the Revolution appeared unaccustomed to relying
on Pareja and seldom played to his pace.
</P>
<P>
   But whenever Pareja became involved in the offense, the
Revolution threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Moore headed off Kramer's left hand and the bar after a Pareja
cross in the fifth minute. The ball continued toward the far post,
and Eddie Lewis cleared it off the line as Keegan approached.
</P>
<P>
   Eight minutes later, Moore dribbled through two defenders and
Kramer blocked his shot near the goal area. Keegan then headed
Moore's corner in the penalty area, and McKinley finished into an
open net for the first goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution attempted to press their advantage and were on
the verge of losing control.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose began patiently pressuring the Revolution defense.
Feuer, who started slowly and nearly had a goal kick deflected into
his net, saved a Shawn Medved shot. Braeden Cloutier beat Feuer
with a 35-yard blast, but the shot hit the crossbar in the 26th
minute.
</P>
<P>
   The Clash then began firing away from long distance, and Feuer
stopped the best attempt, by Eric Wynalda.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the first half, Wynalda moved to the right side
and was put through by Victor Mella in the 41st minute. McKinley
kept Wynalda onside, but Wynalda shot wide toward the far post.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution had lost momentum, but they immediately countered
for a 2-0 lead in the 42d minute. Mike Burns sent a low drive in
from just outside the penalty area, and Oscar Draguicevich cleared
directly to Moore, who converted into the near side of the net.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution appeared to be energized, and Richard Goulooze
then headed off the post on a corner.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Revolution had increased their intensity, they needed
to vary the pace of the match.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose nearly scored in the second minute of the second half,
but Feuer tipped Wynalda's goal area shot for a corner. Wynalda
drew a foul, then curled a free kick to Richard Gough, whose header
was saved on the line by Feuer in the 10th minute.

Repairing and replacing slate-roofing tiles is not difficult, but
it can be dangerous because slate tiles are slippery and slate
roofs are often steep. Also walking on a slate roof can crack or
damage the existing, good tiles. For these reasons, it is best to
leave major repairs to a professional and confine your repair work
to those jobs that can be done near the edge of the roof from an
extension ladder. (Edward R. Lipinski/New York Times Illustration)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shy and retiring, Ralph Acampora is not.
</P>
<P>
   A managing director and head of technical research at Prudential
Securities, Acampora is a regular guest on financial news
television programs and a frequent bearer of soaring market
forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   But even Acampora, who is known for his rapid-fire faxes
whenever the markets twitch, seemed surprised by the market's
plunge on Tuesday after he made a sudden bearish turn.
</P>
<P>
   He was branded a raging bull by forecasting in 1995 that the Dow
Jones industrial average would rise above 7,000 in 1998. At the
time, the blue-chip index was at 4,500, causing many to dismiss his
projection as outlandish. The Dow surpassed 7,000 in April 1997, a
year ahead of his schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he upped the ante, alternately calling for the Dow to
close at 10,000 in mid-1998 or early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   So when one of Wall Steet's leading bulls morphed into a bear,
people noticed.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Acampora helped unleash a stock market plunge, a
299-point decline in the Dow, by forecasting that the blue-chip
index could fall 15 percent to 20 percent from its recent high.
Such a drop would push the Dow down to about 7,470, representing an
1,868-point nose dive from its peak.
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday, the slightly balding, Bronx-born Acampora was
even busier than usual, explaining what caused his about-face. Not
surprisingly, he pointed to Asia as the culprit, adding that
President Clinton's political problems just added to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are looking at a bear,'' Acampora said Wednesday. ``I've
got to tell you, too many people listened.''
</P>
<P>
   A day after delivering his cautionary words on CNBC, Acampora
spent the morning at a Wall Street investment conference. He said
he expected to find stock prices higher when he returned to his
office, with the market shrugging off his comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it would have some impact,'' he said, but ``I
thought we would be up a couple hundred points.''
</P>
<P>
   Some other Wall Street strategists moved quickly to counter the
damage Acampora had done and to reiterate their bullish sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   In a note to clients Wednesday morning, Abby Joseph Cohen,
co-chairwoman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs,
said the recent declines were an overreaction and that stock prices
were undervalued.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Galvin, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette, even suggested that investors increase their stock
holdings to 75 percent of their portfolios, from 65 percent. Galvin
also forecast that the Dow could top 10,000 within six months,
while Ms. Cohen predicted 9,300 at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Galvin recommended buying shares of financial, health care,
technology and retail stocks, sectors that improved during the day.
</P>
<P>
   While the Dow closed up 59.47 points, it was a
less-than-convincing rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market didn't respond to Abby like it's done in the
past,'' a Wall Street investment strategist said on the condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Acampora was also unimpressed with the modest gains. ``I think
we might have a couple of months of this'' before stock prices
begin rising again, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a technical analyst, Acampora relies primarily on stock
charts, studying price levels, trading volume and price movements,
to forecast market movements. Recently, he said, deteriorations in
the price of Dow stocks as well as the stocks in the Dow
transportation and utilities indexes caused him to expect steeper
declines.
</P>
<P>
   Although primarily a bull, Acampora has wavered a bit in his
market calls. In June 1997, he forecast that the Dow would hit
10,000 by June 1998. He later pushed that back to early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   There also have been a few misses. Last summer, he called for
the Dow to reach 8,750 by the end of the year. The Dow closed at
7,908.
</P>
<P>
   And in an interview last August, Acampora warned that he might
turn bearish sometime in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Acampora, 56, knows that everyone will be watching his
performance this time. ``To make this statement, I really had to
believe it. This is a career call. If it goes straight to 10,000,
people are not going to be too happy with me.''
</P>
<P>
   If this doesn't work, Acampora, a former seminarian, said,
``I'll be a teacher or something.''

more refined, more restrained,'' says William Lie Zeckendorf, of

JACEK KALABINSKI, 59, JOURNALIST WHO FLED POLAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Poland)  (lb) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jacek Kalabinski, a Polish journalist and former opposition
figure who worked in the United States since fleeing his native
land in 1983, died on July 24 at his home in Rockville, Md. He was
59.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Kalabinski was the Washington-based correspondent of the Warsaw
daily Rzezcpospolita (The Republic). He previously worked for Radio
Free Europe/Radio Liberty as a program editor in New York and a
senior correspondent in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A 1961 journalism graduate of the University of Warsaw, in
Poland, he did postgraduate work at the Ecole Nationale des
Sciences Politiques in Paris and as a journalism fellow at Stanford
University. He started his career in the 1960s working as a
reporter and editor in Warsaw.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968 he became a news editor for Polish Radio and from 1973
to 1981 he was a foreign affairs commentator for the Polish
National Radio network. After the imposition of martial law in
Poland he was dismissed as ``unfit to serve in a militarized unit
of Polish Radio and Television.''
</P>
<P>
   He had become the president of the Warsaw chapter of the Polish
Journalists' Association in 1981. The association was shut down by
the government the following year. He then was foreign editor of a
Warsaw Catholic monthly and of Poland's largest uncensored
underground weekly, Tygodnik Mazowsze. By then in hiding and on an
arrest list, he wrote under the pen name Cassandra.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his arrival in the United States, he was named a visiting
fellow at Yale University. His Op-Ed articles on Central Europe and
the Soviet Union soon appeared in The New York Times and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   A linguist, he also accompanied Lech Walesa to Capitol Hill when
Walesa, the chairman of Solidarity, Nobel laureate and Poland's
future president, addressed Congress in November 1989. To the
audience, Kalabinski's voice, a radio-trained baritone, became
Walesa's, rendering the speech into idiomatic English as the
visitor asked for support in efforts to make Poland ``the America
of the East.''
</P>
<P>
   Kalabinski's survivors include his wife, Barbara; a daughter,
Marta, 14; and his mother, Maria Kalabinska of Warsaw.

FORWARD TEES MEAN MORE IRON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; If recreational golfers as a group were not color blind, maybe
the game just might be more fun than frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   It's a conclusion reached after much observation at public,
resort and private courses throughout the West. More often than not
we bite off more course than suits our game because all we can see
are the blue tees.
</P>
<P>
   Consider how many times this scenario takes place as the
foursome or fivesome assembles on the first tee.
</P>
<P>
   ``What tees we playing today?'' someone asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's play the blues. Might as well see the whole course,''
responds the Big Hitter.
</P>
<P>
   What the heck. We've all got a bag full of titanium; why not be
like Tiger?
</P>
<P>
   Then Big Hitter promptly drives his ball a mile, but it ends up
farther right than Rush Limbaugh. The rest of us spray shots short
left, right and sometimes straight. We breathe a sigh of relief if
our drive clears the shaggy area separating the teeing ground from
the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   Then we arrive at our ball, check the distance left to the green
and reach for a fairway wood.From that point on the round consists
of driver, tree wood, chip and three putt.
</P>
<P>
   So here's a suggestion. Unless you have a single-digit handicap
and can reach medium-length par 5s in two shots on a regular basis,
avoid the blue tees. Play the whites.
</P>
<P>
   You probably spent a lot of money on those high-tech oversized
irons in your golf bag, so playing the forward tees will give you
an opportunity to actually use them on a course.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. How many times have you hit an eight- or
nine-iron on a medium length par 4 hole?
</P>
<P>
   There is no shame in recognizing the limits of your length and
shortening the course might actually improve your game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most golfers have a length at which they are most
comfortable,'' said Robert D. Thomas, editor and publisher of Fore
magazine, published by the Southern California Golf Association.
``If I can find a set of tees that are 6,100 yards, that's exactly
where I want to be. If I get longer than 6,200 yards, then I get
uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   So basically, pick the set of tees that suit your game, not
someone else's.
</P>
<P>
   A popular annual event, the SCGA net handicap tournament,
provides a good point of reference. Players are grouped according
to their USGA indexes, so participants compete against golfers of
similar skill. Everyone, though, plays from the white tees.
</P>
<P>
   And the scorecard on each course you play has a guide that tells
you whether you should play whites or blues or tees that are even
farther back. It's called the slope rating, a number that
corresponds to the degree of difficulty you are about to encounter.
The higher the number, the more difficult the course. A rating of
113 is average.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a course has a slope rating of 125 or more from the set of
tees you would (normally) play, think about moving up a set of
tees. If it's more than 130, definitely move up. You will still get
all the course with all the difficulty,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   This might even help improve the pace of play because it takes
less time to hit two shots into a green than three. And you might
spend less time looking for lost balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that when you play a set of tees that's
too far back, all you're doing is asking for trouble,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; The quest continues: &UR;  &LR; Nobby Orens, the Encino, Calif.,
travel-agency owner who is trying to become America's top
certifiable golf nut by going to really great lengths for a game,
took his quest to Alaska. The plan: to play golf for 24 hours
straight.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out that not even Alaska had enough daylight for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was both a good trip and a disappointment,'' he reported.
``The good part is that I got in 200 holes in 17 hours and 20
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobby started playing at 6:25 a.m. and shot 1,030 from the white
tees at the Palmer Golf Course in Palmer, Alaska, which is about 40
miles north of Anchorage. He played until about 11:45 p.m.,
averaging about five minutes per hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad news is that even though I had talked to the organizer
four or five times and I thought it was expressly understood that
my only reason for making the trip was to play for 24 hours, he
never told me that it gets dark at 11:45 and doesn't get light
again until 5 a.m.,'' Nobby said.
</P>
<P>
   Next month it will be golf on the front and back of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Nobby, a member at Braemar Country Club, plans to play a round
in Tarzana and in Auckland, New Zealand, on the same day. He will
travel about 6,500 miles between the 18th green and first tee.

ARCTIC SWEEP GETS COMPANY FOR SUNDAY'S BUICK HASKELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   OCEANPORT, N.J. _ For the past few days, Butch Reid, the trainer
for Arctic Sweep, has been waking up at night wondering who the
competition will be at this year's $1 million Buick Haskell
Invitational at Monmouth Park on Sunday. Reid tried to relax
Tuesday by playing a round of golf, but the thought kept slipping
into his mind.
</P>
<P>
   After another lonely day at the track Wednesday morning, Reid
stopped wondering. ``Four days away from the race, I'm still the
only horse at the course,'' he said. ``Hey, we're ready to go. Let
the chips fall where they may.''
</P>
<P>
   They did, as Arctic Sweep finally got some company. Coronado's
Quest, who has won three straight races and won the Dwyer at
Belmont on July 12, shipped in from Saratoga, joining Arctic Sweep
and ending some of the mystery for Reid. D. Wayne Lukas confirmed
that Grand Slam will arrive on Friday to run the race. Jerry Bailey
will ride Grand Slam, a horse who won two Grade I stakes races as a
2-year-old and was a Triple Crown hopeful who didn't pan out.
Victory Gallop, the winner of the Belmont Stakes and the runner-up
in the Preakness and Kentucky Derby, should also make the race.
Ian's Thunder, which finished second to Coronado's Quest at the
Dwyer, should fill out the field at five horses.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Mike Puype did not like the way Old Trieste looked after
a workout Wednesday morning and decided against entering him in the
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very prestigious race and a pivotal race for
3-year-olds,'' Lukas said by telephone from his barn at Santa Anita
in California. ``You don't have to make any excuses for running the
Haskell.''
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet, the winner of the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness,
pulled out of the race last week with a stifle problem (equivalent
to a knee injury in humans). That took some of the luster off the
race, but it still promises to be compelling because of the
presence of Coronado's Quest. He didn't participate in any of the
Triple Crown races, but is still considered to be one of the top
3-year-olds and may end up vying with Victory Gallop and Real Quiet
for end-of-the-year honors. This will be his first head-to-head
meeting against Victory Gallop.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas was not dismayed by the field's small size. ``Sometimes
you can get an eight-horse field and only three can run,'' he said.
``Sometimes you can have a four-horse field and three can run.
There's quality at the top end. Granted, you'd like to see the gate
full. But this is a tough time of year to do that with the
3-year-olds. I'm not familiar with the local horse, but the other
three horses are great Grade I horses. You have three Grade I
winners. That makes for a real interesting race.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott Walden, Victory Gallop's trainer, said he would have
held the horse out of the Preakness if Coronado's Quest had
entered. But the trainer Shug McGaughey decided not to run
Coronado's Quest in that race because of a hoof injury. Coronado's
Quest has also been ill-tempered in the past, throwing riders and
being unruly in the paddocks.
</P>
<P>
   McGaughey said Coronado's Quest had calmed down considerably and
the trainer did not expect his horse to be disorderly on race day.
As for the race, Coronado's Quest is the favorite because the fast
condition of the track at Monmouth Park favors his speed.
</P>
<P>
   Because Coronado's Quest did not run in the Triple Crown races,
McGaughey feels that the horse has a lot of catching up to do. He
is looking at the Haskell as a major step in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a fairly fresh horse and we've got something to
prove,'' McGaughey said. ``We feel like we've been in the minor
leagues and we're trying to get to the major leagues.'' &QL;

GLOBE SEEKS RESIGNATION OF COLUMNIST MIKE BARNICLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston Globe editor Matthew V. Storin Wednesday asked for the
resignation of 25-year columnist Mike Barnicle, asserting that his
``relationship with his readers and his employers has become
untenable'' in the wake of a column on Sunday containing
similarities to a book by comedian George Carlin.
</P>
<P>
   The stunning development comes less than two months after
another Globe Metro columnist, Patricia Smith, resigned after
admitting to fabricating aspects of some 1998 columns.
</P>
<P>
   The Barnicle column in question was presented as a collection of
random thoughts headlined ``I was just thinking.'' Globe editors
say the 38 one-liners in the column included eight items similar to
items in Carlin's best-selling 1997 book, ``BrainDroppings,''
without citing Carlin as the source. The Boston Herald published a
story Wednesday alleging that at least 10 items in the Barnicle
column resembled those in the book.
</P>
<P>
   The 54-year-old Barnicle, who has carved out a large following
and national reputation as a chronicler of urban working-class
struggles, issued a brief statement Wednesday night. ``I have no
intention of submitting my resignation,'' he said. ``I have done
nothing wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle told Globe editors Wednesday that he had received the
material for the column from two friends and that he was unaware it
was from Carlin's book, which he had not read. But WCVB-Ch.5
Wednesday showed a clip of Barnicle recommending ``BrainDroppings''
on the station's ``Chronicle'' program. Barnicle is a regular
contributor on the show.
</P>
<P>
   Before learning of the Chronicle book review, the Globe had
decided to suspend Barnicle for one month without pay. But in his
statement, Storin, who is out of the country, said that ``in light
of Channel 5's video clip showing Mike recommending Carlin's book
to viewers on June 22, it is clear that he misrepresented himself
either to his television audience or to his editors. The
contradiction is unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday before learning of the request for his
resignation, Barnicle acknowledged that he had recommended
``BrainDroppings'' on Channel 5. But he said that he spent ``maybe
four seconds'' discussing the subject, adding that ``I did not read
the book'' before recommending it.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe learned about problems with the column from Mark
Robinson, the owner of a Biddeford, Maine, marketing company, who
noticed the similarities with the Carlin book. After contacting the
Herald, Robinson called Globe Political Editor Doug Bailey at home
on Monday night and Bailey alerted other Globe editors Tuesday
morning, who then began their review.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those similiarities verified by the Globe include
Barnicle's writing that ``Someday I'd love to see the Pope appear
on his balcony and announce the baseball scores,'' while Carlin
said, ``Someday I wanna see the Pope come out on that balcony and
give the football scores.'' Barnicle asked ``How come planes aren't
made with the same indestructible material used to assemble those
black boxes that always survive crashes?'' while Carlin wrote, ``If
cockpit recorders are so indestructible, why don't they just build
an airplane that's one big cockpit voice recorder?''
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle said, ``I hate it when the person ahead of me in the
`12 Items or Less' line decides to pay for a pack of TicTacs by
writing a check.'' And on page 1 of his 258-page collection of
opinions and jokes Carlin said, ``Here's something I can do
without: people ahead of me on the supermarket line who are paying
for an inexpensive item by credit card or personal check. People!
Take my word for this: TicTacs is not a major purchase.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done the one-liners for 20 years,'' Barnicle said
Wednesday, explaining that he receives material for them from
friends and acquaintances inside and outside the Globe. ``I
literally have them on scraps of paper. ... Plagiarism is not the
right word to use here. Laziness or stupidity might be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going out and contriving an event,'' he added,
contrasting his actions with Smith's. ``This is a series of
observations ... nearly anyone can make.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle blamed some of the controversy surrounding his column
on the ``self-absorption of the media,'' and said he had spoken
earlier in the day with Carlin, who was sending him an autographed
copy of his book &UR;  &LR; with the inscriptionm, ``To my old pal Mike. Now
you can eliminate the middle man.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, a Carlin spokeswoman released a statement saying that
``Mike Barnicle is a great writer who got burned by one of his
sources. There are no hard feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle's work at the Globe had come under scrutiny since the
Smith case exploded in late June with revelations that she had
fabricated characters and quotes. In explaining why he had given
Smith a second chance despite evidence that she had fabricated some
1995 columns, Storin said at the time that he was concerned that
the paper had not ``addressed ... head on'' lingering doubts about
Barnicle's work.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after Smith resigned, Harvard law professor Alan
Dershowitz accused the Globe of following a double standard for not
similarly disciplining Barnicle for a 1990 column that Dershowitz
said contained a fabricated quote attributed to him.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Globe nor Barnicle acknowledges that the Dershowitz
quote was concocted. And after Smith's departure, Barnicle said
that for ``the last 25 years, I have never violated the trust my
publisher has placed in me, nor have I violated the trust, faith,
and confidence I hope my readers have placed in me.''
</P>
<P>
   Several days after Smith's resignation, the Globe reported that
it had reviewed 364 Barnicle columns dating to January 1996 and
concluded that those columns met ``professional standards.''
</P>
<P>
   In its August issue, however, Boston magazine resurrected its
``Barnicle Watch'' feature, raising questions about two 1991
columns that the magazine said featured characters who could not be
tracked down. It also mentioned two 1991 and 1992 columns that
reportedly elicited complaints from Chicago columnist Mike Royko,
who has since died, that Barnicle was borrowing from his material.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Barnicle dismissed Boston magazine as a group of
``people who sit in cubicles and put out a hotel guide.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked to respond to continuing questions about the veracity
of his columns, Barnicle said, ``I've made mistakes before.'' But
``I don't make (things) up.''

WASHINGTON GOVERNOR A WITNESS IN CONGRESSIONAL FUND-RAISING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RACHEL ZIMMERMAN, HEATH FOSTER and MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington Gov. Gary Locke was secretly deposed last month by
congressional investigators looking into questionable campaign
contributions from a Hong Kong businessman, his family and his
business associates.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Locke defended his campaign, saying he has nothing to
hide.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people weren't part of any of my planned events,'' Locke
said. ``I wouldn't know them if I saw them on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic governor was drawn into the congressional inquiry
after his campaign received $5,400 from family members and
associates of Ted Sioeng, an Indonesian-born businessman,
newspaper-owner and hotelier who reportedly controls an empire
worth $500,000 million.
</P>
<P>
   A key target of the probe, which is trying to uncover evidence
of illegal campaign contributions from foreign nationals, Sioeng
did not donate money to Locke's 1996 gubernatorial campaign. But
Sioeng's wife, his daughter, his son-in-law and two business
associates _ all under investigation as well _ donated $5,400 to
Locke in July of 1996, records show.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first time that Locke, the nation's first
Chinese-American governor, has been asked to respond to
investigators about questionable campaign donations collected from
the Asian community.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the governor said any missteps were completely
unintentional.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did nothing wrong,'' Locke said Wednesday, speaking to
reporters after news of his sworn testimony first appeared in the
Far Eastern Economic Review, a journal of business and politics.
The governor also suggested that the inquiry based on donors'
ethnicity may be racist.
</P>
<P>
   House Reform and Oversight Committee Chairman Dan Burton, an
Indiana Republican who has been pursuing alleged fundraising
misconduct, initially considered serving Locke with a subpeona, but
the governor offered to testify under oath willingly, said Locke
spokesman Keith Love.
</P>
<P>
   During Locke's July 8 deposition, the governor said he learned
that an $1,100 contribution from Sylvana Djojomartono, a Sioeng
associate listed in campaign reports as the manager of the
Hollywood Metropolitan Hotel, was likely laundered. Locke's lawyer,
Everett Billingslea, said he saw bank records showing Sioeng's
daughter, Jessica Elnitiarta, immediately reimbursed Djojomartono
for the contribution, which is illegal. Locke said he returned that
contribution to Djojomartono July 23.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's attorneys also questioned Locke about $1,100
contributions from others close to Sioeng including, Sundari
Elnitiarta, who is Sioeng's wife and has apparently left the
country, according to a committee investigator; Kent La, the U.S.
distributor of Red Pagoda Mountain cigarettes; and Glenville
Stuart, listed in campaign reports as self employed and working at
the Sunset Market &AMP; Liquor store on Sunset Boulevard in Los
Angeles. Congressional investigators also asked about a $1,000
contribution from Ridwan Dinata, Sioeng's son-in-law who is married
to Jessica Elnitiarta and is listed in campaign reports as
president of Panda Estate Investments in Hollywood. It's a business
he co-owns with Sioeng, according to the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Elnitiarta, Stuart, or Djojomartona returned calls
seeking comment. There is no telephone listing for either La or
Dinata. Locke received all five checks on the same day, July 31,
and all five contributors are under investigation by the committee.
The checks were delivered to the Locke campaign by David Lang,
Locke's fundraising representative in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Sioeng, who investigators say has fled the country, has denied
all wrongdoing through his attorneys. But committee members suspect
Sioeng of working on behalf of Chinese government interests.
Investigators say that more than half of the $400,000 that Sioeng's
family contributed to the Democratic National Committee in 1996 was
transferred from Hong-Kong based firms.
</P>
<P>
   Locke said he has provided investigators with cancelled checks
from all four donors, but has no personal connection to them.
</P>
<P>
   Locke said he would not return the four donations unless
investigators come up with evidence that they too were illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Burton's committee also asked Locke for written explanations
concerning legal donations he got from John Huang and Pauline
Kanchanalak. Huang was a fund-raiser for the Democratic National
Committee in 1996 and a former executive of the Lippo Group, a
conglomerate controlled by the Riady banking family of Indonesia.
Democrats returned $1.6 million of the more than $3 million he
raised. Huang and his wife Jane gave Locke $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Kanchanalak is a business consultant from Thailand who was
solicited by John Huang for donations. The DNC returned all
$253,000 she contributed after she said the money was not hers. She
gave Locke $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Burton has criticized U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno's failure
to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate campaign financing.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Warheit, executive director of the state Public
Disclosure Commission, said she has been cooperating with Burton.
Now, Warheit said, she will contact the committee ``and see if
there's anything there for us'' to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Mark J. MacDougall, a Washington, D.C-based lawyer for the
Elnitiarta family, said the congressional probe, which has so far
not uncovered any vast Chinese-backed influence-peddling scheme, is
fueled by bias.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last century Congress passed laws excluding Chinese
immigrants from the United States,'' MacDougall said. ``Some in
Congress apparently still believe that Asian-Americans should not
be allowed to freely particiapte in the political process.''
</P>
<P>
   Locke acknowledged that his campaign finance staff made some
mistakes during the 1996 campaign, primarily at a series of
fundraisers targeting the Asian community in New York and
California. But, he said, said there was little he could have done
to prevent the most recent flare-up.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he doesn't know how he could have avoided
receiving the checks without subjecting his donors to questions
that were insulting at best and at worst, racist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not about to go around asking every single person... `Are
</P>
<P>
   you a U.S. citizen and was this check reimbursed?' '' Locke
said.
</P>
<P>
   Locke said he first met Sioeng when they sat together at a May
1996 fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee in Washington
D.C. But Locke couldn't have known that the star-studded event,
which featured President Clinton, would ultimately lead to a
federal deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Two months after the dinner, during a fund-raising swing through
L.A. in late July, Locke visited Sioeng at his newspaper, the
International Daily News. Locke said his picture was taken with
Sioeng on that visit, and without his permission Sioeng used the
photo in his newspaper. That accompanying article said that Sioeng
was working as a fundraiser for Locke, according to the
Congressional committee investigator.
</P>
<P>
   Locke said that Sioeng offered to hold a fund-raiser in L.A.,
but never followed through. He said Sioeng never worked for him as
a paid fundraiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had no role in my campaign,'' said Locke. ``He offered to
put on a fundraiser for us but never did.''

EDITORIAL: A HEALTHY TURN FOR CHINA'S ARMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Aug. 6:
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 20 years, China's army has become almost as
formidable a force in the Chinese economy as it is in military
affairs. Encouraged by the government to supplement official
defense budgets with profits from army-owned businesses, the
military developed a multibillion-dollar empire of some 15,000
companies, including clothing manufacturers, airlines and hotels as
well as defense-related industries.
</P>
<P>
   In July, President Jiang Zemin ordered the army to sever its
connections with these companies, with some of the lost revenues to
be replaced by increased government spending. His initiative should
reinforce China's economic and budgetary reforms, strengthen
civilian authority over army leaders and create a more professional
military, less likely to intervene in political affairs or
complicate relations between China and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Having army-owned businesses sell defense equipment to the
military invited corruption. Army businesses also proved ideal
conduits for smuggling, with their ability to move luxury goods
undetected across borders. The financial cushion provided by these
businesses also made military leaders dangerously independent of
government control and individually rich and powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Since consolidating power last fall Jiang has put forward a
surprisingly ambitious agenda of reforms, including closing
unprofitable state industries, reducing government bureaucracy and,
now, extricating the army from business. He has also encouraged a
limited debate about introducing more democracy into China's
authoritarian political system.
</P>
<P>
   These are promising steps, pointing toward a better governed,
more market-oriented and slightly freer China. China now has a
leader with a reform plan and the political authority to put it
into effect.

BELIEVE IT OR NOT! MARINO ON THE RUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ No need to rub your eyes and blink this fall.
Believe it. The most productive passer in National Football League
history will be quarterbacking a run-oriented offense.
</P>
<P>
   Miami coach Jimmy Johnson broke the news to Dan Marino on the
flight home from Foxboro, Mass., last season after the Dolphins'
17-3 first-round playoff loss to New England.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson says the biggest mistake he has made since arriving in
Miami was not making the run a key part of the offense from the
beginning. He says his next biggest blunder was not doing it in his
second season.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in his third year, Johnson has simplified the playbook,
vowing 3 yards and a cloud of dust.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all that we're practicing and all that we're doing, it's
truly a sink or swim on the running game,'' Johnson said earlier
this week at training camp; Miami had the highest pass-to-run ratio
in the league last season.
</P>
<P>
   If, by season's end, the Dolphins wind up passing 80 or 90 times
more than they run, the coach believes his new approach will have
failed.
</P>
<P>
   Where does all this leave Marino, who turns 37 on Sept. 15 and
has amassed 55,416 passing yards, nearly 7,000 more than his
closest competitor? In a word, eager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said for the last six or seven years: I want to play and
win, and it's whatever that takes,'' Marino said Wednesday at his
locker-room cubicle at Nova Southeastern University.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean the Dolphins plan for Marino to keep his arm
idle at his side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to throw the ball,'' he said. ``I think what you
look for is what Dallas had with Aikman when they were playing
good. Even when we were. You're running the ball for more than 100
yards, and that helps you be efficient with your passing
attempts.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino's not-too-distant memory tells him the Dolphins once
could be successful with a freewheeling passing game, where 40 or
more passes would be an average afternoon. ``But I realize to be
consistent over a long season, you've got to be able to play good
defense and run the football, not turn it over,'' he said. ``That's
where we're headed, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictability, in a simplified offense _ where audibles will be
dramatically reduced _ would appear to be a concern. Johnson shrugs
off that notion by salivating over the edge his blockers will have
by knowing the play, their assignments and the snap count before
they even reach the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way this offense is set up, from what I've seen so far,
it's less predictable than what we had,'' Marino said. ``We can run
the same play four different ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season the leading rusher was Karim Abdul-Jabbar, who ran
for 892 yards but had only a 3.2-yard average. As a team, Miami
averaged just 3.1 yards a game.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Phillips, expected to help, was released last month.
Johnson will rely on the No. 1 draft pick, John Avery of
Mississippi, who is 5 feet 9 inches and 190 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson promises a marked reduction in the team's shotgun
formation, which Marino likes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see us continue to use that as much as we can,''
Marino said. ``It'll be there for us if we want it. I guess it'll
depend on what's happening week to week.''
</P>
<P>
   As Marino headed out the door for his 16th training camp, his
wife Claire told him that their oldest son, Daniel Charles, who
will be 12 next month, is closer in age to many of the Dolphins
than his father is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Thanks a lot for that information,''' Marino said,
chuckling.
</P>
<P>
   Turning serious, he added: ``Really, age is just a number. I
feel pretty good. I think as far as my skills go _ movement, arm
strength _ everything is still there. I can still make all the
throws I need to make and the velocity is just as good as it's ever
been.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Marino has begun savoring the game more. This is
despite coming into a season where he faces more doubters than
ever, products of his advancing age, injuries and his relative
immobility in an era of mobile quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn to appreciate what you're doing and what you've done
in the game,'' he said. ``After I hurt my Achilles, that kind of
woke me up a little bit. The game you've been playing since you
were a little kid could end at any time. You might never get a
chance to play it again. So I do appreciate that part of it.''
Marino ruptured his Achilles' tendon in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs, too, that Marino has mellowed from his
fire-eating days of bristling at almost anybody who erred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you make a couple of plays for him, you're kind of on his
good side,'' wide receiver Lamar Thomas said. ``Then it's more
like, `Help me out a little bit, I'm an old man.''' &QL;

TWO TEEN MOTHERS TO SUE OVER HONOR SOCIETY EXPULSION 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   COVINGTON, Ky. _ Two 17-year-old high school students who say
they were denied membership in the National Honor Society because
they were pregnant are planning to sue their school board in
federal court here on grounds of sexual discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union, which is to file suit for
the girls on Thursday, says it sees the case as a way to seek wider
enforcement of federal laws banning sex discrimination because of
pregnancy in high school.
</P>
<P>
   The two girls, Somer Chipman and Chasity Glass, both 17 and top
students at Grant County High School in nearby Williamstown, are
raising their daughters as they prepare for their senior year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chipman plans to marry the father, a 21-year-old worker at
an oil-change shop, on Friday. Ms. Glass lives with her mother; her
daughter's father, who has just graduated, helps with child care
and plans to join the National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Both girls, like many residents in their community _ a rural,
tobacco-growing area where alcohol sales are banned _ say they were
wrong to have engaged in premarital sex, but consider abortion a
far greater sin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake,'' Ms. Glass said, bouncing her daughter,
Shelby, on her lap. ``It's just that others haven't gotten
caught.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Ruberg, lawyer for the Grant County Board of Education,
said that given the county's conservative nature, denying
membership to the two girls was neither surprising nor
controversial for most residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the fact that character is one of the criteria,'' Ruberg
said by telephone, ``the admissions committee did not feel that
someone who had engaged in premarital sex should be held up as a
role model for the rest of the students to emulate, whether male or
female.''
</P>
<P>
   ACLU lawyer Sara Mandelbaum said it was precisely the fact that
boys who engaged in premarital sex faced no such exclusion that
made the girls' rejection an act of sex discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's making a girl wear a scarlet P and bear the burden for
something that is a joint activity,'' she said.

Marlins humble Astros' Hampton
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
MIAMI _ The tale of two halves continues for Mike Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   During a 2{-month stretch to begin the season, Hampton was
almost untouchable _ 7-2 with a 2.52 ERA in 12 starts _ in picking
up where he left off in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, it's been the unthinkable. The Astros have lost six of
Hampton's seven starts since he returned from the disabled list in
early July, including Wednesday's 5-3 setback to the Florida
Marlins in front of 19,038 at Pro Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   After failing to pitch beyond the fifth inning for the third
time since he returned from a strained left groin July 4, Hampton
was short on answers _ and patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had a good outing since I came off the disabled
list,'' said Hampton, who missed two starts after injuring himself
at Cincinnati on June 15. ``I'm not a good pitcher right now. I
have to do something to get back and help this team win some games.
It's time I stepped up.''
</P>
<P>
   The same can be said for the Astros, who dropped two of three
games to Florida and on Friday begin a 10-game homestand that
includes meetings with Philadelphia and National League Central
rivals Chicago and Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros won the season series with the Marlins 6-3 but have
lost 16 of their last 19 games in South Florida. They are 9-21
overall against the Marlins on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem like it should be that difficult, not just
because they are rebuilding their team or anything,'' Astros
manager Larry Dierker said of beating the Marlins, owners of the
worst record in the major leagues at 41-74. ``We have an easier
time in Atlanta than we do here. It's one of those places you
appreciate any win you can get.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of unraveled here. If we're going to be a championship
team, we need to try and win this kind of series.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether against the Marlins or Braves, Hampton (9-6) is looking
for any sign of consistency to get back on track. In five-plus
innings Wednesday, the lefthander allowed five runs (four earned),
seven hits and three walks, and he made a costly throwing error
that provided Florida an insurance run in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton is 1-3 with a 6.53 ERA in his past seven starts and has
allowed 29 earned runs in his last 40 innings. Hampton ran into
problems from the outset as Florida scored four runs in the first
three innings, including three on a third-inning homer by rookie
Derrek Lee that put the Astros in a 4-0 hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never got into a rhythm,'' Hampton said. ``There was nothing
good about my performance. I didn't throw strikes. I didn't execute
at all. I had terrible location. There's nothing I can say. It was
a struggle from the first inning on, and it showed.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, after playing into the early morning following a rain
delay of nearly two hours preceding Tuesday night's game, the
Astros' offense forgot to turn on the alarm clock. Marlins
23-year-old rookie Jesus Sanchez (5-6) held the Astros to one
earned run _ a solo homer by Sean Berry in the seventh _ and only
two extra-base hits in the game. He had a three-hit shutout for 5
innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros scored two unearned runs in the sixth. With two out,
Ricky Gutierrez reached first on an error, and Derek Bell reached
on an infield single. Jeff Bagwell, who had two hits Wednesday and
batted .400 on the six-game road trip, hit a two-run double to
left-center.
</P>
<P>
   That was about the extent of the good news for the Astros.
Center fielder Carl Everett left the game in the bottom of the
fourth with a strained left quadriceps muscle he sustained while
running out a grounder in the top of the inning. He is day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a long night (Tuesday), and I think it showed,'' said
Tim Bogar, who started at second base in place of Craig Biggio,
whose streak of 494 consecutive games ended. ``We didn't rebound
well. The kid pitched really well, but he shouldn't have beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez had a little help.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros had runners at second and third with one out in the
second but could not score any runs after an unusual play killed
the threat. Moises Alou led off with a walk and Berry singled with
one out. Tony Eusebio struck out on a pitch in the dirt that rolled
away from catcher Mike Redmond. Alou tried to score from third, but
Sanchez retrieved the ball and flipped it to Redmond, who tagged
Alou for the third out.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, Florida third baseman Kevin Orie snagged a
hard-hit grounder by Alou to turn an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins, already ahead 4-2, added a run in the sixth. After
walking two straight batters, Hampton threw Redmond's comebacker
into center field when trying to start a double play, allowing John
Wehner to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take those three plays away, and it turns the score around
real easy,'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   Astros relievers combined for three scoreless innings. It was to
no avail as Florida's Antonio Alfonseca and Matt Mantei retired the
final six Houston batters. Mantei struck out the side in the ninth
for his sixth save of the season.

<P>
   Kashmir, the Himalayan paradise ravaged by nine years of
guerrilla war, has for centuries inspired passionate (and florid)
description, but none more so than from its most famous son,
Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like some supremely beautiful woman, whose beauty is almost
impersonal and above human desire, such was Kashmir in all its
feminine beauty of river and valley and lake and graceful trees,''
Nehru rhapsodized in his autobiography. ``It was like the face of
the beloved that one sees in a dream and that fades away on
awakening.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us, oddly enough, down to earth in Danbury, Conn.,
and the very American executive suite of M. Farooq Kathwari, 53,
the Kashmir-born chief of Ethan Allen Inc. In the last five years,
Kathwari has transformed the company from a dowdy maker of Colonial
furniture into a successful purveyor of country French sleigh beds
and computer hutches.
</P>
<P>
   That's one story about Kathwari. Here is another one, made more
urgent by recent developments. Briefly, the plot runs like this:
</P>
<P>
   Onetime cricket-playing princeling of prominent Kashmiri
business family becomes a student activist in his homeland,
protests Indian rule, is jailed briefly, then arrives in the United
States in 1965 at 20, a political refugee. Peddles $10,000 of his
family's handicrafts (sent to him in wicker baskets by his
grandfather) as he climbs on Wall Street. Now he runs a company
with 7,000 employees and an estimated $670 million in annual
revenue as he tries to broker a solution between India and Pakistan
over their disputed border region and his beloved homeland,
suddenly a potential flash point for nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want either India or Pakistan to fight,'' Kathwari
said last week. ``They should sit down and control their egos and
their emotions and find a solution that they can live with. And
also an honorable solution for the people of Kashmir.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he considers himself Indian or Kashmiri, Kathwari, an
American citizen, responded swiftly: ``Oh, a Kashmiri. Never an
Indian.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Kathwari formed the Kashmir Study Group, an influential
team of American scholars, politicians, business executives and
former diplomats that is trying to provide ``constructive ideas''
for the Kashmiri dispute. The dispute started a half-century ago,
when the British Empire was carved up into India and Pakistan and
Kashmir was literally caught in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Kashmir, predominantly Muslim, went to India, and two wars
resulted. Today India still controls Kashmir, Pakistan rejects the
possession and most Kashmiris want independence. Since 1989,
Kashmiri rebels, some backed by Pakistan, have sought their own
state in an insurgency that has cost 40,000 lives. This spring, the
nuclear tests of India and Pakistan made the world pay a lot more
attention. Kathwari's study group recommends, for starters, that
India relax its military presence in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, you look at the problem and it is so
difficult it is almost futile to get involved,'' Kathwari said.
``But the common people of Kashmir are suffering.'' His parents,
his two brothers and his sister still live in the Kashmiri capital
of Srinagar, and he knows a dozen families that have seen husbands,
wives, children or other relatives die in the crossfire. ``The
youth of Kashmir has been lost,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kathwari is an elegant, self-contained man who speaks in the
clipped, vaguely British cadences of the Indian upper class. He
said he was motivated to create the study group out of ``a sense of
responsibility'' _ not guilt _ over his successful American life.
He spoke carefully from a deep chair in his office, decorated with
Ethan Allen's best, at the company's Danbury headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   He said a two-month trip to India and Pakistan by five study
group members last year was financed by his Irfan Kathwari
Foundation, named for his 20-year-old son who died in an accident
in 1992. Kathwari said it was too painful to talk more about it. He
has two other grown children, is married to a woman from Kashmir
and lives in New Rochelle, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   He got his start at a company in Queens that he thinks made
shower stalls. Whatever it was, the captain of the cricket team at
Kashmir University had never before worked for a living, and it was
not an auspicious beginning. ``My job was to help the foreman,'' he
said. ``After two weeks he called me in, gave me a check, and said,
`Please don't come in on Monday.'''
</P>
<P>
   He did better at New York University's business school, then got
a job as a financial analyst at Bear Stearns, worked at New Court
Securities (now Rothschild Inc.), where he was introduced to the
chairman of Ethan Allen, who complained that he couldn't get good
Kashmiri crewel-work fabric for his furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Through cousins in Kashmir, Kathwari set up a cottage industry
in crewel of consistent standards, began supplying Ethan Allen,
then formed KEA International (for Kathwari Ethan Allen), a joint
venture in lamps, carpets and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Ethan Allen bought KEA and Kathwari became an Ethan
Allen vice president. He was made chairman and chief executive in
1988, took the company public in 1993 and reinvented it as a young
and fresh furniture version of the Gap.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kathwari does not express the passions of Nehru about
Kashmir, he does have pictures in his office of his sons on horses
at Gulmarg, the beautiful Kashmiri resort. Kathwari used to go
every summer, before the recent troubles.

SEX SHOPS HOPE TO SURVIVE BY FOLLOWING NEW RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Despite a string of resounding legal victories by
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's administration in its effort to curb New
York City's sex industry, the vast majority of 144 adult video
stores and strip clubs singled out by a new anti-sex-shop law are
investing their hopes in a novel legal strategy that a state
Supreme Court justice could either bolster or dismiss in a hearing
in Manhattan on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Who prevails in the legal battle, which is expected to generate
months of appeals, will determine whether Giuliani will be able to
eradicate much of the city's sex-shop industry or simply put a
prettier face on it.
</P>
<P>
   Herald Price Fahringer, a lawyer representing 107 of the 144 sex
shops affected by the law, said all of his clients would try to
remain open by conforming to a provision in the law that
essentially says the stores are considered X-rated enterprises if
40 percent or more of their business is in adult material.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all of them are going to try to stay in business,''
Fahringer said. ``I haven't talked to anyone who said they're going
to close up and move away.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the city, adult video stores have completed or are
planning feverish renovations and bathing-suit purchases to help
them avoid the definition of an ``adult establishment'' under the
law.
</P>
<P>
   Store and club owners have responded by selling T-shirts,
souvenirs and feature movies in 60 percent of their stores, and
selling pornography in the rest. Strip clubs say they have confined
topless dancing to less than 40 percent of their floor space.
</P>
<P>
   But city officials are expected to argue that the renovations
are little more than subterfuges to avoid the law. City officials
have refused to discuss the details of what they will present in
court Thursday. But when asked Wednesday whether it would be
acceptable for clubs to limit stripping to 40 percent of their
premises, Steven Fishner, the mayor's criminal justice coordinator,
dismissed the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't anticipate that it's going to be a change in the
utilization of the floor space,'' he said. ``We anticipate a change
in the actual use. A change from being a strip club to being some
other kind of establishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert Fredericks, a former assistant corporate counsel who
helped draft the law, said the clubs were trying to take advantage
of wording the administration had to include to make the law pass
constitutional muster.
</P>
<P>
   Mirroring measures recently enacted in other cities, the law
does not flatly outlaw the sale of pornographic materials or the
existence of strip clubs, Fredericks said. Courts have repeatedly
ruled that such bans violate free-speech guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is with the Constitution _ it cannot be banned,''
he said, referring to adult material. ``A law had to be drafted
that dealt with the problem but still allowed reasonable access to
the material.''

LaFleur bonds with Cowboys' new offense
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JODY GOLDSTEIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
When Chan Gailey marched into Dallas with his playbook, David
LaFleur couldn't have been happier.
</P>
<P>
   Page after page was filled with plays for the tight end. Some
were passes to catch, some were blocks to throw and some even
featured two tight ends. It was quite a departure from the Cowboys'
I-formation that hadn't throw a lot of passes that way since Jay
Novacek retired.
</P>
<P>
   And it took only minutes to realize that the plays work. The
Cowboys' first team ran only 12 plays in its first exhibition game,
but one of the most crucial was a 26-yard reception by LaFleur
during a 60-yard touchdown drive. The second-year tight end also
threw a key block on Chris Warren's 15-yard touchdown run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love (the new offense),'' LaFleur said. ``It's something
that I feel comfortable with. I've been doing this pretty much for
five years (including his college days at Louisiana State). It's
pretty much the same stuff. All the running plays and pretty much
the same routes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to change my role a lot because the running plays
are pretty much geared toward the tight-end side of the ball. I'm
going to be called on a lot more in the running game at the point
of attack. That's a pretty big change from last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Both plays _ the catch and the huge block _ didn't escape the
notice of Gailey, who said he saw LaFleur's potential immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``From watching tape from last year to this preseason game, he's
made a nice step,'' the new Cowboys coach said. ``He's got some
more to go, but he made a nice step.
</P>
<P>
   ``David's development is very important to us this season. We
look for him to make a big jump in production from last year, and
if he does, it will really help our offense.''
</P>
<P>
   After a series of busts with their first draft choice, the
Cowboys used their top pick for LaFleur in 1997. His rookie numbers
weren't astounding _ 18 catches for 122 yards _ but LaFleur showed
marked improvement as the season progressed. When Eric Bjornson's
fractured fibula created playing time for LaFleur, he responded by
catching 11 balls for two touchdowns in the final four games. The
two scores came against the Cincinnati Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, it took me awhile to get adjusted,'' LaFleur said.
``It was something totally new for me, something I had never been
asked to do. But I think I showed in (the Bengals) game what I'm
capable of doing. It's a matter of working on the same page with
Troy (Aikman) and having him get confidence in me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every day we are out there learning each other. I
definitely feel more comfortable than I was at this point last
year, particularly in the passing game.''
</P>
<P>
   That comfort level is progressing on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing well,'' Aikman said. ``He's getting a lot of reps.
He and Eric are both being asked to do quite a bit of what the
fullbacks do, and they're doing a great job. I think David is going
to work well in this scheme. He is tall and makes a great target. I
think we'll be going to him much more this season.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6-7 and 280 pounds, the Cowboys are excited about LaFleur's
blocking potential, particularly over the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the reasons everyone talks about him possibly
being a prototype tight end,'' said tight ends coach Les Miles.
``He's big, he's strong, he's fast and he has great hands. I think
it's warranted when people suggest, in time, he could be as good as
there is.''
</P>
<P>
   LaFleur's development will allow the Cowboys to use Bjornson as
an extra receiver when they go into their four- and five-receiver
sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric can catch the ball and will be in there a lot,
particularly on obvious passing downs,'' LaFleur said. ``But I also
think my name will be called in the huddle a little more. Eric and
I work well together. We want the same thing, a winning season. The
last part of last season wasn't a lot of fun.''

THIRD TUNNEL SET TO SEND WATER TO CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Next week, New Yorkers will finally taste the results
of one of the longest-running, most expensive projects in city
history. Water from the Third Water Tunnel _ a $6 billion
undertaking conceived in the 1950's and begun in the Lindsay
administration, whose final stages may not be completed until 2020
_ will at last flow from faucets in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The connection of the first 13 {-mile segment of the new water
tunnel to distribution pipes in parts of the Bronx, Manhattan and
Queens is a major milestone for the project, which has long been
billed as the biggest public works project in America. The third
tunnel is crucial for two reasons, according to city officials and
outside experts.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, it provides a safeguard in case of a
catastrophic breakdown in one of the other tunnels, insuring that
the city, which uses 1.4 billion to 1.5 billion gallons of water a
day, would still be able to carry sufficient water to residents.
The existence of a third tunnel will also finally give engineers an
opportunity to inspect the state of the other two tunnels, which
have never been examined since water began to flow through them in
1917 and 1937.
</P>
<P>
   City officials are planning a ceremony next Thursday to mark the
tunnel's opening. The ceremony will also honor the 24 underground
workers, known as sandhogs, who have died working on the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   The first segment stretches from the Hillview Reservoir in
Yonkers through the Bronx and Manhattan and under the East River to
Roosevelt Island and, finally, Astoria.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the second phase of the vast project began in
Brooklyn's Red Hook section and has worked its way to Queens, where
it linked up with a section already under construction there. Three
more segments, one into Manhattan, another to Kensico Reservoir in
Westchester County and a third to parts of the Bronx and Queens _
all part of the overall Third Water Tunnel project _ remain to be
built.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the vast project has met with its share of
criticism and skepticism. &UR;  &LR; Construction has been delayed several
times because of a lack of money. During the mid-1970s,
construction stopped for two years during the city's fiscal crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The third tunnel ``provides the spare tire,'' said George Fox,
the retired chairman and president of Grow Tunneling, which built
much of the third tunnel. It will also enable engineers to inspect
the two older tunnels, which have never been shut off. Without a
backup, shutting down even one tunnel for inspection would cause
severe water shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Water pressure should be improved thanks to the new tunnel,
particularly at the system's extremities, experts said. The reason
is that the two current tunnels are carrying as much as 60 percent
more water than they were designed to handle. And as greater
quantities of water are squeezed in, they lose speed because of
gravity, Fox said.

CHECKING OUT THOSE 15 MINUTES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES BARRON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Andy Warhol is famous for making a cultural icon of a
tomato-soup can and for predicting that ``in the future everyone
will be world-famous for 15 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Now even the places where famous prediction-makers lived are
famous for 15 minutes. Not 14 minutes and 30 seconds, not 15
minutes and 10 seconds, but exactly 15 minutes, as proved by a
digital clock that ticked off the 900 seconds Wednesday outside the
town house at 57 E. 66th St. where Warhol lived from 1974 until his
death in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The countdown _ celebrating the 70th anniversary of Warhol's
birth _ was part of a sidewalk gathering organized by Barbaralee
Diamonstein-Spielvogel's Historic Landmarks Preservation Center, a
private, nonprofit group that tries to draw attention to what it
considers overlooked landmarks. Ms. Spielvogel, who said that her
organization's plaque was the first memorial to Warhol in New York,
was joined by Vincent Fremont, a warhol confidant, and Bob
Colacello, a founder of Warhol's Interview magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The town house was far from the downtown art world that Warhol
put on the map, and he liked it that way: His house was a refuge.
There was talk at the unveiling that Warhol left the house littered
with tape-recorder batteries, Polaroid film and acne medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be fair to say Andy was a consistent, not compulsive,
shopper,'' Ms. Spielvogel said. ``Vincent Fremont told me that he
found many shopping bags stuffed with objects that had never been
taken out of the shopping bags, including presents Vincent had
given to him.''

EDITORIAL: GIVING RENO TIME TO STUDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Aug. 6:
</P>
<P>
   Charles La Bella and Louis Freeh, the Justice Department's top
authorities on campaign fund-raising abuses, have now testified
publicly that federal law requires the appointment of an
independent counsel to investigate allegations of financial abuses
in President Clinton's 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, they explained, is that Attorney General Janet Reno
has a conflict of interest that makes it impossible for her to
supervise honestly an investigation of the man who appointed her.
</P>
<P>
   The legal reasoning is correct and obvious to everyone but Reno.
She has said that she needs three weeks to study the report drafted
by La Bella, the former head of the Justice Department's campaign
finance task force.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's attorney general should not need so long to master
basic law, but we think it is better to give her the time than to
hold her in contempt of Congress, as proposed by Rep. Dan Burton,
chairman of the House Committee on government Reform and Oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Two wiser students of the Democratic campaign abuses, Sen. Orrin
Hatch and Rep. Henry Hyde, favor giving Reno the requested time so
she can think her way through this with the help of La Bella's
94-page report and a memorandum from Freeh, the director of the
FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Burton is threatening the contempt action because he wants a
look at those documents. But a confrontation over the reports would
be unsound on legal grounds and counterproductive at a time when,
thanks to Freeh and La Bella, the pressure is mounting on Reno to
get out of the way and let an independent investigation proceed.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, we can sympathize with Burton's frustration when
Reno accuses his committee of proposals that would ``risk creating
a Justice Department and an FBI that tack to political winds
instead of following the facts and the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno has given the nation a politicized Justice Department.
Freeh and La Bella have given her reports that instruct her in how
to straighten out that department. Everyone in Washington knows
what the law requires. The Freeh and La Bella reports give Reno a
reasonable, if belated, way to clean up her mistake.

 &HT;    BIG TEXAS CONTRIBUTOR SAYS DELAY COACHED HIM
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON and ANDY ADAMS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Minority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, has been
sideswiped by a nasty split between an East Texas congressional
candidate and the candidate's biggest supporter in a 1996 race.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Cloeren Jr. of Orange, Texas, was the biggest supporter of
Republican dentist Brian Babin in his 1996 race against Democrat
Jim Turner, whom Babin is running against again this year.
</P>
<P>
   Cloeren gave Babin $37,000 in illegal contributions for his 1996
race, far in excess of the limit of $1,000 per individual for
direct contributions to a federal campaign. He did that by
convincing some of his employees to write $1,000 checks to Babin,
and then arranged for his company to reimburse them.
</P>
<P>
   After Cloeren cooperated with the FBI in tape-recording his
conversations with Babin and others, and pleaded guilty to two
misdemeanor counts, Cloeren and his company were each sentenced to
pay a $200,000 fine. Nobody else was charged in the case, and U.S.
Attorney Mike Bradford in Beaumont specifically noted that he was
not pursuing any case against Babin.
</P>
<P>
   Cloeren admits being upset that he was singled out, and that
Babin kept the $37,000. This week, Cloeren charged in a written
complaint to the Federal Election Commission that Babin helped him
break the law, and broke other election laws besides.
</P>
<P>
   According to a copy of those charges given by Cloeren to Cox
Newspapers, DeLay also introduced him to at least one of the
experts who showed him sophisticated methods of slipping around the
law's limits. Cloeren said he and his wife used those methods for
another $27,000 in questionable expenditures that benefitted
Babin's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Cloeren's version of what happened was reported in great detail
Wednesday in The Hill, a political newspaper in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to hear what Cloeren has to say about the Republicans,
investigators from the Democratic minority on the House committee
that has spent months examining illegal or questionable activities
of the Democrats arranged to question Cloeren in Houston on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My campaign has complied fully with FEC guidelines and
rules,'' Babin said. ``Although my heart goes out to Mr. Cloeren, I
cannot be held responsible for what someone else was done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Cloeren's allegations are completely false,'' said DeLay's
press secretary, Mike Scanlon. ``One thing you have to remember is
this gentleman is guilty of committing a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   They did admit that Cloeren paid for a charter flight that DeLay
took on a short campaign swing from his home in Sugar Land to help
Babin in Orange on Aug. 29, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an oversight,'' said Babin, who last week reimbursed
Cloeren with a $1,320 personal check. ``We thought Mr. DeLay's
office was going to make an in-kind contribution to us (by paying
for the flight itself) and he thought we were going to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Cloeren said he had lunch that day at the Orange Sunset Grove
Country Club with DeLay and Babin and about a half-dozen other
people, including Delay's campaign manager, Robert Mills.
</P>
<P>
   Versions of what happened at that lunch vary greatly.
</P>
<P>
   Cloeren said that when he complained that he was out of
``vehicles'' for giving $1,000 contributions to Babin's campaign,
DeLay said Mills would get back to him on ``other organizations and
campaigns that we could work through to raise those vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay didn't say that, and doesn't recall any other details of
his own remarks, which were casual and social, Scanlon said. Babin
said he remembered being at the table, but doesn't recall what was
said, and didn't hear what DeLay and Cloeren were saying to each
other.
</P>
<P>
   In charges denied by Mills, Cloeren said that Mills later called
him and explained two methods of getting around the $1,000 limit:
He could give $1,000 to another campaign, and one of its
contributors would give $1,000 to Babin, or he could give to a
political action committee that would help Babin.
</P>
<P>
   Cloeren supplied documents showing that he and his wife did give
$2,000 to congressional campaigns in Tennessee and North Carolina
whose supporters helped Babin, $5,000 to a political action
committee that contributed $5,000 to Babin and $20,000 to another
group that paid for ads criticizing Babin's opponent, Jim Turner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mills has never even spoken to him, and wouldn't know the man
if he bit him on the nose,'' Scanlon said.
</P>
<P>
   Defending his credibility, Cloeren said, ``You can look in files
and I'd never been involved in politics at all before. And within
one month after DeLay's visit, I'd given $25,000 to (the pro-Babin
and anti-Turner) organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it was two months. Photocopies show that $20,000 of
the checks were dated Nov. 1 and deposited Nov. 4.

PETER PAN IS ABDUCTED, WITH NARY A TRACE OF PIXIE DUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Peter Pan has disappeared. Virtually under the nose
of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, guardian of the city's civility, a
nearly five-foot-tall bronze statue of the little boy who wouldn't
grow up was stolen overnight Wednesday from a grotto in Carl Schurz
Park at East End Avenue and 86th Street, where it had charmed
visitors for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the original young Pan was known for flying away,
frequently in a sprinkling of pixie dust. But his absence
Wednesday, from a small glade shaded by a London plane tree just a
short stroll from Gracie Mansion, the official mayoral residence,
bore sinister signs of foul play.
</P>
<P>
   The statue was made by Charles Andrew Hafner in 1928 and showed
the slender youth in his distinctive feathered cap and belted tunic
sitting on a tree stump with a fawn, a rabbit and a toad at his
feet. It had been cut off its stone base and weighed about a
thousand pounds, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   `'We're very unhappy about it,'' Parks Commissioner Henry Stern
said. `'This is one of the most beautiful spots in the park. We'd
like to appeal to whoever took him to return him to a place where
he was happy and if anyone has seen Peter Pan to let us know. He
was very important to a lot of people and delighted generations of
children.
</P>
<P>
   `'It's a very sad thing,'' he said, ``and certainly not in the
spirit of Peter Pan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought his only enemy was Captain Hook,'' the commissioner
added.
</P>
<P>
   At the crime scene late Wednesday afternoon, two detectives were
solemnly dusting plastic water bottles for fingerprints and
searching for other evidence. The squarish stone base of the statue
lay several feet away from the circular flower bed where it had
stood since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   There were no ransom notes, nor had any demands been issued,
Stern said. Indeed, the motivation seemed as mysterious as the
statue-napping itself. A cult of Captain Hook devotees, perhaps? A
bias crime by grown-ups?
</P>
<P>
   The statue had originally been part of a fountain in the old
Paramount Theater in Times Square and was given to the city.
</P>
<P>
   When Lewis Burke Frumkes, a humorist and host of a radio show on
the arts and sciences, wrote about the city's public gardens for
The New York Times in 1993, he described that part of Carl Schurz
Park as ``a little Neverland.'' He added, ``I am particularly fond
of the Peter Pan Garden because it is rather unspoiled and
uncrowded.''

TWO TEEN MOTHERS TO SUE OVER HONOR SOCIETY EXPULSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Adds baby's age in 4th graf; Spelling of Chasity in 3rd graf

(nk) 
 By ETHAN BRONNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COVINGTON, Ky. _ Two 17-year-old high school students who say
they were denied membership in the National Honor Society because
they were pregnant are planning to sue their school board in
federal court here on grounds of sexual discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union, which is to file suit for
the girls on Thursday, says it sees the case as a way to seek wider
enforcement of federal laws banning sex discrimination due to
pregnancy in high school.
</P>
<P>
   The two girls, Somer Chipman and Chasity Glass, both 17 and top
students at Grant County High School in nearby Williamstown, are
raising their daughters as they prepare for their senior year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chipman, whose 2-month-old daughter's name is Cheyenne,
plans to marry the father, a 21-year-old worker at an oil-change
shop, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Glass lives with her mother with her 15-month-old daughter,
Shelby. The baby's father, who just graduated, helps with child
care and plans to join the National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Both girls, like many residents in their community, a rural,
tobacco-growing area where alcohol sales are banned, say they were
wrong to have engaged in premarital sex but consider abortion a far
greater sin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake,'' Ms. Glass said, bouncing Shelby on her
lap, in the office of a local lawyer. ``It's just that others
haven't gotten caught.''
</P>
<P>
   Her lawyer, Sara Mandelbaum of the ACLU, described the case this
way: ``It's making a girl wear a scarlet P and bear the burden for
something that is a joint activity. No boy is being left out of the
society for having engaged in premarital sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Admission to the National Honor Society, which recognizes
outstanding high school students, is based on national guidelines
but is under the direct authority of local chapters. Boards of
teachers choose members according to scholarship, character,
service and leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chipman, whose grade-point average is 3.9 on a scale of 4.0,
and Ms. Glass, with 3.7, were never officially told why, out of 33
students with the required academic record, they were the only ones
to have been denied entry to the National Honor Society. When they
demanded an explanation, they were simply told that they had not
met the criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Both girls have been exemplary students, earning top marks in
such courses as ``advanced placement'' English and chemistry, and
have won local and state awards. Ms. Chipman and Ms. Glass say
membership in the National Honor Society has been a lifelong goal.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Ruberg, lawyer for the Grant County Board of Education,
said that given the county's conservative nature, denying
membership to the two girls was neither surprising nor
controversial for most residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the fact that character is one of the criteria,'' Ruberg
said by telephone, ``the admissions committee did not feel that
someone who had engaged in premarital sex should be held up as a
role model for the rest of the students to emulate, whether male or
female.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruberg added that if paternity was known, through birth
certificates or lawsuits, boys would also be excluded from
membership in the National Honor Society.
</P>
<P>
   According to the organization's handbook, under ``provisions of
federal law, pregnancy _ whether within or without wedlock _ cannot
be the basis for automatic denial of the right to participate in
any public school activity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It may properly be considered, however, like any other
circumstance, as a factor to be assessed in determining character
as it applies to the National Honor Society,'' the handbook adds.
``But pregnancy may be taken into account in determining character
only if evidence of paternity is similarly regarded.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mandelbaum said it was precisely the fact that boys who
engaged in premarital sex faced no such exclusion that made the
girls' rejection an act of sex discrimination and a violation of
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and the Equal
Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time that pregnancy has been an issue in
membership in the National Honor Society. Earlier this year, a girl
in Xenia, Ohio, complained that she had been expelled from her
local chapter after becoming pregnant, said Patricia Scanlon, of
the department of student activities at the National Association of
Secondary School Principals, which oversees the honor society.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, a Pennsylvania girl who was expelled from an honor
society over a pregnancy lost her challenge in federal court, but
in Illinois in 1985, a similar federal lawsuit was successful. Ms.
Scanlon said chapters around the country had allowed pregnant girls
to become members.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Yeager, an editor at The Grant County News, which has a
weekly circulation of 5,000, said letters to the newspaper were
evenly divided in supporting and opposing the honor society.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chipman said she had received numerous letters of
encouragement. Ms. Glass said she also sensed much community
support, adding: ``Times are changing. Not all teen mothers are
stereotypes. I want to be a teacher. I didn't drop out of school.
But I'm not recommending this.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Glass said she hoped to take part in a local committee that
urges the postponing of sexual activity among high school students
and use her own case as an example.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't give up my daughter for the world,'' she said,
``but I want to tell others how expensive it is, how much work it
is. That's how I want to be a role model.''

SUSPECTS IN DISAPPEARANCE ARE ARRAIGNED FOR FRAUD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sante Kimes is being called a prime suspect in the
mysterious disappearance of an Upper East Side millionaire widow,
but as Mrs. Kimes was led into a Manhattan courtroom Wednesday to
be arraigned on lesser fraud charges with her son and co-defendant,
Kenneth, she had something else on her mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't make me look like a monster this time,'' Mrs. Kimes, 63,
told the courtroom artists who were busily sketching the
arraignment, where cameras are prohibited. ``I'm a mother. I'm
innocent. My son's innocent. Would it help you if I turned
around?''
</P>
<P>
   Jane Rosenberg, one of the sketch artists, said she was taken
aback. ``She was sitting in the first seat of the jury box, just
after she came out of the well, when she turned and spoke to me,''
Ms. Rosenberg said. Another artist, Christine Cornell, said she
found the appeal persuasive. ``I tried to make her look better,''
she said. ``I felt more compassionate for her.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kimeses were arraigned in state Supreme Court in Manhattan
on Wednesday on charges that they fraudulently obtained a credit
card in the name of a Florida businessman and then used the card to
buy toiletries at a Chanel boutique and to charge drinks and
dinners at luxury hotels like the Pierre and the Park Lane. Both
Mrs. Kimes and her son, 23, pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The fraud charges were unrelated to the case of Irene Silverman,
an 82-year-old widow who vanished mysteriously on July 5 from her
luxurious town house on East 65th Street, but they allow New York
officials to keep the Kimeses in custody while investigating the
disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Although investigators fear Mrs. Silverman is dead, they have
yet to find her body. And a battery of forensic tests _ of blood
spots, hair samples and saliva stains _ have failed to place Mrs.
Silverman with the Kimeses after her disappearance, law-enforcement
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kimeses' lawyers have vigorously denied that their clients
had anything to do with the disappearance. ``There isn't an iota of
evidence, there isn't a scintilla of proof that connects them to
the disappearance of Mrs. Silverman,'' said Mel Sachs, who
represents Kenneth Kimes.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs and Jose Muniz, who represents Mrs. Kimes, complained in
court that they were not allowed to request bail for the Kimeses.
Judge Herbert Adlerberg said that they could not seek bail, because
the Kimeses had not yet been fingerprinted on the fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the criminal procedure _ you look it up,'' Adlerberg
said, slamming a copy of the New York State Criminal Procedure Law
onto the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs and Muniz complained after the arraignment that the
prosecution was using the fingerprint issue as a stalling tactic to
keep the Kimeses in custody until after Wednesday, when they are
due back in court for a hearing to decide whether they must be
extradited to Utah on a bad-check charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been in custody _ it will be 30 days tomorrow,'' Sachs
said. ``During that time there was ample opportunity to take
fingerprints, which they have. But this gives them another two days
to keep them locked up, incarcerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials said it is standard to wait until
after an arraignment to fingerprint suspects.

RUMORS THAT N.Y. ARCHIVES COULD BE CLOSED PROMPT CONCERN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Kan.)   (mk) 
 By BARBARA STEWART   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When John Carlin, director of the National Archives,
alludes to the fate of the New York branch, he uses words like
consolidation and space planning.
</P>
<P>
   But historians, genealogists and other researchers are worried
that he plans to shut the New York archives and move its billions
of records out of state. The most likely spot, they worry, is
Kansas City, Mo., where tax and other federal records from a
Bayonne, N.J., archive that closed last week are now being sent.
</P>
<P>
   The New York archives contain some 67,000 cartons filled with
documents, from court filings on the Titanic, Julius and Ethel
Rosenberg and Alger Hiss to lists of immigrants arriving at Ellis
Island and records of naturalized citizens. A treasure trove for
local researchers, the archives also contain such eclectic
documents as copies of federal theater projects from the Depression
and a signed copy of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s ``I Have
a Dream'' speech.
</P>
<P>
   Concern about the possible loss of the archives is shared by
Gov. George Pataki and Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., each
of whom wrote to Carlin recently and expressed strong opposition to
any plans to close the local operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rumors have been abounding for two years that they're planning
to move archives from around the country,'' said Estelle Guzik,
president of the Jewish Genealogical Society, referring to the 13
regional branches. ``High on the list is the rumor that New York is
one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   But Susan Cooper, a spokeswoman for the National Archives, said
there was no plan to close the New York archives or move any of its
records. ``It's an urban myth,'' she said of the rumors.
</P>
<P>
   A public meeting with Carlin to discuss the fate of the New York
archives is scheduled for Thursday at 7 p.m. at the archives
building, on the corner of Varick and Houston Streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an incredibly rich historical collection,'' said Betty
Liu Hebron, a spokeswoman for the Museum of the Chinese in the
Americas. Stored in the archives, for instance, are 581 boxes of
documents relating to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, including
typed interviews with Chinese workers.
</P>
<P>
   But the rich trove of records is rapidly outgrowing its storage
spaces in New York and around the country, Ms. Cooper said. ``Our
biggest need is space,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There are general plans to consolidate archives throughout the
country, she said, adding that the rent for the New York archives
is the most expensive in the country. ``We're looking at that,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Kenneth Jackson, chairman of the history department at
Columbia University, said it was crucial that the archives remain
in New York, despite the high rent. The archives are accessible to
large numbers of people and close to academic centers near the
downtown Manhattan site, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are in the heart of one of the greatest research centers
in the world,'' added Stephen Novak, president of the Archivists
Round Table, a professional group. ``Historians, genealogists,
anthropologists, scholars of all fields come here to do research.
In New York, they complement other research groups, and that is
what makes them special.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said that talk of moving raised concerns that archives
officials ``don't know what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   That, in fact, has been a concern among many professional
researchers since Carlin, a former governor of Kansas and a Clinton
campaign supporter, was appointed the National Archivist in 1995.
His appointment was vehemently opposed by historians and
archivists.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of discontent with Carlin because he's not an
archivist,'' Novak said. ``There's a vast amount of distrust among
archives users and members of professional groups about the agency
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlin has spoken of ``working with technology,'' without
referring to New York's collections. But professional researchers
in New York said they could read between the lines: They are afraid
Carlin will move documents to a cheaper, out-of-state location and
substitute online access to some of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that everything is online is a false promise,''
Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Fay Chew Matsuda, executive director of the Museum of the
Chinese in the Americas, said: ``What do you think space planning
means? We want to stop them before they start making specific
threats. We want to make it clear: It better not be New York they
close.''

NYC SEX SHOPS TRY TO OPERATE WITHIN LAW DESIGNED TO CURB THEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Despite a string of resounding legal victories by the
Giuliani administration in its effort to curb New York City's sex
industry, the vast majority of 144 adult video stores and strip
clubs singled out by a new anti-sex shop law are investing their
hopes in a novel legal strategy that a state Supreme Court Justice
could either bolster or dismiss in a hearing in Manhattan on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Who prevails in the legal battle, which is expected to generate
months of appeals, will determine whether Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
will be able to eradicate much of the city's sex shop industry or
simply put a prettier face on it.
</P>
<P>
   Herald Price Fahringer, a lawyer representing 107 of the 144 sex
shops affected by the law, said all of his clients would try to
remain open by conforming to a provision in the law that
essentially says the stores are considered to be X-rated
enterprises if 40 percent or more of their stock or floor space is
in adult materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all of them are going to try to stay in business,''
Fahringer said. ``I haven't talked to anyone who said they're going
to close up and move away.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the city, adult video stores have completed or are
planning feverish renovations and bathing suit purchases that help
them avoid the definition of an ``adult establishment'' under the
law.
</P>
<P>
   Store and club owners have responded by selling T-shirts,
souvenirs and feature movies in 60 percent of their floor space and
pornography in the rest. Strip clubs say they have confined topless
dancing to less than 40 percent of their floor space.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday, 75 percent of the stock in Show World, a sex
emporium on Eighth Avenue near 42nd Street that for decades has
symbolized the adult-entertainment business, was dedicated to
luggage, perfume, souvenirs and other trinkets intended to capture
the tourist trade, managers said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, night in Scores, an Upper East Side strip club that
the city has so far not accused of violating the law, employees
said they were trying to have the same number of strippers dance in
the club, but in a small, curtained-off portion of it. Men in
business suits crammed the dance area, while a vast, newly created
dining area set up on the other side of the curtain was nearly
empty.
</P>
<P>
   Fahringer is expected to argue that because Show World has
changed its inventory, it should not be closed under the law.
</P>
<P>
   But city officials are expected to argue that the renovations
are little more than subterfuges meant to avoid the law. City
officials have refused to discuss the details of what they will
present in court Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked Wednesday whether it would be acceptable for
clubs to limit stripping to 40 percent of their premises, Steven
Fishner, the mayor's criminal justice coordinator, dismissed the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't anticipate that it's going to be a change in the
utilization of the floor space,'' he said. ``We anticipate a change
in the actual use. A change from being a strip club to being some
other kind of establishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert Fredericks, a former assistant corporate counsel who
helped draft the law, said the clubs were trying to take advantage
of wording the administration had to include to make the law
constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Mirroring measures recently enacted in other cities, the law
does not flatly outlaw the sale of pornographic materials or the
existence of strip clubs, Fredericks said. Courts have repeatedly
ruled that such bans are a violation of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is with the Constitution. It cannot be banned,''
he said, referring to adult material. ``A law had to be drafted
that dealt with the problem but still allowed reasonable access to
the material.''
</P>
<P>
   The zoning ordinance and other city documents have specific
language defining how the 60-40 ratio is to be applied, essentially
measuring how much floor space and inventory are devoted to adult
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   But Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, which opposes the law, said the measure was not
precise enough and created an opportunity for stores to remain
open.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens if in addition to 1,000 videos, the store is
selling 1,000 pencils?'' he said. ``Does that mean that there are
2,000 items? What about T-shirts or dolls? Is it one for one, each
T-shirt, each pencil, each doll, is that equal to one video? Do you
put them on a scale and weigh them?''
</P>
<P>
   But Fishner said Wednesday that he was confident the city would
prevail in court. He also said inspections to find grounds to close
the clubs would continue.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the clubs say that even if they win the legal
battle, it is not clear that they can remain economically viable if
they can devote so little of their floor space to adult
entertainment. ``We're all not sure whether this is going to
work,'' one Scores employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   For now, owners of the sex shops and their lawyers appear to be
awaiting the result of Thursday's hearing, which involves the
city's attempt to close six clubs: Show World; NRS XXX Video on
Eighth Avenue in midtown; the Harmony Theater and Harmony Theater
II strip clubs on Church and West 22nd Streets; Les Hommes video
store on West 80th Street, and Angel's strip club on Walker Street.
</P>
<P>
   Judges in Brooklyn and Staten Island on Wednesday granted joint
requests from city lawyers and the owners of two strip clubs
padlocked over the weekend, Wiggles and Shark's, that their cases
be adjourned for several weeks. Individuals associated with both
clubs said Wednesday that clubs owners were trying to identify ways
they could reopen under the new law.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon Kaplan, the lawyer representing El Coche, a strip club
padlocked in the Bronx last week, said its owners also hoped to
somehow reopen under the new law.

   Fredericks, who helped draft the law, said that while many U.S.
cities had laws restricting sex shops, New York's sex shop owners
might be one of the first groups to try to battle the law even as
it is being enforced. ``I think I've read just about every decision
out there,'' he said. ``There is very little out there that deals
with this.''

SEIFERT SAYS HE WON'T COACH BROWNS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Just as George Seifert's new career as a studio analyst for
``The NFL Today'' on CBS is beginning, the former San Francisco
49ers coach has to fend off the notion that he may become the coach
of the new Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   The rumors began when Carmen Policy resigned in July as the
49ers' president to join one of the groups vying to buy the Browns,
who start play in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing to it,'' Seifert said Wednesday at a CBS
National Football League seminar. ``If there was anything to it,
I'd be distracted.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``There are things the owner and the organization
want, and it may not be someone like me. Carmen wouldn't be the
sole owner.''
</P>
<P>
   About his new job, he said: ``I'm very nervous. Scared would be
the right word.''
</P>
<P>
   Seifert said that his reserved coaching persona will change.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I sit around the studio with a sour look, I won't last
until the second half hour,'' he said. ``As a coach, you speak
through your team. The team is the show. Now I'll be upfront. I'll
be part of a team that is the show.''
</P>
<P>
   His studio colleagues will be Jim Nantz, former Kansas City
running back Marcus Allen and former 49ers tight end Brent Jones.

WASHINGTON GOVERNOR A WITNESS IN CONGRESSIONAL FUND-RAISING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Fixes 4th graph: $500 million, sted $500,000 million.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington Gov. Gary Locke was secretly deposed last month by
congressional investigators looking into questionable campaign
contributions from a Hong Kong businessman, his family and his
business associates.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Locke defended his campaign, saying he has nothing to
hide.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people weren't part of any of my planned events,'' Locke
said. ``I wouldn't know them if I saw them on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic governor was drawn into the congressional inquiry
after his campaign received $5,400 from family members and
associates of Ted Sioeng, an Indonesian-born businessman,
newspaper-owner and hotelier who reportedly controls an empire
worth $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   A key target of the probe, which is trying to uncover evidence
of illegal campaign contributions from foreign nationals, Sioeng
did not donate money to Locke's 1996 gubernatorial campaign. But
Sioeng's wife, his daughter, his son-in-law and two business
associates _ all under investigation as well _ donated $5,400 to
Locke in July of 1996, records show.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first time that Locke, the nation's first
Chinese-American governor, has been asked to respond to
investigators about questionable campaign donations collected from
the Asian community.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the governor said any missteps were completely
unintentional.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did nothing wrong,'' Locke said Wednesday, speaking to
reporters after news of his sworn testimony first appeared in the
Far Eastern Economic Review, a journal of business and politics.
The governor also suggested that the inquiry based on donors'
ethnicity may be racist.
</P>
<P>
   House Reform and Oversight Committee Chairman Dan Burton, an
Indiana Republican who has been pursuing alleged fundraising
misconduct, initially considered serving Locke with a subpeona, but
the governor offered to testify under oath willingly, said Locke
spokesman Keith Love.
</P>
<P>
   During Locke's July 8 deposition, the governor said he learned
that an $1,100 contribution from Sylvana Djojomartono, a Sioeng
associate listed in campaign reports as the manager of the
Hollywood Metropolitan Hotel, was likely laundered. Locke's lawyer,
Everett Billingslea, said he saw bank records showing Sioeng's
daughter, Jessica Elnitiarta, immediately reimbursed Djojomartono
for the contribution, which is illegal. Locke said he returned that
contribution to Djojomartono July 23.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's attorneys also questioned Locke about $1,100
contributions from others close to Sioeng including, Sundari
Elnitiarta, who is Sioeng's wife and has apparently left the
country, according to a committee investigator; Kent La, the U.S.
distributor of Red Pagoda Mountain cigarettes; and Glenville
Stuart, listed in campaign reports as self employed and working at
the Sunset Market &AMP; Liquor store on Sunset Boulevard in Los
Angeles. Congressional investigators also asked about a $1,000
contribution from Ridwan Dinata, Sioeng's son-in-law who is married
to Jessica Elnitiarta and is listed in campaign reports as
president of Panda Estate Investments in Hollywood. It's a business
he co-owns with Sioeng, according to the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Elnitiarta, Stuart, or Djojomartona returned calls
seeking comment. There is no telephone listing for either La or
Dinata. Locke received all five checks on the same day, July 31,
and all five contributors are under investigation by the committee.
The checks were delivered to the Locke campaign by David Lang,
Locke's fundraising representative in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Sioeng, who investigators say has fled the country, has denied
all wrongdoing through his attorneys. But committee members suspect
Sioeng of working on behalf of Chinese government interests.
Investigators say that more than half of the $400,000 that Sioeng's
family contributed to the Democratic National Committee in 1996 was
transferred from Hong-Kong based firms.
</P>
<P>
   Locke said he has provided investigators with cancelled checks
from all four donors, but has no personal connection to them.
</P>
<P>
   Locke said he would not return the four donations unless
investigators come up with evidence that they too were illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Burton's committee also asked Locke for written explanations
concerning legal donations he got from John Huang and Pauline
Kanchanalak. Huang was a fund-raiser for the Democratic National
Committee in 1996 and a former executive of the Lippo Group, a
conglomerate controlled by the Riady banking family of Indonesia.
Democrats returned $1.6 million of the more than $3 million he
raised. Huang and his wife Jane gave Locke $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Kanchanalak is a business consultant from Thailand who was
solicited by John Huang for donations. The DNC returned all
$253,000 she contributed after she said the money was not hers. She
gave Locke $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Burton has criticized U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno's failure
to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate campaign financing.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Warheit, executive director of the state Public
Disclosure Commission, said she has been cooperating with Burton.
Now, Warheit said, she will contact the committee ``and see if
there's anything there for us'' to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Mark J. MacDougall, a Washington, D.C-based lawyer for the
Elnitiarta family, said the congressional probe, which has so far
not uncovered any vast Chinese-backed influence-peddling scheme, is
fueled by bias.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last century Congress passed laws excluding Chinese
immigrants from the United States,'' MacDougall said. ``Some in
Congress apparently still believe that Asian-Americans should not
be allowed to freely particiapte in the political process.''
</P>
<P>
   Locke acknowledged that his campaign finance staff made some
mistakes during the 1996 campaign, primarily at a series of
fundraisers targeting the Asian community in New York and
California. But, he said, said there was little he could have done
to prevent the most recent flare-up.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he doesn't know how he could have avoided
receiving the checks without subjecting his donors to questions
that were insulting at best and at worst, racist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not about to go around asking every single person... `Are
</P>
<P>
   you a U.S. citizen and was this check reimbursed?' '' Locke
said.
</P>
<P>
   Locke said he first met Sioeng when they sat together at a May
1996 fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee in Washington
D.C. But Locke couldn't have known that the star-studded event,
which featured President Clinton, would ultimately lead to a
federal deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Two months after the dinner, during a fund-raising swing through
L.A. in late July, Locke visited Sioeng at his newspaper, the
International Daily News. Locke said his picture was taken with
Sioeng on that visit, and without his permission Sioeng used the
photo in his newspaper. That accompanying article said that Sioeng
was working as a fundraiser for Locke, according to the
Congressional committee investigator.
</P>
<P>
   Locke said that Sioeng offered to hold a fund-raiser in L.A.,
but never followed through. He said Sioeng never worked for him as
a paid fundraiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had no role in my campaign,'' said Locke. ``He offered to
put on a fundraiser for us but never did.''

GREENE TO FILL ROSTER SPOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ With the Anaheim Angels designating Cecil
Fielder for assignment and clearing a spot on the roster, Todd
Greene will be activated Friday when he joins the team in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Greene hit .283 with seven homers and 20 RBI in 29 games for
Triple-A Vancouver switching his time between first base, left
field and DH. He will start in left field Friday against the White
Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Greene hasn't played in a major-league game since last Aug. 20,
when he broke his right wrist against the Yankees. The wrist has
healed, but Greene hasn't been able to recover fully from shoulder
surgery last October.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels want to get his bat in the lineup, but he'll have to
play in the field because Tim Salmon is the DH. How Greene's
shoulder responds to making throws from the outfield _ or even at
first base _ remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Collins said when asked what he expects from
Greene. ``The reports are he's doing fine in the outfield. When he
gets up here we'll see what happens. It's a tough call because his
arm's still an issue. Can he make the play Dave (Hollins) made on
the (3-6-1) double play (Tuesday) night? I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins was asked if Greene's height (listed at 5-foot-10, but
closer to 5-8) would be a factor playing first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, but I saw (Steve) Garvey play there for a long
time,'' Collins said. ``If his hands are as good as Garvey's, he
could play there, too.
</P>
<P>
   __ Who's on first?: The Angels like Hollins at first base. They
think his hitting will improve because he won't have to worry about
his defense. Hollins led all A.L. third basemen with 27 errors last
year and has made a team-leading 17 this year. Most of his errors
are throwing errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to play, it doesn't matter where it is,'' said
Hollins, who then got sarcastic. ``Any time I don't have to throw
the ball makes my life a lot easier. I've been out of position for
25 years, since T-ball.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Hill over hill: Ken Hill (elbow) threw 45 pitches in three
innings of a simulated game and felt fine. He'll throw again on
Friday in Chicago, then go on the first of probably three starts on
a rehab assignment. The first one will be Sunday for the Angels'
Single-A affiliate in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Hill had elbow surgery on June 15 but has eight wins, the same
as Chuck Finley and only one fewer than team-leader Jason Dickson.
Hill said he's been able to remain patient and not rush himself
back too soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm anxious to get back, but when I get back I want to be
ready,'' he said. ``This is the first time I've had surgery. I
don't know what it takes in terms of rehab, so I take it as it
comes. They (doctors and trainers) have been through it more than I
have.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Streaky hitter: Troy Glaus has a six-game hitting streak, the
longest streak by an Angels rookie starting from his debut.

JEAN FAIR MITCHELL, 88, SPIRITED HEADMISTRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Scotland, Maine)   (bl)  
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jean Fair Mitchell, a violin-playing, jig-dancing
Scottish-born educator who guided the venerable Brearley School for
girls from the white-glove 1940s through the armband 1960s without
missing a beat, died Aug. 5 at Lenox Hill Hospital near her home in
Manhattan. She was 88 and had been the Brearley headmistress from
1947 to 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Brearley, or the Brearley as it tends to be known by those who
have trod its halls at 83rd Street and the East River, has been a
forward-looking New York institution since it was founded in 1884
to provide an education for the intellectually gifted daughters of
the New York elite.
</P>
<P>
   And by Miss Mitchell's time, its modern character had largely
been set by her redoubtable predecessor, Millicent Carey McIntosh,
whose departure in 1947 created the opportunity for a remarkable
academic trade, one in which Brearley sent Mrs. McIntosh to Barnard
College to become dean (and eventually president) and Barnard dealt
Miss Mitchell, a member of its English faculty, to Brearley as
headmistress.
</P>
<P>
   For all the high-spirited comment it occasioned, the swap was
largely a coincidence. After scrutinizing 75 candidates in a
five-month search for Mrs. McIntosh's successor, the Brearley
trustees announced that Miss Mitchell had been the board's first
choice.
</P>
<P>
   If her first decade or so presented few challenges in an era
that is, after all, recalled as the quiescent 1950s, Miss Mitchell,
a short, husky woman of verve who declaimed the poetry of Robert
Burns in authentic dialect and Scottish burr, wasted little time in
putting her own stamp on the school.
</P>
<P>
   Brearley had made social history by welcoming Jewish students as
early as the 1880s, but Miss Mitchell promptly advanced its
commitment to social diversity by recruiting its first black
students, an effort aided by a Rockefeller Foundation grant to
provide scholarships for needy minority students.
</P>
<P>
   She also left her mark on Brearley students. For a woman who had
such an austere public persona that girls would sometimes quake
before being sent to her office for discipline, Miss Mitchell
proved to be a pussycat in private, a warm and understanding woman
who seemed to identify with troublemakers, perhaps because as a
schoolgirl she had been one herself.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Kirkcaldy, a Scottish town known that was, she liked
to point out, known less for its heather than for a large linoleum
factory, Miss Mitchell was apparently such a hell-raiser during her
school days that when she became headmistress at Brearley, the
headmaster of her former school congratulated her as a ``poacher
turned gamekeeper.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Mitchell, who would sometimes tell horror stories about the
corporal punishment girls endured at Scottish schools, came away
with such an aversion to punishment of any kind that she became
famous at Brearley for her reluctance to suspend even the most
recalcitrant troublemakers.
</P>
<P>
   Her identification with the aspirations, frustrations and
occasional fractiousness of the young was so complete that when the
1960s brought a wave of youthful unrest and rebelliousness over the
Vietnam War, she quietly defused the anger among Brearley students,
granting upperclassmen, for example, a day off to participate in an
antiwar demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   While Brearley students were as rebellious as any teen-agers in
the 1960s, Miss Mitchell tended to be so understanding and
accommodating that she left the rabble-rousers with little to
complain about. When, for example, students decided that Brearley's
infamous blue tunic and skirt uniforms, which they had long
complained made them look like pears, were symbols of regimentation
and oppression, she allowed students to wear more or less whatever
they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Mitchell, who was credited with strengthening science and
mathematics courses, also responded positively to student
complaints that the Brearley curriculum was not relevant to modern
society. But the changes she authorized, like allowing students to
substitute Spanish for German and complete their Latin requirements
before high school, did not reach the level of some 1960s academic
silliness and left the tough core curriculum unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Mitchell, who received a master's in English from the
University of Edinburgh, trained to be a teacher, spent five years
teaching at an Edinburgh girls school, then came to the United
States in 1936 as a postgraduate fellow at Smith College. She later
joined the Smith faculty and taught at Sarah Lawrence for a year
before going to Barnard in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   For all her devotion to education, Miss Mitchell, whose father
was an engineer, came close to pursuing a music career. At the time
she was offered her first teaching post, he was also offered a job
as violinist with the Edinburgh Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   She apparently chose education over music as a career because
she knew she could always pursue her love of music on her own, as
she did at Brearley, where she would play chamber music with
students, and at her summer home (a converted one-room schoolhouse)
in Blue Hill, Maine, where she was deeply involved with the Kneisel
Hall music school.

JOHN S. THOMSON, 77, CIA ANALYST AND CANOEIST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Va., Wis.)   (bl)  
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ John Seabury Thomson, an Asia analyst for the CIA
who was better known for his avocation as an untiring proponent of
canoeing, died Aug. 3 at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Md. He was
77 and lived in Chevy Chase, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack that Thomson suffered July 29 after
canoeing on a whitewater stretch of the Potomac River, said his
brother, James.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's canoeing exploits were first noted in a 1961 article
in The New York Times about CIA employees who paddled a canoe
across the Potomac from their homes on the Maryland side to the
agency's headquarters in Langley, Va., because paddling to work was
quicker than driving.
</P>
<P>
   John Thomson was born in Nanjing, China, in 1921 to missionary
teachers sent there by the Presbyterian Board of Foreign
Ministries.
</P>
<P>
   He spent almost all of his early years in China before entering
Swarthmore College in 1939. He joined the Navy after graduation and
served as an officer on a submarine chaser along the Atlantic coast
and was then recruited into the Office of Strategic Services, the
U.S. wartime intelligence agency, to work in China. He was posted
to Xian, where he trained troops to operate behind the Japanese
lines.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Thomson received a master's degree and a
doctorate from Columbia University in political science and Far
Eastern affairs, and he taught for seven years at the University of
Wisconsin. He joined the CIA in 1957 and engaged in research,
specializing in China and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Thomson returned to China many times,
eventually becoming a tour leader who helped introduce a new
generation of Americans to the country.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 53 years, Peggy; two sons,
Christopher, of Ribera, N.M., and David, of Holyoke, Mass.; a
daughter, Hilary, of Concord, N.H.; two sisters, Nancy Waller of
Cherry Valley, N.Y., and Sydney Brown of Palo Alto, Calif.; his
brother, James, of Cambridge, Mass., and six grandchildren.

ANGELS BEATEN IN NINTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ This one, the Anaheim Angels said, was easier
to swallow. They simply were beaten.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Indians snapped a losing streak at five games
after Manny Ramirez hit a two-run home run off Angels closer Troy
Percival in the ninth inning for a 6-5 win Wednesday afternoon
before a sellout crowd of 43,104 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez's home run prevented the Angels from sweeping the series
and left them 1{ games behind Texas in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians scored three runs off Angels starter Omar Olivares
in the sixth inning to turn a 3-1 deficit into a 4-3 lead. But the
Angels got solo home runs _ Dave Hollins (No. 11) in the sixth and
Tim Salmon (No. 21) in the seventh _ to take a 5-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Relievers Greg Cadaret and Rich DeLucia held the lead until
handing over the ball to Percival in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   With one out, Jim Thome hit a high fly ball to the wall in
right. Right fielder Garret Anderson struggled to see the ball in
the afternoon glare, leaped at the fence and got a glove on it,
only to drop it as Thome raced into second with a double. Then
Ramirez, who hit two homers against the Angels on Tuesday, pounded
a 2-2 pitch from Percival (2-5) into the left-field bullpen to send
the Angels to their sixth loss on the nine-game homestand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good today,'' said Percival, who got his fourth blown
save of the season. ``What can I say? They beat me. I've said it
100 times, if they beat me, they beat me. I didn't get myself in
trouble. They swung the bats and put it out of the ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had a chance to take Percival off the hook in the
bottom of the ninth against Indians closer Mike Jackson. With two
out, Anderson reached on an error and went to third on a single by
Salmon, his third hit of the day and seventh in two games.
</P>
<P>
   Lefty Paul Assenmacher came in to face the left-handed-hitting
Jim Edmonds, who walked to load the bases for Hollins. But Hollins,
who besides his homer had a double, walk and three RBI, popped out
to end it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That puts a (expletive) damper on the whole (expletive) day,''
Hollins said.
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Terry Collins, though, wasn't so upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take the way we played; we played good today,'' he said.
``Cripes, we battled. Tim hit the homer to get the lead back. And
we had who we wanted out there in the ninth (Percival).''
</P>
<P>
   Percival has had his problems with the Indians over the years,
but it goes with the territory, Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Troy Percival will give up ninth-inning home runs because he
pitches in the ninth inning,'' Collins said. ``He said it the other
day _ he's a fastball pitcher and they're a fastball-hitting team.
You get the ball out over the middle of the plate and they're going
to hit it. And they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Shuey (4-1) got the win in relief of Indians starter
Bartolo Colon. Colon, who threw a four-hit shutout against the
Angels at Edison Field on April 4, wasn't nearly as sharp
Wednesday. The Angels took a 1-0 lead in the second after Hollins
walked, went to third on a double by Troy Glaus and scored on a
sacrifice fly by Matt Walbeck.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians tied the game in the top of the third on Kenny
Lofton's RBI double, but the Angels went up 3-1 in the bottom of
the third on Hollins' two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels missed a chance to increase their lead in the fourth
when left fielder Mark Whiten threw out Orlando Palmeiro trying to
score from second on a single by Randy Velarde. The throw was late,
but catcher Pat Borders blocked Palmeiro off the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough game,'' Salmon said. ``Both teams played hard
and wanted to win. We can't hang our heads about that. We played a
good game, they played a little bit better.''

SPORTS COLUMN: JOHN LUCAS MAKES A PITCH FOR VALUES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (mk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When John Lucas was in the business of coaching basketball and
helping troubled players become clean and sober, he liked to say
they had a ``living problem,'' not a drug problem. He preached the
virtues of achieving a level of maturity compatible with adulthood,
but his message and companion coaching tactics were eventually
muted by Rileyesque challenges to players' manhood, by the
seductive spoils of corporately fueled celebrity, by the boot-camp
obsession to win at all costs.
</P>
<P>
   With his own addictive tendencies to consider, Lucas treated his
wounds after being fired by the Philadelphia 76ers two years ago by
following one of his personal tenets. ``Surrender to win,'' he told
himself, and that is what he tells the players and the parents at
the tennis club he owns in Houston, where Lucas has settled into
the more organic lifestyle of trying to raise healthy athletes
before they reach the point of having to be saved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell the parents, `Get involved but don't get crazy,'''
Lucas said on the telephone the other day. As usual, as it was when
this former drug addict was overseeing the recovery of professional
athletes at the clinic he has since closed, the day always begins
with him mouthing those words while looking in the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas has a 15-year-old son, John Harding Lucas III, who happens
to be very good in the two sports in which his talented father lost
his way and very nearly his life. As a high school freshman, the
younger Lucas led the city in scoring on the basketball court and
also picked up a tennis racquet to play competitively for the first
time. Nineteen months later, he will participate next week in the
U.S. Tennis Association's Boys' 16 nationals in Kalamazoo, Mich.
Seeded 12th of the 13 qualifiers from Texas, John III isn't going
to win, and realizes as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' he complained to his father recently, ``I've been
playing for over a year and haven't even won a major tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   John Lucas told his son, guess what, you may never win one but
that's not why you're playing in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   This last pearl of wisdom was no suggestion not to strive, dare
or even dream. Lucas just wants his son to avoid being trapped in
the vicious cycle of ``never enough,'' by the process of athletes
not able to accept themselves for who they are. For him, as a
southpaw prodigy people once called the next Arthur Ashe, the
crippling sense of inadequacy began way back at the age of 10 and
landed him during his pro basketball career out in the street one
infamous day, shoeless, in a drug-induced stupor.
</P>
<P>
   Such dysfunction exists at all ages, many levels, and Lucas
knows how it is typically manifesting itself as television craves
live programming, as more money pours into sports, as the race to
earn these riches expands. It all turns into the scandalized
cycling event that concluded last weekend in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tour de France thing was exactly the case of it not being
enough just to be part of something, of athletes who are so
addicted to the competitive high they will risk their health to
take performance-enhancing drugs,'' Lucas said. ``And that is the
same thing as a living problem, as trying to escape the feelings of
not being good enough by snorting cocaine.''
</P>
<P>
   When sports teams invite Lucas to their training camps, as the
Detroit Lions did last week in Saginaw, Mich., they essentially
want him to tell his story and advise the players to just say no.
But he knows the culture has evolved from the street drug plague of
his playing days. He remembers hearing of a frightening poll that
asked young teen-agers if they would trade their lives at 40 by
taking performance-enhancing drugs for a gold medal at 20, and how
70 percent said, yes, in fact, they would.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole approach to drugs in sports is outdated, has to be
rewritten,'' he said, and so he began his address to the Lions last
week by asking: ``How many of you can accept the fact that you are
not and never will be Barry Sanders?''
</P>
<P>
   This sounded trite, he agreed, but then again, the simple truth
is that most pro athletes lost perspective as adolescents on why
they compete. When they lose, when they don't measure up, they cry
like John III's 9-year-old brother, Jai, did when he would lose at
tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even let him play anymore,'' Lucas said. ``If he cries
at 9, he'll really be crying at 15.''
</P>
<P>
   And what if these lost years wind up making the difference in
the boy's chances of becoming a pro?
</P>
<P>
   John Lucas sighed and said, ``He'll live.''

SHOCK! HORROR! JETS ARE THINKING PLAYOFFS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   What a difference a year makes if you play football for the New
York Jets. Here they are getting ready for their opening exhibition
game at Philadelphia on Thursday night, and they think they are
pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thinking playoffs; all of us are,'' quarterback Glenn
Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been around a while,'' added the oldest Jet, 37-year-old
punter Brian Hansen, ``and it's nice to finally think you've got a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was only 12 months ago that coach Bill Parcells led the
Jets into their preseason opener (also against the Eagles) and
before two minutes had elapsed, he wondered, ``I've got 20 of these
in a row, Parcells, how are we going to get this team better?''
</P>
<P>
   That Jets team was trying to get the sticky legacy of a 1-15
record from 1996 off their shoes. They wound up sweeping their
exhibition slate, giving Parcells a remarkable 39-14 preseason
record as a head coach with the Giants, Patriots and Jets.
</P>
<P>
   And then the Jets produced their turnaround 9-7 regular-season
record, narrowly missing the playoffs. Now Parcells, instead of
telling the players, as he did a year ago, that it was time to stop
being the worst team in the league, talks to them about being one
of the better teams. And many players feel they can be.
</P>
<P>
   Still, nobody knows exactly what kind of team these Jets will
be, particularly since there will be at least 10 different starters
from a year ago. But Thursday night, fans may find out something
about Foley, who has been elevated from sporadic starter to No. 1
quarterback, and whether the grit and swagger he has displayed in
the past will continue now that he has the added pressure of
defending his new status.
</P>
<P>
   Foley may not have his newest support player available, since
Curtis Martin suffered a hamstring injury that kept him from
running for six days. If he feels comfortable Thursday night,
though, Parcells may use him. But the Jets have an array of other
new offensive players they are testing. Wayne Chrebet is now a
full-time starter at receiver with Keyshawn Johnson. Dedric Ward,
the meteoric rookie of last summer who quickly burned out and then
came back, is attempting to be the club's third pass catcher. He is
the team's fastest player.
</P>
<P>
   Foley can also count on sure-handed receivers out of the
backfield. In addition to Martin, there is Richie Anderson and Leon
Johnson, as well as the new fullback tandem of Jerald Sowell and
Keith Byars. For now, there appears to be no clear-cut winner in
the tight end race between Kyle Brady and Fred Baxter. The major
question remaining among the starters on offense is at right tackle
_ can the rookie from Cincinnati, Jason Fabini, unseat Siupeli
Malamala?
</P>
<P>
   It appears Parcells is leaning that way. He is giving Fabini, a
fourth-round pick, every chance in practice and has him rotating
with the first unit. And this much is certain about the revamped
line: It is immeasurably stronger up the middle with Kevin Mawae at
center. Last year's combination of Roger Duffy at the position,
with the deliberate Neil O'Donnell at quarterback, created a
dangerous combination. O'Donnell was sacked once for every 10
passing attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' defense will have Dwayne Gordon at middle linebacker
in place of Marvin Jones, whose season was ended by a training-camp
knee injury last Friday. But Bill Belichick, the assistant head
coach and defensive mastermind, has confidence in a revised front
four that includes the free-agent pickup Anthony Pleasant at right
end. Perhaps the Jets will test some new pass-rushing schemes
against the Eagles. If Pleasant can get to the quarterback, as he
did for Belichick in their days in Cleveland, the Jets will not
have to rush a linebacker quite so often.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another issue for the front four is whether there will be
continued improvement from left tackle Jason Ferguson, who was only
a rookie last year. This season's top draft choice, defensive end
Dorian Boose from Washington State, has only been mediocre in camp.
Now he will be scrutinized in a game, as will the team's second
pick, safety Scott Frost out of Nebraska, where he was the starting
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Eagles, they are led by third-year quarterback Bobby
Hoying, who does not have Ricky Watters at running back any longer.
Watters signed with Seattle. The Jets will, however, face Hugh
Douglas, who is now the Eagles' left defensive end following his
failure to adjust to the Jets' 3-4 defense last year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   With the addition of Bryan Cox, the Jets now have seven players
who have gone to the Pro Bowl. But of all of them, only cornerback
Aaron Glenn has made it as a Jet.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: WHAT CAUSED THE MARKET'S SUMMER SWOON? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you own stocks, taking a summer vacation may be a bad idea.
You might return a lot poorer.
</P>
<P>
   It was less than three weeks ago, on July 17, that the big stock
indexes hit new records amid general celebration that the U.S.
economy was performing ever so wonderfully, whatever might happen
to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But by late Wednesday afternoon, the Dow Jones industrial
average and the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks had lost 10
percent of their peak value, although there had been no epochal
event that would seem likely to cause such a fall.
</P>
<P>
   At least for now, that plunge has been halted. Just before 3:30
p.m. Wednesday, a flood of buy orders hit the New York Stock
Exchange, many of them to be executed at the close of trading. It
looked as if a big mutual fund _ perhaps an index fund that buys
all the stocks in the S&AMP;P 500 _ had committed a lot of money to
stocks. Whoever did it, the move lifted prices, and spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the question remains: What set this off? There is no
shortage of explanations from the seers. They point to worries
about Asia, to weakening corporate profits, and even to Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Some see disappointment over Senate resistance to further cuts
in capital gains taxes, or over testimony by Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan, who seems unwilling to lower interest
rates despite signs of a slowing economy.
</P>
<P>
   There is a case to be made for all of those things having
negative implications for share prices, but there could be a
simpler explanation. Maybe American investors are running a little
low on money to pour into the stock market. The most notable factor
in the recent growth of the U.S. economy has been the strong
purchasing by American consumers. All that buying of goods may have
left less cash available for stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the great bull market of the 1990s was looking a bit
shaky even before the current plunge. Big stocks recovered from a
sag that began in the spring, but little ones did not. The Russell
2000 _ the best index of small stocks _ is down 19 percent from its
April peak. The stocks that were moving were the big blue chips,
which have risen to unprecedented valuations, and some Internet
stocks that produced rampant speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding the recent turmoil, there is no sign that
Americans have lost their faith in stocks. Aging baby boomers still
see stocks as the best place for their retirement money. It is
unlikely that will change unless stock prices fall much further _
and over a much longer time period _ than they have so far. With
long-term Treasury bonds yielding less than 5.7 percent,
alternative investments do not look attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Abby Joseph Cohen, the Goldman, Sachs strategist who has been
bullish _ and right _ since 1991, reassured her followers Wednesday
by saying that profits were better than they seemed while the worst
impact of Asian problems was behind us. You can get an argument on
either point, but a wholesale flight from American stocks seems
unlikely until the arguments are decided. It would probably take an
American recession.
</P>
<P>
   There is a wild card here, however. Never before has the
American economy been so dependent on the stock market. Some
economists say that a large part of recent growth in consumer
demand has reflected the feeling of wealth brought on by higher
stock prices. A bear market, if one comes, would damage the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The nice circle _ with the economy and the stock market pushing
each other higher _ will not last forever.

PIAZZA AND METS PUT TALKS ON HOLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Since Mike Piazza was acquired by the New York Mets
on May 22, he has been asked over and over if he would re-sign when
his contract expires at the end of the season. And the longer he
has gone without re-signing, the louder the questions have grown,
as have the criticism and catcalls. Wednesday, the Mets and Piazza
moved to put a stop to it, but they also may have increased the
possibility that he will walk away as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza became visibly irritated at a report that appeared in
Tuesday's editions of The Record of Hackensack, N.J., and then
online at ESPN Sportszone, also on Tuesday, quoting anonymous
sources that asserted that Piazza had already decided that he would
not return to the Mets. And after Piazza delivered a scathing
denial of the stories, the Mets announced that the two sides would
not engage in any negotiations until after the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   While Mets general manager Steve Phillips fielded the questions
before Wednesday night's game, it still was unclear whether this
move proved the rumors to be true or if, as Phillips said, it was
only done to allow the all-star catcher to focus on playing
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we decided to do was publicly state what our plans are in
regard to Mike's contract negotiations,'' Phillips said. ``After
some discussion we've decided to put off any further discussions or
negotiations until the end of the season, so that at this stage
Mike can kind of focus on playing ball, the team can focus on
baseball and the contract doesn't get in the way of what we're
trying to do as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is mutually agreed upon. We talked about it and I think
from both sides' perspective, because there didn't seem to be a
quick resolution to the negotiations, that we thought it would be
better to get back to the focus on baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets have now taken away at least two months in which
they would have been the only team able to negotiate with Piazza.
Now, when the postseason ends, there will be a two-week window of
exclusivity before free agents may declare their intentions. While
Phillips said that he hopes to be able to resume talks during that
time, it is believed that Piazza will place himself on the open
market.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza reportedly turned down a six-year deal worth $84 million
with the Los Angeles Dodgers, seeking a seven-year, $100 million
contract, which prompted the Dodgers to deal him to the Florida
Marlins. The Mets then sent three highly regarded prospects _
Preston Wilson, Ed Yarnall and Geoff Goetz _ to the Marlins to
acquire Piazza. What seemed like a small price for Piazza at the
time could turn out to be a huge cost if he leaves and the Mets get
nothing in return. This move also comes shortly after Phillips
assured Piazza's agent, Dan Lozano, that Piazza would not be traded
before the July 31 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still hope and expect that at the end of the season we'll
be able to sign him,'' Phillips said. ``There is some period of
exclusivity that we have to negotiate when the season ends before
the free agent declaration period and we hope to revisit the issues
at that point before he goes on the open market and we'll wait and
see how it all unfolds at that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a window of exclusivity, but clearly you assume
some risk when you put time off and don't get contracts done and
allow even the potential for a player to move out on the open
market,'' he added. ``They didn't say no. Let's put it this way,
they certainly have the prerogative to say, `No.' At this point
we'd rather wait for the open period.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza stressed repeatedly that he does not want to worry about
the contract now, but will concentrate on trying to get his game on
track and help the Mets reach the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the big debate is,'' Piazza said before
Wednesday night's game, which he sat out with an afternoon game on
the schedule for Thursday. ``It shouldn't be an issue. The issue
should be the baseball team and that's it. I've probably said it 10
times before and it's the last time I'll mention my personal
situation. Everything else is secondary to my job, which is to help
the Mets get into the playoffs and that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza was clearly angered by the reports. While he said that he
does not go on the Internet, he was told about the story and he was
shaken by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like The National Enquirer,'' Piazza said. ``It's a joke.
It's just ridiculous. It's a joke to even be talking about it.
There are so many rumors on there and it's all inaccurate. You
might as well read The Weekly World News.''

BARGAINING WILL BEGIN ON DAY 37 OF NBA DISPUTE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With some players already missing paychecks,
negotiators for the National Basketball Association and its union
will meet Thursday in their first bargaining session of the
league's 37-day-old lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing significant can be expected to develop at the meeting,
but the two sides have to start somewhere in their effort to reach
an agreement before the scheduled start of the season becomes
jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
   The bargaining session is expected to draw half a dozen or so
owners and a dozen or so players.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators will most likely spend most of their time
reviewing their respective bargaining positions and where they
stand. That exchange shouldn't take long, but the union gave the
league an ancillary issue to ponder Wednesday, announcing that an
overwhelming majority of players in the NBA women's league have
agreed to form a union and have the National Basketball Players
Association as their collective bargaining representative.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the announcement was most likely not coincidental.
The development will have no bearing on the lockout talks, but it
serves to remind Commissioner David Stern that the union is a force
to be reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   The union had won two rounds of a dispute over the right of the
arbitrator, John Feerick, to hear a union grievance over the rights
of players with guaranteed contracts to receive their pay in spite
of the lockout. First, a federal judge refused an NBA request to
remove Feerick as arbitrator on the grounds that his term expired
along with the labor agreement on June 30. Then Feerick, dean of
Fordham Law School, ruled that he had jurisdiction to hear the
case. He is expected to schedule a hearing for late next week,
although the league wants a delay until next month.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute that led to the June 22 lockout, during which all
league business is suspended, centers on economic issues, primarily
the owners' desire to spend less of their revenue on player
salaries. The league says 1997-98 salaries consumed 57 percent of
revenues and has proposed a 50 percent ceiling on such expenditures
to be phased in over two or three years.
</P>
<P>
   The league also wants to phase out the salary cap exception,
which allows a team to exceed the cap in signing its own free-agent
player. The players ardently want to retain the exception.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   About 220 of the league's 410 players have guaranteed contracts;
30 have contracts that call for them to receive money before the
season. Kenny Anderson, for example, has a contract that stipulates
he will be paid his entire $5.84 million salary on July 1. He has
not received the money.
</P>
<P>
   The shorter list also includes John Stockton, Hakeem Olajuwon,
Tim Duncan, Juwan Howard and Shaquille O'Neal, who is scheduled to
receive a $15 million payment Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The union, meanwhile, said it plans to establish a separate
organization to represent the Women's National Basketball
Association players. Billy Hunter, the union's executive director,
said he had received signed union cards from nearly 100 of the
league's 120 players since the union began an organizing drive four
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It presents us with a clear mandate,'' Hunter said in a
statement, ``to begin negotiating with the WNBA on behalf of these
players, and we are delighted to have the opportunity to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Those negotiations, though, are not very likely to begin soon.
The league can delay the creation of the women's union by
exercising its right to request an election among the players
conducted by the National Labor Relations Board. An election would
probably not be held until next spring because the WNBA season ends
in two weeks, and many of the players will then go to Europe to
play.  &QL;

   When they grew grass over the artificial turf last year at
Giants Stadium, a mysterious fungus seeped onto the artificial
field and ultimately destroyed it.
</P>
<P>
   This year, on a grass field grown over a new, million-dollar
replacement artificial turf, the Giants and Jets have looked
forward to playing three exhibition games _ a grand experiment that
could lead to both teams eventually playing on a permanent grass
field.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast. The multipurpose-field blues have struck again at
Giants Stadium. The fake grass on the stadium floor is fine. This
time, it's the real grass that's hurting.
</P>
<P>
   A concert held at the stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., over the
weekend turned large swaths of the grass _ which is suspended over
the artificial turf on 6,100 portable trays _ a sickly yellow.
Giants president John Mara said he observed other damage: brown
tire track imprints caused by forklifts that were used to set up
the concert stage.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of Saturday's first Giants preseason game at Giants
Stadium, workmen prepared to paint the usual gridiron stripes and
hash marks as they simultaneously labored to mask five wide, yellow
stripes crisscrossing the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say the field doesn't look very good right now,''
Mara said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Clark, whose company installed and maintains the grass
field, said, ``It got trashed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What more bad luck can you have there?'' Clark said with a
laugh. ``If something can go wrong, it has.''
</P>
<P>
   But the stadium's general manager, Tim Hassett, had a different
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a surprise to anybody here,'' he said. ``The reason
nobody has gone to grass in Giants Stadium is because there's been
no system that anyone believed could withstand the level of stress
our field has to go through.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an experiment and Scott Clark feels he can make it work.
I think it's going fine so far. Everyone can say the field looks
lousy now, but wait until Saturday. Wait until the exhibition
football games and the two or three soccer games have been played.
We'll judge how this works out in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   First, of course, there's the marching band competition Thursday
night at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The current grass field was installed to allow the MetroStars of
Major League Soccer to play their games on grass. It will be
removed before the Giants' and Jets' regular seasons begin, and was
supposed to be dismantled before the pro football exhibition
season.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Giants practiced on the grass field in the stadium
this spring, players, coaches and the team's management were eager
to try playing a few exhibition games on the field as an
experiment.
</P>
<P>
   There were no complications to this arrangement until Sunday's
Budweiser Superfest concert, a performance of several musical acts
headlined by the singer Patti LaBelle. The concert was attended by
7,000 people. But it was the stage assembly and its dismantling
that harmed the grass.
</P>
<P>
   Plywood was placed across the grass to create wooden roads so
that 5,000-pound forklifts could carry pieces of the steel stage
from trucks in the surrounding parking lots to the middle of the
field. The plywood remained on the grass for eight to 10 hours a
day from Thursday until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you covered parts of your lawn with plywood for even a day,
it would turn a different color,'' Hassett said. ``There's no way
to prevent that. The field wasn't trashed, and they placed the
plywood right where they were told to place it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clark suggested that if there were ever a permanent grass field
inside Giants Stadium, certain kinds of concerts would not be
scheduled near the football season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You live and learn,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Clark hopes to make the field acceptable by
Saturday and for the other games at the stadium this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can turn the field from very bad to acceptable _ and
host a marching band competition in the midst of all that,'' Clark
said, ``it'll show some ability to make this work. This is the
worst-case scenario and we're probably going to make it, so it
looks OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it certainly isn't going to be as good as it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Mara said: ``I think we're all hoping the field holds up, but
this is precisely the type of thing that we have to do if we're
going to know if grass will work in Giants Stadium. Are they going
to be able to maintain the field given the number of events the
facility hosts?''
</P>
<P>
   Clark and Mara said it was premature to speculate that Giants
Stadium would have a permanent grass field by next year or even the
year after, regardless of how the current trial period plays out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day is coming for that,'' Clark said. ``But we won't do it
until we know it will work. This is another first step. The real
proof will be the Giants-Jets exhibition game Aug. 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``How will the field look then _ after this concert, after three
football games, three soccer games and a marching band competition?
That's when we'll know.''
</P>
<P>
   Mara made a final, especially appropriate point given the recent
history of the Giants Stadium playing surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can develop a field that will work in Giants Stadium,''
he said, ``then people will know it can work anywhere.''

METS LOSE TO GIANTS, 6-4 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Tuesday afternoon, Bobby Valentine wondered aloud
why New York fans had not yet got excited over the wild-card race
that the Mets were squarely in the middle of. Wednesday night, at
least, the blame fell on his own team's shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   While a postgame concert might have had more to do with keeping
the fans in their seats than the uninspired play of the Mets, the
fans cheered to the end, getting excited over the slightest
semblance of a rally. But that was all they got as the Mets lost,
6-4, to the San Francisco Giants, another team in the thick of the
wild-card hunt.
</P>
<P>
   On a night when the Mets pulled off their first triple-play in
nine years, the Giants pounded Bobby Jones, while Russ Ortiz shut
the Mets down over eight innings for his first major league
victory. And off the field, the day was filled with more skepticism
concerning the chances of keeping Mike Piazza at Shea Stadium after
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza drew cheers with a pinch-hit single in the bottom of the
ninth that kept alive a threat. But his hopes of putting aside his
contract negotiations to attend to the team's playoff push were
wasted after Lenny Harris, who had walked to drive in the winning
run the night before, stranded the tying runs when he struck out on
a checked swing against Giants closer Rob Nen to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had a chance to move ahead of the Giants in the
wild-card race and to within two games of the Chicago Cubs, who
lost earlier in the day to the Arizona Diamondbacks. But the loss
kept the Mets three behind the Cubs and pushed them a game and a
half behind the Giants, with 51 to play.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight night, the Mets' starting pitching
failed, with Jones (7-7) being roughed up as badly as any of the
relievers have been this season. Jones surrendered 12 hits and six
runs before being lifted after facing two batters in the sixth
inning. While Jones has won only once in 10 starts since June 11,
this was his worst performance of that span, matching season worsts
for hits and runs allowed.
</P>
<P>
   With Piazza, Todd Hundley and Edgardo Alfonzo getting breathers,
the Mets still were able to provide leads of 2-0 and 3-2 for Jones,
but he held no lead for even a half-inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets scored twice in the third on a two-run double by John
Olerud, but Jones gave both runs back in the top of the fourth. Rey
Ordonez then drove a two-out, run-scoring double to the warning
track in center field in the bottom of the fourth, but Jones was
tagged for two runs in the top of the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   That inning could have been worse for the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants were threatening to put the game out of reach, having
strung four consecutive hits and scored their third and fourth
runs, when J.T. Snow went to the plate with Barry Bonds on third
and Jeff Kent on first. Snow ripped a hard grounder to first and
Olerud fielded the ball and fired it to Ordonez to force Kent at
second.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez sneaked a peek at Bonds on third and then, as he relayed
the ball to first to get Snow, Bonds took off for home. Olerud
double-clutched briefly after pulling the ball out of his glove,
but threw a perfect strike home and Todd Pratt was able to block
Bonds' left foot as he slid in, putting the tag on him for the
eighth triple play in Mets history.
</P>
<P>
   That only provided Jones with a brief reprieve, as the Giants
continued to pound him in the sixth inning. Rey Sanchez led off
with a double down the left-field line and Doug Mirabelli, the No.
8 hitter in the lineup, drilled a double off the right-field wall,
giving the Giants a 5-3 lead and sending Jones to the showers.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Blair came on and after he retired one batter, Marvin
Benard ripped a single to right, scoring Mirabelli with the Giants'
sixth run.

ANGELS DUMP FIELDER, WILL GO WITH SPEED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ After he finished talking with reporters,
Cecil Fielder put on his 1996 World Series ring, lit a cigar and
headed for the door.
</P>
<P>
   Fielder was designated for assignment by the Anaheim Angels on
Wednesday, meaning the club has 10 days to either trade him or
release him. If the Angels can't trade him, they'll be responsible
for paying Fielder what's left on his $2.8 million salary _ about
$900,000 _ unless another team signs him.
</P>
<P>
   Fielder said he isn't planning to retire _ ``I've still got the
fire in me to play'' _ and there are a couple of teams interested
in him, including the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a disappointing day,'' said Fielder, who hit
.241 with 17 homers and a team-best 68 RBI (tied with Darin Erstad)
in 103 games. ``I feel I could still help this club win. The most
frustrating part is that this team is biting at the bit for first
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a bitter person, I'm just down about it. I've worked
with these guys since spring training. I've made new friendships.
I've gone through the highs and lows with these guys. It's
something I want to be a part of.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' decision to move Fielder off the roster was made
because the club needed to create a spot for Todd Greene. Greene
has been recovering from offseason shoulder surgery and has been
playing at Triple-A Vancouver. He'll join the team Friday in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last few days, obviously we made big changes in our
lineup at third and first,'' said Angels general manager Bill
Bavasi. ``We're not set up to platoon at a lot of positions. Coming
off the bench would be a better role for Todd. At this point, we
owe it to Cecil to put him in a position to play every day. He's
not real effective playing sporadically.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent promotion of third baseman Troy Glaus moved Dave
Hollins into competition with Fielder at first. The Angels decided
they liked the look of their lineup better with Hollins at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I told Cecil, the one thing we got him for ... we just
didn't feel we were getting the production we needed from him,''
Angels manager Terry Collins said. ``We weren't scoring runs, so we
decided to go with a lineup with more speed to create some runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Two early injuries helped lead to the move. Tim Salmon moved
from right field to DH in April because of a foot injury and
Greene's bad shoulder prevented him from catching. That limited
Collins' options for Fielder to first base.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Fielder's Angels teammates expressed surprise and
disappointment at the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all going to miss Cece,'' pitcher Chuck Finley said.
``It's always disappointing to have a team player and something
happens to him. He'll help somebody.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what you get veteran players for _ leadership,
camaraderie in the clubhouse. The guy's been playing a long time,
he's the cream of the crop. He's played for three or four teams,
played in Japan. He loves the game, you can see that. We're going
to miss him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad to see,'' Salmon said. ``He's a veteran that
everybody in the clubhouse respects. You can't help but admire the
guy. You hate to see a guy like that go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a professional, I'm able to handle things,'' Fielder said.
``I understand that sometimes things don't work out. I tried the
best I could.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to bring in people they feel will help the club
down the stretch. That's the only way I can look at it. I can't
fault the organization for feeling that way. I'll kick back for a
couple days and see what happens. I've got to get my family home
safe (to Florida). That's the most important thing right now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A move like this is never easy,'' Bavasi said. ``To move
someone off the club, it's especially hard to do when you're
talking about a player like Cecil Fielder, who's in the midst of a
great career.''

ABC AND ESPN IN BIG BID FOR NHL TV RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite falling ratings for National Hockey League telecasts,
ABC and ESPN have mounted a combined $600 million bid for broadcast
and cable television rights for five years to start in 1999, said
executives involved in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   At $120 million a year, the bid would represent a stunning 167
percent leap over the average annual rights payment that Fox ($31
million) and ESPN (about $14 million) have been paying. The offer
would also double what Fox and ESPN are to pay in the coming
season, the last year of their deals.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox only has to match the ABC offer by Aug. 14 to retain its
rights. The ABC part of the deal is about $250 million, the
executives said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been informed of the ABC and ESPN bid and we're
examining our options,'' said Vince Wladika, a Fox spokesman. The
cable portion, which is an estimated $350 million, is greater than
ABC's because ESPN and ESPN2 would carry more games. ESPN has been
showing one game a week and ESPN2 has shown three. Fox could
counter with a dual bid, adding FX or the Fox Sports Net as its
cable component. Fox and FX currently carry major league baseball
nationally. But low ratings and the size of the ABC-ESPN bid make
matching unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hockey has good demographics, a high proportion of young males
watching and growth projected because of the roller blading side of
the game,'' said Neal Pilson, a sports television industry
consultant. ``But if these numbers are true, I'm hard pressed to
come up with a rationale based on television economics.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC and ESPN, which are subsidiaries of Walt Disney Co., made no
comment on their joint bid. Their talks, which were held at the NHL
meetings in Nashville, Tenn., were first reported Wednesday in The
Wall Street Journal. The ABC-ESPN bid is the newest evidence of
escalating sports rights costs. In January, ABC, ESPN, Fox and CBS
agreed to eight-year deals worth $17.6 billion to carry the
National Football League games.
</P>
<P>
   Now, ESPN and ABC are heavily cross-promoting full seasons of
Sunday night and Monday night games. In mounting its hockey bid,
Disney is trying to protect important programming for ESPN and
ESPN2 from an incursion by Fox, and to create a broadcast position,
with ABC, from which hockey can be heavily cross-promoted.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's NHL ties also include ownership of the Anaheim Mighty
Ducks. Disney is also looking to a hoped-for uptick in national
hockey interest because of in-line skating and the addition of
teams in Nashville this season, Atlanta in the 1999-2000 season and
Columbus, Ohio, and St. Paul, Minn., the season after.
</P>
<P>
   But even with Fox as hockey's broadcaster, ratings struggled.
Fox's regular-season Nielsen rating fell 33 percent to a 1.4 from a
2.1 peak two years ago. And with teams from markets like New York,
Philadelphia and Chicago faltering in the playoffs, Fox's
postseason rating dropped from a 2.1 last season to a 1.8 this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed by the ratings skid, Fox pared its 1998-99
regular-season schedule from an average of six regional games a
week to three, over 11 weeks. ESPN's rating last season fell to a
0.7 from a 0.8 in 1996-97, while ESPN2's 0.4 rating was unchanged
from last year.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding ESPN's bid, Mike Soltys, a spokesman, said, ``Our
extension is not finalized.'' He would not address the ABC bid.
</P>
<P>
   ABC has carried the NHL, in an arrangement with ESPN in 1993 and
1994 that required no rights fee. ABC posted a 1.7 rating in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Fox replaced ABC, paying $155 million over five years.

WITH MILLER`S SEASON OVER, GIANTS NAME BUCKLEY THE STARTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Leaving the practice field Wednesday, the New
York Giants' newest starting player, Marcus Buckley, passed through
a throng of fans seeking autographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaun!'' one fan called to Buckley. ``Can I have your
autograph?''
</P>
<P>
   And soon there were more voices _ ``Shaun! Shaun!'' _ all of
them calling out to Buckley.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley, who will replace the injured Corey Miller as the team's
strongside linebacker, was being mistaken for rookie Shaun
Williams, a safety who is an inch shorter and about 30 pounds
lighter. Since some people have wondered whether Buckley, who is 6
feet 3 inches and 242 pounds, has the bulk it takes to play the
strongside linebacker's position, Buckley saw humor in the
misidentification.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not that small, am I?'' he said to the fans, who
nonetheless continued to call him Shaun.
</P>
<P>
   On a veteran defense that returned each of its 11 starters,
Buckley is the new guy, even if he has been with the team since
1993. And Buckley, at least in the early part of the season, will
likely be the target of opposing offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Six years a Giant and 27 years old, Marcus Buckley will finally
get the chance to make a name for himself. On a stout Giants
defense, he is the closest thing to a question mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they test me, they test me,'' Buckley said after Wednesday
morning's practice. ``I feel like I was well on my way to earning
the starting job. It took six years; I'm going to be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition between Miller and Buckley officially ended
Wednesday when the team announced that Miller's season was over.
Privately, Miller continued to indicate that he was planning to
retire. Miller, a starter for the Giants since 1992, learned on
Monday that he has a herniated disk in his neck, and team doctors
have cautioned him against playing with the injury.
</P>
<P>
   Surgery and six months of rehabilitation is still an option, but
tellingly, Miller has already begun to look into a broadcasting
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not 23 years old, I'm not Ike Hilliard,'' said Miller, who
will be 30 in October. He was referring to the Giants wide receiver
who had neck surgery last year.
</P>
<P>
   Giants defensive players and his coaches said Wednesday that
Buckley may have forced his way past Miller into the starting
lineup this season anyway. Buckley was named the starting
strongside linebacker in 1995, but did not hold the job when the
staff under former coach Dan Reeves decided that Buckley was often
effectively blocked by the opposition's tight end.
</P>
<P>
   It was those 1995 performances by Buckley that have some people
skeptical of his ability as the strongside linebacker, a player who
most often lines up across from the opposing tight end. Miller, who
is a muscular 252 pounds, seemed more at home there. But Miller's
pass coverage was not valued, while Buckley's pass coverage is
considered one of his strengths.
</P>
<P>
   As the Giants' middle linebacker, Corey Widmer, said Wednesday,
``Marcus is a little lighter in the pants than some strongside
linebackers, but he makes up for it with quickness.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' defensive coordinator, John Fox, said the team may
devise defensive schemes that provide extra support for Buckley in
obvious run situations. What the Giants do not have any longer is
depth at strongside linebacker. Buckley's backup is second-year
player Ryan Phillips, a converted defensive end who is still
learning the position.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Keith Hamilton strained a hamstring muscle
during Wednesday's afternoon workout. The rookie wide receiver Joe
Jurevicius returned to practice after being hospitalized one night
for flu-like symptoms. Safety Sam Garnes has a strained right
shoulder and did not practice. The rookie tight end Todd Pollack,
who was drafted to become the team's long snapper, sustained his
second injury of training camp _ a strained medial collateral knee
ligament. Pollack missed several days earlier with a hamstring
pull. &QL;

DISNEY MAY TAKE SHOT AT HOCKEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The Walt Disney Co., underscoring the soaring
value of TV sports programs, reportedly is bidding between $400
million and $600 million for five years of U.S. broadcast rights to
the National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   If News Corp.'s Fox doesn't top the bid, Disney would pay double
the current rate to broadcast games on its ABC and ESPN networks
between 1999 and 2004. Fox will pay $45 million for national
broadcasts during 1998-99 while ESPN will pay $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts endorsed Disney's move even though hockey ratings have
declined or been flat in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is that with a proliferation of TV channels, how do
you create an identity to separate yourselves?'' said marketing
consultant Dean Bonham. ``Sports is far and away the most
attractive way to either create, or in ESPN's case, maintain a
marketing tool.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst John Mansell of Paul Kagan Associates said ratings have
been unimpressive due to the massive increase in competing sports
programming in recent years. NHL ratings should rise, he said,
because of the addition of four new franchises over the next three
years and young viewers pulled in by the growth of in-line skating.
</P>
<P>
   Fox and Disney had no comment on attributed reports of the
offer. The NHL has an Aug. 14 deadline for offers, but marketing
consultant David Carter believes Disney's offer might represent a
pre-emptive strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Fox needs to make a counteroffer, since losing
the NHL is not a significant loss in terms of their credibility as
a network,'' Carter said. ``Owning the NFL rights during the last
four years is what legitimatized Fox.''

   Analysts said the most likely scenario will be for Disney to
focus on its national networks, and Fox on its 22 regional sports
networks. Disney pulled the plug last month on plans for a regional
network, ESPN West, and agreed to a 10-year deal for its Mighty
Ducks hockey team and Anaheim Angels baseball team to be carried on
the Fox Sports West networks.

<P>
   ``What's happening is that (Disney Chairman) Michael Eisner is
picking his spots carefully,'' Bonham said. ``I don't think Disney
has to be overly concerned about a $400 million commitment.''

   NEW YORK _ ``I slept there,'' Lee Stringer said recently,
gesturing toward the space beneath a stairwell on Track 109 at
Grand Central Terminal. ``And down there.'' Lying flat on his
stomach and leaning over the edge, he peered down. His head nearly
grazed the wheels of an idled Metro-North passenger car.
``Inside,'' he said, ``where the electrical wires are, and the
ventilation ducts and the water pipes.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in there, a decade ago, that Stringer began his journey
from homelessness and crack addiction to unlikely literary success.
</P>
<P>
   Bored and out of crack, he pulled out a stick he used for
scraping resin from his pipe and inspected it for traces of the
drug. He realized something: the tool was actually a pencil. ``I
mean, it's got lead in it and all,'' he later wrote. ``And you can
write with the thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Pulling out an old composition book, he gave it a try. ``I'm
scribbling like a maniac, heart pumping, adrenaline rushing, hands
trembling,'' he wrote. And reading the story over, he realized
something else: ``I may be a crackhead, but I can write.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Stringer is the well-reviewed author of ``Grand Central
Winter,'' a memoir of those years of homelessness. Which is how
this former crackhead came to be guiding a reporter through what is
left of an underworld in the newly spiffed-up Grand Central.
Striding as jauntily as an alumnus touring his old college campus,
he pointed out his hideaways and reminisced about his former life
and how his writing had rescued him from it.
</P>
<P>
   After the tour, he sat down for lunch in Grand Central's Oyster
Bar _ adjacent to, but a world away from, his old life. Since his
book's publication last month by Seven Stories Press, his life has
changed in ways that would have once seemed unimaginable.
</P>
<P>
   There has been lavish praise from reviewers and from the likes
of Kurt Vonnegut, who declared Stringer ``the new Jack London''
after reading the manuscript. In the foreword that he ultimately
wrote, Vonnegut described Stringer as ``a self-educated storyteller
of the first rank.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been weeks spent promoting the memoir on television
and radio on both coasts. People who might have flipped him a
quarter now listen intently to him. ``I tell them my odyssey of
what it's like to be on the street,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And there was the book party given by his publisher earlier this
summer, with catered food and 150 guests who gathered at one point
to applaud him. ``The first big event I wasn't medicated for,'' he
called it.
</P>
<P>
   At first, he says, he was grateful for any attention. Now, he is
gaining confidence and becoming exasperated by interviewers who
have not read his book or who treat him like a curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a real writer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grand Central Winter'' is the 48-year-old Stringer's chronicle
of his 10 years spent migrating from street to park to terminal _
the makeshift beds, the can collecting and crack smoking, the weeks
in a prisonlike city shelter, and the encounters with police, with
other addicts and with Geraldo Rivera for a televised interview
with the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   By his own account, at least, he was a fairly successful
strategist of homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had tons of blankets and old clothes and candles,'' he
recalled over lunch. There were also piles of paperbacks left by
commuters. ``Mostly Clancy and Grisham, popular stuff,'' he said,
``but I found Ibsen and Tennessee Williams, too.'' Another homeless
man, in a nearby cubbyhole, was a regular visitor, he said. ``He'd
come and borrow my books, like a neighbor,'' Stringer said. ``He'd
say, `Books are my TV.'''
</P>
<P>
   Each day, he would collect cans, part of a routine as
predictable as any commuter's. ``I'd go up and down the empty cars,
collecting,'' he said. ``After a while, the cleaning guy gave me
the key. I called it the franchise. I'd make somewhere between 40
and 70 bucks a day.''
</P>
<P>
   He would then cart the cans to a grocery in Queens or Chinatown.
The cash bought a day's supply of crack, which he smoked piece by
piece while prowling the streets. By early morning, when the crack
and the high were gone, he would return to Grand Central, jump down
on the tracks and squeeze through the little metal door into his
cubbyhole to sleep until afternoon. ``Then up again,'' he said
cheerily, ``in pursuit of a buzz.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the squalor, Stringer writes of himself and his
experiences with a bit of distance, a sardonic edge, as if he had
lived this way in order to write about it. His writing is edgy and
pointed and sometimes startlingly funny.
</P>
<P>
   He became homeless in 1985, after a year in which his younger
brother died _ probably of AIDS, he said. A drinking buddy offered
him a rock of crack cocaine to smoke. This, he wrote, is what he
felt: ``Success, love, orgasm, omnipotence, immortality and winning
the lottery all at once.''
</P>
<P>
   But after a couple of minutes, he said, he crashed. ``It's like
death,'' he said. After months of chasing the high, he lost his job
designing logos and writing advertising copy for a small marketing
company, quit paying rent on his Upper East Side studio and was
evicted. Unexpectedly, he felt liberated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on the street,'' he wrote in his memoir, ``clutching a
voucher for all that remains of my worldly possessions. Only
instead of feeling put out, I feel strangely relieved. Elated even.
I have just been released, I realize, from all earthly claims upon
me. There is nothing, anymore, that I am obliged to do. No one,
anymore, I am required to be.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he says, he was always confused about who he was. Growing
up in Mamaroneck, N.Y., he says, he felt out of place _ poor, on
welfare and black in overwhelmingly white, well-to-do Westchester
County. Though obviously bright, he was an erratic student and
could not afford college. After taking a course in camera operating
at a trade school, he was hired, and rapidly fired _ partly because
of the market, and partly because of his temper _ from television
stations in Detroit and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In New York, he found work writing copy and and doing graphic
design. The high point was his ad in Women's Wear Daily for bra
cups: ``This summer throw that bra away.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was not yet ready to write anything substantial, from the
heart, he said. ``It's corny, but I didn't have a writer's soul
back then,'' he said. ``I was disconnected from myself for years
and from other people. I was in search of something to write
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Homelessness and addiction gave him that. ``He found his
subject,'' said Daniel Simon, his publisher. ``Drab and miserable
as it was, for him it was fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Being homeless made him an invisible observer, Stringer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see only a phenomenon to which they have already
adjusted,'' he wrote in ``Grand Central Winter,'' referring to the
commuters who streamed by him each day. ``I make no deeper
impression on their consciousness than the taxicabs, endlessly
cruising outside, do on the pedestrians.''
</P>
<P>
   What he needed was a forum, which he found in The Street News,
the weekly tabloid created in the early 1980s. While it was
intended to be a voice for homeless people and causes, its main
purpose was as a source of income for homeless people, who sold it
on the street and in subways. Stringer's writing began appearing
frequently in The Street News, and eventually he was writing most
of its copy. Former editor Janet Allon remembers him as ``a
crackhead with a conscience, at times brilliant and at times
totally unreliable and infuriating.''
</P>
<P>
   His chance for redemption came in 1994 when a subway train
carrying his future publisher stalled. Stuck between stops, Simon
of Seven Stories Press read a copy of The Street News cover to
cover. After he got outside, he called Ms. Allon and praised
Stringer's writing, especially his columns, ``Tales from the
Rails'' and ``Ask Homey.'' Almost immediately, Stringer called back
to ask for a book contract. ``I was thinking, `Money for crack,'''
Stringer said. ``And there was a lot of ego.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon, however, agreed without hesitation. ``Lee,'' he said,
``is a real writer. I knew he would have some difficulty completing
it. But I didn't know how much difficulty.''
</P>
<P>
   After spending a $3,000 advance on crack, Stringer realized that
he could not write seriously while taking drugs. ``I didn't want to
do this anymore,'' he said. ``But I didn't know how not to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He entered a drug treatment program, which took him 18 months to
complete. After that, he was able to get on with his writing.
``Writing was mine,'' he said. ``It was the first thing I could do
on my own. It gave me back my humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   It has also given him a fresh and vastly improved future _ one
that lets him plan his new book instead of his next buzz. Seven
Stories Press has given him an advance large enough to live on for
a year or two, he said. He would not reveal the amount. ``It's a
nice deal, very affirming,'' he said. ``But I won't be buying a
Lexus.'' He also works as a teacher's aide in Mamaroneck, where he
lives with his mother.
</P>
<P>
   He was thinking at first about trying a novel. But after talking
with Simon, he has decided to continue in the style of ``Grand
Central Winter,'' writing nonfiction based on his experiences. He
does not worry about running out of material.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was alone with myself,'' he said of his years of
homelessness. ``Then I began to relate with people. Now I'm
beginning to fly, in my life and in my writing. My life now is like
reading a book _ you don't look ahead, you don't reread. Just trust
it and go on and let it take me somewhere.''
