<HEADLINE> Paltrow Wins Best Actress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gwyneth Paltrow won the best actress Oscar on  
Sunday for her role as the object of a young Bard's affections in 
``Shakespeare in Love.'' Roberto Benigni, as an Italian Jew 
shielding his son from the horrors of the Holocaust in ``Life is 
Beautiful,'' became the first star of a foreign film to win the 
best actor prize. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel very deserving of this in your presence,'' a  
sobbing Paltrow said, naming her fellow nominees. 
</P>
<P>
	With four top awards still to come, ``Shakespeare'' had five  
Oscars and ``Saving Private Ryan'' four, while ``Life Is 
Beautiful'' had three. After last year's 11-Oscar blowout by 
``Titanic,'' the movie crowd seemed to welcome a real race this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The tragi-comic ``Life is Beautiful,'' which Benigni also wrote  
and directed, won additional Academy Awards for foreign film and 
dramatic score. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a terrible mistake because I used up all my English,''  
he said, as he leapt to the stage for the second time. 
</P>
<P>
	Judi Dench, who played the imperious but fair-minded Queen  
Elizabeth I in ``Shakespeare in Love,'' and James Coburn, the 
alcoholic, abusive father in ``Affliction,'' won best supporting 
Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saving Private Ryan,'' Steven Spielberg's bloody depiction of  
World War II combat which figured to be ``Shakespeare's'' big 
competition for the major awards, took prizes for cinematography, 
editing, sound and sound effects editing. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Coburn Wins Supporting Actor Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Veteran James Coburn, who played the  
alcoholic, abusive father in ``Affliction,'' won the best 
supporting actor award at Sunday night's Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been doing this work for like over half my life, and I  
finally got one right, I guess,'' said the 71-year-old actor, whose 
dozens of films include ``Our Man Flint.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare in Love,'' which led all contenders with 13  
nominations, picked up the Oscar for art direction. 
</P>
<P>
	Host Whoopi Goldberg got the show off to a rousing start when  
she came out in full regalia as Queen Elizabeth I -- who appears in 
two of this year's contenders -- getting a rousing ovation, then a 
laugh when she announced: ``I am the African Queen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She joked about being the last master of ceremonies of the  
century and millennium, saying: 
</P>
<P>
	``I am the last 20th century fox.''  
</P>
<P>
	After last year's blowout by ``Titanic,'' the movie crowd seemed  
to welcome a real race this year: between Steven Spielberg's 
unrelenting ``Saving Private Ryan'' and the romantic Elizabethan 
fantasy, ``Shakespeare in Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Or would those two giants split the ballots, bestowing the Oscar  
for best picture on ``Elizabeth,'' ``Life Is Beautiful'' or ``The 
Thin Red Line''? 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of a runaway favorite helped make the 71st Academy  
Awards among the most anticipated in recent history. With two well 
received films as the leaders, the campaign for votes was conducted 
largely in Hollywood trade paper and newspaper ads. 
</P>
<P>
	Miramax, which often stages big-money campaigns for its Oscar  
candidates and succeeded two years ago with a best-picture win for 
``The English Patient,'' laid out millions for ``Shakespeare in 
Love'' ads. 
</P>
<P>
	DreamWorks was forced to counter with an estimated $4 million to  
promote its ``Saving Private Ryan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The battle of the dueling studios prompted calls for  
restrictions on campaign expenses. But, as in the political arena, 
no one has proposed how to limit the expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
	The Elia Kazan controversy also contributed to the excitement  
over this year's awards. The dustup started after Karl Malden 
proposed an honorary award for the director of ``A Streetcar Named 
Desire,'' ``On the Waterfront,'' ``East of Eden,'' ``Gentleman's 
Agreement'' and other classics. The board of governors agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazan had long been criticized because he named names of his  
former Communist Party comrades before the House Un-American 
Activities committee in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	After the academy announced the honor, he was attacked as a  
traitor by those whose defiance of the committee placed them on the 
industry's blacklist. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The furor over the Kazan award overshadowed another honorary  
Oscar this year -- the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award to longtime 
producer-director Norman Jewison, whose credits include ``The 
Cincinnati Kid,'' ``In the Heat of the Night,'' ``Fiddler on the 
Roof'' and ``Moonstruck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian-born Jewison was hailed by the president of the  
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences as a ``superior 
craftsman through four decades of moviemaking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jewison's films have earned 45 Academy Award nominations and  
more than 10 Oscars, including a best picture award for the 1967 
film ``In the Heat of the Night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After years of presenting the Oscars on Monday, the academy  
switched to Sunday. The reason was obviously financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday nights routinely deliver bigger audiences, with four  
hours of prime television time vs. three for other nights. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus the academy could present a half-hour pre-show and sell  
more commercials. Also, the main ceremony was moved up by a 
half-hour, ensuring it would not go much past midnight in the East, 
when audiences have typically tuned out en masse. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's awards returned to the small but classy Dorothy  
Chandler Pavilion of the Los Angeles Music Center after several 
years at the larger, but less glamorous Shrine Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony was one of the last in a borrowed hall. If all goes  
well, the academy will present the awards in its own theater in a 
brand-new complex on Hollywood Boulevard in 2001. It will mark 
Oscar's first appearance in the Hollywood district of the city 
since 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, this year's Oscar presenter lineup was jam-packed with  
filmdom's biggest names, including Jack Nicholson, Anne Heche, 
Harrison Ford, Kim Basinger, Denzel Washington, Helen Hunt, Robin 
Williams and Annette Bening.

<HEADLINE> NY Gov. Criticized by GOP Hopefuls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- New York Gov. George Pataki came under fire  
Sunday from two contenders for the Republican presidential 
nomination over his call to remove the anti-abortion plank from the 
GOP's national platform. 
</P>
<P>
	The self-described ``pro-choice'' Pataki, just back from a  
two-day visit to New Hampshire, the traditional site of the 
nation's first presidential primary, is eyeing the race himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative commentator Pat Buchanan, appearing on ABC's ``This  
Week'' program, said removing the anti-abortion plank from the 
platform would ``start a civil war'' within the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Steve Forbes, appearing on NBC's ``Meet the Press,''  
said Pataki's support for abortion rights would disqualify him from 
being on a Forbes-led ticket. Last year, the millionaire publisher 
had said Pataki should be on every GOP candidate's short-list of 
potential running mates. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan said he did not know if he would mount a third party  
challenge if the GOP convention took Pataki's advice and eliminated 
the anti-abortion plank. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing separately on ABC, Pataki defended his call to ditch  
the anti-abortion platform, a message he espoused during the 
party's 1996 convention, but which has now drawn attention because 
of his personal interest in the presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should focus on what divides us from Democrats and not what  
divides us as Republicans,'' Pataki said.

<HEADLINE> Minnesota Player Alleges Payoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A former Minnesota basketball player who was  
kicked off the team says coach Clem Haskins gave him cash on 
several occasions while he was still playing. 
</P>
<P>
	Russ Archambault, who played for Minnesota during the 1996-97  
and 1997-98 seasons before being bounced by Haskins, told the Star 
Tribune that the alleged payments usually totalled $200 to $300, 
often in $100 bills. Archambault said he believes he received seven 
to nine payments. 
</P>
<P>
	A payment said to have been made in 1997 was confirmed in part  
by his former tutor, Jeanne Payer, who said she drove Archambault 
to a Twin Cities mall to buy gifts for his mother after he received 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was just so surprised that coach would do that, pull him  
aside and say, `Don't tell anybody else,' '' Payer said. ``It 
struck him that that was so nice, and he must be special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report of the cash payments, along with a new claim by Payer  
that she wrote more than 50 academic papers for men's basketball 
players, widened the scope of allegations of academic fraud against 
the basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly two weeks ago, the Saint Paul Pioneer Press reported  
allegations from Payer's sister, Jan Gangelhoff, a former office 
manager in the university's academic counseling unit. Gangelhoff 
said that she wrote hundreds of papers for players from 1993 to 
1998, igniting an investigation into academic fraud at the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
	Cash payments to athletes are serious National Collegiate  
Athletic Association violations -- infractions that could bring 
severe penalties for Haskins and the basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
	The special work that Payer and Gangelhoff say they did also  
appears to violate NCAA rules, as well as rules of the university. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins was not available Sunday for comment on the most recent  
allegations. He has denied any knowledge of academic misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Payer told the Star Tribune Saturday that she collaborated with  
at least three former and current players on the 50 papers that she 
allegedly helped write. 
</P>
<P>
	Employees of the university's academic counseling unit are  
required to sign university employment forms stating that they will 
abide by NCAA and university rules that prohibit ``the researching 
of or typing of student reports/papers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Payer was a tutor, but said she also helped write papers.  
</P>
<P>
	``I did a little bit of both,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Payer said Haskins never asked her to write papers for players.  
She said that she met with him only once and that the conversation 
involved whether she thought a player she was tutoring was capable 
of doing his work. 
</P>
<P>
	However, she said she believed that the team's academic  
counselor Alonzo Newby knew the details of her work. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was never anything specifically said, `don't do this,'  
or `don't do that,' but it was clear that it was important that 
assignments be turned in for eligibility.

	'Life is Beautiful' Best Foreign Film  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Robert Benigni's 'Life is Beautiful' got the  
nod as the best foreign film during tonight's Academy Awards. The 
Italian director wrote, directed and starred in the tragicomedy 
about a father who protects his son from the horrors of the 
Holocaust. Earlier, Judi Dench, who played the imperious but 
fair-minded Queen Elizabeth I in ``Shakespeare in Love,'' and James 
Coburn, the alcoholic, abusive father in ``Affliction,'' won best 
supporting Oscars.

	Ex-Hostage Anderson Suing Iran  
</P>
<P>
	ATHENS, Ohio (AP) -- Terry Anderson is set to sue Iran for $100  
million over the more than six years the former Associated Press 
correspondent was held hostage, shackled and blindfolded, in 
Lebanon. The lawsuit accuses Iran of having sponsored his captors. 
The lawsuit, to be filed tomorrow, is also likely to become a 
challenge to the U.S. government. The Clinton administration has 
thwarted plaintiffs in similar lawsuits from collecting millions of 
dollars awarded by U.S. courts. Anderson was taken captive in 
Beirut on March 16, 1985, and was freed 2,454 days later, on Dec. 
4, 1991.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hours before a last-ditch diplomatic peace  
effort is to be made in Kosovo, a top Yugoslav Army general said 
his troops are ready ``to repel any aggression against our 
country.'' The U.S. is sending special envoy Richard Holbrooke to 
meet with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic tomorrow night. 
Airstrikes are likely to follow if the talks end with Milosevic 
defiant on two counts: still refusing a Kosovo peace plan and 
persisting in pressing an offensive against outgunned Kosovo 
rebels.

illness at a Milwaukee nursing home where he had been living, an 
employee said. After working for UPI in Washington, D.C., Reedy 
joined the U.S. Senate staff of Johnson, a Texas Democrat, in 1951. 
Reedy stayed with Johnson, only to break away in 1966 over 
disagreements about Johnson's pursuit of the Vietnam War.

	Train Crash Statements May Conflict

	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- Witnesses to the deadly Amtrak train  
crash may have given conflicting statements about whether a 
steel-laden truck was on the tracks before warning signals and 
crossing gates activated. ``We have not been able to completely 
reconcile the statements that are possibly conflicting,'' said 
National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Jamie Finch. He 
would not comment on what the possible conflicts were. Eleven 
people were killed and more than 100 injured in when the Amtrak 
train crashed into the truck on March 15.

person was killed and eight were wounded by the radio-controlled 
device, said the president's press secretary, according to the

slash total output by more than 2 million barrels a day. The new 
quotas, which are to begin April 1, would remain in effect for a 
full year. Under the deal reached at The Hague, Saudi Arabia, which

<HEADLINE> US Says Jordan Must Make Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Jordan stands to benefit from joining the  
World Trade Organization, but it must first introduce copyright and 
other legislation to meet membership requirements, U.S. Ambassador 
William Burns said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	He told an informal press briefing that if Jordan fails to win  
WTO membership next year, ``the likelihood of the criteria are 
going to get tougher than the ones now employed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``By becoming a member of the WTO you open up all sorts of  
opportunities'' such as attracting investment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he added, ``WTO membership is not an easy process'' because  
Parliament would need to enact many laws relating to intellectual 
property rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Jordan has taken encouraging steps to end piracy,  
``there is still more that needs to be done,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan has introduced several legislative proposals in an effort  
to attract foreign capital that would help ease the burdens of $6.1 
billion foreign debts. But no legislation protecting intellectual 
property has been enacted yet. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is one of Jordan's largest donors. It has  
contributed tens of millions of dollars on development projects 
here. Its economic and military aid to Jordan in the next three 
years is estimated to be $1 billion.

<HEADLINE> Rangers Wetteland May Start on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. (AP) -- Texas Rangers reliever John  
Wetteland may start the season on the disabled list because of a 
string of injuries during spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	Wetteland, slowed by an ankle injury last month and muscle  
spasms in his lower back, was told by manager Johnny Oates not to 
pitch in games for another four days. The All-Star closer is to be 
evaluated on Monday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wetteland made his first spring appearance March 12 and in two  
appearances last week allowed six runs in an inning, lacking 
command of his fastball. 
</P>
<P>
	``The delivery that I saw on Thursday, I didn't like it at  
all,'' Oates said. ``He just can't push off on that ankle well 
enough for me. I'm not sure this is something we can fight through. 
I'm not sure he can pitch that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oates' original plan was for Wetteland to pitch either Saturday  
or Sunday against the Reds, but the back spasms prevented him from 
getting on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	Wetteland attributed the spasms to overcompensating in his  
delivery because of the injured ankle. He said the ankle soreness 
has been making him depend on upper body strength, putting more 
pressure on his back.

<HEADLINE> Weather Postpones Women's Super-G </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Utah (AP) -- The women's super-G race at the U.S.  
Championships was postponed Sunday after changing weather left the 
hill more fit for sled dogs than alpine racers. 
</P>
<P>
	The course at Snowbasin Ski Resort, which had already suffered  
through a week of unseasonably high temperatures, was hit by rain 
Saturday night and light snow hours before the race. Organizers 
twice pushed back the race's start before postponing it entirely. 
</P>
<P>
	If the weather doesn't improve in the coming days and the race  
is canceled, it will be the third time in the last five years that 
the United States is unable to crown a women's super-G national 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
	The race was also called off because of poor snow at Snowbasin  
in 1995 and last year at Jackson Hole, Wyo. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an absolutely right decision,'' women's super-G coach  
Jim Tracy said. ``It certainly wasn't canceled due to a lack of 
effort on the part of the course crews and volunteers ... but it's 
always better to be safe than sorry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can always race another day.''  
</P>
<P>
	That day could be Tuesday, the only open date left on the  
women's schedule. The men's super-G championships are scheduled for 
Snowbasin on Monday, while the women are slated to run the giant 
slalom at Park City Mountain Resort. 
</P>
<P>
	Women's head coach Marjan Cernigoj said there were three  
distinct zones of snow conditions on the mountain after the 
unpredictable weather. New snow was at the top of the run, but 
conditions deteriorated down the length of the course until 
reaching the warm and slushy snow at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was terrible all the way down,'' said skier Katie Monahan,  
who won an FIS downhill race on the course on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Actress Lane Hopes for Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two decades ago, Diane Lane was hyped as the  
hottest teen actress of her generation. The ups and downs that 
followed made her an expert in growing up too fast. 
</P>
<P>
	After her debut at age 14 in ``A Little Romance,'' Lane hit it  
big as a rising star in ``The Outsiders'' and ``Rumble Fish.'' 
Movie offers poured in, along with growing pains. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did everything wrong there was to do,'' Lane, 34, says in  
Sunday's Daily News. ``When I was 18, I was very uncomfortable with 
the heat of the spotlight coming at me. I'd just done `Streets of 
Fire' and `Cotton Club,' and I ran for the hills. I had to have a 
perspective adjustment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some bad role choices followed, as did a doomed marriage to  
actor Christopher Lambert that produced 5-year-old daughter 
Eleanor. Now she's hoping for a major comeback with her upcoming 
film, ``Walking on the Moon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Life remains difficult for the single mother, but now the  
difficulties seem like character-building challenges rather than 
ego-crushing obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got through my precocious teen-age mess. Aren't I now  
allowed to enjoy things?'' she asked jokingly. ``But no, I'm a role 
model and a mother.''

<HEADLINE> Lady Vols Playing Mind Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- For Tennessee coach Pat Summitt, it's  
March Mindset. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the time of year her motivational demands take on new  
urgency, with more talk about mental toughness than on Xs and Os. 
</P>
<P>
	Next up for Summitt and the top-seeded Lady Volunteers (31-2) is  
an NCAA East Regional title game against Duke (27-6) on Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have maintained the commitment to going out and being the  
best team in March with more or less talent,'' said Summitt, whose 
program has won three straight NCAA titles and 21 straight 
tournament games. ``You've got to look at your team and look at 
your opposition and think about how you have to influence them. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this time of year it's a lot about being mentally strong  
and disciplined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Summitt didn't necessarily see that kind of team in December  
when Tennessee beat the Blue Devils 74-60. 
</P>
<P>
	``We go out and play Duke in early December and we're in foul  
trouble,'' Summitt said Sunday. ``Our sophomores are older and 
wiser now and hopefully they won't be sitting with me (Monday 
night) in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	``They understand that you help by stopping penetration, not by  
fouling people. That's something that takes mental discipline. We 
talk a lot about that, it's attitude, and not to let anything 
throughout the course of the game take us off our course, not to 
panic. It's a 40-minute game and this team has learned that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The title game will be at Greensboro Coliseum, about one hour  
from the Duke campus. But the Lady Volunteers will have thousands 
more fans than the Blue Devils will. 
</P>
<P>
	``That has become such a part of our program,'' Summitt said of  
the orange-clad fans. ``It really inspires our team. There have 
been a lot of times (the fans) have been our sixth player and 
they'll get this team going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lady Vols have advanced to 11 Final Fours since 1982, while  
the Blue Devils have never gone that far. Duke lost to Arkansas 
last season in the West Regional championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke coach Gail Goestenkors welcomes a rematch with Tennessee.  
</P>
<P>
	``Whether we want to admit it or not we were a little  
intimidated going on the floor with them that first game,'' 
Goestenkors said. ``It took us a half to get through that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goestenkors thinks a tough early schedule and the demanding play  
of the Atlantic Coast Conference has toughened her team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're older, we're wiser, we're smarter and we're much  
healthier,'' Goestenkors said. ``We've grown as a team to 
understand our roles a little bit better, who the shooters are, 
when we need to get the ball inside, who is hot and how do we get 
them the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee All-American Chamique Holdsclaw is closing her career  
with a flourish. The 6-foot-2 forward has scored 23, 39 and 27 
points in her three NCAA tournament games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to go out there and leave everything on the  
court,'' Holdsclaw said. 
</P>
<P>
	She'll be guarded by Duke sophomore Georgia Schweitzer.  
</P>
<P>
	``You just try to keep her from taking over the game,''  
Schweitzer said.

<HEADLINE> Missile Defense System Debated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress has put the Pentagon on a crash  
course to building a multibillion dollar defense against missile 
attacks on the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	But will the system work?  
</P>
<P>
	Even the Pentagon, which has spent about $50 billion on missile  
defense work over the past three decades, admits it cannot yet say. 
After six more years and an additional $10 billion, it hopes to be 
able to answer yes. 
</P>
<P>
	To understand the uncertainty facing this suddenly popular  
project, which the Pentagon calls National Missile Defense, 
consider that the high-tech rocket that would shoot down an 
incoming missile has not been tested. The first test is due this 
summer, and the final one not until 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The missile interceptor is ``the least mature element'' of the  
defensive system, Air Force Lt. Gen. Lester Lyles, director of the 
Pentagon office coordinating the project, told Congress in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	If the tests prove successful, the Pentagon intends to build 61  
of these anti-missile missiles, he said. They would be placed at 
ground stations in either Alaska or North Dakota, possibly both. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate voted 97-3 last week for a bill that declares the  
United States will build a missile defense ``as soon as 
technologically possible.'' It set no target date. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the House passed a similar bill that said: ``It is  
the official policy of the United States to deploy a national 
missile defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon's timetable envisions an initial missile defense  
system ready for use by 2005. Defense Secretary William Cohen told 
Congress on March 2 that the target date -- pushed back this year 
from 2003 -- still carries a ``high risk'' of failure. 
</P>
<P>
	That means the current $10 billion estimate for making the  
system ready for use in six years may be too low by billions. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said that in June 2000, the Pentagon will review the  
progress and decide whether the time is right to commit to the 
system. Many private analysts believe Cohen will conclude that it 
is too early to decide. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial system could defend all 50 states, but only against  
a handful of long-range ballistic missiles fired from a potential 
enemy with a poorly developed missile force, such as North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	It would have only ``residual capabilities'' against missiles  
fired by an established nuclear power like Russia or China, Lyles 
said. The established powers' missiles have more sophisticated 
means of overcoming a defense. 
</P>
<P>
	David Wright, an analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists,  
disputes the Pentagon's claim that its planned missile defense 
would work against the most rudimentary long-range missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe it,'' Wright said in an interview.  
</P>
<P>
	He contends a country like North Korea that has invested enough  
to build an intercontinental ballistic missile would spend what it 
needed for effective ``countermeasures,'' decoys and other onboard 
devices to fool an American anti-missile system. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials emphasize that this anti-missile system  
will be a far cry from former President Reagan's unfulfilled vision 
of a ``Star Wars'' shield that could knock thousands of enemy 
missiles from the sky. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reagan plan included high-powered lasers based in space that  
would zap missiles in flight. Adapting that idea, the Air Force is 
working on an airborne laser that would be fired from an airplane 
to ``kill'' a hostile missile during its ``boost phase,'' the 
earliest stage of flight. The airborne laser, however, is designed 
for use against shorter-range missiles, not as part of a national 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	The national missile defense now on the drawing board would be  
based mostly on the ground. The only space-based element, at least 
initially, would be defense satellites that can detect the 
launching of a potentially hostile missile and alert ground-based 
radars of where the threatening missile is headed. 
</P>
<P>
	A ``battle management center,'' probably at the Cheyenne  
Mountain air defense complex in Colorado, would evaluate options 
for shooting down the incoming missile. When the missile crossed 
into the range of ground-based early-warning radars, the radars 
would confirm flight and tracking information on the missile. That 
would allow battle ``managers'' to direct the launch of the 
interceptor rocket. 
</P>
<P>
	Sensors on the interceptor rocket would provide final, precise  
course corrections to enable the rocket's ``kill vehicle'' to slam 
directly into the target missile, destroying it and exploding its 
warhead. 
</P>
<P>
	Will it work?  
</P>
<P>
	``We can't afford to fail,'' Cohen said recently.

<HEADLINE> Space Stayion Crew May Launch Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Astronauts and cosmonauts may start  
moving into the international space station sooner than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the latest twist in a program that has dragged on for 15  
years and is still bogged down in politics and economics. 
</P>
<P>
	Eager to move beyond the turmoil, NASA is considering launching  
the station's first permanent crew as early as October, rather than 
in February 2000 as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	The pros, according to NASA: An early crew could handle any  
problems that crop up with the Russian-made living quarters, to be 
launched to the fledgling space station no earlier than September. 
What's more, an early crew would get Americans more interested and 
Russians more committed. 
</P>
<P>
	The cons: Because an early crew would leapfrog over shuttle  
supply flights, the station might not be ready to house all three 
men. So one man might have to stay behind, at least until the next 
shuttle arrived with additional cargo. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaving the lone American behind is not an option, says NASA's  
Gretchen McClain, deputy associate administrator for space station. 
She'd rather have the whole crew wait than bump William Shepherd, 
the station commander. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is that Shepherd, 49, a Navy captain and three-time  
shuttle flier, is not qualified to operate the Russian Soyuz 
capsule that will carry the first residents to the space station. 
The two other crewmen, both Russian cosmonauts, are experienced 
Soyuz fliers. 
</P>
<P>
	So the debate over whether to launch the crew early -- and, if  
so, how many can go -- goes on. 
</P>
<P>
	The two space programs will discuss the matter next month in  
Moscow. A decision likely won't be made, however, until much later. 
</P>
<P>
	``As much as I'd like to say we ought to go do it if we can, we  
need to make sure we've asked all the right questions,'' McClain 
says. ``We'd have to have a real good story why we'd go change our 
concept.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It might be more prudent, for instance, to launch the crew one  
month early instead of four, says McClain. 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, everything hinges on Russia's still-incomplete crew  
quarters, a 43-foot cylinder that will double as a crucial control 
or so-called service module. No one can move into the space 
station, and no other compartments can be attached, until the 
service module and its life-support systems are in place. 
</P>
<P>
	The compartment already is 1 1/2 years behind schedule because of  
inadequate Russian government funding. It held up space station 
assembly for a full year; the first two pieces didn't soar until 
November and December. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian space officials hope to ship the service module from  
Moscow to the launch site in Kazakstan in mid-April. Months of 
testing will follow. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian Space Agency is aiming for a late September launch  
of the module. McClain calls that ``doable but aggressive.'' The 
launch date, she says, will depend on how many problems pop up in 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest issue continues to be the funding,'' she says.  
</P>
<P>
	And that funding, meager as it is, continues to be sapped by  
Mir. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week, Russian space officials canceled at least two  
spacewalks by Mir cosmonauts -- not enough money, they explained. If 
Russia cannot afford routine spacewalks, how can it afford to 
finish the service module and take part in the new space station, 
observers wonder. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many other pieces of hardware and services that  
Russia has promised to provide and, to the best of my knowledge, 
NASA doesn't see much progress on any of those,'' says Marcia 
Smith, a specialist in space policy for the Congressional Research 
Service in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Staffing the international space station a few months early may  
be ``a good game plan to get the Russian government interested,'' 
Smith says. But the idea loses its appeal, she says, if the United 
States has to pay for the Russian supply ships that would be needed 
ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	To keep the service module progressing, NASA shelled out $60  
million last year to the Russian Space Agency. NASA has $100 
million available this year to assist the Russians, if necessary, 
but then that would be it, McClain says. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith questions such tactics.  
</P>
<P>
	``If this is going to be a long-standing financial commitment on  
the part of the United States to keep sending money over there to 
buy this or buy that, I'm not sure that's a partnership,'' Smith 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless private investors can be found in the next month, Russian  
space officials say they will send the 13-year-old Mir crashing 
into the Pacific Ocean in August. That would free up not only money 
but Soyuz spaceships and Progress supply ships for the 
international space station. 
</P>
<P>
	Staffing the international space station as soon as possible  
after Mir's demise should ease the pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps them sell the concept of deorbiting the Mir,''  
McClain says. 
</P>
<P>
	What's more, McClain says, the sooner the international space  
station is occupied, the sooner ``the general public will start 
really understanding what it is that we're doing with the space 
station and become a little bit more interested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith doubts the interest will last long.  
</P>
<P>
	``It will be very good publicity for a couple of weeks,'' she  
says, ``and then it will fade just like Skylab faded and just like 
Mir has faded.''

<HEADLINE> Chaney Hurt by Temple's Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The rings under John Chaney's eyes  
seemed deeper and darker than before, etched there like a 
basketball purple heart, earned trying to figure out a way to deal 
with Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	This is not the recommended treatment for a 67-year-old man  
fighting the flu. 
</P>
<P>
	The Temple coach looked exhausted Sunday, a black scarf slung  
around his neck, a futile acknowledgment of the lingering illness 
he endured during the NCAA tournament's East Regional. 
</P>
<P>
	The flu was bad. The 85-64 battering administered by the Blue  
Devils didn't exactly help. 
</P>
<P>
	This was textbook stuff. Chaney chose to shut off the inside  
early against Elton Brand. So the Dukies did the logical thing. 
They went outside to Trajan Langdon, whose shots found the basket 
as if drawn by a magnet. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had enough intelligence,'' Chaney said, smiling thinly  
though the sniffles. ``Once they found out we were diving, covering 
back and forth to Brand, they opened it up. They had five guys 
outside and nobody inside. Then they had four guys outside and one 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got wisdom. You don't get wisdom till you get old,  
like me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chaney came into this game convinced Temple had a chance to  
derail the Duke locomotive that now has won a school-record 31 
consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
	He told his team that he stayed up half the night, thinking of  
how to win, preparing to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never prepare a team to lose,'' he said. ``You can see  
death a thousand times, but you never prepare for death and you 
never prepare to lose. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought in our bracket, the only team with a chance to beat  
Duke was our team. We work from the beginning to develop will and 
discipline and a feeling for each other. We work on character 
building.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All those good things took Temple only so far.  
</P>
<P>
	Chaney did as much as he could on the sidelines. The tie came  
loose early, unknotted this time to show the urgency of the 
situation. The jacket was shed as Duke methodically wore down the 
matchup zone that had befuddled so many other teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Time after time, the Blue Devils found Langdon open for  
3-pointers. It's not like Chaney didn't know about the fifth-year 
senior's long-range shooting ability. 
</P>
<P>
	``He only needs to look through a hole in a needle to see the  
basket,'' he said. ``He's as pure a shooter as I've seen in 
basketball. He's just that good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Duke lengthened its lead, Chaney became more exasperated. One  
of Langdon's 3's sent him to his knees, pleading for help from some 
place, any place. 
</P>
<P>
	Temple knew what was coming. The Owls just couldn't do much  
about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like the old football coach, a Green Bay coach, I  
think,'' Chaney said. ``He told the writers, `We're going around 
right end every time.' They asked him why he was telling what he 
was going to do. He said, `They know what we're going to do. They 
just don't know how well.' Langdon will hit his shots. We just 
didn't know how well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chaney did everything he could for his team, cajoling,  
lecturing, pleading for calls, not getting many of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, the frustration led to a technical foul. He wasn't  
about to discuss officiating. He's been in enough games in enough 
gyms to know that would only cost him money. 
</P>
<P>
	As the clock wound down, it was clear there wasn't much Temple  
could do about a Duke team that seems just too good. Chaney saw the 
inevitable coming and accepted it. 
</P>
<P>
	Losing is never painless. Yet the pain wasn't quite as fierce on  
Sunday for Chaney. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a class about that team that I expect from my team,''  
he said of Duke.'' It's not `Shazamm,' and it happens. Sometimes 
you can make winners out of people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that is Chaney's agenda.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have many more mountains to cross,'' he said. ``I look  
at winning like others. It's more than winning, though. It's 
developing kids. I want my team to head on the bus and look at a 
time when the wind will be at their backs. We teach not to play the 
last play but to go on with our lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then he offered one last thought on Mike Krzyzewski's Blue  
Devils. 
</P>
<P>
	``His team is similar to mine,'' he said. ``He just has better  
athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That'll do it everytime.

<HEADLINE> Oscarcast: Long, Dull and Tacky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Grazie from at least one grateful viewer to  
Roberto Benigni! 
</P>
<P>
	The excitable, ecstatic writer-director-star of ``Life Is  
Beautiful'' was almost the sole salvation of ``The 71st Annual 
Academy Awards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Could this year's Oscarcast have been any duller? Only if the  
Italian comic superstar hadn't been on hand to accept two Oscars in 
his rapid-fire, euphoric broken English. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to kiss everybody,'' he said after stepping from  
seat-back to seat-back to reach the stage for his best foreign 
language film trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	A little while later, the Oscarcast got another welcome wakeup  
call when Benigni returned to claim the best actor award: ``I would 
like to be Jupiter and kidnap everybody,'' he bubbled, ``and lie 
down in the firmament making love with everybody!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Who knows what would have gone on had he won a third?  
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, the broadcast, which ABC aired live from Los Angeles'  
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion Sunday night, was almost unrelievedly 
rated zzzzzzzzzzzzz. And it couldn't all be blamed on the show's 
record-breaking length: 4 hours, 2 minutes. The show was just dull. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the much-awaited climax to the drama surrounding Elia  
Kazan's life achievement award fell flat. 
</P>
<P>
	``More than anybody, he inspired us,'' said Robert De Niro three  
hours into the broadcast. De Niro had joined director Martin 
Scorsese to present the award, an object of bitter debate between 
admirers of the great director and those who denounced him for 
naming colleagues in a government investigation of communist 
influence on Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	Viewers saw that Warren Beatty and Meryl Streep were among those  
who stood and applauded. Nick Nolte and Ed Harris were among those 
who sat in stony silence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank you all very much,'' said the 89-year-old Kazan. ``I  
think I can just slip away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that was that.  
</P>
<P>
	In her third turn as host, Whoopi Goldberg had little new to  
offer the broadcast. Hers was the same tacky, self-satisfied 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Her appearances in various Oscar-related costumes, beginning  
with the finery of Queen Elizabeth (not to mention in white-face), 
should have been funny. But Goldberg has a fixation on rude double 
entendres and bodily functions that coarsens everything. 
</P>
<P>
	Observing that William Shakespeare has had a good year in the  
movies, Goldberg purred suggestively, ``Little Willie is very 
large.'' Then there were her quips about ``leaks,'' horse manure, 
and -- well, even if you weren't watching, you're surely familiar 
with grade-school-level risqueness. 
</P>
<P>
	After one of these wisecracks, she made a cackling reference to  
frequent Oscarcast host Billy Crystal: ``You're missin' Billy just 
about now, aincha?'' 
</P>
<P>
	If you only knew, Whoopi.

<HEADLINE> Four Teams Headed to St. Petersburg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Three No. 1 seeds and one of the best turnaround stories in  
college basketball history are headed for St. Petersburg, Fla., and 
the 61st Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	Top-ranked Duke, Connecticut and Michigan State were among the  
favorites to get there since the preseason poll had them ranked 
Nos. 1, 2 and 5. Ohio State, coming off an 8-22 season, didn't even 
crack the Top 25 until January but went on to earn a No. 4 seeding 
in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	All four will be there this weekend and Connecticut, which is in  
the Final Four for the first time in school history, will play Ohio 
State, which hasn't been there since 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke, which is making its fifth Final Four appearance of the 90s  
but first in five years, will play Michigan State, a school that 
was last there 20 years ago when a newcomer named Magic Johnson led 
the Spartans to the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's probably as good a day as we've had at Michigan State in  
a long, long time,'' coach Tom Izzo said. ``To battle back against 
a great, great Kentucky team says a lot about our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke's 85-64 victory over sixth-seeded Temple in the East  
Regional on Sunday means the Atlantic Coast Conference has had at 
least one representative in the Final Four every year since 1988, 
except for 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut, which beat 10th-seeded Gonzaga 67-62 Saturday to  
win the West Regional, becomes just the second Big East team in the 
Final Four in the 90s, joining Syracuse in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State, which beat St. John's 77-74 Saturday to win the  
South Regional, and Michigan State, which beat defending national 
champion Kentucky 73-66 Sunday in the Midwest, gives the Big Ten 
the first multi-berth Final Four since the Southeastern Conference 
had two teams in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	A five-year absence from the Final Four would be a deal most  
schools would take with a smile. Duke (36-1) is not most schools 
when it comes to Final Fours. 
</P>
<P>
	For the 12th time in school history, and the eighth time under  
coach Mike Krzyzewski, the Blue Devils are in the national 
semifinals and they go in on a school-record 31-game winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
	The closest game Duke has had in the tournament was a 17-point  
win over Southwest Missouri State in the regional semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's still two games to go and maybe I shouldn't brag,''  
junior guard Chris Carrawell said, ``but this team has everything 
you could possibly want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State (33-4) has won 22 straight games, the last three  
all by less than 10 points in the tournament. Saturday's game will 
be a rematch with Duke as the Blue Devils beat the Spartans 73-67 
in the Great Eight in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut (32-2), the only other team besides Duke to be  
ranked No. 1 this season, had always seemed to find a way not to 
get to the Final Four. Whether it was a buzzer-beater by Duke's 
Christian Laettner or a path that went through North Carolina's 
home state, the Huskies had never gotten there. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the team with the college basketball's largest media  
contingent and a fervent following in a state without a 
professional franchise, is there. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fate and other good teams and players got in the way and we  
didn't move on,'' explained Jim Calhoun, who can now remove his 
name from the list of the sport's best coaches not to reach the 
Final Four. ``I'm sure ours fans our going to come en masse. 
There's nothing like HuskyMania. People don't realize how much 
people in our state care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State (27-8) shattered one of the Final Four's revered bits  
of trivia. No team had ever reached the national semifinals without 
having been in the tournament the year before. Now the answer is 
the Buckeyes, who were 8-22 last season and won just one conference 
game. The addition of guard Scoonie Penn, who came along with coach 
Jim O'Brien from Boston College, was the key to the remarkable 
turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said when we came here we'd had a great season but it had  
to end here,'' Buckeyes guard Michael Redd said. ``I wonder what 
they're going to say now?''

<HEADLINE> Jamaica Criticizes US on Banana War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTEGO BAY, Jamaica (AP) -- Jamaica's leader charged Sunday that  
the U.S. assault on the region's banana exports is a threat to the 
survival of some nations, a reflection of mounting anger toward the 
United States throughout the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
	``What has prompted the United States administration to take so  
hostile a position to countries as small as we are and as 
vulnerable as we are?'' asked Prime Minister P.J. Patterson, 
addressing a meeting of the Inter-American Press Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Patterson's bitter comments -- he described the U.S. position as  
the ``first skirmish'' of a ``world war'' on the global trade 
regime -- reflected broader malaise in a region which during the 
Cold War was a U.S. darling and now feels abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years U.S. aid to Caribbean nations has fallen from  
some $200 million a year to a tenth of that. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Caribbean leaders are incensed over U.S. efforts to get the  
World Trade Organization to revoke preferences given by some 
European countries to former colonies in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington says the preferences hurt U.S.-owned producers with  
huge plantations in Central and South America. Caribbean leaders 
say they are critical to keeping their vital banana industry viable 
during a difficult period, and emphasize that Caribbean bananas 
make up only 1 percent of world exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute escalated earlier this month as the United States  
ordered importers to deposit funds to cover pending sanctions on 
$520 million worth of targeted goods imported from the European 
Union. Caribbean nations joined the European Union in charging that 
the sanctions were illegal. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamaica, which already suffers from widespread poverty and high  
unemployment, depends on bananas for 10 percent of its economy, 
Patterson told The Associated Press. But in eastern Caribbean 
islands the figure is between 40 and 70 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. position, he maintained, ``is a very, very serious  
threat to the survival of many of the countries: the eastern 
Caribbean (islands), Jamaica, Suriname.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to take very concerted action to resist what is  
happening,'' Patterson added, without elaborating. 
</P>
<P>
	One possible response could come at a Caribbean summit in July,  
when Caribbean leaders are expected to discuss calls to suspend a 
treaty on helping the United States fight drug trafficking. Earlier 
this month, they decided to review the treaty, which allows U.S. 
law enforcers to pursue suspected drug traffickers into their 
territorial waters and airspace.

<HEADLINE> Buckeyes' Rise a Real Surprise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- The season started with Scoonie Penn's  
wildest dream. Now it's gone way, way beyond that. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State is headed for the Final Four for the first time in 31  
years and is coming out of nowhere to do it. 
</P>
<P>
	Just one year ago, the Buckeyes were 8-22, tying the school  
record for losses in a season, and 1-15 and last in the Big Ten. 
They lost a record 17 straight games at one point. 
</P>
<P>
	So when Penn, the transfer point guard from Boston College,  
predicted before the season that Ohio State would make it to the 
NCAA tournament, most people laughed at his naivete. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew we would turn it around, but not in my wildest dreams  
did I think we would make it to the Final Four this year,'' Penn 
said while being mobbed upon the team's arrival in Columbus early 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes will meet Connecticut on Saturday night in the  
national semifinals. Ohio State coach Jim O'Brien hasn't beaten 
UConn in 18 meetings. Then again, based on what's happened so far, 
no one's doubting there may be more magic left in the bottle. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State advanced after a 77-74 victory over St. John's in the  
South Regional final Saturday night in Knoxville, Tenn. -- the 
latest seismic shock produced by the Buckeyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you believe in miracles?'' The Columbus Dispatch wrote in  
its game story. ``If you still don't, you haven't been paying 
attention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds cheered the team when it arrived on campus Sunday  
morning. Hours earlier, a professional ice skating show at the 
team's home court, Value City Arena, was repeatedly disrupted by 
fans groaning and cheering. They listened on radios or watched on 
portable TVs as the Buckeyes held off St. John's in the final 
frantic seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is almost better than a football win over Michigan,'' one  
fan is this football-mad city said. 
</P>
<P>
	The basketball team had been all but forgotten the past five  
losing seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Since last making it to the NCAA tournament in 1992, the  
Buckeyes fell into ruin under coach Randy Ayers. The only time 
anyone said ``NCAA'' was when the program was put on probation for 
recruiting violations. The number of players kicked off the team or 
transferring reached double figures. And the losses mounted. 
</P>
<P>
	Ayers was fired following back-to-back 10-17 seasons. O'Brien  
was hired after several prominent coaches spurned offers from 
downtrodden Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Brien ran off three players, including two starters, six weeks  
before his first practice. Two others, including the team's best 
player, eventually were forced out. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn followed O'Brien to Ohio State from Boston College. After  
sitting out last year, he has joined with leading-scorer Michael 
Redd and a group of role players to capture the hearts of the 
doubters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I was going to be a spectator like everyone else,''  
O'Brien said of the Final Four. Then he laughed. 
</P>
<P>
	The squirming, giggling, celebrating pile of Buckeyes on the  
court after the final seconds of the regional final was the other 
end of the emotional spectrum from the misery of the 1997-98 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really is awesome,'' Redd said. ``To suffer the way we did  
last year and now to be on top where we are right now. It can't get 
any better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allegra Penn traveled from her hometown of Salem, Mass., to  
watch her son's dream come true. She looked at all the jubilation 
around her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him a week ago we were going to Florida -- that we would  
play St. John's and beat them,'' she said. ``I always taught him to 
think positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her son has passed that lesson on.

<HEADLINE> Mourning Loses Cool and Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- It took only a few seconds to undo a half-season's  
worth of goodwill by Alonzo Mourning. 
</P>
<P>
	The Miami Heat center, known for allowing his intense demeanor  
to boil over, had earned praise through the first seven weeks of 
the NBA season for being able to meet hard fouls and bad calls with 
a shrug -- even a smile. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Saturday night, the old Mourning resurfaced in the first  
half of Miami's 94-89 loss to Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard him say earlier in the year that he'd learned how to  
control himself in those situations,'' Pacers center-forward 
Antonio Davis said. ``I guess now it's back to the drawing board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the Heat trailing 31-27 and 5:11 left before halftime,  
Mourning was called for an offensive foul as teammate P.J. Brown 
was attempting a shot in the lane. It appeared Davis would be 
called for bumping Brown, but referee Ted Bernhardt ruled Mourning 
had pushed Davis into the shooter. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning, incredulous, flung his arms in frustration and yanked  
the gum out of his mouth to speak to Bernhardt. But he turned with 
such force that the first technical came quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Mourning would have grimaced -- maybe even smiled -- and  
turned away. But something kept him from doing so. 
</P>
<P>
	``He kept walking away from me,'' Mourning said. ``I just wanted  
to talk to him. That was my third foul and I need to be on the 
floor in a situation like that. The next time I'm in the game, I 
don't want to pick up a quick fourth. We need to address this now 
before he makes another call like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Things actually seemed rather benign as he walked alongside  
Bernhardt, occasionally pumping his arms to punctuate his point. 
Then suddenly, the referee turned, angrily jabbed his finger into 
Mourning's chest and called the second technical. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ted was looking at him the whole time and probably didn't like  
his body language,'' said Heat guard Terry Porter, who was the 
first to reach Mourning. He and Dan Majerle managed to steer their 
centerpiece away from Bernhardt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want him to do something stupid and miss the Utah  
game,'' Porter said. Miami next plays the Western Conference leader 
Tuesday night at Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	The scene brought to mind the end of Game 4 in last year's  
first-round playoff series against New York. With victory in hand 
for the Knicks, Mourning inexplicably began flailing away at Larry 
Johnson with 1.4 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourning said afterward that the Knicks pushed him over the edge  
by taking cheap shots at the left cheek he had broken earlier in 
the season. Still, it earned him a suspension for Game 5 -- and an 
early exit for the Heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Heat coach Pat Riley could be seen after that incident telling  
Mourning he'd just blown Miami's playoff chances. There was only 
one word for Mourning upon Saturday night's ejection -- Riley merely 
pointed in the direction of the locker room and said, ``Go.''. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a terrible call,'' Riley said afterward. ``You can get  
a `T,' but you can't push it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's too early to tell, but Mourning's outburst could affect the  
Heat's playoff standing. Though Miami remains one game ahead of 
Indiana in the Eastern Conference race, the Pacers now own the 
tiebreaker advantage with two wins in three meetings. They face 
each other one more time, April 18 at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were two mistakes made, one on his part and one on my  
part,'' Mourning said. ``They're (referees) human, just like I'm 
human. You just live and learn in a situation like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Again.

	'Shakespeare in Love' Wins 7 Oscars  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In a night of surprises and upsets, the  
romantic comedy ``Shakespeare in Love'' won seven Academy Awards on 
Sunday, including best picture and best actress for Gwyneth 
Paltrow. Steven Spielberg's bloody World War II epic ``Saving 
Private Ryan'' won the prize for directing and four other Oscars. 
Roberto Benigni, as an Italian Jew shielding his son from the 
horrors of the Holocaust in ``Life is Beautiful,'' stunned the 
audience by becoming the first star of a foreign film to win as 
best actor. The tragi-comic film, which Benigni also wrote and 
directed, won additional Academy Awards for foreign film and 
dramatic score.

blindfolded and shackled for more than six years. Similar lawsuits 
only became possible in recent years and at least three have won 
millions of dollars in judgments. Anderson, now 51 and teaching

<HEADLINE> Report: Aikman Went to Mobster Bash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman attended  
two parties hosted by Dominick Montemarano, a convicted racketeer, 
the Daily News reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the newspaper said that Aikman wasn't suspected of any  
wrongdoing. Aikman's agent, Leigh Steinberg, said the three-time 
Super Bowl winner had little contact with Montemarano. 
</P>
<P>
	``He went there with a friend, David Norrie, and never really  
spent any time with (Montemarano),'' Steinberg was quoted as 
saying. ``Troy had no idea about his background at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts by The Associated Press to reach Steinberg on Sunday  
were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	Norrie, a former UCLA quarterback like Aikman, said Aikman  
wasn't worried. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows he's done nothing wrong,'' Norrie said. ``He just  
went to a social gathering, where there were 20 or 30 other 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said that Rick Neuheisel, the recently appointed  
Washington football coach and former Colorado coach, also attended 
one of Montemarano's parties. He, too, said he was unaware of 
Montemarano's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	``David's a good friend and he invited me to one of Dominick's  
Monday Night Football parties when I was in town recruiting,'' 
Neuheisel told the newspaper. ``I had no idea who (Montemarano) 
was. I was shocked. ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montemarano was convicted of racketeering with mob boss Carmine  
Persico in 1986. He served 11 years of an 18-year sentence before 
being released. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, the News reported that Montemarano and current UCLA  
football players, including star quarterback Cade McNown, were the 
focus of a coast-to-coast point-shaving probe by the FBI. No 
evidence was found of any wrongdoing by any athlete.

<HEADLINE> Kwan Ready for World Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- While those around her stumbled,  
Michelle Kwan hit jump after jump with barely a miss. 
</P>
<P>
	She practiced Sunday with some of her major rivals at the world  
championships. And this much is clear: Kwan is ready. 
</P>
<P>
	The competition begins Monday with the men's qualifying group  
and the pairs short programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Russians -- Alexei Yagudin, Yevgeny Plushenko and Alexei  
Urmanov -- will vie for the men's title, with three-time world 
champion Elvis Stojko in the role of potential spoiler. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Kwan is the most luminous star of these championships. She  
has won the world title twice and is the only singles Olympic 
medalist competing in Helsinki. 
</P>
<P>
	Tara Lipinski, who took the Olympic gold and bronze medalist  
Chen Lu have gone pro. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan chose to stay eligible for the next Olympics although this  
is her only major International Skating Union competition of the 
season. She bypassed the Grand Prix schedule to concentrate on 
shows and TV. 
</P>
<P>
	But when it counted, she performed like a champion, easily  
winning the U.S. championship last month. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, she showed off her moves in practice with a group  
that included Tatiana Malinina of Uzbekistan and two Ukraine 
skaters who won European medals in the past, Elena Liashenko and 
Julia Lawrenchuk. 
</P>
<P>
	Malinina was the surprise winner at the Grand Prix final two  
weeks ago but lacks the choreographic poise that Kwan exhibits 
every time she is on the ice. Kwan was secure in all her jumps, 
including a triple-triple combination. 
</P>
<P>
	The other U.S. skaters, Sarah Hughes and Angela Nikodinov, were  
also practicing. Nikodinov is coached by Richard Callaghan in a 
brief arrangement that ended after the U.S. nationals, where she 
finished third. 
</P>
<P>
	Callaghan, who coached Lipinski to the gold medal at the  
Olympics, will retire this spring after 27 years in coaching. He 
resigned as director of skating at the Detroit Skating Club earlier 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The women begin their skating Wednesday with the qualification  
round that will cut the field from 42 to 30 skaters. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's qualifying counts for 20 percent of the total score  
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian trio of Yagudin, Plushenko and Urmanov are set to  
challenge each other again as they have throughout the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagudin is the current world and two-time European champion.  
Plushenko is the Russian champion and Urmanov won the Cup of Russia 
on the home rink of all three. 
</P>
<P>
	Stojko is the unknown factor. He has competed sporadically since  
tearing a groin muscle at the Nagano Olympics 13 months ago. And he 
has not done well, barely winning the Canadian title and coming in 
third at the Four Continents competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``At no time was my leg ever 100 percent until the last week or  
so,'' Stojko said. ``I don't feel any pain, It's as good as new.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then he issued a warning.  
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of power has come back into my jumps now,'' he said.  
That could turn into a routine with two quadruple jumps, including 
the quadruple-triple combination. 
</P>
<P>
	The top American, Michael Weiss, has an outside shot at a medal,  
especially if he completes a quad, as he has been attempting the 
past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The other Americans, Trifan Zivanovic and Tim Goebel, are  
relative newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
	The pairs events begins Monday evening with the short program,  
worth one-third the score. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champions Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze  
were considered favorites until recently. They had to withdraw from 
the European championships just before the free skate and she 
stumbled numerous times at the Grand Prix final. Shen Xue and Zhao 
Hongbo beat them at Grand Prix finals and are Four Contintents 
champs.

<HEADLINE> Benigni Wins Oscar as Best Actor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Roberto Benigni became the first performer in  
a foreign language film to win the Oscar for best actor for his 
role as a father shielding his son from the horrors of the 
Holocaust in ``Life is Beautiful'' at Sunday night's Academy 
Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	No surprise, ``Life Is Beautiful,'' Roberto Benigni's acclaimed  
tragicomedy about a father who protects his son from the horrors of 
the Holocaust, won as best foreign film. 
</P>
<P>
	Judi Dench, who played the imperious but fair-minded Queen  
Elizabeth I in ``Shakespeare in Love,'' and James Coburn, the 
alcoholic, abusive father in ``Affliction,'' won best supporting 
Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saving Private Ryan,'' Steven Spielberg's bloody depiction of  
World War II combat which figured to be ``Shakespeare's'' big 
competition for the major awards, took prizes for editing, sound 
and sound effects editing. 
</P>
<P>
	About halfway through the show ``Private Ryan'' and  
``Shakespeare'' had three Oscars each, and ``Life Is Beautiful'' 
two. After last year's 11-Oscar blowout by ``Titanic,'' the movie 
crowd seemed to welcome a real race this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The perpetually ebullient Benigni clambered over the backs of  
seats and hopped onto the stage after Sophia Loren openly rooted 
for her fellow Italian and announced his victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to kiss everybody,'' said Benigni, who was nominated  
for best director and actor, while the film was a best picture 
contender. ``Life Is Beautiful'' also won for best dramatic score. 
</P>
<P>
	Dench, who made an indelible impression despite her brief screen  
time in the romantic comedy, held up her gold statuette and said 
with a smile: ``I feel for eight minutes on the screen I should 
only get a little bit of him.' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first Oscar for the 64-year-old British stage  
actress, who had been nominated last year for playing a different 
queen, Victoria, in ``Mrs. Brown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coburn, 70, had never been nominated.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've been doing this work for like over half my life, and I  
finally got one right, I guess,'' said the veteran actor, whose 
dozens of films include ``Our Man Flint'' and ``The Magnificent 
Seven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of them you do for money, some of them you do for love.  
This is a love child,'' Coburn said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare in Love,'' which led all contenders with 13  
nominations, also picked up an early Oscar for art direction and 
best musical or comedy score, while ``Elizabeth'' won for makeup. 
</P>
<P>
	Host Whoopi Goldberg, who changed costumes repeatedly to mimic  
film characters, got the show off to a rousing start when she came 
out in full regalia as Elizabeth -- who figured in two of this 
year's contenders -- getting a rousing ovation, then a laugh when 
she announced with an accent that was more Bette Davis than 
British, ``I am the African Queen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She joked about being the last master of ceremonies of the  
century and millennium, saying: ``I am the last 20th century fox.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And referring to this year's furor over the special Oscar for  
director Elia Kazan, Goldberg joked: ``I thought the blacklist was 
Hattie McDaniel and me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lack of a runaway favorite helped make the 71st Academy  
Awards among the most anticipated in recent history. With two well 
received films as the leaders, the campaign for votes was conducted 
largely in Hollywood trade paper and newspaper ads. 
</P>
<P>
	Miramax, which often stages big-money campaigns for its Oscar  
candidates and succeeded two years ago with a best-picture win for 
``The English Patient,'' laid out millions for ``Shakespeare in 
Love'' ads. 
</P>
<P>
	DreamWorks was forced to counter with an estimated $4 million to  
promote its ``Saving Private Ryan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The battle of the dueling studios prompted calls for  
restrictions on campaign expenses. But, as in the political arena, 
no one has proposed how to limit the expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kazan controversy also contributed to the excitement over  
this year's awards. The dustup started after Karl Malden proposed 
an honorary award for the director of ``A Streetcar Named Desire,'' 
``On the Waterfront,'' ``East of Eden,'' ``Gentleman's Agreement'' 
and other classics. The board of governors agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazan had long been criticized because he named names of his  
former Communist Party comrades before the House Un-American 
Activities committee in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	After the academy announced the honor, he was attacked as a  
traitor by those whose defiance of the committee placed them on the 
industry's blacklist. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The furor over the Kazan award overshadowed another honorary  
Oscar this year -- the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award to longtime 
producer-director Norman Jewison, whose credits include ``The 
Cincinnati Kid,'' ``In the Heat of the Night,'' ``Fiddler on the 
Roof'' and ``Moonstruck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian-born Jewison was hailed by the president of the  
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences as a ``superior 
craftsman through four decades of moviemaking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jewison's films have earned 45 Academy Award nominations and  
more than 10 Oscars, including a best picture award for the 1967 
film ``In the Heat of the Night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After years of presenting the Oscars on Monday, the academy  
switched to Sunday. The reason was obviously financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday nights routinely deliver bigger audiences, with four  
hours of prime television time vs. three for other nights. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus the academy could present a half-hour pre-show and sell  
more commercials. Also, the main ceremony was moved up by a 
half-hour, ensuring it would not go much past midnight in the East, 
when audiences have typically tuned out en masse. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's awards returned to the small but classy Dorothy  
Chandler Pavilion of the Los Angeles Music Center after several 
years at the larger, but less glamorous Shrine Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony was one of the last in a borrowed hall. If all goes  
well, the academy will present the awards in its own theater in a 
brand-new complex on Hollywood Boulevard in 2001. It will mark 
Oscar's first appearance in the Hollywood district of the city 
since 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, this year's Oscar presenter lineup was jam-packed with  
filmdom's biggest names, including Jack Nicholson, Anne Heche, 
Harrison Ford, Kim Basinger, Denzel Washington, Helen Hunt, Robin 
Williams and Annette Bening.

<HEADLINE> Navy Servicemen Arrested in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Three U.S. Navy servicemen were arrested Sunday on  
suspicion of assaulting and robbing a taxi driver in downtown 
Tokyo, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police official Yasuhide Iki said the three are based at a U.S.  
naval base in Yokosuka, 30 miles southwest of Tokyo, which is the 
headquarters of the U.S. 7th Fleet. 
</P>
<P>
	Iki identified one of the suspects as Reed Jarrid Duarte, 22,  
but his hometown was not available. Iki declined to identify the 
other two because they were both 19 years old, and according to 
Japanese law, police must withhold the names of suspects who are 
under 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Iki said the three denied attacking the driver.  
</P>
<P>
	He quoted driver Koji Miura, 49, as telling police that he tried  
to give the three $25 change for their fare Saturday as they got 
off at Roppongi, a popular nightclub district in downtown Tokyo. 
One of the servicemen then allegedly punched him in the face and 
robbed him of another $25. 
</P>
<P>
	The three allegedly ran away, but police discovered them in  
streets nearby and arrested them, Iki said. Miura suffered a minor 
injury to his lip, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. military officials were not immediately available for  
comment.

<HEADLINE> Phillies Make Offer to Hershiser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) -- With the Indians in town, what better  
time for the Phillies to talk about Orel Hershiser? 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies made a second contract offer to the 40-year-old  
right-hander on Sunday, hoping to bolster a thin pitching staff 
that could use his experience -- and innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's enough, then great,'' general manager Ed Wade said  
before the Phillies beat the Indians 2-1. ``If not, then we move 
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In February, the Phillies offered Hershiser a one-year deal with  
incentives that could have raised the value to $2 million. He opted 
instead to sign a minor league contract for less money with the 
Indians, the team he played for from 1995-97. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hershiser, who pitched for the Giants last season, has  
little chance of making Cleveland's starting rotation. Hershiser 
and the Indians set a loose deadline of Sunday for the club to let 
him know how he fits into their plans. If he isn't going to make 
the club, Hershiser is free to sign with another team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd love to have Orel,'' Indians manager Mike Hargrove said.  
``But there's no job for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to getting the 10 victories he needs for 200 in his  
career, Hershiser wants one last chance to pitch in the World 
Series. The Phillies, still building with youth and a payroll under 
$30 million, don't appear to be a good bet to give him that this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, if the Phillies ask ace Curt Schilling to sell Hershiser  
on the Phillies, he'll gladly do it. 
</P>
<P>
	``His career is what it is,'' Schilling said Sunday after  
pitching five scoreless innings in a 2-1 victory over Cleveland. 
``He's 200 innings, and if he's healthy and throwing the ball the 
way he is, he could make us a better club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillies assistant general manager Ruben Amaro Jr. talked with  
Hershiser's agent, Robert Fraley, on Saturday and made the formal 
offer Sunday. Wade talked with Hart on Sunday morning to make sure 
it was within baseball rules to offer Hershiser a contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraley did not return a telephone call, Wade wouldn't say  
whether the second offer involved more money than the first -- 
$850,000 guaranteed and $2 million if he pitches 200 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is, I think, a very fair offer which includes performance  
bonuses,'' Wade said. ``It is the same type of offer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is believed that the Marlins, Devil Rays and another club  
offered more money that the Phillies last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser has pitched well this spring, posting a 2.70 ERA in  
three appearances. His value may have gone up since the Phillies 
made their first offer, perhaps pushing them out of the running. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's never been about the money with Hershiser,'' Wade said.  
``It's baseball knowledge that he signed a contract with Cleveland 
at an appreciably lesser amount than we offered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser is the odd man out in the Indians' starting rotation,  
which includes Charles Nagy, Bartolo Colon, Jaret Wright, Dave 
Burba and Dwight Gooden. In Philadelphia, he could be as high as 
the second starter on a team with paper-thin pitching depth behind 
Schilling. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do feel like under the right circumstances he'd fit in real  
well here,'' Phillies manager Terry Francona said. ``If he doesn't 
come, we'll move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chad Ogea, who couldn't keep a spot in the Indians' rotation for  
four years, is projected as the Phillies' second starter. Paul 
Spoljaric, who has been hit hard this spring, also is counted on to 
win a starting spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Wade said if the Phillies can't sign Hershiser, ``We can  
still put a competent rotation together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillies pro scout Del Unser has seen all three of Hershiser's  
outings this spring. On Monday, he'll go to Haines City to watch 
him pitch a minor league game. 
</P>
<P>
	Hershiser made $3.7 million, including bonuses, last year with  
the Giants. He was 11-10 with a 4.41 ERA, pitching 202 innings.

<HEADLINE> Unser, Hattori Injured at Miami GP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOMESTEAD, Fla. (AP) -- Al Unser Jr. and rookie Naoki Hattori  
broke their legs Sunday when they crashed into each other during 
the first lap of CART's season-opening Marlboro Grand Prix of 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Unser, the former CART series champion, broke his right ankle  
and Hattori suffered a compound fracture of his left leg when they 
hit the wall between the first and second turns at Homestead-Miami 
Speedway. Both drivers were airlifted to a Miami hospital and 
require surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Unser, second on the all-time CART list with 31 race wins, also  
suffered ligament damage to his left knee. He was to be transferred 
Sunday night to Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis and will undergo 
surgery Monday by Dr. Terry Trammell. 
</P>
<P>
	Hattori, a 32-year-old rookie from Japan, was scheduled for  
surgery Sunday night by Dr. James Hutson at Jackson Memorial 
Hospital in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident took place seconds after the green flag as Unser  
apparently got pinched by Hattori's intended high line. The 
resulting contact sent both into the wall, bringing out a caution 
flag that lasted 17 laps. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Steve Olvey, CART's director of medical services, said both  
drivers were awake and alert immediately after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash was another blow for Unser, who was trying to end a  
three-year winless streak while coping with the sudden paralysis of 
his 12-year-old daughter Cody. 
</P>
<P>
	Unser was called away from testing at Homestead last month when  
Cody was diagnosed with a virus that attacks the spinal cord. She 
left a basketball game complaining of numbness in her legs. She is 
paralyzed from the waist down and learning to walk again at a 
Phoenix neurological hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it rains, it pours,'' said Michael Andretti, Unser's  
longtime rival who finished second Sunday. ``I feel bad about Cody, 
and now this happens. It's been a tough winter for him. But they're 
tough people. They'll get through it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also was a bad start to the scaled-back effort of Marlboro  
Team Penske. After just three wins in the past three seasons, owner 
Roger Penske decided to field a one-car entry for the first time 
since 1970, with Unser as his driver.

	Balloonists End World Trip

	MUT, Egypt (AP) -- Less than a day after conquering one of the  
great challenges in aviation, the two men who became the first to 
circle the world nonstop in a hot-air balloon landed safely today 
outside of the Western Desert oasis town of Mut. Bertrand Piccard 
and Brian Jones chose to continue their flight past the finish line 
in the hope of landing near the pyramids, but unfavorable winds 
kept them south of their goal. And then they waited -- for nearly 
eight hours -- atop the steep plateau. Two Egyptian army helicopters 
finally picked up the men.

straight day today, setting houses ablaze as terrified ethnic 
Albanian civilians fled into the snowy hills. Journalists reported 
seeing smoke rising from villages near the town of Srbrica. Earlier 
the Serbian Media Center reported Kosovo Liberation Army rebels 
fired on a police vehicle near the town, with no casualties. The 
rebel Kosova Press Agency claims up to 15,000 civilians were on the

	Israeli Court Rejects Extradition

request today to hear an appeal of a decision not to extradite an 
18-year-old Maryland youth to the United States to face a murder 
charge. In a decision that raised U.S.-Israel tensions, Israel's 
Supreme Court last month ruled that Samuel Sheinbein, who was born 
and raised in the United States, was an Israeli citizen and could 
not be extradited. Sheinbein fled to Israel three days after the 
burned and mutilated corpse of Alfredo Enrique Tello Jr., 19, was 
found in Montgomery County, Md., in September of 1997. A prosecutor 
will issue charges against Sheinbein tomorrow in Tel Aviv district 
court and his trial on the death will be held in Israel.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and daughter  
Chelsea's 12-day trip to North Africa got off to a rocky start 
yesterday, including an engine fire. The planned departure from 
Andrews Air Force Base in suburban Maryland was delayed an hour 
because the Air Force Boeing 707 jetliner carrying the president's 
wife and daughter, staff aides and journalists was found to be 
overweight with cargo and luggage. Then as the plane raced down the 
runway for takeoff, flames shot out the rear of the outboard engine

	Prostitution Ring Preyed on Young

ring whose ringleader allegedly lured young, troubled girls to the 
city with promises of sympathy, money and dancing jobs. James 
Coleman, 39, has been arraigned on charges of transporting minors 
across state lines for prostitution and sex. Girls told 
investigators they left troubled homes after Coleman promised them 
money and jobs in Detroit. Once there, promises were replaced with 
10- to 12-hour shifts as prostitutes in motels or as call girls in 
the Detroit area, according to the affidavit. Coleman employed as 
many as 20 girls at a time, investigators say.

end of a 10-0 count when McEachern beat Grant Fuhr on an odd-man

Championships, and he says he's done with Davis Cup. Hampered by an 
inconsistent serve and sore hamstring, Agassi lost his opening 
match yesterday to fist-pumping Slovakian Dominik Hrbaty, 1-6, 6-3, 
6-2. Agassi, ranked ninth, has yet to reach a final or beat a 
top-20 player this year, so the loss wasn't as big a surprise as 
what came next: His pledge to quit Davis Cup.

<HEADLINE> Benigni Wins Oscar as Best Actor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Roberto Benigni, who portrayed a father  
shielding his son from the horrors of the Holocaust in the 
tragi-comic ``Life is Beautiful'' became the first star of a 
foreign language film to win the Oscar for best actor Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie, which Benigni also wrote and directed, won additional  
Academy Awards for foreign film and dramatic score. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a terrible mistake because I used up all my English,''  
he said, as he leapt to the stage for the second time. 
</P>
<P>
	Judi Dench, who played the imperious but fair-minded Queen  
Elizabeth I in ``Shakespeare in Love,'' and James Coburn, the 
alcoholic, abusive father in ``Affliction,'' won best supporting 
Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saving Private Ryan,'' Steven Spielberg's bloody depiction of  
World War II combat which figured to be ``Shakespeare's'' big 
competition for the major awards, took prizes for editing, sound

	About two-thirds of the way through the show ``Private Ryan,''  
``Shakespeare,'' and ``Life Is Beautiful'' had three apiece. After 
last year's 11-Oscar blowout by ``Titanic,'' the movie crowd seemed 
to welcome a real race this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Benigni, the only performer in a foreign language film  
to win an Oscar was Sophia Loren for ``Two Women'' in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	Fittingly, it was Miss Loren who presented him with his first  
award of the night. The perpetually ebullient Benigni clambered 
over the backs of seats and hopped onto the stage after Loren 
openly rooted for her fellow Italian and announced his foreign film 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to kiss everybody,'' said Benigni, who also was  
nominated in directing and screenplay categories, while the film 
was a best picture contender.

<HEADLINE> Coburn Wins Oscar for 'Affliction' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- James Coburn's performance in ``Affliction''  
as a cop's abusive father contrasts with the more glamorous tough 
guys he played in movies such as ``The Great Escape'' and ``The 
Magnificent Seven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coburn, who won the award as best supporting actor Sunday night,  
had made more than 80 movies but had never been nominated for an 
Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
	``Affliction,'' based on the acclaimed novel by Russell Banks,  
deals with depression and drunkenness and the relationships between 
a self-destructive lawman and his family in a small New England 
town. 
</P>
<P>
	He played Glen Whitehouse, the abusive father to the character  
played by Nick Nolte, who was nominated for best actor. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	--From the podium: ``I've been working and doing this work for,  
like, over half my life and I finally got one right I guess,'' the 
bearded, silver-haired Coburn growled with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
	--Some previous films: ``Our Man Flint,'' ``In Like Flint,''  
``The Magnificent Seven,'' ``The Great Escape,'' ``The Muppet 
Movie,'' ``Young Guns,'' ``Hudson Hawk,'' ``Maverick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Breaking in: The son of an auto mechanic came to Hollywood and  
studied acting as Los Angeles City College and the University of 
Southern California before landing a gunslinger role in the 1959 
movie ``Ride Lonesome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Breakthrough role: The 1966 spy spoof ``Our Man Flint.''  
</P>
<P>
	--Bio: Age 70, born in Laurel, Neb.

<HEADLINE> Middle-Aged Hurt by Taiwan Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan's faltering economy is producing  
the greatest hardships for those least equipped to deal with new 
economic realities -- the middle-aged, less educated, and less 
skilled, an opposition politician said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost half of respondents to a recent survey said their incomes  
shrunk in 1998 compared to 1997, and about 43 percent said they 
feared losing their jobs, said Chou Ya-shu, a member of the 
Legislature from the Democratic Progressive Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Those more than 40 years old with only an elementary or middle  
school education suffered the deepest cuts in their incomes, and 
were least able to find economic alternatives, Chou said. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, commissioned by a think tank connected to the main  
opposition party, sampled 1,071 adults on Feb. 23-26. It did not 
provide a sample of error. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan's relatively strong economy has shielded it from the  
devastating rises in unemployment and poverty suffered by neighbors 
such as South Korea and Thailand that have been hit worst by the 
Asian economic downturn. But a series of high-profile business 
failures have staggered confidence, and retailers are beginning to 
complain of reduced consumer buying power. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest fall in exports in 43 years caused economic growth  
to slow to 4.83 percent last year, down from the 1997 rate of 6.8 
percent, Exports plunged 9.4 percent last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Growth is expected to slow still more this year, with the  
government predicting a rate of 4.74 percent, the lowest since 
Taiwan was hit by an oil crisis in 1982.

	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Roy Lassiter had two goals and Carlos Llamosa  
and Jaime Moreno scored four minutes apart early in the second half 
as D.C. United beat Tampa Bay 5-2 in a Major League Soccer opener 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Lassiter, traded from Tampa Bay to D.C. United last season, made  
it 3-0 in the 66th minute and added his second goal in the 86th 
minute. He has 20 goals in 26 games with United. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a real good feeling before the game,'' D.C. United coach  
Thomas Rongen said. ``The core of our players have been together 
and they were ready to play. There was a lot of emotion in he 
lockeroom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Llamosa's header following a corner kick by Marco Etcheverry in  
the 50th minute made it 1-0 and Moreno made it 2-0 in the 54th 
minute from point-blank range after Ben Olsen's feed. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson Gottardi scored Tampa Bay's goals in the 67th and 88th  
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed and angry because from my standpoint for what  
I feel our team was capable of, we didn't play,'' Mutiny coach Tim 
Hankinson said. ``On the most exciting day of the year, our guys 
did not give us their fight.''

<HEADLINE> Pineaff Wins Tampa Bay Derby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OLDSMAR, Fla. (AP) -- Pineaff rallied from more than 13 lengths  
back at the half-mile pole to edge fellow Kentucky Derby contender 
Menifee in the $150,000 Tampa Bay Derby on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee, a 2-5 favorite, lost for the first time in four career  
starts and prevented Pat Day from becoming the first jockey to ride 
two winners in the 19-year history of the event. 
</P>
<P>
	Day rode Parade Ground to victory in the 1998 Tampa Bay Derby.  
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't expect to get beat today, but we didn't expect to be  
undefeated our whole life either,'' said Elliott Walden, Menifee's 
trainer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he ran a credible race. If he had gotten beat by  
five lengths and stopped in the lane, I would have been really 
disappointed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pineaff, ridden by Jose Santos, completed the mile and one-  
sixteenth at Tampa Bay Downs in 1:45.33 on a track made dull by 
morning rain. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kentucky-bred colt, a 6-1 shot in the six-horse field, paid  
$14, $3.60 and $2.10 after edging Menifee by a length and Doneraile 
Court by five. 
</P>
<P>
	``When our horse acted up in the paddock, I knew he would win,''  
Pineaff's owner Roy Monroe said. ``I was surprised. He never did 
this before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the loss, Day was satisfied with his bay colt's first  
effort at this distance. 
</P>
<P>
	``My opinion of this horse hasn't diminished,'' Day said. ``It's  
the first time he was really tested, the first time around two 
turns on a tiring race track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Day floated wide around both turns, then rallied to take a brief  
lead down the stretch. Pineaff moved from the inside on the second 
turn, then followed Menifee to the outside for the winning charge 
in the final sixteenth. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Pineaff and Menifee are expected to run in the Blue Grass  
Stakes at Keeneland on April 10.

<HEADLINE> Steve Alford Eyes Iowa Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- Southwest Missouri State basketball  
coach Steve Alford says he has been interviewed by Iowa and is 
interested in coaching the Hawkeyes next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa athletic director Bob Bowlsby said last April that coach  
Tom Davis' contract would not be extended past this season, his 
13th at Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Davis and Alford coached their teams to two victories in  
the NCAA tournament before dropping regional semifinal contests. 
</P>
<P>
	Alford told reporters he is ``99 percent'' sure he will coach at  
Iowa or Southwest Missouri State next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Alford said he has not officially been offered the Iowa job, but  
said he has several questions and plans to speak again soon with 
Bowlsby. 
</P>
<P>
	``Within the next 72 hours, there have to be a lot of decisions  
made,'' said Alford, whose Bears lost 78-61 Friday to top-ranked 
Duke while Iowa was eliminated from the tourney the night before 
with a 78-68 loss to Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish the timing was such that a decision wouldn't have to be  
made right away because there's not a lot of time to cherish what 
happened with this team,'' said the 34-year-old Alford, who has a 
78-48 record in four years at Southwest Missouri State. 
</P>
<P>
	About 300 people greeted the team's charter flight on its  
arrival at Springfield-Branson Regional Airport on Saturday night. 
One fan carried a sign that said, ``Steve Must Stay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alford, a collegiate standout at Indiana, called Iowa ``one of  
only four or five programs in the country I would consider leaving 
SMS for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the financial package at Iowa would double his current  
income at Southwest Missouri State, which has been estimated at 
about $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Business is only one part of it,'' Alford said. ``Whatever  
happens has to be right for me personally and right for my 
family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alford said he has not told his team whether he intends to stay  
or leave for Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Southwest Missouri State president John Keiser said Friday the  
school was ``glad to have had him and we hope we can keep him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But if not, we thank him for giving us a program that will be  
attractive enough to get another good coach,'' Keiser said.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Wins Rome Marathon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Philip Tanui was supposed to set the pace Sunday and  
help fellow Kenyan Philip Chirchir win the Rome Marathon. But Tanui 
discarded that plan and pulled away to win his first title over the 
26-mile, 385-yard distance. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanui, who trains with Chirchir in Brescia, Italy, helped  
Chirchir until there were about 5 miles left, then broke away. He 
crossed the finish line alone in the shade of the Colosseum. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanui's time was 2 hours, 9 minutes, 56 seconds.  
</P>
<P>
	Dmitri Kapitanov of Russia surged into second place down the  
stretch and finished at 2:10:10. Chirchir was third, another five 
seconds back. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's Maura Viceconte, third at last year's European  
championships, was the women's winner, at 2:29:36. She took the 
lead at about the halfway mark and was never challenged. 
</P>
<P>
	Jane Salumae of Estonia was second at 2:30:40.  
</P>
<P>
	The 5,000 entrants wound through the streets and squares of the  
city, including past the Spanish Steps, Piazza Navona and the 
Circus Maximus in the historic center. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Franceso Rutelli, who participated in the race's 3.1-mile  
event Sunday, said the next Rome Marathon will be run Jan. 1, 2000, 
with the course starting and finishing at St. Peter's Square.

<HEADLINE> Bull Market Mixes Fact and Fancy / Ticker Talk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Now that the Dow Jones industrial average has  
broken 10,000, it's more tempting than ever to regard the great 
bull market in stocks as a flight of fantasy, something utterly 
unreal. 
</P>
<P>
	How can the assets and earning power of corporate America be  
worth twice as much today as they were just 3 1/2 years ago, when the 
Dow crossed 5,000 for the first time in the fall of 1995? Or three 
times as much as their market value seven years ago, when the 
average hovered around 3,300 in the early spring of 1992? 
</P>
<P>
	That's not even to mention the wacky world of Internet stocks,  
where traders seemingly never let mundane worries like ``will this 
business ever make a profit?'' spoil a good story. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are outright gamblers,'' says Ray DeVoe, an analyst at  
Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc., ``riding a lucky streak and hopefully 
getting off before the plug is pulled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As they survey the whole bull-market scene on Wall Street, many  
observers seek to explain it by looking at the supply and demand 
forces that drive the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks are up, they conclude, because the huge generation of  
baby boomers born after World War II is rushing to invest, almost 
in a panic, before its 72 million members start reaching retirement 
age. 
</P>
<P>
	In this view, once the bull market got rolling it gathered a  
self-propelling momentum that attracted more and more investors. 
Now, the skeptics say, it looks as though nothing will stop the 
bandwagon until something ugly happens and the wheels come off. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost everybody in the financial world shares these concerns to  
some extent. By any known standard, prices of many technology 
stocks and a few dozen blue chips are extraordinarily high. 
</P>
<P>
	But optimistic analysts say that doesn't make the whole bull  
market a fraud, or the result of some artificial increase in demand 
for stocks. They say the primary explanation for rising stock 
prices lies in powerful economic progress, marked by surging 
productivity and sharply reduced inflation that have helped many 
businesses prosper and grow. 
</P>
<P>
	``We break with the consensus in our view of the baby-boomer  
inflows into the stock market,'' says Richard Hoey, chief economist 
at the Dreyfus Corp. ``Rather than the demographics being the cause 
of the stock bull market, both the public inflows into stocks and 
the bull market are the effects of favorable fundamentals. 
</P>
<P>
	``These favorable fundamentals include the decline in inflation  
and interest rates, the shift to budget surpluses and the superior 
capital efficiency in the U.S.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If an aging population concerned about retirement had the power  
to cause a bull market by itself, Hoey adds, Japan also should have 
had one over the past decade, instead of the severe bear market it 
has suffered through. 
</P>
<P>
	As analysts debate what is real and what isn't in the bull  
market, most all of them agree on one point -- the ``battle of Dow 
10,000'' does not qualify as an actual event. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest reading of the Dow is calculated at any time by  
adding up the prices of its 30 component stocks, and then dividing 
by a divisor that is regularly adjusted for stock splits and other 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
	It just happens to be around 10,000 now because of a long series  
of decisions, many of them arbitrary, made in years past by the 
people at Dow Jones &AMP; Co. who designed and oversee the average. 
</P>
<P>
	If different stocks had been added to the average over the  
years, or some of the same ones now included in it had been 
introduced at different times, Dow 10,000 might be an old story, or 
a still-distant vision, by now.

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices Soar About 8 1/2 Cents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) -- Gasoline prices experienced their  
biggest jump in nearly a decade, rising about 8 1/2 cents per gallon 
at the pump over the past two weeks as global changes reduced a 
supply glut, an analyst said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase was only the second since September and followed a  
half-cent hike recorded two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The weighted average, including all grades and taxes, was  
$1.0869 cents per gallon on Friday, up 8.41 cents from two weeks 
earlier, according to the Lundberg Survey of 10,000 gas stations 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The sharpest increase, averaging 14 cents, was in the Midwest.  
The smallest, at a nickel, was in the West, which prices had jumped 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can barely make things as it is,'' said Maria Amador, an  
office manager, as she filled her Plymouth Voyager van at a 
downtown Los Angeles gas station. ``If gas goes up, I'll have to 
decrease my driving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rising crude oil prices were to blame, and the causes for that  
are complex, involving global politics and local disasters, analyst 
Trilby Lundberg said from Texas, where she is attending a refiners' 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	They include OPEC's announcement that it plans to cut oil  
production by 2 million barrels a day and the Feb. 23 explosion at 
a Tosco Corp. oil refinery in Martinez, Calif. that killed four 
people and sent gasoline buyers chasing alternative supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Other reasons range from disruption of Iraq's oil pipeline by  
U.S. air raids to greater demand thanks to an improving world 
economy, Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	The glut that sent prices plunging to a 12-year low also played  
a role by causing a shakeout among small producers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The industry is writhing in pain,'' Lundberg said. ``There are  
substantial casualties in the oil patch, especially small 
independents in the U.S.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lundberg said the price hike is the largest and fastest jump  
since the 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Even so, she noted, prices are 
only a penny above last year's and remain nearly 24 cents under the 
$1.33 figure recorded when the price crash began in September 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Self-service prices were $1.0284 per gallon for regular,  
$1.13.39 for mid-grade and $1.2191 for premium. 
</P>
<P>
	Full-service prices were $1.4361 for regular, $1.5276 for  
mid-grade and $1.6013 for premium.

<HEADLINE> Single Empire Wins San Luis Rey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Single Empire went four-wide into the  
stretch and staved off Kessem Power by a nose to win Sunday's 
$250,000 San Luis Rey Stakes at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
	Kent Desormeaux, riding his third winner on the card, guided  
Single Empire over 1 1/2 miles on the turf in 2:27 4-5. The Irish-bred 
winner paid $11.20, $5.40 and $4.20 in his second start in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Boy, when my horse got his legs underneath him and set sail  
for the target, he put on a kick like the race was only 
three-quarters of a mile. It was close, but I knew we had won,'' 
Desormeaux said. 
</P>
<P>
	New Zealand-bred Kessem Power, who won the San Luis Rey last  
year, returned $4.40 and $2.80, while Brazilian-bred Alvo Certo was 
another 1 3-4 lengths back in third and paid $4 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	``I probably would have done better if I got a little traffic,  
and, when I needed it most, I didn't get it,'' said Michael Kinane, 
Kessem Power's jockey. ``But when I went for the run, I had to take 
it. Otherwise, it was going to close down. He really quickened, but 
you could see he went to idling a little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The victory, worth $150,000, increased Single Empire's career  
earnings to $554,113, with four wins in 10 starts.

<HEADLINE> Sara Lee Meat Plant Being Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZEELAND, Mich. (AP) -- The Sara Lee Corp. meat processing plant  
connected to a deadly outbreak of Listeria bacteria is under 
investigation by a federal grand jury, a company spokeswoman said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Lee spokeswoman Theresa Herlevsen said the U.S. attorney's  
office in Grand Rapids is investigating Bil Mar Foods in Zeeland. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not something that's unusual in light of the  
circumstances,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hot dogs and other packaged meat from the Bil Mar plant have  
been linked to 15 deaths, six miscarriages and stillbirths and 
about 100 illnesses in 22 states, according to the federal Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	Herlevsen said the Chicago-based Sara Lee is cooperating with  
the grand jury and conducting its own investigation.

<HEADLINE> Academy Honors Filmmaker Jewison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Norman Jewison's 36-year producing and  
directing career brought him the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award, 
bestowed by the Academy for exemplary moviemaking. 
</P>
<P>
	His films have earned 41 nominations and 12 Academy Awards,  
including Best Picture for 1967's ``In the Heat of the Night.'' His 
four other bids in that category: ``The Russians Are Coming, the 
Russians Are Coming'' (1966), ``Fiddler on the Roof'' (1971), ``A 
Soldier's Story'' (1984) and ``Moonstruck,'' (1987). 
</P>
<P>
	He danced onstage Sunday to the strains of ``If I Were A Rich  
Man,'' from ``Fiddler'' and accepted his lifetime achievement award 
from presenter Nicolas Cage. 
</P>
<P>
	He thanked everyone he had ever worked with, and praised the art  
of brevity. 
</P>
<P>
	His parting advice to young filmmakers: ``Just find some good  
stories. Never mind the gross, the top 10, the bottom 10, what's 
the rating, what's the demographic,'' he said to loud applause. 
</P>
<P>
	``So just tell a story that moves us to laughter and tears, and  
perhaps reveals a little truth about ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His movies were marked by struggle and nonconformity -- ``In the  
Heat of the Night, when Sidney Poitier's inner-city detective 
fights Southern racism, to ``Moonstruck,'' when Cher defies family 
convention for a younger man. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Toronto, Jewison's entertainment career began in London  
as an actor and writer for the BBC. In the 1950s, he returned home 
to direct television shows, eventually moving to New York, where he 
directed musical-variety shows for the Canadian Broadcasting Co. 
featuring Judy Garland, Frank Sinatra and Harry Belafonte. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1963, he directed his first film, ``Forty Pounds of  
Trouble,'' a comedy starring Tony Curtis and Suzanne Pleshette. In 
1965, ``The Cincinnati Kid,'' starring a young Steve McQueen, 
established Jewison's entry into serious filmmaking. 
</P>
<P>
	Jewison also served as producer and director on ``The Thomas  
Crown Affair'' (1968), ``Jesus Christ Superstar (1973), ``Agnes of 
God'' (1985), and ``In Country'' (1989).

<HEADLINE> Soccer Head May Seek Bribe Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Lennart Johansson, president of European soccer's  
governing body, is reported to have asked for an investigation into 
a claim that 20 officials were bribed to ensure that Sepp Blatter 
beat him in last year's election for FIFA president. 
</P>
<P>
	The bribes, amounting to a million dollars, came from the leader  
of a Middle Eastern state, according to the Observer. 
</P>
<P>
	The claim is made ``How They Stole the Game,'' a book by British  
author David Yallop. FIFA, soccer's international governing body, 
obtained an injunction last fall blocking the sale of the book in 
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	A Dutch court last week refused to grant a similar injunction  
preventing publication in the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Johansson asked FIFA to look into the claim made in the book,  
according to the Observer. 
</P>
<P>
	Johansson, who was a strong favorite to win the FIFA election  
until Blatter entered the contest, was dismayed that 20 FIFA 
members, notably from African countries, changed their allegiances 
in the last few weeks before the election in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The book said $1 million in cash was flown by the Middle Eastern  
figure, who was not identified, to the Meridien Hotel in Paris and 
given to the 20 FIFA delegates before the election. 
</P>
<P>
	Reacting to the fact that Blatter was objecting to the book's  
publication, Johansson reportedly said: ``I have reasons to ask 
myself 'why should (FIFA) be against it?' I think that Blatter 
should have an inquiry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blatter was quoted as saying there was no need for an  
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I cannot open an inquiry into myself. The elections are now  
finished,'' he told the newspaper

<HEADLINE> Laws Increase After School Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JONESBORO, Ark. (AP) -- A year after two heavily armed boys  
pulled a fire alarm and shot students filing out of Westside Middle 
School, killing four girls and a teacher, the superintendent talks 
about keeping a ``cloak of safety'' around his 75-acre campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Shrubs are cut back and a wooden fence now sets off the campus.  
A uniformed officer teaches Arkansas criminal law and acts as 
student confidante. School counselors are on duty every day. 
</P>
<P>
	The district is functioning normally, says Superintendent Dick  
Young, though it doesn't use alarms for fire drills anymore. He 
won't allow visitors in the hallways, saying children may be 
reminded what happened March 24, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in that gulf between wanting to remember and wanting to  
forget,'' Young says. 
</P>
<P>
	Students Natalie Brooks, Paige Ann Herring, Stephanie Johnson  
and Britthney Varner and teacher Shannon Wright were cut down in 
the brief outburst of gunfire. A memorial garden is being built at 
the spot where they fell. 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings in Jonesboro and at schools in Pearl, Miss.; West  
Paducah, Ky.; Edinboro, Pa.; Fayetteville, Tenn.; Springfield, 
Ore.; and Richmond, Va., alarmed the nation last year. President 
Clinton called the outbreak ``a terrible tragedy'' and noted ``the 
awful specter of students being killed by other young people at 
schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Stephens of the California-based National School Safety  
Center told a House subcommittee after the Jonesboro shootings: 
``It should not require an act of courage for parents to send their 
children to school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the first anniversary of the Jonesboro shootings,  
Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., plans to introduce for a second time 
the Children's Gun Violence Prevention Act. The legislation never 
came to a vote last year. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarthy says the bill would help prosecute people who sell guns  
to children, require gun owners to keep guns away from children and 
finance violence awareness programs in schools. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, Richard Durbin, D-Ill., and John Chafee, R-R.I.,  
will make another run at the Child Access Prevention bill. The bill 
holds adults liable when children use improperly stored firearms to 
kill or injure others. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephens says some 20 states have laws calling for school safety  
plans and many have set up hot lines for anonymous tips on 
disturbing behavior by students, tightened access to campuses and 
improved screening for school visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my view, the schools are safer than they were a year ago  
because we've had a heightened need to be vigilant,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzann Wilson, who lost her 11-year-old daughter, Britthney,  
knows of the changes at Westside but says more should be done to 
make students feel safe. Class sizes should be smaller, students 
should be taught how to deal with their anger and schools should 
have more counselors. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson says her 14-year-old daughter, Brandi, is still afraid to  
go to school. And for Wilson's part, ``there's not a day goes by 
that I don't think that she's going back to where her sister got 
killed,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	In Mississippi, where Pearl High School student Luke Woodham was  
convicted of killing two classmates and wounding seven others after 
first killing his mother Oct. 1, 1997, the Legislature passed a law 
broadening the death penalty to include killings on school 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kentucky, student Michael Carneal received a life sentence  
after pleading guilty but mentally ill in the shooting deaths of 
three students at Heath High School near Paducah on Dec. 1, 1997. 
McCracken County School District, home to Heath High, now posts 
armed security guards, requires student identification tags and 
searches for weapons in its schools. In Lexington, Ashland and 
other places, anonymous tip lines were set up to report guns or 
drugs brought to schools. 
</P>
<P>
	In Virginia, where 14-year-old Quinshawn Booker wounded a  
teacher and a 74-year-old school volunteer last June 15, Gov. Jim 
Gilmore has released $1.5 million to put some 45 additional police 
officers in schools. Richmond schools ordered teachers to step up 
hallway patrols, and some school districts installed surveillance 
cameras. Booker pleaded guilty to five counts and was required to 
complete a program at a school for troubled youths, then be on 
probation until age 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson has forcefully lobbied the Arkansas Legislature to hold  
gun owners liable if they leave unlocked guns where children can 
get them. She also wants to prohibit juveniles from owning guns 
after their release from detention centers. 
</P>
<P>
	A heated exchange with gun advocates on the state Capitol steps  
Feb. 1 brought Wilson to tears. But the confrontation did not 
diminish her resolve. 
</P>
<P>
	``It keeps me directed,'' Wilson says. ``It's something to focus  
on. If I didn't have this, then I would have to stop and think 
about what I lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Arkansas legislators debated her proposals and other  
measures, Andrew Golden, 12, and Mitchell Johnson, 14, remained in 
custody at a juvenile prison 20 minutes away. The boys, 11 and 13 
at the time of the shootings, were found delinquent in the five 
killings and the wounding of 10 others. They are due to be released 
at age 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really have not had any major problems with either boy.  
They have not been difficult juveniles for us,'' says Joe Quinn, 
spokesman for the Human Services Department, which oversees 
juvenile corrections. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonesboro is marking the sad anniversary with two gatherings at  
12:40 p.m., the time of the shootings-- one at the school, the 
second at the courthouse. Wilson says Brandi will sing at the 
courthouse, and afterward the family will visit the cemetery where 
Britthney is buried.

<HEADLINE>  Iowa Wins Wrestling Title, Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- Once again, it's Iowa.  
</P>
<P>
	The Hawkeyes -- who looked vulnerable after losing four dual  
meets and their first Big Ten Tournament in a quarter-century -- won 
the NCAA Division I wrestling championships Saturday, 100 1/2-98 1/2 over 
Minnesota in the first tournament to be decided by the final match 
in more than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa's second-year coach Jim Zalesky called this title more  
satisfying than last year's. 
</P>
<P>
	``With this group, it's sweeter because nobody expected it,'' he  
said. ``Last year, we had the horses to win it, everyone knew we 
had the horses. We had guys who'd been here. This year, we only had 
one guy who'd been here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa's fifth straight national title -- its eighth in the past  
nine years -- came down to the heavyweight final, the most 
anticipated showdown of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Neal, Cal State-Bakersfield's heavyweight and the  
defending champion, won his 83rd straight match 3-2 against 
Minnesota's Brock Lesnar to the cheers of the Hawkeyes faithful. 
</P>
<P>
	``I waited for him to make a mistake,'' Neal said. ``He made one  
and I made none.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm amazed,'' Lesnar said afterward. ``I just -- I gave all I  
had and I'm just really disappointed. I wrestled 110 percent and I 
wouldn't ask more of myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Golden Gophers -- who have never won a national title, but  
beat the Hawkeyes in the Big Ten Tournament this month -- started 
the finals two points ahead of Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Hawkeyes had two finalists win: Doug Schwab at 141, beat  
Michael Lightner of Oklahoma 4-2 on a takedown with 18 seconds 
left; and T.J. Williams at 149, improved to 40-0 with a 5-3 win 
against Mount Carmel (Ill.) High School teammate Tony Davis of 
Northern Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're in the national finals, that's enough in itself,''  
Schwab said. ``The team title, putting us back in the lead, that's 
extra incentive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zalesky said his team peaked at the right time.  
</P>
<P>
	``I had some concerns in the middle part of the season,'' he  
said. ``That's why I didn't try to get them emotionally high until 
the last two weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those early victories by Schwab and Williams turned the tide for  
Iowa and put pressure on Minnesota's three finalists. Only one 
Gopher won a final. 
</P>
<P>
	``Couple of our guys didn't wrestle up to their seeds and Iowa's  
did,'' said Minnesota coach J Robinson. He had thought the Gophers 
could win it with Lesnar. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neal took one shot. That's how close it was,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	To set up the tournament-deciding heavyweight match, Minnesota's  
Tim Hartung at 197, the 1998 champion, pulled out a dramatic 2-1 
victory against 1997 champ Lee Fullhart. Hartung finished his 
season 39-0 and won the last 55 matches of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartung took Fullhart down with 34 seconds left to finish his  
career 9-1 against the Iowa wrestler. Fullhart nearly reversed 
Hartung in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota's Brandon Eggum was the second of Minnesota's three  
finalists to lose, 6-1 to Iowa State's Cael Sanderson (39-0). 
Sanderson, a redshirt freshman, was named the tournament's most 
outstanding wrestler. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma State -- No. 1 coming into the nationals with two  
defending champs, another No. 1 seed and a No. 2 seed -- finished 
third with 84 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys sent only one wrestler into the finals, Eric  
Guerrero, who won his third national title at 133 by taking down 
Iowa State's Cody Sanderson 55 seconds into overtime for a 3-1 
victory. He is the 13th three-time champion at Oklahoma State. 
</P>
<P>
	``To accomplish a little of what they've accomplished in their  
lives, it's an unbelievable feeling. It probably won't hit me until 
I'm 60 years old,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of Penn State's three finalists, only Glenn Pritzlaff at 174  
won, 10-4 against Otto Olson of Michigan. Unbeaten Jeremy Hunter at 
125 lost 7-4 to Stephen Abas of Fresno State. Clint Musser at 157 
lost to Casey Cunningham of Central Michigan, 2-1. Cunningham is 
Central Michigan's first national champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk White, No. 2 at 165, became Boise State's first national  
champion by beating Rodney Jones of Oklahoma 3-1 despite suffering 
a pinched neck nerve and numbness during parts of the last two 
matches. 
</P>
<P>
	Teammate Larry Quisel placed third at 157 after being upset in  
his first match, which included a controversial timekeeping call. 
He had to win eight straight matches, including five seeded 
wrestlers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great accomplishment to be the first one. I'm not going  
to be the last one,'' White said.

<HEADLINE> Ohio St. Backcourt Sparks Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Despite all of his individual success,  
guard Michael Redd remembers his miserable freshman season at Ohio 
State. It was just last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, after Redd got some help in the backcourt, the Buckeyes are  
going to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	``We suffered so much last year. The hurt ... we were crying  
after every game, wondering when will it get better,'' said Redd, 
who was unable to take solace in leading the Buckeyes in scoring, 
rebounding and steals in his first season. 
</P>
<P>
	But things got better in a hurry after Scoonie Penn, a transfer  
who followed coach Jim O'Brien from Boston College, joined Redd in 
the backcourt this season. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the biggest turnarounds ever, Ohio State (27-8) has  
gone from the bottom of the Big Ten standings a year ago (8-22, 
1-15 Big Ten) and five straight losing seasons to the pinnacle of 
college basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes beat St. John's 77-74 in the NCAA South Regional  
final Saturday night, never trailing after Redd's fastbreak dunk 
that provided the game's first points. 
</P>
<P>
	``For this season to happen like it has, it feels so wonderful  
for us to be on the top instead of being on the bottom for so 
long,'' said Redd, who grew up in Columbus near the Ohio State 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Wisconsin, which won only five games the season before  
winning the 1941 NCAA title, won fewer games the year before going 
to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	Redd and Penn, who had to sit out last season because of  
transfer rules, have scored 154 of Ohio State's 296 points in four 
NCAA tournament games. The duo also has combined for 31 assists and 
only 13 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their guards were as good if not better than advertised,'' St.  
John's coach Mike Jarvis said. ``Scoonie Penn and Redd had good 
games and carried their team on their backs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Redd and Penn combined for 42 points, 14 rebounds and 13 assists  
against St. John's (28-9), which fell short after a furious rally 
in the final two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn, the only new starter this season for Ohio State, was the  
South Regional MVP. He scored 22 points with eight rebounds and 
eight assists against St. John's, after a 26-point performance in a 
72-64 semifinal victory over top-seeded Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Storm were down only 76-74 with possession of the ball  
and a timeout with 12.5 seconds left. The plan was for Erick 
Barkley to drive to the basket or attempt to draw a foul, but the 
freshman guard made a crucial mistake while making a move around 
Penn. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no one between me and the basket ... I just lost the  
ball,'' said Barkley, whose only turnover in 37 minutes came at the 
most critical moment of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The loose ball wound up in the hands of Redd, who dribbled down  
the court before being fouled with just seven-tenths of a second 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	The Buckeyes play Connecticut in the Final Four next Saturday at  
St. Petersburg, Fla.

<HEADLINE> Elfman Avoids Trappings of Stardom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With a hit sitcom and a new movie coming out,  
``Dharma &AMP; Greg'' star Jenna Elfman has a few tips for staying sane 
in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do other things,'' Elfman says in the March 18-25 issue of  
Time Out New York magazine. ``I don't just act. It starts to feel 
like you're digging into an open wound when you do the same thing 
all the time. It becomes achy, sore and tiresome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although she co-stars in the upcoming film ``Ed TV,'' Elfman  
feels typecast by her perky character on ``Dharma &AMP; Greg.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I want people to start offering me some big dramatic parts,''  
she said. ``Sometimes people get locked in this spunky girl thing, 
like I do every week. I want the opportunity to do other things, 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elfman, 27, got her start in show business as a dancer,  
appearing on the 1991 Academy Awards show and with the rock group 
ZZ Top on a 1994 concert tour as a ``Legs Girl'' dancing to the 
song ``She's Got Legs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Past credits include appearances on ``Roseanne,'' ``NYPD Blue,''  
``Townies'' and the films ``Grosse Pointe Blank'' and 
``Krippendorf's Tribe.''

<HEADLINE> Rodman Returns and Lakers Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Dennis Rodman returned to the Los Angeles  
Lakers and was his usual defiant self Sunday, refusing to apologize 
for his eccentric lifestyle or his gambling trip to Las Vegas while 
his team was on the road losing three of four games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be here the rest of the season. I've used up my hall  
pass,'' he said, adding that his return got just the kind of 
reaction from his teammates that he expected -- none. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman played 23 minutes Sunday and had four points on 2-for-2  
shooting and grabbed six rebounds to help the Lakers overcome a 
24-point deficit to beat the Orlando Magic 115-104. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman left the Lakers after practice March 13, telling coach  
Kurt Rambis he needed time to resolve personal issues. He missed 
the first four games of a six-game road trip, and the Lakers lost 
three of them after going 9-0 with him in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-time rebounding champion, who has helped teams win  
five NBA championships, insisted the eight-day break had nothing to 
do with drinking, gambling, smoking or marital problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``This game ain't worth that much for me to lose who I am,''  
Rodman said, adding that he was fined $100 a day by the Lakers. ``I 
had to get away because I really didn't know if I wanted to play 
basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, he said, it was wife Carmen Electra who helped convince  
him to return to work after spending part of the layoff in Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he had resolved the matters that left him pondering  
retirement, Rodman smiled. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing's ever ironed out. They just kind of subside for a  
while,'' he said. Of his decision to spend part of the time 
gambling in Las Vegas, he said: ``I'm different. I do it my way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He did not apologize -- publicly, or to his teammates.  
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't need to do that. I won't do that,'' Rodman said.  
``Like said, action speaks louder than words. I came back ... 
People have to understand this is me. Just let me do what I've got 
to do and everything will be all right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 13th-year pro's teammates were supportive.  
</P>
<P>
	``He had personal problems and our organization was gracious  
enough to let him go to Vegas and do some gambling and clear his 
head, whatever,'' Shaquille O'Neal said. ``But he's back. We all 
said what we had to say to him. Hopefully, he doesn't do that 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You can grab a stat sheet, and what he brings won't show up,''  
teammate Derek Harper said. ``But his energy and his knowledge of 
the game, his defensive ability, his rebounding ability, it helps 
our basketball team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman said he arrived in town at about 3 a.m. and accompanied  
the team to Orlando Arena where he spoke briefly with coach Kurt 
Rambis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just asked him if he was all right,'' Rambis said. ``He said  
he was all right, and that was it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if Rodman assured him he will not leave the team  
again, the coach said: ``I don't think anybody can make those 
assurances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rambis became coach on Feb. 26, the same day Rodman first played  
for the Lakers. Rambis declined to speculate on what might happen 
if seven-time rebounding champion leaves the team again. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have to cross that bridge if and when it happens,''  
Rambis said. ``I'm not going to sit here with hard and fast rules 
to what happens in future situations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was suggested to Rambis that the Lakers, particularly under  
former coach Pat Riley, would not have tolerated such behavior when 
Rambis was part of teams led by Magic Johnson and Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see why it couldn't have happened,'' Rambis said. ``I  
mean if somebody has some personal issues that they have to deal 
with. You can't sit there and write and tell me that if Kareem had 
come to Riley and said, `I've got some personal issues I want to 
deal with. I want to be excused for the next two weeks,' that 
Riley's going to say: `That's it, you're waived, get out of here.' 
I would have a hard time seeing that happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 10 games, Rodman has averaged 2.1 points and 9.9 rebounds and  
the Lakers outrebounded opponents seven times. The team was 
outrebounded in each of the first four games on the road trip, but 
compiled a 38-34 edge Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman has been on five championship teams -- two with Detroit,  
three with Chicago. However, at age 37, he has grown weary of the 
game. Still, he says, he plans to help get the Lakers a title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't expecting these guys to come over and shake my hand  
... or anything like that. I expected the team to go on as though 
nothing happened. So, that's what we did.''

<HEADLINE> Torre Released From Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Joe Torre's cancer was limited to his  
prostate gland and there is no trace of the disease in the lymph 
nodes of the New York Yankees manager, according to pathology 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre was released from Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis on  
Sunday and the Yankees said he will undergo tests in about a month 
to determine if any further treatment is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre had surgery Thursday. Dr. William Catalona, who performed  
the procedure, said patients normally need 6-to-12 weeks recovery 
time before returning to work. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Brian Cashman said he spoke with Torre about  
baseball matters three or four times on Saturday, and Cashman said 
Torre will be consulted on roster cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Interim manager Don Zimmer spoke with Torre at 6:30 a.m. Sunday  
and said his boss sounded ``outstanding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's 5:30 his time,'' Zimmer said. ``He said, `You can't get  
any rest in the hospital. Every hour and a half they come in with 
your thermometer or take your blood pressure.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre was released at about noon Sunday, a day or two earlier  
than expected, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre was pleased with the hospital care, but he was anxious to  
be released, said family friend Jeff Wehling, who lives in St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. Catalona said because Joe was in excellent health, he was  
recovering better than most men. So he decided to let him go home 
early,'' Wehling said. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre will head to Florida to recuperate, according to Wehling.  
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to be near the team, but he also thought it would be  
better to be there because the weather is much warmer than in New 
York, and he can get out and do his walking,'' Wehling said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees minor league catcher Jaime Torres could return in  
approximately six weeks following treatment for thyroid cancer. 
Cashman said the condition, which was detected last week, is not 
life or career threatening. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very small spot on the thyroid,'' Cashman said. ``The  
prognosis is excellent. 
</P>
<P>
	Torres, 28, appeared in five spring training games and was  
assigned to the minor league camp on March 17. Torres spilt last 
season between Double-A Norwich and Triple-A Columbus.

<HEADLINE> New Probe Scrutinizes Mars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Two decades after the twin Viking orbiters wowed scientists with  
images of Mars' gargantuan volcanoes and canyons, a new robotic 
envoy is ready to lift the veil on the red planet's mysterious 
past. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a one-year delay, NASA's Mars Global Surveyor began  
mapping the dusty, frozen planet this month with a camera keen 
enough to detect objects the size of a Volkswagen beetle. 
</P>
<P>
	Swooping from pole to pole in a 240-mile-high orbit, Surveyor  
also packs an array of instruments that will search for prime 
landing sites for future landers and may explain what turned Mars' 
once-warm, water-harboring surface into a frigid, bone-dry realm of 
shifting dunes. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.,  
anticipation is running high among mission scientists, most of whom 
have worked 15 years to put the orbiter in its lofty perch above 
Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	``This mission will tell us more about Mars than all of the  
previous missions combined. It's been a long time coming and of 
course we're very eager,'' said Glenn E. Cunningham, deputy 
director of the Mars Exploration Program at JPL. 
</P>
<P>
	``This sets the stage for everything that follows,'' he added.  
</P>
<P>
	Launched in November 1996, Mars Global Surveyor reached Martian  
orbit in September 1997, two months after Mars Pathfinder landed on 
the surface and deployed a rover, grabbing headlines worldwide. But 
to most planetary scientists, it was the arrival of Surveyor -- not 
Pathfinder -- that had been eagerly awaited. 
</P>
<P>
	For a full 687-day Martian year, Surveyor would scan Mars as it  
turned underneath, keeping watch over its shifting weather patterns 
and waxing and waning polar caps. The 2,300-pound orbiter would 
snap wide- and narrow-angle photographs for a global mosaic at 
least 20 times sharper than the one produced by the Viking orbiters 
in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the non-optical instruments would peer down, shedding  
light on Mars' Earth-like past by collecting information about its 
weak magnetic field and the distribution of its surface minerals. 
</P>
<P>
	And there was always the chance of stumbling across the  
unexpected -- extinct hot springs or lingering volcanic hot spots. 
</P>
<P>
	As it turned out, Mars wasn't giving up its secrets so easily.  
</P>
<P>
	Surveyor arrived in a highly elliptical orbit that would be  
trimmed to a circular, two-hour mapping orbit by skimming it across 
Mars' upper atmosphere -- a process called aerobraking. But a solar 
panel began wobbling shortly after aerobraking began, forcing 
mission controllers to pull the spacecraft out of the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	They soon learned the solar panel had been damaged during its  
deployment. To reduce the risk of the panel shearing off, Surveyor 
would have to be slowly eased into its circular orbit, delaying the 
start of the mapping mission from March 1998 until March 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Surveyor scientists were disappointed but relieved the probe  
hadn't met the same fate of its bigger, more expensive predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1 billion Mars Observer was only three days away from  
reaching Mars when it suddenly fell silent in August 1993, leaving 
Earth-bound scientists under a cloud of gloom. 
</P>
<P>
	The mission, loaded with more instruments than Mars Global  
Surveyor, had been the most ambitious ever sent to Mars. 
Investigators concluded that a broken fuel line probably sent it 
spinning into space. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a crushing blow to these guys. It really was,''  
Cunningham recalled. ``Some of these people's whole careers were 
based on that mission. We had psychological advisers come in to 
help. Everyone had been so fired up about the mission -- it was a 
big psychological blow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After that costly disaster, NASA raced to construct a cheaper  
follow-up mission. Plans for the $250 million Surveyor, made from 
Mars Observer's spare parts, soon emerged. 
</P>
<P>
	Though less sophisticated than Mars Observer, Surveyor is  
expected to accomplish most of its mission goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before mapping began March 9, its camera had used the long  
aerobraking mission to snap thousands of photographs, some taken 
from as close as 100 miles -- 140 miles closer than the eventual 
mapping orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	Those images showed extensive layering in the walls of the  
2,400-mile-long Valles Marineris canyon. Scientists believe that's 
evidence volcanoes spewed 10 times more lava onto Mars during its 
first 3 billion years than had been previously believed. 
</P>
<P>
	There were also signs of eruptions as recent as 40 million years  
ago and tantalizing photos of the rust-colored planet's meandering 
river valleys and dune fields. 
</P>
<P>
	And when Surveyor passed over the spot where Viking I  
photographed a gape-mouthed ``Mars Face'' some earthlings saw as 
evidence of a Martian civilization, its superior optics revealed it 
as nothing but a bumpy hill that had fallen under the spell of late 
afternoon shadows. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that mapping is under way, Surveyor's camera is unmasking  
more compelling surface features. 
</P>
<P>
	The Viking orbiters snapped about 55,000 images, most showing  
objects only as small as 150 feet. But Surveyor can see objects 
smaller than 10 feet across, said Michael Malin, the mission's top 
camera scientist. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're seeing individual rocks the size of cars, something  
we've never seen before. The most exciting thing is right now we're 
seeing things we can't explain, geological landforms that challenge 
us,'' said Malin. 
</P>
<P>
	He and his team are comparing the newly acquired images to the  
best set of Viking photos to see whether anything has changed -- a 
landslide, a missing sand dune, or a new meteor impact crater. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Surveyor's laser altimeter is measuring the highs and  
lows of Mars' polar caps, volcanoes and gorges; its thermal 
emission spectrometer is mapping the planet's surface minerals. 
That map may show shorelines of ancient lakes or evidence of 
extinct hot springs where Martian life -- if it ever existed -- could 
have thrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Or maybe it will answer the main question about Mars: what  
happened to all the water scientists believe carved its gorges and 
valleys. Is it frozen underground, or did it evaporate into space? 
</P>
<P>
	``It's absolutely the big mystery and it's closely connected  
with the question of life. Where did all the water go?'' said Dr. 
Arden Albee, the Surveyor's project scientist at the California 
Institute of Technology in Pasadena, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	But Surveyor has one final test to pass before it can live up to  
its promise. The orbiter's high-gain antenna, mounted on the end of 
a 6-foot boom, remains in its stowed position, awaiting a signal 
from Earth to deploy it. 
</P>
<P>
	Until then, Surveyor must collect data on its solid state  
recorder and then turn back toward Earth to send that information 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	Mission scientists have delayed releasing the spring-activated  
boom because it's fitted with the same type of damper -- or 
cushioning device -- that apparently failed when Surveyor's solar 
panels were deployed. 
</P>
<P>
	Exhaustive tests on system replicas at JPL suggest that chances  
the boom might snap off, silencing Surveyor, are slim. Mission 
controllers intend to send the deployment commands March 29, but 
are using the first three weeks of mapping to photograph Mars' most 
interesting areas -- just in case. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to deploy the high-gain antenna and see what  
happens,'' said Cunningham. ``If all goes well, we'll be getting a 
steady stream of data from Mars.''

<HEADLINE> Gretzky Plans To Return Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wayne Gretzky could be back with the New York  
Rangers as early as this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping for Saturday or Monday next week,'' Gretzky told  
reporters after Sunday's 2-2 tie with the Pittsburgh Penguins. 
``I'll shoot for Saturday (against the Philadelphia Flyers) ... 
Anything else is a surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky said he had received clearance ``to skate and work out  
hard on my own and with guys who weren't playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Great One said he was feeling great and had ``tremendous  
mobility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't do any MRIs,'' Gretzky said. ``(The team doctor) was  
really going at my discretion on how I feel. I have skated really 
hard the last few days with the coaches and the other guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, the NHL's all-time leading scorer, was sidelined with a  
neck injury on Feb. 26 when he was in so much pain that he wasn't 
able to turn his head. The Rangers have gone 6-3-3 in the 12 games 
that Gretzky has missed. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky said he didn't expect to step right in and assume his  
accustomed position on the No. 1 line. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, the least of their concerns is getting me back into  
the lineup,'' Gretzky said. ``Nothing should be given to me. I will 
just practice and work hard, as I have all my career.''

<HEADLINE> Holyfield, Lewis Agree To Rematch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis have agreed on terms to fight  
again for the undisputed heavyweight championship. Now promoter Don 
King must find a date and a site willing to pay millions for a 
tarnished rematch. 
</P>
<P>
	King said Sunday that both fighters want the bout in September,  
and that both would be guaranteed $15 million for the rematch. 
Possible sites include New York, Las Vegas, London and South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight is far from a done deal, however. Among the issues  
remaining are terms of a pay-per-view deal with HBO, and whether 
the network and promoters for Lewis will agree to a fight in which 
King retains a major role. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, HBO has already reserved a September pay-per-view  
date for its other star fighter, Oscar De La Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no deal struck for a rematch,'' said HBO senior vice  
president Lou DiBella, whose network has a long-term contract with 
Lewis. ``We haven't sat down yet and spoken to Lewis and his 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The paydays would represent a $5 million cut for Holyfield and a  
$5 million increase for Lewis from their March 13 fight that ended 
in a controversial draw. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's parity and that's important,'' Lewis' manager, Frank  
Maloney, said. 
</P>
<P>
	King said he received Holyfield's signature for a rematch  
Saturday. Lewis had a clause in his contract for the first fight 
calling for him to get $15 million in any rematch. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the only corrective we have in boxing ... when we have  
a dispute is to have a rematch,'' King told Fox News Channel from 
his Florida home. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield kept his WBA and IBF titles while Lewis retained his  
WBC title when three ringside judges decided the 12-round bout that 
Lewis appeared to dominate was actually a draw. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision sparked three different investigations, with a  
particular focus on the scoring of Judge Eugenia Williams of 
Atlantic City, N.J., who scored the fight for Holyfield 115-113. 
Larry O'Connell of England scored it 115-115, while South African 
judge Stan Christodoulou favored Lewis, 116-113. 
</P>
<P>
	The fighters hadn't even left the ring and King was already  
trying to promote a rematch. Hours later, the heads of the WBA, IBF 
and WBC agreed, ordering a rematch within six months to unify the 
title once and for all. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the only fight that boxing needs at the moment.  
Nothing else matters,'' Maloney said from London. ``The only thing 
Lennox says is why has it taken so long to get it on again?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though the first fight was a financial success, selling out  
Madison Square Garden at prices ranging from $100 to $1,500 a seat 
and drawing 1.1 million pay-per-view buys, selling the rematch may 
be more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from the scoring dispute, there was little in the fight  
itself to merit a rematch. Holyfield, looking every day of his 36 
years, fought ineffectively and never hurt Lewis, who scored easily 
with jabs and right leads but never tried to put Holyfield away. 
</P>
<P>
	The result was a fight that settled into a predictable pattern  
after the fifth round, with neither fighter seemingly willing to 
risk what was necessary to take the decision out of the judge's 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Madison Square Garden paid $8.5 million to stage the fight, and  
sold some $11 million in tickets. But it's doubtful the same kind 
of money would be paid for the rematch, and Las Vegas casinos are 
also leery of paying big money for the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	That leaves open the possibility of King shopping the fight  
overseas, with England and South Africa mentioned as possible 
sites. Lewis fights out of England. 
</P>
<P>
	``The favorite at this moment in time has to be America with  
South Africa second and England and Scotland third and fourth,'' 
Lewis promoter Panos Eliades said. ``South Africa appeals to 
everybody but they need the money to pay people's expenses, to fly 
everyone in and house them down there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King, meanwhile, denied influencing the judging of the fight to  
keep control of the heavyweight titles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have nothing to do with the outcome of an event,'' King  
said. ``I have nothing to do with the appointment of the officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel the draw was justified because that's what the judges  
rendered.''

<HEADLINE> 4 Large Italy Banks Talk Mergers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- San Paolo and Unicredito Italiano -- Italy's largest  
and third-largest banks, respectively -- each proposed mergers 
Sunday that would reshape the top tier of the country's banking 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	Unicredito Italiano said it would propose a merger to Banca  
Commerciale Italiana. If BCI accepted, the deal would create 
Italy's largest bank, with assets of about $286 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Unicredito said it would offer eight ordinary shares for every  
five of BCI's. Unicredito's board authorized the offer after 
``doing everything to assure that it was a friendly offer,'' the 
bank said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate response from BCI.  
</P>
<P>
	Hours after that bid was announced, Italy's current leading  
bank, San Paolo, said it would pursue a merger with Banca di Roma. 
</P>
<P>
	Their merger would produce a bank only slightly smaller than the  
Unicredito-BCI combination. 
</P>
<P>
	BCI is Italy's fourth-largest bank; Banca di Roma is the  
fifth-largest. 
</P>
<P>
	Merger talks among banks throughout Europe have become  
commonplace in anticipation of European monetary union. 
</P>
<P>
	Banca di Roma broke off talks with BCI two weeks ago and allowed  
a Dutch holding company to take a stake, setting off this weekend's 
merger talks.

<HEADLINE> Princess Anne Calls for IOC Shakeup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Princess Anne, who has remained silent during the  
biggest scandal in Olympic history, has written her fellow IOC 
members with suggestions on reforming the games. 
</P>
<P>
	An IOC member since 1988 and a former Olympic equestrian rider,  
the princess says the site of the Summer Games should be rotated 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	She also recommends limits on visits by IOC members and  
restrictions on who may serve in the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Princess Anne did not attend last week's emergency meeting in  
Switzerland in which the IOC expelled six members for accepting 
cash or other inducements during Salt Lake's successful bid for the 
2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	She wrote the other 105 members after reading the report of the  
investigation, and her comments appeared in the Sunday Times. 
</P>
<P>
	``I speak from experience of having been president of  
International Equestrian Federation when I first became a member of 
the IOC, that there are conflicts of interests that can put 
individuals under real pressure,'' she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	She suggests that in choosing the host for the Summer Games the  
world should be divided into quarters or thirds, with one city in 
each segment making a bid. 
</P>
<P>
	She also thinks heads of international sports federations should  
be banned from sitting on the IOC. That would prevent them from 
visiting bidding cities twice -- once as an IOC member and again as 
representatives of their federations. 
</P>
<P>
	The suggestion concerning federation heads is opposed by IOC  
president Juan Antonio Samaranch. He wants such individuals in the 
IOC but only as long as they lead their federation. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to the expulsions, which followed the resignations of  
four other members, Princess Anne said it was obvious ``the actions 
of a few have tarnished the movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot and must not condone such actions and the only  
option of those members of those members who have been compromised 
is to leave the movement,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She urged remaining members to ``live up to our own high  
standards and make sure that in Sydney only the best will do.''

<HEADLINE> 'Forces' Too Strong for Mob Comedy / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The romantic comedy ``Forces of Nature''  
knocked ``Analyze This'' from the top of the box office in a 
generally lackluster Oscar weekend, according to industry estimates 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie, starring Ben Affleck as a straight-laced groom-to-be  
who falls for free-spirited Sandra Bullock on the way to his 
wedding, opened with $13.9 million in ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``Analyze This'' had $11.9 million, dropping to No. 2 in its  
third week. The mobster-in-therapy comedy with Robert De Niro and 
Billy Crystal held the top spot for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	As Hollywood prepared for Sunday night's Academy Awards, only  
one Oscar-nominated film made it into the top 10. ``Shakespeare in 
Love,'' up for 13 nominations including best picture, was in ninth 
place with $2.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, box office receipts for the week's top 12 films totaled  
$58.1 million, down 25.4 percent over the same period last year, 
according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Final figures were to be released Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts suggested theaters gave up a ride on Oscar's gravy  
train by replacing contenders with new releases. 
</P>
<P>
	This time last year, crowds still were swarming to ``Titanic,''  
``Good Will Hunting'' and ``As Good As It Gets,'' said Robert 
Bucksbaum of Reel Source, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of high-profile movies that everyone wanted to see were  
still in the mainstream around Oscar time last year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	New releases had mixed results.  
</P>
<P>
	``True Crime,'' with Clint Eastwood as a broken-down reporter on  
a crusade to save a condemned man, was No. 3 with $5.3 million. The 
animated version of the musical ``The King and I'' placed sixth 
with $4.1 million. But ``Ravenous,'' a tale of cannibalism in the 
Old West, opened out of the Top 10 with a weak take of $950,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North  
American theaters: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Forces of Nature,'' $13.9 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Analyze This,'' $11.9 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``True Crime,'' $5.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``Baby Geniuses,'' $4.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Cruel Intentions,'' $4.2 million.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mom Develops Infant Jaundice Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Darby McFarlene watched nurses draw blood from  
her newborn's feet and head every day for six weeks to monitor a 
common but potentially dangerous condition called jaundice. 
</P>
<P>
	Bothered by the pain that her baby Scarlett had to endure 13  
years ago, McFarlene went out and developed a noninvasive jaundice 
test. 
</P>
<P>
	After nearly a decade in testing, her Colormate TLc (tender  
loving care) BiliTest cleared its final regulatory hurdle last 
month and is now being sent to hospitals and physicians nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a victory for Dr. Mom,'' said McFarlene, president of  
Chromatics Color Sciences International Inc., which makes the 
handheld diagnostic device. Developing the test for jaundice -- a 
condition characterized by the yellow tint it gives to skin -- was a 
natural step for her 15-year-old-New York City-based company, which 
specializes in measuring colors for the cosmetics and health 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
	About 60 percent of the 4 million babies born annually in the  
United States become jaundiced in the first three or four days 
after birth, and it is the most common cause of newborn readmission 
to hospitals. Nearly all premature babies are born with the 
condition, which can cause brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The severity of jaundice is determined by the level of bilirubin  
in the blood. Bilirubin, which is produced naturally by the 
breaking down of the body's red blood cells, often builds up faster 
than a newborn's liver can break it down for the body to get rid 
of. While the problem usually corrects itself after a few days in 
most babies, some like Scarlett McFarlene have to endure weeks of 
evaluation and treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	A blood test has been the standard bilirubin test for decades.  
While some attempts at a noninvasive test were tried before, none 
were accurate enough to replace the traditional test. 
</P>
<P>
	The TLc test, though, has proven 95 percent accurate, compared  
to traditional blood tests, according to a study published in the 
Pediatrics medical journal last September. 
</P>
<P>
	``It should make a big difference,'' said Dr. Alan Greene, a  
pediatrician in San Mateo, Calif., who also runs a pediatric Web 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	The noninvasive test will ensure that more babies get tested and  
speed up the time it takes for doctors to get results from a 
several hours to a few minutes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This device will be extremely welcomed,'' said Dr. James  
Lemons, a neonatologist at Indiana University Medical Center and 
chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics' fetus and newborn 
care committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The TLc device costs between $3,000 and $5,000 depending on the  
model, and then each test cost about $10, about the same as a blood 
test, McFarlene said. 
</P>
<P>
	The test uses a small light sensor that measures the yellow  
pigment in the baby's skin. The more yellow the skin, the higher 
the bilirubin level. The key to the device is that it can account 
for more than 210 different natural skin color types, and the 
effect on skin color change from light therapy, which is the most 
common treatment for jaundice. 
</P>
<P>
	McFarlene was able to develop the new test because Chromatics  
already had much experience using computers to get precise 
measurements of colors. Chromatics, for example, has worked with 
Clairol in developing hair coloring and also with Avon's cosmetic 
products. The company also was aided by researchers at Mt. Sinai 
Hospital in New York City which spent more than a decade conducting 
studies on the device. 
</P>
<P>
	Chromatics is hoping the jaundice test will help restore it to  
profitability. The publicly traded company lost $5 million in 1997 
on revenues of only $250,000. The company estimates about $330 
million is spent annually in the United States on blood tests for 
jaundice. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,000 newborns were tested on the device before it won  
approval from the federal Food and Drug Administration. Though the 
device was approved in 1997, it took until earlier this year for 
the company to get its manufacturing process approved. 
</P>
<P>
	``All parents prefer not have their baby stuck,'' said Dr. Ian  
Holzman, chief of the division of newborn medicine at Mt. Sinai 
Hospital and chief investigator of the TLc studies at the facility. 
</P>
<P>
	The test does not totally eliminate the need for newborns to get  
blood tests, which are required by state and federal government to 
test for an assortment of maladies and birth defects. Rather, the 
test will be most helpful for newborns whose level of jaundice 
requires treatment, and thus need to be monitored for days or 
weeks.

<P>
	McFarlene hopes to use the technology behind the jaundice test  
to develop noninvasive tests for other medical conditions, such as 
skin cancer, thyroid disorders and sickle cell anemia.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Urges Compliance With Oil Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- OPEC ministers eager to end a global oil  
glut expressed hope Sunday that oil-exporting nations would abide 
by production cuts of more than 2 million barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
	The new quotas, which are to begin April 1, would remain in  
effect for a full year, Venezuelan Oil Minister Ali Rodriguez said 
ahead of Tuesday's meeting of the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting is expected to result in formal approval of  
production cuts agreed upon earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are here ... to save the situation of the collapsing prices  
of oil. That is our main objective,'' Iraq's Oil Minister Amer 
Mohammed Rasheed said after arriving at a Vienna hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Excess supply and a weak demand for winter heating oil sent  
prices plunging to 12-year lows late last year. Although consumers 
have benefitted from cheaper oil and gasoline, the soft market has 
inflicted economic pain on producers, including Britain, Norway and 
the oil-patch American states of Texas and Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices finally began climbing two weeks ago, when  
representatives of OPEC's three biggest members -- Saudi Arabia, 
Iran and Venezuela -- along with Algeria and nonmember Mexico agreed 
at a meeting in the Netherlands to reduce output. On the New York 
Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for April delivery rose 24 cents to 
$15.46 a barrel on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, Saudi Arabia will take the biggest cut -- 585,000  
barrels from its current production of more than 8 million barrels 
a day. No. 2 producer Iran will pump 264,000 fewer barrels a day, 
while Rodriguez confirmed that Venezuela will trim daily output by 
125,000 barrels. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali Naimi said Sunday he expected  
full compliance with the new, lower levels of production. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC estimates the current output of its 11 members at 27.66  
million barrels a day. At this level, supply exceeds demand by 
about 500,000 barrels, according to the Paris-based International 
Energy Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The success of OPEC's effort to buoy prices by pumping less oil  
depends upon the compliance of each member, Rodriguez said. 
Cheating has been a chronic problem for the group. 
</P>
<P>
	Libya, one of the last OPEC members to confirm the size of its  
planned production cut, will pump 96,000 fewer barrels a day 
beginning April 1, said Libyan Oil Minister Abdalla Salem El-Badri. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that everybody will abide by the agreement,'' El-Badri  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Non-OPEC members pledging to reduce production include Mexico,  
Russia, Oman and Norway.

<HEADLINE> Kentucky Denied in Final Four Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The end for Scott Padgett and Heshimu Evans was  
nothing like they'd imagined. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky's two seniors were notorious by their absence of  
production in the Midwest Regional final Sunday as the Wildcats 
were denied their fourth consecutive Final Four appearance. Padgett 
had 11 points on 3-of-8 shooting and Evans, after scoring 12 points 
in the first 9:42, went without a point the rest of the way as the 
defending national champions lost 73-66 to No. 1 seed Michigan 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans was a big reason Kentucky (28-9) twice led by 13 points in  
the first half. But he also played out of control at times on the 
defensive end and sat out much of the second half with foul 
trouble. He was so out of sync that coach Tubby Smith took him out 
with 1:42 to go and the game still hanging in the balance. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was off to a great start,'' Smith said. ``I think that hurt  
us, him getting into foul trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evans was having trouble adjusting to the fact there will be no  
more games and that Kentucky no longer has a shot at becoming the 
first team since Duke in 1990 and '91 to repeat as national 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of our attention was to make it to the Final Four,'' Evans  
said. ``We knew as the road continued it was going to get tougher. 
But I'm not going to hang my head. We just got beat by a good 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of Padgett's points came in the final 1:42 and his second  
3-pointer in that stretch, with 18.8 seconds to go, cut the gap to 
69-66. But in the final six minutes he also missed the front end of 
the one-and-one from the foul line and the second of two free 
throws in another situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Padgett had a career-high 29 points in the second round against  
Kansas, and scored 14 of his 17 points in the second half on Friday 
night against Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``Usually I don't miss too many free throws,'' said Padgett, a  
68-percent shooter. ``Those are the shots you need to make.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said Michigan State's quickness, especially at the forward  
position, was a key to neutralizing his top threats. Kentucky made 
seven of its first 10 shots and shot 51.7 percent in the first 
half, but was 9-for-24 the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time I came off a screen, they switched everything,''  
Padgett said. ``When I tried to get to the paint, they switched to 
a big guy and fronted me. I also missed two or three open shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had some good looks and I didn't make them today.''  
</P>
<P>
	Don't feel too sorry for Kentucky, which has won 132 games the  
last four seasons to tie its own four-year record set from 1995-98. 
Smith got good production in the tournament from freshmen Tayshaun 
Prince, Desmond Allison and Jules Camara, and sophomore Saul Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Prince, who had nine points in the first three tourney games,  
had 12 Sunday on 3-of-3 shooting and hit both of his 3-point 
attempts. Allison had seven points. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sit here in awe of all the accomplishments and accolades,  
both as a team and individually, that they achieved,'' Smith said 
of the departing seniors. ``They set a template for me to follow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The loss was Kentucky's first in 10 NCAA tournament games.

<HEADLINE> Stars Reacquire Hogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas Stars on Sunday reacquired forward  
Benoit Hogue who left the club as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars obtained the much-traveled Hogue and a conditional  
draft pick in 2001 from the Tampa Bay Lightning in exchange for 
defenseman Sergey Gusev. 
</P>
<P>
	``Benoit will add depth and experience to our group of  
forwards,'' said Stars general manager Bob Gainey. ``He will be a 
valuable addition to our team as we enter the stretch run of the 
season and the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hogue, 32, had 11 goals and 14 assists in 62 games this season  
with the Lightning. He was third on the team in goals and points. 
He signed with the Lightning as a free agent last summer after 
playing two-plus seasons with the Stars. 
</P>
<P>
	In 732 career games with the Buffalo Sabres, New York Islanders,  
Toronto Maple Leafs, Stars and Lightning, Hogue has 208 goals and 
293 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	He had six goals and 16 assists in 53 contests with the Stars in  
1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	Gusev, 23, had one goal with four assists in 22 games with the  
Stars this season. He also has six assists in 11 games with the 
Michigan K-Wings, the Stars' International Hockey League affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
	Hogue was expected to join the division-leading Stars on Monday.

	Clouds and rain showers darkened New England on Sunday. Storms  
also developed over the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast, while dry 
weather dominated the Plains. 
</P>
<P>
	A very dry frontal system along with high pressure in the  
Dakotas and in the Texas Panhandle kept locations from the front 
range of the Rockies to the Mississippi River dry. 
</P>
<P>
	An area of low pressure pushing into the Intermountain West  
continued to provide some precipitation to the region. Spotty 
showers and a few thundershowers were scattered across southern 
Wyoming and northeastern Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	A few clouds were also moving through portions of Washington and  
Southern California, however the clouds were more scattered in 
these areas. The desert Southwest through the southern Rockies were 
under fair skies and dry conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures across the Lower 48 ranged from a low of 7 in  
Milan, N.H., to an afternoon high of 81 in Titusville, Fla. With 
the wind chill, it felt like minus 18 in Grand Marais, N.H.

	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Welton, Clint Mathis and Daniel  
Hernandez scored in the shootout to help the Los Angeles Galaxy 
defeat the Colorado Rapids 2-1 Saturday night in the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathis gave Los Angeles a 1-0 lead in the 14th minute. Welton  
took Joe Franchino's pass and dribbled all the way into the penalty 
area. Peter Vermes then poked the ball away, and it rolled to 
Mathis, who put a 15-yard shot past goalkeeper Marcus Hahnemann.

Jones' shot. The rebound went to Mathis, whose header rolled wide 
and out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles took a 2-0 lead in the shootout on goals by Welton

<HEADLINE> Report: Aikman Went to Mobster Bash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman attended  
two parties hosted by Dominick Montemarano, a convicted racketeer, 
the Daily News reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the newspaper said that Aikman wasn't suspected of any  
wrongdoing. Aikman's agent, Leigh Steinberg, said the three-time 
Super Bowl winner had little contact with Montemarano. 
</P>
<P>
	``He went there with a friend, David Norrie, and never really  
spent any time with (Montemarano),'' Steinberg was quoted as 
saying. ``Troy had no idea about his background at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts by The Associated Press to reach Steinberg on Sunday  
were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	Norrie, a former UCLA quarterback like Aikman, said Aikman  
wasn't worried. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows he's done nothing wrong,'' Norrie said. ``He just  
went to a social gathering, where there were 20 or 30 other 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said that Rick Neuheisel, the recently appointed  
Washington football coach and former Colorado coach, also attended 
one of Montemarano's parties. He, too, said he was unaware of 
Montemarano's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	``David's a good friend and he invited me to one of Dominick's  
Monday Night Football parties when I was in town recruiting,'' 
Neuheisel told the newspaper. ``I had no idea who (Montemarano) 
was. I was shocked. ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montemarano was convicted of racketeering with mob boss Carmine  
Persico in 1986. He served 11 years of an 18-year sentence before 
being released. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, the News reported that Montemarano and current UCLA  
football players, including star quarterback Cade McNown, were the 
focus of a coast-to-coast point-shaving probe by the FBI. No 
evidence was found of any wrongdoing by any athlete.

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays' Fernandez Chases Fan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUNEDIN, Fla. (AP) -- Toronto Blue Jays infielder Tony Fernandez  
chased after a fan Sunday after he was heckled between morning 
workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez, who ran into the stands after the fan, had to be  
restrained by manager Jim Fregosi and pitching coach Mel Queen. 
</P>
<P>
	The confrontation began when the man asked Fernandez for an  
autograph as the player left the field and headed to the Blue Jays' 
covered batting cages. Fernandez said he'd sign after his workout. 
</P>
<P>
	The fan became snide, saying, ``Oh, you're just going to the  
clubhouse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After several exchanges, with the fan provocatively calling out  
for security, Fernandez dropped his bats and jogged through a gate 
in a chain-link fence separating players from fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Fregosi and Queen, who were chatting nearby, raced over to pull  
Fernandez back on to the field. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Gold Glove shortstop said the same fan bothered him  
Saturday.

	ATHENS, Ohio (AP) -- Terry Anderson, the former Associated Press

was held hostage in Lebanon. The lawsuit accuses Iran of having 
sponsored his captors. But the biggest obstacle to Anderson's 
getting any money may be the U.S. government. The Clinton 
administration has thwarted plaintiffs in similar lawsuits from 
collecting millions of dollars awarded by U.S. courts, even though 
the damage claims are against countries the State Department labels 
as sponsors of terrorism. In October, the president issued a 
blanket waiver of a requirement that federal agencies help obtain 
that money.

<HEADLINE> UConn Men Advance; Women Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STORRS, Conn. -- This is a campus in conflict, with delight and  
disappointment going head-to-head. The Connecticut men's basketball 
team is heading to its first Final Four. The women's team, a 
national power for so long, has been eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
	For much of this year, they traveled parallel paths.  
</P>
<P>
	Both are perennial Big East beasts and captured the conference  
crowns. They shared the No. 1 national ranking for a short spell. 
They were top seeds in their NCAA regionals. 
</P>
<P>
	That all changed Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	The men's 67-62 squeaker over Gonzaga boosted the program to its  
first Final Four in 21 tries. Hours earlier, dismal shooting doomed 
the women, who were upset 64-58 by Iowa State. The loss was the 
first regional semifinal loss for a program which won the national 
title in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an up and down day,'' said Jim Patrick, a season  
ticketholder for the men and women. He was among the scores of fans 
streaming into the campus bookstore Sunday for Final Four 
merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick said the men's win brought a lot of relief.  
</P>
<P>
	``It felt good for them to finally get it off their backs,'' he  
said. ``They definitely struggled (Saturday). They played tight in 
all the close games this year. But they had character to win 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Calhoun's team advanced on the strength of its rebounding.  
Scrappy Gonzaga, the No. 10 seed in the West Regional, wouldn't go 
away. But the Huskies (32-2) had 10 second-chance points in the 
last eight minutes and outrebounded the Bulldogs 47-33. 
</P>
<P>
	Post players Jake Voskuhl, Kevin Freemen and Edmund Saunders  
decided early on in the second half to get every rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just looked at Kevin, Kevin looked at me,'' said Voskuhl.  
``It's time to do it, time to turn it up a notch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The women couldn't find the hoop for most of the game. They shot  
11 percent on 3-pointers and were just under 30 percent from the 
field. Scoring leader Shea Ralph was 2-of-12 from the field. Geno 
Auriemma's team finished 29-5, missing out on its sixth straight 
30-win season. 
</P>
<P>
	Bookstore employee Cheri Majnich juggled jubilation and sadness  
on what was to be her day off Sunday. The men's win meant a change 
in her schedule, the women's loss was ``heartbreaking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans of both programs were lined up outside the store before its  
doors opened at noon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been crazy,'' said Majnich. ``The phone hasn't stopped  
ringing. We knew if they won, we had all this stuff coming in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carole Levin showed up to support both teams. A Connecticut  
native who moved out of state for many years, she measures her 
years back home in basketball time. The 1994-95 season was her 
first year back and was the year the women jumped into the national 
spotlight with a 35-0 record and the national title. The women have 
been to the Final Four three times. 
</P>
<P>
	Both programs, she said, help get her through the bleak New  
England winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winter in Connecticut so gray, so drab, the men's and women's  
basketball, make winter tolerable,'' said Levin. 
</P>
<P>
	On this rural campus where the passing of the year is measured  
in snowfall, rainfall and basketball, the first day of spring -- 
Saturday -- may have ushered in a season of change. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of the Husky men watching the women, it will be just the  
opposite. But that doesn't mean fans have forgotten about 
Auriemma's squad. 
</P>
<P>
	``The women have the whole team back,'' said Patrick. ``There's  
no reason why they won't do better next year.''

<HEADLINE> NHL Trading Activity Picks Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Break up the New York Islanders? Actually, general manager Mike  
Milbury is doing a pretty good job of it all by himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Never shy about making trades, Milbury pulled off three over the  
weekend as the NHL's trading deadline loomed on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Islanders traded goaltender Tommy Salo to Edmonton, center  
Robert Reichel to Phoenix and left wing Ted Donato to Ottawa on a 
busy day Saturday that included a blockbuster, seven-player deal 
between the Oilers and Chicago Blackhawks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The number of teams with a No. 1 goalie is broad,'' Milbury  
said after dealing Salo to Edmonton for center-left wing Mats 
Lindgren and an eighth-round pick in this year's entry draft. ``The 
market for a No. 1 goalie is limited. I bandied a bunch of names 
around and settled on Lindgren.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salo is making a clean start in Edmonton after an unhappy season  
with the Islanders. Salo was miffed when Milbury acquired goalie 
Felix Potvin from Toronto earlier this season. He debuted Saturday 
night by making 23 saves in a victory over Vancouver, helping the 
Oilers end a six-game winless streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Potvin had a rough start and Salo got more work when Bill  
Stewart replaced Milbury as coach. Potvin has been out recently 
with an injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``He could see it coming,'' Milbury said of trading Salo. ``It  
hasn't worked for him or the team and when it doesn't work, it's 
time to move on. I wish him the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milbury dealt left wing Donato to the Ottawa Senators for a  
fourth-round pick. Then he sent center Robert Reichel and two draft 
picks to the Phoenix Coyotes for left wing Brad Isbister and one of 
Phoenix's picks. 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding the 6-foot-4 Lingren, who had five goals in 48 games  
for the Oilers, Milbury said: 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got some size. He's versatile in that he can play both  
center and left wing. He's good on draws, and we think he can score 
more than he's shown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milbury started to change the Islanders dramatically when he  
sent promising young defenseman Bryan Berard to Toronto in the deal 
for Potvin. He started clearing out the veterans on March 9 when he 
traded defenseman Scott Lachance to Montreal for a third-round 
pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Milbury said that Lachance's trade was a salary dump, since he  
felt he wasn't worth tending a qualifying offer at $1.25 million as 
a Group-V free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Oilers general manager Glen Sather, who promised that changes  
would be made in Edmonton, not only acquired Salo from the 
Islanders but four players in a seven-player swap with Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a major shakeup for the team and it is unfortunate to do  
it at this time of the year, but we felt we needed to inject some 
life into the club,'' Sather said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oilers, battling Calgary for the eighth and final playoff  
spot in the NHL's Western Conference, have won only once in their 
last seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	Sather sent defenseman Boris Mironov, forward Dean McAmmond and  
prospect Jonas Elofsson to the Blackhawks for center Chad Kilger, 
left wings Daniel Cleary and Ethan Moreau and defenseman Christian 
Laflamme. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have enough depth up front that we can afford to do  
something like this,'' Blackhawks general manager Bob Murray told 
WMAQ-AM in Chicago. ``We're giving up a lot of young potential in 
this deal and I just felt we were deep enough that the time was now 
to do something with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other deals Saturday, the Philadelphia Flyers acquired left  
wing Mikael Andersson and right wing Sandy McCarthy from the Tampa 
Bay Lightning in a trade for left wing Colin Forbes and a 
conditional draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL trading deadline is 3 p.m. on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Women's Basketball Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	And now, the toughest, most pressure-packed round of all in the  
NCAA women's basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Three No. 1 seeds remain standing among the eight teams getting  
ready for Monday night's regional championship games, which 
determine who goes to the Final Four in San Jose, Calif., next 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee coach Pat Summitt has said that because a trip to the  
Final Four is so close, the regional finals are the most difficult 
games in the tournament. And she knows from experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Tennessee had to rally from 12 points down to beat  
North Carolina 76-70 in the Mideast finals. The Lady Vols then 
routed Arkansas and Louisiana Tech to win their third straight 
national championship and finish 39-0. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, another Atlantic Coast Conference team stands between  
Tennessee and trip to the Final Four. The top-seeded Lady Vols 
(31-2) play No. 3 seed Duke (27-6) in the East Regional at 
Greensboro, N.C., and in Summitt's view, survival depends more on 
mental toughness than talent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have maintained the commitment to going out and being the  
best team in March with more or less talent,'' she said. ``You've 
got to look at your team and look at your opposition and think 
about how you have to influence them. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this time of year it's a lot about being mentally strong  
and disciplined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other No. 1 seeds still playing are in the Midwest and West.  
Top-ranked Purdue (31-1) takes a 29-game winning streak against 
third-seeded Rutgers (29-5) in the Midwest at Normal, Ill. In the 
West at Los Angeles, top-seeded Louisiana Tech (29-2), seeking a 
10th Final Four trip, plays No. 3 seed UCLA (26-7). 
</P>
<P>
	The surprise team at this point is No. 4 seed Iowa State (25-7)  
in the Mideast. The Cyclones, who had won only one NCAA tournament 
game before this year, play third-seeded Georgia (26-6) in 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee and Duke met earlier this year, with Tennessee winning  
74-60 in December. Duke coach Gail Goestenkors welcomes the 
rematch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether we want to admit it or not, we were a little  
intimidated going on the floor with them that first game,'' 
Goestenkors said. ``It took us a half to get through that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Duke player with the biggest challenge is sophomore Georgia  
Schweitzer, who has to guard All-American Chamique Holdsclaw. 
Holdsclaw, as usual, has elevated her play in March, scoring 23, 39 
and 27 points in her three tournament games. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just try to keep her from taking over the game,''  
Schweitzer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue will have to crack a tough Rutgers defense to keep its  
winning streak intact. That defense was sensational in the regional 
semifinals Saturday night, holding Texas Tech to 11 first-half 
points in a 53-42 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people play defense out of responsibility, because  
they're supposed to,'' Rutgers coach Vivian Stringer said. ``We 
embrace it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue will counter with its outstanding guard court of  
Stephanie White-McCarty, Ukari Figgs and Katie Douglas. They 
combined for 63 points in Saturday night's 82-59 victory over North 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just need to go out and attack with the offensive style we  
have,'' Figgs said. ``I don't think we're intimidated by it. We 
just want to go out and play our game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana Tech will apply its pressure defense against a UCLA  
team that probably won't have point guard Erica Gomez, who sprained 
her right ankle 25 seconds into the Bruins' semifinal victory over 
Colorado State. 
</P>
<P>
	She'll be replaced by freshman Michelle Greco, who filled in  
Saturday night and committed only two turnovers in 39 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to stay out of foul trouble and know who to go to in  
certain situations,'' Greco said. ``They're a very fast team, 
aggressive and athletic. I'm not going to be able to dribble 
through three of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa State stunned top-seeded Connecticut 64-58 on Saturday with  
a flurry of 3-point baskets at the end. In Georgia, the Cyclones 
face an opponent with a crafty coach, Andy Landers, who has won 31 
NCAA tournament games and already has made four trips to the Final 
Four. 
</P>
<P>
	Landers has built the kind of program that Iowa State is trying  
to become. The victory over Connecticut was a big step in that 
direction, coach Bill Fennelly said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the proof now that we're a decent team,'' Fennelly  
said. ``We've won 25 games, made it this far and beaten a good 
team. We have a lot more credibility now. We would love to go and 
continue to play.''

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Two small planes carrying 15 people were  
reported missing Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescue workers said they have been unable to locate the planes,  
which were carrying a TV crew and government development workers. 
</P>
<P>
	A DC-3 cargo plane carrying eight people vanished Thursday after  
flying out of Cucuta, 390 miles northeast of Bogota near the border 
with Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
	The other plane, a Piper carrying a two-man TV crew and  
officials from a federal agency working to curb illegal drug crops, 
disappeared Saturday in storm weather near Ataco, 110 miles 
southwest of Bogota in Tolima state. 
</P>

mountainous region, not to fire on search helicopters.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Police arrested two police  
officers and three women Sunday in the kidnapping of a Brazilian 
pop duo's brother, hours after the man was released. 
</P>
<P>
	Wellington Camargo, who had part of his ear severed during his  
captivity, was receiving medical treatment but appeared well, his 
family's lawyer Paulo Viana said in TV interview. 
</P>
<P>
	A 28-year-old paraplegic, Camargo was seized on Dec. 16 in  
Goiania, capital of midwestern state Goias, 840 miles northwest of 
Rio. Late Friday, his brothers, country music stars Zeze di Camargo 
and Luciano, paid a $300,000 ransom. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after his release Sunday, Wellington Camargo was found by a  
motorcyclist 18 miles from Goiania, TV Globo reported. Police later 
arrested three women and two police officers in connection with the 
kidnapping.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The government has helped free 777  
people from slave labor since 1995 but hundreds more still work 
against their will in Brazil, a magazine reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Employment Ministry has set up an armed team to rescue  
enslaved men, women and children, said Veja magazine, which cited 
previously undisclosed ministry figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The team targets the poor central and northern Brazilian states  
of Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Maranhao and Para, where 
unemployed workers are attracted to farms by offers of work. 
</P>
<P>
	Some farm owners force the people to work as long as 15 hours a  
day at unpaid manual labor and threaten them with violence, even 
death, if they try to leave, said Veja, Brazil's largest news 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Though slavery was officially abolished in Brazil in 1888,  
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso admitted in 1995 that slave 
labor continued and vowed to combat it. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, a farm owner in Para state was given a 2 1/2-year  
suspended prison sentence for keeping slaves. A second farm owner, 
accused of enslaving 220 workers in the same state, is currently on 
trial, the magazine said.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A leader of a religious sect was shot to  
death while riding in his pickup truck, Mexican newspapers reported 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ausencio Velazquez Huerta, a leader of ``The New Jerusalem''  
sect, was shot twice Saturday near Puruaran, in the western state 
of Michoacan. There have been no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	The state attorney general's office said Velazquez Huerta was  
returning from a shopping trip when a man jumped out and fired six 
times into the truck, striking Velazquez Huerta twice, the 
newspaper Reforma reported. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, more than 300 people were expelled from the community  
for not complying with the sect's rules. It was not known if the 
shooting was related to the expulsions.

	SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) -- San Salvador's cathedral has  
reopened almost 13 years after being damaged in an earthquake, but 
more work needs to be done on the building, the auxiliary bishop 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of people attended the first public Mass on Sunday,  
two days after the cathedral formally reopened. 
</P>
<P>
	The 43-year-old cathedral in the center of the city was badly  
damaged during an October 1986 earthquake that killed hundreds of 
Salvadorans. The high cost of the repairs -- $5 million -- slowed the 
reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Much work still needs to be done and church leaders hope to  
finish by the end of 2000, auxiliary bishop Gregorio Rosa Chavez 
told reporters. Workers must still install furniture, frame 
pictures, and decorate. 
</P>
<P>
	Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero is buried in a special crypt in  
the cathedral. Romero, who criticized abuses by the Salvadoran 
military during the country's civil war, was killed March 24, 1980, 
while celebrating Mass in a church in a northern part of San 
Salvador, the capital

</P>
<P>
	The body of Jaime Gutierrez Arreola was found at a recreational  
center in the city, across the border from McAllen, Texas, state 
police commander Juan Jose Muniz Salinas told Notimex. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that a driver had reported hearing a shootout at the  
recreational center and that a bullet had struck his car. 
</P>
<P>
	He said two four-wheel drive vehicles were found nearby later,  
both with several bullet holes.

<HEADLINE> Gonzaga Looks Forward to Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Gonzaga's Richie Frahm may get his wish --  
but the looming question is whether his coach will be with him next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to go out like this next year, too,'' the junior guard  
told 500 Gonzaga fans who gathered on campus Saturday night to 
greet the Bulldogs on their return from the NCAA West Region finals 
in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzaga's Cinderella run to the Elite Eight may have been  
unfathomable at the start of this season. But a return trip isn't 
out of the question because the Bulldogs are losing just three 
seniors to graduation. 
</P>
<P>
	The uncertainty is the future of coach Dan Monson, who may be  
lured away from the small Jesuit-run university by bigger schools 
with budgets that dwarf Gonzaga's $3.2 million in annual athletics 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools expressing interest so far include Washington State --  
just 75 miles south of Spokane in Pullman -- and San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
	But it may take more than money to send Monson packing. After  
the Bulldogs' 67-62 loss to Connecticut on Saturday, Monson said he 
has a strong attachment to Gonzaga. 
</P>
<P>
	``This (season) certainly makes it tougher, but it's going to be  
tough for me to leave anyway because it's a great group of kids, 
it's a university I believe in and it's an administration that's 
supportive,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old spent nine years as a Gonzaga assistant under  
Dan Fitzgerald, who hand-picked Monson as his successor when he 
stepped down at the end of the 1997 season. 
</P>
<P>
	In Monson's 11 years with Gonzaga, the Bulldogs have won 20 or  
more games six times and twice advanced to the NCAA tournament. The 
team, which plays in the low-profile West Coast Conference, 
finished with a school-record 28 victories this season against 
seven losses. 
</P>
<P>
	In deciding his future, Monson has said he may consider the  
experiences of his father. Don Monson had a successful run coaching 
Idaho before having a more difficult time at Oregon, a bigger 
school that fired him in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The three graduating seniors are starters Quentin Hall and  
Jeremy Eaton and reserve Mike Leasure. 
</P>
<P>
	Key returning players include current juniors Frahm and Matt  
Santangelo, who made Gonzaga one of the nation's top outside 
shooting threats this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Also back will be starting forward Casey Calvary and key  
reserves Axel Dench , Mark Spink and Ryan Floyd.

<HEADLINE> Film Makes Howard Reflect on Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Making ``Ed TV,'' a cautionary tale about the  
price of fame, caused filmmaker Ron Howard to reflect on his own 
lifelong celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally known since age 5 thanks to his part as Opie on ``The  
Andy Griffith Show,'' Howard struggled to fit in with the other 
kids at school and worked to make sure he didn't become another 
misfit child star. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of my code of life became defined by not fulfilling those  
cliches for people, which later included not being thrown in jail 
or being written up as a child actor on the rocks,'' Howard says in 
Sunday's Daily News. ``I consciously wanted to avoid those 
cliches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howard, 45, lives in Connecticut with his wife and four  
children, who range in age from 11 to 17. He says a lot has changed 
since he was a boy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a time when all a father had to do was offer decent  
shelter, put food on the table and be able to pay the bills,'' he 
said. ``As long as you weren't cruel and brutal, you were a fine 
fellow, a hell of a dad. That doesn't cut it today.''

	Yugoslav General Says Troops Ready  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A top Yugoslav Army general said today that  
the country's troops are prepared ``to repel any aggression against 
our country.'' That statement was made just hours before the U.S. 
makes a final diplomatic effort at peace by sending special U.S. 
envoy Richard Holbrooke to meet with Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic. Airstrikes are likely to follow if the talks end with 
Milosevic defiant on two counts: still refusing a Kosovo peace plan 
and persisting in pressing an offensive against outgunned Kosovo 
rebels.

	Statements on Train Crash May Conflict  
</P>
<P>
	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- Witnesses to the deadly Amtrak train  
crash may have given conflicting statements about whether a 
steel-laden truck was on the tracks before warning signals and 
crossing gates activated. ``We have not been able to completely 
reconcile the statements that are possibly conflicting,'' said 
National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Jamie Finch. He 
would not comment on what the possible conflicts were. Eleven 
people were killed and more than 100 injured in when the Amtrak

he was returning to his residence. Maskhadov was not hurt. One 
person was killed and eight were wounded by the radio-controlled 
device, said the president's press secretary, according to the

production cuts designed to slash total output by more than 2 
million barrels a day. The new quotas, which are to begin April 1, 
would remain in effect for a full year. Under the deal reached at 
The Hague, Saudi Arabia, which currently produces more than 8 
million barrels a day, will take the biggest cut -- 585,000 barrels. 
Formal approval of the production cuts is expected in a meeting

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The contest between a World War II combat  
movie and one about Shakespeare's early manhood reaches a climax 
this evening with the Academy Awards. After last year's blowout by 
``Titanic,'' the movie crowd seems to welcome a real race this 
year: between Steven Spielberg's unrelenting ``Saving Private 
Ryan'' and the romantic Elizabethan fantasy, ``Shakespeare in 
Love.'' The other candidates for best picture are ``Elizabeth,'' 
``Life Is Beautiful'' and ``The Thin Red Line.''

	Blue Devils in Final Four  
</P>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Duke surged into the Final Four  
with a 85-64 victory over sixth-seeded Temple in the East Regional 
final today. The Blue Devils extended their school-record winning 
streak to 31 games. They will be making their 12th Final Four 
appearance -- the eighth under coach Mike Krzyzewski. Duke's Trajan 
Langdon finished 5-for-6 from 3-point range and had 23 points, 
while Elton Brand had 21 points and eight rebounds. The loss 
deprived Owls coach John Chaney of his first trip to the Final 
Four.

<HEADLINE> Mateen Cleaves Energizes Spartans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Only once during Michigan State's Midwest  
Regional victory over Kentucky did Mateen Cleaves feel the pain of 
his violent, head-jarring collision 48 hours earlier with 
Oklahoma's Eduardo Najera. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we got down 17-4, my head started hurting,'' said the  
point guard who seems to energize the Spartans with his personality 
as well as his play. 
</P>
<P>
	``My head feels fine. But when we were losing big like that, it  
started to hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves, a powerfully built 6-foot-2, 195-pound junior, had 10  
points and 11 assists in the Spartans 73-66 victory over the 
defending champion Wildcats. But the enthusiasm and momentum he 
seemed to transfer to the Spartans were probably equally important. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cleaves made some big plays for them, kept getting the ball to  
the right people,'' said Kentucky coach Tubby Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleaves saved his biggest bucket for the end of the first half.  
Capping the remarkable comeback from a 17-4 deficit, he hit a long 
3-pointer at the buzzer that cut Kentucky's lead to 1 and gave the 
Spartans all the confidence they needed for the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a big, big lift for them, that shot by Mateen,'' said  
Kentucky coach Tubby Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Until then, Cleaves had been in a shooting slump going back to  
the semifinal victory over Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'd been trying to guide my shot,'' he said. ``But I  
just shot it and let it go. It was a good emotional lift for the 
guys and for me. That felt great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Tom Izzo cannot imagine this team without Cleaves, the  
most charismatic and probably the most talented point guard the 
Spartans have had since Magic Johnson guided them to their last 
appearance in the Final Four 20 seasons ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's funny,'' Izzo said. ``We've got a melting pot on our  
team, guys from big cities, guys from rural areas. But for some 
reason, they all gravitate to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him one day, `You know, you're the Pied Piper. Don't  
ever walk off a cliff because the guys will follow you.' It's 
amazing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Izzo has noticed that if something's wrong with Cleaves,  
something's wrong with the Spartans. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got a personality, something about him that people will  
follow,'' he said. ``Every one of them. If he's up, they're up. If 
he's down, they're down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the season when Cleaves went into a slump, the entire  
team was affected, Izzo said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jason Klein told me, `I need to get Mateen back,''' Izzo said.  
``That tells you what he means to this team.''
