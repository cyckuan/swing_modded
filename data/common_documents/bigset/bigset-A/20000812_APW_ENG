Buchanan Wins Reform Party Nod
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- In a victory bitterly contested by supporters of
party founder Ross Perot, Pat Buchanan won the Reform Party presidential
nomination tonight who refused to recognize the outcome. Their rival convention
named its own nominee. Buchanan and the nominee of the competing convention,
little-known physicist John Hagelin, may be headed to court to determine which
faction gains control of the party and $12.5 million in federal campaign
funding.

Gov't Adopts Simpler Health Forms

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an effort to reduce paperwork, the government has
adopted simpler health care forms for doctors to submit payment claims to
insurers by computer. The plan, announced Friday, establishes standard formats
for submitting electronic claims and other administrative health transactions.
All health care providers will be able to use the electronic format to bill for
their services, and all plans will be required to accept the forms. The
department expects the new forms to save the health care industry $29.9 billion
over 10 years.

Regulators Design New Tire Tests

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Highway safety regulators are trying to update 30-year-old
tests for automobile tires that would prevent surprises like the problems that
led to the Firestone tire failures. Experts say existing tests are insufficient
and regulators were blindsided by the Firestone tire failures, culminating in a
recall of 6.5 million tires this week. Neither the tire maker,
Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., nor Ford Motor Co., which used the tires on its
Explorer sport-utility vehicle, has been able to explain what caused the
failures.

Argentina Halts US Beef Exports

   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Fresh and frozen Argentine beef exports to
the United States have been suspended temporarily over concerns of possible
foot-and-mouth disease contamination, officials said Friday. The self-imposed
suspension by Argentina, the world's fourth-largest beef exporter, was taken as
a preventive measure after cattle bred near the Paraguayan border were believed
to be infected with the disease. Argentine Agriculture Secretary Antonio
Berhongaray said the decision to halt exports of fresh, chilled, and frozen beef
would not affect Argentina's status as a country free of the disease, a
designation bestowed more than a year ago.

White House Aide: Colombia Advances
</SUBHEAD>

   CARTAGENA, Colombia (AP) -- A key White House official said Friday that
President Clinton's upcoming visit to Colombia shows U.S. determination to be a
''reliable and dependable partner'' in the fight against drug trafficking. The
president's planned visit on Aug. 30 is the next logical American move following
passage last month of a $1.3 billion anti-narcotics measure to support
Colombia's war on drugs, said White House special envoy for the Americas,
Kenneth MacKay. MacKay, who is here in advance of Clinton's visit to this
Caribbean coast port city, said Colombia's fight against drugs will continue

<HEADLINE> 'Survivor' Spin-Off May Involve Mir  </HEADLINE>
By NICK WADHAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- ''Survivor'' lovers, brace yourselves. The
reality-TV game show rage may climax with the winning contestant in
a similar series blasting off for a stay aboard Russia's Mir space
station.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Burnett, producer of the wildly successful ''Survivor''
television series, has signed an agreement with the MirCorp
investment group to develop a project at Russia's cosmonaut
training facility outside Moscow, Burnett's manager said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The show, tentatively named ''Destination Mir,'' would track
contestants as they endure rigorous training in preparation for a
trip to the 14-year-old station. Russian training specialists would
eliminate contestants who aren't up to the task, and the last one
left would win a rocket ride to Mir.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, too broke to keep Mir aloft, considered dumping the
space station in the ocean earlier this year, but then turned to
MirCorp for help securing commercial contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett's manager, Conrad Riggs, said the ''Destination Mir''
idea has been well received by television networks, though no deals
have been signed.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is extremely high interest, everybody wants it,'' Riggs
said. ''Obviously all the networks want to be in business with
Mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnett could not be reached for comment Friday, but Riggs
predicted that both filming and airing of the show could begin by
the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   A previous attempt by MirCorp to put a paying customer in orbit
ended in embarrassment when the candidate -- British businessman
Peter Llewelyn -- turned out not to be the multimillionaire he
claimed to be. But MirCorp President Jeffrey Manber was
enthusiastic about ''Destination Mir,'' saying the show would quiet
skeptics of his Netherlands-based company.
</P>
<P>
   Manber said MirCorp has already gotten approval for the show
from its majority shareholder, Russia's state-owned Energia
company, which owns and runs Mir. Energia owns 60 percent of
MirCorp, while private investors own the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think every person around the world will be glued to the TV
set,'' Manber said. ''We think this is going to be hotter than
'Survivor.'''
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor'' is the hit reality-TV show that placed 16
contestants on a desert island near the Malaysian section of Borneo
and let them vote each other out. The last one left wins $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   Manber called Burnett ''the most respected, successful guy in
reality-TV. He can do anything he wants for his next project.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is one of MirCorp's many plans for Mir, including an
Internet project, a film and a flow of well-heeled ''space
tourists.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, MirCorp has helped pay for a 73-day manned mission to
perform maintenance and rehabilitate the station. In 2001 it is
tentatively planning to send up its first tourist, former rocket
scientist Dennis Tito -- if Russian experts decide he's fit.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman at Energia said Russian officials would guarantee
that anyone who goes to Mir would undergo intense fitness tests.
Still, there have been questions about the safety of Mir, which
suffered an onboard fire, a near-fatal collision with a supply
module and thousands of minor breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Both Manber and Riggs said they had no doubts about the
station's reliability.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mantra of MirCorp is that first off, the Mir is in far
better shape than it was three years ago,'' Manber said. ''We say
there is nothing wrong with the Mir space station that money cannot
fix.''

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 7, Rangers 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Carl Everett homered twice and matched a
career high with five RBIs, leading the Boston Red Sox over the
Texas Rangers 7-3 on a hot Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   On a night where the gametime temperature was 98, Rangers
starter Ryan Glynn briefly lost consciousness in the dugout during
the fifth was taken to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie right-hander was down for about five minutes, then
regained consciousness as he was wheeled from the dugout strapped
to a gurney and taken to an ambulance. The game was halted for 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn, who threw 95 pitches, allowed seven runs and eight hits
in 4 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Everett had a two-run homer in the fourth and a three-run drive
in the fifth, both off Glynn (3-2), for the 11th multihomer game of
his career, his second this season. Everett raised his season
home-run total to 29.
</P>
<P>
   Boston has won two straight after losing four in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' Gabe Kapler stretched his hitting streak to 24 games with
an eighth-inning single off Rheal Cormier, matching the club record
set by Mickey Rivers in 1980. Kapler, who went 1-for-5, also
matched Arizona's Tony Womack for the longest streak in the majors
this season
</P>
<P>
   Rolando Arrojo (1-1) won for the first time in eight starts
since June 26, when he was with the Colorado Rockies. Arrojo
allowed two runs and four hits in seven innings. He had lost his
last four decisions for the Rockies and his first for the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Haselman's homer put Texas ahead in the second, but Boston
took a 3-1 lead in the fourth on Everett's homer and Brian
Daubach's run-scoring, double-play grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Boston made it 7-1 in the fifth on Trot Nixon's RBI single and
Everett's second homer.
</P>
<P>
   Royce Clayton tripled in the bottom half and scored on Luis
Alicea's groundout. Ricky Ledee hit an RBI single in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Rangers returned home from a 2-5 road trip. ... Glynn
was hospitalized overnight for observation and tests. The Rangers
said they would have no additional news on Glynn's condition until
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Calif. To Call For Power Cutbacks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Temperatures over 100 degrees and increased
air conditioner use strained the region's power system Friday,
prompting a Stage Two power alert in which commercial users were
asked to cut back.
</P>
<P>
   A Stage Two Emergency is triggered when power reserves drop to
below 5 percent. The Independent System Operator, the agency in
charge of California's power grid, asked commercial users to
voluntarily cut back on power use from 4:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   A Stage Three Emergency -- when power reserves drop to below 1&AMP;frac12;
percent -- would include mandatory rolling power outages for all
customers.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Alberto Gains Strength  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Alberto, the first hurricane of the Atlantic
season, was expected to swing northward and intensify slightly as
it churned over open seas Friday, but forecasters predicted it
would stay far from land.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto has been moving northwesterly, and forecasters said it
will pass well east of Bermuda. At 11 p.m. Friday, Alberto was
about 475 miles east northeast of Bermuda, moving north northeast
at 18 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane had sustained winds Friday night of 110 mph.
Forecasters expected Alberto would taper off and become a standard
storm system over cooler north Atlantic waters this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''The forecast is for slight strengthening in the short term and
weakening after 36 hours as colder water is encountered,'' Miles
Lawrence, a hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center
in Miami, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto had returned to hurricane strength Wednesday after
briefly weakening to a tropical storm.
</P>
<P>
   Another smaller system forecasters had been watching east of
Florida tapered off Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through November
30, peaking around Labor Day. Noted hurricane expert William Gray
is predicting 11 named storms, seven hurricanes and three major
hurricanes this year.

<P>
   BOULDER, Mont. (AP) -- With too many fires and not enough
firefighters, the Montana university system told student
firefighters Friday they can report for fall classes three weeks
late if they stay on the fire lines.
</P>
<P>
   ''These students are putting themselves at risk to protect our
environment, and it is appropriate that we assist them in their
efforts,'' said Richard Crofts, state commissioner of higher
education.
</P>
<P>
   The dangers became all too real Friday for firefighters in
Wyoming, where a wind-fuel wildfire engulfed a truck, killing one
firefighter and burning another on the Wind River Indian
Reservation.
</P>
<P>
   It was the sixth firefighter death involving U.S. wildfires this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The two firefighters were the only crew members fighting a
portion of a blaze in the Owl Creek Mountains, said Perry Baker of
the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Strong winds had pushed flames out of control, forcing
firefighters to back off a 25,000-acre fire and a 5,000-acre fire,
both burning in the sparsely populated area of central Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Across the West on Friday, large fires were burning on more than
900,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters have joined the effort from throughout the United
States and Canada. Military troops are on fire duty, and retired
fire managers have been asked to return. In Idaho, where fires are
burning on more than 423,280 acres, 79 firefighters from Australia
and New Zealand will join the crews this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In Montana, an estimated 1,800 students firefighters, including
National Guard members and volunteers, are expected to qualify for
the late start to the fall semester, a university official said.
</P>
<P>
   Classes are scheduled to start Sept. 5 at the University of
Montana, but student firefighters will have until Sept. 25 to
register, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   More fires were started by lightning late Thursday and early
Friday across the region.
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service said there were 2,200 known lightning strikes
in the southwestern area of Montana and in neighboring Idaho. In
northwestern Montana, the Kootenai National Forest had 70 new fires
sparked by lightning, but only 18 firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   Managers in Montana pulled all crews from a 3,050-acre fire near
here to fight the bigger and more threatening High Ore Road fire
that forced the evacuation of homes in the Jefferson City area and
swept through the settlement of Wickes.
</P>
<P>
   The fire also knocked out two huge power transmission lines that
feed into the Pacific Northwest's power grid. Power supply has not
been interrupted, but the lines will be out of service through
Monday to allow for repairs.
</P>
<P>
   In the southern Bitterroot Valley, tempers flared Friday when
U.S. Forest Service officials met with about 270 residents, some of
whom accused firefighters of incompetence for setting a backfire
that burned their houses.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was careless disregard for life. It was arson and attempted
murder,'' said Joan Giles. Her house and about a dozen others
burned Sunday when fires blew up south of Darby.
</P>
<P>
   Forest Service officials promised an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   East of town, a complex of fires continued to burn out of
control in the drought-parched Bitterroot National Forest.
Altogether, fires in area have destroyed more than 50 homes and
covered more than 175,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   In Hamilton, about 600 people remain out of their homes because
of a 7,600-fire that was just 30 percent contained, and more
residents near Darby were forced from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, there were signs of progress Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Fire managers in New Mexico and Oregon reported all major fires
contained. In California, the 11,734-acre Pechanga Indian
reservation fire was contained late Thursday, and firefighters were
standing by in case the 74,439-acre Manter fire flared from high
wind.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, the Bureau of Land Management and other federal
agencies banned open campfires, charcoal fires, fireworks, outside
smoking and the use of equipment that could produce sparks on all
federal land.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have reached a turning point in an unprecedented fire
season where firefighting needs have exceeded available
resources,'' Ann Morgan, BLM state director, said Friday. ''We
cannot afford a human-caused fire in Colorado.''

<HEADLINE> Forgotten Prisoner Returns Home  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX BANDY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) -- After five decades in a Russian mental
hospital, an elderly Hungarian is back in his homeland for the
first time since he was sent to the Russian front in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Andras Tamas, 75, showed no emotion as the Hungarian airliner
that brought him from Moscow landed Friday evening at Budapest, a
city he had not seen since the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, all he wanted to know was when he would get a new leg
to replace one amputated three years ago, according to Dr. Akos
Barth, a Hungarian psychiatrist who accompanied him from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we landed, I told him, 'Look, we are back in Hungary,'''
Barth said. ''But there was no emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Tamas' arrival in Budapest marked the end of a strange and
tragic saga that spans more than half a century, most of it spent
in virtual isolation among people with whom he could not even
communicate.
</P>
<P>
   Until he was taken Friday by bus to Moscow's airport, Tamas had
not set foot outside the hospital in the Russian town of Kotelnich
since Soviet secret police brought him there in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   He is believed to have been among the 150,000 Hungarian troops
who fought under Nazi command at the Don River in 1944. According
to Russian records, Tamas was among prisoners of war sent by train
from western Russia to a prison camp in Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed to be suffering from psychological problems, so guards
took him off the train when it passed near Kotelnich and left him
at the hospital, where he was forgotten. For years, no one knew who
he was, and hospital staff mistook his Hungarian for gibberish.
</P>
<P>
   An encounter with a Hungarian-speaking Russian unlocked the
mystery. A Hungarian psychiatrist, Dr. Andras Veer, visited him in
the hospital and came away convinced Tamas was Hungarian.
</P>
<P>
   Hungarian authorities decided to issue him a passport and bring
him home, even though no record of his birth has been found.
Isolated from fellow Hungarians for so long, Tamas has forgotten
most details of his early life, including the name of his mother,
Hungarian authorities say.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he is among other Hungarians, doctors hope he will
slowly regain his memory.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people -- including a few elderly Hungarians who
suspected Tamas might be a missing relative -- jammed the arrival
hall at Budapest airport late Friday to catch a glimpse of the man
Hungarian media have called ''the last prisoner of World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   Tamas was whisked through the hall in a wheelchair and taken to
the National Psychological and Neurological Institute, where he is
expected to remain for at least two months.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said he would be placed in a semi-private room with
other patients in hopes the contact with Hungarians would help
restore his memory.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to be very careful to make sure he becomes accustomed
to modern life gradually,'' said Veer, director of the psychiatric
institute. He said several families said Tamas might be a relative
''but all of this will have to be checked out.''
</P>
<P>
   If Tamas is not settled with family members, he will be sent to
a state-run home for the elderly, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But even if any of Tamas' relatives are still alive, it is
uncertain whether they still live in Hungary. Many ethnic
Hungarians live in countries such as Slovakia, Romania and
Yugoslavia, and hundreds of thousands fled the country during the
1956 Hungarian uprising against Soviet domination.

<HEADLINE> Child Protection in War Zones Sought  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council, echoing concerns
raised last month by Secretary-General Kofi Annan, is calling for
better protection for children in war zones -- from girls who are
sexually exploited to boys who are recruited for combat.
</P>
<P>
   Ambassadors unanimously adopted a resolution calling for
governments to ratify key treaties protecting children and urging
governments and rebel groups to respect international laws that
safeguard the young.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution urges member states to protect and help refugees
and displaced persons, many of whom are children. It also asks
countries to provide children with ways to reintegrate once the
fighting ends.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations estimates that about 300,000 children have
been recruited, mostly by rebel groups, to fight wars from Sierra
Leone to Sri Lanka. Two million children were killed, 6 million
injured and 1 million orphaned by war between 1986 and 1996,
according to UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
   Many who survive are orphaned or become heads of their
households, the resolution noted.
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF hailed the resolution, saying the Security Council has
''reminded the world that it is both immoral and illegal to make
children the victims and protagonists of war.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution stems from Annan's report last month that
includes 55 proposals to protect children in war zones. The
proposals cover the recruitment of children into armies, the risk
of their being harmed by land mines and their suffering under
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Annan asked countries that support rebel factions -- with
military, political financial or other aid -- to require that rebels
comply with international norms as a condition of assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of Annan's recommendations were included in the
resolution, but the Security Council did agree to consider the
consequences sanctions have on children. The council has come under
fire for a decade of sanctions in Iraq, which have led to the
deaths of thousands of children.

<HEADLINE> Chile Democracy To Withstand Pinochet  </HEADLINE>
By EDUARDO GALLARDO
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Far from threatening its democracy,
tensions over the legal troubles facing former dictator Gen.
Augusto Pinochet are a sign of Chile's growing political maturity,
its government says.
</P>
<P>
   Chileans should be proud of how the nation has been able to
advance in bringing the once all-powerful general to task for human
rights abuses during his regime, according to President Ricardo
Lagos.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court last week stripped Pinochet of his legal
immunity by a 14-6 margin, opening the possibility of trying him in
Chile on human rights charges.
</P>
<P>
   The situation -- unthinkable only a few years back -- ''is a clear
demonstration that the country is transiting through a new era of
firm democracy,'' government spokesman Claudio Huepe said.
</P>
<P>
   Top military brass and rightists, who remain loyal to Pinochet,
paraded to Pinochet's heavily guarded suburban Santiago mansion
after the ruling to express their solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   The government called the military's support for its former
leader as ''an understandable gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Why do they wait until now, when he is old, ill and has lost
his power?'' Pinochet's wife, Lucia Hiriart, asked in a speech to
women supporting her husband.
</P>
<P>
   But fears the court's ruling would threaten the country's
democracy or provoke a violent military backlash have not been
realized. Acceptance of the ruling has been virtually unanimous,
although grudging at times.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet ''will do whatever the law mandates him to do,'' said
his lawyer, Pablo Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   His relatives and associates have said from the start that they
would accept the decision and continue their fight in the country's
courts.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a politically motivated ruling, but in a democracy it
must be accepted,'' said right-wing congressman Alberto Cardemil.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Israel, a political scientist at the University of
Chile, said the country is belatedly dealing with a situation it
should have faced a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''But it is doing so with tremendous stability,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the military has accepted the trial and jailing of
other top-ranking officers on human rights charges in the past,
Israel said that ''if some incident happens, it will be an isolated
incident that would be quickly brought under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Popular reaction was also moderate. A few hundred supporters and
foes of the general held peaceful and brief demonstrations. Opinion
polls showed a majority of Chileans supported the removal of
Pinochet's immunity.
</P>
<P>
   The political consequences of the case, however, appear more
complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Government efforts to rid Chile of the legal legacy from the
Pinochet era will likely come under attack as angry Pinochet
supporters harden their opposition in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The government needs the support of the right-wing opposition to
pass key bills, and in recent months the government and the
opposition had made progress in negotiations aimed at amending the
1980 constitution written by the Pinochet regime.
</P>
<P>
   The main changes sought by the government are the elimination of
nine Senate seats that are appointed instead of elected and the
restoration of full presidential authority over the military,
including power to fire its commanders.
</P>
<P>
   But talks appeared dead in the wake of the Pinochet ruling as
the opposition showed its power in Congress by denying quorum for
the first session scheduled after the court decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''The opposition has gotten really angry, so I guess we will
have to wait until the anger fades,'' said Interior Minister Jose
Miguel Insulza.
</P>
<P>
   The imprisonment of Pinochet, who ruled Chile from 1973 to 1990,
is not imminent.
</P>
<P>
   If judge Juan Guzman, who will handle the case, actually opens a
trial, it should take years to conclude, and even his staunchest
foes admit they do not see him ever being sentenced, much less
jailed.

<HEADLINE> Tire Recall Said Not To Harm Sales  </HEADLINE>
By JIM SUHR
<TEXT>
<P>
   The service garage in Jerry Reynolds' Dallas-area Prestige Ford
resembles a frenzied pit lane these days, from the constant whine
of lugnut drills to the feverish pace of crews in 56 bays replacing
recalled tires on Ford Explorers.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds doesn't find the crush too surprising -- or the fact
that shoppers in his showroom Friday still were interested in
buying new Explorers.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after Bridgestone/Firestone Inc.'s recall of 6.5
million tires -- most of them on Ford SUVs and light trucks --
Explorer sales appear unaffected, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see it having any effect on SUV sales, period -- on any
make or any brand. People who want them want them,'' Reynolds said
from his dealership in Garland, Texas. ''It appears to the public
that it's an isolated Firestone problem, not a Ford one.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Center for Auto Safety, though, Clarence Ditlow isn't
convinced. He says the tire recall further highlights safety
concerns about SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   ''When one looks back three to four years from now, this may
well turn out to be a crucial factor in SUV sales,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 9,500 people are killed every year in rollover crashes,
according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
More than 60 percent of fatalities in SUVs and more than 40 percent
of deaths in pickup trucks occur in rollovers, compared to 22
percent of car deaths.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Ford said an electronic system meant to prevent
rollovers will soon be offered as an option in SUVs and pickup
trucks. The systems, which use sensors to keep a vehicle from
uncontrollably spinning, are widespread in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Ford spokesman Terry Bresnihan wouldn't speculate about whether
the tire recall could affect the company's SUV sales. But he said
government studies have put the Explorer ''among the safest SUVs in
the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The Explorer was one of the vehicles that whetted America's
appetite for SUVs. Ford sold 428,772 Explorers last year, 128,000
more than the nearest competitor, Jeep Grand Cherokee.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. announced the voluntary recall
Wednesday involving radial ATX, radial ATX II and Wilderness AT
brand tires, which are standard equipment on some Ford SUVs and
light trucks. The government is investigating the tires in more
than 300 accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone/Firestone spokesman Ken Fields noted that the
company recalled the tires voluntarily even before the
investigation was complete.
</P>
<P>
   ''We responded quickly to demonstrate that safety is our top
priority,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   James Aikens, shopping at Detroit's Riverside Ford, said the
tire recall won't discourage SUV buyers. His advice: ''Just don't
buy a Ford with Firestone tires on it, or take the Firestones off
and get a different tire.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's just what shoppers are doing, at least at Reynolds'
Texas dealership, where he said consumers often are agreeing to buy
Explorers if the tires -- in many cases not among those being
recalled -- are replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm hearing that all over the country,'' said Reynolds, who
also heads the Ford National Dealer Council. ''Customers are
saying, 'I feel good and safe with Explorers, but I won't buy one
with Firestone tires.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Reynolds' repair shop on Saturday will begin
indefinitely devoting its time to swapping tires.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has authorized nearly 3,000 dealers running out of
replacement tires to use tires from Firestone competitors Goodyear,
Michelin, General and Uniroyal, the Detroit Free Press reported in
Saturday editions.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's move sidesteps Firestone's plan to spread the recall over
12 months, and apparently leaves the tire manufacturer responsible
for paying the warranty bills of Ford dealers who put its
competitors' products on Explorers and other light trucks.

<HEADLINE> New York man convicted in 1995 murder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FAYETTEVILLE, W.Va. (AP) - A New York man accused of killing a
bar owner has been convicted of second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   A Fayette County Circuit Court jury deliberated three hours
Friday before finding Miguel A. Quinones, 22, guilty in the 1995
shooting death of Christopher Dennis Reardon, 49, of Oak Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Reardon, who had owned bars in Beckley and Mount Hope, was found
shot to death June 19, 1995, in his van, which had pushed into a
creek. His head had been encased in a plastic bag.
</P>
<P>
   Quinones was the third of three New York men arrested for
Reardon's murder. Damien Bagut had earlier pleaded guilty to
second-degree murder and Miguel Angel Gonzales was convicted of
accessory after the fact. Quinones was 17 and both Bagut and
Gonzales were 16 at the time of the murder.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Reardon was shot in a house where the three
youths were dealing crack cocaine.

<HEADLINE> Spies' Convictions Upheld in Court  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A federal appeals court on Friday upheld
the espionage convictions of two spies for the former East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
unanimously upheld the October 1998 convictions of former Pentagon
lawyer Theresa Maria Squillacote and her husband, Kurt Alan Stand,
a former labor union representative. She was sentenced to 21 years
and 10 months in prison; he was sentenced to 17 years and six
months.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had described the Washington, D.C., couple as
dedicated communists who hated the United States and were willing
to spy for any country.
</P>
<P>
   They said the couple helped set up a spy ring for the former
East Germany and passed classified documents to an FBI agent they
thought was a South African intelligence officer. The two were
caught in 1997 after the FBI learned of their attempts to contact
the Communist Party in South Africa.

<HEADLINE> NTSB Releases EgyptAir Reports  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The terrifying last moments of EgyptAir Flight
990 show the captain battling in vain to save his plane and the 217
people aboard -- a struggle that probably will add to the debate
over what caused the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Co-pilot Gameel El-Batouty was at the controls when the Boeing
767 nosed into its fatal dive into the Atlantic Ocean. Some
investigators have speculated he crashed the plane deliberately.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian authorities have denied that suggestion, and they
insisted that the transcript of the cockpit voice recorder,
released Friday, helps exonerate El-Batouty.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is nothing on the cockpit voice recorder or the flight
data recorder to indicate that Flight 990 was intentionally
crashed,'' said Capt. Shaker Kelada of EgyptAir.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board released 1,665 pages of
fact-finding reports into the crash, routine in such major
investigations. The reports set forth what has been learned so far,
but do not provide analysis or suggest a probable cause.
</P>
<P>
   ''The evidence overwhelmingly contradicts an intent to destroy
the aircraft,'' said Carl Vogt, a former NTSB chairman now serving
as a consultant to EgyptAir.
</P>
<P>
   The conversations between El-Batouty and the pilot, Capt.
Mahmoud el-Habashy are ''consistent with two guys trying to solve a
problem,'' Vogt said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pull! Pull with me! Pull with me! Pull with me!'' el-Habashy
cried as he fought to pull out of a dive during the plane's last
moments before it plunged into the Atlantic Ocean off Nantucket
Island, Mass., last Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ''I rely on God,'' El-Batouty said several times, a phrase
Islamic leaders say indicates he was seeking God's assistance in
solving the problem.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB Chairman James Hall stressed in making the records public
that the cause remains under investigation. He also noted the board
will hold no public hearing, because its investigators ''believe
there are no unresolved safety issues that require such a forum.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall has testified before Congress that the movements of the
plane were ''consistent with a deliberate action on the part of one
of the crew members.''
</P>
<P>
   The speculation that El-Batouty crashed the plane followed news
leaks early in the investigation indicating that when left alone in
the cockpit, he made a comment, followed by a prayer, before the
plane went into a dive.
</P>
<P>
   The board doesn't make public tape recordings from cockpits, and
El-Batouty's comment after el-Habashy left the cockpit is not
resolved by the transcript released Friday. That transcript noted a
dispute among the investigators over what was said:
</P>
<P>
   ''The five Arabic-speaking members of the group concur that they
do not recognize this as an Arabic word, words or phrase. The
entire group agrees that three syllables are heard, and the accent
is on the second syllable. Four Arabic-speaking group members
believe that they heard words similar to 'control it.' One
English-speaking member believes he heard a word similar to
'hydraulic.' The five other members believe that the word(s) were
unintelligible.''
</P>
<P>
   What was made clear by the transcripts was el-Habashy's surprise
on finding his plane in a dive as he returned from a trip to the
lavatory and his battle to right the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's happening?'' the captain asked. ''What's happening,
Gamil? What's happening?''
</P>
<P>
   ''What is this? Did you shut the engines?'' asked el-Habashy,
who then struggled to pull his plane out of the dive. The
transcript did not show an immediate response from El-Batouty.
About 90 seconds later, the captain exhorted: ''Pull with me!'' And
then the transcript ends.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder shows that the plane's autopilot was
switched off, and just seconds before el-Habashy asked about the
engines, first the right, then the left engine lever was switched
from ''run'' to ''cutoff.''
</P>
<P>
   Vogt, the EgyptAir consultant, said reducing engine power is the
correct thing to do if a plane suddenly noses over into a dive.
</P>
<P>
   ''Reducing power is an act to maintain controllability of an
aircraft,'' he said. ''It is evidence, in my mind as a pilot, that
this pilot was trying to control the airplane. ... He was trying to
fly the airplane and maintain airspeed, not let it get excessive.''
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder indicates that the engines were shut
down about 15 seconds after the elevator moved and pushed the
plane's nose into a dive.
</P>
<P>
   Hall acknowledged continuing areas of friction between U.S. and
Egyptian authorities. ''Where they have disagreements, they have
been allowed to submit them in writing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mohsen el Missiry, head of the Egyptian group assisting in the
investigation, appeared with Hall. He said he believes ''additional
work remains to be done, particularly in the assessing the design
of the Boeing 767 elevator control system and gaining additional
radar information, before the cause of this tragic accident can be
finally determined.''

<HEADLINE> Hobos Gather in Iowa  </HEADLINE>
By KEN THOMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRITT, Iowa (AP) -- They tapped their walking sticks and brushed
their fingertips along the tops the headstones that marked the
simple graves of their brethren, men like Mountain Dew, Lord Open
Road and Hobo Herb Schaber.
</P>
<P>
   While a flutist played ''The Wayfaring Stranger,'' the
procession of 75 hobos and family members bowed their heads and
walked silently in respect to a generation of migrant workers, men
and women who shared a passion for freedom and the open railroad.
</P>
<P>
   ''Part of your spirit, part of your love will go through the
walking stick and into the people who are buried here,'' said Texas
Madman, who led the graveside memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 people, many dressed in denim and burlap, gathered at
the sun-splashed Evergreen Cemetery Friday, marking a somber moment
during the 100th National Hobo Convention in this north-central
Iowa town of 2,200.
</P>
<P>
   While many Americans associate hobos with the long-gone days of
the Great Depression, hobos and townspeople alike are hoping to
keep the history of the transient workers alive.
</P>
<P>
   About 20,000 tourists are expected to descend upon the town this
weekend for carnival rides, tastes of Mulligan Stew and the
coronation of this year's Hobo King and Queen.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is such a timepiece of Americana,'' said Rick Palieri, a
musician from Hinesburg, Vt. ''This kind of thing is disappearing
so quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The festival came to this small town along U.S. Highway 18 in
1900 when three Chicago hobos sought a small town to hold the
annual gathering of Tourist Union No. 63, better known as the Hobo
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   While the town has provided a stronger police presence in recent
years, community members said they have welcomed the hobos and
tourists with open arms.
</P>
<P>
   Crimson banners depicting a friendly hobo carrying a bindle
stick decorate Main Avenue while The Hobo Museum and Gift Shop
features a collection of photographs and a replica of a ''Hobo
Jungle'' shack. Many residents also work with the Hobo Memorial
Foundation, a charitable group dedicated to preserving the history
of the hobo.
</P>
<P>
   Today's generation of transients -- many who take extended
railroad trips during the summer months or mirror the lifestyle in
vans or RVs -- concede that a reduced dependency on manual labor and
an increase in danger along the railways have made the lifestyle
less appealing.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, with more than 95 percent of the nation fully
employed, they say the wanderlust of the post-Depression era may be
over.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're a long way off from the cartoon tramp,'' said Captain
Cloud, a Tennessee worker who carries on his shoulder a 3-year-old
iguana named Mojo. ''There's a lot of us out here that's trying to
maintain a piece of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Errol Lincoln Uys, author of ''Riding the Rails,'' a collection
of letters about teen-aged hobos during the Great Depression, said
as many as 250,000 teen-agers and 4 million adults turned to a life
of migrant labor along the railways between 1929 and the start of
World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Uys said the current generation frequently mistakes hobos for
homeless. Historians believe the term ''hobo'' came from ''hoe
boy,'' a term for a traveling laborer who would work in rural
settings for weeks at a time before jumping a freight train for the
next locale.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to ask yourself, in today's context, in the suburbs,
how many people, if a hobo comes down the driveway and knocks on
the door, would not reach for the telephone and not dial 911?'' Uys
said.
</P>
<P>
   But others insist the torch will be passed to a generation of
thrill-seekers and freedom addicts who wish to make the road their
home without the restrictions of a 9-to-5 job.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's something that's going to endure and it's going to endure
in another form,'' said Chris Smith, a University of Chicago
graduate student researching migratory workers and the nation's
tradition of hobos.
</P>
<P>
   Not all hobos are represented in Britt. Buzz Potter, president
of the National Hobo Association, said many of his members decided
not to attend the event because they resented the police presence
and the tourist atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the hobos in attendance said they planned to
continue to visit Iowa each August for the convention -- and
eventually find their eternal reward.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm all set,'' said Red Bird, a Pennsburg, Pa., truck driver,
pointing to the blank marble grave stone at the Evergreen Cemetery.
''All I have to do is die now.''

<HEADLINE> Linba Denies Money For Hostages  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- A Libyan envoy on Saturday denied
reports his country offered $25 million in ransom for European and
Asian hostages being held by a Muslim rebel group in the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul Rajab Azzarouq, Libya's former ambassador to the
Philippines, was reacting to reports last week in Beirut that Libya
had made the offer.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no truth to that. Our offer, which we talked about,
is a socio-economic package for livelihood projects,'' said
Azzarouq, who has been involved in negotiations to free the
captives held by the Abu Sayyaf rebels on Jolo island.
</P>
<P>
   The chief government negotiator, Robert Aventajado, also denied
the reports. But he said Libya has been involved in livelihood
projects for Muslim communities in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   The leading Beirut daily An-Nahar said in a report Aug. 5 that
Seif al-Islam, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's son, sent an
emissary to Manila to try for a deal.
</P>
<P>
   It said the envoy, Mohamad Ismail, contacted the Lebanese
Embassy in Tokyo and expressed ''full readiness'' to pay a ransom
of $1 million to gain the release of Marie Moarbes, a
Lebanese-French woman, as a first priority. The report also said
Libya would then pay $24 million for the liberation of the other
hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Ismail, who is helping Azzarouq, also denied the report.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's rubbish,'' he said, adding that it would be illogical to
give more than what the kidnappers had asked for.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf has demanded $1 million for each of the nine
Western hostages still in their hands -- two Germans, two Finns,
Moarbes, two other French, and two South Africans. The rebels are
also holding three French television journalists, three Malaysians
and two Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
   The Beirut newspaper said that under the deal the hostages would
be encouraged to travel to Libya to thank the leadership for its
mediation, a media show that Tripoli would use to improve its
international standing.
</P>
<P>
   Azzarouq said he has not heard of any plan to fly hostages to
Libya.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Philippine Air Transportation Office said it had
received an inquiry from the Libyan embassy on flying a plane from
Libya, although no request for a permit has been made. Azzarouq
said he was not informed of the embassy's call.
</P>
<P>
   Since he became ruler in 1969, Gadhafi has been supportive of
Muslim, nationalist and leftist rebel groups around the world. He
has a long history of ties with Muslim rebels in the southern
Philippines, having provided development aid and tried to help
negotiate peace agreements between rebels and the Philippine
government.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf is a loose collection of several hundred armed
Muslim rebels blamed by authorities for numerous attacks against
Christians in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   The group seized 21 hostages on April 23 from Sipadan island, a
Malaysian diving resort, and brought them to Jolo by boat. A German
woman and six Malaysians have since been released.

<HEADLINE> Bush Calls Clinton Embarrassing  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   EVERETT, Wash. (AP) -- Raising his right hand, George W. Bush
promises to add a personal vow to his presidential oath of office,
a vow to restore honor and integrity to the White House. That
pledge has an edge.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential nominee sharpened it by raising the
White House sex scandal as a campaign topic, saying President
Clinton had ''embarrassed the nation'' in the Monica Lewinsky
affair.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that since Vice President Al Gore, his Democratic
opponent, is promising a fresh start, he should tell the voters
where he differs with Clinton on policy and ''everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If he's got a problem with what went on in the past, he ought
to explain what it is,'' the Texas governor said.
</P>
<P>
   With those comments aboard his campaign jet Friday, Bush
directly, but still cautiously, raised the scandal as a talking
point in his campaign against Gore. Bush said he did not intend to
make an issue of the Clinton scandal, although by discussing it he
effectively did so. He also said he was not suggesting that Gore
condoned the president's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the election is about the future, not about the past.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona, campaigning with Bush, said the
same. He said the important issue is ''vision for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The other stuff is of secondary importance to the American
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But even as a secondary concern, weariness and lingering
resentment of Clinton would be an asset for Bush against Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president sharply rebuked Clinton for the affair in a
television interview 14 months ago. ''What he did was
inexcusable,'' Gore said on ABC. He said the president had lied to
him about it, as he lied to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton revived the subject himself with a public confessional
to a convention of clergymen in suburban Chicago on Thursday. He
spoke of his efforts to rebuild his personal life after his
''terrible mistake'' in the affair that led to his impeachment in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Gore noted that Clinton had said much the same thing before. By
saying them as he headed for the Democratic National Convention in
Los Angeles, Clinton stirred the subject when the Gore campaign
would prefer to forget it.
</P>
<P>
   That gave Bush an opening to remind people of the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   It has been there by indirection in the final lines of his
campaign speeches since he became a candidate. Closing a rally at
the University of Portland on Friday, Bush gave the familiar
gesture, the upraised right hand.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I put my hand on the Bible on that day in January 2001, I
will swear to uphold the laws of the land,'' he said. ''But I will
also swear to uphold the honor and the integrity of the office to
which I have been elected, so help me God.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., said Bush will become the first
Republican to carry the state since Ronald Reagan because
''Oregonians are tired of the ring in the bathtub'' and want honor
and dignity restored.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday in California, McCain joined the man who defeated
him for the GOP nomination for a three-day campaign swing up the
coast.
</P>
<P>
   They were flying on Saturday to Arizona, where Bush and his
wife, Laura, will be overnight guests of the senator and Mrs.
McCain at their ranch in Sedona. McCain said he will barbecue them
a dinner of chicken and ribs.

<HEADLINE> Gore Makes Environmental Stop  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Al Gore is making a highly personal trip to
his environmental roots, hoping to ease concern among critics that
he has lost his fervor for protecting the air and water.
</P>
<P>
   Aides insist that Gore's commitment has remained consistent, and
he'll renew that vow with a tour of the homestead of author Rachel
Carson, whose 1962 classic ''Silent Spring'' launched what has
become the modern environmental movement.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, awaiting the Democratic presidential
nomination, was talking up his environmental record Saturday, even
as he called for more.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm proud that even though we have far more to do, we now have
the cleanest air and water in a generation,'' Gore said in remarks
prepared for the event.
</P>
<P>
   ''Throughout his career, Al Gore has been taking on polluters to
clean up our air and water,'' said spokesman Doug Hattaway.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was headed to Springdale and a tour of Carson's modest
homestead, hoping to send an environmental signal. He planned to
announce no new policy proposals, but his appearance acknowledges a
thorny political problem he faces from the left.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was making his environmental case in the strongest terms,
calling for ''a future where the smog of cities doesn't choke our
kids and block the afternoon sun.''
</P>
<P>
   He was stumping without his running mate, Connecticut Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, for the first time since his selection. Lieberman
went home to observe the Jewish Sabbath, and won't be campaigning
from sunset on Fridays until sunset on Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   Even before he arrived at the event, Gore was turning his
attention to the environment, focusing on global warming at a
fund-raiser in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''With some, it's still controversial,'' said Gore. ''I really
don't know why because Mother Nature is insistent making the point
that we're really going to have to wake up and do something about
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore argued the nation should seize the opportunity, and begin
developing cleaner technology to market in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Going to less-polluting technologies can position our
industries to lead the world in this century as we did in the
last,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The environment was one of the first issues Gore took on when he
entered Congress, and his book ''Earth in the Balance'' is an
argument for environmental activism.
</P>
<P>
   Republican critics cite passages from that book to suggest that
Gore's an environmental radical who wants to do such things as
eliminate the internal combustion engine and increase gasoline
prices. Gore rejects those assertions.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Gore has come under fire from the left,
particularly from Green Party candidate Ralph Nader. Those critics
say that Gore has been stung by criticism of his book, and has
backed away from environmental activism.
</P>
<P>
   By paying homage to environmental pioneer Carson, Gore hopes to
answer that criticism by linking himself to the author of the book
that first raised questions about the wide use of chemicals in food
production and the impact of those chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Carson taught zoology at the University of Maryland in the
1930s, and had long service with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service. Though she's best known by ''Silent Spring,'' she also
wrote ''The Sea Around Us'' which examines water pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Hattaway argued that Gore can draw sharp distinctions with rival
George W. Bush on the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaigned his way toward next week's Democratic National
Convention in Los Angeles as officials disclosed his daughter,
Karenna Gore Schiff, would deliver one of three nominating speeches
for the vice president on Wednesday night. The other two will be by
Lois DeBerry, a friend of the vice president and a member of the
Tennessee Legislature, and actor Tommy Lee Jones, a Harvard
classmate of Gore's.

<HEADLINE> USC Buys Downtown Hotel  </HEADLINE>
By ERICA WERNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Some of the prime accommodations at the
Democratic National Convention are being offered by the University
of Southern California, south-central LA's newest real estate
mogul.
</P>
<P>
   The private, richly endowed university paid $26 million for a
240-room high-rise Radisson Hotel across from its campus this
month, the latest example of universities in blighted urban areas
moving beyond their borders with social outreach and real estate
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   USC, which has 28,000 students and an endowment of $1.5 billion,
occupies a 150-acre campus surrounded by neighborhoods that in
recent decades have been among Los Angeles' most notorious. The
campus afforded a front-row view of the 1992 riots. But while other
downtown institutions have fled west, the university has refused to
budge from its 120-year-old home.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're an urban university,'' said Bing Cherrie, USC's
associate vice president for planning. ''We've had several real
estate developers in our history try to woo us out, and our
trustees have always said no.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not unusual for wealthy universities to own hotels near
campus. In the past decade Harvard developed a posh hotel in
Harvard Square and Yale purchased a bed and breakfast that was in
danger of decline.
</P>
<P>
   Like the University of Pennsylvania, which transformed a West
Philadelphia parking lot into an upscale shopping center, or
Trinity College in Hartford, Conn., which spent hundreds of
thousands of dollars to buy and tear down crack houses, USC has
begun to take an active role in its environment.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters hope next week's Democratic convention will both
showcase and promote that effort.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people don't quite understand and think a university
is strictly academics doing research. But in many cases when you
have a university in an inner-city area they wear many hats,'' said
Jack Kyser, chief economist with the Los Angeles County Economic
Development Corp. ''They're there forever, so they're protecting
their interests and probably taking a longer-range look.''
</P>
<P>
   USC's purchase of the hotel follows a similar one a year ago of
a nearby shopping center that includes a movie theater and a drug
store. The university paid $25 million for the complex.
</P>
<P>
   The university, meanwhile, has poured resources into five local
public schools and sent campus police on patrol in the
south-central community that borders the campus. Crime has fallen
and property values are up.
</P>
<P>
   USC's real estate acquisitions were long viewed suspiciously by
residents fearful that the university was interested only in its
own property values and not in the low-income, working-class
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism fit in with USC's reputation as an academically
lightweight school for rich, white kids -- the University of Spoiled
Children.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a history of redevelopment in this neighborhood, and
USC's been the principal beneficiary,'' said Sandra McNeill of the
Figueroa Corridor Coalition for Economic Justice, a coalition
representing more than a dozen area groups that monitors USC's
growth.
</P>
<P>
   The shabby apartment buildings that line the streets around USC,
with bars on the windows and paint peeling from the walls, seem to
belong to a different world than the well-manicured campus.
Residents said USC is generally a good neighbor. But the contrast
makes some uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   Catalina Mendoza, 27, said she has lived in different apartments
near campus for six years with her sister Francisca and her two
young children.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think if it's for the students it's a good thing,'' Mendoza
said of the Radisson purchase. ''But if it's to get the university
more money, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Another local resident, Lucille Lee, was waiting for the bus on
a recent afternoon seated on a stoop across from campus.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel it's good to expand. It's good for the community,
education-wise,'' said Lee, 60. But, ''I still feel that they
should communicate more with the community and let the community
know what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   USC officials said the university's investment in the
neighborhood benefits everyone involved. An urban university's
growth inevitably courts criticism from neighbors, they said,
whether they're the well-heeled Greenwich Village denizens around
New York University or the poorer residents of Harlem near
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may be in our own self-interest to do so, but we do have
this urban, city commitment,'' Cherrie said. ''I don't know that
we'll ever be able to satisfy everyone who thinks we're
encroaching.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Garret Anderson and Mo Vaughn drove in
three runs apiece as the Anaheim Angels beat the New York Yankees
8-3 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Schoeneweis (6-6) won for only the second time in 13
starts, allowing three runs -- two earned -- and nine hits in 6 2-3
innings with a career-high nine strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fyhrie relieved Schoeneweis with two on and loaded the
bases with a walk to Jose Canseco before retiring Glenallen Hill on
a flyout to preserve the Angels' 6-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Hernandez (8-9) had his second unimpressive outing since
coming off the disabled list last Sunday, losing for the ninth time
in 13 decisions. Hernandez allowed seven runs and nine hits in 6
1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 4-0 after one inning, the Yankees closed to 4-3 on Paul
O'Neill's RBI single in the third and Bernie Williams' two-run
homer in the fifth, his 27th.
</P>
<P>
   But the Angels responded in the bottom half with a two-run
double by Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad, who had three hits, led off the seventh with his
major league-leading 180th hit of the season. One out later, Randy
Choate came in and Erstad stole second and third. Vaughn's
sacrifice fly made it 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus hit his 32nd homer -- 31 as a third baseman -- in the
eighth, breaking Doug DeCinces' club record.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels grabbed the 4-0 lead on Vaughn's two-run double,
Anderson's RBI double, and Adam Kennedy's bloop RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   A generous strike zone by umpire Laz Diaz helped Schoeneweis
diffuse a Yankee rally in the fourth. After a leadoff walk to
Canseco, Hill followed with a drive to right-center that was
touched by a fan leaning over the 18-foot-high wall.
</P>
<P>
   Canseco, who had to stay at third, was stranded when Tino
Martinez and Scott Brosius were called out on questionable called
third strikes, and Luis Sojo followed with a soft liner to short.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Anderson has had an RBI in 52 games this season, the most
on the Angels. ... Schoeneweis' strikeout total matched the highest
by any Angels pitcher this season. Kent Bottenfield had nine on
April 30 against Tampa Bay at Edison Field. ... Vaughn, who was hit
by a pitch in the fifth, has been plunked an AL-leading 12 times.
... Erstad set a new career best with 24th stolen bases. ...
Anaheim's Tim Salmon went 0-for-4, ending his career-best 17-game
hitting streak.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Edgar Martinez had a pair of run-scoring singles,
increasing his major league-leading RBIs total to 109, and the
Seattle Mariners beat Chuck Finley and the Cleveland Indians 7-1
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rickey Henderson went 1-for-3 with three RBIs, walking with the
bases loaded in the second and hitting a two-run single in the
eighth off Steve Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Finley (9-9) lasted 3 1-3 innings, his shortest of 24 starts
this season, allowing five runs, six hits and a season-high six
walks. Finley, 4-0 in six starts against Seattle since June 27,
1997, dropped to 19-8 against the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Abbott (8-4) improved to 4-0 in his career against
Cleveland, giving up one run, four hits and three walks in 7 2-3
innings. Jose Paniagua relieved with two on and got Manny Ramirez
to hit into a fielder's choice, then finished the five-hitter for
his third save in six chances.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle, returning from a 6-2 road trip against the New York
Yankees and the Chicago White Sox, improved 69-47, moving 22 games
over .500 for the first time. Cleveland lost for the second time in
nine games.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's run-scoring hits came in the first and fourth
innings.
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied at 1, the Mariners opened the second with
consecutive singles by Mike Cameron, David Bell, Joe Oliver, taking
a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McLemore singled, loading the bases, and Henderson got the
Mariners' major league-leading 25th bases-loaded walked. 2,040
walks, Henderson moved within 16 of Babe Ruth, baseball's career
leader (2,056).
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud's double-play grounder scored Oliver for a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland had three hits in the first, including Manny Ramirez's
RBI single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Finley fell hard to the ground after delivering his first
pitch to Henderson to start the game. Finley's right ankle appeared
to twist. ... Stan Javier, starting at first base for the Mariners
for the first time in 11 games after not playing first since 1997,
sprained his left shoulder in the second inning when he took a wide
throw from 3B David Bell and tagged out Cordero. He jammed his arm
against Cordero's thigh and Olerud pinch hit for him in the bottom
half. ... Plate umpire Bruce Froemming took a hard foul tip off
Sandy Alomar's bat in the second inning. Froemming leaned over in
pain, but stayed in the game. ... Martinez is on a pace for 152
RBIs, which would be a team record. The Mariners' RBIs record is
147, accomplished by Ken Griffey Jr. in 1997 and 1998. ... Kenny
Lofton's run in first tied Larry Doby for seventh on the Indians'
career list at 808.

   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Dean Palmer and Rich Becker each drove in
three runs Friday night and the Detroit Tigers sent the Oakland
Athletics to their sixth consecutive loss, 11-4.
</P>
<P>
   After skipping the last two games to be with his wife for the
delivery of twin boys, Palmer went 1-for-4. He's hit in 14 of his
last 16 starts and the Tigers are 26-11 when he drives in a run.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Becker hit a two-run homer for the Tigers and Juan Gonzalez hit
his 17th homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Heredia (13-8), who had won four straight decisions, allowed
a season-high seven runs, eight hits and five walks in 4 2-3

in seven career appearance against the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit scored in the first inning for the ninth time in 16

<HEADLINE> Koreas Media Agree To End Barbs  </HEADLINE>
By SANG-HUN CHOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The news media of South and North
Korea have agreed to end their decades-old mudslinging at each
other as a thaw spreads across the divided Korean peninsula after a
half-century of animosity.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was adopted Friday in the North Korean capital of
Pyongyang, where 46 South Korean newspaper and broadcast presidents
met their North Korean counterparts in a rare weeklong visit to the
communist state, which had been virtually closed to outside media.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, news media were at the forefront of the ideological
confrontation by trading barbs at the communist government in the
North and the pro-Western government in the South.
</P>
<P>
   ''The media organizations of the North and the South will avoid
confrontation between compatriots and stop slanders and calumnies,
which hurt national reconciliation and unity, in keeping with the
prevailing situation,'' the agreement said.
</P>
<P>
   The visit by the South Korean news executives came after leaders
of the two Koreas agreed to promote reconciliation during their
summit in June. Relations have improved rapidly since.
</P>
<P>
   News organizations of both Koreas will strive to help implement
the summit agreement, said the news media agreement, carried late
Friday by the North's official foreign news outlet, KCNA.
</P>
<P>
   They will ''cooperate with each other in news service and other
press activities and deepened mutual understanding and trust
through contacts, visits and exchange,'' it said. North Korea
agreed to dispatch a delegation of news media executives to visit
Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean executives are expected to return home late
Saturday on board a chartered plane flying the first direct air
route between Seoul and Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   The air route was opened to carry 100 people from each Korea who
will cross their heavily armed border on Tuesday for four-day
temporary family reunions with relatives separated by the 1950-53
Korean War. The war ended without a peace treaty in 1953 and the
border has been sealed ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Reuniting separated families was a key part of the summit
agreements between North Korean leader Kim Jong Il and South Korean
President Kim Dae-jung.
</P>
<P>
   The 46 South Korean newspaper and broadcast presidents began
their trip to North Korea last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Southern media used to describe Kim Jong Il as an unpredictable
recluse sponsoring terrorism, while North Korea had called the
South's media the ''stooges of reactionaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they have recently toned down their hostile rhetoric,
uneasiness lingers. The head of the conservative Chosun Daily, a
vocal critic of the communist regime, refused to join the
delegation.

NTSB Releases EgyptAir Reports
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The terrifying last moments of EgyptAir Flight 990 show
the captain battling in vain to save his plane and the 217 people aboard -- a
struggle that probably will add to the debate over what caused the crash.
Co-pilot Gameel El-Batouty was at the controls when the Boeing 767 nosed into
its fatal dive into the Atlantic Ocean. Some investigators have speculated he
crashed the plane deliberately. Egyptian authorities have denied that
suggestion. The National Transportation Safety Board released 1,665 pages of
fact-finding reports into the crash, routine in such major investigations. The
reports set forth what has been learned so far, but do not provide analysis or
suggest a probable cause.

   LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- In a victory bitterly contested by supporters of
party founder Ross Perot, Pat Buchanan won the Reform Party presidential
nomination tonight who refused to recognize the outcome. Their rival convention

Gore Courts Women's Vote

   BRIDGEPORT, Pa. (AP) -- Amid stockroom shelves piled with handsewn dolls, Al
Gore and Joseph Lieberman pitched their tax-cut plan -- in dollars-and-cents,
us-versus-them terms -- to women voters whose sagging support in polls worries
the Democratic presidential ticket. On a Friday devoted to women and union
workers, Vice President Gore threaded his message with references to the
performance record he shares with President Clinton. But he also found himself
again juggling the hot potato of Clinton's personal conduct in the White House.
Women voters gave a decisive boost to Clinton's 1996 re-election but polls show
they aren't giving Gore much of a lift.

Montana U. Makes Fire Exceptions
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BOULDER, Mont. (AP) -- With too many fires and not enough firefighters, the
Montana university system told students Friday they can report for fall classes
three weeks late if they stay on the fire lines. The dangers became all too real
Friday to firefighters in Wyoming, where a wind-fuel wildfire engulfed a truck,
killing one firefighter and burning another on the Wind River Indian
Reservation.It was the sixth firefighter death involving U.S. wildfires this
year. Strong winds had pushed flames out of control, forcing firefighters to
back off a 25,000-acre fire and a 5,000-acre fire, both burning in the sparsely
populated area of central Wyoming.

Regulators Design New Tire Tests
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Highway safety regulators are trying to update 30-year-old
tests for automobile tires that would prevent surprises like the problems that
led to the Firestone tire failures. Experts say existing tests are insufficient
and regulators were blindsided by the Firestone tire failures, culminating in a
recall of 6.5 million tires this week. Neither the tire maker,
Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., nor Ford Motor Co., which used the tires on its
Explorer sport-utility vehicle, has been able to explain what caused the
failures.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Reporter John Stossel apologized Friday night on ABC's

of organic food. Stossel prefaced the apology by defending other aspects of the
reports and said the mistakes were inadvertent. The apology was ordered by ABC
News, which also reprimanded Stossel and suspended a producer. Critics wanted
Stossel fired. In the reports, aired in February and again July 7, Stossel said
organic food was no safer than regular food and warned it could even be
dangerous. Stossel reported that an examination of produce conducted for ABC
News found that there was no pesticide residue on either conventional samples or
organic ones.

<HEADLINE> Libya Denies Money For Hostages  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- A Libyan envoy on Saturday denied
reports his country offered $25 million in ransom for European and
Asian hostages being held by a Muslim rebel group in the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul Rajab Azzarouq, Libya's former ambassador to the
Philippines, was reacting to reports last week in Beirut that Libya
had made the offer.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no truth to that. Our offer, which we talked about,
is a socio-economic package for livelihood projects,'' said
Azzarouq, who has been involved in negotiations to free the
captives held by the Abu Sayyaf rebels on Jolo island.
</P>
<P>
   The chief government negotiator, Robert Aventajado, also denied
the reports. But he said Libya has been involved in livelihood
projects for Muslim communities in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   The leading Beirut daily An-Nahar said in a report Aug. 5 that
Seif al-Islam, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's son, sent an
emissary to Manila to try for a deal.
</P>
<P>
   It said the envoy, Mohamad Ismail, contacted the Lebanese
Embassy in Tokyo and expressed ''full readiness'' to pay a ransom
of $1 million to gain the release of Marie Moarbes, a
Lebanese-French woman, as a first priority. The report also said
Libya would then pay $24 million for the liberation of the other
hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Ismail, who is helping Azzarouq, also denied the report.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's rubbish,'' he said, adding that it would be illogical to
give more than what the kidnappers had asked for.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf has demanded $1 million for each of the nine
Western hostages still in their hands -- two Germans, two Finns,
Moarbes, two other French, and two South Africans. The rebels are
also holding three French television journalists, three Malaysians
and two Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
   The Beirut newspaper said that under the deal the hostages would
be encouraged to travel to Libya to thank the leadership for its
mediation, a media show that Tripoli would use to improve its
international standing.
</P>
<P>
   Azzarouq said he has not heard of any plan to fly hostages to
Libya.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Philippine Air Transportation Office said it had
received an inquiry from the Libyan embassy on flying a plane from
Libya, although no request for a permit has been made. Azzarouq
said he was not informed of the embassy's call.
</P>
<P>
   Since he became ruler in 1969, Gadhafi has been supportive of
Muslim, nationalist and leftist rebel groups around the world. He
has a long history of ties with Muslim rebels in the southern
Philippines, having provided development aid and tried to help
negotiate peace agreements between rebels and the Philippine
government.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf is a loose collection of several hundred armed
Muslim rebels blamed by authorities for numerous attacks against
Christians in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   The group seized 21 hostages on April 23 from Sipadan island, a
Malaysian diving resort, and brought them to Jolo by boat. A German
woman and six Malaysians have since been released.

<HEADLINE> Cheney's $20M Package Said OK'd  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The energy services company that Dick Cheney ran
the last five years has agreed to let him retire with a package
worth an estimated $20 million, The New York Times reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The board of the Dallas-based Halliburton Co. approved the
arrangements on July 20, five days before Republican presidential
nominee Gov. George W. Bush announced his selection of Cheney as
his running mate, according to sources who have reviewed the deal.
The Times reported the deal on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The board's vote allowed Cheney, 59, to avoid a potentially
costly aspect of his employment contract, which said he would
forfeit some of his compensation if he retired before age 62
without the board's permission. Cheney served as the company's
chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The board did ''whatever the contract calls for,'' said member
W.R. Howell.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was nothing done at the board level of an exceptional
nature for Dick Cheney,'' Howell said.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Marcus, a spokesman for Halliburton, told The Associated
Press late Friday he did not know the details of Cheney's
retirement package, but said Cheney was taking a normal early
retirement, effective Aug. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, who spent much of his life as a public official and
federal employee, was paid at least $12.5 million in his years at
Halliburton and received stock and options worth nearly $39 million
at its current stock price, the Times said.
</P>
<P>
   By permitting Cheney to treat his departure as early retirement,
the directors allowed him to keep $10 million worth of stock and
options he would have forfeited had he simply resigned, the
company's public filings show. It was not clear whether the $10
million was part of the retirement package or in addition to it,
the Times said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the newspaper's sources briefed on the company's plan
said the board was told the package totaled about $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney spokesman Dirk Vande Beek told the Times that details of
the package were being worked out, and said Cheney would remain an
employee of Halliburton until Aug. 16 with the title ''chairman in
transition.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney has said in interviews that he would sell off his
Halliburton stock if the Republican ticket prevails in the fall.

<P>
   WHITTIER, Calif. (AP) -- A 16-year-old girl and her boyfriend
pleaded innocent Friday to murder in the stabbing deaths of the
girl's father and three of her siblings.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe Monica Diaz and her boyfriend, Michael
Naranjo, 17, attacked the family July 21 after Monica's parents
refused to allow them to go away together for a weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Both teens were being held without bail. They face a maximum of
life in prison without parole if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Monica's mother, Sylvia Flores, who was wounded in the attack,
attended Friday's hearing in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Richard Flores, 42; their sons, Richard Jr., 17,

<HEADLINE> Sorenstam Leads du Maurier Classic  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   AYLMER, Quebec (AP) -- One thing is clear after two rounds of the
du Maurier Classic: The Royal Ottawa Golf Club is Lorie Kane's home
course.
</P>
<P>
   Though Sweden's Annika Sorenstam held a 1-stroke lead at 6-under
138 midway through the last major of the year in women's golf, she
and everyone else have to contend with Canada's favorite golfer and
the fans who are turning out to cheer on Kane.
</P>
<P>
   Those supporters streamed after Kane on Friday as she shot the
best round of the day, 5-under 67, and moved alone into second
place.
</P>
<P>
   Some fans held up a ''PEI'' banner in honor of Kane's native
Prince Edward Island. Some kids had on T-shirts reading
''I-am-Kane-adian.''
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere, people wearing red or white -- Canada's colors -- were
scrambling to gain a vantage point around the Royal Ottawa course
to watch Kane.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never experienced this before, ever,'' Kane said. ''This
is what we work for. This is what we are, we're in the
entertainment business and we try to bring people out to introduce
them to the game of golf and the LPGA. And it's fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Kane won last week in St. Louis for the first time in her
five-year LPGA career after a string of nine second-place finishes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been waiting my whole life to win a golf tournament ...
the weight of the world is gone,'' she said Friday. ''And I'm out
here just having a blast. And I am as relaxed as I appear. I'm glad
I look relaxed, because I am.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kane is carrying another burden at the du Maurier. With the
tobacco company's sponsorship of Canada's only LPGA event being
terminated after this year due to government restrictions on
cigarette advertising, Kane said she wants to put on a good show to
entice another sponsor to keep the tournament alive.
</P>
<P>
   ''I truly believe that someone will see what's going on with
this tournament and how important it is to Canadian sport, not just
golf, but sport and women's sport for sure, that we're going to
find somebody to pick this up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam, who will be paired with Kane on Saturday, played one
group ahead of Kane both Thursday and Friday and said she could
tell from the roar of the crowd when Kane hit a shot and when her
playing partners -- Laura Davies and Pat Hurst -- did.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's her crowd. But the crowds here, they've very golf
knowledgeable,'' said Sorenstam, who is seeking her tour-leading
sixth victory of the year and a third career major. ''They don't
clap on your backswing, and I think that's the key here. They might
cheer louder for her, which is natural, but they're very
supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam talked on Wednesday and Thursday about the need to
control her nerves. As the leader on Friday, Sorenstam said she now
has to turn the pressure of being ahead to her advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nerves is part of the game,'' she said. ''That's the thrill
about it. I love the challenge, and you come down the stretch and
have a lot of adrenaline and feeling the pressure. That's what I
strive for. I don't like the pressure; but on the other hand, I
love the pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Diana D'Alessio said she has had enough of that pressure for
now. The tour rookie from New Jersey led Sorenstam and four others
by two strokes after Thursday's first round, but she struggled
Friday to a 1-over 73 and was tied with Juli Inkster and Laura
Philo for third at 4-under 140.
</P>
<P>
   With her first lead ever in an LPGA tournament -- not to mention
a major tournament -- D'Alessio said she slept badly Thursday night,
couldn't eat Thursday night or Friday before her round and in
general struggled mightily with her nerves.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just a tough day,'' D'Alessio said. ''I'm really,
really tired and really emotionally drained. But I have two more
days to go. So I'm going to find some more adrenalin.''
</P>
<P>
   Inkster had a 4-under 68 Friday, taking her accustomed spot on
the leader board at a major championship.
</P>
<P>
   Karrie Webb, chasing a $1 million bonus from Nabisco if she can
win her third major tournament of the year at the du Maurier, shot
an even-par 72 Friday and was at 1-under 143, five strokes off the
pace.

<HEADLINE> Greene Wins 100 at Weltklasse  </HEADLINE>
By ERICA BULMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- Maurice Greene is back. And Marion
Jones never went away.
</P>
<P>
   Marking a jubilant return from injury, Greene reasserted his
control in the 100 meters at the Weltklasse Golden League track
meet Friday with the third-fastest time this year.
</P>
<P>
   Jones recovered from a slow start to win the women's 100 --
continuing an unbeaten streak in the sprint dating back nearly
three years. She also fought off tough competition to capture the
women's long jump, boosting her hopes of achieving her dream of
five gold medals in next month's Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Declaring himself only ''about 85 percent'' fit after a strained
hamstring that forced him out of the 200 at the U.S. trials last
month, Greene crossed in 9.94 seconds ahead of a star-studded field
with eight of the top-10 sprinters this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm back,'' he announced after the race, his eyes shining and
a huge grin lighting up his face.
</P>
<P>
   ''As you see, I am OK and healthy,'' said Greene, who ran his
30th race under 10 seconds . ''I felt a little sluggish after being
off with injury, but it's getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   Obadele Thompson of Barbados was second in 9.97, while
Trinidad's Ato Boldon was third in 10.00 flat.
</P>
<P>
   Despite posting the season's fastest 100 time of 9.91 in Japan
back in May and the second fastest in 9.93 at the U.S. trials in
Sacramento, Greene has had an up-and-down 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   His injury in the 200 against Michael Johnson in the U.S. trials
eliminated him from that race in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   But he played down the disappointment of having to drop the 200
from his Olympic ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have two gold medals to go and get,'' he said, referring to
the 100 and relay. ''And after that there will be more World
Championship medals, and more Olympic medals,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   While Greene professed to be unhappy with his relatively slow
finish, Jones complained about her bad start in the sprint after
being pulled up for a false start.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a horrible day, technically,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones -- who posted the fastest 100 time of the season in 10.78
in London last weekend, crossed first in 10.95 -- edging runner-up
Inger Miller by .01.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about when she last lost a sprint race, Jones said, ''In
Japan in 1997,'' referring to a loss to Merlene Ottey in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Ottey raced in her first big international event since being
cleared of doping charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''Merlene brings a certain something to the race,'' Jones said.
''I was excited to see her back because it's like running against a
legend, something I can tell my grandkids about someday.''
</P>
<P>
   The 40-year-old Jamaican, who has a record seven Olympic medals,
basked in the crowd applause after finishing third in 11.06.
</P>
<P>
   ''I put a lot of pressure on myself,'' said Ottey, who tested
positive for nandrolone in Lausanne last year and subsequently
pulled out of the world championships in Seville. ''The time is
good and I feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones prevailed in the long jump with her first victory of the
season, leaping 22 feet, 9 inches, just ahead of Bulgaria's Iva
Prandzheva.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very satisfied because the field is probably the same one
that will be in Sydney,'' Jones said. ''It wasn't a very long jump,
but it was enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Morocco's Hicham Guerrouj, who had hoped to set a new world
record in the 1,500, crossed in 3 minutes, 27.21, comfortably
beating 21-year-old Noah Ngeny of Kenya, who had the previous best
time this year of 3:29.99. It was the third-fastest time ever.
</P>
<P>
   ''I showed my rivals and my admirers that I'm the best,'' El
Guerrouj said. ''It's an Olympic year and it's very special for me.
I hope to continue like this for the games.''
</P>
<P>
   Former world champion Maria Mutola of Mozambique won the women's
800 meters for the eighth consecutive year, crossing in 1:56.90,
the third-best time of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriela Szabo of Romania also declared her Olympic intentions,
posting the fastest time of the season in the 3,000.

<HEADLINE> Jaguars 16, Giants 13  </HEADLINE>
By EDDIE PELLS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Joe Pisarcik got some company.
</P>
<P>
   New York Giants rookies Jack Golden and Fred Lewis combined for
an unlikely bobble Friday night, transforming Lewis' interception
into a crazy, game-winning touchdown for the Jacksonville Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   It was just an exhibition game, but it was on national TV, and
the play that ended Jacksonville's 16-13 victory is one that could
be long remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to force a pass into the end zone during a late,
desperation drive, Jaguars quarterback Jonathan Quinn threw an
interception to Lewis, who was standing just outside the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' momentum brought him into the end zone, but as he crossed
the goal line again, teammate Jack Golden tried to tackle him,
hoping Lewis would go down and essentially end the game. But
Golden's hit popped the ball loose, it squirted to the back of the
end zone, and fourth-string Jags tight end Brandon Christenson
recovered for the game-winning touchdown with 7 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody in either locker room could remember anything like it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the most amazing play I've ever been involved in,''
said Christenson, who thus far had done little to distinguish
himself at training camp. ''It just shows that you should keep
playing, keep playing and see what happens. I'll take whatever I
can get. I need all the help I can get.''
</P>
<P>
   In the only other preseason games Friday night, Washington beat
New England 30-20, and Atlanta defeated Cincinnati 31-16.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn finished 8-for-23 for 94 yards and struggled except for
the late drive in which he converted two fourth-and-longs before
his ''game-winning'' interception.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a weird feeling,'' he said. ''But any way you look at
it, it's a win.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Pisarcik -- who bobbled a handoff to Larry Csonka in
1978 when the Giants should have simply taken a knee against
Philadelphia -- had company.
</P>
<P>
   ''All week, coach stressed being smart and making smart plays,''
Golden said. ''I saw Freddie catch the ball, and my first instinct
was to get him down. I made a mistake. I plan on bouncing back from
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just a stupid play by me,'' Lewis said. ''Just a bad
play by two rookies.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars were flabbergasted, but not happy, with their
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''The good thing about this game is we kept on playing,'' coach
Tom Coughlin said. ''It certainly isn't the way you would draw it
up, but I give credit to Brandon for being the right man at the
right spot at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Their first-team defense looked like it could use rush lineman
Tony Brackens, who reported to camp earlier in the day, but watched
the game from the press box. The Giants gained 203 yards in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   On offense, Jacksonville's injury-ravaged line struggled against
the Giants, who were bigger and more powerful than the reserves the
Jaguars faced against Carolina in a 34-14 win last week.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Taylor left on the second play of the game with a sprained
ligament in his left knee. Coughlin said he could miss 3-4 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguars quarterback Mark Brunell threw most of his nine passes
off three-step drops and rollouts, trying to avoid injuries behind
a line with no proven veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Brunell went 6-for-9 for 67 yards and led the Jaguars on one
nice drive in a little more than a quarter. It resulted in Mike
Hollis' 39-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight week, the Giants outplayed their
opponent in defeat. Last week, they lost 20-8 to Chicago despite
gaining 401 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Playing more like an every-down back than a third-down
specialist, Tiki Barber accounted for 110 yards -- all in the first
half -- to help the Giants to a 10-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Dayne put in his second straight up-and-down performance.
The Heisman-winning first-round draft pick rushed for 66 yards on
17 carries, with most of his success coming against second-teamers.
He's averaging 3.4 yards on 34 carries this preseason.
</P>
<P>
Redskins 30, Patriots 20
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Davis made a solid return in his first game since knee
surgery, and Skip Hicks ran for 98 yards and a touchdown as
Washington (1-1) beat visiting New England (2-1).
</P>
<P>
   Davis nursed an ankle injury during the offseason after leading
the NFC in rushing, then reported to camp late because of a
holdout. He rushed for 24 yards on six carries.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Smith had an impressive debut for Washington, sacking Drew
Bledsoe on the defensive end's first play and making the tackle on
an up-the-middle run on his second.
</P>
<P>
Falcons 31, Bengals 16
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta star Jamal Anderson played for the first time in almost
a year, catching three passes for 15 yards in the Falcons' victory
over Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   The running back gained no yards on five carries in his first
game since injuring his right knee Sept. 20 against Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Chandler gave the Falcons (3-0) a 10-6 first-half lead
when he completed 12 of 18 passes for 177 yards, including a
38-yard scoring pass to Brian Finneran.
</P>
<P>
   Corey Dillon, who ended his holdout this week and joined the
Bengals (0-2) for the flight to Atlanta, saw no action.

<HEADLINE> Beford Claims Olympic Spot  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- B.J. Bedford is certainly persistent. She's
also an Olympian -- finally. Bedford made the U.S. swim team on her
fourth trip to the trials, with a little last-minute help from a
stranger on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Bedford ended her 12-year wait with a victory in the 100-meter
backstroke Friday on the third night of the trials. She won in 1
minute, 1.85 seconds, ahead of Courtney Shealy of Columbia, S.C.,
who hung on for the second Olympic berth in 1:02.05.
</P>
<P>
   Over the final 10 meters, Bedford had one thought on her mind.
''Good God, where is the wall?'' she said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Lenny Krayzelburg was thinking the same thing in the men's 100
back. Considered most likely to lower his own world record at the
trials, he went out too fast and faded at the end to win in 53.84
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I dove for the wall and made my dolphin kick, the wall
wasn't there yet, so I had to take one more kick,'' he said. ''It's
a learning experience for Sydney. For the next five weeks, I have
to work on swimming my own race. At this meet, you get caught up in
the emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   Bedford certainly did.
</P>
<P>
   Unnerved as the day wore on, Bedford tried to call a sports
psychologist she regularly consults at the U.S. Olympic Training
Center in Colorado Springs, Colo. But the woman wasn't there.
</P>
<P>
   ''So I talked to some other guy,'' she said. ''He made me feel a
little better. I need to call him back and thank him.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Bedford just missed the team by finishing third
in the 100 back at the trials. She was bartending in Texas during
the Atlanta Games, pouring drinks while customers watched swimming.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was like, 'Get that crap off the TV,''' she said earlier in
the week, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Lea Mauer, the American record-holder in the 100 back, finished
third, missing a spot on the team by two-tenths of a second. The
high school English teacher in Lake Forest, Ill., hung over the
lane marker, covering her face in anguish.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's more sad people than happy people at this meet,'' she
said. ''I swam a good race plan, and it just wasn't good enough.
For some reason, it was harder than it should've been.''
</P>
<P>
   With a sellout crowd of 4,500 at the Indiana University
Natatorium cheering him on, Krayzelburg and Neil Walker competed in
what was essentially a two-man race.
</P>
<P>
   Walker earned a spot on the Olympic team at 54.85 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Davis broke a 12-year-old American record in the 200 free,
winning in 1:47.26. That eclipsed Matt Biondi's mark of 1:47.72 in
the 1988 Seoul Olympics, but was still nearly two seconds off the
world record, held by Australian Ian Thorpe.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, 27, of Austin, Texas, won three gold medals in the 1996
Atlanta Games -- the most of any male athlete.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Goldblatt of Austin finished second in 1:48.12 to make his
first Olympic team at 1:48.12. Chad Carvin and Klete Keller, who
already qualified for the team, finished 3-4 to earn spots on the
800 relay in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen-year-old Megan Quann of Puyallup, Wash., also is heading
to the Olympics for the first time after winning the 100
breaststroke in 1:07.26 -- just 0.14 off her American record set a
day earlier. Staciana Stitts of Carlsbad, Calif., took the other
spot at 1:07.79.

<HEADLINE> China Aims To Rescue Gorge Relics  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China is accelerating efforts to rescue cultural
relics from the giant Three Gorges Dam area, with plans to spend
$12 million over the next year, an official newspaper said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The money is equal to the total amount of special funds China
earmarks each year to protect all its major cultural relics, the
People's Daily said in its overseas edition.
</P>
<P>
   Archeologists are racing to save relics before the dam, the
world's largest hydroelectric project, begins filling up in three
years.
</P>
<P>
   The area, along the Yangtze River in southern China, is rich in
sites of historical and cultural interest, many of which will be
submerged when the 600-foot-high dam is completed in 2009, creating
a 350-mile-long reservoir and displacing at least 1.3 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   The government says the dam will control chronic flooding, which
as recently as 1998 killed 4,150 people, and produce electricity to
feed a growing economy.
</P>
<P>
   Critics contend the dam's impact on the area's cultural legacy
will be devastating and say relics that could shed light on Chinese
history along the Yangtze's middle and upper reaches will be lost.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, following a three-year investigation, Chinese
archeologists formulated a plan to protect 1,087 cultural sites in
the Three Gorges at an estimated cost of $120 million, the People's
Daily said.

<HEADLINE> Many Driving Stolen Cars in Mexico  </HEADLINE>
By OSWALD ALONSO
<TEXT>
<P>
   CUERNAVACA, Mexico (AP) -- It could go down as one of the
greatest used car deals in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers grew suspicious and called for an inquiry into the
loaning of 75 stolen cars after a Roman Catholic bishop was seen
driving one of them in March. They demanded authorities explain.
</P>
<P>
   A state attorney general's office report released Friday says
that police commanders, journalists, the bishop and a social
activist have been driving stolen cars recovered by authorities in
the central Mexican state of Morelos.
</P>
<P>
   The 75 stolen vehicles loaned by police included Jeep Cherokees
and Volkswagen Jettas, police said.
</P>
<P>
   A clearly irritated Bishop Luis Reynoso Cervantes of the
Cuernavaca Diocese said the matter was being blown out of
proportion. He said police wanted to place the cars on exhibit so
the community could see what they had recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to tell you that a lot of times they exhibit the cars
so that the victims can identify them,'' said Reynoso Cervantes,
adding that the truck was given to a priest and was being used only
until the church got the funds to buy its own. The truck has since
been returned to the state attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   The news caused an uproar Friday among opposition state
lawmakers who demanded 25 cars still on the road be returned to the
state's attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   ''This should be punished for the illegal use of these stolen
cars,'' said Rep. Juan Ignacio Suarez Huape of the center-left
Democratic Revolution Party. ''There is no legal authority that
allows authorities to hand over seized goods for what they call
'use and exhibition.'''
</P>
<P>
   The lawmaker also said former state Attorney General Jose
Leonardo Castillo Pombo should be held responsible. Castillo Pombo,
who resigned last year amid accusations of having links to drug
traffickers, authorized the cars to be loaned, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report obtained by The Associated Press lists four former
top police officials among those found driving the cars, including
two commanders who were dismissed on accusations of extortion and
alleged ties to kidnapping rings. One commander was later rehired.
</P>
<P>
   The report also names a leader of a state peasant organization
and eight journalists, including radio, TV and newspaper reporters.
</P>
<P>
   State Prosecutor Rogelio Sanchez Gatica condemned the practice
and ordered the cars to be returned.

<HEADLINE> Sanchez To Move DNC Fund-Raiser  </HEADLINE>
By ERICA WERNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN GROVE, Calif. (AP) -- In an 11th-hour decision aimed at
healing an embarrassing party rift, Rep. Loretta Sanchez pulled a
fund-raiser from the Playboy Mansion but offered no apologies to
her fellow Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our decision is that we will be moving the Hispanic Unity USA
Party,'' Sanchez told reporters after taking a deep breath Friday.
''We will be moving it to a different location. We will be having
in on Tuesday night.''
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders responded by immediately restoring the speaking
slot at next week's Democratic National Convention that they had
taken from Sanchez on Thursday when she refused to move the
fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   While she said Friday she regretted the ''discord and
disagreement'' within the party, she gave no ground on her decision
to schedule the event at the Playboy Mansion, famed for its
scantily clad women. And she praised Playboy's Hugh Hefner and his
daughter, Christie, for their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ''This in no way reflects anything other than appreciation to
the Hefners and to Playboy Enterprises,'' Sanchez told reporters
outside her Garden Grove district office.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders feared that the event, though not sanctioned
by the party, could undermine attempts to portray Gore and running
mate Joseph Lieberman as pro-family, and could give Republicans an
easy target in the fall campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raiser for Hispanic Unity's voter registration
initiative will now be held at B.B. King's Blues Club in Universal
City.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he supported the party's decision to distance itself
from the event -- and from Sanchez, a staunch supporter -- despite
his own acceptance of campaign money from Playboy, including a
$1,000 donation Hefner made last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's apples and oranges,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Party chairman Joe Andrew lauded Sanchez's decision to abandon
the mansion as a ''courageous act,'' but not all Democrats agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The president pro tem of the California Senate faxed a letter to
Andrew saying he would protest by giving $25,000 he was raising for
the Democratic National Committee to Hispanic Unity instead.
</P>
<P>
   ''This isn't the Democratic Party I grew up with. ... It smacks
more of fascism than the Democratic Party,'' said Sen. John Burton,
D-San Francisco. ''What are they going to do next, burn books?''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew said freedom of speech was not the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not moralizing against Playboy. We're not moralizing
against the Playboy Mansion. We're just saying it's an
inappropriate place for a person with a title within the party to
hold an event,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez attained near-folk hero status in the Latino community
and was embraced and elevated by the Democratic party after her
surprise win over longtime Rep. Robert K. Dornan, a conservative
Republican, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   DNC officials loudly proclaimed that the weight of Hispanic
opinion was on their side in sanctioning her. They cited support
from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and offered to provide
interviews with Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina, who
condemned Sanchez's position.
</P>
<P>
   At her press conference Friday, Sanchez alluded to the
Democrats' claims.
</P>
<P>
   ''In tough times there are people who stick by you and people
who don't,'' she said, reeling off a list of Hispanic leaders she
said supported her, including Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, former U.S.
Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Henry Cisneros, and
state Sen. Hilda Solis.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez's Republican opponent in November's election, Gloria
Matta Tuchman, wasted no time in jumping on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''She has embarrassed her party and embarrassed the people of
the 46th congressional district,'' said Tuchman, a schoolteacher
and 1998 candidate for state superintendent of public instruction.

<HEADLINE> Author Smiley Learned From Horses  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- Pulitzer-winning author Jane
Smiley says her new interest in horses has taught her many things,
including simply to pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't realize until I had a horse how much time I spent
preoccupied. I had to ask for help and take lessons,'' said Smiley,
who spoke Monday at the National Racing Hall of Fame induction
ceremony here.
</P>
<P>
   She won a 1992 Pulitzer Prize for her novel ''A Thousand Acres''
about a farming family; her latest book is set at a racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   Smiley said the Pulitzer did not change her life, but that
horses did.
</P>
<P>
   ''He taught me to pay attention,'' she told the audience about
her first horse, which has been joined by 18 more. ''He gave me the
feeling of grace, power, the feeling of forward movement and
rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He also taught me to relax,'' Smiley said. ''I found out
quickly that a horse won't relax when you ride him unless you
relax, too. ... I knew that everyday I would learn something about
the horses and about myself.''

<HEADLINE> Saudi Prisoner Riot Injures 18  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- A Saudi Arabian prison riot
over living conditions and insufficient recreational facilities
left a guard and 17 inmates injured, a security official said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all 400 prisoners in the Central Prison in the northern
Saudi city of Al-Jawf began rioting Thursday after dozens of
inmates beat up a guard and set fire to blankets and mattresses,
the official said by telephone from the Saudi capital, Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
   Riot police and special security forces dispatched on two C-130
military planes helped prison guards quash the protest Friday, the
official said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi authorities do not tolerate any sort of dissent, and the
official said the riot was the first of its kind in the kingdom.
Damage inside the prison was extensive.
</P>
<P>
   The mostly Saudi prisoners sought a meeting with the governor of
Al-Jawf, Prince Abdul Elah, after the warden repeatedly failed to
come through with promised prison improvements, the official said.
An envoy met with them after the riot and promised to take their
demands -- which include better food, cleaner living conditions,
newspapers, recreational facilities and doors on bathrooms -- to the
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Jawf is 435 miles north of Riyadh.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans Homes For Teen Parents  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The birth rate among teen-agers has dropped,
but girls and young women still have nearly a half-million babies
each year, President Clinton said Saturday in promoting
second-chance homes that provide job counseling and parenting
skills.
</P>
<P>
   ''These homes provide teen-age moms and their babies with an
environment that is safe, supportive and supervised,'' Clinton said
in his radio address, which he taped on Air Force One while flying
to Los Angeles to attend the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''The teens get the help they need to finish school. They learn
how to care for their children and manage a budget. Some homes also
work with teen fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged Congress to provide $25 million to start more
second-chance homes.
</P>
<P>
   He also directed the secretaries of the Health and Human
Services and Housing and Urban Development departments to make it
easier for community- and religion-based groups to acquire vacant
or foreclosed property to create more second-chance homes for teen
parents. The government, he said, would give communities a road map
of federal and state resources they can use to set up more of these
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I read of one young Massachusetts woman who got pregnant at
14, and soon was estranged from her family with no place to live,''
Clinton said. ''With the help of a second-chance home, she got back
on her feet, trained at a community college and has left welfare to
become a proud, working mother.''
</P>
<P>
   The president cited a report this week by the federal Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention that teen-agers are having
babies at the lowest rate in at least 60 years. For every 1,000
girls aged 15 to 19, there were about 50 births last year, the
lowest level since the statistic was first recorded six decades
ago.
</P>
<P>
   If the teen birth rate had remained at its peak in 1991, teen
mothers would have given birth to 120,000 more babies this year,
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the drop-off in teen births, analysts said the HIV
virus and AIDS became mainstream enough in the 1990s to scare
teen-agers, while awareness of other sexually transmitted diseases
was at an all-time high. They said ad campaigns, community
awareness groups and even seeing friends have children encouraged
teens to be more careful -- or stop having sex entirely.

<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) - The jackpot in the multistate Big Game lottery
drawing has grown to $17 million.
</P>
<P>
   None of the tickets sold for Friday's $13 million drawing
matched all five lotto numbers and the Big Money Ball. The next

</P>
<P>
   Four second-prize winners won $150,000 in Friday night's

worth $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   The winning numbers from Friday's drawing were: 2-14-19-24-28
(two, fourteen, nineteen, twenty-four, twenty-eight). The Big Money

<HEADLINE> Mother, Children Killed in Algeria  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -- A pregnant woman and three of her
children were shot and killed at a roadblock set up by an armed
group, Algerian media reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, her husband and their four children were returning
home to Algiers from a beach outing Friday when a group of armed
men opened fire on their car, the daily newspaper Liberte reported.
The attack occurred near El-Aouana, about 225 miles east of
Algiers, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The father, a 46-year-old professor at the University of
Algiers, was shot in the stomach and head. He remained in critical
condition at a hospital in Jijel, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   One child, a seven-year-old girl, managed to escape the gunmen.
Her mother and three siblings, ages 18 months to 14 years, were
shot to death, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   This North African country is plagued by violence despite a
peace drive by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Some 100,000 people
have died since 1992, when military-backed authorities canceled an
election that a now-banned Islamic party was expected to win,
triggering an Islamic insurgency.

<HEADLINE> Budget Surplus Sought For Americans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The budget surplus should be returned to
American taxpayers, Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Santorum, speaking in the weekly GOP radio address, said two
pieces of legislation passed this year by the Republican-controlled
Congress would have given some tax relief to American families. One
bill aimed at the so-called marriage penalty has already been
vetoed by President Clinton, an a veto threat hangs over another
bill that would eliminate the estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has argued that the tax cuts would cause deficits, and
that just as many married couples benefit from a quirk in the tax
code as pay more. He has also characterized an estate tax cut as a
benefit for the rich.
</P>
<P>
   Santorum said some survivors are forced to sell off family farms
and small businesses to pay the estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   ''Families that work together to build a business should be able
to pass it on to their children,'' he said. ''Local, family owned
business enrich our towns, small communities and cities with new
jobs and new opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Santorum is running for chairman of the Republican Conference,
the No. 3 leadership spot in the Senate majority, assuming he wins
a second term in the November election. Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga.,
who died last month, had announced plans to run for chairman to
replace Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., who is not seeking re-election in
November.

<HEADLINE> Clinton ducks debate invitations from Democratic challenger  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Contrary to what many New Yorkers believe,
Hillary Rodham Clinton is not yet the official U.S. Senate nominee
of the Democratic Party. She faces a Sept. 12 primary against an
orthopedic surgeon from New York City.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Dr. Mark McMahon hasn't been able to get the time of day
from the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Pending federal court action, she could also face several other
Democrats in the primary. None, including McMahon, are household
names and none seem likely to threaten her chances of going up
against Republican U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio in November.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, McMahon managed to collect the signatures of more
than 40,000 Democrats statewide to win a spot on the primary
ballot. He needed at least 15,000 signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, McMahon has been unsuccessfully trying to get the
first lady to meet him in a series of debates on such things as
health care, education, the economy and foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that out of respect for the 4.9 million Democrats in
the state she should debate the home-grown candidate on the issues
New Yorkers care most about,'' the physician said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon has been making much of the fact that Clinton lacks New
York roots. She only moved to the state in January.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon is not alone in his inability to get an answer from
Clinton on whether she will debate him. Consider this exchange
between reporters and the first lady in Albany on Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you going to debate your Democratic primary opponent?
</P>
<P>
   A: You know, I'm focused on the campaign that New Yorkers expect
to see between me and my (Republican) opponent. There is still
another federal court challenge on the other matter, so my focus is
really on talking about what I'll do in the Senate and pointing out
the differences between me and Congressman Lazio on issues that are
important to New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why wouldn't you debate a Democratic opponent? You have one.
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, you still have a federal court challenge that is going
on about who's going to be on that ballot. We're going to wait and
see how that plays out.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Then you will debate if there's one, or not?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm going to stay focused on the election that is really
mattering to New Yorkers and the one that we're all engaged in and
that is the difference between Republicans and Democrats and
between me and my opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you will not debate?
</P>
<P>
   A: We're going to focus on this election. We're going to focus
on the issues that are important to New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you don't want to give us a yes or no on whether you'll
debate him?
</P>
<P>
   A: We'll wait and see how all these court challenges play
themselves out.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, with her poll numbers largely stagnant at under 50
percent support for months, Clinton recently challenged Lazio to a
series of debates.
</P>
<P>
   Given that, the Lazio campaign jumped on the McMahon bandwagon,
charging in one news release that ''Hillary Hypocrisy Hits
Hindenburg Heights.'' Lazio campaign manager Bill Dal Col fumed:
''Hillary Clinton needs to realize that New Yorkers don't coronate
their senators.''
</P>
<P>
   But the first lady's campaign, apparently concerned about being
embarrassed in the primary by McMahon, has chosen to ignore him.
The extent of his campaign has been one recent swing across the
state and as many media interviews as he can get.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican who switched to the Democratic Party in 1997,
McMahon said he doesn't understand ''why she would somehow be
afraid to debate me. All I am is a citizen of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Clinton's Democratic allies tried to make it even
tougher for McMahon.
</P>
<P>
   Four other Democrats also filed petitions with the state Board
of Elections seeking to get into the primary. All lacked the 15,000
signatures needed. The two Republican members of the four-member
board voted to invalidate the four petitions, a move that would
have put Clinton and McMahon in a head-to-head primary. But the two
Democratic members of the board abstained, denying the third vote
needed to invalidate the petitions. That left a six-way primary, a
dilution of any anti-Clinton vote and less chance for McMahon to
embarrass her.
</P>
<P>
   A state judge subsequently invalidated the four petitions, but
the federal courts are also considering the situation and could
restore any or all of the four to the primary ballot.

<HEADLINE> Immigrant Ship Taken to Italy Port  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CROTONE, Italy (AP) -- Pulled into port by Italian ships, a
battered, reeking boat carrying 240 illegal immigrants landed in
southern Italy on Saturday after what exhausted passengers said
were days adrift with a broken rudder.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers, 113 of them children, arrived weak and filthy.
''They were in terrible condition -- hygiene aboard the ship was not
good,'' Police Commissioner Giuseppe Caruso said.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers said they were Kurds, but none of the first ones
questioned would tell police what port they had left from, Caruso
said. Italian media said their nationalities included Turkish,
Syrian and Iraqi.
</P>
<P>
   The illegal immigrants said they had been at sea for six days.
It was not clear how much of that time was with the rudder broken.
</P>
<P>
   Italian authorities spotted the rusted 200-foot ship overnight
near the port of Crotone in Italy's southern Calabria region.
Escorting the broken-down ship to port took hours, with Italian
police and port authority ships having to pull it the last part of
the way.
</P>
<P>
   It was at least the 15th ship laden with illegal immigrants to
arrive in Calabria this year, including one that ran aground near
the port Sunday with 418 illegal immigrants. Italy has stepped up
pressure on Turkey, Albania and its other neighbors to the east and
south to do more to stop the influx.
</P>
<P>
   Kurds arriving in Italy often ask for political asylum. Italy
generally releases them pending a decision, freeing them to head
north to Germany and other more prosperous countries in search of
jobs.

<HEADLINE> Japan Festival of Dead Draws Crowd  </HEADLINE>
By GARY SCHAEFER
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Every August, Japan's cemeteries and graveyards
come alive during the Festival of the Dead, a time when ancestors
who have passed into the other world are believed to return for a
brief visit.
</P>
<P>
   But with the living crowded into just about every last nook and
cranny in Tokyo, the ancient Buddhist festival is forcing many to
face an uncomfortable fact of modern life -- that for those in need
of a final resting place, the situation is, well, quite grave.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next week, tens of millions of Japanese will visit
their family plots for the ''Obon'' festival, one of the most
important celebrations on the Japanese calendar. The festival has
become synonymous with summer vacation, and many of the country's
businesses will close down until it is over.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its name, Obon is generally a time to be enjoyed. Late
night outdoor dances and fairs are held, and young men and women
dress up in traditional Japanese-style kimono to partake in
time-honored rituals: They catch goldfish and play a game in which
blindfolded participants try to break a watermelon with a stick.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no doubt that Obon's centerpiece -- its graveyards --
are in the throes of a serious crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The main problem is space, particularly in the greater Tokyo
area, where about one-fifth of Japanese live.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unless you plan on waiting or have a lot of money to spend,
your only choice is to look for a cemetery outside Tokyo,'' said
Masaru Fujikura, a 70-year-old retiree.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent book called ''Graves: What Will You Do?,''
the cremated remains of as many as one million Tokyoites are being
kept at home by families who are for various reasons unable to make
suitable arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Many are simply waiting for a plot.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo has eight city-operated graveyards, but only four of them
have any openings. This year, there were five applicants for each
available plot, and the winners were chosen by lottery.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really hard to see how we can build any more large-scale,
centrally located cemeteries in the future,'' said Hideo Honma,
head of the city's cemetery department.
</P>
<P>
   Temples, which have traditionally handled most of the burden,
are running out of room as well.
</P>
<P>
   A good example is Daiyoji, one of the more than 70 Buddhist
temples in Tokyo's eastern cemetery district, which has seen off
the city's departing sprits since the days of the shoguns.
</P>
<P>
   Daiyoji's grounds are filled with tight rows of weather-beaten
gravestones that are all variations on the customary tower-like
design. But the chances of getting a plot there today are virtually
nil.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even if people wanted to build new graves here, we just don't
have the space,'' said Yukiko Kitayama, the wife of the temple's
priest.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Japanese graves take up much space to begin with.
Since most Japanese are cremated, the average grave occupies only
about one square yard. But at Tokyo's publicly operated graveyards,
even a memorial plot that size averages between $13,000 and
$18,000, including materials and construction costs.
</P>
<P>
   The land pinch has inspired some clever innovations over the
past several years. There are now tiny grave-boxes that look like
coin-operated lockers, or computer-operated gizmos that bring
memorials up from space-saving underground storage whenever a
relative comes to visit.
</P>
<P>
   But such innovations challenge many deeply held beliefs about
just what a proper grave should be.
</P>
<P>
   Graves in Japan have traditionally been considered monuments to
a family, not to an individual. They are usually maintained by the
eldest son, and family members are expected to burn incense there
and place flowers on them regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, that is not happening. And when a family grave
falls into permanent neglect, its occupants may be transferred to a
common burial site. Before that can happen, the cemetery is
required by law to take a series of steps to locate relatives of
the deceased.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, private companies are offering solutions, usually in
the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Hills Kawasaki Seichi is a prototype: Laid out on a terraced
hillside surrounded by rice fields and pumpkin patches, it's a
non-denominational cemetery with a park-like ambiance.
</P>
<P>
   Getting there, however, takes more than an hour by train from
downtown Tokyo. And a permanent resting place can run $43,900.
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters of its 1,500 plots are still empty.

<HEADLINE> Crowds Swarm Zurich Street Parade  </HEADLINE>
By CLARE NULLIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- Switzerland's normally sober
financial capital was transformed into a multicolored party
Saturday as an estimated half a million revelers in weird and
wonderful outfits swarmed to a vast street parade.
</P>
<P>
   Pink and green boa feathers and synthetic furs, all-over silver
body paint and costumes fashioned out of CDs or drink cans were the
order of the day as exuberant exhibitionists turned out to see and
be seen at the techno music festival.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty so-called Lovemobiles -- extravagant truck-drawn floats
with names like Utopia Fetish de Luxe -- pounded out techno beats,
deafening even through the wax ear plugs handed out free of charge
by organizers and local hotels.
</P>
<P>
   The parade, which started as a minor event in 1991, has grown
into the second biggest techno festival after Berlin's. It is worth
an estimated $40-$60 million to the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nuts, but it's fantastic,'' said Regina Nagle of Chicago,
summing up the mood of the pulsating crowds thronging Zurich's
elegant lake front.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing you can remotely compare it to is Mardi Gras
where you watch other people being outrageous,'' said Nagle, a
28-year-old technical consultant wearing glittering false eyelashes
under a vivid pink hat. ''Here you can be outrageous yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're having a brilliant time,'' whooped Nicole Zuend and her
friend Marion Joos, faces painted silver and clad in identical pink
fairy-like outfits. The two said that at the end of the weekend,
they would resume their ''normal'' lives as pediatric nurses.
</P>
<P>
   Zurich's main railway station declared itself the official
''warm-up rave area,'' offering make-up and body-painting services
to tens of thousands of people arriving on extra trains from
Germany and other parts of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   City authorities initially treated the fans as freaks and once
tried to ban the parade as too noisy and messy. But they now
enthusiastically embrace the event, which helps dispel the crusty
image of a city inhabited only by bankers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Zurich is pulsating to a new rhythm,'' the conservative Neue
Zuercher Zeitung trumpeted in an editorial singing the praises of
the parade. The paper even published its own guide to the rave
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a few drug-related incidents, the parade was
overwhelmingly good-natured. The predominantly young partygoers
infected even normally reserved elderly locals with their high
spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ''You couldn't do something like this in New York because people
would be worried about the security aspect,'' said Steve Ganski, a
middle-aged native of Cincinnati who works in Zurich. ''Here it's
totally safe and we love it,'' he laughed as he stepped out of the
firing line of one of the omnipresent water pistols.

<HEADLINE> Woman makes yarmulkes for Gore-Lieberman ticket  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - A Stamford woman has become the official
yarmulke maker of the Gore-Lieberman presidential ticket.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing that Stamford-native Lieberman had been chosen as
Al Gore's running mate, Marsha Greenberg decided to knit him a
gift.
</P>
<P>
   The end result was a blue yarmulke with red and white striped
letters reading, ''Gore-Lieberman 2000.'' A yarmulke is a skull cap
worn by Jewish males as a sign of humility before God.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the first Orthodox Jew who's gotten so far, I knew he would
wear it if I could get it to him,'' she said. ''It's the campaign
yarmulke.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg called Harold Bernstein, a cousin of Lieberman and
president of Congregation Agudath Sholom, which she attends.
Bernstein passed along the skull cap to one of Lieberman's aides at
the Italian Center of Stamford, where the senator and Vice
President Al Gore visited Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg was later told about a playful struggle between the
two candidates over her handiwork.
</P>
<P>
   ''Senator Lieberman thought it was wonderful, but Gore just
flipped and took it from Lieberman,'' Greenberg said. ''It was like
two boys fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, when it became apparent Gore really was intent on
keeping the yarmulke, a Lieberman aide called Bernstein to ask
Greenberg if she could make another for the senator.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein will take the yarmulke to the Democratic Convention in
Los Angeles next week to present it to Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg said it takes about eight hours of stitch-work to
complete the cap.
</P>
<P>
   ''I start with six stitches in the center and keep making loops
outward,'' she said. ''It's very tedious, but I sit in front of the
television or take it with me on the train.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg is a musician but said she has always made yarmulkes
as a sideline for friends and family. She said she was flattered
that Gore wanted her yarmulke.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gore broke ground by selecting Senator Lieberman,'' Greenberg
said. ''He's not shying away from Lieberman's religion. He's
embracing it. It's wonderful to see.''

<HEADLINE> Father seeks cure for his son's rare genetic disorder  </HEADLINE>
By MARY ESCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   HYDE PARK, N.Y. (AP) - Bill Skojec gazes into the sparkling eyes
of his wispy-haired son with the intensity of someone absorbed in a
novel.
</P>
<P>
   He savors every giggle, every wave, every babbled ''Da-da,''
knowing that too soon, he'll reach the final chapter of his little
boy's life. And despite his desperate efforts to rewrite the
ending, Skojec knows it's not likely to be a happy one.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Skojec has a genetic disorder called sialidosis. At 19
months old, he cannot walk or hold a cup. He sits unsupported only
briefly. But he laughs delightedly when his 4-year-old sister plays
with him.
</P>
<P>
   Sialidosis is so uncommon that fewer than 50 cases have been
recorded in medical literature. In an Internet search, Skojec and
his wife were able to find scant information about the disease.
They have managed to contact only one other family, in Canada,
whose child suffers from it.
</P>
<P>
   Sialidosis is one of the rarest of a group of 41 inherited
metabolic defects known as lysosomal storage disorders. These
diseases are characterized by the lack of certain enzymes needed to
break down fats and carbohydrates.
</P>
<P>
   The enzyme deficiency causes waste products to build up in body
tissues, causing problems with vision, hearing, movement, skeletal
development, and brain function.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms may include muscle spasms, tremors, lack of
coordination, impaired vision, bone deformities, coarse facial
features, mild mental retardation, enlarged liver or spleen,
breathing difficulty, developmental delays, and accumulation of
fluid in the abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   One form of sialidosis doesn't produce symptoms until
adolescence. In the more severe form that Alex has, symptoms
develop soon after birth, and death usually comes at a very early
age.
</P>
<P>
   When Alex was born, he had broken blood vessels on his back and
shoulders. Doctors suspected a rare blood clotting disorder, but
tests came back negative. When he was six months old, he had
enlarged kidneys, liver, and spleen, as well as developmental
delays, but medical tests failed to reveal a cause.
</P>
<P>
   He developed a high fever when he was 11 months old and was
admitted to the hospital, where he underwent a battery of tests.
His enlarged organs and abnormal lab work suggested a genetic
disorder, and Alex was referred to Dr. David Kronn, a geneticist at
Westchester Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''The geneticist came to our house on Alex's first birthday,''
Skojec said. ''He gave us the diagnosis, and told us what it meant.
It was anticlimactic in a sense, because I had done a lot of
reading and I already knew what it meant. But actually hearing the
words was like a blow to the stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Skojec was too depressed to get out of bed and go
to work. ''But then my 4-year-old daughter jumped on me and said
'Daddy, you have to do something!' So I decided to get going and do
what I could for Alex.''
</P>
<P>
   Skojec, a trim, athletic 41-year-old, is a self-employed
psychologist in this Hudson Valley town 75 miles north of New York
City. He works with troubled teens, teaches some college courses,
and does psychological evaluations for state and local agencies.
His wife is an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   After his son was diagnosed, Skojec took many months off from
work to focus on searching for information and seeking publicity
for the little-known disease.
</P>
<P>
   He contacted the few researchers investigating sialidosis and
related disorders. He found only the faintest rays of hope.
</P>
<P>
   Since lysosomal storage disorders are caused by the lack of
particular enzymes, researchers have sought treatments in which
enzymes are injected, much as insulin is injected to treat
diabetes. That approach has worked for one of the disorders,
Gaucher disease.
</P>
<P>
   In lysosomal storage disorders that affect the nervous system,
as sialidosis does, enzyme replacement doesn't work because the
enzyme doesn't pass the blood-brain barrier, Kronn said.
</P>
<P>
   Bone marrow transplantation is also being studied as an
experimental treatment for these disorders. But it is a highly
risky procedure, and the potential for success depends on the type
of enzyme deficiency, the age of the patient, the extent of damage
from the disease, and the availability of a suitable donor.
</P>
<P>
   Gene therapy offers perhaps the best hope for patients with
genetic defects like the one that causes sialidosis. The idea is to
replace the bad gene with one that produces the needed enzyme.
</P>
<P>
   But the promise of this new technology is unlikely to become a
reality in time to help Alex. And much of the research has focused
on curing cancer, rather than the rare genetic diseases the field
had first aimed to treat, because a cancer cure would be more
profitable to corporate sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point, there is no treatment aimed at reversing the
course of the disease,'' Kronn said. ''Treatments are mostly
symptomatic. Patients are very prone to infections, they may need
nebulizers or other breathing help. The disease affects multiple
organ systems.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Gene therapy offers the best hope, but it's still in very
early stages,'' Kronn said.
</P>
<P>
   Research on gene therapy in humans was dealt a setback when an
Arizona teen-ager died after undergoing experimental treatment last
fall at the University of Pennsylvania. The Food and Drug
Administration suspended human studies there after the incident,
and concerns were raised about oversight of the field.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, studies were voluntarily halted at several other
institutions because of concerns over safety and effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Skojec contacted Suleiman Igdoura, a genetics researcher at
McMaster University in Canada. Igdoura agreed to culture Alex's
cells to determine the extent of his genetic defect.
</P>
<P>
   Igdoura and colleagues are developing a gene therapy program,
but it will be at least a year or two before it gets to the stage
of human clinical trials, he said. That may be too late for Alex.
</P>
<P>
   ''Normally, we don't get in touch with families of patients this
early in research,'' Igdoura said. But when Skojec contacted him,
Igdoura was moved by his plight. ''We developed a personal
relationship by e-mail and phone. Being a father myself, I feel for
the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Several organizations are working to promote research on
diagnosis and treatments for lysosomal storage disorders, as well
as providing a support and information network for affected
families.
</P>
<P>
   They include the International Society for Mannosidosis and
Related Diseases in Baltimore, Md., and the National Organization
for Rare Disorders (NORD) in New Fairfield, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Skojec is organizing a charity softball tournament in
Poughkeepsie Sept. 9, to raise money for sialidosis research
through donations to NORD.
</P>
<P>
   Skojec knows the odds are against him as he tries to save his
son's life. But he hopes he can help save someone else's child by
promoting awareness of the disease and research towards a cure.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he enjoys every small milestone in his little boy's
life.
</P>
<P>
   ''This summer, he learned to wave good-bye,'' Skojec said
proudly, without a trace of irony.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Allies Speak Against Sanctions  </HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Friends are lining up behind once-isolated
Iraq -- from grass-roots Americans opposed to U.S. policies to the
Venezuelan president, who followed up a recent visit with a plea to
the world Saturday to take note of the suffering here.
</P>
<P>
   The United States remains firmly opposed to any change in the
way the world treats President Saddam Hussein and his government.
But the official Iraqi press is predicting that more world leaders
will follow Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who on Thursday
became the first head of state to visit Iraq since the 1991 Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who is going to be the next hero?'' Babel, Iraq's most
influential newspaper, declared in a front-page editorial Saturday.
Babel is owned by Saddam's son, Odai.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia, the stop after Iraq for Chavez on a tour of fellow
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, was
quick to respond. Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid said after
meeting Chavez that he would visit Baghdad in the coming months and
wanted U.N. sanctions against Iraq ended.
</P>
<P>
   The harsh sanctions have crippled the country's economy and
reduced many to living on meager food rations, drinking unsafe
water and coping with uncertain electricity supplies. Chavez said
in Indonesia on Saturday that the sanctions, which were imposed to
punish Iraq for invading Kuwait in 1990, are unjust and responsible
for the deaths of Iraqi children.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrations against the sanctions were held this month in
front of the White House, and six American members of an
anti-sanctions group are now living with poor families in the
southern Iraqi city of Basra to experience life under sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   But the protests are not confined to grass-roots activists.
</P>
<P>
   Maverick leaders with a record of bucking the U.S. line on
foreign policy are not hard to find. Cuba's Fidel Castro and
Yugoslavia's Slobodan Milosevic are even closer to Saddam than
Chavez. Sudan's Omar el-Bashir and Libya's Col. Moammar Gadhafi
have both expressed a desire to visit Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Despite growing criticism of the sanctions -- even from one-time
proponents like former U.N. weapons inspector Scott Ritter -- the
United States remains firm that they are still necessary to contain
Saddam. The U.S. position is backed by Britain and others who blame
Saddam for the plight of Iraqis, arguing that if he would cooperate
with the United Nations by renouncing nuclear and chemical weapons,
the sanctions and his people's suffering would end.
</P>
<P>
   Two former chief U.N. weapons inspectors, Richard Butler and
Rolf Ekeus, have said they believe Saddam almost certainly has
continued to pursue an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction. And
as long as Washington supports the sanctions, they are unlikely to
be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Washington's only compromise is to support a December
U.N. resolution promising to consider suspending sanctions for
renewable four-month periods. The suspensions would be considered
if Iraq cooperates with the international effort to strip it of
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   In Kuwait on Saturday, a Kuwait University political science
professor described Chavez's visit to Iraq and any visit by the
Indonesian president as ''grave mistakes,'' but he dismissed their
political significance.
</P>
<P>
   The visits ''will not have strong political effects because
Venezuela and Indonesia are not superpowers and have no influence
in the area,'' Abdullah Sahar said. He said Kuwaiti government
officials have remained silent about Chavez's visit because ''they
don't want to become part of the media frenzy surrounding it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Iraq, Saddam said Chavez's visit was proof that the country
was not completely at the mercy of U.S. military and diplomatic
might.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know that we in Iraq do not fear America or anyone dealing
with it,'' al-Jumhouriya, a government newspaper, quoted Saddam as
telling Chavez.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia: End Iraq Sanctions  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL COONEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesia called Saturday for
international sanctions against Iraq to be lifted as Venezuela's
president, fresh from a trip to Baghdad, made an impassioned plea
for the world to take notice of extreme suffering there.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said U.N. sanctions against
Iraq that have been in place since the Persian Gulf War were an
injustice and were causing intense misery to the nation's children.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who has the right to really have an innocent child die
there?'' he said in an emotional plea. ''Let God have pity on the
soul of those who act that way.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the time has come for it to be over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez said his son, who is traveling with him on a tour of OPEC
countries, visited a mosque in Baghdad and saw a naked child dying
from cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't have the medical drugs they need to treat him,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's President Abdurrahman Wahid said after meeting
Chavez at the presidential palace in Jakarta that he would visit
Baghdad in the coming months and wanted sanctions against Iraq
terminated.
</P>
<P>
   ''I share President Chavez's sentiments about the Iraqi
people,'' he said. ''Because of that Indonesia would like to see
the blockade on Iraq to be lifted soon.''
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF says the number of infant and child deaths in Iraq has
doubled in the decade since the sanctions began.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez and Wahid are not alone in calling for an end to strict
trade sanctions that the United Nations says will be in place until
Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   High-profile critics include the Vatican, former weapons
inspector Scott Ritter -- who now says Iraq is essentially disarmed
-- and former U.N. humanitarian coordinators Denis Halliday and Hans
von Sponeck, who resigned in protest over the sanctions policy.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Chavez met with Saddam Hussein during a brief visit
to Baghdad. The trip raised the ire of the United States and
Britain -- the primary backers of the sanctions -- which said they
were concerned about giving the Iraqi president credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's visit to Iraq was the first by a head of state since
the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq laid out the red carpet for Chavez, trumpeting his visit as
a breach of its isolation and a slap in the face for Washington.
Venezuelan officials insist the visit was not about international
politics, but oil, the country's main export.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, who is popular at home, has a record of bucking the
United States in foreign policy. He has nurtured ties with
countries such as Cuba and China and has hailed Libya as a ''model
of participatory democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Whoever is disturbed by my words, I do not care,'' Chavez said
in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez said the main purpose of his trip was to boost the global
clout of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, saying
that after ''40 years of OPEC, a new era begins.''
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to hold a Sept. 27 summit of the heads of state of OPEC
countries in Venezuela, the first such meeting since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez said he invited Saddam to attend the meeting but that the
offer was declined ''for reasons that are obvious to everyone.'' He
said Wahid had had been invited and had accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez is also seeking backing for maintaining the price of oil,
which he says, contrary to the U.S. view, is not too high.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need fair prices for our oil, for our people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez hopes the price of oil will stay at around $25 a barrel.
It is currently selling on world markets at about $27.50 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's foreign ministry spokesman Sulaiman Abdulmanan said
the government strongly supports Chavez on that point.

<HEADLINE> With BC-NY--Travel-Historic Highway  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Heading from east to west, here are some of U.S.
Route 20's
highlights:
<TEXT>
<P>
   -The first formal Shaker Society settlement in America was
started in the Mount Lebanon area.
</P>
<P>
   -The oldest unaltered Episcopal church in the state, built in
1789, is located in Duanesburg.
</P>
<P>
   -In Sharon Springs, the derelict shells of once-majestic hotels
still stand as a silent reminder of the days when tourists came by
the thousands to bathe in the area's natural sulfur and magnesium
springs.
</P>
<P>
   -Cherry Valley was the scene of a famous massacre in 1778 in
which nearly 50 villagers and soldiers were killed by raiders led
by Joseph Brant, a prominent Iroquois chief. A large marble
sarcophagus commemorates the attack.
</P>
<P>
   -Richfield Springs is the home of the Petrified Creatures Museum
of Natural History, chartered in 1934 as one of the oldest hands-on
museums in the state. Visitors can dig for 40 different kinds of
invertebrate fossils on the museum's nearly six acres, which also
include woodland trails, nature paths and life-size dinosaur
statutes.
</P>
<P>
   -In Sangerfield, travelers pass the northern tip of Nine Mile
Swamp, which once served as the hiding place for the infamous
Loomis Gang, which terrorized the countryside from 1848-1866.
</P>
<P>
   -Bouckville, where one of the largest antique shows in the
Eastern United States is staged every August. Nearby is Nichols
Pond, where Samuel de Champlain and an expeditionary force of
French and Hurons attacked a stockaded fort of the Oneida Indians
in October, 1615 - an act that helped drive the Iroquois tribes to
ally with the English during the Revolutionary War.
</P>
<P>
   -Cazenovia was a stagecoach stopover where John Lincklaen built
the Lorenzo House in 1807, an exquisite two-story Georgian
structure that features delicate pilasters, elliptical arches,
gables and a roof parapet.
</P>
<P>
   -Between Pompey and Lafayette, travelers cross the heart of the
ancient Onondaga Indian Nation where the centuries-old Iroquois
Confederacy was born. The area also is one of the leading
apple-producing areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
   -In Cardiff, visitors will learn the history of the Cardiff
Giant, a 10-foot tall hand-carved statue that was buried in the
ground by two 19th-century local hucksters and became regarded as
''America's Greatest Hoax.''
</P>
<P>
   -As travelers pass through Auburn, they can stop at the homes of
Harriet Tubman, who became a national heroine for her pivotal role
in leading slaves to freedom through the Underground Railroad, and
former Secretary of State William H. Seward, who engineered the
purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867.
</P>
<P>
   -Montezuma Swamp, a national wildlife refuge and a birdwatchers'
heaven.
</P>
<P>
   -In Seneca Falls, the birthplace of the women's suffrage
movement, visitors can stop at the National Women's Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   -Waterloo boasts it is the birthplace of the first Memorial Day
observance. It also is the location of the Scythe Tree. Legend says
that in 1861, James Wyburn Johnson, a local farm boy, hung his
scythe on a six-inch poplar sapling until his return from the Civil
War. Johnson was killed in battle and scythe remained while the
tree grew. Today only six inches of blade shows; the wooden handle
having long ago rotted away.
</P>
<P>
   -Geneva is the home of the acclaimed Lake Geneva Inn and the
site of an old Iroquois village. It lies in the heart of the Finger
Lakes region and New York's wine country.
</P>
<P>
   -Town Line is remembered for the fact that a majority of the
townsfolk voted in 1861 to join the South and seceded from the
Union.
</P>
<P>
   -After passing through the Cattaraugus Indian Reservation,
travelers come to Westfield, the original headquarters of the Welch
Grape Juice Company, started in 1896 by Dr. Thomas Branwell Welch
and his son.

<HEADLINE> For New York's Democratic delegates, first lady is a boost  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Four years ago, New York Democrats
practically limped to the convention in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Party faithful were still licking their wounds after losing the
governor's mansion to George Pataki. Republican Rudolph Giuliani
held the reins in New York City. And the GOP takeover of Congress
had weakened the state's Capitol Hill clout.
</P>
<P>
   This year, New York's 294 Democratic delegates head to Hollywood
with a bona fide star of their own - Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates say excitement over the first lady's U.S. Senate
candidacy - fresh off a spurt of other New York Democratic
victories - restores some needed luster to the state party.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were such a dispirited group in 1996 having lost so much.
There is nothing like winning to give a party energy and this time
around we are energized,'' state Party Chairwoman Judith Hope said.
</P>
<P>
   In a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans by an almost
5-3 margin, the loss of Gov. Mario Cuomo, a party icon, to the
unknown Pataki was a watershed event. The state Democratic Party
was broke and in disarray.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas native Judith Hope took over as chairman in 1995 and
gradually the party pulled itself out of the red and began a
grassroots campaign to reinvigorate support.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery saw results when in 1998 Democrats won three out of
four statewide races. Then-Rep. Charles Schumer defeated veteran
GOP Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, Eliot Spitzer edged out Attorney General
Dennis Vacco and Democratic Comptroller H. Carl McCall cruised to
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   But at the moment, at least, Clinton has the spotlight in New
York. That is especially true since the state is considered a lock
for Democratic presidential hopeful Al Gore, even more so after he
picked Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman as his running mate.
Lieberman is certain to appeal to New York's critical Jewish voting
bloc.
</P>
<P>
   ''All eyes are on the Senate race in New York because that's the
race that's close,'' Quinnipiac College pollster Maurice Carroll
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the first lady is only spending a few days at the
convention in Los Angeles the crowds she is drawing and the cash
she is raising rival what Gore will see when he arrives later in
the week. What other U.S. Senate candidate scores a guest spot on
the Jay Leno Show, as the first lady did Friday night?
</P>
<P>
   ''Frankly we were without a star for a while. Now we've got a
world class star in Hillary Clinton,'' Hope added.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans scoffed at that that, taking a swipe at Clinton's
non-New York roots and her prolific fund raising among West Coast
celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, she's a rented star because she's not a New Yorker,
state GOP spokesman Dan Allen said. ''With all the money she has
pouring in from Hollywood I guess she's going home.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the attention lavished on the first lady also
spills over onto New York's second-largest-in-the-nation
delegation. Besides the first lady's Monday night speech, a slate
of other New Yorkers will be featured on the stage of the Staples
Center - although not in coveted prime-time slots.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer and Reps. Charles Rangel, Carolyn Maloney
and Carolyn McCarthy are all speaking.
</P>
<P>
   ''New Yorkers will be very visible in Los Angeles,'' predicted
state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, who is leading the
delegation. ''Hillary Clinton helps that, of course, but New
Yorkers by nature are not shy.''
</P>
<P>
   New York's delegates range in age from their 20s to 88. Most are
either Jewish or Catholic. The delegation is heavy on union members
and local lawmakers and even includes its very own supermodel.
Christie Brinkley, a party activist and fund raiser, is a delegate.
</P>
<P>
   An Associated Press survey of many of the state's delegates
found that most ranked health care as their number one concern,
education was second and the economy third.
</P>
<P>
   State parties were instructed by the Democratic National
Committee to select delegates that reflected the actual ethnic
breakdown of their state, and on this New York was close to the
mark.
</P>
<P>
   The state's delegates are 58 percent white 26 percent African
American, 12 percent Latino and 4 percent Asian. There is one
American Indian. Five percent of the delegates are gay or lesbian.
Half are male and half female.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates will be wined and dined at an endless string of
receptions with a well-known list of corporate sponsors. The first
fete, Sunday night's opening reception for the New York delegation,
is sponsored by Kodak, the state's largest employer.
</P>
<P>
   Silver said he did not feel such corporate sponsorship was
inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's Kodak's way of advertising, getting their name out there
for a relatively inexpensive price,'' he said. ''They are being
good corporate citizens.''

<HEADLINE> Controversy emerges over treatment of infants born with ambiguous genitals </HEADLINE>
By KAREN MATTHEWS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - When Cheryl Chase was born in New Jersey in
1956, the doctors ''kind of freaked out.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They wouldn't let my mother see me and they wouldn't tell her
why,'' she said. ''After three days they decided to tell her that I
was a boy but I was terribly deformed.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase was what doctors call an ''intersex'' baby - meaning she
had ambiguous sexual organs. At least one in 2,000 infants is born
this way, with genitals that do not match their chromosomes or do
not conform to either male or female norms.
</P>
<P>
   In Chase's case, she was raised briefly as a boy, then - after
surgery - as a girl. It has been common for doctors to operate as
soon as possible on such infants, in some cases turning boys into
girls with surgery and female hormones. Traditionally, parents were
told to keep the operation a secret, even when the child grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the practice of early surgery - performed long
before the child can understand - is being questioned. Some
doctors, prompted by angry former patients, are urging a moratorium
on genital surgery that they regard as cosmetic. However, no
consensus yet exists as to when genital surgery is cosmetic and
when it is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's something that I think is going to be argued for a long
time,'' said Dr. Justine Schober, a pediatric urologist in Erie,
Pa., who opposes much of the surgery done in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Chase did not learn of her history until age 22 when she finally
succeeded in obtaining her medical records. She learned she had
been raised as a boy for a year and a half, after which her parents
''found their way to some doctors who were newly minted specialists
in intersex.''
</P>
<P>
   She was diagnosed as a ''true hermaphrodite'' with ovo-testes -
gonads containing both ovarian and testicular tissue. She also had
a uterus, a vagina and ''pretty typical female genitals except for
a large clitoris.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They determined that I had ovaries and could get pregnant,''
Chase said. ''Then they closed my abdomen and cut off my clitoris.
... They told my parents that they had discovered that I wasn't
really a boy but I was a girl. ... They told them they should
change my name, move to another town and not tell anyone where they
had gone.''
</P>
<P>
   After learning her past, Chase founded the Intersex Society of
North America in 1993, hoping to end the shame and secrecy
surrounding intersex and halt the type of surgery that had left her
scarred and unable to have an orgasm.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the second half of the 20th century doctors have treated
intersex as something that is so freakish that it renders the
intersex person ineligible for membership in society,'' she said.
''And because it is so freakish, ordinary ethics don't apply.''
</P>
<P>
   Danette Ivey is trying to help others who, like her, were born
with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, or CAH, an enzyme deficiency
that can be fatal without regular doses of steroids. The condition,
the most common intersex diagnosis, often causes a baby girl's
genitals to be ''virilized'' - to look something like a boy's.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1966 in Lubbock, Texas, Ivey had nine surgeries. She
says some were necessary - her urethra had to be repositioned - and
some not - her clitoris was either removed or ''buried so far that
it's not even possible to find it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You feel totally violated,'' she said. ''You lose all control
of your body because you have your parents and the doctor saying
'we're doing this to make you normal.' In my mind I was normal
until they started cutting on me.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of my life I wished I was dead,'' said Ivey, who lives
outside of Houston where she runs an Internet message board for
people with CAH and delivers pizza for a living.
</P>
<P>
   Her message to parents contemplating genital surgery for
children is: ''Don't do anything that is not medically necessary.
Let the child decide when they are older. Because once you do the
surgery you can't go back.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been medical practice since the 1950s to operate on a boy
who has a penis that doctors feel will be too small for intercourse
or a girl whose clitoris is regarded as too long.
</P>
<P>
   Medical textbooks say that at birth the penis should be at least
an inch long. If it's not, doctors remove the penis and testicles
and administer female hormones. The child is then raised as a girl.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors would reduce the size of a girl's clitoris if it's more
than 3/8 inch long. They also may enlarge a girl's vagina if they
think it will not comfortably accommodate a penis when she grows
up.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of CAH, the clitoris sometimes ''looks like a little
penis,'' said Dr. Ian Aaronson, a pediatric urologist at the
Medical University of South Carolina and the chairman of the North
American Task Force on Intersex.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most mothers intuitively say, 'Well, she doesn't look like a
little girl,''' Aaronson said. ''Most doctors would feel
uncomfortable leaving children with grossly ambiguous genitalia, to
grow up through school with something unusual between their legs.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Lee, a pediatric endocrinologist at Hershey Medical
Center in Hershey, Pa., said he strives for ''a balanced
perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My position would be that if the clitoris is enlarged but
still has the structure of a clitoris, that one ought not to rush
into surgery,'' Lee said. But he said surgery may be indicated
''when the genitals are such that they do not look female or
male.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee conceded that years ago, doctors operating on a child's
clitoris made scant effort to spare nerve endings and preserve
orgasmic potential. ''The big emphasis was on the appearance of the
genitalia,'' he said. ''Sadly so.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, he said, ''I'm confident that there is a better
result.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are less confident.
</P>
<P>
   ''The truth is we have no long-term outcome studies, so we
really don't know if surgery hurts or helps,'' said Schober, the
urologist from Erie, Pa. ''It may normalize appearance, but there's
more to sexuality than appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   The practice of assigning female sex to boys with small penises
was pioneered by sexologist John Money at Johns Hopkins Medical
Center in Baltimore. It is easier to create a vagina and labia than
enlarge a penis, and Money believed gender in infancy was so
malleable that a genetic male consistently raised as a girl would
adapt to life as a female.
</P>
<P>
   The theory gained a boost from one highly publicized case of a
boy who was changed to a girl in 1967 after his penis was destroyed
in a botched circumcision. Money described the child as a typical,
well-adjusted little girl.
</P>
<P>
   The theory was discredited when that child, now an adult named
David Reimer, disclosed that he had reassigned himself as a male at
age 14 and was married and living happily as a man.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, the pediatric endocrinologist, said that when he received
his medical training in the late 1960s and early '70s ''the
recommendation was to reassign the sex of a boy with micropenis,''
but he thought the practice had gone out of fashion in the last 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. William Reiner, a psychiatrist and pediatric urologist
at Johns Hopkins, said it is still going on, even though recent
research indicates that men with small penises can function quite
well as males.
</P>
<P>
   Reiner said he has found 36 children who were castrated and
assigned as girls either in his practice or in his research, and
two-thirds of them have switched back to being boys.
</P>
<P>
   He said that once the child is told what happened, ''not only
does the child himself recognize that he was male, but often his
classmates have always recognized he was male.''
</P>
<P>
   Schober said textbooks still recommend raising a boy with a
small penis as a girl.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the 1992 edition of Campbell's Urology advises
that ''if the penis does not respond to testosterone, gender
reassignment probably should be performed.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was like a quick fix,'' said Schober. ''A quick, easy
fix.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase added, ''Part of the problem is that (doctors) wanted a
simple answer by which they could use the tools they like to use,
which is medical intervention and surgery, to make this go away.''
</P>
<P>
   These days the treatment of intersex children is in such a state
of flux that parents get opposite advice depending on which doctor
they consult.
</P>
<P>
   When Kelley Schultz's twins were born in 1998 she didn't notice
anything odd about her daughter Madison's genitals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just don't think I really knew what they were supposed to
look like,'' said Schultz, a corporate meeting planner from the
Seattle area. ''I never thought anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But at 6 months Madison was diagnosed with CAH. (Her twin
brother was not affected.) She had a mild case, but a team of
specialists at Children's Hospital in Seattle determined that her
clitoris was too large and she should have surgery to reduce it.
</P>
<P>
   ''My pediatrician was really against it,'' said Schultz, who
agreed to have the surgery performed when Madison was 18 months.
''It was a really hard decision because there wasn't anything wrong
with her in her functioning. ... But it did not look normal, and
they could fix it, so why not fix it?''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ''I think it's fine if a child has big ears or a
funny-looking nose, but I think that when you are dealing with
sexuality and those type of things, if you wait for your 13- or
14-year-old child to make that decision, there could already be
psychological damage done.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherie, a Californian who asked that her last name not be used,
gave birth in 1993 to a son with a small penis, undescended
testicles and no fully formed scrotum. It took three or four weeks
to determine that he had XY chromosomes and was a genetic male.
</P>
<P>
   Cherie said one ''crotchety old urologist'' suggested raising
the baby as a girl. But he was overruled by doctors at the
University of California at Davis who advised that ''there's no
reason to turn this child into a girl just because he has a small
penis.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherie, who counsels other parents through the Ambiguous
Genitalia Support Network, said her son is a happy 7-year-old boy
but if he decides to be a girl later on that will be up to him.
</P>
<P>
   ''My goal,'' she said, ''is for everyone to do what's in the
best interest of the child, to put the needs of their child ahead
of everything else.''

<HEADLINE> Taliban Rulers Close Bath Houses  </HEADLINE>
By AMIR SHAH
<TEXT>
<P>
   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -- Afghanistan's Taliban militia rulers
closed public bath houses in the war-battered Afghan capital,
saying Saturday that Islam forbids men to publicly display their
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The 30 bath houses, where dozens of men would wash together,
closed last week following an edict from the hard-line Muslim
Taliban's religious police.
</P>
<P>
   ''Islam doesn't allow even men to expose their bodies in
public,'' Ahmedullah Sahafi, a spokesman for the capital, Kabul,
told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The poorly lit bathing rooms accommodated 80 to 100 men -- mostly
the city's poorest, who do not have running water. Men and young
boys wore shorts or tied towels around their waists while bathing
in the giant tubs. Baths typically cost about 18 cents per person.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, who have little money to run the war-torn country,
say they will build small, single-occupancy public bath houses to
replace them. Public baths for women were closed in 1996, when the
Taliban took over Kabul.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban control more than 90 percent of Afghanistan and
espouse a harsh brand of Islam. Men are forbidden to wear shorts or
sleeveless shirts in public. They also are forbidden to shave.
</P>
<P>
   Women are not allowed to work, girls older than 8 may not attend
school and women in public must wear a burqa, a head-to-toe shroud
that covers the body. State officials roam the streets looking for
women violating the edicts; violators are publicly beaten.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed Zahir, a university teacher, lamented the loss of the
bath houses.
</P>
<P>
   ''One by one we are losing all our facilities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic scholars in neighboring Pakistan say the Taliban's laws
reflect tribal traditions more than Islamic tenets. But the Taliban
remain undeterred, despite bitter criticism from the international
community.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't allow anything which is contrary to Islam,'' Sahafi
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many neighborhoods in Kabul are without running water. The
city's infrastructure was destroyed during a bitter civil war
between warring Islamic factions who ruled the capital between 1992
and 1996. A drought has compounded the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul Qayyum, who owns a public bath house, said people prefer
collective bathing to individual baths.
</P>
<P>
   ''My business has suffered badly since the ban,'' he said.
''People don't like cubicles, because they are cold and have
limited water supply.''
</P>
<P>
   Deposed President Burhanuddin Rabbani and his military chief,
Ahmed Shah Massood, lead an anti-Taliban alliance made up of the
groups that once battled each other in Kabul. They are now united
against the Taliban, but they control less than 10 percent of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Gibbs was last surviving founder of American Diabetes Association  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - Dr. Charles Brooke Flint Gibbs, one of 32
founders of the American Diabetes Association, has died.
</P>
<P>
   He was 105. Gibbs died in his sleep Aug. 2. He had been the last
surviving founding member of the 60-year-old American Diabetes
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs practiced medicine in Rochester from 1921 to 1980, in
later years becoming the oldest living physician in Monroe County
and the oldest living alumnus of the Syracuse University College of
Medicine, having graduated in 1919.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs made daily house calls over 59 years. When he retired on
Jan. 1, 1980, he wrote each patient a personal letter and met with
each to recommend another doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs was born Sept. 27, 1894, in Black River, Jefferson County.
His father was a cabinetmaker. His mother was a teacher and
part-time reporter for the Watertown Times whose pay, 5 cents per
column inch, helped put Gibbs and his younger brother through
medical school.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1920s, he worked with pioneering diabetes researcher
John Murlin, whose University of Rochester team was trying to
isolate insulin. They were narrowly beaten by University of Toronto
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1925, the year the University of Rochester's medical school
was founded, Dr. Gibbs opened the area's first clinic for
diabetics, at Rochester General Hospital. The next year, he became
chief of Strong Memorial Hospital's first diabetes clinic.
</P>
<P>
   The Charles B.F. Gibbs Library at the University of Rochester
serves the endocrinology department.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs is survived by three children, 12 grandchildren, and 14
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service will be held at 2 p.m. Aug. 23 at the Third
Presbyterian Church, 4 Meigs St. Burial will be private.

<HEADLINE> Peace Deal Disillusions Burundians  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) -- Like many Burundians, Generose Gasinzi
was hopeful when peace talks began between the Tutsi-led government
and the Hutu rebels. She thought it could mean an end to the
country's 7-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   But with fighting continuing and both sides saying they can't
reach a deal by the Aug. 28 signing deadline set by former South
African President Nelson Mandela, the 35-year-old Tutsi government
employee has lost all hope that peace is forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's tense and people are worried,'' said Gasinzi, who has
lost friends and relatives to the conflict. About 200,000 people
have been killed since 1993, when Burundi's first free elections
collapsed amid ethnic violence.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in Burundi knows that power-sharing is the only way to
end the war. Any proposal must both end the Hutu rebellion and
ensure that the minority Tutsis can yield their grip on the army,
government and economy without fear of persecution.
</P>
<P>
   But as in all peace agreements, the details and the spirit are
what matter most.
</P>
<P>
   ''Having a document is irrelevant if we don't share a common
vision,'' said Terence Nahimana, a Hutu member of parliament. ''In
advanced societies, whoever is in power doesn't affect whether my
children will go to school. In Burundi, our children going to
school will depend on the people in power.''
</P>
<P>
   Since independence from Belgium in 1962, the Tutsi minority has
gradually assumed control of the country following several abortive
Hutu uprisings. Burundi's lucrative tea and coffee exports have
been largely controlled by the Tutsi elite, who don't want to lose
their privileged positions.
</P>
<P>
   For middle-class public servants like Gasinzi, the fear of Hutu
domination is real. When Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu, won Burundi's
first democratic elections seven years ago, many of her Tutsi
colleagues lost their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   When news spread that Ndadaye had been assassinated by Tutsi
paratroopers, her uncle was lynched in Kamenge, a mixed
neighborhood in the nation's capital. Hutu militia fighters set up
roadblocks and started expelling the Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
   Many Hutus insist they have been victims of a Tutsi-controlled
political system that has oppressed them for decades and that
robbed them of the 1993 vote. They accuse the Tutsi-dominated army
of killing their friends and families in revenge for rebel attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In recent fighting, 50 Hutu civilians were killed in a church
and 27 army cadets died in an ambush.
</P>
<P>
   The 19 Burundian political parties and interest groups meeting
in Arusha, Tanzania, this coming week to work out a peace deal have
split into Hutu and Tutsi blocks. They have been unable to agree on
who will lead a three-year transition period up to new elections.
</P>
<P>
   They also disagree about whether to call the 1993 killings of
Tutsi civilians a genocide orchestrated by Hutu authorities -- an
important political admission demanded by Tutsis. Hutu negotiators
have balked at the suggestion, hoping instead to free 11,000 Hutu
prisoners the government says are responsible for the killings.
Hutu rebels consider the prisoners political detainees.
</P>
<P>
   The army also insists that a cease-fire should precede the
signing of any deal. The rebels want one to come after the
agreement is signed.
</P>
<P>
   Nahimana said most of the energy at the talks has been wasted on
individuals jostling for positions.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is competition for power in the presidency, parliament
and government. But there is no cooperation,'' Nahimana said.
</P>
<P>
   Gasinzi, meanwhile, has lost patience with the talks and the
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have seen everything so far -- a Hutu president, army coup,
politicians lying to our faces,'' she said. ''What can happen that
hasn't happened so far?''

	   NEW YORK (AP) - U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, noting that some New
Yorkers pay as much as $60,000 more than necessary over the course
of a 30-year mortgage loan, called Saturday for consumers to
receive access to their credit ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, D-N.Y., announced plans for right-to-know legislation
that would allow consumers to review their credit ratings before
taking out a home loan.
</P>
<P>
   The result would be twofold, he said: It would allow consumers
to verify that credit information was correct, and it would give
them leverage in securing a better loan rate.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, thousands of New Yorkers with excellent credit pay
between $140 and $175 more per month than necessary on their
mortgages because they're unaware that they qualify for lower cost
loans. Consumers currently cannot review their credit ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ''This legislation will lift the veil of secrecy over credit
scores and create greater opportunity for securing a home mortgage
at considerably less expense,'' Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   For a home owner paying $175 extra per month on a mortgage, that
totals up to $60,000 in unnecessary payments over the course of a
typical 30-year loan.
</P>
<P>
   The Schumer bill is based largely on bipartisan legislation
recently approved by the California state assembly's banking
committee. Schumer's legislation would require all lenders to
provide a credit rating to each loan applicant, with an explanation
of how the rating was calculated.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's call for legislation was supported by both consumer
advocates and realtors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Realtors believe that every citizen should enjoy the
fundamental right to review the results of the mathematical
modeling that determine the award of a home mortgage,'' said Lee
Verstandig of the National Association of Realtors.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Criticizes Saudi Arabia, Kuwait  </HEADLINE>
By WAIEL FALEH
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq's two highest councils met Saturday
with President Saddam Hussein and blasted Kuwait and Saudi Arabia
for continued aggression against Iraq, the official Iraqi News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting discussed how to ''expose the aggression which
destroys Iraqi properties with American backing and Saudi-Kuwaiti
support,'' said a statement after the meeting of the Regional
Command of the al-Baath ruling party and the Revolutionary Command
Council.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has criticized Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, along with Turkey,
for allowing American and British allies to use their bases for
daily flights over the no-fly zones of northern and southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq also blames Kuwaitis and Saudis for the U.N. sanctions
imposed on its 22 million people since 1990. ''The Saudis are first
in aggression followed by the Kuwaiti rulers in treason,'' said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting said the aggression must be exposed to
''international and Arab public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's high-level meeting took place one day after two
people were killed and 19 injured in an allied airstrike on the
city of Samawa, 270 kilometers (168 miles) south of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq says allied airstrikes have killed over 300 citizens and
injured over 900 others. The allies dispute these figures.
</P>
<P>
   An official of the Air Defense Command said the strikes only
served to injure ''more innocent civilians.'' He said many
government offices, including a police building, were bombed in the
Friday evening airstrike.
</P>
<P>
   INA reported that the bombing also hit the main food ration
distribution center and six homes.
</P>
<P>
   The news agency said the Friday strikes were in response to
Saddam's Tuesday speech in which he said his Gulf neighbors had
''sold their souls'' to the United States and Israel. An unnamed
military spokesman said the strikes ''show how deep the conspiracy
is'' between Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the allies.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent Saturday to the United Nations, Foreign
Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf accused the Saudi and Kuwaiti
governments of ''providing logistical support for the American and
British forces, making them contributing partners in the
aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   The foreign minister demanded that the U.N. Security Council
''rise up to its responsibilities in keeping the international
security and peace by stopping the continued aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   He also renewed Iraq's rejection of the no-fly zones, saying
they violate national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain have been enforcing zones since
the end of the 1991 Gulf War. The zones were set up to protect
Shiite Muslim rebels in the south and Kurdish insurgents in the
north from attacks by Iraq's army.

Poughkeepsie Journal
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. (AP) - The wait for organ transplants has
grown significantly in New York state, as organ donations fail to
keep pace with a growing demand for transplants.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 9,616 organ transplants in the state, the
Poughkeepsie Journal found that patients waited about 200 days
longer in 1998 than in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The average waiting time for those who received transplants in
1998 was 485 days - about 1.4 years, according to a computer
analysis of records provided by the United Network for Organ
Sharing, which coordinates organ transplants under a contract with
the federal government. UNOS records included waiting times for
about 80 percent of transplanted patients.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found:
</P>
<P>
   -The wait grew most for people receiving liver transplants,
rising more than 300 percent, from 60 days in 1990 to 254 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   -Waiting times rose 60 percent for kidneys, the most common
organ transplanted, often from living donors, to 680 days in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   -Heart recipients waited 88 percent longer - 263 days in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   -Patients also waited longer for less commonly transplanted
organs such as lungs and pancreases.
</P>
<P>
   ''Waiting times have gone up really across the board,'' said
UNOS Spokesman Joel Newman. New York has the longest wait
nationally for kidneys among blood type O and A patients, who
comprise 80 percent of recipients, according to a 1999 report by
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   The number of transplants at medical centers statewide grew 58
percent, from about 800 in 1990 to 1,300 in 1998. But as science
and medicine have improved the odds for transplant patients, the
number of organ donations has remained flat - at about 5,800 donors
from cadavers a year nationwide. That leaves many patients waiting.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just don't have enough organs,'' said Dr. Ashok Shah,
medical director of renal services at St. Francis Hospital in
Poughkeepsie.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, more than 4,000 people on transplant waiting lists
nationwide died because there weren't enough donated organs.
</P>
<P>
   In New York state, approximately 7,000 people are waiting for an
organ transplant, among roughly 70,000 Americans waiting
nationwide. Thousands more wait for corneal, bone and other tissue
transplants.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Backs Homes For Teen Parents  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- President Clinton ordered the government
Saturday to cooperate with nonprofit groups, church organizations
and others to give teen-age parents safe, supportive
''second-chance homes.''
</P>
<P>
   The homes help teen mothers who cannot live with their own
parents. They teach teen mothers how to be good parents and give
them reasons not to become pregnant again. Some also bring teen
fathers into the equation by teaching them how to be parents or
training them for a job.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and Sen. Joe Lieberman support such
homes, Clinton said in his weekly radio address. Gore and Lieberman
will be nominated next week as the Democratic presidential and vice
presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''The teens get the help they need to finish school. They learn
how to care for their children and manage a budget,'' Clinton said.
The radio address was broadcast from Los Angeles, where Clinton is
attending a weekend parties and fund-raisers in advance of his
Monday night address to the Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged Congress to provide $25 million to start more
second-chance homes.
</P>
<P>
   He also directed the secretaries of the Health and Human
Services and Housing and Urban Development departments to make it
easier for community and religious groups to acquire vacant or
foreclosed property to accommodate more teen parents. The
government, he said, would give communities a road map of federal
and state resources they can use to set up more of the homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I read of one young Massachusetts woman who got pregnant at 14
and soon was estranged from her family with no place to live,''
Clinton said. ''With the help of a second-chance home, she got back
on her feet, trained at a community college and has left welfare to
become a proud, working mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hailed recent declines in the birth rate among American
teen-agers but noted that girls and young women still have close to
a half-million babies a year.
</P>
<P>
   He cited a report this week by the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention that teen-agers are having babies at the
lowest rate in at least 60 years. For every 1,000 girls aged 15 to
19, there were about 50 births last year, the lowest level since
the statistic was first recorded six decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   If the teen birth rate had remained at its 1991 peak, teen
mothers would have given birth to 120,000 more babies this year,
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the drop-off in teen births, analysts said the HIV
virus and AIDS became mainstream enough in the 1990s to scare
teen-agers, while awareness of other sexually transmitted diseases
was at an all-time high. They said advertising campaigns, community
awareness groups and even the experience of seeing friends have
children encouraged teens to be more careful -- or stop having sex
entirely.

<HEADLINE> More British Pigs Face Slaughter  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Thousands more pigs could be slaughtered as
British authorities work to contain an outbreak of swine fever,
agriculture officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Some 6,000 animals have been killed already, and Belgium, Spain
and the Netherlands have imposed a ban on the import of British
pigs that is expected to last for several weeks. The moves come
after cases of swine fever were found on three farms in eastern
England this week.
</P>
<P>
   Pigs on five other farms linked to the breeding unit where the
disease is believed to have originated will also have to be killed,
the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said.
</P>
<P>
   Swine fever is lethal to pigs but harmless to humans. It killed
millions of pigs in mainland Europe during the 1990s, but the
British cases are the first here in 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   Some 15 percent of Britain's pig production is exported, mostly
to Europe, generating $190 million annually.

<HEADLINE> ETA Supporters Wage Basque Attacks  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL WOOLLS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BILBAO, Spain (AP) --Several thousand people gathered Saturday in
this northern Spanish city, chanting in memory of four members of
the Basque separatist group ETA who died when their explosive-laden
car blew up.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd chanted ''Gora ETA,'' Basque for ''long live ETA.'' On
a stage sat poster-sized photos of the four ETA members who died
Monday. They were surrounded by dozens of Basque flags with their
red, green and white colors.
</P>
<P>
   Arnaldo Otegi, a leader of the pro-Basque independence
coalition, addressed the crowd in a square next to the Nervion
River. He pointed to the photographs, saying it was a pity that
people so young died in the conflict. Two of the dead were 22 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did not choose violence,'' Otegi said, ''but there is no
other path.''
</P>
<P>
   ETA's armed drive for an independent homeland carved out of
parts of northern Spain and southern France has claimed nearly 800
lives since it began in 1968. In the Basque language, ETA stands
for Basque Freedom and Homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe the four ETA members who died had intended to
launch an attack on Bilbao. On Wednesday, prosecutors filed a suit
against Otegi, accusing him of advocating terrorism after he
described the four who died as ''colleagues and patriots.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Saturday, suspected supporters of the armed group threw
a firebomb at a Civil Guard member's home in the latest in a series
of small-scale attacks in the northern Basque region.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was hurt in the incident in Vitoria, the region's
capital. The house, belonging to a Civil Guard member who was not
identified, was damaged by fire as the guardsman's 17-year-old son
was inside the building.
</P>
<P>
   During the past three days, assailants have thrown Molotov
cocktails at bank offices, burnt some 13 buses and dozens of cars
and attacked automatic teller machines in different Basque cities.
They have been protesting the deaths of the four suspected ETA
members.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, ETA claimed responsibility for 12 attacks between
early May and late July. But the armed group did not mention a
shooting of an army officer Wednesday or two car bombings that
killed a Basque business leader and injured 11 people Tuesday.
Police and politicians have blamed ETA.

<HEADLINE> Shroud of Turin Displayed in Italy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TURIN, Italy (AP) -- The Shroud of Turin was unveiled Saturday,
beginning a two-month Holy Year display with a presentation before
6,000 young pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
   At the ceremony, caretakers said they were open to new
scientific study of the 14-foot, 3-inch strip of linen, which the
faithful believe wrapped Christ after he was taken off the cross.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Church is not afraid of science,'' Turin Archbishop
Severino Poletto told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Italian TV broadcast live from the Turin cathedral as clerics
presented the icon in an aluminum and plastic frame before pilgrims
from around the world. Many of the pilgrims had just arrived for
Pope John Paul II's World Youth Day in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul was among those traveling to Turin last year for the
shroud's first public display in two decades. He said at the time
he believed more research should be done.
</P>
<P>
   Believers say the mysterious shroud bears the blood and imprint
of Christ, beaten, tortured and crucified. But a carbon dating test
ended in 1988 with a scientific team declaring that the shroud
apparently came from medieval times.
</P>
<P>
   Disputes have flourished since then on the validity of that
study and others, including one by researchers at The Hebrew
University. The latter study concluded last year that pollen and
plant images on the shroud showed it originated in the area around
Jerusalem sometime before the eighth century.
</P>
<P>
   The display ends Oct. 22.

<HEADLINE> Pope Welcomes Youth Day Volunteers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Upbeat and joking, Pope John Paul II on
Saturday welcomed more than 20,000 young volunteers lending a hand
with the coming crowds of next week's World Youth Day.
</P>
<P>
   The encounter with the blue T-shirt-clad volunteers brought a
rare series of smiles to the 80-year-old pontiff's face -- as well
as a rare papal plug. John Paul recognized an Italian catering
company that is helping to feed the 1.2 million-plus young pilgrims
expected here.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even the Pope's getting something out of it!'' John Paul said,
getting surprised laughs from the crowd. The Italian company
deserved note for taking care of the food, he said -- ''delicious!
At least, we think it will be.''
</P>
<P>
   World Youth Day is actually a week of events running from
Tuesday to Aug. 20. It has long promised to be a centerpiece of the
Roman Catholic Church's Holy Year, and with the energy and
enjoyment John Paul has always gotten out of young people, it
stands to be a highlight for the aging pontiff as well.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms similar to those of the neurological disorder
Parkinson's have drained much of the emotion from the pope's face
over the years. The woodenness makes the smiles and even grins that
young people -- squirming children or enthusiastic teens -- still
bring to the pope's face that much more noticeable.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul spoke at his summer palace at Castel Gandolfo, which
he will share with about 15 young pilgrims coming from Tahiti,
Congo, Sri Lanka, Canada and points in Italy for Youth Day. Giant
TV screens carried Saturday's greeting to other volunteers in St.
Peter's Square.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul started the youth day tradition in 1985, then took it
around the world. Other youth days have been held in Argentina,
Spain, Poland, the Philippines and France.

<HEADLINE> New farm preservation revives issue of forced zoning for farmland  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman last week kicked off
a groundbreaking approach to how farms can be preserved in New
Jersey by letting town and county officials get more involved in
planning.
</P>
<P>
   But for some farm advocates, fear is creeping in over just whose
ground they intend to break.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of well-meaning people out there who don't
have a clue what the hell they are doing,'' said John Rigolizzo
Jr., a farmer and the elected president of the New Jersey Farm
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The new program is designed to give towns or counties Planning
Incentive Grants, which go by the acronym PIG. These grants are
supposed to let local officials preserve lots of farms with less
money up front, provided the farms are located near or next to each
other.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Whitman signed the PIG law. Last Wednesday, she
signed the first bill to put PIG into effect, doling out $9.8
million in grants to 12 mostly rural towns.
</P>
<P>
   Rigolizzo said the Farm Bureau worked on the PIG law and
supports it. But he also said this new concept could create a
dangerous temptation for local officials to use zoning regulations
to specify where farms ought to be.
</P>
<P>
   While such zones might sound like common sense, farm advocates
say they are fatal to agriculture. Rigolizzo said changes in
land-use law that hurt the real estate value of a farmer's land can
drive him out of business. ''This is something we are watching very
closely,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Republican lawmaker who thought up the program has
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblywoman Connie Myers, R-Hunterdon, said her goal was to
get more farmers enrolled in open-space preservation more quickly.
Eight of the 12 towns approved Wednesday for PIG funding are in her
legislative district.
</P>
<P>
   But since the enabling law was signed last year, she has had
worries about how the Whitman administration has been intending to
use it.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem is the folks in the governor's office who came
from an environmental background, not an agriculture background,''
Myers said. ''They believe that zoning is the answer, not purchase.
They are focused on that, they are focused on maximizing that and
minimizing the spending.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers said even Whitman's remarks as she signed the PIG funding
law were unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   ''She never talked about the value of the program as I see it.
She talked about planning and preserving contiguous acres, but she
did not talk about acquisition up front,'' Myers said.
</P>
<P>
   Rigolizzo admits there is no evidence the PIG law will lead to
new zoning laws. In fact, it is illegal in New Jersey to use
agricultural zoning to designate farmland. But similar steps can be
taken that have roughly the same effect, and farmers fear if this
occurs it will wreck the collateral value of their only business
asset.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers need land value to stay in business because they need
loans to stay in business, and their land is their collateral. Less
collateral forces the farmer to pay unaffordable interest rates,
provided they can even find a bank to give them a loan. ''Many
farmers pay more in interest every year than most people earn,''
Rigolizzo said.
</P>
<P>
   Fears of land-value problems can snowball, prompting farmers to
sell to developers and get out while they can, even if the fears
are unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   Rigolizzo said the PIG program does specifically provide for
such zoning changes. On paper.
</P>
<P>
   ''The potential danger there is that you run into problems with
the local planning boards that might do something a little more
with it. They were always in the back of my mind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, some 66,000 acres have been preserved through the
farmland preservation. The pace has accelerated sharply since
Whitman announced her open-space goal of preserving a million
acres, and now PIG is targeting another 14,000 acres of farms.
</P>
<P>
   Farms are preserved by changing the property deed to prevent
development. The farmer gets paid cash for this loss, keeps the
land and may continue to farm it or even sell it, as long as it
remains open. The collateral value of the land is reduced, but the
farmer gets an interest-earning cash reserve to compensate for it.
</P>
<P>
   Rigolizzo is a fifth-generation vegetable grower in Winslow
Township who began helping work his father's 400 acres 40 years ago
at age 7. He said few elected officials really understand farming,
and that few of his tractor-driving colleagues take the necessary
steps to make sure that their mayors and residential neighbors are
educated about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''The average person who reads the paper on Sunday morning
hasn't the faintest idea of how we stay in business, what affects
our business,'' Rigolizzo said.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, farmers are not quick to sell to developers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many people are afraid that farmers will pick up and go at the
drop of the hat if someone offers them the right price,'' Rigolizzo
said. ''But for the most part farmers are stubborn and eternally
optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Most farmers would like to be able to stay on the farm until
the day they die. It is in their blood, it is in their life, and
you will take what Mother Nature throws at you as long as you can
send your kids to school, keep your wife in clothes and throw some
paint on the house,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And ultimately it does make sense to have farming zones - as
long as zoning laws are not used to create them.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you are farming a farm and you are surrounded by houses,
you are not going to be farming for long because people don't like
what you do, they don't like the dust, they don't like the
irrigation, they don't like that we use pesticides,'' Rigolizzo
said.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor writes novel based on Delaware baby-dumping case  </HEADLINE>
By SEAN O'SULLIVAN
The (Wilmington) News Journal
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) - This month, a new book will hit stores
involving a suburban, middle-class teen-ager who faces the death
penalty after dumping her newborn in a trash bin in a small
Delaware town.
</P>
<P>
   The book, ''True Justice,'' is by Robert K. Tanenbaum, one of
the attorneys who represented Amy Grossberg, the suburban,
middle-class teen-ager from Wyckoff, N.J., who faced the death
penalty after she dumped her newborn in a trash bin in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   It is, according to the author, a work of fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Tanenbaum said he drew from a number of other baby-dumping cases
across the country, not just the story of Amy Grossberg.
</P>
<P>
   He said this book is meant to be a discussion of moral and
ethical implications. '''True Justice' deals with how these cases
should be handled,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But in Delaware?
</P>
<P>
   It just fit, he said.
</P>
<P>
   This blend of fiction and Tanenbaum's real-life legal practice
is nothing new. Tanenbaum has written 13 other books based on his
legal career, which includes time as a New York prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys involved in the Grossberg case said they fully
expected Tanenbaum to write a book about the case at its
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   And with Amy Grossberg and one-time boyfriend and co-defendant
Brian Peterson Jr., also of Wyckoff, N.J., deciding to remain
silent since their release from jail earlier this year, it may well
be the last word on the case, which gained nationwide attention in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how the book is written, Tanenbaum could be on
shaky ethical and legal ground, according to legal ethicists.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gilbert Johnston, dean of the John Marshall Law School in
Chicago, said Tanenbaum might be ''playing on the margin of the
spirit of the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though ''True Justice'' is labeled fiction, Grossberg could
have an ethics complaint against Tanenbaum if he discloses any
confidences or secrets, said John Corkery, a professor of law and
assistant dean at Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   However, from a description of the book, Corkery said he did not
see a clear breach of ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Tanenbaum said he did not get the book approved by the
Grossbergs. ''I assume they will read it with the rest of
America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he listens to his conscience when writing his
books. ''I don't clear them with other people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Tanenbaum said he still feels strongly about
Grossberg's defense.
</P>
<P>
   Although he agreed to a plea deal in which Grossberg admitted to
manslaughter, Tanenbaum maintains that prosecutors got it wrong. He
said Grossberg's baby was stillborn and that Grossberg was
suffering from seizures that rendered her incapacitated that night.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and investigators disagreed with his account.
</P>
<P>
   They described Grossberg as the driving force in the
relationship and said she was significantly responsible for the
events that led to the death of her son.
</P>
<P>
   Early on Nov. 12, 1996, Grossberg, then 18, called Peterson,
also 18, to drive to Newark from Gettysburg, Pa. The two went to a
motel room, where Grossberg gave birth to a baby boy. The baby was
then put in a trash bag and thrown into a trash bin behind the
motel.
</P>
<P>
   The pair were later caught, after Grossberg was taken to the
hospital with postnatal complications.
</P>
<P>
   After both reached plea agreements with prosecutors, a judge
cited Grossberg's apparent lack of remorse when sentencing her to
30 months in jail, six months longer than Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   Grossberg was released May 10 after serving 24 months. Peterson,
who also pleaded guilty to manslaughter, was released Jan. 5 after
serving 17 months. Both received time off their sentences for good
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Tanenbaum said Grossberg's treatment was unusual and harsh
because Delaware Attorney General M. Jane Brady was playing
politics with the case, citing her appearance on the television
show ''Geraldo'' shortly after the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Brady's office would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   According to the description of Tanenbaum's book at Amazon.com,
the novel begins by following the story of New York district
attorney Butch Karp, a recurring character in Tanenbaum's work, who
is prosecuting a poor Hispanic girl for murder after she dumps her
baby in the trash.
</P>
<P>
   The plot takes a turn for the familiar, however, when Karp's
wife, Marlene, accepts her own private-practice client.
</P>
<P>
   That case ''takes her a few hundred miles south to a small
Delaware town, where another baby has been found, its lifeless body
placed in a motel trash bin by two scared kids. Marlene is
representing the mother, a doe-eyed, middle-class suburban teen who
claims the baby was stillborn.''
</P>
<P>
   Further complications come from ''a politically ambitious local
prosecutor who is pressing to make it a case of capital murder''
and the infant's father, who is ''singing a different song, placing
all of the blame on the girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanenbaum said he did not take the case for the purpose of
writing the book. He said the book grew out of his experiences in
Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted desperately to try the case,'' said Tanenbaum, who
said he only relented because Grossberg's parents wanted to take
the safe route. When you go to a jury, he said, you never know what
will happen.
</P>
<P>
   So does he finally get to try the case in ''True Justice?''
</P>
<P>
   ''You'll have to read the book,'' Tanenbaum said.

<HEADLINE> Two more New Yorkers test positive for the West Nile virus  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Two more Staten Island residents have contracted
the West Nile virus, but both were treated and are recovering at
home, health officials reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is critical that all New Yorkers, particularly the elderly
and those who live on Staten Island, take precautions to reduce
exposure to mosquitoes,'' city Health Commissioner Neal Cohen told
a City Hall news conference.
</P>
<P>
   He also announced that a dead crow found in the East Tremont
section of the Bronx was infected with West Nile - the first sign
of the virus in that borough. In response, trucks are to spray
pesticides on Tuesday in a two-mile area where the bird was
discovered to try to destroy mosquitos that may be transmitting the
virus.
</P>
<P>
   Test results for the 64-year-old woman and the 63-year-old man
came back positive on Friday. Another Staten Island resident also
was infected with the virus earlier this month, but the 78-year-old
man has made a full recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who lives in Great Kills, became ill with symptoms of
meningitis on Aug. 4. The 63-year-old man, from the Willowbrook
neighborhood, began showing signs of meningitis on July 31, and was
admitted to a hospital on Aug. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Both were infected before the city started spraying last month,
since it takes up to two weeks for symptoms of appear. Staten
Island was last sprayed on Aug. 2, and the entire borough is
scheduled for another round on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The virus is commonly carried by blood-sucking mosquitoes, which
transmit it through bites. Infection may result in encephalitis, an
inflammation of the brain, or meningitis, an inflammation of the
brain's lining and the spinal cord.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen advised residents to wear protective clothing such as long
pants, long-sleeved shirts and socks while outside when mosquitoes
are active. The health commissioner also urged people to eliminate
pools of standing water where mosquitoes are likely to concentrate.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, during the first known appearance of the West Nile
virus in the Western Hemisphere, seven people died and 62 others
were infected in the New York metropolitan area, prompting the city
to undertake an aerial and ground spraying campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The virus apparently survived the winter, in hibernating
insects.
</P>
<P>
   This year, health officials were ready with a huge preventive
effort: They have tested hundreds of birds and tens of thousands of
mosquitoes, while spreading insect repellant where infected birds
or mosquitoes were found.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to commend the New York City Department of Health for
its extensive surveillance activities, which have enabled us to
identify West Nile virus quickly and to take appropriate action as
needed,'' Mayor Rudolph Giuliani told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Also at the news conference were Richard Sheirer, director of
the Mayor's Office of Emergency Management, and Staten Island
President Guy Molinari.
</P>
<P>
   The West Nile virus is named after the West Nile region of
Uganda, where it was was first isolated in 1937. West Nile virus is
most commonly found in Africa, West Asia and the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> Austria's Haider May Meet with Pope  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Austrian right-wing politician Joerg
Haider may be received by Pope John Paul II during a Christmastime
visit to Italy, the Austria Press Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Haider, the governor of the southern province of Carinthia, is
likely to head a delegation presenting a Christmas tree to the
Vatican on December 16, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Haider's recent visit to northern Italy led to demonstrations
protesting his politics, which include echoes of some Nazi
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Since February, the European Union has imposed sanctions against
Austria because Haider's far-right Freedom Party is in the Austrian
government coalition. Haider has since stepped down as party chair.
</P>
<P>
   The Austrian ambassador to the Vatican, Gustav Ortner, said it
was ''entirely possible'' Haider would lead the delegation. An
audience with the pope is considered ''normal'' for such a
delegation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican Christmas tree traditionally comes from a central
European country, and is displayed in St. Peter's Square. The
agreement to receive a tree from Carinthia dates to 1997, before
Haider became governor.
</P>
<P>
   It would be the second meeting for Haider and John Paul II; he
and his family were received by the pope in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Russia Reports 30 Militant Deaths  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Three Chechen rebel commanders were
wounded and 30 militants were killed in a three-day sweep of a
small town in central Chechnya, Russia's Interior Ministry said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel commanders -- Ruslan Gelayev, Arbi Barayev and Akhmed
Zakayev -- were wounded during the federal offensive, Col. Gen.
Vyacheslav Tikhomirov told Russian media. He also said that at
least 30 rebels were killed during the operation in Gekhi, about 10
miles southwest of the Chechen capital of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops also confiscated bombs, guns and ammunition,
according to a federal command spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Russian media reports did not include comment on Russian
casualties, and the number of militant deaths could not be
immediately confirmed. Both sides tend to exaggerate their
successes.
</P>
<P>
   Russian artillery also shelled suspected rebel positions near
the border with Ingushetia late Friday, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported. It said six rebel bodies were later found at the site of
the shelling.
</P>
<P>
   Ingushetia has been the site of several clashes with rebels,
including a battle that broke out when a Russian battalion moved to
intercept a large rebel force spotted outside a village Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rebels' apparent ability to cross the border with
ease and continue fighting, Russia's civilian leader in Chechnya
repeated claims that the militants are no longer a threat.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels blew up a Russian armored personnel carrier Friday with a
remote-controlled mine near Duba-Yurt, 15 miles south of Grozny. An
Associated Press reporter saw 12 bodies lying on the ground after
the blast, but it was not clear if they were dead or wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops moved into Chechnya in September to end the
republic's de facto independence, after a series of terrorist
bombings which Moscow blamed on the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechens fought the Russian military to a standstill in an
earlier 1994-96 war, which ended with Moscow withdrawing from the
republic.

<HEADLINE> Libyan Envoy Denies Hostage Ransom  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Despite signs of Libyan activity,
negotiators on Saturday denied reports that Libya has offered a $25
million ransom for hostages being held by a Muslim rebel group in
the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no truth to that,'' Abdul Rajab Azzarouq, Libya's
former ambassador to the Philippines, said about reports out of
Lebanon that Libya had made the offer.
</P>
<P>
   The Philippine government's chief hostage negotiator, Robert
Aventajado, also denied the reports. But both he and Azzarouq said
Libya has been involved in ''livelihood projects'' -- development
aid for Muslim communities in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Two major Muslim rebel groups have been fighting for years to
carve an independent nation out of the impoverished, heavily Muslim
southern Philippines. The smaller of the groups, the Abu Sayyaf,
seized 21 hostages from a Malaysian diving resort in April and
brought them to Jolo island in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   A German woman and six Malaysians have since been released, and
negotiators including Aventajado and Azzarouq have been working to
free the others.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 5, leading Beirut daily newspaper An-Nahar reported that
Seif al-Islam, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's son, sent an
emissary to Manila to try for a deal to end the hostage standoff.
</P>
<P>
   It said the envoy, Mohamad Ismail, contacted the Lebanese
Embassy in Tokyo and expressed ''full readiness'' to pay $1 million
ransom for the release of Marie Moarbes, a Lebanese-French woman,
as a first priority. The report said Libya would then pay $24
million for the rest of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   The Beirut newspaper also said the freed hostages would be
encouraged to travel to Libya to thank the leadership for its
mediation -- a media show that Tripoli could use to improve its
international standing.
</P>
<P>
   Ismail, who is helping Azzarouq, denied the report.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's rubbish,'' he said, adding that it would be illogical to
give more than what the kidnappers had asked for. The Abu Sayyaf
rebels have demanded $1 million for each of the nine Western
hostages still in their hands -- two Germans, two Finns, Moarbes,
two other French, and two South Africans. The rebels are also
holding three French television journalists, three Malaysians and
two Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the denials, some other reports hinted at Libyan
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   The Philippine Air Transportation Office said it had received an
inquiry from the Libyan embassy on flying a plane from Libya,
although no request for a permit has been made. And in Lebanon,
Prime Minister Salim Hoss' office said in a statement that an envoy
was instructed to ''head to Libya to welcome Marie (Moarbes) once
she arrives at Tripoli airport and to bring her back to Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   Traboulsi was to leave for Libya Saturday but the trip was
canceled at the last minute and was not expected for another two
days, diplomatic sources said. And a chartered flight arranged for
Saturday by the Libyan Embassy in Beirut for the local press to
cover the release was also postponed until at least Monday,
indicating that a release was planned but had been delayed.
</P>
<P>
   Since he became Libya's ruler in 1969, Gadhafi has been
supportive of Muslim, nationalist and leftist rebel groups around
the world. He has a long history of ties with Muslim rebels in the
southern Philippines, including sending development aid and trying
to help negotiate peace agreements between rebels and the
Philippine government.

<HEADLINE> VP Vote To Test Paraguay Democracy  </HEADLINE>
By KEVIN GRAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) -- More than a year after their vice
president was murdered, Paraguayans will pick his successor in a
special, one-office election that threatens to test this South
American country's wobbly democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Election officials spent Saturday tending to final preparations
for the Sunday vote, which will install an elected vice president
alongside highly unpopular President Luis Gonzalez Macchi.
</P>
<P>
   Three candidates are vying to succeed Luis Argana, whose murder
in March 1999 forced former President Raul Cubas to resign and
prompted his chief political ally, a controversial former army
chief, to flee the country. Cubas was suspected of being involved
in Argana's death.
</P>
<P>
   Macchi took over, but his popularity has plummeted as Paraguay's
economy dips into recession.
</P>
<P>
   Paraguayans have never voted for a vice president outside of a
presidential election. Opposition members believe they now have
their best chance in years to break the stranglehold of the
Colorado Party, which has governed Paraguay since 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Polls conducted this week show a virtual tie between the two
leading candidates, Julio Cesar Franco of the opposition Liberal
Party and Felix Argana, the son of the slain vice president and a
member of the Colorado Party. Running a distant third is Ricardo
Buman, an artist and candidate for the little-known Humanist Party.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear what will happen when an unelected, unpopular
president is combined with someone the voters picked. Franco has
alluded to pushing Macchi from office, and some people here predict
that if the Colorado Party loses, their supporters could turn
violent.
</P>
<P>
   It has been more than a decade since a military coup toppled
Alfredo Stroessner's dictatorship, South America's longest-running
in the 20th century at 34 years. But the shaky democracy that
followed in the footsteps of the general's jackboots has hobbled
along from one crisis to another.
</P>
<P>
   The last 18 months has been no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Cubas, the first civilian president to succeed another in
Paraguay, was forced to resign and seek political asylum in Brazil.
His friend, Lino Oviedo, a former army chief, also fled and was
eventually arrested in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Paraguayan authorities want to question Oviedo in the Argana
case. He also is suspected of inspiring a May coup attempt --
Paraguay's third in four years -- by military officers known to be
sympathetic to him.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's vote carries significant undertones of the last year's
upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   Franco, the opposition candidate, has made unapologetic appeals
to Oviedo supporters. If elected, the 48-year-old doctor has
suggested that he would work to have Macchi removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   Argana supporters, meanwhile, have suggested that his election
to office would be a first step toward justice for his father's
death.
</P>
<P>
   Argana has cast himself as a stabilizing force in Macchi's
troubled administration. Macchi's popularity has dipped to less
than 20 percent as Paraguay struggles through a grinding recession.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope to bring some stability to this administration and to
the country,'' Argana told a gathered crowd of cheering supporters
in downtown Asuncion. ''We need to live in peace and work for the
economic betterment of Paraguay.''
</P>
<P>
   To Oviedo sympathizers, Argana had this to say: ''I don't want
the votes of those Colorados that have their hands dirtied with
blood.''

<HEADLINE> Portugal Wolves Kill Sheep After Fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- A pack of wolves apparently searching
for food after fires engulfed their forest killed a flock of 20
sheep Saturday in a northern Portuguese village.
</P>
<P>
   The attack occurred at dawn in the area of Lamego, about 185
miles northeast of Lisbon. The wolves probably had come looking for
food because forests near the village were hit by blazes,
40-year-old shepherd Manuel Porfirio told the national news agency
Lusa.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't remember ever seeing anything like this,'' Porfirio
said.
</P>
<P>
   Forest fires are a regular feature of Portugal's warm and windy
summers. Nearly 56,850 acres of Portuguese land have burned since
January, according to the national forest service.

<HEADLINE> Crowd Rallies for Basque Fighters  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL WOOLLS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BILBAO, Spain (AP) -- Pumping their fists in the air to shouts of
''Long live ETA!'' several thousand people paid tribute Saturday to
four young Basque separatists who blew themselves up by accident,
reportedly while preparing an attack.
</P>
<P>
   A police helicopter hovered in overcast skies as Arnaldo Otegi,
leader of the pro-ETA Basque coalition Euskal Herritarrok, pointed
to poster-size photographs of the four -- two of them just 22 years
old -- and praised them as freedom fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Police had feared incidents between the crowd and opponents of
ETA, the armed Basque separatist group, but the rally went off
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before crowd waving red, white and green Basque flags,
Otegi said it was a pity that men so young had to die in the Basque
conflict. He blamed the Spanish government, saying it had to yield
to what he called Basques' desire for self-rule.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did not choose violence, but there is no other path,''
Otegi said at the rally in the heart of Bilbao, the largest and
richest Basque city.
</P>
<P>
   ETA's armed drive for an independent homeland carved out of
parts of northern Spain and southern France has claimed nearly 800
lives since it began in 1968. In the Basque language, ETA stands
for Basque Freedom and Homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe the four ETA members who died had intended to
launch an attack on Bilbao. On Wednesday, prosecutors filed a suit
against Otegi, accusing him of advocating terrorism after he
described the four who died as ''colleagues and patriots.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Saturday, suspected supporters of the armed group threw
a firebomb at a Civil Guard member's home in the latest in a series
of small-scale attacks in the northern Basque region.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was hurt in the incident in Vitoria, the region's
capital. The house, belonging to a Civil Guard member who was not
identified, was damaged by fire as the guardsman's 17-year-old son
was inside the building.
</P>
<P>
   During the past three days, assailants have thrown Molotov
cocktails at bank offices, burnt some 13 buses and dozens of cars
and attacked automatic teller machines in different Basque cities.
They have been protesting the deaths of the four suspected ETA
members.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, ETA claimed responsibility for 12 attacks between
early May and late July. But the armed group did not mention a
shooting of an army officer Wednesday or two car bombings that
killed a Basque business leader and injured 11 people Tuesday.
Police and politicians have blamed ETA.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Rebels Free Scientists  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW SELSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A rebel group usually scorned for its
tactics won praise Saturday after it freed 26 members of a
scientific expedition that had been held captive in a mountainous
war zone.
</P>
<P>
   Armed rebels, clad in camouflage fatigues and masked by
kerchiefs, released the university team in the grassy highlands of
western Colombia shortly after midnight. The weary former captives
grinned as they were handed over to human rights, church and
justice officials.
</P>
<P>
   The National Liberation Army, which has kidnapped hundreds of
people -- even airline passengers and worshippers at a church --
earned high marks for the quick release.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a gesture of good will, the liberation of this group
of students and scientific commission, and that their captivity was
not prolonged,'' said Maria Villegas, a government human rights
official, who observed the handover.
</P>
<P>
   The captives, including a retired American college professor,
had been missing since Wednesday. Before they were released, they
walked for four hours over rugged terrain, to a site near La Union
village, 125 miles northwest of the capital Bogota. They were
reported in good condition Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel commander Nicolas Rodriguez said Friday that his forces
had detained the scientists in Antioquia province to investigate
their reason for being in the area. He told Colombia's Radionet
Radio on Friday that was satisfied they were there for research,
and he would free them.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrilla group, known by its Spanish initials, ELN,
intercepted the team from Colombia's National University as it
drove along a road, the army said Friday. The captives were
released at the same location, army Col. Juan Pablo Amaya said.
</P>
<P>
   The group included one American, John Douglas Lynch, a native of
Collins, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch recently retired from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln,
where he was a biology professor for nearly 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   He researched amphibians in Colombia for at least two decades
and moved to Bogota when he retired. He is now a curator at the
National Science Institute of Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The group also included six professors, five biologists, 10
students and several assistants, according to the National
University.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rapid release of the hostages, there was little hope
that it would provide a needed good-faith breakthrough to
accelerate peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Peace talks last month in Geneva between the ELN and the
Colombian government ended in stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   The area where the team was working sees frequent clashes
between leftist rebels and paramilitary groups backed by
landowners. Colombia has one of the highest kidnapping rates in the
world.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Blast Death Toll Reaches 11  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Three more people have died from wounds suffered
in a bomb blast that tore through a crowded underground passageway
in Moscow, raising the death toll to 11, hospital officials said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb detonated during the evening rush hour Tuesday in a
passage packed with kiosks selling everything from videos to
clothes. Seven people died at the scene and more than 90 were
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The three latest deaths were a man and a woman who died Saturday
and a woman who suffered burns over 55 percent of her body and died
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Police reported no progress Saturday in finding the bombers,
though official suspicion still centered on militants from Russia's
breakaway republic of Chechnya, where federal forces are fighting
rebels. In a Saturday meeting with top officials, President
Vladimir Putin urged security forces to do more to find the
culprits.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities were searching for three suspects who witnesses saw
fleeing the scene moments before the bomb exploded. In the days
since, police have been frisking men and checking documents on city
streets.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Moscow seized hundreds of grams of TNT from two men,
one of them a Chechen, said Andrei Pashkevich of the Interior
Ministry's organized crime task force, the news agency ITAR-Tass
reported Saturday. Both men were members of organized crime gangs,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Ufa, about 680 miles southeast of Moscow, a railroad car
loaded with more than 17 tons of TNT was confiscated and an
unspecified number of people detained in connection with the
seizure, ITAR-Tass said, citing First Deputy Interior Minister
Vladimir Kozlov.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen rebels also were blamed for apartment building
explosions last September that killed about 300 people. Those
blasts still haunt many Russians, and many feared the explosion
Tuesday might have been the start of a new wave of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel leaders deny they were responsible for any of the attacks,
and police said they also were considering whether gangsters could
have been behind the blast.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives and friends gathered for burials of seven of the dead
on Friday. Another funeral was scheduled for Saturday.

<HEADLINE> McDermott Talks of Tough Childhood  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Dylan McDermott, star of the TV series ''The
Practice,'' has been leading a charmed life lately.
</P>
<P>
   But his childhood was anything but: his parents split before he
was 2, he lost his mother at age 5 and he grew up in a rough town
in Connecticut while his dad tended bar in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was not big. I've been punched out many many times,'' said
McDermott, 38, in the September issue of Movieline magazine. ''I'm
not happy that all this happened to me, but I learned from it.''
</P>
<P>
   From his father, he learned how to tend bar, serving William
Hurt, John Belushi, Ray Sharkey and other famous people.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're a kid and you see for the first time how famous
people are treated like royalty, how people give them things that
they don't give normal human beings, it's like, 'Whoa, this is
something I want. And need! How do you get that?'''

<HEADLINE> Egypt Fears Jerusalem Violence  </HEADLINE>
By SALAH NASRAWI
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- President Hosni Mubarak warned Saturday that
a compromise over Jerusalem would lead to uncontrollable violence
in the Middle East, and said no Arab or Muslim can relinquish
rights to east Jerusalem and its holy sites.
</P>
<P>
   But Egypt would not stop Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat from
reaching a deal over the disputed city, ''if it's compatible with
his Palestinian people's demands,'' Mubarak said in an interview
with the Cairo weekly magazine Rose El-Youssef.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any compromise over Jerusalem will cause the region to explode
in a way that cannot be put under control and terrorism will rise
again,'' Mubarak said in his first public comment since the
collapse of last month's talks between Arafat and Israeli prime
minister Ehud Barak. Mubarak is a key mediator in the Mideast peace
process.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp David, Barak offered the Palestinians limited control
over parts of east Jerusalem, but Arafat held firm on the
Palestinian demand for full sovereignty. The traditionally Arab
area contains the third-holiest shrine in the Islamic world, the Al
Aqsa mosque on the Temple Mount.
</P>
<P>
   ''No single person in the Arab or Islamic world can squander
east Jerusalem or Al Aqsa mosque,'' Mubarak said. ''In this
context, even Arafat himself will not dare to sign a deal to give
up these Muslim sanctities.
</P>
<P>
   ''But we will not dictate to him any decision that he does not
accept and that is not compatible with his Palestinian people's
demands.''
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak's comments came amid reports that Arab leaders have been
cold to the idea of a special Arab summit called by Arafat to seek
support for his position in the peace negotiations. While Arabs in
principle back Arafat's refusal to compromise on east Jerusalem,
they show little enthusiasm to convene a summit that would be seen
as a platform to endorse the Palestinians' moves.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials have said Arafat is disappointed at the
lack of such support, badly needed whether or not he reaches an
agreement with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians have announced plans to declare an independent
state on Sept. 13, with east Jerusalem as its capital. Israel says
an undivided Jerusalem should be its ''eternal'' capital.
</P>
<P>
   However, after meeting with Norwegian officials, Arafat
indicated he might postpone the unilateral declaration of
statehood.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat was scheduled to meet with Israeli senior statesman
Shimon Peres in Oslo on Friday, but arrived well after the Sabbath
had begun. Peres said he had a ''long and warm conversation'' by
telephone with the Palestinian leader Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Peres and Norway's foreign minister indicated Saturday that
progress is being made toward the final peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Time is short. We must all do our best so the last gap does
not become a setback,'' Peres said after talks with Norwegian
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian Foreign Minister Thorbjoern Jagland said he had a
clear impression from his talks with Peres and Arafat that both
sides are interested in an agreement and there was a ''good
possibility'' of a new Mideast peace summit soon.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, on the heels of a trip to 15 Arab and European countries
in 18 days, returned to the Middle East Friday. His envoys continue
to court support for the Palestinian position.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli envoys are also seeking support. Acting foreign minister
Shlomo Ben-Ami met officials in Spain on Saturday, along with
Palestinian officials. He will also visit Italy and the Vatican to
discuss the negotiations.

<HEADLINE> LL Cool J Wrote 'G.O.A.T.' in N.Y.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- LL Cool J took some flak for heading to
Hollywood after achieving fortune and fame, leaving the mean
streets of his childhood behind.
</P>
<P>
   But for his latest album, ''G.O.A.T.,'' he returned to New York
for inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't want to be in Beverly Hills writing songs that deal
with my community,'' said the 31-year-old rapper in the September
issue of The Source. ''But it wasn't about me trying to be a tough
guy; it was about me going back to my roots.
</P>
<P>
   Married to his childhood sweetheart, he and his wife have four
children.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are trying to raise responsible children who will one day
marry people of substance. They may not be perfect people, but
anyone who marries into this family is going to have to be about
something. I'm a winner and I want to make sure my kids are
winners.''
</P>
<P>
   LL Cool J's hits include the song ''Mama said Knock You Out,''
and ''Doin It,'' and he has starred in such films as ''Any Given
Sunday.'' He is shooting his latest feature film, ''Kingdom Come,''
with Whoopi Goldberg and Toni Braxton. His new album is due for
release Sept. 12.

next month, the New York Daily News reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The show is set for Sept. 12, but there's a catch: fans can't
just show up. Tickets, although free, will be required for
admission to the big event.
</P>

   Best Buy, the retail chain sponsoring the event, will handle the
approximately 25,000 tickets to be distributed. Sting will give out
the first ticket at a press conference Sept. 7.

   The stores are planning a series of contests to dole out the

<HEADLINE> Ventura Regrets Religion Comment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Gov. Jesse Ventura says he wishes he
hadn't granted an interview to Playboy magazine in which he
criticized organized religion.
</P>
<P>
   His comments came Friday during a closed meeting with a CIA
leadership group in a Capitol hearing room. Reporters were barred,
but a microphone was left on and WCCO-TV taped the session.
</P>
<P>
   ''Personally, I'll survive it, and I knew I would. But it was
very difficult for my family in light of what happened,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the November Playboy issue, Ventura ignited a firestorm by
saying organized religion was ''a sham and a crutch for weak-minded
people who need strength in numbers. It tells people to go out and
stick their noses in other people's business.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura also said he was thinking about running for a second
term. But when he leaves office, he said he plans to change his
appearance and go into seclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's printed schedule described the group as a
''Central Intelligence Agency leadership group,'' but did not
elaborate. Later, Ventura spokesman John Wodele said he would not
describe the group in any more detail ''with respect for the CIA
and their need to be anonymous.''

	   ROSEBOOM, N.Y. (AP) - A Schenectady man died when a small plane
he was piloting home after purchasing it in Illinois crashed in a
wooded area, deputies said.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Wnuk, 58, bought the 1974 single-engine Grumman aircraft
on Thursday in Peru, Ill., and left Friday morning to fly it back
to Schenectady, the Otsego Sheriff's department said. It crashed at
8:20 p.m. Friday in this town just south of Cherry Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Investigator Richard Devlin said it is believed only Wnuk was
aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The weather and damaged trees forced investigators to call off
the search late Friday, but Wnuk's body was found in the wreckage
Saturday. An autopsy is planned.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration and the National
Transportation Safety Board are investigating.

<HEADLINE> UN Selects Kosovo Election Date  </HEADLINE>
By FISNIK ABRASHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- U.N. officials on Saturday set Oct.
28 as the date for Kosovo's first-ever internationally supervised
elections, an event promoted as a step toward a democratic society.
</P>
<P>
   The top U.N. administrator for Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner,
announced the date for the local elections more than a month after
the deadline for registration. The elections will choose members
for 30 municipal assemblies in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs in the province, however, overwhelmingly refused to
register, even though the United Nations had extended the deadline
to encourage minorities to sign up. The United Nations wanted
substantial participation from all ethnic groups to give legitimacy
to the balloting.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1 million people registered, but the province's main
ethnic minorities -- in particular, Serbs and Gypsies, or Roma --
were missing from the voter lists.
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner, speaking to reporters after meeting with local
residents of the town of Vucitrn, 18 miles north of Pristina,
described the Serb decision not to participate as being
unfortunate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very sorry for them and I think it was a mistake,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A key Kosovo Serb leader, Oliver Ivanovic, however, expressed
disinterest in the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't care,'' Ivanovic said when asked about the election
plans. ''The Serbs won't vote. They won't participate. Let Kouchner
have his elections if it makes him happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Tanjug news agency, a mouthpiece for Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic's government, criticized the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rather than effort to create democratic institutions in
Kosovo, Kouchner has hereby proven himself to be an accomplice of
ethnic Albanian separatists and terrorists who have ethnically
cleansed the province of Serbs since his arrival there,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of Serbs have fled Kosovo in the year since
NATO-led peacekeepers took charge after a 78-day air war to force
Milosevic to end his repression of ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials hope the ballot would move the province toward
greater normalcy.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen political parties have been certified to take part in
elections, as have two coalitions, three citizens initiatives and
15 independent candidates.

<HEADLINE> Possible 100-point ball back on the auction block  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - The ball that Wilt Chamberlain might have
used to score his NBA-record 100 points is back on the auction
block.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the ball's sale was called off because of questions
about its authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   The disputed ball will be back at Leland's auction house in New
York on Sept. 21 and 22 with a notarized affidavit from nine
spectators at the historic game between Chamberlain's Philadelphia
Warriors and the New York Knicks at Hershey, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Ryman of Annville has said that as a 14-year-old he stole
the ball at Hershey Arena on March 2, 1962, moments after the game.
The signed affidavit has nine signatures backing up his story.
</P>
<P>
   Others at the game, however, including 76ers statistician Harvey
Pollack, have said the 100-point ball was taken out of the game by
referee Willie Smith and later given to Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   They say the 100-point ball was autographed by Warriors players
and officials, put on display in Philadelphia, then lost or given
away when the Warriors moved to California.
</P>
<P>
   Pollack has insisted that the ball Ryman took had been in use
for only the final 46 seconds of the game, after Chamberlain
reached 100.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the very least,'' said Leland's Mike Heffner, who indicated
that the bidding next month would start at $25,000, ''it was the
last ball used in that game.''
</P>
<P>
   Leland's sold the ball April 28 for $551,844 - a record for a
basketball and the third highest figure of any sports memorabilia
item sold at auction. The buyer in that canceled sale never was
identified.

<HEADLINE> Storm dumps 10 inches of rain on northern New Jersey  </HEADLINE>
By HANAH CHO
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than 12 inches of rain barraged parts of northern New
Jersey on Saturday, flooding lakes and rivers and causing several
bridges to collapse, sending cars into the water but injuring no
one. Some residents were evacuated and others were told to stay in
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy rains also forced the postponement of a wedding
ceremony that was to have taken place at a minor league baseball
park.
</P>
<P>
   The storm hovered over parts of Morris, Sussex, Hunterdon,
Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Passaic and Union counties through the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service issued a flash flood watch until
Saturday night for counties throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   A flash flood warning was issued for Somerset and Hunterdon
counties, where officials were concerned that people might get
caught in rising flood waters on roads.
</P>
<P>
   In Sparta, where more than 12 inches of rain fell, a state of
emergency was declared. Emergency messages were broadcast on a
local radio station urging residents to stay in their homes until
further notice.
</P>
<P>
   The flooding caused bridges to collapse in Jefferson Township
and Ogdensburg, officials said. No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Police received reports of submerged cars and motorists stranded
on top of their vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   At least 100 emergency personnel were working in Jefferson
Township, a police dispatcher said.
</P>
<P>
   Other roads and bridges in the area were underwater, police
said, and emergency workers were putting up sandbags in
Branchville.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents of Sparta, Ogdensburg, Lake Hopatcong and
Hardyston Township were evacuated, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The flooding forced the closure of several roads in Morris and
Sussex counties, including Route 15 in Sparta and Jefferson
Township and roads in Roxbury and Wharton.
</P>
<P>
   Power wires were brought down in Sparta, where the storm was
centered for most of the day.
</P>
<P>
   GPU said about 10,000 customers lost power in Flemington, Newton
and Dover. Spokeswoman Sue Hohenadel said crews were trying to
respond, but were having trouble reaching the customers because
many roads were washed out.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our crews are waiting to get to people, but we can't,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   About 770 PSE&AMP;G customers in Bridgewater, Willingboro and
Florence lost power Saturday afternoon. Their power was expected to
be restored by 6 p.m. said spokesman Don Tretola. Most of the
outages were caused by lightning strikes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The flooding made for a very quiet Saturday at Jefferson Bagels
on Route 15 in Jefferson Township.
</P>
<P>
   ''We saw absolutely no traffic for the last three or four
hours,'' said Muhammad Farooq. ''We had heavy rain from 9:30 a.m.
to 1:30 p.m. We have a lot of bagels left over.''
</P>
<P>
   The storm forced the Somerset Patriots to postpone a wedding
that was to have taken place at Commerce Bank Ballpark on Saturday
evening. Glenn and Jane Jannarone, of Neshanic, are scheduled to
renew their vows at a game between the Somerset Patriots and the
Aberdeen Arsenal on Sept. 2., the Patriots said.
</P>
<P>
   The weather service said excessive runoff from the storm would
cause flash flooding of small creeks and streams, country roads and
farmland along the banks of creeks and streams. Forecasters also
said heavy rains could trigger rock and mudslides in steep terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered heavy rainfall since Friday morning had left the
ground saturated in various places. More showers and thunderstorms
were expected Saturday evening.

<HEADLINE> NJ town begins spraying for mosquitos  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARTERET, N.J. (AP) - Several dead crows infected with the West
Nile virus have prompted health officials to spray for mosquitos in
the densely populated borough of Carteret.
</P>
<P>
   The street-by-street spraying was scheduled to begin Monday
evening and more spraying was expected Thursday, Middlesex County
health officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The spraying was deemed necessary after 15 dead crows tested
positive for West Nile virus infection. Officials said spray trucks
will drive through the 4.4-square-mile town of 19,000 residents
with a pesticide, called Scourge, which kills mosquitoes on
contact.
</P>
<P>
   Middlesex County officials had said they were reluctant to order
the pesticide to be sprayed. But the increase in the number of dead
crows found here prompted the action. Only four other dead crows
have turned up in all of Middlesex County - three in Woodbridge and
one in Sayreville.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials also said they decided to spray in Carteret
because the borough has a dense population and is close to Staten
Island, N.Y., where three people recently contracted the virus and
are recovering.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are only precautions. We are not in a state of
emergency,'' Carteret Mayor James Failace told The Star-Ledger of
Newark for Saturday's editions. ''Spraying should give citizens a
reason to relax.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Cherepski, who coaches a Pop Warner football team in the
borough, said he planned to cancel Monday night's practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it needs to be done, then I guess it needs to be done,''
Cherepski told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials said people should shut their doors, close
their windows and turn off their air conditioning to avoid contact
with the chemical for about 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, 89 dead, infected crows have been found in seven
New Jersey counties. Bergen County leads the state with 37 dead
crows, followed by Middlesex, Passaic, Hudson, Union, Essex and
Monmouth.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 73 crows in 16 counties tested positive for the
virus.
</P>
<P>
   Carteret is just across the Arthur Kill from Staten Island,
where 27 dead crows infected with the West Nile virus have been
found. At some points, the distance between Carteret and Staten
Island measures less than a mile.
</P>
<P>
   Test results on two suspected West Nile cases in New Jersey came
back negative this week. Officials said they were awaiting results
on seven other possible New Jersey cases.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton says she's been hard at work -- not eating bonbons  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton said Saturday she
spent her White House years working hard on issues, and she
dismissed critics who insinuate she ''sat around eating bonbons.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Clinton defended her
work on issues ranging from health insurance to education and
adoption.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady has been under attack in New York from her
Republican opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, for lacking a public record.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just ask her one thing that she's done for New York,'' has
become a familiar Lazio refrain in the highly competitive Senate
race.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said she has a record to run on.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was deeply involved within the White House,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want people to know that, because if someone is going to
claim I sat around eating bonbons for the last five or six years, I
think it's only fair that the truth come out,'' the first lady told
the AP.
</P>
<P>
   The remark was reminiscent of Clinton's comment during the 1992
presidential campaign when she defended her work as a lawyer by
saying, ''I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and
had teas.'' She later apologized for the remark.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady said much of her Monday night speech to the
Democratic National Convention will focus on children and that she
plans to use the prime-time slot to take on the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''We heard a lot about children in the other party's convention,
but their record doesn't match their rhetoric,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With a hearty laugh, the first lady said that in her speech she
''might make passing reference'' to the GOP convention. ''I'm just
going to describe what I heard and saw and contrast it to what the
record is,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On her record, Clinton said the public perception that she
largely withdrew after the defeat in 1994 of the White House health
care reforms, which she spearheaded, was not accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I rolled up my sleeves and got back to work ... I wrote a
book,'' she said, adding that she was ''not interested in
headlines.''
</P>
<P>
   ''None of it was a secret, but it may not have been on the front
pages and I want people to know what I did because I think it's
important that they understand that I spent my time in the White
House working, as I have for 30 years, to try to give every child a
chance,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady denied reports of tension between her, the
president and Vice President Al Gore over the Clintons'
high-profile presence in Los Angeles this weekend and on the
opening night of the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are here to do everything we can to highlight the
Clinton-Gore administration and to promote the Gore-Lieberman
administration,'' she said, just hours before she and the president
were to attend a fund-raising gala expected to raise $1 million for
the first lady's campaign. The gala features a star-studded roster
of entertainers including Cher, Diana Ross and Michael Bolton.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're doing everything we can to help and we're obviously
working closely with Al and Tipper (Gore) to try to be as effective
as we can,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She backed Gore's successful pressuring of Rep. Loretta Sanchez
to move a Hispanic fund-raising event out of the Playboy mansion.
''It's his convention,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And she rejected criticism from Lazio for accepting a $2,000
contribution from Christie Hefner, the daughter of Playboy founder
Hugh Hefner and now a top executive with Playboy Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   ''Christie Hefner is someone who contributes to a lot of
different people and I don't find that inappropriate or
surprising,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the difference between her high-profile role at the
Democratic convention and Lazio's one-day visit to the GOP
gathering with no speaking role, the first lady broke into a wide
smile.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know, I'm proud to be a Democrat and I'm a Democrat
whether I'm in New York or Washington or Los Angeles ... He seems
to be unwilling to be identified with the Republicans in New York
and certainly didn't want to be in Philadelphia,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She turned aside questions about Gov. George W. Bush's statement
Friday that her husband had ''embarrassed the nation'' with the
Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president has expressed his own feelings about that ...
All the rest of us are focused on the future,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After the convention, the Clintons and their daughter, Chelsea,
plan to spend a long weekend at a private home near Lake Placid,
N.Y., in the Adirondack Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't wait,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Germans Call For Neo-Nazi Party Ban  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- German politicians are stepping up calls for a ban
on a right-wing political party, one of the steps being considered
in Germany's attempts to stem an outbreak of neo-Nazi violence.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence agencies have enough information on the
extreme-right National Democratic Party of Germany, or NPD, for the
country's highest court to enact a ban, Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder's intelligence coordinator, Ernst Uhrlau, said.
</P>
<P>
   ''A constitutional state must consistently use its instruments
to signal that right-wing extremism will not be accepted in
Germany,'' Uhrlau said in an interview to be published Sunday in
Welt am Sonntag newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Chief government spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye said the government
would support a ban if it is recommended by a group of federal and
state officials considering proposals concerning the NPD. The group
met in Berlin on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Heye also emphasized that neo-Nazism was not only a problem in
eastern Germany, where unemployment and lack of exposure to
foreigners has fueled xenophobic sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have an all-German problem,'' Heye said in an interview to
be published Sunday in the Frankfurt Allgemeine newspaper. ''No
matter what the statistics on offenses show: the most spirited
arsonists all come from the west.''
</P>
<P>
   In Munich, about 3,000 people demonstrated Saturday against
right-wing violence at an event including city leaders and
entertainers. The justice minister of Bavaria added his voice to
those of other conservative leaders for an NPD ban.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are of the opinion that the NPD in large part is
responsible for this right-wing violence,'' Manfred Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the interior minister of Hesse state, Volker Bouffier,
warned in an interview Saturday with the Wetzlarer Neuen Zeitung
that attempts to curtail right-wing parties could be ''politically
counterproductive'' and only create martyrs.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in the western city of Bruchsal, members of
the NPD's leadership denied their party was connected to violence.
At the same time, about 150 people demonstrated there against the
party.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Saturday that 38 people were taken into custody
following the first game of the German soccer league's season,
including 16 people who were singing banned right-wing songs and
greeting one another with ''Heil Hitler'' salutes. The arrests came
at the Friday night game between Borussia Dortmund and Hansa
Rostock.
</P>
<P>
   Police also said Saturday that they had arrested the main
suspect in the deadly beating of a homeless man. Authorities say
Gunnar Doege, 24, and three other right-wing teens believe homeless
people don't belong in society.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper reported that a concert has been planned for this
fall in Berlin to combat right-wing violence. The event would be a
part of the national ''Show Your Face'' initiative against
neo-Nazis, which has been proposed by leaders from government and
the Central Council.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Diplomat Ben-Elisar Dies  </HEADLINE>
By JACK KATZENELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Eliahu Ben-Elisar, a veteran right-wing
politician who helped negotiate Israel's peace treaty with Egypt,
and later served as ambassador to Egypt, the United States and
France, died Saturday in Paris. He was 68.
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Elisar's death of cardiac arrest came just after he and some
other right-wing diplomats had been recalled by Prime Minister Ehud
Barak. Ben-Elisar died as he was preparing to return home, the
Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ben-Elisar was a political opponent of Barak, the prime
minister praised the man who was Israel's first ambassador to
Egypt, saying Ben-Elisar ''poured content into the new peace
between the two states.''
</P>
<P>
   As a major figure in the office of then-Prime Minister Menahem
Begin, Ben-Elisar was closely involved in the negotiations with the
late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, the first Arab leader to make
peace with Israel, in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Radom, Poland, Ben-Elisar arrived in British Mandatory
Palestine in 1942 at the age of 10. His family perished in the Nazi
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   For a number of years he served in the Mossad, the Israeli spy
agency, but he never spoke about his experiences there.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to Israel, he joined the right-wing opposition Likud
party and represented it abroad as a delegate to the Zionist
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Begin appointed Ben-Elisar director general of the prime
minister's office when Likud came to power for the first time in
1977. He was later elected to parliament, where he served two terms
as chairman of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu, appointed Ben-Elisar
ambassador to the United States in 1996 and to France in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   When Barak and the Labor party took power in 1999, Ben-Elisar
found himself representing peace policies with which he did not
agree.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a bitter opponent of the Oslo agreement (with the
Palestinians),'' said his Likud party colleague Uzi Landau, who now
heads the Foreign Affairs and Defense committee.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Barak's foreign minister, David Levy, did not replace
Ben-Elisar. Levy was a defector from the Likud and Ben-Elisar had
supported him when he was still a contender for the Likud
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, however, Levy quit Barak's coalition because he
disagreed with the concessions that Barak offered to the
Palestinians at the Camp David summit. Within days, Barak informed
several right-wing diplomats that they were being recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Elisar leaves a wife, Nitza, and two adult children.

<HEADLINE> Lottery Winner Wants Money Back  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COVINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- A man who has faced an array of legal
problems since winning $34.1 million in the Powerball lottery now
is trying to get back $500,000 he gave away while he was drunk.
</P>
<P>
   Mack Metcalf, 42, filed suit Friday against Deborah Hodge,
accusing her of threatening him and harassing him for money when he
was ''incompetent to make a valid gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenton County Circuit Court Judge Douglas Stephens signed a
temporary order freezing Hodge's assets.
</P>
<P>
   Hodge could not be reached for comment Saturday. No telephone
number is listed for her in Covington, across the Ohio River from
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf has spent plenty of time in court since collecting his
jackpot on July 26.
</P>
<P>
   He was found to be $31,000 behind in child support payments and
was ordered to place $880,000 in escrow to support his daughter, he
was cited for public drunkenness, and he missed a court date for a
previous drunken driving charge.
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf is splitting the winnings 60-40 with his wife, who lives
in Dayton, Ky. Powerball tickets are sold in 20 states and the
District of Columbia.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Alberto Seen Weakening  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Alberto, the first hurricane of the 2000 Atlantic
season, strengthened early Saturday but forecasters predicted it
would gradually weaken as it moved over cooler waters.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane was not expected to pose any threat to land as it
continued to move northeast over open ocean. Satellite estimates
indicated Alberto had maximum sustained winds peaking at 125 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could get caught up by the westerly winds and just become a
big storm with high winds in the western Atlantic,'' said Stacy
Stewart, a hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center in
Miami. ''If it stays over warmer water it will still remain a
significant hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   Alberto's center was expected to pass north of the Azores
islands, west of Portugal, in coming days as a powerful storm
system. At 5 p.m. EDT, Alberto was located about 1,345 miles west
of the Azores.
</P>
<P>
   The center revised its outlook for the season Thursday by
predicting above-average activity: at least 11 named storms, seven
hurricanes and three major hurricanes.

<HEADLINE> Cheney Gets $20M Retirement Deal  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- GOP vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney
was granted a $20 million retirement package from the oil services
company he is retiring from, a person familiar with the company's
plan said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The package exceeds what Cheney would have gotten under the
terms of his employment agreement with Dallas-based Halliburton,
Co., where he was chairman and chief executive for five years.
</P>
<P>
   The company's board approved the package July 26, the day George
W. Bush announced that the former defense secretary would be his
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney has said that in leaving Halliburton, which paid him $1.3
million last year, he will ''take a bath'' financially.
</P>
<P>
   The 59-year-old Cheney stood to reap millions more if he had
stayed until his contract expired in 2003. But the package is
generous nevertheless, said one observer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since he quit and they gave him more than he could have
expected, he's certainly gotten a good break,'' said Herbert
Alexander, professor emeritus of political science University of
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton board members could not be reached for comment.
Cheney spokesman Dirk Vande Beek said the details were being worked
out. Cheney will retire from the company Aug. 16, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore's campaign, which has portrayed Bush and
Cheney as beholden to the interests of the oil industry, jumped on
the news.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the major issues in this campaign, particularly in the
Midwest, is that Republicans are offering the Big Oil ticket,''
said Chris Lehane, Gore's spokesman. ''They'll turn the Oval Office
into the Oil Office.''
</P>
<P>
   Countered Karen Hughes, Bush's communications director: ''The
American public should be pleased that they have a vice
presidential nominee who has been successful.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Cheney's retirement package is ''very much in keeping''
with those given to other Halliburton executives. ''He has assured
the governor and the American people that he will comply fully with
all laws and regulations and that, when elected, he will act to
ensure there is no conflict of interest,'' Hughes said later.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Cheney both have ties to the oil business. Bush ran oil
drilling ventures in Texas. Halliburton provides technology and
equipment to oil companies and major oil producing nations.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney has said he plans to sell off his Halliburton stock and
divest his other financial holdings, but not until the Republican
ticket wins in November.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why not? I'm not on the government roll yet, I have no control
over policy,'' Cheney said in an interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander called that unusual, saying most candidates place
their assets in a blind trust to avoid the appearance of a conflict
of interest.
</P>
<P>
   The board's vote let Cheney avoid a potentially costly aspect of
his employment contract, which said he would forfeit some of his
compensation if he retired before age 62 without the board's
permission, according to The New York Times, which first reported
the deal Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney spent 25 years in public service as a House member and in
White House jobs in the Nixon, Ford and Bush administrations.
Joining Halliburton in 1995, he became a wealthy man, earning an
average of $2 million a year and reaping lucrative stock options.
In May he sold 100,000 shares of stock for $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Company financial reports show Cheney was entitled to at least
$2.1 million in deferred compensation when he left, plus millions
of dollars worth of the company's stock. Another perk was the
deferred compensation earned an interest rate of about 10 percent,
higher than the usual 7 percent most companies pay.
</P>
<P>
   The company could sweeten the total package with the board's
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney owns or has options on more than 1 million shares of
Halliburton stock. His portfolio's value depends on the reduced
price he pays for his options and the stock price when he sells it.
Halliburton stock closed Friday at $51 a shares; a million shares
were worth $51 million.
</P>
<P>
   By letting Cheney take early retirement, the directors allowed
him to keep $10 million worth of stock and options he would have
forfeited had he resigned, the company's public filings show. It
was not clear whether the $10 million was part of the retirement
package or in addition to it, the Times said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's package is not unique for the oil industry, which often
rewards retiring executives handsomely, especially when companies
do well and executives have spent a long career there.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, however, Alexander said the package is lucrative
considering Cheney spent only five years at Halliburton.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton plans to make an announcement next week, the source
said.

<HEADLINE> Dalai Lama Holds Out Hope For Tibet  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS MCDONALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   QAZA, India (AP) -- From an ancient monastery in the Himalayas,
the Dalai Lama sent out a message of hope Saturday for Tibetans who
live under what he called aparthied-like conditions in China.
</P>
<P>
   The Bhuddist spiritual leader was joined in prayers by thousands
of Tibetans, Indians and foreigners who have gathered for a 15-day
ceremony in Key Gompa, a 1,000-year-old monastery near India's
border with Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you look at Tibet locally, the situation is hopeless,'' the
Dalai Lama told the congregation seated in a prayer hall festooned
with giant paintings of Tibetan deities. ''But globally, things are
changing. Internationally we are gaining support everywhere and the
spirit of the Tibetans is very strong.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama was leading the 15-day Kalachakra initiation
ceremony at the monastery. He spoke for an hour and 45 minutes to
an assembly of Indian, Tibetan and western journalists.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during Saturday's meeting, he compared China to
apartheid South Africa, saying that the Chinese believed themselves
to be superior to the Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he hoped to visit Taiwan later this year, a move
sure to draw an angry response from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm hoping perhaps within the year, I may have the opportunity
to visit,'' the Dalai Lama said. He said Taiwan combined economic
progress with functioning democracy and Buddhist spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama, who was awarded the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize, fled
Tibet in 1959 with thousands of supporters after a failed revolt
against Chinese rule of the mountain region.
</P>
<P>
   He will stay at the remote monaster in Spiti, a valley high in
the Himalayas, until Thursday, when he returns to his base in
Dharmsala, in northern India. Asked if the location made him
homesick, the Dalai Lama joked that the high altitude had given him
dry lips and headaches. Key Gompa is 13,579 feet above sea level.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Mexico Official Under Arrest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A judge has ordered Mexico's former tourism
secretary placed under house arrest as police continue to search
for him, news reports said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Eugenio Ramirez on Friday ordered 30 days of house arrest
for former Tourism Secretary Oscar Espinosa Villarreal in the first
corruption case against a Cabinet member in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors of Mexico City's opposition-led government accuse
Espinosa of embezzling $45 million while he was Mexico City mayor
from 1994 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Espinosa resigned Tuesday, hours after prosecutors said they
could not prosecute him until he stepped down from his post, which
would remove the immunity from prosecution he enjoys as a Cabinet
member under President Ernesto Zedillo. He was named to the post
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of pressing charges, prosecutors asked Espinosa to
testify Thursday before the city's magistrate. When Espinosa failed
to show, the city's district attorney's office ordered police to
locate him.
</P>
<P>
   His defense lawyer Alonso Aguilar Zinser told the national
network Televisa on Friday that Espinosa will tend to the matter
when it reaches the courts. He did not give Espinosa's location.
</P>
<P>
   Espinosa, a member of Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary
Party, which lost the mayor's office to the center-left Democratic
Revolution Party in 1997, has said the accusations are politically
motivated.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Espinosa's party lost the presidency for the first time
in 71 years.

<HEADLINE> Indian Troops Kill Four Rebels  </HEADLINE>
By WASBIR HUSSAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAUHATI, India (AP) -- Federal troops killed four separatist
guerrillas in India's northeastern Assam state on Saturday, while
another rebel group blew up a power station, the military said.
</P>
<P>
   Indian authorities said they had sent at least 50,000 troops
into the region to reinforce security amid fears of further rebel
attacks ahead of the country's Aug. 15 Independence Day.
</P>
<P>
   A senior army officer said soldiers shot the four militants
during a pre-dawn raid at a hotel in eastern Assam's Tinsukia
district, 330 miles from Gauhati, Assam's capital.
</P>
<P>
   The dead rebels belonged to the outlawed United Liberation Front
of Asom (ULFA), who are fighting for independence from India, the
officer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The slain ULFA militants, including an explosives expert of
the outfit, were planning to stage violent acts in the area before
Independence Day on August 15,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The separatist rebels usually step up violence ahead of India's
Independence Day.
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, tribal Bodo militants triggered a powerful
explosion near Madhupur in Kamrup district, 36 miles west of
Gauhati, damaging a transformer and power line.
</P>
<P>
   Police attributed the blast to the National Democratic Front of
Bodoland (NDFB) and say they have arrested at least 40 people for
the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Militants have warned that they would take ''stern action''
against those who take part in the Independence Day celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month in Assam, tribal Bodo and ULFA militants blew
up two trains, including a passenger train, killing 12 soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Complete Western Tour  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRESCOTT, Ariz. (AP) -- George W. Bush pledged Saturday to
''restore the military power of the United States'' as he and
former rival John McCain completed a three-day Western campaign
tour.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and Sen. McCain, R-Ariz., sounded military themes,
here in McCain's home state and earlier at a rally near a naval
complex in Everett, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   They were Bush's final campaign events before he steps out of
the spotlight for the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''This administration for seven years has squandered the
political capital of a previous administration,'' Bush told a
courthouse rally here. ''We will restore the military power of the
United States. We do so to keep the peace.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, defeated by Bush in the Republican presidential
primaries, compared him to a conservative Arizona hero, the late
Sen. Barry Goldwater. McCain noted Goldwater had begun his 1964
presidential campaign from the same Yavapai County Courthouse were
he and Bush were speaking.
</P>
<P>
   ''Barry Goldwater didn't win. But his spirit ... of
conservatism, of an inclusive party ... are here today'' in Bush,
McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, with the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln as a
backdrop, Bush issued an appeal in Washington to those in uniform:
''Stay in the military, there's a new commander in chief coming.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain told that audience that patriotism and respect for the
military were gaining in the country.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a former Navy pilot and Vietnam War prisoner of war,
said Bush would help lift ''the pay, the morale and the benefits''
of those in the military.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have complete confidence'' in Bush, McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on a dock in the Port of Everett across from a naval
terminal, Bush mixed his pledges of increased attention to the
military with implied criticism of President Clinton's role as
commander in chief.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would work with Congress for a military that was
better paid, better equipped and better trained.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to have a military of high spirits,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   He reiterated his support for a national defense against
ballistic missiles, a cut in nuclear arsenals and vowed he would
''not defend outdated treaties,'' a reference to the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is seeking to negotiate changes in
that treaty to allow a national missile defense. Conservative
Republicans have suggested the pact is null.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also promised to reverse a recent political trend and carry
the Pacific Northwest. Oregon and Washington have not voted
Republican in a presidential election since Ronald Reagan's 1984
landslide re-election victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we have a good chance. We have the right issues,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, Bush has been implying that his rival, Vice
President Al Gore should do more to repudiate President Clinton's
ethical lapses.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's affair with a White House intern and the impeachment
process were ''an embarrassment. I think most Americans think
that,'' Bush said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton revived the subject himself on Thursday when he told a
group of evangelical ministers he was trying to rebuild his life
after the ''terrible mistake'' that led to his impeachment in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor was spending Saturday night and part of
Sunday with McCain on McCain's ranch at Sedona, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hear it's a spectacular place,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not only that, but he's going to have spectacular food,''
chimed in McCain, noting that he planned to do the cooking himself
-- chicken and ribs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was then to head for his 1,500-acre ranch near Waco, Texas,
and planned to stay there until after the end of the Democratic
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''I expect some good rest,'' he said. He said he doubted he'd
watch the convention on television: ''I don't have cable. I'm
sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   In their joint appearances, Bush praised McCain as ''a patriot,
a hero and a friend of mine.'' And McCain said Bush would ''restore
dignity, honor and respect to the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   However, despite their show of affection and reconciliation in
public, the two former rivals spent little time together during
their train and plane trips, aides said.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers for newspaper move to withhold reporter's notes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - Lawyers for The Philadelphia Inquirer want
to bar a New Jersey rabbi from obtaining the notes of a reporter
who covered the investigation into the 1994 killing of his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Inquirer lawyer Warren W. Faulk, in court documents filed
Friday, said any information gathered by reporter Nancy Phillips is
protected by New Jersey's so-called shield law, which was enacted
to prevent news reporters from being forced to testify or turn over
their notes.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said Phillips has signed a statement invoking the
law and is refusing to disclose any information, including her
notes.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk also wants to block lawyers for Cherry Hill, N.J., Rabbi
Fred J. Neulander from calling Phillips to appear at a Sept. 1
hearing before state Superior Court Judge Linda G. Rosenzweig.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander's lawyers contend that Phillips, who was present when
a private investigator told Camden County Prosecutor Lee A. Solomon
that the rabbi hired him to kill his wife, ''crossed the line from
reporter to witness'' in her dealings with the investigator,
Leonard Jenoff, and became an agent for the Camden County
Prosecutor's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff confessed his role in the killing to Solomon and county
homicide Detective Martin Devlin at an Audubon diner on April 28,
with Phillips present.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander's lawyers, Dennis Wixted and Jeffrey Zucker, in court
documents have cited a report in which Devlin said Solomon had told
him on April 20 that Phillips ''had information concerning the
possible participation'' of Jenoff in the killing. That was eight
days before Jenoff confessed to Solomon and Devlin.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this allegation by Solomon is true, Phillips was already
acting on behalf of the state in delivering Jenoff on a silver
platter,'' the lawyers said, adding that she was acting as an
informant rather than a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   But Faulk disagreed. He said that report ''does not indicate in
any way'' that Phillips gave specific information to Solomon, and
suggested that Solomon may have inferred that Phillips had
information about Jenoff's possible involvement because of the
questions she was asking.
</P>
<P>
   ''The subpoena issued to Ms. Phillips is nothing more than a
'fishing expedition' - an unsanctioned and unlicensed attempt to
rummage through six years of a reporter's confidential and
privileged materials to see if they contain any information which
might be helpful to the defense,'' Faulk wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk said the shield law was designed to give extensive
protection to reporters and that Neulander's lawyers have ''failed
to satisfy the stringent statutory prerequisites for overcoming''
the privileges established by that law.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander, charged with capital murder, is being held at the
Camden County jail. He is accused of arranging to have his wife,
Carol, killed at their Cherry Hill home. Prosecutors say he wanted
his wife dead so he could pursue a relationship with Philadelphia
radio personality Elaine Soncini.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander, 58, has maintained his innocence. No date has been
set for his trial.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff, 54, of Collingswood, has said the rabbi promised to pay
him $30,000 to kill his wife. Jenoff and his alleged accomplice,
Paul Daniels, 27, of Pennsauken, have both pleaded guilty to
aggravated manslaughter and have agreed to testify against
Neulander.

joined in prayers by thousands of Tibetans, Indians and foreigners who have
gathered for a 15-day ceremony in Key Gompa, a 1,000-year-old monastery near
India's border with Tibet. The Dalai Lama was leading the 15-day Kalachakra

   BERLIN (AP) -- German politicians are stepping up calls for a ban on a
right-wing political party, one of the steps being considered in Germany's
attempts to stem an outbreak of neo-Nazi violence. Intelligence agencies have
enough information on the extreme-right National Democratic Party of Germany, or
NPD, for the country's highest court to enact a ban, Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder's intelligence coordinator, Ernst Uhrlau, said. Chief government
spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye said the government would support a ban if it is
recommended by a group of federal and state officials considering proposals
concerning the NPD.

WCCO-TV taped the session. In the November Playboy issue, Ventura ignited a

people who need strength in numbers. It tells people to go out and stick their

<HEADLINE> USDA Testing Pork Safety Program  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The days of the chewy pork chop may soon be
over.
</P>
<P>
   Americans for years have been overcooking pork out of fear of
trichinosis -- unaware that improved production practices virtually
have eliminated the disease-causing worm from U.S. hogs.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department is now testing a program for
certifying pigs as trichinae-free that could be a model for
controlling other parasites and food-borne pathogens such as E.
coli and salmonella.
</P>
<P>
   Such programs could pressure farmers to improve their production
methods to prevent animals from becoming contaminated, rather than
just relying on processors and consumers to kill pathogens.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is clear that the best place to stop contamination and to
control the causes of foodborne illness is before the microorganism
or the parasite ever leaves the farm,'' said Carol Tucker Foreman,
director of the Consumer Federation of America's Food Policy
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Research is under way in Texas on a feed additive that has shown
promise in eliminating E. coli O157:H7, a potentially deadly
bacterium, from beef cattle.
</P>
<P>
   Improved sanitation practices on egg farms already is helping to
reduce rates of salmonella contamination in egg-laying hens.
</P>
<P>
   As for trichinae, millions of schoolchildren have been warned
over the years not to eat undercooked pork, lest they get the
parasite in their muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Hogs pick up the worm from consuming raw garbage or infected
animal carcasses, and hogs, being hogs, will eat just about
anything. Laws enacted in the 1950s required that waste be cooked
before it was fed to pigs.
</P>
<P>
   About 2 percent of the nation's swine were infected with the
parasite in 1900. By 1995, that had been reduced to 0.013 percent.
The rate is expected to be even lower, if the worm shows up at all,
when an updated survey is completed this year.
</P>
<P>
   Human infections are rare. Fewer than 50 cases of human
trichinosis are reported annually to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, compared with 500 cases a year in the
1940s, and many of the recent ones are attributed to consumption of
wild game, not pigs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fear of trichinosis is a perceived threat rather than a
real one,'' said H. Ray Gamble, a USDA scientist who developed a
blood test that detects the parasite in live pigs.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for trichinae-free certification under the new
program, farmers must be audited by a USDA-accredited veterinarian,
who will be trained to check whether a herd has been exposed to
garbage or infected rodents and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Packing plants that participate in the program will have to keep
certified pigs separate from other hogs, and USDA inspectors will
spot-check to make sure the animals are free of the parasite.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which will be tested starting this fall with
packing plants in Minnesota and Iowa, could start on a full-scale
basis by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   ''This program really goes beyond trichinae. What we're
developing is a model for pre-harvest food safety to bring
food-safety assurances even more into the realm of the production
level,'' said Dave Pyburn, director of veterinary science for the
National Pork Producers Council.
</P>
<P>
   The next certification program is likely to target toxoplasma, a
parasite that cats can spread to hogs, said Gamble, the USDA
scientist. Toxoplasma is the reason pregnant women are advised not
to empty litter boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in the trichinae program heightened in 1994, when an
outbreak of hamburger-related E. coli poisonings raised public
alarms about bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has bothered me a lot that all of the emphasis on
preventing foodborne illness has been concentrated on the packing
house and the consumer and that we have not spent until very
recently very much time or energy or creativity in trying to stop
it at the farm,'' Foreman said.
</P>
<P>
   Pork should still be cooked to 160 degrees to guard against
harmful microbes, according to the government, but it does not have
to be well-done.
</P>
<P>
   Pork is best when some pink is left in the center and will still
have its natural juices at 160 degrees, according to the pork
council.

<HEADLINE> Firms Line Up To Sponsor Democrats  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Democratic National Committee is taking
its biggest donors out to the ball game, inviting them to breakfast
with Al Gore's campaign manager, and bringing them onto the dance
floor at the Paramount Studios.
</P>
<P>
   And four dozen companies, trade groups and lobbyists are picking
up the tab.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes for a cozy relationship, no question about it,'' said
Herbert Alexander, professor emeritus of political science at the
University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Republicans at their convention earlier in the month,
the DNC is using its quadrennial gathering to reward loyal
financial supporters of the party. Donors of as little as $1,000
have gotten invitations to some events; other soirees are
restricted to five- and six-figure contributors.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, donors were invited to the Conga Room, an old
Hollywood nightclub and restaurant, to listen to Latin music with
Joe Andrew, the party's national chairman. Sunday, they could
attend the Angels-Yankees baseball game. Later in the week was a
breakfast in a plush Beverly Hills hotel with Gore campaign manager
Donna Brazile and an after-hours dance party at the Paramount
studio lot.
</P>
<P>
   Invitations to these events also went out to the DNC's
''convention partners,'' the interest groups sponsoring the
activities. Many of the groups have issues pending before the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   For example:
</P>
<P>
   -- The American Society of Anesthesiologists, fighting against
proposed federal rules that would allow states to decide whether
nurse anesthetists could work on their own, without doctor
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   -- Three Bell operating companies -- BellSouth, Verizon (formerly
Bell Atlantic) and SBC Communications -- which would like the right
to carry data over long-distance lines, and AT&AMP;T, which is trying
to block such efforts.
</P>
<P>
   -- America Online, whose request to merge with Time Warner is
pending before the Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   -- United Parcel Service, seeking federal approval to deliver
parcels to China, which it now can do only as part of a joint
venture with a company owned by Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   -- The lawyer-lobbying firm of Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard,
McPherson and Hand, whose clients include Microsoft, being sued by
the Justice Department on antitrust grounds; the Healthcare
Leadership Council, which opposes new regulations on managed-care
health maintenance organizations, and three tobacco companies,
Philip Morris, RJR Nabisco and U.S. Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic National Committee spokesman Rick Hess said these
companies are not seeking any special favors in return for their
donations.
</P>
<P>
   ''They support the Democratic Party because the Democratic Party
has been the party of fiscal discipline and, along with the
American people, presided over the longest economy expansion in
history,'' Hess said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Judge Bans Reformist Book Sale  </HEADLINE>
By ALI AKBAR DAREINI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- A hard-line judge has banned the sale of a
book that implicates former government officials in the 1998
murders of five dissidents, the author's wife and publisher said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Saeed Mortazavi did not give any reasons for imposing the
ban on ''Tragedy of Democracy in Iran'' by Emadeddin Baqi, Baqi's
wife, Fatemeh Kamali, said.
</P>
<P>
   The book has gone through four editions, meaning a total print
order of 16,000 copies, since it was first published in May. An
official at the publisher, Nei, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed it had been ordered to remove the book, but would not
give details.
</P>
<P>
   Baqi, whose books are best sellers in Iran, has been in prison
since May after being convicted of insulting Islam in articles he
wrote last year for the now-banned Neshat newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Kamali said that she had informed her husband of the ban in a
telephone call to his prison.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Mortazavi is one of the magistrates behind the closure of
more than two dozen pro-reform newspapers since April.
</P>
<P>
   ''The book had been published with the authorization of the
Culture Ministry. The judge has no legal right to issue such an
order,'' Kamali said.
</P>
<P>
   She added she believed her husband's prison sentence had been
increased to 7&AMP;frac12; years from an initial 5&AMP;frac12; years because of the
book.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tragedy of Democracy in Iran'' implicates senior hard-liners --
including former Intelligence Minister Ali Fallahian and former
President Hashemi Rafsanjani -- in the murder of five pro-opposition
activists and writers in late 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Intelligence Ministry has admitted some of its agents were
involved in the murders, but said they were rogue operatives.
</P>
<P>
   The agents, who are in custody, are believed to be sympathetic
to hard-liners fighting a popular reform movement led by President
Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   The reformists won control of parliament in February's
legislative elections, but hard-liners still run the judiciary,
military and the broadcast network.
</P>
<P>
   Three writers or journalists have been detained in the past
week, joining two dozen already in Tehran's Evin prison. Most are
being held on the charge of ''insulting Islamic sanctities.''

<HEADLINE> Fiji's Ex-Leader Plans to Lobby UN  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Fiji's deposed prime minister Mahendra
Chaudhry said Saturday he would travel to the United Nations to
lobby for the restoration of democracy to the South Pacific nation.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry, who was ousted by a coup in May, said he would discuss
the possibility of sending U.N. troops to Fiji during the visit.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry said he would also planned to meet with officials at
the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, which represents former
British colonies.
</P>
<P>
   He did not name a date or location for the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry, Fiji's first ethnic Indian prime minister, was ousted
after failed businessman George Speight led an armed group into
Fiji's Parliament on May 19 and took dozens of lawmakers, including
Chaudhry, hostage. He claimed ethnic Indian Fijians, who make up 44
percent of the population, had too much power and were threatening
indigenous Fijian culture.
</P>
<P>
   His rebels held the hostages for eight weeks, freeing the last
of them only after the military discarded Fiji's multiracial
constitution, ousted the government and agreed to an amnesty for
the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ''The norms of democratic states are very clear, and the
Commonwealth must not be a hypocrite and bend the rules to permit
these people to just carry on,'' Chaudhry said Saturday in Sydney,
where he sought treatment for cracked ribs sustained in a beating
by coup rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ''There must be a return to democracy'' in Fiji, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Chaudhry also criticized the interim government that was
installed during the coup by a military-backed president.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government that is in place must not be given recognition
and the international community must insist there be a clean up of
the army,'' Chaudhry said.
</P>
<P>
   Speight was arrested late last month, just days after releasing
the last of the hostages. The coup leader is being held in pretrial
custody in a barbed wire pen on a prison island near Suva, Fiji's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Speight was charged with treason, a crime which
carries the death penalty in Fiji. Speight and a group of 14 key
supporters were remanded to custody until Aug. 25.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts from interview with Hillary Rodham Clinton  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Excerpts from an interview with first lady Hillary
Rodham
Clinton, who is running for the U.S. Senate from New York:
<TEXT>
<P>
   On her policy work behind the scenes at the White House and why
she is now beginning to stress it on the campaign trail:
</P>
<P>
   -''I want people to know that, because if someone's going to
claim I sat around eating bonbons for the last five or six years, I
think it's only fair that the truth come out.''
</P>
<P>
   On her speech Monday to the Democratic National Convention and
the Senate race in New York:
</P>
<P>
   -''One of the reasons that I'm so intent upon the Senate race in
New York is that I want to be partner with Al (Gore) and Joe
(Lieberman) in building on all the progress that we've made for
children in the last eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   On her opponent Rep. Rick Lazio's very brief appearance at the
Republican National Convention in Philadelphia:
</P>
<P>
   -''You know I'm proud to be a Democrat and I'm a Democrat
whether I'm in New York or Los Angeles. ... He seems to be
unwilling to be identified with the Republicans in New York and
certainly didn't want to be in Philadelphia. When he's in
Washington he's a very strong follower of the Republican
leadership. I find it curious that he doesn't seem to want New
Yorkers to know that.''
</P>
<P>
   On reports of tensions between the Clintons and the Gore
campaign:
</P>
<P>
   -''We are here to do everything we can to highlight the success
of the Clinton-Gore administration and promote the Gore-Lieberman
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   On Rep. Loretta Sanchez's decision to move a fund-raiser from
the Playboy Mansion:
</P>
<P>
   -''She did what the vice president asked her to do. It's his
convention and I think that's an appropriate response.''
</P>
<P>
   On whether she would return a campaign donation from Playboy's
Christie Hefner:
</P>
<P>
   -''Christie Hefner is someone who contributes to a lot of
different people and I don't find that inappropriate or
surprising.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican convention:
</P>
<P>
   -''We heard a lot about children in the other party's
convention, but their record doesn't match their rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   On her family:
</P>
<P>
   ''We are having a good time with our life. I'm having a great
time campaigning for the Senate.''

<HEADLINE> President and first lady to take Adirondack vacation  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) - The Clintons will celebrate the president's
54th birthday with a three-day getaway in the Adirondack Mountains,
Hillary Clinton said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to have a nice long weekend. I'm really looking
forward to it,'' the first lady said in an interview with The
Associated Press in Los Angeles, where she is attending the
Democratic Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said she, the president and daughter Chelsea will spend
Friday, Saturday and Sunday at a private home near Lake Placid. It
was unclear Saturday whose home would host the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't seen the property but it's described to me as very
beautiful - lots of woods and water,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the White House has booked 100 rooms at the Lake Placid
Holiday Inn for a presidential entourage.
</P>
<P>
   The president turns 54 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady and U.S. Senate candidate got into some hot water
with residents of New York's Adirondacks last year when an
unidentified adviser told the New York Daily News the Clintons
would never vacation in the ''fly infested'' Adirondacks.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton made a campaign swing through the picturesque
region in October 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons have made Martha's Vineyard their steady summer
getaway spot and spent a few days there earlier this month. The
first lady used the break to hold fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   But since Mrs. Clinton waded into the Senate race in New York,
they have also been fitting in some time to unwind upstate.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Clintons spent several days in Skaneateles in the
Finger Lakes region and went to the New York State Fair in
Syracuse. Aides say they may return again this year to visit the
State Fair that runs Aug. 24 to Sept. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Upstate New York is heavily Republican but the first lady has
spent a significant amount of time there courting support. Still,
recent polls show her trailing opponent U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio
upstate.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said the first lady planned a low-key trip and was not
expected to campaign.

<HEADLINE> Loretta Young Remembered  </HEADLINE>
By BOB THOMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In 90 feature movies from 1927 to 1953,
Loretta Young portrayed the essence of femininity, splendidly
coifed, handsomely dressed, her high-cheeked beauty augmented by
makeup artists, ready to be swept off her feet by Cary Grant, Clark
Gable, Tyrone Power and other leading men.
</P>
<P>
   Her essence carried over into television. Every week she began
''The Loretta Young Show'' by entering a room in the most elegant
of gowns and sweeping toward the camera to introduce a new episode.
</P>
<P>
   Glamour photographer John Engstead once observed another side of
Loretta Young. He recalled entering her Paramount dressing room one
evening during the mid 1930s:
</P>
<P>
   ''Her makeup was off, there were shadows under her eyes, and she
looked tired. I could not believe her telephone conversation. She
was reading the riot act to some studio executive. She told him in
no uncertain terms what she would and would not do, made herself
crystal clear and hung up.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was amazed by this transformation from the sweet, shy
Gretchen (her real name) to this strong businesswoman.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a side Loretta Young rarely revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike her contemporary, Joan Crawford, whose fierce
self-promotion was legendary, Young maintained an aura of
sweetness. She even exacted fines from any film worker who swore on
her sets.
</P>
<P>
   But no star could have maintained a 35-year career without an
iron will. She chose her projects with great care, and her
contracts assured that she would receive star treatment.
</P>
<P>
   She avoided confrontations with directors and co-stars, always
imposing her will with a velvet touch.
</P>
<P>
   With ''The Loretta Young Show,'' she was able to maintain almost
complete control; her then-husband, Thomas Lewis, was the producer.
She took part in the casting and the selection of stories. She
insisted that every episode of the anthology series (she appeared
in half of them) should contain an uplifting message.
</P>
<P>
   When the series went into syndication, she decreed that her
glamorous entrances be eliminated. She worried that over time her
gowns would appear dated.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962 she launched ''The New Loretta Young Show.'' It lasted
six months.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't like the things the producers offered, and they
didn't like the things that I offered,'' she explained afterward.
''So we reached an impasse.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That's all right,'' she had said. ''I don't feel any
compulsion to be acting again. I've been doing it since I was 12
years old, and that's enough for anyone. I must say I don't miss
getting up at 4 in the morning to be on the set and ready to shoot
at 9. Don't miss it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   After her television career ended, she became a businesswoman,
joining the Schick company with a division that marketed a
beauty-foam maker. She once told of her negotiations with a Schick
executive: ''I warned him that I wasn't the easiest person in the
world to work with. I don't say yes to everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Young returned to acting for the 1986 television movie
''Christmas Eve'' and the 1989 television movie ''Lady in a
Corner.''
</P>
<P>
   In later years she continued her longtime devotion to Catholic
charities and lived in Palm Springs with her third husband, dress
designer Jean Louis. He died in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Young died Saturday of ovarian cancer at 87.

<HEADLINE> Actress Loretta Young Dead  </HEADLINE>
By BOB THOMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Loretta Young, the elegant Hollywood beauty
who specialized in playing strong-willed heroines with firm
principles during a 26-year film career and went on to star in her
own television show, died Saturday of ovarian cancer. She was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Young, whose acting career extended from silent movies to
television and included an Academy Award for best actress in ''The
Farmer's Daughter,'' died at the home of her sister Georgiana
Montalban and actor Ricardo Montalban early Saturday morning, said
Norman Brokaw, her longtime agent and friend.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was an incredible lady,'' Brokaw said. ''I learned from
her that if you can handle yourself with class and dignity, you can
work as long as you want in this business.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1953 to 1963, Young appeared on television in more than 300
episodes of ''The Loretta Young Show,'' opening the program with
her much-satirized trademark of sweeping through a doorway, always
in a high-style gown. She was nominated seven times for Emmys as
best starring actress and won three times.
</P>
<P>
   ''During the series, I played every role possible -- Chinese,
Japanese, Swedish, Indian, old, ugly, young, pretty,'' she remarked
in a 1973 interview. ''It was a marvelous experience for an actress
to do everything she had ever wanted to do. I got it out of my
system.''
</P>
<P>
   She retired at the end of ''The New Loretta Young Show'' in
1963, devoting her time to charities and a line of beauty products
bearing her name. She returned to acting only briefly, appearing in
the television movie ''Christmas Eve'' in 1986 and, lastly, the
television movie ''Lady in a Corner'' in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   She appeared in 88 movies dating from 1927 to 1953. During her
Hollywood heyday, Young appeared opposite most of the top male
stars of her time, including Lon Chaney, John Barrymore, Clark
Gable, James Cagney, Spencer Tracy, Cary Grant and Robert Mitchum.
</P>
<P>
   A shapely beauty with large blue-gray eyes and high cheekbones,
Young starred at age 15 with Chaney in the 1928 film ''Laugh,
Clown, Laugh.'' She was never less than a star afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1929 and 1930 she appeared in 15 movies, including
''Broken Dishes'' with the hard-drinking actor Grant Withers.
</P>
<P>
   When she was 17, she eloped with him. They lived together for
eight months before she filed for divorce, claiming she paid most
of the bills. Young never spoke of the marriage, and it never
appeared in her official biography.
</P>
<P>
   Her career flourished in the 1930s, with contracts with Warner
Bros.-First National and then 20th Century-Fox. In 1934 she
appeared in 10 films, including ''Born to Be Bad,'' ''The House of
Rothschild,'' ''The Devil to Pay,'' ''Caravan,'' Cecil B. DeMille's
''The Crusades,'' ''Call of the Wild'' and ''Shanghai.''
</P>
<P>
   In the '40s she made such films as ''The Story of Alexander
Graham Bell,'' ''The Doctor Takes a Wife,'' ''Bedtime Story,''
''The Lady from Cheyenne,'' ''China,'' ''Along Came Jones'' and
''The Stranger.''
</P>
<P>
   After 20 years of stardom, her career seemed ready for the
inevitable decline. Then producer Dore Schary offered her ''The
Farmer's Daughter.'' The role was that of a maid elected to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you mean you want me to play it with a Swedish accent, a
blond wig and all?'' Young had asked. ''Isn't that dangerous?''
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes, but it could also win you an Academy Award,'' Schary had
said.
</P>
<P>
   No one else thought so, not with Rosalind Russell the heavy
favorite for ''Mourning Becomes Electra.''
</P>
<P>
   When Young was announced as best actress of 1947, the audience
gasped in surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ''At long last!'' she sighed as she held the Oscar. The award
sustained her career, and she went on to such films as ''The
Bishop's Wife,'' ''Come to the Stable,'' ''Mother Was a Freshman''
and ''Because of You''. Her last feature came in 1953 with ''It
Happens Every Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Pictures were great, but there was no real communication with
the audience,'' she said in a 1966 interview. ''The other aspects
of being a movie star I can't knock: the fame, the grand houses,
the glamour, the money, friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The actress also contributed to Roman Catholic charities,
including a home for unwed mothers and a children's foundation. She
insisted on propriety on her movie sets, and even enforced a kitty
for her charities, to which set workers contributed a coin every
time they swore. Legend has it that on ''Rachel and the Stranger,''
the irreverent Mitchum loosed a spate of profanity and dropped $5
into the kitty.
</P>
<P>
   Young's daughter Judy Lewis, adopted in the mid-'30s, claims
Young hid one lapse from traditional morality. In a 1994 book,
''Uncommon Knowledge,'' Lewis claimed she was the result of an
affair between a married Gable and Young. According to Lewis, Young
had her baby in secret in late 1935, then eventually ''adopted''
the child when she was 2.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman denied it, and in a 1995 New York Times interview,
Young refused to discuss the story, calling it a ''rumor of a
bygone time,'' and adding, ''I have made peace with my daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   She was born Gretchen Young on Jan. 6, 1913, in Salt Lake City,
where her father was a railroad auditor. She had a younger brother,
Jack, and two older sisters, Polly Ann and Elizabeth, who had her
own movie career as Sally Blane.
</P>
<P>
   When Young was 3, her father abandoned the family. Her mother
moved the children to Los Angeles and opened a boarding house. She
later married and had a fourth daughter, Georgiana.
</P>
<P>
   An uncle in the movie business found work for the girls as
extras, and Young started when she was 5. Eight years later,
director Mervyn Leroy called the Young house with a role for Polly
Ann in ''Naughty but Nice.'' ''Polly Ann isn't here; will I do?''
Young inquired. She made her acting debut in the comedy, and the
star, Colleen Moore, changed the 13-year-old's name to Loretta.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout her career and afterward, she always appeared the
movie queen, with perfect coiffure and makeup, dressed in the
latest fashion, upbeat in her view of life.
</P>
<P>
   After the end of her TV series, she pursued the things denied
her during the hectic years in the studios.
</P>
<P>
   ''I decided the whole world was a soundstage, and I wanted to
see it,'' she told a reporter in 1986. ''I traveled for two years.
When I came back, I wasn't anxious to return to work, and I didn't
need to financially. Suddenly the years slipped by. I was living my
life. It was quiet when I wanted it quiet and exciting when I
wanted it exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for ''Christmas Eve'' in 1986, she stayed out of the
limelight, pursuing her charities and spending time with her
family.
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, she married broadcast executive Thomas Lewis, and they
had two sons, Christopher and Peter. The couple divorced in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1993, Young surprised her friends by marrying fashion
designer Jean Louis. She was 80; he was 85.
</P>
<P>
   She told Daily Variety: ''We've known each other for so long.
And when something is right, it just slips into place.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean Louis died in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Young is survived by her sister and three children.

<HEADLINE> Combat exercise brings thousands of soldiers back to Rome  </HEADLINE>
With AP Photo
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME, N.Y. (AP) - It looks like old times at the former Griffiss
Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Army National Guard military exercise is bringing
thousands of troops from across New York and 11 other states for
Exercise Empire Peak, simulating the activation and deployment of
National Guard forces into combat.
</P>
<P>
   It's part of the annual training for New York's highest priority
command - the 27th Separate Infantry Brigade (Enhanced).
</P>
<P>
   The exercise is meant to prepare troops for an exercise next
year at the Army's Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort Polk,
La., Lt. Col. Paul Fanning said Friday. Griffiss was chosen because
it mirrored facilities and conditions at Fort Polk.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, soldiers will board Blackhawk helicopters at
Griffiss and take off for a night air assault into one of Fort
Drum's training areas. The assault will secure a dirt airstrip for
C-130 aircraft to bring more troops and equipment from Griffiss
through the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, military convoys will leave Griffiss and
travel from Rome to Boonville. From there, they'll turn north to
Fort Drum.
</P>
<P>
   Troops will be carrying arms and will assume defensive positions
as though traveling to a hostile site, Fanning said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Realism and authenticity is the bottom line of the exercise,''
he said. ''This is not easy. It's very sophisticated and
challenging.''
</P>
<P>
   This will be the largest military gathering at the former base
since it closed five years ago. The site is now known as Griffiss
Business and Technology Park.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've been coming in since last Sunday, usually in the
morning,'' Dunkin Donuts manager Kristi Serra said of the soldiers.
''It's nice to have them back even if it is temporary.''

<HEADLINE> Fleisher Tops Canada Senior Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Bruce Fleisher made a 20-foot birdie
putt from the fringe on the last hole Saturday for a share of the
lead in the AT&AMP;T Canada Senior Open.
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher, the Senior PGA Tour's top money winner this season
with just over $1.8 million, is tied with Tom Jenkins at 10-under
206 through 54 holes at St. Charles Golf and Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ''It surprised the heck out of me when it went in,'' said
Fleisher, referring to the long putt on the par-5 18th that capped
off a round of 4-under 68. ''I got it rolling pretty good. I'm just
glad it hit the center of the hole.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Fleisher had a disastrous final hole, stumbling in
with a double-bogey. So instead of being tied with the leaders, he
started the third round two shots back at 6 under.
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher, seeking his fifth victory of the year, felt fortunate
to be in front.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not that comfortable with this golf course, especially
when it's this windy,'' Fleisher said. ''I think my experience and
a bit of patience helped me through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, the second-round leader at 8 under, shot a 70.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't feel like I am hitting the ball all that well, but I'm
putting pretty good,'' he said. ''When the wind blows like this,
you're forced to start playing some very different shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher and Jenkins will be joined in the final threesome by
Doug Tewell, whose 68 left him alone in third at 205. Ed Dougherty
is at 204 after a solid 69.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicklaus went on a bit of a birdie run on the back nine to
excite the huge crowd that followed him. He birdied the 12th, 14th
and 15th holes to move to 6 under, but bogeyed the par-4 16th when
his tee shot took a bad hop. He shot a 70 for a 5-under 211 total.
</P>
<P>
   ''I moved up a bit, but I'll need to be in the mid-60s to win,''
Nicklaus said. ''At least I'm in contention. I haven't had a chance
to win a golf tournament in a long time, so that feels nice.''

<HEADLINE> Haiti Attackers Target EU Official  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Attackers lobbed a firebomb into
the garden of a European Union official's home, a diplomat said
Saturday, in the latest attack against foreign officials and their
property.
</P>
<P>
   The Molotov cocktail burst into flames at the home of EU
agriculture consultant Pierre-Yves Baulain in suburban Petionville,
said a high-ranking European diplomat and several other diplomats
who spoke on condition that they were not further identified.
</P>
<P>
   Baulain was on leave in his home country France, and the
explosive did not cause any property damage.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials could not immediately be reached Saturday to
confirm the report.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union, United States and Canada have all threatened
to withhold aid over concerns about the results of elections in
May, June and July. They say some results were incorrectly computed
giving victories to candidates from the Lavalas Family party.
</P>
<P>
   The vote gave Lavalas, the party of former President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, control of both houses of parliament and
most local councils and city halls. Aristide also is favored to win
the presidential election on Nov. 26.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of American States and international donors
have urged Haiti to hold new elections for 10 disputed Senate
seats.
</P>
<P>
   On July 27, unidentified attackers threw a grenade into the
driveway of Canadian ambassador Gilles Bernier, slightly damaging
his vehicle. Bernier was in Canada at the time.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of the attack on Bernier's residence, authorities
found another grenade in the courtyard of the former headquarters
of the U.N. civilian mission, in suburban Delmas. Police detonated
the grenade, and there were no injuries or damage.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, gunmen shot and killed U.N. employee Garfield Lyle, a
Guyanese national, at the wheel of his vehicle. Police are still
investigating.
</P>
<P>
   No one has claimed responsibility for the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti has been without a parliament since January 1999, when
President Rene Preval, an Aristide ally, locked lawmakers out of
Parliament after an 18-month power struggle with the majority
party.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Surin Leads Track Trials  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VICTORIA, British Columbia (AP) -- Bruny Surin overcame a tight
hamstring to win the 100 meters Saturday at the Canadian track and
field championships and earn an Olympic berth.
</P>
<P>
   Surin, silver medalist at the 1999 world championships, was
clocked in 10.05 seconds, his best time of the year. He felt the
hamstring tighten during the race but said it shouldn't be a factor
leading to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Brad McCuaig was second in 10.18, followed by Pierre Brown in
10:25.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan Bailey, the former world record holder and 1996 Olympic
champion in the 100, didn't race because of a hurt hamstring. But
he was given an injury exemption and is on the Canadian team for
the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   High jumper Mark Boswell shook off ankle and hip injuries to win
his first Canadian title by clearing 7 feet, 7 inches.
</P>
<P>
   In other events, Esi Benyarku won the women's 100 in 11.30, and
Adrian Woodley defended his Canadian title in the 110-metre hurdles
in 13.67.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Expel Families in Chiapas  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) -- Zapatista rebels
forced more than 100 government supporters from their homes in a
small Chiapas village Saturday in the latest round of a series of
sometimes-violent land disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels claiming they owned the land yanked 120 people from their
homes in the mostly indigenous village of Nuevo Pavoreal, said
Miguel Angel Yanes, assistant district attorney for the area.
</P>
<P>
   Several residents were injured and forced to take refuge in a
nearby coffee warehouse, Yanes said.
</P>
<P>
   The ousted residents support the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party. Pro-government paramilitary groups and rebels
have clashed frequently since the 1994, when the Zapatistas
launched their uprising to demand more democracy and Indian rights.
Some of the confrontations have been over land.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 3, presumed paramilitaries armed with assault rifles
expelled about 90 Zapatista sympathizers from their homes in the
tiny Chiapas village of Paraiso, accusing them of stealing the
land.
</P>
<P>
   The attackers were likely residents of a nearby village who for
years have been locked in a dispute with the pro-rebel villagers
over about 500 acres of land.
</P>
<P>
   Government commissions had apparently given both groups title to
the disputed land.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a pro-government paramilitary group massacred 45 rebel
sympathizers in the Chiapas hamlet of Acteal.

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Frerotte Concedes QB Job  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREELEY, Colo. (AP) -- Although Denver Broncos coach Mike
Shanahan insists the starting quarterback job is still open, Gus
Frerotte thinks otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Just three weeks into training camp, Frerotte said that barring
injury, Brian Griese will be the starter this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've gone through camp now and he's going to be the
starter,'' Frerotte said Friday as the Broncos prepared for
Sunday's preseason game against the Green Bay Packers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yeah, that's just the way it is,'' Frerotte said. ''He's been
in this system, he's been with the coaches, he's been with the
players. This is how it had to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Frerotte doesn't harbor any ill feelings towards Griese, who
replaced John Elway as the Broncos' starter last season.
</P>
<P>
   ''Brian played well,'' Frerotte said. ''You have to hand it to
him. He came out every day and he worked hard. Neither one of us
missed a throw at all. We threw 300, 400 balls a day and we pushed
each other. I don't have any animosity toward him or anything like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   More than three weeks before the Sept. 4 season opener at St.
Louis, Shanahan declined to announce his starter.
</P>
<P>
   ''If someone thinks he'll be second team, that's up to him,''
Shanahan said. ''But what I try to do is sit back and look at every
practice and look at every game and see how people perform and then
make decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Frerotte, 29, finds himself in a similar role to the one he had
in Detroit last season when he backed up Charlie Batch, who was
drafted ahead of Griese in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Frerotte, who signed a 1-year deal with the Broncos in March,
said he does not regret his decision to sign with Denver rather
than return to Detroit, where Batch is recovering from a broken
right leg.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd prefer the chance to become a starter. I don't see myself
as a backup. That's just my nature,'' he said. ''If it happens all
year where Brian starts every game, so be it.''

<HEADLINE> Swimmer Quann Predicts Gold Future  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Megan Quann snuggles up each night with a
stopwatch in her hand. As she drifts off, the 16-year-old swimmer's
head is filled with goal times for the 100-meter breaststroke and
thoughts of beating Olympic champion Penny Heyns in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's going down,'' Quann predicted. ''I'm going to be there,
race my heart out and win that gold.''
</P>
<P>
   Brash words indeed, but Quann possesses the speed, confidence
and fearlessness that seemingly belong to every young swimmer.
</P>
<P>
   She set an American record of 1 minute, 7.12 seconds in the 100
breast preliminaries Thursday in the U.S. Olympic trials. She then
fell short of her world record prediction in Friday's final, but
still won in 1:07.26.
</P>
<P>
   She'll try to make the team in the 200 breast beginning with
Sunday's prelims.
</P>
<P>
   ''I plan on taking that one, too,'' she said. ''I like being the
number one seed and having some tough competition.''
</P>
<P>
   A rivalry with her brother, who's two years older, helped
develop Quann's confidence. As a 6-year-old, she couldn't complete
one lap of the pool.
</P>
<P>
   ''I absolutely hated it,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, her father enrolled his kids in lessons to
keep them from spending the summer watching television. Quann
struggled again, needing to stop six times during a lap of
freestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Told to try breaststroke, Quann didn't know how and became
embarrassed in front of the other kids. The instructors placed her
in a group of 5- and 6-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   ''That motivated me to do much better,'' she said. ''I went to
my first swim meet and won every event I raced. It all started off
with me against my brother.''
</P>
<P>
   She's never lost that competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   On the closet door of Quann's bedroom in Puyallup, Wash., is
posted the world breaststroke rankings. Each time she beats one of
the times she crosses it off.
</P>
<P>
   Her goal is 1:05.49. Heyns' world record is 1:06.52
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll go that 1:05,'' she said. ''I visualize my races every
night before I go to bed. I visualize everything going perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   Most amazing about Quann's American record in the trials is that
it came without her tapering, a process in which swimmers gradually
decrease their yardage and weight training leading up to a major
meet.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week, Quann was swimming 15,000 meters daily -- about
nine miles. She cut back to 7,000 meters last Monday -- still a
large amount.
</P>
<P>
   But it's nothing compared to the 50,000 meters she once swam
over a 24-hour period with her club team.
</P>
<P>
   Quann does all this despite the nearest pool being 45 minutes
from her house. Her day begins at 4:30 a.m. She swims from 6-8
a.m., goes to school for 4&AMP;frac12; hours, hits the gym for an hour, then
swims from 6-8 p.m. In between, she spends 2-3 hours commuting
daily.
</P>
<P>
   And yeah, she finds time for fun at the movies, the mall and
hiking near Mount Rainier with her friends and teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm having a blast,'' she said. ''This is the time of my life.
I just made the Olympics.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Girl Escapes From Kidnapper  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- An 8-year-old girl missing for three
days made a daring escape from her abductor Saturday, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's disappearance Thursday a few blocks from her home had
stirred memories of another girl's disappearance eight months
earlier from a bus stop about two miles away. Police say they found
no evidence of a link between the two cases.
</P>
<P>
   Midsi Sanchez had her hands restrained in her abductor's
vehicle, but was able to free herself, bolt from the car and flag
down a passing truck driver in Santa Clara, a police spokesman said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''She did all the right things. Her instincts were very good for
an 8-year-old,'' said Anton Morec, a spokesman for the police
department in Santa Clara, about 70 miles south of the girl's
Vallejo home.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said they had strong leads, but hadn't arrested
anybody in connection with the girl's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez was to be examined at an area hospital for injuries and
reunited with her parents Saturday.

<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Jason Giambi hit his 30th home run and
Ben Grieve added a three-run homer as the Oakland Athletics stopped
a six-game losing streak Saturday with a 9-5 victory over the
Detroit Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hudson (13-4) took a one-hit shutout in the seventh, then
was chased and wound up allowing four runs and five hits in
six-plus innings. Hudson, coming off a 13-0 loss to the Chicago
White Sox, is 4-0 against Detroit in four career starts.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Bernero (0-1), making his third major league start, lost in
his first decision. Bernero, who attended high school in nearby
Sacramento, gave up four runs, six hits and three walks in 4 2-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Stairs hit a sacrifice fly in the second and Giambi hit a
two-run homer in the third, giving him 101 RBIs. He joined Jose

straight years.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Tejada's RBI double made it 4-0 in the fifth, and the A's
added two runs in the sixth on Stairs' sacrifice fly and Eric
Chavez's run-scoring grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Palmer homered leading off the seventh, and consecutive
singles by Damion Easley, Brad Ausmus and Jose Macias loaded the
bases and finished Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Deivi Cruz and Billy McMillon hit RBI singles off Jim Mecir, and
Bobby Higginson's run-scoring groundout pulled the Tigers to 6-4.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> US Swim Trials Notebook  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Gold medalist Tom Dolan doesn't like the
idea of sharing the pool with 1,300 other swimmers at the U.S.
Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
   Dolan, who will get a chance to defend his title in the
400-meter individual medley in the Sydney Games after making the
American team Thursday, is one of the strongest critics of the
decision to expand the trials.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, there were 570 competitors in the trials. This
year, there were 1,309 entrants at the Indiana University
Natatorium for the eight-day meet. That makes for a crowded pool
during warm-up and practice sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like World War III out there,'' Dolan said. ''You're
throwing elbows at 14-year-old kids. It's ridiculous. I lay awake
at night wondering who makes these decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   USA Swimming lowered the qualifying standards for the trials,
hoping to give younger swimmers a chance to gain valuable
experience and also compensate for not having a national
championship in this Olympic year.
</P>
<P>
   Dolan scoffs at the logic, saying ''we're supposed to be here
picking an Olympic team.''
</P>
<P>
   He also criticized the decision to have the trials in August, a
mere month away from the lighting of the flame in Sydney. According
to Dolan, the sport could have generated more media coverage if the
Olympic team had been picked a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was a terrible decision, as bad a decision has USA
Swimming has made,'' he said. ''That sums up the small thinkers in
the sport compared with the big thinkers. Some people say we would
get too much publicity and put the swimmers under too much pressure
by having the trials earlier. I thought that was the point -- to
make the sport bigger and more popular.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   DON'T COUNT HER OUT: Angie Wester-Krieg is already the oldest
woman in the U.S. Olympic swim trials -- and she's still not
thinking about retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old swimmer from Campbell, Calif., doesn't even rule
out coming back in four years for another trials.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be jumping the gun to say I'm going to do it or I'm
not going to do it,'' said Wester-Krieg, competing in her record
sixth trials.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, she finished 25th in the 200-meter butterfly,
failing to advance to the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just like being an athlete,'' Wester-Krieg said. ''I thank
God that he provided me with the ability to do that at this level
for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Peter Krieg, is also her coach.
</P>
<P>
   ''He told me, joking around, that if we come to another trials,
he wants to have a 2-year-old right here,'' Wester-Krieg said,
patting her hip. ''He's so understanding about my lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   She also works 20 hours a week as a tax consultant in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't say I'm not tired when the alarm clock goes off in the
morning,'' Wester-Krieg said. ''But training is what I enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   TOWERING SHEALY: At 6-foot-3, Courtney Shealy towers over most
women. Those extra inches might have helped her make the Olympics
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Shealy provided one of the biggest surprises in the early days
of the trials when she finished second in the 100-meter backstroke,
earning a spot on the team that will be heading to Sydney. She beat
out American record holder Lea Maurer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess my 6-3 helps my reach,'' Shealy said. ''I've never
been ashamed of my height. It definitely helped me here.''
</P>
<P>
   Shealy, of Columbia, S.C., was part of University of Georgia
teams that won back-to-back national championships. She also played
volleyball for the Lady Bulldogs, becoming the first Division I
female athlete to compete in two sports on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Shealy didn't expect to make the team in the 100 backstroke,
figuring her best chance would come in the 100 freestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ''Total shock,'' she said, ''but a very excellent surprise.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   MOTHER AND COACH: Renee Riggs stands out at the Indiana
University Natatorium, coaching swimmers while lugging a
5-month-old baby on her chest.
</P>
<P>
   Riggs and her husband, Victor, are coaching 17-year-old Kaitlin
Sandeno, who already has made her first Olympic team. The couple
also is getting used to life with their first child, Abigail.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's very good-natured,'' Renee Riggs said while the infant
gnawed on an entry sheet in her mother's hands. ''We're very lucky.
She's easily entertained.''
</P>
<P>
   Riggs takes special precautions when strolling around the
crowded, slippery deck.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to be really careful,'' she said. ''When I'm walking
around, I hold her arms in so they don't get whacked.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she may be carrying around a future Olympian.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's already been swimming,'' Riggs said. ''She splashes her
hands and gets her face wet.''

   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Ritchie Kotschau scored the game-winner
in the 77th minute, spoiling Giovanni Savarese's debut with San
Jose, as the Tampa Bay Mutiny beat the Earthquakes 2-1 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Kotschau took a pass from Carlos Valderrama down the left side,
and angled a crossing shot toward the goal. The ball went over
goalkeeper Joe Cannon's head, hit the top of the right post and
went into the back of the net for Kotschau's first score of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Earthquakes (5-13-8) matched a club record with their fifth
straight loss, despite holding a 23-8 advantage in shots.
</P>
<P>
   Savarese, the MLS' fifth all-time leading goal scorer, had an
assist on Khodadad Azizi's goal in the 52nd minute.
</P>
<P>
   Mamadou Diallo, the league's leading scorer, gave Tampa Bay
(14-10-2) a 1-0 lead in the ninth minute.
</P>
<P>
   Mutiny goalkeeper Scott Garlick had 10 saves, while Cannon had
one.

<HEADLINE> Newton Wins US Women's Amateur  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Marcy Newton won the 100th U.S. Women's
Amateur on Saturday, beating Laura Myerscough 8 and 7 in the
36-hole final at Waverley Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Newton, 22, of High Point, N.C., joins Dorothy Delasin, Kelli
Kuehne, Pat Hurst, JoAnne Gunderson Carner and Patricia Lesser as
the only women to win U.S. Amateur and U.S. Girls titles.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's such an honor to be a USGA champion two times now,'' said
Newton, the recent University of North Carolina graduate who won
the 1995 Girls championship.
</P>
<P>
   ''To be part of a short list, maybe five women, that have won
the junior and the amateur, it's a dream come true.''
</P>
<P>
   Newton, who plans to turn pro, jumped in front with a birdie on
the second hole. Myerscough stayed within two holes through the
first 10, but Newton pushed her advantage to 6-up by the end of the
morning round.
</P>
<P>
   After the two players exchanged birdies on the first two holes
of the afternoon round, Newton won the third, fifth and seventh
holes to take a 9-up lead. Myerscough could do no better than halve
the next four holes and when she conceded a bogey putt on No. 11,
Newton had her second national amateur title in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Myerscough, 20, of Charleston, Ill., won two of her first three
tournament matches by 1-up scores, then had to go 19 holes to win
her quarterfinal match against Lorena Ochoa of Mexico. This time
there would be no chance for late-round heroics
</P>
<P>
   Down by two going into the seventh hole of the morning round,
the University of Arizona player went from the right rough on her
drive to the left rough with her second shot. Her third shot, a
greenside chip, hit a tree and bounced backward. It took her five
strokes to reach the green on the par-4, 371-yard hole. Newton
wound up with a birdie on that hole to go 3-up.
</P>
<P>
   There was more trouble on No. 12 when Myerscough hooked her
drive under a tree and wound up with a double bogey. That put
Newton 4-up even though she hit her approach wide of the green and
had to scramble for a par.
</P>
<P>
   Newton parred the final two holes of the morning round and that
was good enough to add two holes to her lead as Myerscough bogeyed
and double bogeyed.

<P>
   After shooting an 84 in the morning round, Myerscough realized
she might have been nervous than she first thought.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my swing, I could tell myself that I wasn't nervous or
tight, but I really was. It's like your body doesn't turn, so
you're going to get some ugly shots. I didn't trust my swing.
That's what you've got to do under the gun,'' said Myerscough, who
was selected to the world amateur team after the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Newton was closing in on her victory by the time they got to the
27th hole. Both players left the par-3 hole with pars after Newton
conceded Myerscough's 3-foot putt.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was 8-up with 10 holes or something like that to play,''
Newton said. ''I didn't want that to make or break her. ... I
didn't want to go one more up because of that little putt. It just
felt like the right thing to do.''

<HEADLINE> Iraq Criticizes S. Arabia, Kuwait  </HEADLINE>
By WAIEL FALEH
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- An allied airstrike hit a warehouse storing
humanitarian aid, killing two people, Iraqi officials said,
prompting Baghdad to accuse Saudi Arabia and Kuwait on Saturday of
backing aggression.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's strike, U.S. and British planes struck in the city
of Samawa, 168 miles south of Baghdad, hitting the main food ration
distribution center used to store food allowed under the U.N.
oil-for-food deal, Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Along with two civilians killed, 19 others were injured, Iraqi
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   President Saddam Hussein met Saturday with his two top ruling
councils -- the Regional Command of the al-Baath ruling party and
the Revolutionary Command Council -- and discussed the ''aggression
which destroys Iraqi properties with American backing and
Saudi-Kuwaiti support,'' the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Saudis are first in aggression followed by the Kuwaiti
rulers in treason,'' the council said in a statement carried by
INA.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has criticized Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, along with Turkey,
for allowing American and British allies to use their bases for
daily flights over the no-fly zones of northern and southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq also blames the Kuwaitis and Saudis for the U.N. sanctions
imposed on its 22 million people since Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq says allied airstrikes have killed more than 300 citizens
and injured at least 900 others. The allies dispute these figures
and say their strikes are made in self defense when planes
patrolling the no fly zones are targeted by Iraqi air defenses.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Central Command said that allied aircraft struck two
Iraqi air defense sites on Saturday after anti-aircrafy artillery
opened fire on planes patrolling the zone. There was no immediate
report on damage.
</P>
<P>
   The command said in a statement from its headquarters in Florida
that on Friday coalition planes struck two command posts and a
surface-to-air missile site. It made no mention of Iraq's claims of
two dead, but said allied airstrikes ''do not target civilian
populations or infrastructure'' and seek to avoid civilian
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Ali, spokesman from the Samawa governate, said Friday's
strike hit six residential houses and several government buildings,
as well as the warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing ''is a criminal act committed by the American and
British administrations,'' Saleh told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The news agency INA said the strikes were in response to a
speech by Saddam on Tuesday in which he said his Gulf neighbors had
''sold their souls'' to the United States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent Saturday to the United Nations, Foreign
Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf accused the Saudi and Kuwaiti
governments of ''providing logistical support for the American and
British forces, making them contributing partners in the
aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   The foreign minister demanded that the U.N. Security Council
''rise up to its responsibilities in keeping the international
security and peace by stopping the continued aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain have been enforcing zones since
the end of the 1991 Gulf War. The zones were set up to protect
Shiite Muslim rebels in the south and Kurdish insurgents in the
north from attacks by Iraq's army.

<HEADLINE> Protestants March in N. Ireland  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland (AP) -- More than 20,000
Protestants filled the streets of Londonderry Saturday with British
flags and banners declaring ''No Surrender'' -- a defiant
demonstration made possible by a deal with leaders of this mostly
Catholic city.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the clamor, there were hopeful signs that common sense can
prevail in Northern Ireland after years of march-fueled violence.
Most Catholics stayed at home or went shopping in nearby malls as
the Apprentice Boys brotherhood, a historic symbol of Protestant
dominance, commemorated the days when Protestants controlled this
17th-century fortress city.
</P>
<P>
   The 2&AMP;frac12;-hour parade passed with little tension except at its most
sensitive spot -- the central square within the city walls known as
the Diamond, a venue for sectarian riots since the early 19th
century.
</P>
<P>
   A few hundred Catholics walked up from the nearby Bogside
quarter. A minority were armed with beer bottles, which they hurled
over police lines at the marchers.
</P>
<P>
   One struck a member of a so-called ''kick the pope'' band,
provoking a furious but brief attempt by bandsmen to get past
police. Nobody was reported seriously hurt, and Apprentice Boy
stewards quickly intervened to ensure that the parade proceeded
across the River Foyle into Londonderry's mostly Protestant east
side.
</P>
<P>
   The parade came at a crucial time for this British-linked
province, which has been torn for decades by sectarian violence but
has enjoyed a measure of self-rule in recent months under a 1998
peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   The annual Apprentice Boys parade commemorates the 1689
bombardment of the city's Protestant garrison by forces loyal to a
Catholic king, James II. The starving inhabitants were saved on
Aug. 12 after a 105-day siege when a flotilla of English supply
ships broke through a boom placed across the Foyle.
</P>
<P>
   The group is named for 13 youthful apprentices who, as legend
has it, bolted the city gates in the face of James' approaching
soldiers. Their move defied the city's compromise-minded governor,
who wanted to talk rather than fight.
</P>
<P>
   Today's governor of the Apprentice Boys, Alistair Simpson,
defended his decision to negotiate directly earlier this week with
militant Catholics who in previous years tried to block the parade.
Other Protestant marching groups, particularly the Orange Order,
have shunned direct talks -- a factor in last month's widespread
Protestant rioting when British authorities restricted several
Orange parades.
</P>
<P>
   ''My first duty is to this city and to do what I can to keep the
peace,'' said Simpson, who first began talking face-to-face with
protesters in 1998 in hopes of softening hostility to the parade.
''Thankfully that's been the result today. Long may it continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressure for compromise from the city's Catholic businesspeople
played an important part in persuading Catholics to call off all
protests this year. Rioting by Catholic youths following Apprentice
Boys demonstrations in 1998 and 1999 caused more than $15 million
in damage, mostly to Catholic-owned businesses that dominate the
city center.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was appeased, though.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Apprentice Boys from Belfast, 70 miles east of
Londonderry, had to arrive by bus rather than train because a
series of bomb threats closed the main Belfast-to-Londonderry rail
line. Police searches found no bomb, and train service resumed in
the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, Londonderry police tried to intercept a van
carrying about 500 pounds of homemade explosives into the city, but
the vehicle sped back to the nearby border with the Irish Republic
and was abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the outlawed Loyalist Volunteer Force released a
statement saying it would shoot anyone who attacks Protestant
homes.
</P>
<P>
   It joined fellow pro-British loyalist group, The Ulster Defense
Association, which earlier reinstated its threat to break a
cease-fire and defend areas under attack from Catholic
nationalists. The move came after attacks on Protestant homes
Thursday night, which were blamed on republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Londonderry's long-dominant Catholic politician, Social
Democratic and Labor Party leader John Hume, condemned those who
would try to launch attacks as ''fascists'' who were trying ''to
subvert the will of the Irish people.''
</P>
<P>
   Hume, a moderate, began brokering negotiations between the
Apprentice Boys and Catholics in 1996. He said most Catholics would
accept Apprentice Boys parades so long as marchers negotiated
conditions with Catholic representatives.

<HEADLINE> Elephant Trainer Has Circus Funeral  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- Albert ''Shorty'' Sharp spent more than
50 of his 82 years caring for circus elephants. On Saturday, the
big pachyderms were as involved in Sharp's funeral as they were in
his life.
</P>
<P>
   The imposing Broadway Bo opened the outdoor service by pounding
on a drum with a mallet held in his trunk. The smaller Buddy
brought it to a close, pulling Sharp's casket on a cart to the
gravesite.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp died May 12 of heart failure while traveling with the
circus in Wisconsin. His body was frozen so his friends could
attend his funeral when the circus took a break from the road. He
had no living relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''For over 50 years, Albert Sharp dedicated his life to getting
up early in the morning, taking care of the elephants and getting
his cup of coffee,'' said circus owner George Carden, who delivered
the eulogy for his long-time employee.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-foot-7 Sharp came to work as an elephant handler for
Carden's father about 25 years ago and stayed on as caretaker at
the headquarters of George Carden Circus International in
Springfield after he retired.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 people attended the memorial service held there
Saturday. One woman stopped to tuck a small stuffed elephant into
Sharp's open casket.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Sharp's possessions were on display in front of a stage
built at one end of the tent where the service was held: his
collection of elephant figurines, his white-fringed leather jacket
and black cowboy hat, and the golf cart he used to zip around the
Carden grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The rest remained in Sharp's off-season home, a small
corrugated-metal house a few yards away.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will continue to stay marked 'Shorty's Place,''' Carden
said, referring to a sign on the fence around the house. ''Kind of
like a little museum.''

<HEADLINE> Payne Stewart Memorial Unveiled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- A statue of the late golf star Payne
Stewart was dedicated Saturday in his hometown, with Stewart's
mother pronouncing the bronze memorial ''perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Bee Payne-Stewart said she was pleased with ''the expression on
his face, and the fact that it's so huge, because he was a huge
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Lora Thomas, the late golfer's sister, spread some of his ashes
around the statue's base.
</P>
<P>
   About 600 people gathered on the east lawn of the Missouri
Sports Hall of Fame for the unveiling of the $175,000 memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart and five other people were killed Oct. 25 when, on a
flight from Florida to Texas, their jet veered off course and flew
unguided for hours, the victims apparently unconscious or already
dead. Finally, after running out of fuel, the plane plunged into a
South Dakota field.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's difficult to think sometimes that Payne is not here,''
said Hall of Fame board chairman Joe Greene. ''He was one of us. He
was the hometown hero made good.''
</P>
<P>
   And the way he handled his fame, Missouri Lt. Gov. Roger Wilson
said, was one of the many traits that set Stewart apart.
</P>
<P>
   ''Payne made a statement for the people of Missouri as a
professional golf star, but he was more than that,'' Wilson said.
''He got big, and he was able to handle it with style and grace,
something we should all aspire to.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buy.com Tour's Ozarks Open was being played in Springfield
this weekend in memory of Stewart, with some 1,200 volunteers all
wearing lapel pins bearing his silhouette.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems like not a move is made here at the Ozarks Open
without remembrance of Payne,'' said Jerald Andrews, the tournament
director and Missouri Sports Hall of Fame executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews said it's not a coincidence that the statue of Stewart,
depicted with his swing's famed high finish, is facing north -- in
the direction of his home course, Hickory Hills Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope this statue does Payne justice,'' sculptor Harry Weber
said, ''but I think Payne built his own monument with all of those
who loved him.''

<HEADLINE> Verizon, union officials push ahead to forge contract  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Verizon Communications and two telephone
unions wrestled over required overtime and job security Saturday as
they sought to reach a contract that would end a week-old strike in
Eastern states.
</P>
<P>
   Communications Workers of America, the larger of the two
striking unions, reported little progress Saturday afternoon on
points it said were most critical to its members: forced overtime,
the shifting of work to cheaper areas and what the unions call
oppressively stressful conditions for customer service
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the company comes ready to work these out, we can reach a
settlement,'' said CWA spokesman Candice Johnson. She said
unrealistic call quotas and sales objectives have put undue
pressure on employees.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said they have had a good offer on the table
for more than a week and have tweaked it a number of times to deal
with union objections.
</P>
<P>
   But ''we need an agreement that gives Verizon the ability to
provide great service for its customers,'' spokesman Eric Rabe said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon says it relies on overtime to meet consumer demands, and
stringent hiring standards and a tight labor market make it
difficult to add new workers. The company contends it tries to
reduce inconvenience by scheduling overtime in advance.
</P>
<P>
   CWA also said the two sides are far apart in addressing the
matter of moving work outside the Middle Atlantic states. Unions
fear that Verizon - the product of a summer merger between Bell
Atlantic and GTE - will distribute work within its expanded
territory to areas where labor is cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials argue they need flexibility to shift calls to
other centers in their region to alleviate heavy volumes in certain
spots.
</P>
<P>
   The strike by CWA and the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers affects more than 25 million customers in
Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New
Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia,
West Virginia and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The work stoppage has left the company's 30,000 management
employees scrambling to process daily workloads that reach 80,000
repair orders. Verizon says there has been no discussion yet about
intervention by federal mediators.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials also say the company has failed to do anything
to lessen the impact on employees of a deal announced last week by
Verizon to merge its high-speed Internet business with NorthPoint
Communications Group, an upstart provider of that service.

<HEADLINE> Indians 5, Mariners 4  </HEADLINE>
By JIM COUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Bartolo Colon struck out eight in seven innings,
allowing just four hits as the Cleveland Indians beat the Seattle
Mariners 5-4 Saturday for their eighth win in 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   With the score 2-all in the fifth, Cleveland went ahead when
Kenny Lofton doubled to center off John Halama (10-6) and scored on
a double error -- first Mike Cameron kicked the ball, then shortstop
Alex Rodriguez's relay throw was wild, going past third baseman
Carlos Guillen and pitcher John Halama.
</P>
<P>
   David Segui had a two-run single in the eighth off Brett Tomko,
who loaded the bases on walks to Lofton and Omar Vizquel, a
sacrifice by Roberto Alomar and an intentional walk to Manny
Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle made it close in the bottom half when Rodriguez, who
went 3-for-4, hit an RBI single off Paul Shuey and Edgar Martinez
followed with a run-scoring single off Steve Karsay.
</P>
<P>
   With the bases loaded and one out, Rodriguez was thrown out at
the plate by Karsay on Jay Buhner's comebacker and Cameron hit into
an inning-ending fielder's choice.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Wickman got three outs for his fifth save in six chances,
his fifth since Cleveland acquired him from Milwaukee on July 28.
Stan Javier singled leading off the ninth, went to second on
Guillen's sacrifice and took third on Al Martin groundout, but Mark
McLemore popped out to shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland remained one game behind Oakland, the AL wild-card
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Colon (11-8) won his second straight decision following a
three-game losing streak, retiring 13 straight batters after
Rodriguez's third-inning double. He tied Baltimore's Mike Mussina
for second in the AL in strikeouts at 148, trailing only Boston's
Pedro Martinez (204).
</P>
<P>
   Halama allowed three runs -- two earned -- six hits and three
walks in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle took a 2-0 lead lead in the first on an RBI double by
Rodriguez and a run-scoring groundout by Martinez, who leads the
major leagues with 111 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland tied it in the second on Jim Thome's RBI double and
Travis Fryman's run-scoring, double-play grounder.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Indians have gone five games and 47 innings since their
last homer, in the fourth inning last Sunday. ... Seattle has been
in first place or tied for the AL West lead for 105 days this
season. The last day the Mariners weren't in first was June 28. ...
Alomar, who has won eight Gold Gloves, committed his 11th error of
the season, most by an Indians' fielder. ... The Mariners had their
45th sellout in their 100th game at Safeco Field. ... Rodriguez has
two errors in two days, giving the All-Star SS seven in 103 games.
... The Mariners are 61-39 in their first 100 games at Safeco.

<HEADLINE> Torrential rain causes heavy damage to Stratford  </HEADLINE>
dcfonstv
<TEXT>
<P>
   STRATFORD, Conn. (AP) - Several motorists had to be rescued from
their vehicles and numerous properties were damaged after a storm
dumped nearly 8 inches of rain in Fairfield county early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   No fatalities or serious injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   A Stratford town police cruiser and three ambulances were
heavily damaged after being inundated with flood water, Town
Manager Mark Barnhart said. One of the ambulances stalled in high
water while carrying patients, who were transferred to another
ambulance and brought to the hospital, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barnhart said several businesses in the town center were forced
to close Saturday because of flood damage. Officials said numerous
homeowners were cleaning out water from their basements.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of Natalie's Antiques on Main Street said they were
not sure if insurance would cover the tens of thousands of dollars
in damage done by the several feet of water inside their shop.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is all I've worked for,'' owner Natalie Fisher said.
''This is my retirement money.''
</P>
<P>
   State Transportation Department crews were called in to help
clear roads.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would appear that we took the brunt of the storm,''
Barnhart said. ''It was a freakish storm event. The force of the
water was quite awesome. I can't describe it. You have it picking
up large objects. An ambulance was swept sideways by the current.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnhart said the town is investigating whether a
recently-installed pump system, designed to prevent flooding, did
its job.
</P>
<P>
   Barnhart said several businesses do not have flood insurance. He
said town officials may seek state or federal aid to clean up the
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport authorities also reported rescuing motorists stranded
in their vehicles. No serious injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Low-lying parts of Stratford are prone to flooding, partly
because of viaducts near the Metro North rail line, Barnhart said.

<HEADLINE> FEMA Director Tours Fire Damage  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WICKES, Mont. (AP) -- The head of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency toured fire-blackened Montana landscape Saturday,
promising federal aid for local governments strapped by the expense
of fighting this summer's wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   A child's bicycle still smoldered in a field as FEMA Director
James Lee Witt visited this former mining camp. Flames had swept
through the small town earlier in the week, destroying an abandoned
post office and other buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials said they were encouraged by two days of cooler
temperatures that allowed crews to make progress against some of
the blazes that have made Montana a hot spot of firefighting
efforts across the West.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're hoping that the situation is past its crisis stage,''
said Jack Kendley, a fire information officer for two major blazes
burning south of Helena. ''I think we're in pretty good shape. ...
Our biggest danger would be spotting over the fire lines.''
</P>
<P>
   However, meteorologists forecast a return of hot, dry weather.
</P>
<P>
   There were still 69 notable fires burning in Arizona,
California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon,
Utah, Washington, and Wyoming, said the National Fire Information
Center in Boise, Idaho. They had charred a total of 923,000 acres,
the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire that swept through Wickes, combined with another fire
in the area, had burned close to 14,000 acres and forced hundreds
of people to evacuate. The two fires were about 85 percent
contained Saturday morning and some 900 firefighters remained on
the line.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, 19 major fires were active in Montana on Saturday and
officials estimated more than 352,000 acres of the state had
burned.
</P>
<P>
   State Disaster and Emergency Services Division officials
estimated that 2,439 houses were threatened by fires around the
state, including more than 1,900 in the Bitterroot Valley south of
Missoula. The fires that began in late July have destroyed 166
buildings, including more than 50 homes.

<P>
   Meeting with local volunteer firefighters, Witt said Montana's
fires were so bad that FEMA would pay for 100 percent of eligible
state and local firefighting costs, with 50 percent now.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's get it done,'' said Sen. Max Baucus. ''We shouldn't have
to have the Is dotted and the Ts crossed to get the money that is
needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Marc Racicot said the FEMA money means he won't have to
consider calling a special Legislative session to get additional
funding to fight the fires.
</P>
<P>
   State, local and federal fighting costs have topped $62 million
in Montana and there were 6,154 firefighters at work Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bitterroot Valley, wind had eased enough to let
firefighters protect homes and dig new lines along a number of
blazes.
</P>
<P>
   Near the valley town of Pinesdale, where 500 people have been
evacuated since last week, five miles of bulldozer line and two
miles of hand-dug fire line were in place Saturday around one
8,000-acre fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's looking good,'' said Carey Jones, a fire information
officer.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said officials had no immediate plans to lift the
evacuation order and cautioned that the area was not out of danger.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the West, Nevada's largest fire, about 25 miles
southeast of Jackpot in the state's northeastern corner, was 95
percent contained at 39,700 acres. But two other remote blazes
continued to grow, including a 21,000-acre fire that had been
largely untended for over a week.
</P>
<P>
   Pack trains of horses were hauling water to crews in remote
areas and in the Jarbidge Wilderness where motorized vehicles are
forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 3,700 firefighters were battling fires in Idaho, roughly
half of them on a blaze near the Montana state line that had spread
through 127,000 acres and was only 40 percent contained Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A range fire near Hazelton, Idaho, was contained within only 24
hours after burning 20,000 acres, but it killed 150 cattle.
</P>
<P>
   A firefighter was killed Friday when wind-driven flames swept
over a fire truck on the Wind River Reservation near Thermopolis,
Wyo. Another firefighter died Aug. 6 when a helicopter crashed
battling fires in Nevada. Five other firefighters, from Arizona,
Florida, South Dakota and two from Texas, also have died fighting
wildfires this year.

<HEADLINE> Giants Coach Fassel Still Upbeat  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Despite being winless in the preseason and
giving away a game to Jacksonville with a last-second blunder, Jim
Fassel isn't overly concerned about the New York Giants three weeks
before the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   The positives far outweigh the negatives, almost to the point
that rookie linebacker Jack Golden's now infamous tackling of a
teammate to set up Jacksonville's game-winning touchdown on Friday
night seems insignificant.
</P>
<P>
   A little less than 24 hours after the 16-13 loss to the Jaguars,
Fassel said Saturday night that the play of his starting offense
and defense has been very good so far.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Kerry Collins continued to look good, completing 10
of 19 passes for 110 yards. Receiver Amani Toomer came up with a
big touchdown catch and the defense limited Jacksonville's offense
to three field goals.
</P>
<P>
   ''All in all, we made a lot of improvement in a lot of areas,''
Fassel said. ''That's the way I approached the team afterwards.''
</P>
<P>
   So instead of screaming about the loss on Friday night, Fassel
didn't get down on his team.
</P>
<P>
   ''We went down there with an attitude to win,'' Fassel said.
''It was important for us to win that ballgame. We fought hard, but
when you lose a game like that, it can rip your heart out in a
preseason game. It can turn you in the wrong direction mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   While there were a lot of long faces in the locker room, Fassel
told them that all the mistakes they made were correctable,
including the two on the game-winning touchdown that started when
Fred Lewis intercepted a Jonathan Lewis' pass around the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of falling down in the end zone, Lewis started to come
out and Golden tackled him, causing a fumble that Jaguars tight end
Brandon Christenson recovered for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got a list of 11 things that, in my opinion, led directly
to us losing that game,'' Fassel said. ''I would say four, five or
six of them, if we eliminate just those, we win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis should have fallen to the ground immediately after the
interception, Fassel said.
</P>
<P>
   The tackle was inexcusable.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is what you learned in high school, which is crazy, don't
ever tackle the guy, don't ever tackle the guy,'' Fassel said.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel didn't go through all 11 mistakes, but he said the Giants
twice ran out of the bounds when they could have kept the clock
running in the closing minutes. He added on the game-winning drive,
the defense blew a pass coverage on fourth-and-17.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did everything we could to win that game and then we did
everything wrong to give it back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Fassel was reminded that most of the mistakes were made by
second and third team players who won't be playing when the Giants
open against Arizona on Sept. 3, he said the mistakes still need to
be corrected.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of those rookie might be playing for us,'' Fassel said.
''They have to grow up pretty quick because they (the games) are
going to be counting pretty quick. That's our job to hammer at them
so we get it straightened out by the time we play Arizona.''

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An activist dressed in a pink pig costume dumped four
tons of animal manure from a truck today in front of a hotel housing guests
attending the Democratic National Convention. Police arrested the animal rights
activist and impounded the truck. Elsewhere, anti-abortion activists and

Milosevic Moves Worry U.S.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is worried that Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic may be preparing stir up new problems in the
Balkans with a move against Montenegro. Only 14 months ago, NATO airstrikes
drove Serb forces out of Kosovo to end the Milosevic's crackdown on ethnic
Albanians in the Serbian province. Montenegro, Serbia's junior partner in the
Yugoslav federation, is seen as a potential target because it has a pro-Western
government whose leaders have made no secret of a desire for independence. The
United States is warning Milosevic to let the republic live in peace.

   LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland (AP) -- More than 20,000 Protestants filled the
streets of Londonderry Saturday with British flags and banners declaring ''No
Surrender'' -- a defiant demonstration made possible by a deal with leaders of
this mostly Catholic city. Amid the clamor, there were hopeful signs that common
sense can prevail in Northern Ireland after years of march-fueled violence. Most
Catholics stayed at home or went shopping in nearby malls as the Apprentice Boys
brotherhood, a historic symbol of Protestant dominance, commemorated the days
when Protestants controlled this 17th-century fortress city.

governments strapped by the expense of fighting this summer's wildfires. A
child's bicycle still smoldered in a field as FEMA Director James Lee Witt
visited this former mining camp. Flames had swept through the small town earlier
in the week, destroying an abandoned post office and other buildings. Fire
officials said they were encouraged by two days of cooler temperatures that
allowed crews to make progress against some of the blazes that have made Montana

<P>
	   WATKINS GLEN, N.Y. (AP) - Friends and family gathered to bury a
slain teen-ager, hoping to ''find comfort'' amid the pain and
anguish of the girl's death and the arrest of her 16-year-old
friend.
</P>
<P>
   The body of Amber J. Brockway, a 15-year-old honor student who
would have entered her junior year, was found Monday morning in an
abandoned building near Seneca Lake. Her schoolmate and friend,
Joshua J. Horein, remained in the Schuyler County Jail, accused of
second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   Brockway was killed by several blows to the head.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Beverly Karr-Lyon, pastor at the First Presbyterian
Church, led hundreds of mourners in an emotional service Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We come together today to find comfort in the midst of so many
unanswered questions and such a painful loss,'' Karr-Lyon said in
her eulogy. ''A large part of life is the struggle against every
person's own smallness and fear and anger. May we look inward and
pray for forgiveness of thoughts of anger we have had, and let go
of our fears and our rage in order to minimize the chance that
something like this will happen again.'' The eulogy followed an
emotional song called ''Now You're Gone,'' performed by Michael
Fredo, a local pop singer whom Amber admired.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Amber's cousins told the gathering how she always had
time to listen and give comfort, had a cheerful spirit, a ready
smile and a concern for friends.

<HEADLINE> N.J. Storm Dumps 10 Inches of Rain  </HEADLINE>
By HANAH CHO
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPARTA, N.J. (AP) -- As much as a foot of rain fell in parts of
the Northeast on Saturday, turning creeks into rivers, flooding
roads, business and homes and collapsing at least two bridges in
northern New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Flash flood watches were posted for much of New Jersey and parts
of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, New York and Connecticut, the
National Weather Service said.
</P>
<P>
   A state of emergency was declared in Sparta, where eight to 10
inches of rain fell in just a few hours. Residents had to be
evacuated from homes there and in nearby Ogdensburg and Lake
Hopatcong, and police were scrambling to answer calls about people
stranded on submerged cars and in homes in flooded neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The National Guard sent trucks and troops to help emergency
officials reach flooded areas. Bridges in Jefferson Township and in
Ogdensburg had collapsed, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10,000 lost power in the region, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In Narrowsburg, N.Y., the 15-member volunteer fire department
performed its first water rescue, reaching a woman whose house was
cut off by rising waters.
</P>
<P>
   ''A woman was apparently struck by lightning,'' said Assistant
Chief Michael Hector. ''The road going to her house was flooded
over so we had to take a small rescue boat over a swollen creek ...
carry her out on a backboard, and bring her back on the boat to the
ambulance.''
</P>
<P>
   The creek is usually so small it doesn't even have a name, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service said as much as six inches of rain
fell in surrounding Sullivan County, about 60 miles northwest of
New York City. Other fire departments in the area were busy
barricading roads closed by flooding and mudslides.
</P>
<P>
   On Max Yasgur's farm, of 1969 Woodstock fame, car after car
headed to a political rally dubbed ''Greenstock'' on Saturday got
bogged down in the thick mud.
</P>
<P>
   A police car and three ambulance were caught in flash flooding
in Stratford, Conn., where 8 inches of rain fell Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a freakish storm,'' said Town Manager Mark Barnhart
said. ''The force of the water was quite awesome. I can't describe
it. You have it picking up large objects. An ambulance was swept
sideways by the current.''
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners and business-owners bailed floodwater from their
homes and stores, Saturday while officials investigated whether a
recently-installed pump system designed to prevent flooding had
done its job.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of Natalie's Antiques on Main Street said they
weren't sure if insurance would cover the tens of thousands of
dollars in damage done by several feet of water in their shop.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is all I've worked for,'' owner Natalie Fisher said.
''This is my retirement money.''

<HEADLINE> Democratic Convention Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- President Clinton commanded the Democrats'
convention-city spotlight Saturday, mingling with celebrities and
supporters while his understudy struck an environmental theme on a
distant campaign trail. ''We're going to win this election,''
declared Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' transition unfolded as delegates flocked to a
city bracing for protests alongside the parties and politics.
Police recorded their first arrest, taking into custody an animal
activist dressed in a pink pig costume who dumped a truckload of
manure onto a downtown street.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton, in town as Senate candidate from New York,
neatly summed up the business at hand. ''We are here to do
everything we can to highlight the Clinton-Gore administration and
to promote the Gore-Lieberman administration,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day convention starts Monday, with Clinton's
valedictory speech the opening night highlight. Caroline Kennedy
was making her most visible public appearance on Tuesday and on
Wednesday, Lieberman was making his prime-time speaking debut --
setting the stage for Thursday's finale when Gore will accept his
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ''My speech on Thursday night is going to focus on the future
and the whole convention is going to be on substance, not a big
show,'' Gore told reporters in a none too subtle dig at George W.
Bush's tightly scripted Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials hope the Democratic program will boost Gore's
popularity and help wipe out Bush's lead in the polls. Gore trails
Bush by 10 points, 48 percent to 38 percent, in a Newsweek poll of
registered voters released Saturday, roughly the same margin as
reported by CBS and ABC polls released the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton arrived on the West Coast on Friday and plunged into a
schedule packed with fund-raising events for his presidential
library, his wife's campaign and his party.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday evening's fund-raiser featured a large cast of
Hollywood figures, from Red Buttons to Whoopi Goldberg, and was
expected to yield $1 million for the First Lady's Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaigned in Pennsylvania, stressing his commitment to the
environment by visiting the homestead of Rachel Carson. Her 1962
book, ''Silent Spring'' was a seminal moment in the rise of the
modern-day environmental movement, and Gore said his mother had
given him a copy when he was a boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a major lesson for me,'' he said, adding that many of
the same groups that attacked Carson for her views were now
berating him.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was the target of a very well financed attack,'' Gore told
about 200 supporters gathered on a hillside. ''We've seen some of
the same things.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaigned while Lieberman observed Sabbath, taking a
24-hour break from political activity and attending weekly services
at his Orthodox synagogue in Washington D.C. In keeping with
tradition, he donned a skull cap and prayer shawl before entering
the service. Also in observance of religious ritual, he and wife
Hadassah sat in different sections of the synagogue, since Orthodox
Judaism requires men and women to worship apart.
</P>
<P>
   Southern California was the scene of unusual political ferment.
</P>
<P>
   In Long Beach, the Reform Party was split in two, a shadow of
the political force that played such a key role in the last two
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan and John Hagelin both claimed the party's
nomination for president, and a legal battle loomed over the
party's $12.5 million allotment of campaign funds. ''Let me admit
it: if the establishment is able to deny us the little amount of
money we get, and we get a media blackout so that I'm not covered,
and then they keep us out of the debate, yes, they can make it
impossible to win,'' Buchanan said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Perot was the Reform Party candidate in 1992 and 1996, and
each time, he siphoned off votes that Republicans could have used
in their battles with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, the third-party threat loomed larger against
the Democrats, with Ralph Nader threatening to siphon off voters in
key states Gore must win to hold the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're seeing Nader bumper stickers already,'' said Mark
Pocan, a delegate from Wisconsin who said he wished the Gore
campaign was paying closer attention to the challenge from the
longtime consumer activist.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm always afraid when they don't pay enough attention to the
Nader factor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, anti-abortion activists were among the early
protesters, carrying poster-sized pictures of aborted fetuses
around the perimeter of the heavily secured convention site.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of U.S. immigration policies set up 553 white crosses
in a church parking lot to mark the deaths of those known to have
died crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   No violence was reported -- but no one was taking any chances.
</P>
<P>
   A security fence topped with razor wire was thrown up around a
hotel across the street from the convention site and near an
approved area for protests.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby businesses were paying top dollar for private security
guards. ''We are charging more, not just because there is a demand
but also because of the level of threat,'' said Richard F. Moreno,
president of one firm, American Asset Protection.

<HEADLINE> Northeast Storm Dumps Foot of Rain  </HEADLINE>
By HANAH CHO
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPARTA, N.J. (AP) -- As much as a foot of rain fell in parts of
the Northeast on Saturday, turning creeks into rivers, flooding
roads, business and homes and collapsing at least two bridges in
northern New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Flash flood watches were posted for much of New Jersey and parts
of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, New York and Connecticut, the
National Weather Service said.
</P>
<P>
   A state of emergency was declared in Sparta, where eight to 10
inches of rain fell in just a few hours. Residents had to be
evacuated from homes there and in nearby Ogdensburg and Lake
Hopatcong, and police were scrambling to answer calls about people
stranded on submerged cars and in homes in flooded neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The National Guard sent trucks and troops to help emergency
officials reach flooded areas. Bridges in Jefferson Township and in
Ogdensburg had collapsed, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10,000 lost power in the region, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In Narrowsburg, N.Y., the 15-member volunteer fire department
performed its first water rescue, reaching a woman whose house was
cut off by rising waters.
</P>
<P>
   ''A woman was apparently struck by lightning,'' said Assistant
Chief Michael Hector. ''The road going to her house was flooded
over so we had to take a small rescue boat over a swollen creek ...
carry her out on a backboard, and bring her back on the boat to the
ambulance.''
</P>
<P>
   The creek is usually so small it doesn't even have a name, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service said as much as six inches of rain
fell in surrounding Sullivan County, about 60 miles northwest of
New York City. Other fire departments in the area were busy
barricading roads closed by flooding and mudslides.
</P>
<P>
   On Max Yasgur's farm, of 1969 Woodstock fame, car after car
headed to a political rally dubbed ''Greenstock'' on Saturday got
bogged down in the thick mud.
</P>
<P>
   A police car and three ambulance were caught in flash flooding
in Stratford, Conn., where 8 inches of rain fell Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a freakish storm,'' said Town Manager Mark Barnhart
said. ''The force of the water was quite awesome. I can't describe
it. You have it picking up large objects. An ambulance was swept
sideways by the current.''
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners and business-owners bailed floodwater from their
homes and stores, Saturday while officials investigated whether a
recently-installed pump system designed to prevent flooding had
done its job.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of Natalie's Antiques on Main Street said they
weren't sure if insurance would cover the tens of thousands of
dollars in damage done by several feet of water in their shop.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is all I've worked for,'' owner Natalie Fisher said.
''This is my retirement money.''

Verizon, Unions Try To Forge Deal
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Verizon Communications and two telephone unions wrestled
over required overtime and job security today as they sought to reach a contract
that would end a week-old strike in Eastern states. Communications Workers of
America, the larger of the two striking unions, reported little progress this
afternoon on points it said were most critical to its members: forced overtime,
the shifting of work to cheaper areas and what the unions call oppressively
stressful conditions for customer service representatives. However, talks
continued well into the night and there was no indication how late bargainers
would work.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is worried that Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic may be preparing stir up new problems in the
Balkans with a move against Montenegro. Only 14 months ago, NATO airstrikes
drove Serb forces out of Kosovo to end Milosevic's crackdown on ethnic Albanians
in the Serbian province. Montenegro, Serbia's junior partner in the Yugoslav
federation, is seen as a potential target because it has a pro-Western
government whose leaders have made no secret of a desire for independence.

professed segregationist in the early years, but Selma kept re-electing him.
Now, Smitherman is counting on black voters -- 65 percent of the city's
electorate -- to win his 10th consecutive term in office. Three black candidates
are also on the Aug. 22 ballot, and Smitherman's staunchest opponents have

<HEADLINE> Connecticut Post reporter dead at 56  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) - James G. Clark, a Connecticut Post
reporter and columnist who covered everything from food to politics
during his more than 30-year career, died Friday at St. Vincent's
Medical Center. He was 56.
</P>
<P>
   Clark had suffered from cirrhosis of the liver and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jim was a very talented writer who knew Bridgeport inside and
out. His presence in this city, along with his writings, will be
missed,'' said Robert H. Laska, president and CEO of the Thomson
Newspapers' Southern Connecticut Strategic Marketing Group, which
publishes the Post.
</P>
<P>
   Clark started his career in 1963 in Stamford with The Advocate.
He began work for the Bridgeport Telegram in 1969, reporting on
Bridgeport City Hall and the General Assembly in Hartford. He also
wrote Dining Out, a restaurant review column; the Produce Basket
column, which featured tips about buying and preparing fruits and
vegetables; and various features.
</P>
<P>
   The Telegram merged with the Bridgeport Post in 1992 to become
the Connecticut Post.
</P>
<P>
   Clark was a former Connecticut Society of Professional
Journalists president, treasurer, secretary and longtime member of
its board of directors. A scholarship in his memory is being
established by the Connecticut SPJ Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Clark was born in Monongahela, Pa., and lived in Stamford for 25
years before moving to Bridgeport in 1977. A graduate of Stamford
High School, he received a bachelor of arts degree from the
University of Connecticut in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his mother, Virginia M. Clark, of Delray
Beach, Fla.; two brothers, Lewis W. Clark, of Norwalk, and Robert
R. Clark, of Marlborough, Mass.; a sister, Carol V. Clark, of
Houston, Texas; and several nieces and nephews.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service will be held Tuesday at 2 p.m. at Golden Hill
United Methodist Church.

   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Adolfo Valencia scored his second
goal of the game in the 93rd minute to give the New York-New Jersey
MetroStars a 2-1 victory over New England on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Valencia tied it in the 88th minute to help the Eastern
Conference-leading MetroStars (14-9-2) snap a two-game losing
streak. New England dropped to 9-11-6.
</P>
<P>
   Valencia scored in overtime after Clint Mathis' shot was knocked
over the endline by the New England defense. On the corner kick by
Mathis, Valencia went high into the air to head the ball into the
net. It was Valencia's 13th goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared New England would walk away with the victory when
Wolde Harris tallied his fifth goal in as many matches after
Mauricio Wright's header on a corner kick in the 87th minute.
</P>
<P>
   But the MetroStars fought back to even the match just a minute
later when Mathis took a pass from Lothar Matthaus and headed it to
Valencia at the right post. Mathis, the MetroStars' second leading
scorer, did not start because of a sore ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Harris just missed on a chance to win it in injury time when his
hard shot missed the right post by inches.
</P>
<P>
   Matthaus returned the MetroStars after missing six weeks with
injuries and commitments to the German national team.

<HEADLINE> Pirates 9, Diamondbacks 6  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Kevin Young's infield single turned into two
runs as third baseman Matt Williams threw wildly in the seventh
inning, ending Pittsburgh's six-game losing streak against Curt
Schilling and rallying the Pirates past Arizona 9-6 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Aramis Ramirez hit a grand slam in the eighth off reliever
Johnny Ruffin and drove in five runs as the Pirates won for only
the third time in 11 games. Arizona has lost eight of 13.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling (9-7) had been 3-0 since the trade to Arizona and was
9-1 in his last 10 starts against the Pirates before allowing five
runs and eight hits in seven innings. His last previous loss to
Pittsburgh was on July 21, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Bell's two-run homer off reliever Rich Loiselle gave Arizona
a 4-3 lead, but Schilling -- who allowed only three earned runs in
26 innings in his first three Diamondbacks starts -- immediately
lost it.
</P>
<P>
   Aramis Ramirez doubled down the left field line and Alex Ramirez
singled a batter later, then stole second.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who entered in a double switch in the top of the seventh,
hit a hard grounder that Williams stopped by diving to his left.
Williams scrambled to his feet and appeared to have a play on Young
at first, but his throw sailed wide of the bag as both runners
scored. Young was credited with one RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Young had been 1-for-21 in his career against Schilling, going
hitless in his previous 18 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Sauerbeck (5-1) pitched 1 1-3 scoreless innings for the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Gonzalez and Matt Williams hit ninth-inning homers off Mike
Williams. Gonzalez homered for the second straight night, hitting
his 26th of the season; Matt Williams stopped an 0-for-12 slide
with just his fifth homer.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona quickly opened a 1-0 lead in the first as Tony Womack,
Bell and Gonzalez singled in succession against Todd Ritchie, who
came off the disabled list to make his first start since losing 4-1
to Schilling on July 23. That was Schilling's last start for the
Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   Damian Miller doubled in the second and scored on Schilling's
perfectly executed squeeze bunt to make it 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   But Schilling couldn't hold that lead, either, as Jason Kendall
hit a two-run homer, his 10th, in a three-run fifth and Aramis
Ramirez followed Brian Giles' triple with an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie lasted five innings, giving up two runs and seven hits.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Two of Ramirez's six homers this season are grand slams. He
also hit one July 28 against San Diego. ... The Pirates' two homers
stopped a streak of five games without a homer. ... Womack stole
second in each of the first two innings, giving him 13 stolen bases
in 10 games. ... Gonzalez has six of Arizona's last 11 homers. ...
Pirates pinch-hitters are 5-for-33 since July 1 and have two RBIs
in 53 games -- Aramis Ramirez's two-run double June 30 at
Philadelphia. ... Arizona lost for only the second time in nine
games at Three Rivers Stadium. ... The Diamondbacks had been 6-1
overall against the Pirates this season.

<HEADLINE> 15-Year-Old Makes US Swim Team  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- With Tom Malchow leading the way,
15-year-old Michael Phelps became the youngest male swimmer in 68
years to earn a spot on the U.S. Olympic team Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Malchow was on pace to break his own world record in the
200-meter butterfly before fading badly in the final 50 meters. He
still got on the Olympic team with a winning time of 1 minute,
56.87 seconds -- 1.69 off the mark he set June 17 in Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got my ticket to Sydney,'' Malchow said. ''Now, the battle
begins. If I didn't make the team, that might have been my
career.''
</P>
<P>
   Closing fast, Phelps touched at 1:57.48 to earn the second
Olympic berth. He becomes the youngest member of the men's team
since 13-year-old Ralph Flanagan, who competed in the 1932 Los
Angeles Games.
</P>
<P>
   ''Phelps is awesome,'' said Malchow, 23, of Ann Arbor, Mich. ''I
might have retired a little sooner with someone like that coming
up. He didn't get caught up in the hype, which is a credit to him.
He stuck to his game plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Phelps, a native of Baltimore who turned 15 on June 30, actually
made the team with ease, cruising away from Jeff Somensatto
(1:58.07).
</P>
<P>
   ''He doesn't know what it means to go to the Olympics and how
it's going to change his life,'' said Malchow, a silver medalist
and youngest man on the American team in 1996. ''He's going to find
out soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most teen-agers, Phelps enjoys listening to music, playing
video games and hanging out with friends. News conferences are not
a normal part of his routine -- he seemed overwhelmed at the first
one of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought I saw second next to my name,'' he said. ''I wasn't
sure, so I had to take my goggles off to check it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Cristina Teuscher of New York, who won gold in the Atlanta Games
on a relay, dominated the women's 200 individual medley, reaching
the finish in 2:13.36 to beat runner-up Gabrielle Rose (2:14.95) by
nearly two seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Rose made her second straight Olympic team -- with two different
countries. She represented Brazil in 1996 but is now an American
citizen living in Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay Benko of Los Angeles captured the night's other final,
the women's 200 freestyle. She swam 2:00.45 to edge Rada Owen of
Chesterfield, Va., who claimed the second spot at 2:00.54 over a
fading Samantha Arsenault of Peabody, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't my best time, but I got my hand on the wall first,''
the 23-year-old Benko said. ''I wish everybody could feel what I'm
feeling now. I've been swimming for 17 years and I couldn't imagine
what my life would be like without it.''
</P>
<P>
   Arsenault, who had the fastest time Friday in both the
preliminaries and semifinals, had her slowest time (2:00.79) of
those three races. She will still go to Sydney for the relay.
</P>
<P>
   Malchow's trip to the Olympics seemed a formality; the sellout
crowd at the Indiana University Natatorium wanted a world record.
Malchow was nearly a half-second under the pace as he made the
final turn, but he couldn't sustain it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody was expecting to see a world record. I was trying to
provide one, but I got a little too caught up in it,'' he said.
''At times, it's a lot hanging on my head. I put myself in position
where a lot was expected of me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Phelps family, meanwhile, is used to accomplishing big
things at a young age. Sister Whitney was only 14 when she made the
American team for the 1994 world championships. Two years later,
she failed to qualify for the Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Whitney is on hand to cheer for her brother, who has
grown 4 inches since January to 6-3. She was one of the first
people to hug Phelps after he left the water.
</P>
<P>
   Free spirit Gary Hall Jr. displayed the form that won two silver
medals in the 1996 Games. Since then, his life has been in turmoil
-- a suspension after testing positive for marijuana, then learning
in March 1999 that he has diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's constantly in the back of my mind,'' said Hall, who has
to give himself up to eight insulin injections a day. ''But it's
also a motivating factor. I want to stay in shape and try to avoid
any complications''
</P>
<P>
   Hall, of Phoenix, was second-fastest in both the preliminaries
and semifinals of the 100 freestyle, with a time of 48.92 Saturday
night. Neil Walker of Austin, Texas goes into the eight-man final
Sunday as the top qualifier, 48.55.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gary was fantastic,'' said Sabir Muhammad of Atlanta, who
qualified eighth in his bid to become the first black to make a
U.S. swim team. ''It's good to see he's back swimming fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall's training has been hampered by his disease. He didn't even
have a trials qualifying time until a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''It gives me a taste of mortality,'' he said. ''It's kind of
difficult when I stand on the (starting) block. I like to have that
feeling of invincibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall, who plays guitar, restores old minibuses, listens to the
Grateful Dead, and loves to challenge the swimming establishment,
finished second to Russia's Alexander Popov in both the 50 and 100
freestyle in the 1996 Games.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1998, Hall was suspended by the FINA, the world's
governing body, following a positive marijuana test. Ten months
later, he received even worse news.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody goes through changes. Everybody has to face
challenges,'' he said. ''I had to accept my health or fold. Well, I
was never one to fold before. I don't plan to start now.''
</P>
<P>
   Misty Hyman of Phoenix was the fastest qualifier in the
semifinals of the women's 200 butterfly at 2:11.16. Ed Moses of
Burke, Va., moved on to the Sunday finals of the 200 breaststroke
after leading the semis at 2:13.13, a trials record.

<HEADLINE> 3 N.Y. Cops Shot in Standoff  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A gunman shot and wounded three police officers
in a seven-hour standoff at his Brooklyn home before he was fatally
shot by police Saturday night, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   One officer was listed in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff started after the man's parents told police their
son had purchased several weapons on Friday and had told them he
intended to ''shoot and kill police officers,'' Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   When the first officers arrived, the man, identified by police
as Albert Alalouf, opened fire with a shotgun, hitting officer
Gregory John in the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Police shot Alalouf several hours later after he surprised two
officers and shot one in the face and the other in the leg. Neither
officer's injury was considered life-threatening, Detective Joseph
Pentangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   Three other officers were being treated for injuries that were
not gunshot-related, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the bulletproof vest that John, 32, was wearing
had saved his life. At least eight holes were visible where
fragments had torn into the Kevlar vest.

<HEADLINE> Doctors Puzzled By Texas' Glynn  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Texas Rangers pitcher Ryan Glynn was
released from the hospital Saturday night, with doctors still
unclear as to why the rookie fainted in the dugout a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn underwent a battery of tests Friday night and Saturday to
determine why he lost consciousness a few minutes after he had been
removed from a game against Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn was examined by three doctors on Saturday -- Rangers
internist Dr. John Martin, a cardiologist and a neurologist. None
of the doctors was able to pinpoint the cause of Glynn's physical
problems and he hasn't been cleared to resume baseball activity.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers said Glynn was resting at home Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Play was suspended for 10 minutes during Friday night's game
while medical personnel attended to Glynn.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn had been taken out of the game with two out in the fifth
after the Red Sox scored four runs in the inning to stretch their
lead to 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   Gametime temperature was 98 degrees and Glynn had thrown 95
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the fifth, Rangers manager Johnny Oates called
for a paramedics cart to come to the dugout, where Glynn was lying
on ground.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn was down for about five minutes, but was fully conscious
and alert when he was taken by ambulance to Arlington Memorial
Hospital at about 9:15 p.m. CDT.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn, who gave up eight runs and seven hits over 4 2-3 innings
in a 7-3 loss to Boston, is scheduled to start on Tuesday night
against the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Oates said he won't be sure about his rotation until he knows
more about Glynn's availability.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not necessarily undecided,'' said Oates of Tuesday
night's starter. ''It's unknown.''

<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Welton and Roy Lassiter scored
goals a minute apart Saturday night as the Miami Fusion beat the
Colorado Rapids 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Miami was leading 2-1 when Welton scored on a rebound in the
82nd minute after Rapids goalkeeper David Kramer saved a shot by
Lassiter.
</P>
<P>
   Lassiter scored his sixth goal of the year less than a minute
later to close out the scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Rooney gave the Fusion (9-11-5) a 1-0 lead in the 37th
minute, sending a shot past Kramer from 15 yards out. Just three
minutes later, Andy Williams made it 2-0 when he put the ball in
the left side of the net, as Kramer was diving to the right.
</P>
<P>
   Marcelo Balboa cut the deficit to 2-1 in the 54th minute,
scoring past goalie Nick Rimando.
</P>
<P>
   The Fusion's four goals ties a franchise-record that was
accomplished four previous times. Miami swept the season series
with Colorado 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado (11-12-3) remained winless at Lockhart Stadium, the
only venue in the MLS in which the Rapids have not won.

<HEADLINE> Rockies 14, Expos 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Jeff Cirillo went 4-for-6 with a career-high
seven RBIs and Larry Walker had his fourth four-hit game of the
season to lead the Colorado Rockies over the Montreal Expos 14-2
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado, which on May 3 set a team record with 24 hits in a
16-7 rout of the Expos at Coors Field, had 22 hits off five
pitchers and has outscored the Expos 24-5 in consecutive games.
Overall, the Rockies have won four of five.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Hammonds also had four hits as the Rockies won
consecutive road games for just the fourth time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Masato Yoshii (5-12) allowed both runs and five hits in eight
innings, winning for the first time in eight starts since June 29.
Yoshii had lost his previous five decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Helton walked and singled in his first two plate
appearances to reach base safely for the 11th straight time. He had
an RBI grounder in the fifth, falling one short of Eric Young's
team record.
</P>
<P>
   Helton went 1-for-2, leaving his major league-leading average at
.387. He is 7-for-8 with five walks in the first three games of the
road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who hit a grand slam, doubled, and walked three times
Friday night, reached safely in each of his five plate appearances
to extend his streak to 10.
</P>
<P>
   Walker was hit by a pitch in the first, singled in the third and
again in the fifth. He hit an RBI double in the sixth and doubled
again in the seventh, tying his career best with his 25th career
four-hit game.
</P>
<P>
   Expos starter Trey Moore (1-2) allowed six runs and 11 hits in 4
2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Cirillo's two-run single and Neifi Perez's sixth homer in the
third put Colorado ahead 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Vidro's RBI double in the fourth cut the lead to 3-1, but
Colorado chased Moore in the fifth on Hammonds' RBI double,
Helton's run-scoring grounder and Cirillo's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal's Andy Tracy hit his sixth homer in the bottom half to
make it 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado scored four in the sixth off Felipe Lira to go ahead
10-2 and added four more in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Cirillo had six RBIs against San Francisco on June 28. ...
Young reached base safely 12 consecutive times from Sept. 19-24,
1993. ... The Rockies have won just four of their last 18 games
away from Coors Field. Colorado is 21-38 on the road. ... The
Rockies hadn't won consecutive road games since July 2-3. ... With
LHP Scott Downs placed on the 15-disabled list, Moore switched
spots in the rotation with Mike Thurman, who is to start Sunday.
... Tim Raines and Jim Fanning were inducted into the Expos' hall
of fame prior to the game. Raines made hit debut with Montreal in
1979 and was a NL All-Star in each of his first seven full seasons
with the Expos. Fanning was the team's first general manager and
led the Expos to their only postseason appearance in 1981 during
the first of his two stints as the team's manager.

<HEADLINE> Padres 2, Marlins 1, 10 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LONG
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Eric Owens blooped a single with two outs in the
10th inning to break a scoreless tie and send the San Diego Padres
past the Florida Marlins 2-1 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Desi Relaford singled off Antonio Alfonseca with one out in the
10th and moved to second on pinch-hitter John Mabry's hard-hit
ground ball to second, which Luis Castillo initially bobbled before
making the play.
</P>
<P>
   Owens fouled off seven pitches in a 12-pitch at-bat before his
pop fly landed just past the outstretched arm of first baseman
Derrek Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Darr followed with a double, scoring Owens for a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonseca (4-5) thought he had Relaford struck out with a
belt-high fastball before giving up the single. Alfonseca, who
leads the majors with 34 saves, also nearly struck out Owens, but
catcher Mike Redmond couldn't hold onto a foul tip with two
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Walker (5-0) pitched one inning for the victory. Trevor
Hoffman worked the 10th for his 32nd save, giving the Padres their
11th win in 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   Florida ended its shutout streak at 19 innings with a run in the
10th.
</P>
<P>
   With the bases loaded and no outs, pinch-hitter Mark Smith hit a
sacrifice fly. The threat ended when Castillo grounded back to
Hoffman and Mark Kotsay struck out with runners on second and
third.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins had a good chance to take the lead in the eighth
when pinch-hitter Andy Fox walked to lead off the inning, but
pitcher Reid Cornelius, pinch-hitting for starter Chuck Smith,
popped out trying to bunt.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres got another break when Castillo's ground ball kicked
off starter Matt Clement's foot and right to shortstop Relaford,
starting an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Smith got his sixth no-decision of the season after giving up
five hits in a career-high eight innings. He struck out seven and
walked two.
</P>
<P>
   Smith gave up two hits and two walks through the first six
batters he faced, but then he retired the next 12 Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Clement was equally impressive early. He sat down the first 10
Marlins he faced before Kotsay singled in the fourth for the
Marlins' first hit.
</P>
<P>
   Kotsay moved to second on Preston Wilson's single, and Clement
loaded the bases with a walk to Mike Lowell. But Lee grounded out
to end the inning and the scoring threat.
</P>
<P>
   Clement pitched eight strong innings, giving up two hits and
three walks. He struck out four in just his fourth no-decision in
25 starts.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Wilson struck out twice, giving him 148 this season and
leaving him 41 shy of Bobby Bonds' major league record set in 1970.
... Padres C Ben Davis missed the game with a strained muscle in
his left side and was listed as day-to-day. ... Phil Nevin improved
to 13-for-23 (.565) with five homers and 11 RBIs in seven games
against the Marlins this season.

<HEADLINE> Mayor Needs Black Vote in Selma  </HEADLINE>
By BOB JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SELMA, Ala. (AP) -- Joe Smitherman admits he was opposed to
blacks voting en masse when he was first elected mayor 36 years
ago. In fact, he was a professed segregationist in the early years,
but Selma kept re-electing him.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Smitherman is counting on black voters -- 65 percent of the
city's electorate -- to win his 10th consecutive term in office.
</P>
<P>
   Three black candidates are also on the Aug. 22 ballot, and
Smitherman's staunchest opponents have revved up a kick-him-out
campaign with signs planted across the city of 22,600 that read:
''Joe's Gotta Go.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My election is in the hands of the black citizens,''
Smitherman said. ''If they want change, that's in their hands
too.''
</P>
<P>
   For many Selma residents, Smitherman is the only mayor they have
ever known.
</P>
<P>
   He was first elected to the office in 1964, six months before
sheriff's deputies and state troopers armed with tear gas,
nightsticks and whips stopped hundreds of voting rights marchers on
Selma's Edmund Pettus Bridge in what became known as Bloody Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the electorate was mostly white, and Smitherman
could get away with segregationist guffaws. He once referred to the
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. as ''Martin Luther Coon,'' a slur he
later claimed was simply a verbal mistake.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past decade or so, Smitherman has worked for racial
accommodation.
</P>
<P>
   As blacks gained a majority in Selma, he successfully brought
voters into his camp, partly by helping black allies. He also
benefited in past elections against both black and white candidates
because whites voters were often unified behind him.
</P>
<P>
   But Smitherman's latest term has been marred by corruption in
city government. The former city clerk, police chief and two
contractors pleaded guilty to taking part in a phony invoice scheme
that stole $700,000 from the city.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been down this road long enough,'' said James Perkins, a
businessman trying for a third time to unseat Smitherman. In 1996,
Perkins lost to Smitherman by 364 votes out of 9,000 cast.
</P>
<P>
   Smitherman, now 70, shakes his head when asked about his
opponents' call for change.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why change? I've appointed nine blacks to city department
heads. Change to what? We've got the cheapest water rates in the
state. We've got back door garbage pickup. Just to change, that
would be a mistake,'' Smitherman said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the major civil rights organizations in Selma are
supporting Perkins. Longtime activist -- and a long-time thorn in
Smitherman's side -- Rose Sanders, says 36 years is long enough for
anyone to occupy the mayor's chair.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even if he had been a decent mayor, it would be time for him
to step aside,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders has been organizing volunteers to stand on Selma street
corners and distribute flyers while chanting ''Joe's Gotta Go.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is shocking that after all this time, the people in Selma
think it is all right that Joe Smitherman is still mayor,'' said
volunteer Susan Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Driving around Selma in his white Cadillac, Smitherman ventured
a guess that he would get most of the white vote and need about
1,000 black votes to stay in office.
</P>
<P>
   ''My problem is I have to get black votes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's other main opponent, City Council President Pro Tem
Yusuf Salaam, sees himself as a underdog who could surprise both
Smitherman and Perkins.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am David caught between two political machines. The success
of my campaign depends on reviving the aspirations of the freedom
fighters who came to Selma to redefine democracy in the 1960s,''
Salaam said.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth candidate, state Rep. Ed Maull, has conducted a low-key
campaign. Contacted at his home last week, he said he's tired of
talking about the election. ''Everything I say gets twisted, so I
have nothing to say,'' Maull said.
</P>
<P>
   The key to victory in the election may be which candidate can
round up the most absentee votes.
</P>
<P>
   Smitherman, who said absentee votes are a reality in Alabama
because many voters don't have transportation to get to the polls,
has several staff members monitoring the absentee votes. ''We do it
legally. We make staff members sign a statement that they will
offer nothing of value for absentee votes. We know we are being
watched,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Perkins said he believes the Smitherman campaign may be
using illegal tactics to get those votes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are real concerned,'' he said. ''There's a difference
between working the process hard and working it illegally.''
</P>
<P>
   One downtown businessman, Will Jackson, said it's still just
another election. Beyond liking or hating Smitherman, there isn't
much to bring people out to vote on Aug. 22, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one is pushing the issues that would motivate people to go
to the polls,'' Jackson said. ''I do get the feeling people want a
change, but people want a positive change.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Minnesota rookie Mark Redman pitched six
strong innings and Torii Hunter hit a two-run homer as the Twins
beat the Toronto Blue Jays 6-3 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Redman (11-5) allowed one run, six hits, struck out three and
walked one for the Twins, who have won six of their last 10.
</P>
<P>
   The left-hander, who leads AL rookies in victories, ERA (4.43),
strikeouts (99) and innings pitched (126), was in trouble just once
-- in the second inning -- when Toronto got three of its hits and its
only run off Redman.
</P>
<P>
   LaTroy Hawkins pitched two innings and struck out four of six
batters to earn his eighth save in as many chances.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, recalled from Triple-A Salt Lake City on July 29 to
shore up Minnesota's outfield, hit an 0-2 pitch from Toronto
starter Esteban Loaiza (6-9) over the right--field wall in the third
with one on to give the Twins a 5-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, who had three hits and is 17-for-37 (.459) in his last
10, also made up for a dropped ball in center field by throwing out
Tony Batista at the plate with a perfect throw to catcher Danny
Ardoin to end the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Grebeck went 3-for-4 with an RBI, and Shannon Stewart was
2-for-4 with a walk and an RBI for Toronto, which has lost 10 of
its last 12 road games.
</P>
<P>
   A throwing error by Toronto shortstop Alex Gonzalez led to two
unearned runs by the Twins in the first. Jay Canizaro reached base
on Gonzalez's low throw and scored from first on a double by Matt
Lawton.
</P>
<P>
   Lawton was caught in a rundown on a fielder's choice by Ron
Coomer, but Coomer took second on the play and scored on David
Ortiz's single.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto came back with a run in the second when Carlos Delgado
walked and scored one out later on consecutive singles by Todd
Greene, Dave Martinez and Grebeck.
</P>
<P>
   Canizaro drove in a run for the Twins in the second with a
two-out single to make it 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart added an RBI single for Toronto in the seventh off
reliever Joe Mays, who had been demoted to the Twins bullpen
earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Coomer's RBI single in the eighth made it 6-2. Gonzalez added an
RBI single in the ninth for Toronto's final run.
</P>
<P>
Notes: After going winless in its first five series against
Minnesota from 1977-81, Toronto is 15-3 since. ... Toronto is third
in the AL in fielding, but has made 17 errors in 30 games since the
All-Star break, including three tonight. ... Toronto is 7-10 since
Dave Stewart took over as pitching coach on July 25. ... Saturday's
game started 40 minutes late so that the Twins could introduce
their 40-year All-Time Team to the crowd of 30,161... C Chad
Moeller left after the first with a right knee injury. ... Hunter
is 6-for-7 against Loaiza in two games this year.

Iraq Criticizes S. Arabia, Kuwait
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- An allied airstrike hit a warehouse storing
humanitarian aid, killing two people, Iraqi officials said, prompting Baghdad to
accuse Saudi Arabia and Kuwait on Saturday of backing aggression. In Friday's
strike, U.S. and British planes struck in the city of Samawa, 168 miles south of
Baghdad, hitting the main food ration distribution center used to store food
allowed under the U.N. oil-for-food deal, Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh
told reporters. Along with two civilians killed, 19 others were injured, Iraqi
officials said.

Buchanan Claims Reform Nomination
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Pat Buchanan claimed the Reform Party nomination
today but said his long-shot presidential bid may have no chance if rivals
succeed in keeping him from the party's $12.5 million in federal funding.
Supporters of party founder Ross Perot say the nomination is John Hagelin's and
the money should be his. In a move that could render the federal subsidy less
crucial for him, Hagelin chose as his running mate an Internet multimillionaire.
No one is likely to see the federal cash until the issue is thrashed out by the
Federal Election Commission and then, probably, the courts.

Mau Mau Rebels Celebrate 50 Years

   NYERI, Kenya (AP) -- Aging rebels in shabby suits gathered in this central
Kenyan city Saturday to mark the 50th anniversary of their fight against British
colonial rule, sing old revolutionary songs and ask the government to finally
legalize their movement. The 250 men were veterans of the Mau Mau movement,
which was banned on Aug. 12, 1950, by British authorities, who considered it a
secret society that was a danger to the Kenya colony. Despite Kenya's
independence in 1963, the movement remains illegal and the men ignored by
successive Kenyan governments.

Mayor Needs Black Vote in Selma

   SELMA, Ala. (AP) -- Joe Smitherman admits he was opposed to blacks voting
''in mass'' when he was first elected mayor 36 years ago. In fact, he was a
professed segregationist in the early years, but Selma kept re-electing him.
Now, Smitherman is counting on black voters -- 65 percent of the city's
electorate -- to win his 10th consecutive term in office. Three black candidates
are also on the Aug. 22 ballot, and Smitherman's staunchest opponents have
revved up a kick-him-out campaign with signs planted across the city of 22,600
that read: ''Joe's Gotta Go.''

Taiwan President Stopping in L.A.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- An influential Asian leader is traveling to Los
Angeles on Sunday. He has promised he won't talk to reporters, hold public
events or meet with top U.S. officials. Chen Shui-bian's 16-hour layover will be
low key not because he's from a rogue state shunned by Washington. It's because
he's the president of Taiwan. Although Taiwan is a longtime friend of the United
States, a global trading power and a vibrant democracy, the island's leaders are
treated like pariahs on the rare occasions they are allowed to visit America.
The reason is China.	   China considers Taiwan a breakaway province that should
reunify with the mainland. The communist government in Beijing protests loudly
when other countries treat Taiwan as if it is an independent nation.

<HEADLINE> Lieberman, Family Break For Sabbath  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   As they do every Saturday, Joseph Lieberman and his family began
their day with a quiet walk to temple. But on this Sabbath day,
about 20 Secret Service agents walked behind them and two vans
filled with agents trailed as well.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, an Orthodox Jew, returned to his synagogue for the
first time since he was picked to be Al Gore's running mate. He is
the first Jew ever chosen for a national ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The senator from Connecticut entered Kesher Israel sanctuary in
Washington, D.C., wearing a prayer shawl over his shoulders and his
yarmulke, the traditional Jewish skullcap worn to cover the head in
reverence to God. He and his wife, Hadassah, sat separately, as all
men and women must do.
</P>
<P>
   The Torah portion read for this week's service included the Ten
Commandments; Rabbi Barry Freundel also spoke of ''Joe'' and his
''historic'' run for the vice presidency. He warned fellow
worshippers not to act ''triumphalistic,'' or feel that ''just
because he is one of ours ... that makes him better than anybody
else.'' Freundel advised the congregation -- a standing-room only
crowd in a synagogue that seats 320 -- to remain humble throughout
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a test case,'' Freundel said during a half-hour
sermon. ''We could squander this opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Freundel said Lieberman's run would be an opportunity for others
to learn about Orthodox Jews and see what Jewish people have to
contribute to society. He noted that the reaction of the American
public had generally been positive, aside from some hate group
discussions on the Internet and comments from an NAACP leader in
Dallas who was later dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Like other observant Jews -- Orthodox, Conservative or Reform --
the Liebermans began the Sabbath at sundown Friday.
</P>
<P>
   They had been out on the campaign trail. But while Gore
conducted press interviews, Lieberman's motorcade slipped away
without fanfare. The family boarded a train to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabbath is the traditional Jewish day of rest, a time to
pray and reflect on God's creations. It stems from the Torah, the
word of God, which says: ''For in six days, God made heaven, earth
and sea, and all that is in them, and He rested on the seventh day.
Therefore, God blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman has said he will not campaign on the Sabbath. The
senator believes he may still work during that time, but only to
promote ''the respect and protection of human life and
well-being.'' Jewish law, in fact, requires violation of the
Sabbath if doing so will save someone's life, his Rabbi Freundel
has said.
</P>
<P>
   Observant Jews like the Liebermans also keep kosher. It is
forbidden to eat certain animals like pig or shellfish. Meat cannot
be eaten with dairy products.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, while traveling with Gore aboard Air Force Two,
Lieberman has been served kosher meals. On the Wednesday flight out
of Nashville, for example, while most of those aboard the plane
were served barbecued pork ribs, Lieberman and his family were
offered vegetable lasagna.

<HEADLINE> Mets 3, Giants 2  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Benny Agbayani's gaffe cost the New York Mets
just a run, not the game.
</P>
<P>
   Agbayani allowed a run to score when he handed the ball to a
7-year-old fan in the stands when there were only two outs, but the
Mets rallied to beat the San Francisco Giants 3-2 on Todd Zeile's
two-run double in the seventh inning Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Down 1-0 in the fourth, the Giants loaded the bases with one out
and Bobby Estalella hit a lazy fly to left field. Agbayani ran
toward the line to make the catch.
</P>
<P>
   With Jeff Kent tagging from third and scoring, Agbayani jogged
toward the seats and handed the ball to Jake Burns, who broke into
a big smile.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was weird,'' the young fan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was eating a hot dog and then all of a sudden he had a ball
in his other hand,'' said his father, Jim.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Agbayani gave the ball away, another fan appeared to
shout that there were only two outs, but it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Jake Burns said he did not know how many outs there were when
the kooky play occurred, but his father did.
</P>
<P>
   ''I figured I was wrong. Then I saw his expression,'' he said,
referring to his son, ''and I couldn't care less.''
</P>
<P>
   Agbayani grabbed the ball back from the fan and threw it to the
infield, but the runners were given two extra bases on the error.
Ellis Burks, who reached on shortstop Mike Bordick's throwing
error, scored a second run on the play.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Walker, then with Montreal, made a similar slipup on April
24, 1994, when he handed a ball to a 9-year-old boy in the front
row at Dodger Stadium after catching a foul fly with one out and a
runner on first.
</P>
<P>
   After Agbayani warmed up in the top of the fifth, he directed
that the ball be given to the boy.
</P>
<P>
   That was the play of the game until the Mets rallied in the
seventh to win for the 15th time in 18 games.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Bubba Trammell led off with a walk -- the seventh
allowed by Giants starter Shawn Estes. Felix Rodriguez (4-2) came
in and got Bordick to pop out on a bunt attempt and struck out
Derek Bell.
</P>
<P>
   After Edgardo Alfonzo walked, Zeile lined a two-run double down
the right-field line to give the Mets the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hampton (12-7) was sharp for the Mets, allowing only two
unearned runs and five hits in seven innings to improve to 9-0
against San Francisco. He held the Giants hitless in 10 at-bats
with runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Benitez pitched the ninth for his 29th save in 33
chances. He struck out Barry Bonds looking with a runner on first
to end it.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants have lost two straight following a four-game winning
streak and remained two games ahead of Arizona in the NL West. The
Mets are still 2&AMP;frac12; games behind Atlanta in the NL East.
</P>
<P>
   In an odd game that was delayed 38 minutes by rain after the
second inning, the Mets were unable to score in the fifth when
Estes walked four of the first five batters in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton walked on four pitches to open the inning, but was
erased on Bordick's double-play grounder. Estes then threw 11
straight balls, walking Bell and Alfonzo and falling behind 3-0 to
Zeile, before walking him on a 3-1 pitch.
</P>
<P>
   That brought up Agbayani, who must have wished he had gotten the
day off. Agbayani, who went 0-for-4 with two strikeouts, grounded
out to short to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Bordick hit a solo homer in the third to give the Mets a 1-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Estes induced two double-play grounders, giving him a major
league-leading 30 this season. ... Alfonzo, who had eight multihit
games in his last nine contests, went 0-for-2.

<HEADLINE> Colts 17, Saints 0  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE HERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- Peyton Manning, who saw little
action in the first two games, passed for 106 yards and a touchdown
in the Indianapolis Colts' 17-0 victory over the New Orleans Saints
on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first Colts preseason shutout victory in 11 years,
and the Saints' first preseason shutout loss in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Edgerrin James, who did not play in a loss at Seattle last week,
rushed for 53 yards, including a 29-yard carry during the
second-quarter TD drive.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts (1-2), who also got two field goals by Mike
Vanderjagt, led 14-0 lead after three quarters, then stopped the
Saints (1-2) in the final period with interceptions by Mustafah
Muhammad, Patrick Sapp and David Macklin.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Kight added a 23-yard field goal with 5:54 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the first two preseason games, Manning played the entire
first half and was most effective in the second quarter when the
Colts scored the only touchdown of the game.
</P>
<P>
   James, who came in with only 5 yards rushing in the preseason,
carried five times late in the second period, including the 29-yard
gain to the Saints 40. After two more runs by James, Manning passed
16 yards to Terrence Wilkins at the 11.
</P>
<P>
   James then ran 3 yards and Manning passed to Chad Plummer, who
fell across the goal line for the touchdown with 26 seconds
remaining. A 2-point conversion run by James made it 14-0 at the
half.
</P>
<P>
   The first Indianapolis score was on a 34-yard field goal by
Vanderjagt in the opening period. Four straight completions by
Manning late in the first quarter and early in the second took
Indianapolis to the Saints 42. A personal foul on Fred Weary, who
tackled James out of bounds, put the Colts at the 27, and after
three straight incomplete passes, Vanderjagt kicked a 44-yard field
goal for a 6-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans, which gave up the ball on downs near midfield in
the first quarter, lost two chances to score in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   A 45-yard field-goal attempt by Doug Brien hit the left upright
midway through the quarter, and after Weary recovered a fumble by
James on the next series, the Saints again lost the ball on downs
at the Indianapolis 36.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Holcomb replaced Manning in the third quarter and took the
Colts to the New Orleans 30, where Kight missed a 48-yard
field-goal attempt. The recently signed Billy Joe Hobert, who
played the past two-plus years with the Saints, came in late in the
third quarter and took the Colts 33 yards following Muhammad's
interception to set up the final field goal by Kight.
</P>
<P>
   The shutout was the Colts' first in the preseason since they won
30-0 at Tampa Bay in 1989. The last preseason shutout loss for New
Orleans was 20-0 against Miami in 1980.

<HEADLINE> Mets' Agbayani Loses Track of Outs  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Catching a fly ball was easy for Benny Agbayani.
Figuring out what to do with it wasn't as simple as 1-2-3.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking it was the third out, the New York Mets left fielder
handed the ball to a 7-year-old boy Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Problem was, there were only two outs, the bases were loaded and
the ball was in live. The play came in the fourth inning and gave
San Francisco an extra run for a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was weird,'' said the young fan, Jake Burns.
</P>
<P>
   The gaffe did not cost the Mets the game, though, as they
rallied to beat the Giants 3-2.
</P>

Agbayani a nice ovation before he struck out in the bottom half.
</P>
<P>
   After Agbayani warmed up in the top of the fifth, he directed
that the ball be given to the boy.

<HEADLINE> Jet Passenger Attacks Cockpit, Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A 19-year-old passenger on a Southwest
Airlines flight tried to break into the cockpit, then died of an
apparent heart attack after being taken into custody, an airline
spokesman said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The man, on a flight from Las Vegas to Salt Lake City, was
pulled off the plane by airport security when the plane landed
Friday night, Southwest spokesman Ed Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   Officers at the Salt Lake City International Airport identified
the man as Jonathan Burton of Las Vegas and said he had suffered a
heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''The plane was about 20 minutes from landing and that's when
this gentleman did go into a rage and tried apparently to break
into the cockpit doors,'' Stewart said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Up until 20 minutes before the flight landed, everything was
fine,'' Stewart said. ''For all we know, he could have had a
seizure or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said crew members tried to restrain the man, but it took
half a dozen passengers to help hold him down.
</P>
<P>
   Airport duty manager Dennis Andersen said the man went into
cardiac arrest after being pulled off the plane by airport
security. He said no other information was immediately available,
except that the case had been handed over to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   No one else on board the plane, carrying 121 passengers and five
crew members, was reported injured.

<HEADLINE> Rangers 6, Red Sox 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Ricky Ledee hit a fourth-inning grand
slam to back Rick Helling and the Texas Rangers beat the Red Sox
6-3 Saturday night, Boston's fifth loss in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee homered in the fourth off Tim Wakefield (6-7), his second
career slam and 10th homer of the season, his first since Texas
acquired him from Cleveland on July 28. Ledee added a sacrifice fly
in the eighth for his fifth RBI, matching his career high.
</P>
<P>
   Helling (14-8) allowed one run and four hits in seven innings,
struck out five and walked three, improving to 7-1 in his last 10
starts.
</P>
<P>
   Gabe Kapler doubled in the second inning to stretch his hitting
streak to 25 games, a Rangers' record and the longest in the major
leagues this season.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's Tony Womack had a 24-game streak from May 2-29. Mickey
Rivers set the previous Rangers record in 1980 when he hit safely
in 24 straight games from Aug. 14-Sept. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler went for 3-for-3, doubling in the second, walking in the
fourth, hitting an RBI single in the fifth and another single in
the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   With the game scoreless, Wakefield lost his control in the
fourth inning and loaded the bases with walks to Rusty Greer,
Rafael Palmeiro and Kapler -- throwing 14 consecutive balls.
</P>
<P>
   When he rediscovered the strike zone, he threw a fat pitch to
Ledee, who hit it 420 feet into the right field seats.
</P>
<P>
   When Wakefield walked the next batter, Bill Haselman, he was
replaced by Bryce Florie.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield walked five and struck out two in three-plus innings,
allowing four runs and two hits.
</P>
<P>
   Boston got a run in the fifth on Manny Alexander's RBI single,
but Texas made it 5-1 in the fifth on Kapler's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Trot Nixon hit a two-run triple off John Wetteland in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Ledee's grand slam was the third by the Rangers this
season. ... Boston pitchers have given up five slams this year. ...
Rangers 2B Luis Alicea had a 38-game errorless streak snapped in
the sixth inning.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Claims Reform Nomination  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Pat Buchanan claimed the Reform Party
nomination Saturday and reached out to founder Ross Perot and his
supporters who are trying to prevent Buchanan from receiving $12.5
million in federal campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ross, let's go out and do battle together,'' Buchanan said in
a last-minute revision to his nomination acceptance speech. ''We're
giving (the party) the chance to grow and live. We've earned that
chance. Ross, come on out and give us a hand.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate indication that Perot or his supporters
would accept Buchanan's invitation. They say the nomination is John
Hagelin's and the money should be his. In a move that could render
the federal subsidy less crucial for him, Hagelin chose as his
running mate an Internet multimillionaire.
</P>
<P>
   No one is likely to see the federal cash until the issue is
thrashed out by the Federal Election Commission and then, probably,
the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The feisty conservative commentator and former Republican
acknowledged Saturday that his long-shot presidential bid may have
no chance if rivals succeed in keeping him from the party's $12.5
million in federal funding.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let me admit it,'' Buchanan said in an interview. ''If the
establishment is able to deny us the little amount of money we get,
and we get a media blackout so that I'm not covered, and then they
keep us out of the debate, yes, they can make it impossible to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Even then, Buchanan and his supporters believe they would have
won a key victory in his 40-year political career: Buchanan's own
political organization; no party elders to mind; and perhaps a role
in the general election representing voters unhappy with both the
Republicans and the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled opponents in other parties taunting: ''Don't worry
about those people; they have nowhere else to go,''' Buchanan told
some 600 delegates who voiced loud approval throughout his speech
Saturday night. ''Well, guess what? We've got somewhere else to go.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a home of our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Money or not, Buchanan remains a long shot, drawing 1 to 4
percentage points in recent national polls. But he contends that
for him the race is just beginning now that he has won the Reform
Party nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The key, he says, is achieving the 15 percent poll support
required to gain admittance to the presidential debates with Al
Gore and George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But that depends on a plan anchored in part by a modest radio
and television campaign to be paid for by the $12.5 million, said
the candidate's campaign manager and sister, Bay Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Even without that money, she said $1 million to $2 million in
donations would keep the campaign running and her brother on the
road five days a week.
</P>
<P>
   The separate convention that nominated Hagelin was still going
strong on Saturday, too, following the selection of Nat Goldhaber
as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin said his campaign would carry on whether or not he
received the federal funding.
</P>
<P>
   Goldhaber, who this month sold his Internet marketing company,
Cybergold, Inc., said he hadn't decided to spend his own money on
the campaign. ''I'll have to look into that,'' he said. He owns two
planes that he said he would use for campaign travel. He described
himself as worth ''less than hundreds of millions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the two major party nominees, the Reform candidate can
use private funds in addition to the $12.5 million in federal money
he can receive. He is still limited to spending no more than $67.6
million -- the federal money going to the Democratic and Republican
presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Like Vice President Al Gore's running mate, Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, Goldhaber is Jewish. Buchanan's running mate, Ezola
Foster, is a black woman.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin's supporters have filed a complaint with the FEC
charging that Buchanan fraudulently claimed the nomination and
asking that the federal funds be awarded to Hagelin instead.
</P>
<P>
   All year, Perot loyalists have expressed strong objections to
Buchanan's efforts to take over the party founded by the Texas
billionaire. They don't like the way Buchanan has gone about it,
replacing longstanding state party officials with his own, and they
don't like the way he emphasizes conservative social issues, an
approach they say is in direct contradiction to what most party
members want.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who left the Republican Party to run for the Reform
Party nomination, is not moved.
</P>
<P>
   During this past week, he has still been using the stark
language he favors: He will fight the ''rampant homosexuality''
that in part is causing the nation's cultural decline. Eradicating
abortion will be his top priority.
</P>
<P>
   ''Republicans may be running away from life, but as long as
there is life left in me I will never run away from the unborn,''
he said during his speech, to some of the loudest cheers of the
address. ''Because their cause is my cause and their cause is Gods
cause.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughs off the widely televised image of shoving, shouting
members of his adopted party, denying that it will hurt the
organization's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look, people forget these things in a week,'' he said. He
noted the violence outside the Democrats' 1968 convention in
Chicago and said, ''Compared to that, this is high tea at
Buckingham Palace.''

<HEADLINE> Barricaded man shoots three officers during Brooklyn incident  </HEADLINE>
AP Photos
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A gunman engaged in a standoff at his Brooklyn
home shot and wounded three city police officers before being
fatally shot by police Saturday night, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The almost seven-hour standoff with the gunman, identified as
Albert Alalouf, started Saturday afternoon after his parents had
earlier gone to the 61st Precinct in Brooklyn to report that
Alalouf had purchased several weapons on Friday, and then told them
he intended to ''shoot and kill police officers,'' Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   New York City cop Gregory John was among the first officers to
respond to Alalouf's residence in the Gravesend section of
Brooklyn, where the man opened fire with his shotgun. The officers
returned fire, forcing Alalouf back inside the home at 16 Parkway
Court, the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   John, 32, an Emergency Service Unit officer with 10 years on the
job, was rushed to Kings County Hospital in serious condition after
he was shot in the shoulder around 1:30 p.m., said Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Several hours later, Alalouf remained barricaded inside the home
as police circled the Brooklyn residence. But around 8 p.m.,
officers searching the perimeter of the home came across Alalouf,
who opened fire, police said.
</P>
<P>
   One officer was hit in the face and the other in the leg. They
were taken to Kings County Hospital, but their injuries were not
life-threatening, said Detective Joseph Pentangelo. Police did not
immediately identify the officers, but both were members of the
Emergency Service Unit.
</P>
<P>
   Officers fired back at Alalouf, and killed him. He was
pronounced dead at the scene, Pentangelo said. It was not clear
whether the two wounded officers fired back at Alalouf or if the
shots came from other officers on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Three other officers were being treated for injuries that were
not gunshot-related.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities credited John's bulletproof vest with saving his
life.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani displayed the officer's Kevlar vest, which contained at
least eight holes where the buckshot had torn into it.
</P>
<P>
   John was actually wearing two vests - his personal vest beneath
his uniform, and a heavier ESU vest worn over his clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank God for the vest,'' Giuliani said.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan President Stopping in L.A.  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- An influential Asian leader is traveling
to Los Angeles on Sunday. He has promised he won't talk to
reporters, hold public events or meet with top U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   His 16-hour layover will be low key not because he's from a
rogue state shunned by Washington. It's because he's the president
of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Although Taiwan is a longtime friend of the United States, a
global trading power and a vibrant democracy, the island's leaders
are treated like pariahs on the rare occasions they are allowed to
visit America. The reason is China.
</P>
<P>
   China considers Taiwan a breakaway province that should reunify
with the mainland. The communist government in Beijing protests
loudly when other countries treat Taiwan as if it is an independent
nation.
</P>
<P>
   China began complaining almost as soon as Taiwan's new
president, Chen Shui-bian, announced he would make a brief stop in
Los Angeles while traveling to Latin America, where several nations
have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   China's state-run Xinhua News Agency said the government felt
''strong resentment'' about the U.S. decision to give Chen a
transit visa. The report urged Washington ''to avoid severely
damaging bilateral relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing it safe, the U.S. State Department has discouraged
members of Congress from meeting with Chen during his layover.
</P>
<P>
   Chen on Saturday pulled out of a planned meeting with four
members of Congress from California, which was to be held in a
private home in Los Angeles Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I regret that the State Department and administration
officials have pressured President Chen to refrain from meeting
with Congress during his visit,'' Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., said
in a staff statement issued in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In Taipei on Sunday morning, Taiwanese Foreign Ministry official
Wu Tzu-dan would not specifically comment on the canceled meeting.
But Wu told reporters that Chen's schedule was tight and he did not
have time for such meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ''President Chen will spend most of his time in the hotel,''
said Wu, a vice minister. ''There's no time to do anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Taiwanese and American editorial writers have said
Washington should ignore Beijing and invite Chen to the White
House. Rather than lecture China about its human rights record,
America should show Chinese leaders that places like Taiwan which
have ditched authoritarianism for democracy get rewarded with red
carpet treatment, they argue.
</P>
<P>
   But such a move could be dangerous, because China, the world's
No. 3 nuclear power, appears to be deadly serious about Taiwan,
which split from the mainland during civil war 51 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When Washington allowed former Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui
to give a speech in 1995 at his alma mater, Cornell University, a
furious China responded by lobbing test missiles near Taiwan, which
is about 100 miles off the mainland's southeastern coast.
</P>
<P>
   Any rise in tensions between China and Taiwan creates serious
worries for the United States, Taiwan's most likely defender in the
event of a war. The U.S. government is required by law to sell
weapons to Taiwan that it needs for defense, and Washington sent
warships near the island when China held another round of missile
tests in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's first U.S. trip as Taiwan's president will be a challenge
for the 49-year-old former Taipei mayor, lawyer and democracy
activist, said Stephen Yates, a senior policy analyst who follows
Taiwan for the Heritage Foundation in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''How Chen handles this visit will leave a deep impression on
the Gore and Bush teams,'' Yates said, referring to the
presidential campaigns of Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov.
George W. Bush. ''If he does anything deemed too political or too
public, U.S. government attitudes could quickly turn against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his March election, Chen has tread lightly on the
potentially explosive China issue. He has assured Beijing he won't
declare independence as long as China doesn't attack, and he has
repeatedly invited Chinese leaders to meet with him to discuss
issues of their choice. Long-standing political disputes have
blocked a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Chen has also worked hard to cultivate a
strong relationship with the Clinton administration and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   During a meeting this past week with Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I.,
Chen told the lawmaker that he was grateful to President Clinton
for repeatedly reminding China that Taiwan is a democracy and any
resolution of the reunification issue should be agreeable to
Taiwanese voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope the United States will continue to be a firm supporter
of the Republic of China,'' Chen said, referring to Taiwan by its
official name.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although I don't want America to be a mediator. I just hope it
can assume an even more positive balancing and stabilizing role.''

<HEADLINE> Lions 15, Bills 13  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Jason Hanson's 50-yard field goal with
5:42 remaining capped a second-half comeback and lifted the Detroit
Lions to a 15-13 exhibition victory over the Buffalo Bills on
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   After Detroit (1-1) scored a touchdown in the first quarter, the
Bills (1-1) responded with 13 unanswered points in the second
quarter. But the Lions rallied by scoring eight points in the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   James Stewart scored on a 1-yard run and Hanson added a
33-yarder for the Lions, who also got two points on a safety.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Johnson, who played into the third quarter, hooked up with
Eric Moulds on a 72-yard touchdown pass play for Buffalo and Steve
Christie kicked two field goals for the Bills.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills, who lost six yards while going three-and-out on their
first possession, had a second-and-10 situation from their own 2 on
their next possession when linebacker Allen Aldridge stepped in
front of a pass intended for Shawn Price.
</P>
<P>
   Aldridge lumbered nine yards to the Bills 3 before being hauled
down by Jonathan Linton.
</P>
<P>
   Two snaps later, Stewart slanted into the end zone for a 7-0
Detroit lead.
</P>
<P>
   Aldridge, who also snaps on punts, drew a penalty for
double-pumping early in the second quarter. After the penalty, Fred
Jones blocked John Jett's punt. The Bills took over on Detroit's
28, setting up a 37-yard field goal by Christie.
</P>
<P>
   On the first play of Buffalo's next possession, Johnson found
Moulds wide open in broken coverage. Moulds turned the catch into a
touchdown and a 10-7 Buffalo lead.
</P>
<P>
   Christie capped a 57-yard, 10-play drive with a 32-yard field
goal with 23 seconds left in the quarter and the Bills went off
with a 13-7 lead when Hanson missed from 56 yards out as time
expired.
</P>
<P>
   Marquis Walker's interception of Alex Van Pelt's pass in the
third quarter led to Hanson's first field goal, cutting the lead to
13-10 early in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit closed to 13-12 on a safety with 9:09 left when tackle
Jon Carman was flagged for holding defensive end James Hall in the
Bills' end zone.
</P>
<P>
   The game marked the 21st time the Bills played the Lions in
preseason play, the most for a Buffalo exhibition opponent. The
Lions lead the preseason series with a 12-8-1 record.
</P>
<P>
   The teams have met only six times in the regular season, with
Detroit holding a 2-3-1 edge.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Albert Belle hit a two-out, two-run
homer to cap a four-run ninth inning, and the Baltimore Orioles
overcame Jermaine Dye's six RBIs to beat the Kansas City Royals
12-11 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City trailed 8-3 in the fifth before taking an 11-8 lead
in the eighth on a two-run single by Dye off Buddy Groom (5-3) and
Mark Quinn's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Delino DeShields hit a two-run single off Jerry Spradlin in the
ninth and Belle followed with a homer off Ricky Bottalico (7-4),
who blew a save for the seventh time in 20 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Kohlmeier pitched the ninth for his third save in three
chances. Todd Dunwoody singled leading off and Carlos Febles
sacrificed before Johnny Damon flied out and pinch-hitter Gregg
Zaun grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   Dye, who matches his RBIs high, was 3-for-5 with a pair of
homers, raising his total to a career-high 28, one more than he hit
last year. It was his third multihomer game of the season, the
sixth of his career.
</P>
<P>
   He started the comeback with a two-run homer in the fifth off
John Parrish, then hit another two-run homer in the seventh off
Mike Trombley. Mark Quinn tied it later in the inning with an RBI
single.
</P>
<P>
   Royals starter Blake Stein was pounded for eight runs and five
hits in 2 1-3 innings, walking four batters and throwing a pair of
wild pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore's John Parrish gave up five runs, six hits and four
walks in 5 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   There were 10 walks in the game and nine of those runners
scored.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore scored twice in the first on Melvin Mora's RBI double
and a run-scoring error by Dye in right, but Kansas City took a 3-2
lead in the second on RBI singles Febles and Rey Sanchez around
Damon's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles took an 8-3 lead with a six-run third on
bases-loaded walks to Jeff Conine and Chris Richard, a run-scoring
wild pitch and a three-run homer by Brook Fordyce.
</P>
<P>
Notes  Damon's sacrifice fly with his 10th, giving the Royals a
league-leading 52. ... Jerry Hairston stole his first base of the
season in the third. ... Thirty-one of Stein's 77 pitches were
balls. It was is shortest outing of the season. His ERA went from
5.89 to 7.14. ... Fordyce has hit in 15 of his last 19 games, and
in eight of 10 for since Baltimore acquired him from the Chicago
White Sox on July 29.
