<HEADLINE> Most Pakistanis Welcome Military Takeover: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Eighty percent of Pakistani
people welcomed the taking over of the government by General
Pervez Musharraf in last October, a political survey here showed.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the state-run Associated Press of
Pakistan (APP) on Sunday, the survey conducted by All Pakistan
Voters Association also showed that 87 percent of people expressed
their love for "true democracy."
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted in all the four provinces among people
from all walks of life, APP said.
</P>
<P>
In the present circumstances, 52 percent of the population
expressed satisfaction over the steps taken by the present
government, the survey said. People want significant, effective
and positive changes in the situation according to the established
standard of democracy, APP said.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that more than half, or 56 percent, of
Pakistanis want to change the country's constitution. The most
common reasons for the change are failure of the previous
governments to enforce the constitution in its entirety, it added.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's armed forced led by General Musharraf dismissed the
former government, which had been mired in political and economic
crunches, on October 12, 1999 and Musharraf assumed the position
of chief executive in the ensuing military government.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Again Demands Inclusion in European Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Defense Minister Sabahattin
Cakmakoglu said that Europe should take Turkey into consideration
during the course of its effort to set up a European Security and
Defense Identity (ESDI), the Anatolia News Agency reported on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey favors a European security and defense mechanism in
which Turkey will be able to fully participate on an equal
footing," the minister said prior to his departure for the United
States to attend a ceremony to be held on the anniversary of the
Second World War Normandy landing.
</P>
<P>
The proposed ESDI envisages the establishment of a decision-
making structure over defense under the European Union, independent
from the U.S.-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and
excluding non-EU members.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, an official EU candidate, has made efforts to join the
European defense mechanism, under the support of the U.S. which was
worried that the ESDI will reduce Washington's role in European
security.
</P>
<P>
Cakmakoglu said that Ankara has been an active contributor,
within the framework of NATO, to European security since the Cold
War and should not be excluded from a European security and defense
architecture.
</P>
<P>
NATO will hold a defense ministers' meeting at Brussels on June
8-9 to assess the latest developments in Kosovo and Bosnia-
Herzegovina. Cakmakoglu said that during the meeting, Turkey will
once again firmly voice its demand.

<HEADLINE> Barak, Albright Discuss Israeli-Palestinian Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli-Palestinian peace talks is
the core of the Middle East peace process after Israeli troop
withdrawal from south Lebanon, said U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright here Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Israeli-Palestinian problem and the difference
between the two sides can only be solved through negotiations,
Albright told reporters after her talks with Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
Albright arrived here earlier Monday afternoon from Moscow for a
two-day visit, aimed at narrowing the difference between Israel and
the Palestinians in reaching a framework agreement on final-status
issues.
</P>
<P>
Albright stressed that in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks,
proposals and positions of one party can not be 100-percent
satisfactory to the other side, so the peace talks need both sides
to make concessions.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, she said, President Bill Clinton and herself will
continue to make every effort to help the two sides reach a
framework agreement as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians launched their intensive peace talks
in March in the United States to solve the key issues such as the
fate of Jerusalem, Jewish settlements, Palestinian refugees, border
and water. They moved the talks to the region in April.
</P>
<P>
But in May, the two sides opened a secret channel in Stockholm,
capital of Sweden, to speed up the finalization of the framework
agreement. This channel has also been moved to the region by the
end of May.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami, who led the
Israeli delegation to the secret talks, has said that some progress
has been made by the two sides in reaching this framework
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials voiced their hope that Albright's current
visit could clear the way for a three-way summit by the end of June
in the United States between Clinton, Barak and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
It has been hoped that a Camp David-style meeting could solve
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict once and for all. Leaders of the
U.S., Egypt and Israel met in Camp David in 1979 to hammer out a
treaty, the first between an Arab country and the Jewish state, to
realize peace between Egypt and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Barak said that the three-way summit is important for the peace
process, but this summit could only be held when Israel's security
is guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
Barak told his cabinet on Sunday that the summit would see "real
negotiations" on key issues of the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Israel's next troop redeployment in the West Bank,
Barak promised to complete such a redeployment by the end of June.
But he did not say how many land he will hand over to the
Palestinians in the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords, Israel has to transfer all remaining
West bank territories to the Palestinian in the last redeployment
before reaching a final peace treaty with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
As for the Palestinian refugee problem, he said such issue can
be solved in the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli-Syrian track, Albright said she will discuss this
issue with Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh in Cairo on
Wednesday on her way home.
</P>
<P>
The door of the Israeli-Syrian track has not been closed, she
said, but at the movement the major task is to push the Israeli-
Palestinian peace talks forward.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace talks stalled again in January after
two rounds in the U.S. starting last December, due to Israel's
refusal to hand over to Syrian the entire Golan Heights it captured
in the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
Albright also appreciated Israel's withdrawal from south
Lebanon, saying the pullout was a major step forward in the Middle
East peace process. Israel pulled its troops out on May 24.
</P>
<P>
Albright is scheduled to hold talks with Arafat on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
While Barak and Albright were holding their talks in the Prime
Minister's office, a group of right-wing protestors gathered
outside, asking Barak not to make concessions to the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Islamic Militant Sentenced to 10-Year Hard Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's High Security Court on Monday
sentenced an Islamic militant, Mohammed Mustafa Hassan, to 10 years
of forced labor, the country's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Hassan was accused of belonging to an outlawed fundamentalist
group, Jamaa Islamiya, trying to kill police officers, destroy
tourist sites and seek to overthrow the government.
</P>
<P>
He was sentenced to the same punishment in absentia in 1998
after a court tried a group of 22 militants. Under Egyptian law,
persons convicted in absentia must be retried after they are
captured. Hassan was arrested last year.
</P>
<P>
All other members of the group are currently serving labor
sentences except their leader, Mustapha Hamza, who lives in exile.
He is accused of involvement in the attempted assassination of
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in 1995 when the president visited
Addis Ababa. Hamza was condemned to death in absentia in 1992 and
1994.
</P>
<P>
Jamaa Islamiya began an insurrection in 1992 in an attempt to
topple the secular government and introduce a strict Islamic rule.
It claimed responsibility for killing 58 foreign tourists at
Egypt's Luxor historical site in 1997. Since then the government
has tightened security measures to crack down on Islamic radicals.

<HEADLINE> Greek Cypriot Soldier Reportedly Detained by Turkish Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A Greek Cypriot soldier, who was
reported missing Sunday, has been abducted by the Turkish troops in
northern Cyprus, Cyprus News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sarah Russell, spokeswoman of UNFICYP (U.N. Peacekeeping Force
in Cyprus) confirmed that the soldier, Giorgos Kasianides, 21, from
Cyprus' southern coastal town of Larnaca, might appear before a "
court" Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have been in touch with the people in the north and we are
hoping to visit him tomorrow morning," Russell said, adding "we
believe he is due to appear in an illegal court tomorrow morning."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup in Nicosia seeking union with
Athens.
</P>
<P>
Since then Turkey has maintained some 35,000 troops in northern
Cyprus with the claimed aim of protecting the Turkish Cypriot
minority.
</P>
<P>
Russell said that arrangements are being made for an UNFICYP
delegation comprising "our civilian police and an UNFICYP doctor"
to visit Kasianides.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cyprus' Defense Ministry spokesman Andreas Charides
said the Ministry had received information that Kasianides "had
been abducted by the Turks and taken to the Turkish occupied part
of Nicosia."
</P>
<P>
So far, nobody disclosed why the Turkish troops detained or "
abducted" the Greek Cypriot soldier, and there has been no
information about any comment from the Turkish side on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Syria, Qatar to Cement Economic, Trade Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Syria and Qatar have agreed to cut
down tariffs on imported goods on a reciprocal basis by up to 70
percent by 2002 and to tax free a year later, Syrian Arab News
Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed here by Syrian Minister of Economy and
Foreign Trade Mohammed al-Emadi and his Qatari counterpart Yousef
Hussein Kamal at the conclusion of a meeting of the Syrian-Qatari
Joint Commission on Economic and Trade Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to establish a joint free trade zone
(FTZ) based on granting reciprocal tariff exemption on farm and
animal products and natural wealth, said a communique issued after
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
On agriculture and water cooperation, the two sides also agreed
to
exchange relevant information and study results on plant and animal
diseases control.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they reached a consensus on the need to avoid double
taxation, and to protect and encourage joint investments. They
pledged to continue the talks on the expert level on the issues
soon, according to the document.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also signed a memorandum of understanding
involving two pacts on cooperation between the Syrian Chambers of
Commerce Union and Qatari Trade and Industry Chamber, and
establishing a businessmen council between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two pacts provided for exchanging visits between investors
from both countries to get acquainted with the trade opportunities
available in each other's country, launching joint ventures in the
various economic domains, and holding seminars to exchange
information on the incentives and advantages offered for businesses
from both countries.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also signed a memo of understanding on tourism
cooperation and another one on bilateral civil aviation
cooperation, allowing four flights by their carriers per week
between
both states.
</P>
<P>
Yousef Hussein Kamal arrived here on Saturday for a three-day
official visit to Syria.

up to 3.5316 billion dollars, 2.7 percent of all Spanish purchases.
</P>
<P>
In China there are 140 Spanish firms, representing only 0.1
percent of all companies with foreign capital established in this
Asian country.
</P>
<P>
State Secretary of Trade and Tourism Juan Costa said China's
forthcoming entry to WTO will bring down tariffs for Spanish
products by half, the average tariff going from 17.5 percent to 8
percent.

<HEADLINE> France to Cut Short Presidential Term to Five Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- France will cut short its
presidential term from seven years to five years in a major reform
of the Constitution of the Fifth Republic drafted under General
Charles de Gaulle.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac said Monday evening that he
approves a reform which shortens the office of the president by
two years but does not restrict the number of terms to be served
by a French citizen elected president.
</P>
<P>
In a televised interview with TF1 and France 2, Chirac said
that he hopes to push through the constitutional reform through a
referendum by the end of September, after the draft law is adopted
by the National Assembly and the Senate at the end of June before
the parliament deputies leave for summer vacation.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Socialist government of Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin announced simultaneously that a draft law on
shortening the presidential term will be presented by the
government to the National Assembly on June 14.
</P>
<P>
France will hold its next presidential election in 2002 and
both Chirac, 69, and Jospin, 63, are expected to run for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
``After I have thought about it and listened to the opinions of
all, I concluded that we can shorten the presidential term from
seven to five years,'' Chirac said.
</P>
<P>
He said that a seven-year presidential term is ``too long
taking into account the modern requests of democracy,'' and that
the French people will have the legitimate right to express their
views on the reform through a referendum.
</P>
<P>
The proposal on shortening presidential office was first made
by former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing on May 9 at the
National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Before that, an opinion poll showed that three in four French
people prefer a five-year presidential term to the present seven-
year term.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, most of the political parties have expressed their
support to shortening the presidential office.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Objects to Key Microsoft Proposals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government rejected
Monday most suggestions from among many offered by Microsoft Corp.
to alter a proposal to break up the company, although it agreed to
a few minor changes.
</P>
<P>
In its last expected court filing before U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson decides how to punish Microsoft, Justice
Department antitrust lawyers rejected the company's suggestion
that a full year be granted to develop details of the breakup plan
for anti-competitive practices, saying that a full year "is
unwarranted."
</P>
<P>
The department has proposed to the judge that "not later than
four months" after a final judgment, the company must submit a
proposed plan for the breakup. Jackson already has found that
Microsoft stifled competition in violation of federal antitrust
law.
</P>
<P>
Government lawyers requested the opportunity to file the legal
brief to present the judge with areas of minor agreements. Most of
these agreements involved definitions, such as using the word "
divestiture" rather than "reorganization."
</P>
<P>
But the Justice Department lawyers, who filed suit along with
19 states, also stated numerous objections to the last proposals
by Microsoft. The company was allowed to comment Wednesday, after
which the judge is expected to rule on his remedy in the case
within a matter of days or weeks.
</P>
<P>
The filings this week do not change the proposal by the
department and 17 of the state plaintiffs that Microsoft be split
into two companies, one built around its Office software and
Internet businesses, and another with its Windows operating-system
software, the source of Microsoft's monopoly power.
</P>
<P>
The brief said many Microsoft suggestions "would create
loopholes and permit Microsoft to continue to engage in anti-
competitive practices like those found by the court or otherwise
to frustrate or undermine the purposes of the final judgment."
</P>
<P>
Among the objections, the department said it disagreed with
Microsoft's proposal to delete a provision involving contracts
with other companies. The government wants to ban the corporation
from entering into contracts that restrict other firms' ability to
develop, distribute and promote non-Microsoft software.
</P>
<P>
"Such agreements were an important part of Microsoft's illegal
campaign against Netscape's browser," the department said.
</P>
<P>
The government also rejected the company's proposal that it not
be required to retain its e-mails.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Lockerbie Case Goes on Despite New Allegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on Monday
that the Lockerbie case would not be affected by an assertion that
Iran was behind the Pam Am flight bomb plot, but said it would
follow evidence wherever it leads.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that case is very solid, and that case will proceed,
" State Department spokesman Philip Reeker told reporters.
</P>
<P>
His comments came as CBS television said on Sunday that a
senior intelligence service defector, now being debriefed by the
CIA in Turkey, had said he had documents to prove Iran trained a
group of Libyans to stage the bombing of the Pam Am flight.
</P>
<P>
"We've stated always that we will follow evidence wherever it
leads. That's always been our position. Right now, we are
assessing credibility of any information that may be provided,"
Reeker said.
</P>
<P>
He said Washington had made clear it would not discuss the case
in detail while the case is going on. It is being held at Camp
Zeist in the Netherlands under Scottish law.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican President Calls for Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano Monday called on the people in the country to put
environmental awareness into their daily activities.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony marking the World Environment Day in the
southern city of Chibuto, which was hit hardest by floods early
this year, Chissano said that the protection of environment has
become the "strategic task" of the government.
</P>
<P>
Noting a periodic recurrence of drought and flooding in
Mozambique in recent years causing great losses to the national
economy, the president stressed that this is a result of the
denudation of natural resources and also a punishment of nature to
human beings.
</P>
<P>
There is an urgent need for the country to kick off a
comprehensive law of environmental protection reinforced with
relevant plans, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, environmental protection is not a task only for the
government, it should become the common sense of the whole society
and be reflected in everybody's daily life and behavior, Chissano
said.
</P>
<P>
People should draw lessons from the devastating flooding in
February and March this year and stop destroying forests to avoid
any further soil erosion, he said.
</P>
<P>
After the ceremony, Chissano joined local people in planting
more than 3, 000 seedlings.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique has frequently suffered from natural disasters
including droughts in the early 1990s and successive floodings in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
It experienced the most serious flooding in the past 50 years
in southern and central parts of the country early this year,
leaving 330,000 people homeless and more than 2 million others
affected.
</P>
<P>
The international community has promised to give the country
425 million U.S. dollars in aid to help those affected by the
floods and to boost the post-disaster rehabilitation work.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Starts Trial of Collaborators with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A military tribunal started trial
here Monday of 32 Lebanese, mostly members of the pro-Israeli South
Lebanon Army (SLA), on charges of collaboration with the enemy,
Oriental radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The 32 defendants were charged with "divulging information to
the enemy, collaborating with the enemy and working in Israel,"
said the radio report.
</P>
<P>
Most of the accused were among some 1,700 SLA members who
surrendered to the Lebanese government after Israel's withdrawal
from south Lebanon on May 24. The others were former employees of
the Civil Administration set up by Israel in the occupied border
zone.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that a total of 35 lawyers will form the defense
team for the defendants.
</P>
<P>
The SLA militia, armed and funded by Israel, helped the
occupation troops patrol the so-called security zone carved out by
Israel in 1985 after two invasions.
</P>
<P>
But the 3,000-strong proxy army quickly collapsed as Israel
began pulling out of south Lebanon. Thousands of its members gave
themselves up to Hezbollah guerrillas or Lebanese authorities,
before, during and after the Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
About 6,000 SLA militiamen and their family members took refuge
in Israel. But some of them have returned to Lebanon as they
preferred facing trial in their home country.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minster Salim Hoss has urged those Lebanese
staying in Israel to come home to stand for "just trial."

<HEADLINE> Albright in Middle East to Mediate Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright arrived in the Middle East Monday afternoon from Moscow,
hoping to bridge the gap between Israelis and the Palestinians in
reaching a framework agreement on final-status issues.
</P>
<P>
This was Albright's first visit to the region since the Sharm el
Sheikh conference last September, and the visit was arranged during
U.S. President Bill Clinton's talks with Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak in Lisbon, Portugal, last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During her two-day mission in the region, Albright is scheduled
to hold talks with Barak later in the evening and meet with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Tuesday. She will also travel
to Egypt to hold talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on her
way home.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials said Monday that they hope Albright could,
during the visit, help narrow the differences between Israel and
the Palestinian side on the key issues in the final-status talks
and clear the way for a three-way summit in the United States by
the end of this month between Clinton, Barak and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Albright will listen to Barak and Arafat to gauge the degree of
flexibility that they are willing to display, in order to advise
Clinton on the administration's next moves for pushing the Middle
East peace process forward, the officials added.
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me she will take her recommendation to President
Clinton on whether or not to invite the sides to a summit.
Personally I believe that the moment of truth has arrived,"Minister
in the Prime Minister's Office Haim Ramon said.
</P>
<P>
Barak, evoking the Camp David talks that led to the pioneer
Israel-Egypt peace treaty in 1979, told his cabinet on Sunday that
if convened, the summit would see "real negotiations" on key issues
in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Palestinian negotiators launched their intensive final-
status talks in the United States in March and shifted talks to the
region by the end of April. At the same time, they opened a secret
channel in May in Swedish capital Stockholm, aimed at speeding up
talks on reaching the framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami, who led the
Israeli delegation at the secret talks, has said the negotiations
have made some progress on all key issues such as the fate of
Jerusalem, Jewish settlement, Palestinian refugees, border and
water.
</P>
<P>
Despite the achievements, differences remain between the two
sides. Israel has insisted on signing this framework agreement
before reaching the final peace treaty by September, while the
Palestinian side proposed to discard the framework accord because
time it short.
</P>
<P>
Israel also rejected the Palestinian demand for transferring to
them, as stipulated by the 1993 Oslo accords, all the occupied
territories before reaching the final peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Clinton really wants to coax Israel and the
palestinians into another peace deal before leaving office in seven
months. If the final peace treaty can not be signed by September,
then he would try to force the two sides to reach this framework
accord when he is still in office.
</P>
<P>
And that is why he send Albright back to the Middle East this
time.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Willing to Develop Ties with Turkey: Ramadan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin
Ramadan said here on Monday that Iraq is willing to develop
relations with Turkey in various fields.
</P>
<P>
To develop "strategic ties" with Turkey, based on mutual
respect, will contribute to peace and stability in the region,
Ramadan said while meeting with visiting Turkish Foreign Ministry
Undersecretary Faruk Logoglu.
</P>
<P>
Iraq favors "an open and constructive dialog" with Iraq, said
the vice president.
</P>
<P>
However, he expressed concern over the facilities which Turkey
provides to the U.S. and British warplanes in their almost daily
aggressions over northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British warplanes have been patrolling the so-called
no-fly zone in northern Iraq from an airbase in Turkey, allegedly
aimed at protecting the Kurdish population in the region.
</P>
<P>
A similar air exclusion zone was also imposed in southern Iraq
by the U.S.-led Western allies to protect Shiite Muslims there
after the 1991 Gulf war which was triggered by Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan demanded the Turkish government take into consideration
of its own interests and not pursue a foreign policy which creates
problems and instability in the region, the official Iraqi News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Logoglu said that Turkey desires to develop
relations with Iraq, adding that he hopes for more cooperation
between Turkey and Iraq in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Logoglu and his delegation arrived here on Sunday for a four-day
visit to Iraq, which aims at smoothing the way for better relations
between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Political relations between the two countries have been cool.
Iraq has long criticized Turkey for allowing the U.S. and British
planes to take off from its bases to enforce the no-fly zone in
northern Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait, Saudi Arabia to Open Talks on Border Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are due
to start talks in the Saudi capital of Riyadh on Tuesday on the
demarcation of their maritime borders in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Saud Nasser Al-Sabah will lead a
high-ranking delegation to Riyadh for the meeting with Saudi
Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources Ali Ibrahim al-N'aimi,
Kuwait News Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The talks are aimed at reaching an agreement on the maritime Al-
Dorra gas field located in the continental shelf in a sector in
northern Gulf waters.
</P>
<P>
The demarcation of the continental shelf is subject to rival
claims by Iran, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The three Gulf states have been locked in talks for years to
agree on a demarcation scheme, but have failed so far.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Iran conducted drilling in the disputed area
but stopped the operations in May when the dispute emerged again.
</P>
<P>
Tehran had reportedly expressed readiness to hold meetings with
Kuwait to reach an understanding on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti diplomats in Riyadh said the Kuwaiti-Saudi talks would
be conducted in a manner that protects their joint interests.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, senior Saudi officials have also expressed confidence
that Saudi Arabia and Kuwait would solve the problem soon in a way
that would serve the interests of both states and their "
distinguished relations."

<HEADLINE> Israel Continues Pumping Water to Jordan: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A senior Jordanian official on Monday
dismissed as groundless press reports that Israel has stopped
providing water to Jordan during the current summer season, playing
down a potential water crisis between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The official, with the Ministry of Water and Irrigation, said on
condition of anonymity that the Jewish state is "currently pumping
water to King Abdullah Canal (in Jordan) from Tiberias Lake
according to the time schedule agreed upon ... and through the
Joint Water Committee that holds its meetings regularly."
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers on Monday quoted reports from Israel as saying
that Israel has suspended water supplies to Jordan due to a chronic
drought in the region and the expiration of a three-year bilateral
water agreement at the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Jordan takes water clauses as the most important and
indispensible part of its 1994 peace treaty with Israel, and its
officials has vowed to scrap the whole peace treaty if Israel did
not implement bilateral water agreements to the letter.
</P>
<P>
Under various bilateral water arrangements, Jordan allows Israel
to pump more water in winter from the Yarmouk River, save the water
in the Tiberias lake before pumping some 25 to 30 million cubic
meters of water back to Jordan during the summer time.
</P>
<P>
The capital city Amman and the western and northern parts of
Jordan, the most populous areas of the kingdom, are under the
influence of the Mediterranean Sea, hot and dry in summer, rainy
and humid in winter.
</P>
<P>
For years, Jordan has been a major peace broker between Israel
and its Arab neighbors in the fragile peace process in the region.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Meets German FM on Regional Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Yasser Arafat received German Foreign Minister
Joschka Fischer in the West Bank city of Ramallah on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed the Middle East peace process,
especially the Palestinian track, the Palestinian News Agency
(WAFA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Arafat briefed Fischer on the latest developments of the peace
talks and the difficulties facing them due to Israel's refusal to
implement the signed accords and the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The talks dealt also with European, especially German, role in
the peace process as well as the bilateral ties between Germany and
Palestine. Fischer underscored the German supportive position to
the Palestinian people and the PNA, according to WAFA.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Minister of Planning and International Cooperation
Nabil Shaath described the talks in a joint press conference with
Fischer as "important." Germany is one of the two major donor
countries in Palestinian reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians can never give up their sovereignty over
Jerusalem and there can be no solution to the Middle East issue
without the holy city because it is a major part of Palestinian
territories occupied by Israel in 1967, and the future capital of a
Palestinian state, Shaath stressed.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Fischer said he held a "constructive and serious
dialog" with Arafat on the peace process. There is an opportunity
to push forward the peace process and reach a permanent peace
agreement between the Palestinians and Israelis, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We in the European Union as well as in Germany support the
peace process," Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
On the expected German role in the regional peace process,
Fischer said his country was not only a donor country and a source
of financial support but also an influential power in the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
The German minister arrived in the region Sunday evening on a
working visit to Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas. He is
scheduled to meet Israeli cabinet members Monday evening.

<HEADLINE> Arab Summit Called for Enhancing Arab Cooperation, Coordination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of eight Arab
countries wound up a two-day meeting on Monday by calling for more
Arab meetings and demanding that Israel withdraw from all Lebanese
lands.
</P>
<P>
The signatories of Damascus Declaration, which consists of Egypt
and Syria and the six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council --
Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria and the United
Arab Emirates -- issued a statement, which urged an Arab summit to
be held "as early as possible to enhance Arab cooperation and
coordination."
</P>
<P>
Only one Arab summit has been held since the 1991 Gulf War,
which was prompted by Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The meeting,
held in Cairo in 1996, excluded Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed on holding an experts meeting to determine
the practical steps to activate relations among the signatories of
the declaration in economic, cultural, scientific and technological
spheres, the statement said, without specifying a date or place.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers also praised the Israeli pullout from
south Lebanon on May 24 as "Lebanese victory resulted from the
solidarity between the government and the people and the Lebanese
resistance.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met the ministers earlier in
the day. Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh gave him a message
from President Hafez al-Assad, recalling Syria's position on the
Israeli pullback from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel should not ignore the U.N. Security Council Resolutions
242 and 338 while applying Resolution 425 (on the withdrawal from
Lebanon), Shareh told reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council Resolution 242 of November 1967 called
for an Israeli withdrawal from "territories occupied in the recent
conflict," while 338 of 1973 called for the implementation of 242.
</P>
<P>
Damascus is demanding that Israel withdraw from the whole of the
Golan Heights, which it seized in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed
in December 1981. Israel has said it is ready to withdraw from most
of the strategic plateau, but not back to the line in force when it
captured it.
</P>
<P>
"We shall express our support for Syria and assert our rejection
of any attempt to put pressure on Syria to weaken its position in
the negotiations," Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said when
the ministerial meeting opened Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Damascus Declaration, signed after the Gulf War in March
1991, was designed to provide political, economic and military
cooperation among its members.

TEHRAN, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Monday reiterated its
sovereignty over three strategic islands in the Persian Gulf, which
are also claimed by the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
The three islands, namely Abu Mussa and Greater and Lesser
Tunbs, belong to Iran, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid

</P>
<P>
Asefi said that Iran has announced time and again its readiness
to hold direct talks with the UAE within the framework of the 1971
accord so as to iron out differences over the islands.
</P>
<P>
Asefi made the remarks in a response to the recent meeting of
foreign ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in Riyadh,
which urged Iran to cooperate with the GCC Tripartite Commission on
the disputed islands to find a peaceful solution.
</P>
<P>
The GCC ministers also voiced willingness to expand ties with
Iran on the principles of good neighborliness, mutual respect, non-
interference in each other's internal affairs and resolving
disputes through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Iran took over the three Gulf islands close to the strategic
Hormuz Strait in 1971 after the British colonist forces retreated
from the region. However, Abu Dhabi also claimed sovereignty over
the islands.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the UAE called for international arbitration on
the dispute, but Iran insisted on direct bilateral talks to remove
the "misunderstanding".

<HEADLINE> Cairo FMs Meeting Breathes New Life Into Damascus Declaration: Egyptian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said on Monday that the 17th meeting of the Damascus Declaration
signatories took up important issues in a constructive and
objective manner, breathing new life into the declaration.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the two-day foreign ministers meeting held here,
Moussa told a press conference that there was "complete and all-out
support" for the Palestinian and Syrian stances on the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel must return the occupied Arab lands, including the Golan
Heights, the West Bank and Jerusalem, for a just, comprehensive and
lasting peace in the Middle East, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the issue of holding regular Arab summit, Moussa
said this is an "important and main issue" pertaining to Arab joint
action. An Arab League five-member committee, consisting of Egypt,
Oman, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen, will begin discussions in Cairo on
Tuesday of a mechanism for holding summit on a regular basis, he
added.
</P>
<P>
On the Iraqi issue, Moussa said Iraq should be given the hope to
see the light at the end of the tunnel. "Everyone is concerned
about the fate of the Iraqi people," he added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under international sanctions since its 1990
invasion of Kuwait. Baghdad maintains that it has honored the
relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions, and calls for the
lifting of the sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Greece Rejects U.S. Charges Against Athens on Terrorism Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Greece Monday rejected a U.S.
congressional report on terrorism as unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
In a 64-page report published by the U.S. daily "Washington
Post" Sunday, the National Committee on Terrorism proposed
sanctions against Greece because Athens was not cooperating fully
in combating terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Describing the report as "anti-Greek fabrication," Greek
government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said that such demands which
did not correspond to the true situation in Greece were not
acceptable.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that a memorandum for cooperation between
Greek and U.S. police had been drafted but no date for its
signature had yet been set.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright reportedly assured
Sunday that Washington was not examining the eventuality of
imposing sanctions against Greece, regardless of the congressional
report.

<HEADLINE> Annan: World Future Depends on Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Women not only belong to
this planet, but the future of this planet depends on women, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan stressed here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Opening the United Nations General Assembly special session on
women, held here at the Headquarters of the United Nations in New
York from June 5 to 9, Annan said since the Fourth World
Conference on Women in 1995, much progress has been achieved in
promoting the Equality between men and women.
</P>
<P>
"Violence against women is now illegal almost everywhere. There
has been worldwide mobilization against harmful traditional
practices such as so-called'honor killings'. In many countries,
new health strategies have saved thousands of women's lives,"
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"And a record number of women have become leaders and decision-
makers. Above all, more countries have understood that women's
equality is a prerequisite for development," Annan continued.
</P>
<P>
However, Annan noted, much remains to be done. "In economic
terms, the gender divide is still widening. Women earn less, are
more often unemployed and generally are poor than men."
</P>
<P>
"Violence against women is still increasing -- both in the home
and in new types of armed conflict which target civilian
population, with women and children as the first causalities,"
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Annan listed the spread of AIDS and trafficking of women and
children as the new challenges which should be addressed with
immediate action from all Member States.
</P>
<P>
"I have asked Member States, when they gather for the
Millennium Summit in September, to adopt specific goals for
halting and reversing the spread of HIV/AIDS," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
To address all the old and new challenges, women must be
educated and enabled to play part in the global economy, Annan
noted.

<P>
PARIS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The suspect arrested by French police
for allegedly sabotaging a railway and causing a train derailment
Sunday morning in southern France has admitted his act, said
French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Two passengers were killed and 12 injured in the derailment of
an international passenger train from Vintimille, Italy, to Calais,
northern France.
</P>
<P>
The suspect, Moussa Hammoudi, is a 32-year-old Algerian man who
had psychiatric problems because of brain damages caused by a car
accident, said Chevenement.
</P>
<P>
The interior minister also ruled out the possibility of an
involvement by the Algerian terrorist group GIA and said the
accident was created by ``an act of malice'' by Hammoudi alone.
</P>
<P>
Hammoudi himself also said that he acted alone and no one else
helped him, said police.
</P>
<P>
He admitted placing some rails on the railway track in a
southern French town called Chasse-sur-Rhone in order to derail
the train.

MOSCOW, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Polish consul in Russia's second
largest city of St. Petersburg was detained by Russian customs
while trying to smuggle antiques, said the Russian police Monday.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat was arrested at the Sebezh customs office on the
Russian-Belarussian border in late May, because the trunk of the
consul's car contained "three icons, two picture frames, a silver
vase and coffee pot, an antique trunk and a wooden table, without
the permission of the Russian Culture Ministry to take away the
articles,"the police told journalists, without giving the name of
the diplomat.
</P>
<P>
The antiques have been taken for examination. Individuals do
not pass through customs on the Russian- Belarussian border, but
the police informed customs about the consul in advance, they said.
</P>
<P>
The Polish embassy in Moscow refused to comment on this
incident or name the arrested consul, only saying that they are
still studying the situation with the event.

Figures from the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply

stability during "a meeting of old friends," said chief of Yeltsin
's protocol department Vladimir Shevchenko.
</P>
<P>
The meeting at Yeltsin's Gorki-9 residence in Moscow lasted for

issues,among them the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty signed

</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Clinton reviewed the efforts made by them since
1992 to accelerate the developments of the relations between the
two countries, stressing that the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty-
II(START II) they initiated and concluded "cleared the way for the
two states' new leaders to pursue fruitful work to this end."

politics but recalling the past days, drinking tea and eating
traditional nut cakes and a honey pie baked by Naina Iosifovna (
Boris Yeltsin's wife)," he said.

<P>
ROME, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin
proposed Monday a joint anti-missile shield with the European
Union (EU) and NATO in response to the United States insistence on
pushing ahead with its own anti-missile system.
</P>
<P>
After talks with Italian Prime Minister Giuliano Amato, Putin
who arrived here Monday afternoon told reporters that the proposal
would avoid upsetting the balance of forces, while also giving
all European countries a "100 percent guarantee" of security with
the support of their American partner.
</P>
<P>
In their summit in Moscow at the weekend, Putin and U.S.
President Bill Clinton signed agreements to eliminate enriched
plutonium from nuclear warheads and set up a joint missile launch
monitoring center.
</P>
<P>
But Putin refused to accept the amendment of the Anti-Ballistic
Missile (ABM) treaty which Clinton needs to go ahead with the
planned U.S. anti-missile shield.
</P>
<P>
In his long talk with Amato, Putin said close attention was
given to international security.
</P>
<P>
"I asked Amato to study the question more closely with his
European colleagues," Putin reported.
</P>
<P>
"We know that many in Europe and the world are concerned about
maintaining the ABM agreement signed in 1972," said the Russian
president, "we share this viewpoint."
</P>
<P>
He also thanked the European leaders for their support of
international nuclear arms limitation agreements such as the
comprehensive test ban treaty, the reduction of tactical nuclear
weapons and the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.

<HEADLINE> EU Ministers Back Greek Euro-Zone Entry Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, June 5 (Xinhua) -- European Union finance ministers
on Monday expressed their support for Greece's bid to join the
single currency mechanism.
</P>
<P>
The Greek entry bid will have to be last approved by the summit
meeting of the European Union heads of state and government on
June 19 and 20 in the Portuguese town of Santa Maria da Feira.
</P>
<P>
Greece missed the first wave of adoption of the euro on January
1 last year due to its failure to meet the entry criteria of low
inflation, budget deficit and public debt.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
European Union, last week recommended that the Greek currency be
absorbed into the single currency mechanism at a rate of 340.75
per euro.
</P>
<P>
Of the 15 EU member states, Britain, Sweden and Denmark will
still remain outside the single currency zone.
</P>
<P>
Greece's joining into the euro zone was seen by some as a
weakening factor to the euro that has been dropping in exchange
rate against the United States dollar until last week.
</P>
<P>
The finance ministers from the euro zone expressed their
optimism that the euro's rebound in recent days was the start of a
period of strength after months of decline against the dollar.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Women Issue Incorporated into Overall Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- China urged here Monday the
international community to incorporate women's issue into its
overall strategy for peace and development, calling women a "great
force for human progress."
</P>
<P>
Wu Yi, China's state councillor, told a special session of the
U.N.General Assembly on women that "without the participation of
women, there can be no development and lasting peace will be
difficult to come by."
</P>
<P>
She was among the delegates from more than 180 countries to
the special U.N.session being held on June 5 to 9 under the theme
of Women 2000: Gender Equality, Development and Peace for the 21st
Century.
</P>
<P>
Wu arrived here Sunday, heading a delegation which for the
first time includes officials from Hong Kong and Macao since they
returned respectively to China's sovereignty in 1997 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese official put forward a four-point proposal which
calls for efforts to stop war and armed conflict, eliminate women'
s poverty, ensure women's full participation in the economic
globalization process and promote the role of the U.N. system.
</P>
<P>
"Women are the most vulnerable and biggest victims in war and
armed conflicts. Only when wars and armed conflicts are rooted out
can women's cause move forward," she said.
</P>
<P>
She called on all countries to strictly abide by the purposes
and principles of the U.N. Charter and the basic principles of
international law, work to resolve international disputes by
peaceful means and firmly uphold the leading role of the U.N. for
international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Wu Yi believed that the significance of poverty elimination to
the development of women should be fully recognized and priority
should be given to promoting economic and social development and
eliminating poverty among women in the effort to raise their
status.
</P>
<P>
"Developed countries and relevant international institutions
should faithfully fulfill their obligations in this regard," she
said without elaboration.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese official urged for serious efforts to study the
negative impact of economic globalization on women's development
as well as effective measures to prevent women, particularly those
in developing countries, from being marginalized in the process.
</P>
<P>
"Economic globalization both affords opportunities and
presents severe challenges to the cause of women," she added.
</P>
<P>
Wu Yi asked the U.N. to play a more effective role in guiding
and coordinating international progress of the work on women." The
U.N.should encourage regional efforts to establish and strengthen
coordinating mechanisms in relation to women's issues so as to
enhance regional cooperation and promote the process of women's
cause in all regions," she said.

In many places HIV infection in young women has been found to
be 3-5 times higher than among boys, said Dr. Peter Piot,
Executive Director of the Joint U.N. Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS).
He called on men to change their behavior to help get the epidemic
slow down.
</P>
<P>
Tracing biological and social factors which make women and
girls more vulnerable to AIDS than men, Piot said violence or the
threat of violence against women increases their vulnerability to
HIV, the virus causing AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Besides, women's dependence on men makes them less able to
protect themselves, he told the U.N. Special Session on the follow-
up to the Fourth International Conference on Women.
</P>
<P>
U.N. figures show that 33.6 million people were living with HIV
or AIDS, and 16.3 million had already died from the disease by the
end of 1999.

able to prevent conflicts, he said, noting that in Africa, the
best performing countries in the economic and social sphere are
those that have avoided conflicts.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the ECA, as an organ of Africa and
the United Nations, advocates that greater attention be paid to
measures for preventing or containing crises before they erupt
into violent confrontation.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that one third of the population of Africa
suffers from direct consequences of on-going conflicts.
</P>
<P>
There is an urgent need to prevent conflicts and disputes from
escalating into armed hostilities, and this calls for the
strengthening of conflict resolution mechanisms for negotiation,
mediation, conciliation and arbitration at the governmental,
political and diplomatic levels, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the final analysis, we should bear in mind that peace and
development are two sides of the same coin, which means that
Africa's development will not occur in the unstable and insecure
environment created by conflicts," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Durable peace can only be achieved with development," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Coastal, Marine Project Boosted by World Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has approved, through
its soft loans affiliate, the International Development
Association, a 5.6 million U. S. dollar credit for Mozambique to
assist its government in achieving sustainable economic
development of coastal zone resources.
</P>
<P>
According to a World Bank press release received here on
Monday, the credit supplements an earlier 4.1 million U.S. dollar
grant from the bank's Global Environmental Facility.
</P>
<P>
"The funds will support the coastal and marine biodiversity
management project, which is a key element of Mozambique's
National Coastal Zone Management Program -- in particular its
strategy for coastal and marine biodiversity protection and
sustainable use of natural resources," the news release said.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the project, to be tested in the northern
provinces of Nampula and Cabo Delgado, will pilot and refine an
approach through strategic development planning that balances
ecological, social and physical values with the various
development interests in the coastal area.
</P>
<P>
The project will seek to introduce strategic spatial planning
that fully integrates conservation with regional development. It
is intended to establish and strengthen protection of key
terrestrial and marine conservation areas and initiate
conservation-oriented activities for communities.
</P>
<P>
The project also aims to establish best practices for
environmentally and biodiversity-friendly economic development and
strengthen institutional arrangements for devolving coastal and
marine resource planning to provincial and local levels.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Madagascar, Mozambique is the only country in the
East African Marine Region with major brackish coastal barrier
lagoons and supports the most extensive mangrove forests and sea
grass beds, as well as the best coral assemblages, along the East
African mainland.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Listed Among Top African Nations to Attract More Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has told
Tanzania it is among the top three poor African countries that may
attract more funding due to its impressive economic recovery
performance and good governance.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before launching a new report on Africa's
outlook here on Monday, the bank's chief economist in Africa Alen
Gelb said Tanzania should be one of the top three African
countries that are bound to attract more funding due to its good
economic record.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not identify the other two countries.
</P>
<P>
Gelb explained that countries likely to qualify for more
funding are those with good governance, good economic performance
records and a decreasing level of poverty in that country.
</P>
<P>
He said the poverty alleviation initiative implemented in
Tanzania under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) program
is the most impressive in the fight against poverty.
</P>
<P>
On the new report titled "Can Africa Claim the 21st Century",
Gelb said it is not a panacea to resolve African continent
problems, but simply a review of major setbacks hampering
development in the region.
</P>
<P>
He listed the major hindrances to African economic development
as civil wars, HIV/AIDS, poor levels of infrastructure and
education.
</P>
<P>
The report suggested fundamental policy changes in Africa and
the needs for its economy to grow by 5 percent a year in order to
keep the poverty from growing.
</P>
<P>
It has been jointly prepared by the United Nations Economic
Commission for Africa, the Global Coalition for Africa, the World
Bank, the African Development Bank and the African Economic
Research Consortium.

<HEADLINE> Local Media Must Remain in Local Hands: S'pore Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government
reiterated in a press release Monday that the country's media must
remain in local hands and there should be no foreign influence.
</P>
<P>
"It is for this reason that we have rules limiting any
individual shareholding to no more than three percent and
requiring board members of media companies to be mainly
Singaporeans," the press release said.
</P>
<P>
This is because local media have a unique nation-building role
in Singapore's multiracial and multireligious society and they
need to have a deep sense of responsibility and commitment to
Singapore, it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in his speech at the opening of the Digital TV
Seminar Monday, Minister for Information and the Arts Lee Yock
Suan announced that the Singapore government will retain the
present local media industry structure, with the Singapore Press
Holdings (SPH) as the core newspaper group and the Mediacorp as
the core broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
"Various options were considered, and the government decided
that under current circumstances, allowing SPH and Mediacorp to
compete with each other whilst encouraging them to move
aggressively into the Internet was the best option," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister also announced that the government is prepared to
issue SPH with broadcasting licenses to run up to two free-to-air
TV channels and up to two radio channels and to issue Mediacorp a
newspaper license in order to give scope for more direct
competition between SPH and Mediacorp and enrich their position as
content providers.

<HEADLINE> Digital Distribution Planned for Titan A.E. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A Hollywood movie will be
digitally distributed across the country and then projected to a
cinema audience, going from the studio in Hollywood to a theater
in Atlanta without ever touching film.
</P>
<P>
The announcement, made by 20th Century Fox and Cisco Systems,
is to demonstrate the potential of digital distribution, which
many believe will one day replace film, the New York Times
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Using Cisco's new technology, Fox's new animated feature, "
Titan A.E." will be hurled from West Communication's CyberCenter
in Burbank to the Woodruff Arts Center in Atlanta, where it will
be projected.
</P>
<P>
Digital projectors have been used occasionally in the last year
to exhibit a few films in a handful of theaters around the country,
and video images have been played across the Internet.
</P>
<P>
However, this will be the first time the two processes have
been combined in a demonstration of the kind of digital
distribution network.
</P>
<P>
It is still a question how long it might be before such digital
distribution is common. Two major issues have been slowing the
transition.
</P>
<P>
The first is the price. Cinema owners are reluctant to pay an
estimated 100,000 U.S. dollars per projector. The second issue is
the fear among many in Hollywood that once their films are loosed
upon the Internet, they will be subject to the same kinds of
piracy that have plagued the music industry in recent months.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Monday in a speech to the Russian parliament urged to establish
a Russian-American relationship of a new nature.
</P>
<P>
Russia has passed the phase of its dependence on external aid
and now it needs foreign investments, he said at the Russian State
Duma,the lower house of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The question America should ask is what it can do together with
Russia in the common interests, he noted. The Americans should
stop thinking that they have the answers to all questions and all
of the problems in Russia will cease to exist as soon as it sides
with the American points of view, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Russia will choose a policy that complies with its interests to
be shared by the people in a democratic way, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Another problem is that the majority of Russians suspect
America of not wishing good to their country, but that is not so,
he said. The Americans are interested in a strong Russia that
would be capable of upholding its territorial integrity and
development, he said.

BERLIN, June 5 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
left Berlin for Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, to make official
visits to the three Baltic states - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
It is the first visit of German Chancellor to the three Baltic
states.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder's predecessor Helmut Kohl reportedly had refused the
visit because of fear of offending Russia. But German President
Johannes Rau and his predecessor Roman Herzog had already made
visit to the three states.
</P>
<P>
During Schroeder's visit in the three states he will talk with
the leaders of the three states about the planned enlargement of
the European Union (EU)and the expansion of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO). The three Baltic states want to join
in the two organizations.
</P>
<P>
Germany plays an important role in the two organizations and
keeps the historical influence in the Baltic region. Now Germany
is the biggest trade partner of Latvia and Lithuania, at same time
the fourth largest one of Estonia. Many German businessmen
accompany Schroeder to visit the three states. All sides hope to
boost the economic and trade relations between Germany and the
three Baltic states.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Debt Estimated to Drop in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Canada's net debt is predicted to
drop to 568.8 billion Canadian dollars in 2000 (about 385.6
billion U.S. dollars), the country's Globe and Mail newspaper said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin as
saying that the federal government may post a surplus of at least
8 billion Canadian dollars (about 5.4 billion U.S. dollars) to
boost health and education spending while paying down national
debt.
</P>
<P>
Martin attributed the sound prediction to a bigger-than-
expected 1999-2000 surplus which means that the federal government
will have to allocate less of its spending to debt payments in
future years.
</P>
<P>
Canada's booming economy should also provide longer-term
support to the Canadian dollar, he said.

<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A number of Chinese provinces and
cities today published local environmental reports to mark the
World Environment Day, designated as the day to expose global
concerns about environmental pollution and honor the achievements
in environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen, which came first in the comprehensive assessment of
environment situation among 46 major cities in China last year,
today released a comprehensive environmental situation bulletin.
</P>
<P>
The city pooled 2.6 billion yuan for its environmental
protection programs in 1999, which accounted for 1.85 percent of
its GDP for the year, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen has set strict rules against pollution, which were put
into effect to deal with 831 cases of pollution violations last
year, the report says.
</P>
<P>
The city's environmental department has been given the power to
veto projects that pose environment threats. The right was
exercised to reject 892 of the total 9,564 new projects passed
last year in the coastal special economic zone.
</P>
<P>
The environmental report published by the Tibet Autonomous
Region today focuses on water quality. It says that the abundant
water reserve in the region has been well preserved. The region
boasts 448.2 billion cu m of surface water and 110.7 billion cu m
of ground water.
</P>
<P>
However, the report warns that urbanization has produced an
increase of residential sewage discharge, which added up to 49.8
million tons last year. It also points out that industrial sewage
discharge lessened due to improved disposal technology.
</P>
<P>
East China's Jiangxi Province today released its environmental
situation bulletin for the year 1999, in which it announces its
better air quality but worsening the acid rain problem.

water from the western part of the city.
</P>
<P>
The project is a part of the second-phase sewage disposal
program in Shanghai, which will have a total investment of 6.3
billion yuan (759 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The pipeline in the Pudong section will connect with a 130-km
long pipe, which was laid at the end of last year, running from
two industrial parks in the southwest and southern parts of the
city to a sewer treatment plant in Pudong.
</P>
<P>
All the sewage is piped to a disposal plant built at the mouth
of Yangtze River, which has a daily handling capacity of 1.7

BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists today sent up
the country's first ozone exploration balloon on the northern
slope of Mount Qomolangma, better known in the West as Mt. Everest,
to detect the ozone density around the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in
summer.
</P>
<P>
When the grey balloon reached an altitude of 20-30 km above the
ground surface, a sensor attached to the balloon began to transmit
scientific data, which will aid the study of ozone distribution in
the atmosphere of the plateau.

<P>
The ozone content in the region is about 10 percent less than
in surrounding areas. According to scientific surveys, a drop in
ozone density occurs at the plateau between June and September
every year.

He said that his meeting with Mubarak was cordial, fruitful and

<P>
RIYADH, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia is currently reviewing
the situation in world oil market with regard to prices, supply and
demand, crude reserves and derivatives, said Minister of Petroleum
and Mineral Resources Ali Ibrahim al-N'aimi.
</P>
<P>
The review aimed to strike a balance between supply and demand
in world oil market, maintain the stability of prices to the
benefits of both producers and consumers, ensure a reasonable
revenue for oil producers and the oil industry in general, and
reduce possible  impacts to be inflicted by oil on world economy,
Saudi Press Agency quoted the minister as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom, in cooperation with other producers, will take the
necessary steps to bring down the rising oil prices to a reasonable
level, stressed the minister of the world's largest oil producer.
</P>
<P>
Member states of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC), excluding Iraq, agreed in March to increase their
daily oil output by 1.7 million barrels as of April 1 to stabilize
the oil prices that had risen to a nine-year high of more than 30
U.S. dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
OPEC, which dominates 42 percent of the world oil market, groups
Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
The price of the North Sea Brent crude surged on Friday above
the 29-U.S.-dollar per barrel ceiling in London while the price of
the light reference in New York spiralled over 30 dollars per
barrel.
</P>
<P>
Many OPEC members announced recently that they might
automatically boost their production in accordance with the
mechanism adopted in their March meeting.
</P>
<P>
OPEC oil ministers will hold an extraordinary meeting on June
21 in Vienna to review the effects of the oil production hike.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's largest
telecommunication company Telekom Malaysia Bhd announced Monday
that it will rationalize its cellular phone network operations.
</P>
<P>
The company has allocated 800 million ringgit (210.526 million
U.S. dollars) for the rationalization plan under which Telekom
Malaysia would increase the coverage of one desired network, its
newly appointed Chief Executive Officer Mohd Khir Abdul Rahman
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mohd Khir, however, did not say whether there would be a merger
between the existing two cellular networks, namely, the 018
Mobikom network and the 013 TM Touch network, or whether one would
be phased out.
</P>
<P>
TM Touch is currently more popular with its subscribers
reaching 233,000 people in 1999, while Mobikom has 142,000
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
Mohd Khir said for Telekom now, the priority is to put in more
effort to clean the cellular network by way of improving its
operations and services.
</P>
<P>
He expected the cellular phone subscriber base to increase by
between 15 and 20 percent within the next two to three years from
its current level.
</P>
<P>
Telekom has been very strong in fixed line telephony with a 98
percent market share, with a subscriber base of about 4.3 million
people at the end of 1999 in the fixed line area.

Planting a sapling in Manali city of north India's Himachal
Pradesh state to observe World Environment Day Monday, Vajpayee
said adequate steps are needed to protect the environment from
destruction caused by unplanned development that did not take into
account long-term impact.
</P>
<P>
"In our country, the increasing stress on natural resources is
reflected in the form of polluted air, contaminated water, health
problems, diminishing forests and extinction of numerous species
of flora and fauna," said Vajpayee in a message to the nation. "It
is also reflected in the form of drought and floods."
</P>
<P>
He said environment and ecological conservation have to be the
common thread linking national policies, plans and programs,
adding that his government is committed to ensuring sustainable
development and improving quality of life of people through proper
environmental and natural resource management.
</P>
<P>
"But government alone cannot accomplish the task," he noted. "
We need the active participation and cooperation of individuals,
community organizations, voluntary groups and industry."
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, the central government of India announced at a
World Environment Day function in New Delhi that it had decided to
hike by 15 to 25 percent funds for soil and water conservation
measures in new afforestation projects in the desert and drought-
prone areas, the PTI reported.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Urges Deployment of West African Peacekeeping Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone has demanded immediate
deployment of the 3,000-strong West African Peacekeeping Forces
(ECOMOG) pledged by the regional leaders last week, local press
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone's High Commissioner (ambassador) to Nigeria Joe
Blell said on Sunday in the Nigerian capital Abuja that the
troops' timely deployment would forestall the continued violation
of the Lome peace agreement by the Revolutionary United Front
(RUF) rebels.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) agreed to provide the additional troops to reinforce the
U.N. peacekeeping forces which have been deployed in Sierra Leone
since April to oversee the disarmament and demobilization of about
45,000 rebels under the Lome peace accord signed last July.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after the RUF rebels who refused to hand
over weapons took about 500 U.N. peacekeepers hostage in early
May, pushing the war-torn west African country back on the brink
of all-out civil war.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, Ghana and Mali have already sent a total of six
battalions to the U.N. mission in that country.
</P>
<P>
The envoy denied that the arrested RUF leader Foday Sankoh
would be flown to another country for security reason.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the position of his government that the rebel
leader would be tried "at some point in time" and in line with the
laws of that country.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Launches National Environmental Education Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 5 (Xinhua) -- South African Education
Ministry on Monday unveiled in Pretoria the National
Environmental Education Program, including a drive to create
"green" schools.
</P>
<P>
"Some schools are themselves a blot on the landscape rather
than a credit to the environment," Education Minister Kader
Asmal's adviser Razeena Wagiet said.
</P>
<P>
He noted the Green Schools program is broader than just
planting trees. It is about creating a healthy school
environment, which comprises not only the natural aspect, but
also the political, social and economic environment.
</P>
<P>
"Green Flag" awards will be given annually to schools that have
made progress in certain areas, including school grounds and
fieldwork, environmental information and community knowledge,
clubs and cultural activities, action projects and environmental
competitions.
</P>
<P>
"The project is about better school management with a focus on
the environment," Wagiet said.
</P>
<P>
He added with imminent redesigning of the school curriculum
that a strong emphasis will be placed on the environment.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Government Warns Companies Against Political Closures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has issued
a strong warning Monday of dire consequences to companies
allegedly closing down deliberately to cause economic chaos in
the run-up to the June 24 and 25 parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister of the Industry and Commerce Ministry Obert
Mpofu said his ministry was compiling names of companies where
mostly white managers had cut down whole or sections of
production to create commodity shortages that could result in
panic consumerism.
</P>
<P>
Some of the managers were reportedly sending workers on forced
unpaid leave and telling them that if they vote for the
opposition, they would get their jobs back. But if they returned
the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front
(Zanu-pf) to power they would suffer job losses.
</P>
<P>
"We have received a lot of reports," said Mpofu without
elaborating.  " We are taking stock and compiling the names.
When we come back into power we will not hesitate to help workers
to buy those companies."
</P>
<P>
Mpofu's warning was coming at a time when many workers across
the entire economy had been reporting incidents that bosses sent
them on indefinite leave or dismissed them completely.
</P>
<P>
They were telling the workers that they were being forced to
close businesses because of the plunder of the economy by
Zanu-pf.
</P>
<P>
White bosses in particular were said to be closing temporarily
to go on "holiday" abroad as they anticipated violence and
property destruction during the elections.
</P>
<P>
Police and travel agencies reported that on a daily basis more
than 100 white families apply to leave the country just before
the elections.
</P>
<P>
Mpofu blamed opposition leaders who de-campaigned the local
economy to the point of calling for sanctions against Zimbabwe.

ROME, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin
arrived here Monday afternoon at the start of a two-day visit to
Italy.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Putin, who has just concluded talks with U.S.
President Bill Clinton in Moscow, is likely to discuss with
Italian Premier Giuliano Amato the issues of U.S. plans for an
anti-missile defense system, conditions in the Balkans and
Chechnya and bilateral economic and industrial agreements.
</P>
<P>
Italy, because of its geographic position, is greatly concerned
about missile programs pursued by some countries for the
development of medium and long range missiles which could
represent a threat to the national security of others.
</P>
<P>
Amato said earlier that arms issues would be one of the items
on the agenda for talks with Putin.
</P>
<P>
On his two-day visit, Putin will also meet Italian President
Carlo Azeglio Ciampi and travel to the Vatican for an audience
with Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
After a visit to London in mid-April for talks with British
Prime Minister Tony Blair, Putin's visit here will mark his first
official trip abroad since his inauguration on May 7.
</P>
<P>
Putin will continue on to Spain and Germany after his visit to
Italy.

<HEADLINE> Coach Ma Doubtful of Olympic Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINZHOU, Northeast China, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Legendary Chinese
coach Ma Junren said here on Monday that he was not confident of
his runners winning any gold medal at the Sydney Olympic Games in
September.
</P>
<P>
Ma, who stunned the world by leading his long-distance women
runners to three gold medals in the Stuttgart world championships
in 1993, has not appeared in international arena for about two
years.
</P>
<P>
"I know the whole country expect us to win a gold medal at
Olympics, but this is very difficult," said Ma, who is here to
compete for the national Olympic athletics trials set for June 7-8.
</P>
<P>
"The reason is very clear," Ma said. "Firstly, our runners were
out of practice for about two years from 1998 to 1999. We just
resumed systematic training last summer. Secondly, quite a few
talented runners in the west have emerged during this period.
They are more experienced and will pose serious threat to us in
the Olympics."
</P>
<P>
Ma added: "Almost all my runners are plagued with injuries.
Jiang Bo had to pull out of the Olympic trials because of a knee
injury."
</P>
<P>
Jiang set a new world record in women's 5,000 meters event by
clocking 14 minutes 28.09 seconds in the China's Eighth National
Games in 1997 in Shanghai.

SHENZHEN, June 5 (Xinhua) -- China held an inter-regional
marine emergency exercise near the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone
today.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Calls for Technological Innovation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin today
urged a conference of scholars here to launch a new wave of
scientific and technological progress and innovation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said efforts should be increased to carry out the
strategy of revitalizing China by relying on science and education
and sustainable development, build an innovation system, promote
scientific and technological innovation and knowledge renewal,
speed up industrialization of new and high technology, accelerate
reforms of the existing scientific system and apply research
results into production in the shortest possible time.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks at the Conference of the Chinese Academy
of Sciences (CAS) and the Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE)
held today in the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
People in the scientific and technological circles should carry
forward the spirit of science. A spirit of seeking truth from
facts and adventure will be advocated in all trades, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"A breakthrough has been made in science and technology around
the globe. Modern science characterized by information and life
science is advancing by leaps and bounds. We are confronted with
rare development opportunities and grave challenges. Under the
circumstance of multi-polarization and economic globalization,
China must accelerate scientific progress and innovation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The role of scientists is very important in scientific and
technological development, he added, stressing that the essence of
science is innovation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang urged Chinese scientists to follow the world trend,
firmly grasp key scientific issues which are of strategic
importance to China's economic, scientific and defense development,
and rely on their own best instincts.
</P>
<P>
The most important thing in persisting in Marxism is to adhere
to the scientific principle and spirit of Marxism, be skilled at
discovering new things as conditions change, and gain useful
experience, he said.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials, especially high-ranking officials, should
take the lead in studying scientific knowledge and apply it in
their daily work. The officials should listen to the opinions and
suggestions of scientists and engineers and take their opinions as
reference before they make decisions on scientific and technical
issues, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Scientific development requires training of a large contingent
of young technical personnel, and leading officials should create
favorable conditions for them, he added.

<HEADLINE> China Curbs Worsening of Environment (More Added) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- China has prevented its natural
environment from getting any worse, and the environmental
situation in some parts of the country has improved, according to
an official report released here today.
</P>
<P>
However, the China Environmental Situation Bulletin 1999 warned
that the overall environmental situation in China remains serious,
as the total volume of pollutants discharged across the country
continues to be too high.
</P>
<P>
The bulletin, released here today by the State Environmental
Protection Administration (SEPA), gives facts and figures on the
current state of China's water, ocean, air, noise, solid
industrial waste, radiation, land resources, biodiversity, climate
change and natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
The report says that in 1999 the Chinese government increased
spending on the urban infrastructure construction and
environmental protection and worked to prevent pollution and
protect the ecology.
</P>
<P>
"The total pollutant discharge amount was controlled
effectively," says the official report.
</P>
<P>
China increased its national debts by 60 billion yuan (7.2
billion U.S. dollars) last year and 23.1 percent of the amount was
put into environmental projects, including construction of natural
gas and urban sewage treatment facilities, and control of
pollution of major rivers and lakes.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the discharge amount of sulfur dioxide,
and smoke and dust in China reduced 10 and 20 percent respectively
over 1998.
</P>
<P>
Unleaded gasoline accounted for over 70 percent of the total
gasoline consumption in the country. But the total discharge
amount of the industrial and urban sewage in the whole country was
40.1 billion tons, 600 million tons more than in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The report points out that most rivers in the country are
contaminated. The pollution in the Liao River and the Hai River is
serious, and the water quality in the Huai River is bad. The water
quality in the Yellow River is worrisome. Only the Songhua River,
Pearl River and Yangtze River were reported to be in good
condition. The spread of oxygen-eating algae in the Tai, Dian and
Chao lakes is serious.
</P>
<P>
Among the 47 major cities, only 16 passed the national standard
for air quality and 20 passed the ground water quality standard.

a question at a press conference hosted by the State Information
Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Some developed countries have been asking developing countries
like China to make the same substantial cut in greenhouse gas
emission as required of developed countries by international
conventions or protocols.
</P>
<P>
Xie also called on the developed countries to honor their
commitments and international obligations, such as those made at
the world's first Earth Summit in Brazil in the early 1990s and
greenhouse gas emission targets for developed countries as listed
in the Kyoto Protocol, in a bid to help developing countries in
environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
He said that China and Britain agree that developed countries
should fulfill their obligations to global greenhouse gas
reduction and global environmental cooperation between the rich
and the poor countries.
</P>
<P>
The SEPA director said China has made great efforts to cut the
gas emission by improving its energy consumption mix and
encouraging the use of renewable and clean energy.

<HEADLINE> China Will Not Meet Undue Greenhouse Gas Reduction Standards: Official (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China has shut down 33,000 coal mines in the past few years,
reducing the country's annual coal output by 280 million tons, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Efforts have been stepped up to develop water power resources
in southwest China, and the Three Gorges project on the Yangtze
River is progressing smoothly, Xie said.
</P>
<P>
The project's power station has a designed capacity to produce
as much power as the burning of 50 million tons of coal each year.
</P>
<P>
Progress has been made in the use of wind power resources in
the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in north China and the
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in the northwest, as well as in
the exploitation of solar energy in western China. Research is
underway to use tidal waves along the country's eastern coast to
produce power.
</P>
<P>
China is also working on at least two new nuclear power
stations aimed to increase its nuclear energy output and to
optimize its energy mix, which now is heavily dependent on coal
consumption, he added.
</P>
<P>
"In rural China, efforts have been made to encourage the use of
organic resources to produce environment-friendly methane for
cooking and lighting," Xie said.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing large-scale program to return farmland to grassland,
lakes, and forests, and the ambitious plan to double China's land
covered by forest in the coming three or four decades will also
help reduce the greenhouse gas emission, Xie said.

<HEADLINE> Nanometric Technology to Become Hot Scientific Field in 21st Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Nanometric technology will become
one of the most important scientific fields in the 21st century,
along with information and biology technology, a foreign
academician with the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) said today.
</P>
<P>
This new technology, which is closely related to physics,
chemistry, material science and biological engineering, has huge
potential in application, and Western developed countries
including the United States are investing big money to develop it,
said Prof. Chang-Lin Tien, a Chinese-American scientist.
</P>
<P>
One nanometer is only 1/1,000,000,000 of a meter. However, the
nanometric technology will lead to important developments in
clinical medicine, computer hardware, environmental protection and
other fields.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Tien said that the nanometric research in China is still
in a preliminary stage, but Chinese scientists have already made
some achievements in the field.
</P>
<P>
Researchers with the Physics Institute under the CAS have
succeed in developing the longest and thinnest carbon nanotubes
during the past two years. A medical high-tech company in the
eastern China city of Nanjing has developed a super anti-bacteria
cotton fabric using the nanometric techniques.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Tien, who was elected to be in the first group of CAS'
foreign academicians in 1994, has been actively involved in
academic activities in China and has made contributions in
promoting the country's international exchanges in science and
technology.

<HEADLINE> Five Israelis Sentenced in Maccabiah Disaster Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Five Israelis were sentenced
Monday to a 21-month imprisonment or community services for their
negligence which led to a bridge collapse during the Maccabiah
Games in Israel three years ago.
</P>
<P>
The tragedy took place on the occasion of the opening ceremony
of the 15th Maccabiah Games, or the Jewish Olympics, on July 14,
1997, in which four Australian Jewish athletes were killed and
nearly seventy injured. 
</P>
<P>
When the Australians were crossing a temporary footbridge over
the Yarkon River into the Ramat Gan stadium near Tel Aviv, the
bridge collapsed and about 100 people were plunged into the
polluted river.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Tel Aviv Magistrate's court Monday sentenced Micha Bar-
Ilan, the engineer who designed the bridge, to one year and nine
months in prison, with a 21-month suspended sentence.
</P>
<P>
It was established during the trial that Bar-Ilan did not take
actions when learning that hundreds of persons would be on the
bridge even though its design could only accommodate 100 persons.
</P>
<P>
Two sub-contractors Yehoshua Ben Ezra and Baruch Kegula were
sentenced to 15 months and a two-year suspended sentence, according
to the court's verdict.
</P>
<P>
Adam Mishori, the manager of the Irgunit company which supplied
materials for the bridge, was sentenced to nine months in prison
with a 15-month suspended sentence as well.
</P>
<P>
Yoram Eyal, head of the Games' organizing committee, was ordered
to accomplish six-month community services.
</P>
<P>
All the defendants, except Eyal, had appealed to the Tel Aviv
District Court. Their lawyers had asked the court to put off their
client's sentence until the appeal procedure finished.
</P>
<P>
The five, who played key organizational roles in the games, were
convicted in April of causing death and injuries by negligence. All
had faced a maximum prison term of four years.
</P>
<P>
The Magistrate's Court judges stated Monday that the sentences
were intended to serve as a deterrent to prevent such negligence
and lack of responsibility in the future.
</P>
<P>
However, Colin Elterman, whose daughter Sasha was among the
victims and is still undergoing medical treatments for her injuries
from that day, expressed his angry and disappointment over the
verdict.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Israel Radio on the telephone from Australia,
Elterman said: "It's an absolute disgrace. The minimum sentence in
Australia for a crime like this...would have been four years in
jail."
</P>
<P>
He also called on Israelis to boycott the next Maccabiah Games
and commercial sponsors supporting the games.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the court rejected the prosecutor's claims that the
five defendants should compensate the victims as the matter is
being addressed in a separate civil suit, which already opened at
the Haifa District Court on May 23.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-three victims of the Maccabiah bridge disaster are seeking
compensation for their injuries, which could result in more than
one million U.S. dollars in compensation for the plaintiffs.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Lower Medicine Prices With Imports From China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Monday that it expects medicine prices in the country to go even
lower with the expected import of pharmaceutical products from
China.
</P>
<P>
Trade Secretary Manuel Roxas said in a radio speech that the
import of medicines should provide competition to the foreign
pharmaceutical firms operating here.
</P>
<P>
Roxas said this is in line with President Joseph Estrada's
order to the concerned government agencies to pursue measures
designed to bring down prices of medicines.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the plan to import medicines from
China came following the president's state visit to China in May.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Estrada had noted that prices of medicines in the
Philippines are 10 times those in other Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Health had also noted that at least seven
pharmaceutical firms were committed to lowering prices of some of
their products.
</P>
<P>
Health Secretary Alberto Romualdez said that at least one firm
has been carrying out programs to make less expensive versions of
its products.

KUALA LUMPUR, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian Rhino Trust Fund
(MRTF) was launched Monday with the main objective of generating
income for rhinoceros conservation efforts in the country.
</P>
<P>
The fund, launched by the Pacific Asia Tourism Association(PATA)
Malaysia Chapter, will also serve as an awareness campaign to the
public, officials said at the launch held in the northwestern
state of Pulau Pinang, according to Bernama news agency.
</P>
<P>
The amount of the fund was however not announced.
</P>
<P>
The public, especially schoolchildren, are taught the
importance of nature and the rhinoceros is used as the flagship
species to emphasize the importance of the ecosystem, said Hadi
Mohamad, veterinary officer of the Rhino Conservation Center (RCC)
which will be used as a living classroom for the students to have
hands-on experience on what they have learned.
</P>
<P>
The center uses the "gene-pool" concept whereby the animals
were released into their natural habitat to allow them to breed on
their own.

<HEADLINE> Earthquake Death Toll Reaches 58 in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A strong earthquake measuring 7.9
on the Richter Scale and scores of aftershocks rocked Bengkulu in
the Indonesian island of Sumatra, killing at least 58 people and
leaving more than 200 injured, according to latest reports
reaching here Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Antara News Agency quoted police in Bengkulu as saying that
the death toll is likely to rise considering the magnitude of the
quake.
</P>
<P>
"So far we have received a report of 58 people dead and more
than 200 people injured from the whole of the province. But the
death toll is likely to be higher because we have not been able to
contact the worst-hit area, which is the South Bengkulu district,"
Sergeant Edy Somes was quoted by the reports as saying.
</P>
<P>
Antara reported that most of the wounded people were laid on
the corridors of the hospitals in Bengkulu because they do not
have enough rooms for all the victims.
</P>
<P>
Wounded people screamed as doctors performed operations on them
because there was not enough anesthesia. Hospitals reported they
were running out of blood and medicine as they tried to cope with
the flood of injured.
</P>
<P>
"Relief aid for the earthquake victims in Bengkulu will be sent
immediately and the technical aspects are currently being
discussed by the ministry of health and welfare," President
Abdurrahman Wahid told a press conference here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Rescue efforts were being hampered by the lack of electricity,
which had been knocked out by the tremor. Water supply had also
been cut and public transport disrupted. Bengkulu airport stopped
operations and the navigational system and power generators there
were said to have been damaged.
</P>
<P>
Bengkulu Governor Hasan Zein told state television that most
houses on Enggano island, which lies close to the earthquake's
epicenter and is home to 1,500 people, had been flattened.
</P>
<P>
Telephone lines to Enggano and other remote parts of the
province have been severed.
</P>
<P>
Head of the local Meteorological and Geophysics Office Armin
Paimin said the epicenter of the quake was located 112 kilometers
from Bengkulu off the west coast of Sumatra, and 200 aftershocks
were recorded following the earthquake.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake also sparked panic in the Sumatran cities of
Jambi, Padang, Palembang and Lampung, although there was no report
of casualties there.
</P>
<P>
The quake was also felt as far away as in Jakarta, 536
kilometers southeast of the epicenter.
</P>
<P>
Armin said Bengkulu, which sits on an earthquake zone, is
shaken by light tremors almost every day.
</P>
<P>
A strong earthquake measuring 6 on the Richter Scale shook
Bengkulu on December 15, 1978, leaving one dead.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is prone to earthquakes as it is situated at the
Pacific "Ring of Fire," a string of volcanoes and earthquake zones
that stretch from Mexico to New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The worst earthquake to hit Indonesia in the last decade
occurred in December 1992, when a magnitude 7 earthquake and a
tsunami killed 2,200 persons on Flores island in eastern part of
the country.

<HEADLINE> Kumaratunga Rules Out Unconditional Talks With Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has ruled out the possibility of holding "
unconditional" talks with the Tamil Tiger rebels who seem to be on
the defensive after a fierce offensive over the past two months in
the northern Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
In a BBC interview which went on air on Monday, Kumaratunga
said, "previously, there were no conditions except for a limited
time frame."
</P>
<P>
She said, "for six years we have tried to talk to them and for
six years they have lied (that) they are going to talk, and up to
date, they have refused. Now there is no question of talking
unless certain conditions are fulfilled."
</P>
<P>
However, the president did not spell out what the conditions
for the talks would be. She only said they would have to be
considered when the time came.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga said the government had direct contacts with the
separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) through the
Norwegian government which is acting as a facilitator to bring
both parties to the peace negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
She also indicated that there was "a clear operational plan" to
recapture the areas of the Jaffna peninsula that the army had lost
to the LTTE, but said she would not venture to mention a time
frame for the operation.
</P>
<P>
The president said she will press ahead with her new
constitution aimed at ending the 17-year civil war with or without
the participation of the LTTE rebels who have been fighting for a
separate state for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been engaged in a ferocious assault over
the past two months in a bid to retake their former stronghold of
Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
However, only sporadic fighting has been reported for the past
week as the government has rushed new weapons and reinforcements
to Jaffna to beef up the defenses.
</P>
<P>
A defense ministry spokesman said the LTTE rebels might be
trying to regroup after having lost an estimated 200 to 250
fighters in the past fortnight.

<HEADLINE> China Raises Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to raise the
prices of manufactured oil for the domestic market in a move to
attune its oil pricing to the global market.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Planning Commission allowed the producer
prices of gasoline and diesel oil to rise by 300 yuan and 100 yuan
per ton, respectively, in a directive released on June 1.
</P>
<P>
The China National Petroleum Corporation and China National
Petrochemical Corporation can decide their own retail prices based
on the government-set base, with the floating margin of five
percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the directive, a new oil pricing formation
mechanism under government regulation can better reflect the
supply-demand relations, meet the needs of the growing national
economy and ensure stable supply to domestic consumers.
</P>
<P>
China has become a net petroleum importer since 1993 and its
oil imports are on the rise. Last year, imported petroleum
accounted for 20 percent of the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Echoing the price rise in the international petroleum market,
China began to increase its oil price from last November.
Observers noted that the latest upward adjustment is still lower
than the price level on the world market, leaving room for further
price rise.
</P>
<P>
However, to maintain order in the domestic market, the
directive asked pricing departments at all levels to take
consumers' financial conditions into full consideration. Local
governments must keep an eye on the prices of oil products, the
directive said.
</P>
<P>
Whoever raise the oil price at will or in any disguised form
will be severely punished according to the Price Law, it added.
</P>
<P>
From now on, companies engaged in oil production and
distribution should do their best to provide sufficient oil
products and meet the demand of domestic consumers, it said.

<HEADLINE> China to Step Up Fight Against Agriculture Pollution (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- China is preparing to fight the
country's worsening agricultural environment so that sustained
developments in rural areas can become a reality, Vice-minister of
Agriculture Zhang Baowen said here today.
</P>
<P>
In a symposium to mark the World Environment Day today, Zhang
said that China has made many noteworthy achievements in
safeguarding its agricultural environment, but it still has a long
way to go to stop the ongoing deterioration caused by industrial
pollution.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than 130,000 hectares of farmland
have been damaged by industrial solid waste, and over 5.3 million
hectares of land are affected by air pollution.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the acreage of farmland irrigated with polluted
water is also growing. To date, 7.3 percent of the country's
irrigated farmland was harmed by polluted water, a jump of 1.6
times over the figure in the 1980s, and 93 million hectares of
farmland were polluted by pesticides.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey of agriculture markets in some provincial
capital cities shows that the residue of pesticide on vegetables
and fruit were above normal standard, and in some markets, the
phenomena is extremely serious.
</P>
<P>
Due to over-development, large areas of the country's grassland
and farmland are turning into sandy land. The acreage of desert
land in China has reached 2.62 million square kilometers and is
expanding at a speed of more than 2,400 square kilometers each
year.

<P>
Zhang said that to prevent the agriculture environment from
worsening, laws and regulations must be formulated, adding that
the ministry is working with other government departments to draft
the Regulations on Agriculture Environment Protection and revise
the Law on Grassland.
</P>
<P>
China also will improve its monitoring system for farmland,
fishing waters and grassland to prevent possible pollution, and
will develop bases to produce grain and vegetables that are
pollution-free, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Facts have proved that ecological agriculture is an effective
way to realize a coordinated development of the environment and
rural economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that China is working to expand the number of its
ecological agriculture counties to 300 from the current 200 by
2010, which will cover 20 million hectares of farmland.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will also be made to improve the condition of grassland,
and by 2010, the acreage of improved grassland will reach 60
million hectares, accounting for 15 percent of the country's total.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan's Denial of Consensus Shows Lack of Sincerity (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- China's Xinhua News Agency released
a bylined article today making clear that Taiwan's denial of the
one-China consensus reached between two organizations formed to
promote cross-Straits relations shows the Taiwan authorities have
no sincere desire to hold dialogue on reunification with the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the mainland's Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits (ARATS) and Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation (
SEF) reached consensus that the two sides would express, in their
own way, that "the two sides of the Straits both adhere to the one
China principle."
</P>
<P>
The recent statement issued by the Taiwan Work Office of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the
Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council said that as long as
the Taiwan authorities make a clear commitment that they will not
accept the "two-states remarks," and that they will adhere to the
consensus, the mainland will authorize ARATS to hold dialogues
with organizations or persons authorized by the Taiwan side.
</P>
<P>
The statement fully demonstrates the mainland's sincerity for
improving the cross-Straits relations and reopening the channel of
communication between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits, the
article stressed.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, some people in charge of Taiwan's mainland
affairs have flatly denied the consensus reached by ARATS and SEF,
while the new leader of Taiwan has purposely avoided the one China
principle, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The denial of the consensus is not only inconsistent with
historic facts, but also is a rebuff of the mainland's generosity.

<TEXT>
<P>
It's now become perfectly clear that the Taiwan authorities
aren't sincere about improving the cross-Straits relations and
conducting dialogue with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The article related that in November 1992, ARATS and SEF
reached the consensus and issued an oral statement that both sides
of the Taiwan Straits adhere to the one China principle.
</P>
<P>
And in its document to ARATS, SEF said that in the joint
pursuit of the country's reunification, the two sides should
adhere to the one China principle in spite of their different
understandings of what "one China" is.
</P>
<P>
The stance was widely reported by the media.
</P>
<P>
ARATS noted that both sides of the Taiwan Straits should abide
by the one China principle, both should seek the country's
reunification, and that the routine negotiations between the two
organizations will not involve the political connotations of one
China.
</P>
<P>
Despite their differences at the time, the spirit of the ARATS
and SEF consensus was that both sides of the Taiwan Straits should
adhere to the one China principle, the article said.
</P>
<P>
For years, the mainland has taken an unwavering attitude toward
the one China principle, and the Taiwan authorities have also
stated the one China principle in many of their official documents,
including statements that there is only one China in the world,
and that both the mainland and Taiwan belong to the Chinese
territory.

<P>
The Xinhua article stressed that that it was only because of
the consensus that a series of negotiations became possible
between the two sides of the Straits, including the talks between
the heads of ARATS and SEF.
</P>
<P>
It's inconceivable that some people participating in the
negotiations could publicly deny the existing basis for the
negotiations. By doing so, they have not only obliterated the
achievements of the negotiations, but also surrendered the
rightful stand of the ARATS and SEF consensus, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities should abandon the separatist stance of
the "two states remarks" and accept the consensus that both sides
of the Taiwan Straits adhere to the one China principle, now that
the new leader has said the abolition of the "National
Reunification Council" or the "National Reunification Guidelines"
will not be an issue and leading officials said the spirit of
reunification still exists.
</P>
<P>
Outright denial of the one China promise and attempts to
undermine the basis of the cross-Straits negotiations will not
only make any improvements in the cross-Straits relationship
impossible in the foreseeable future, but also create new problems
for the stability of the cross-Straits situation, the article
noted.

<HEADLINE> Polluting Firms Facing Shut Down: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Some 7,000 polluting firms will be
closed if they fail to meet the official pollutant discharge
requirements by the end of this year, China's top environmental
authority warned here today.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenhua, director of the State Environmental Protection
Administration (SEPA), issued the ultimatum at a press conference
held by the Information Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government decided in 1996 that all polluting firms
must meet pollutant discharge standards by the end of 2000 in
order to halt the worsening environmental deterioration.
</P>
<P>
Xie said that as of the end of April, 85 percent of the
polluting industrial firms monitored by the central government had
met the requirements.
</P>
<P>
But more than 7,300 small and medium-sized plants and 491 large
factories have taken no measures to control their waste discharge.
</P>
<P>
China has closed over 65,000 polluting firms, mostly small ones,
over the past three years to protect the environment and save
natural resources. Replacing outdated technology and adding new
equipment are strategies China has encouraged large firms to adopt.
</P>
<P>
SEPA will work with legislative organs to keep a close watch on
the polluting firms, the director added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Specialists in the engineering
circle are today urged to make greater contributions to China's
economy by providing professional consultation services to
decision makers and enterprise managers.
</P>
<P>
Song Jian, president of the Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE)
, said the CAE has decided to set up a special committee to boost
links among research institutes, enterprises and industrial
departments, and to help enterprises enhance innovation capability.
</P>
<P>
"China cannot become an economic giant without overwhelming
strength in its engineering technology and manufacturing," Song
said at the fifth conference of CAE academicians, which began here
today.
</P>
<P>
As a leading consultative body, the 544-academician CAE is now
focusing on providing consultative services to major policy makers
and project heads.
</P>
<P>
The academicians have made contributions over the past two
years in many fields, such as development of high-speed trains,
aero industry, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and metallurgy, Song
said.
</P>
<P>
Some of them were invited to help some large state-owned
enterprises re-structure their development strategy while
conducting technological innovation, and that will be continued in
the future, he noted.

<HEADLINE> China's Major Rivers, Lakes Remain Polluted: Bulletin (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- China said today most of its major
rivers and lakes remained seriously polluted last year despite a
nationwide campaign to cut water pollution in the past years.
</P>
<P>
To curb the worsening water pollution, China has closed tens
of thousands of small and medium-sized polluting firms in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
In a bulletin issued today on China's environmental situation
in 1999, the State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA)
said serious water pollution is common in the country's major
rivers.
</P>
<P>
Of China's seven major rivers, the Liaohe River in the
northeast and the Haihe River in the north are seriously polluted,
and the Huaihe River in the east is in poor condition, the
bulletin said.
</P>
<P>
And the quality of water in northern China's Yellow River, the
country's second longest, is worsening, it said, adding that the
Yellow River was affected by both a water shortage and water
pollution last year.
</P>
<P>
It said the river dried up for a total of 42 days last year,
95 days less than in 1998, while water rated as Class V or Class V+
-- the highest level of pollution -- was found in 63 percent of
the water sampled from 114 different spots.

<P>
The quality of water in the Songhua River in northeast China is
fairly good, while that of the Pearl River in south China, with
the exception of the section of Guangzhou, and of the Yangtze
River, is generally good, it said.
</P>
<P>
Serious pollution remains in the three major lakes in China,
with Class V or Class V+ water accounting for half of the sampled
water.
</P>
<P>
The three lakes are Taihu Lake near Shanghai, Dianchi Lake in
southwest China's Yunnan Province, and Chaohu Lake in east China's
Anhui Province, the bulletin said.
</P>
<P>
The outlook for the Liaohe River is much worse, where 70
percent of the sampled water from 52 water quality monitoring
stations is classified as Class V+, according to the bulletin.
</P>
<P>
China discharged a total of 40.1 billion tons of waste water
last year, up from 39.5 billion tons in the previous year, while
the chemical oxygen demand (COD) materials it contained decreased
by 7.2 percent over the previous year to 13.8 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The COD materials deplete oxygen in the water, thus harming
marine life.
</P>
<P>
It said 87 percent of the industrial waste water discharged by
major polluting township enterprises and firms at the country
level or above is treated, while 66 percent of the discharged
water was up to the discharge standards set by the state and local
governments.

<HEADLINE> Possible Early Election Causes Tension Among Turkish Cabinet Partners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The decision by deputies of the
ruling partner Nationalist Action Party (MHP) to file a corruption
charge against Mesut Yilmaz, leader of another coalition partner
Motherland Party (ANAP), to the Supreme Court highlighted a serious
crisis in the tripartite cabinet led by Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of an early election was a major factor in the
decision by the MHP deputies, who serve in the parliamentary
commission investigating allegations about the former prime
minister's graft in selling a state-owned plot, Turkish Daily News
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of an early election emerged as the
Constitutional Court is about to decide in October whether the pro-
Islamic opposition Virtue Party (FP) is the successor to the banned
Islamic Welfare Party.
</P>
<P>
If the court makes a "yes" verdict, the FP will be closed and 70
of the 103 FP deputies in the parliament will be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
According to the Constitution, if 5 percent (about 28) of the
550-member parliament are absent, the country should be forced into
an early parliament election within three months.
</P>
<P>
Due to the recent crisis, Yilmaz had to postpone his intention
of serving as a deputy prime minister in the government set up by
the Ecevit-led Democratic Left Party (DSP), the MHP and ANAP in
last May. In his reaction, Yilmaz directed harsh statements of
mistrust toward the MHP, threatening to withdraw from the cabinet
if the decision against him is approved by the full parliament.
</P>
<P>
In response, MHP leader and Deputy Prime Minister Devlet Bahceli
said that the actions of government and parliament are two
different missions and must not affect each other.
</P>
<P>
It was speculated that the MHP and the ANAP are trying to taint
the reputation of each other as part of their election strategy as
the ANAP is eyeing for the nationalist and conservative votes,
which the MHP is also wooing, in the absence of the FP.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said the corruption allegations against Yilmaz
will be on the agenda of the Supreme Court, which will prevent the
ANAP leader from having a place in the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Due to the parliament's heavy agenda, it seems unlikely that it
will debate Yilmaz's case before the summer recess. The decision to
bring Yilmaz to the Supreme Court will be discussed in the full
parliament after its opening scheduled in October.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz, who believes the delay will cause harm to his party, is
trying to force its coalition partners to vote on the commission's
decision before parliament's recess.
</P>
<P>
If he succeeds, the MHP will be at a crossroad: they will either
send Yilmaz to the Supreme Court and face the possibility of
toppling the coalition government, or clear Yilmaz of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz was getting the early harvest of this pressure on his
partners. Ecevit, who has attached importance to the cabinet's
stability, has voiced his concern about MHP's move.
</P>
<P>
It was expected that the parliament might have an early debate
of Yilmaz's case, if Ecevit maintains his position toward a cabinet
in unity.

<HEADLINE> Germany to Receive 400 Former Pro-Israeli Militiamen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Germany will receive 400 former
South Lebanon Army (SLA) militiamen and their family members and
allow them to settle in Germany, German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after his meeting with Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy, Fischer said the decision of his government is
purely out of humanitarian considerations.
</P>
<P>
Israel completed its troop withdrawal from south Lebanon on May
24 and it said that over 6,000 former pro-Israel SLA members and
their family members entered Israel along with Israel's pullout in
fear of reprisal from Lebanese guerrillas who had been fighting to
end Israeli occupation in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, who arrived here on Saturday for a three-day working
visit, was updated by Levy on the latest development of the Middle
East peace process and Israel's troop withdrawal from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
During the Monday meeting, the two also discussed various ideas
on advancing bilateral Israeli-German relations and relations
between Israel and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Fischer is also scheduled to hold talks later in the evening
with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.

<HEADLINE> Debate on Lifting Former Israeli Minister's Immunity Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Knesset (parliament)
House Committee on Monday decided to put off for a month its debate
on stripping former Transport Minister Yitzhak Mordechai of the
parliamentary immunity to allow sexual harrassment charges to be
brought against him.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai requested the delay in order to decide whether he
wants to appeal before the attorney general in a hearing.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, also the former chair of the Center Party which holds
six seats in the Knesset, submitted his resignation at the end of
May following Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein's ruling that he
had sexually assaulted three women over the past eight years.
</P>
<P>
The attorney general has also called for stripping Mordechai's
immunity as Knesset member to pave the way for him to be put on
trial. If convicted, Mordechai could face up to seven years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the 55-year-old retired general has already received a
one-week delay to consider whether to attend the hearing.
</P>
<P>
Following Mordechai's resignation, Tourism Minister Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak has been appointed the new Center Party chair. He is
also to be named the Transport Minister in replacement of
Mordechai, who took a leave of office in early March following the
start of police investigation into allegations against him.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak has intended to place the Center
Party's new No. 2 man, Knesset (parliament) member Dan Meridor,
into the post of Tourism Minister. His negotiations with Meridor
have yielded no results so far.
</P>
<P>
Meridor, chairman of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense
Committee, has reservations about the assignment as he sets his
sights on other posts such as the Justice Ministry portfolio now
held by Yossi Beilin of Barak's One Israel party. Meridor is also
said to be interested in receiving the defense portfolio, now held
by Barak.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports that Barak may use the opportunity of
Mordechai's resignation to reshuffle the cabinet in view of Housing
Minister Yitzhak Levy's intention to quit the government over the
handover of the Arab village Abu Dis just outside Jerusalem to full
Palestinian control. Levy is from the conservative National
Religious Party which has five representations in the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Another vacancy in the cabinet is also likely to be created as
Regional Cooperation Minister Shimon Peres has become the leading
candidate for presidency.
</P>
<P>
Barak's aids have indicated that the prime minister is eager for
Meridor to take the Tourism offer, and that he plans to assign
Meridor, a close friend of his, to the ministerial team responsible
for advanced stages of negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In case Meridor turns down the Tourism portfolio proposal, the
same offer will be put to the Center Party's next highest-ranking
figure, Knesset member Ronim Milo.

<HEADLINE> Over One Ton of Drugs Seized in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran's security forces seized some 1,
191 kilograms of various narcotic drugs in the past few days in the
northeastern province of Khorasan bordering Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
According to the province's security forces, the illicit drugs
were hauled during four armed encounters with smugglers, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 19 smugglers were killed and 142 smugglers arrested
during the operations.
</P>
<P>
Iran is a main transit route for drugs smuggled from neighboring
Pakistan and Afghanistan, the world's largest opium producer, to
Europe and oil-rich Gulf Arab states.
</P>
<P>
It started strict anti-drug campaigns in 1989 after the Iranian
Majlis (parliament) passed an anti-drug law authorizing capital
punishment for drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian official said last month that over 262 tons of
various narcotics were seized in the country in the past Iranian
year that ended on March 19.
</P>
<P>
A total of 185 Iranian anti-drug forces were killed in the year
in clashes with drug traffickers, bringing the total number since
the 1979 Islamic revolution to 3,000.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Makes Efforts to Protect Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Environment Minister Ben
Mwila said here Monday that the efforts in his country to protect
environment had achieved some good results.
</P>
<P>
Marking the World Environment Day which falls on June 5, he
said that Zambia's most pressing environmental problems include
air and water pollution, waste disposal, inadequate sanitation,
land and wetland degradation and wildlife depletion.
</P>
<P>
He said his country had worked out standards and regulations to
control air pollution. The Environmental Council of Zambia is
empowered to regulate emissions and put procedures for monitoring
pollution from industry.
</P>
<P>
He said the government had developed regulations for the
importation, handling, production and storage of pesticides and
will ensure that only registered chemicals are brought in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Although Zambia has a forest cover of about 60 percent of its
land, this resource is quickly being depleted owing to increased
population as well as needs for firewood, timber and farmland, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Conservatively, the annual rate of deforestation has been
estimated at about 250,000 to 300,000 hectares. My ministry is
determined to fight this scourge through the provision of forest
policies that are conducive to sustainable forest management,"
said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Zambia is endowed with a number of wetlands rich in
biodiversity, which are threatened with degradation as a result of
draining them for settlement and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is preparing a wetland policy to guide
the utilization of the wetland.
</P>
<P>
He said poaching posed the most serious threat to wildlife
conservation, and habitat destruction from mining, logging,
agriculture and human settlements are further exacerbating the
situation leading to disappearance of black rhino and near
disappearance of elephants in the country.

<HEADLINE> Ageing to Exert Impact on Pensions: World Bank Economist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A rapidly ageing population
structure will place pressure on the sustainability of retirement
funding, top World Bank economist Estelle James said in South
Africa on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Institute of Retirement Funds' annual
conference in Cape Town, she said South Africa had a rapidly
ageing urban population.
</P>
<P>
By 2030 the proportion of the world's population that was over
the age of 60 would practically double, and this trend was
particularly strong in developing countries, she was quoted as
saying by the South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
She said South Africa should follow the international move
toward a multi-pillared retirement structure.
</P>
<P>
In South Africa, company retirement funding was often voluntary
and largely only taken up by the top third of the population.
</P>
<P>
The system would be under pressure if the urban lower middle
class increase.
</P>
<P>
James recommended that this private sector retirement funding
be made mandatory and preferably structured on a defined
contribution basis.
</P>
<P>
This would enhance sustainability and economic growth and guard
against benefit promises that were too high and tax increases as
the population aged, she said.

<HEADLINE> Rival Leaders of Nigerian Senate Reach Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The two opposing camps in Nigerian
Senate have agreed to reconvene the upper house of parliament on
Tuesday, local press reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement between Senate President Chuba Okadigbo and his
deputy Alhaji Abubakar was brokered by President Olusegun
Obasanjo's ruling People' s Democratic Party in a meeting held in
the capital Abuja on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The senate is to discuss the supplementary bill for year 2000
budget and a bill on the development of the country' s oil
producing Niger delta region.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar is spearheading moves to topple the senate president,
accusing Okadigbo of lacking personal integrity.
</P>
<P>
The country's capital saw a surprising drama last week when the
maces in the senate chamber, indispensable for a session, were
missing and police forced into Okadigbo's residence to search for
them.
</P>
<P>
Okadigbo announced last week to adjourned the upper house until
July 7. Some senators led by the vice senate president criticized
the decision as trying to delay the debating of some issues of
vital importance.
</P>
<P>
President Obasanjo has repeatedly criticized the senate for the
constant delays in passing important bills, such as the
anti-corruption bill and the 2000 federal budget.
</P>
<P>
The senators on the other hand accused President Obasanjo of
acting unilaterally on issues that require the approval of the
senate.

<HEADLINE> Jails Sentences for Four Israelis over Jewish Olympics Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEL AVIV, June 5 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli court on Monday
sentenced four Israelis up to 21 months in jail, who were
convicted of manslaughter for the death of four Australians in a
bridge collapse during the opening ceremony of the 1997 Maccabiah
Games in Israel.
</P>
<P>
A group of 60 athletes also injured when the footbridge
collapsed into a polluted river during the ceremony of the Jewish
Olymics in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
Miha Bar Ilan, the engineer who designed the footbridge, was
sentenced 21 months in jail, plus 21 months suspended.
</P>
<P>
Two businessmen with the bridge construction company were each
given sentences of 15 months and two years suspended while the
director of public works, Adam Mishori, who assigned the project,
was sentenced to nine months in jail and 15 months suspended.
</P>
<P>
The former head of the games' organizing committee, Yoram Eyal,
who was convicted of manslaughter along with the other four
defendants in April, was ordered to do six months community
service and serve an 18-month suspended jail sentence.
</P>
<P>
The five had faced possible prison sentences of up to three
years for causing death or injury through neglicence. Although
they all had expressed regret for the tragedy, they denied any
responsiblity.
</P>
<P>
The bridge, built for 21,000 dollars, was described by the
prosecution as having flouted the most basic safety rules. It had
been designed to carry just 100 people when several hundred were
expected.
</P>
<P>
But the five argued they had followed statutory requirements
when they built the footbridge.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish community in Australia has threatened to boycott the
next Maccabiah games and to stage protests at the 2000 Olympics in
Sydney.

The campaign is just one of a number of efforts tourism bodies
in Hong Kong are making to protect the environment, said JCTI
Chairman Philip Chen.
</P>
<P>
"We feel it is important to mark the World Environment Day with
an initiative of this kind. We want to show that our industry has
a clear understanding of the importance of environmental awareness,
" he noted.

<P>
JCTI member organizations will continue to promote energy
conservation, waste minimization and management, environmental
supervision, staff education and sponsorship of local green groups,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Selina Chow, chairman of the Hong Kong Tourist Association,
emphasized the significance of this type of effort and highlighted
how "green" tourism activities are becoming increasingly popular.
</P>
<P>
The World Environment Day was established by the General
Assembly of the United Nations in 1972. Each year, the U.N.
Environment Program chooses a theme and the theme for the year

<HEADLINE> HK Issues Consultation Paper on Domain Names Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region government Monday published a consultation
paper on the proposed arrangements for the administration and
assignment of Internet domain names and Internet protocol (IP)
addresses in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The paper was produced by a task force set up under the
Information Infrastructure Advisory Committee (IIAC) in October
1999 to review the administration and assignment of Internet
domain names and IP addresses.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the task force, Charles Kao, told a press
conference, "In reviewing the subject, we have carefully studied
the existing arrangements in Hong Kong and also the practices in
other economies."
</P>
<P>
The major recommendations of the task force include setting up
a new policy-making and administrative body, comprising members
from different sectors, to assume the overall responsibility for
Internet domain names administration in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The task force believed that more flexibility should be
provided in the registration of .hk domain names and companies and
organizations should be allowed to register more than one domain
name. Domain names ending with .hk should in principle be
transferable on valid grounds and registration by individuals in
Hong Kong should be allowed, it said.
</P>
<P>
The task force also suggested that an alternative dispute
resolution mechanism should be established to strengthen the
administrative measures on domain names dispute resolution.
</P>
<P>
As of April 2000, the number of domain names in Hong Kong
ending with .hk is around 37,000 whereas that of monthly new
applications exceeds 2,000.

<P>
CAIRO, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs from
Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt and Japan signed on Sunday a number of agreements
by which the latter will offer Egypt three grants estimated at 45
million U.S. dollars to finance projects in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The first agreement concerns an additional grant to Ferdan
Bridge on the Suez Canal which is set to be concluded in October
2001. The additional grant is aiming to accelerate the construction
of the bridge which links Africa and Asia and help fulfill
comprehensive development in the Sinai peninsula.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- The Yemeni Saba Trade and Contracting Company announced
the conclusion of Jabal Sabr road in Taaz city. The road was
financed by a grant from Saudi Minister of Defense and Aviation,
Prince Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz.
</P>
<P>
The 16-kilometer road starts from Taaz up to the peak of Sabr
Mountain at a height of 3,060 meters, said the company's board
chairman Abdel Haq Saed.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Oman has decided to raise the May retroactive price
of its crude oil by 3.71 dollars to 26.66 dollars per barrel, an
oil and gas ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
Rashed bin Khalid Al-Birwani, advisor for marketing affairs at
the ministry, said the decision was taken due to the rise in world
oil prices.
</P>
<P>
He noted the price for April was 22.95 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Oman pumps about 900,000 barrels of crude oil a day.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Oman has made a remark that it would export 260,000
cubic metres of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to the United States,
with the first delivery scheduled in July.
</P>
<P>
"It is a short-term agreement with Coral Energy to deliver two
cargoes of liquefied natural gas in July and August," Nasser Al
Balushi, LNG spokesman in the ministry of oil and gas said.
</P>
<P>
Oman shipped its first cargo of liquefied natural gas in April
to South Korea from the Oman LNG terminal in the eastern coastal
city of Sur.
</P>
<P>
Oman LNG earlier said it would start LNG exports to Spain in the
fourth quarter of 2000.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia, Thailand Open Border Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia and Thailand opened
talks here Monday in an effort to resolve their long-lasting
border conflict.
</P>
<P>
At the talks, both sides expressed their optimism that the
border conflict will be resolved.
</P>
<P>
Sukhumbhand Paribatra, Thai deputy foreign minister, led the
Thai delegation while his Cambodian counterpart, Var Kimhong,
headed the Cambodian side.
</P>
<P>
This is the second meeting of the Cambodian-Thai Joint
Commission on Demarcation of Land Boundary. The first one was held
in Thailand last year.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia claims that Thailand has encroached some parts of its
803-kilometer borderlines in its northern and western parts.
</P>
<P>
At least four provinces of Koh Kong, Pursat, Battambang and
Banteay Meanchey have been invaded by Thailand, Cambodia charged
in a report issued Monday before the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Var Kimhong, chief of the Cambodian side, said the meeting will
last until Wednesday and a memorandum of understanding will be
signed by the time.
</P>
<P>
The meeting takes place just days ahead of Thai Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai's visit to Cambodia from June 14 to 16.
</P>
<P>
The border demarcation between the two countries was determined
in the late 1910s during the French colonial regime in which 73
border posts were erected, but it is unclear how many of them
remain today, Var Kimhong told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"The delay in the examination on the border conflict was caused
by three decades of civil war, insecurity along the border and
land mines," he said.
</P>
<P>
Var Kimhong, however, said the border checking will be started
by the end of the year if the two sides agree at this meeting.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Undergoes Investigation Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Former Indonesian President
Soeharto underwent investigation again at his residence here
Monday for corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
"Today's investigation still focused on the foundations he
chaired, particularly in connection with the distribution of the
foundations' fund," Spokesman of the Attorney General Office (AGO)
Yushar Yahya told reporters after the questioning.
</P>
<P>
He said prosecutors from the AGO filed 25 questions during the
two and half hours of questioning.
</P>
<P>
But no reports were available on the health condition of the 78-
years old man at the time of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
A member of Soeharto's lawyer team Mohammad Assegaf said
Soeharto's health condition "is not conducive enough for
investigation."
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, the AGO prosecutors ceased the investigation when
Soeharto's blood pressure rose up to 170/80 mm hg after he
answered 24 long and complicated questions.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto has been under house arrest since last Monday.
</P>
<P>
He is suspected of abusing power and authority during his 32
years of rule.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Marzuki Darusman has said dossiers of Soeharto
's case will be submitted to the court in August.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Developing countries in the Asian-
Pacific region should strengthen their ability to meet numerous
challenges ahead, senior officials from countries in the region
and the United Nations said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ministerial meeting of the 56th session of the
U.N.Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP)
, the officials stressed that for these countries, there is no
other choice but to better prepare themselves for all the incoming
challenges of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai said in his inaugural address
to the meeting, held here from June 5 to 7, that although Asia is
expected to continue to be the world's fastest growing region,this
does not mean the end of concerns and challenges.
</P>
<P>
"Here, it is imperative that we strengthen our respective
national capacities," he stressed. "In short, we have to improve
our ability to compete."
</P>
<P>
Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan and senior officials from
other countries in the Asian-Pacific region also urged the
developing countries in the region to strengthen their capacity
and find ways and means to face the big challenges.
</P>
<P>
In a written message to the meeting, U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan pointed out that the Asian-Pacific region is now facing
"a range of complex and pressing issues" and "the overarching
challenge is to manage the risks and seize the opportunities of
globalization."
</P>
<P>
Adrianus Mooy, U.N. under-secretary-general and ESCAP executive
secretary, promised at the meeting that the ESCAP remains
committed to assisting the region's developing countries in
building their capacity.
</P>
<P>
"One of the principal purposes of this forum is to see how best
we can address these challenges collectively with a view to
accelerating the pace of growth and dealing with complex social
issues," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chirac to Speak on Reforming Presidential Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac will
make a televised speech Monday evening on reforming the
presidential term from seven years to five years.
</P>
<P>
So far Chirac has not publicly given his definite view on
shortening the presidential term, but he is widely expected to
approve such a reform.
</P>
<P>
The proposal to shorten the presidential term was first made on
May 10 by former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, who said that
the seven-year term is outdated.
</P>
<P>
The seven-year presidential term was introduced into the
Constitution of the Fifth Republic in 1958 by President Charles de
Gaulle who intended to strengthen the power of the chief of state.
</P>
<P>
A draft law on reforming the presidential term, which should be
presented by Chirac and the government jointly, would be put to
vote either through a referendum or through a congressional voting
by the two chambers of the parliament.

<HEADLINE> BIS: China Grows Faster Than Other Asian Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BASEL, SWITZERLAND, June 5 (Xinhua) -- China has grown faster
than other Asian countries although output growth has been on a
slowing trend for several years, the Bank for International
Settlements (BIS) said in its 70th annual report published here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report, covering the period between April 1999 and March
2000, said that the authorities in China sought to ease monetary
conditions by lowering nominal interest rates and cutting reserve
requirements while confronted with falling prices and rising
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
"They also directed banks to increase credit for infrastructure,
housing and exports, provide more working capital to state-owned
enterprises and grant more consumer credit," the BIS said.
</P>
<P>
In China, exports were stimulated in the latter half of 1999 by
an increase in tax rebates, according to the BIS. Partly as a
result of a crackdown on smuggling, there was a particularly large
rise in reported imports in China.
</P>
<P>
Various patterns of restructuring are also beginning to emerge
in China, where the state-owned enterprise (SOE) reform agenda has
focused on improving management and governance, according to the
BIS report. Large SOEs are being corporatized and many are forming
joint ventures with foreign investors, while small SOEs are
quickly moving out of the state sector, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs from
the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israeli import of durable goods continued to
accelerate in May with automobile imports up 17 percent from the
previous month and up 82 percent compared to May 1999.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Central Bureau of Statistics on Monday
indicated that 59,335 passenger vehicles were brought into Israel
during the first five months of 2000, representing a total value of
535.8 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The total amount of durable goods imported during the months of
January through May hit 629.9 million dollars, versus 466.8 million
dollars during the same period in 1999 -- an increase of 35
percent.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The Israel Bar Association is expected to allow its
members to advertise their offices, fees and specializations in the
national, local and professional press.
</P>
<P>
The National Council of the association is expected to meet soon
to discuss the recommendations of an internal association committee
on revising the rules of ethics that guide lawyers in advertizing.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- El Al Israel Airlines lost 36 million dollars
during the first quarter of 2000 and expects to finish the year
with a loss of 50 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The substantial first-quarter loss is attributable to high fuel
prices. The summer season is expected to be "balanced," but
projections for the latter part of the year are not positive.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- Trade between the United Arab Emirates and Japan in
1999 rose by 1.96 percent to 11.3 billion dollars compared with 11.
1 billion dollars in 1998, powered by the surge in crude oil
prices, according to a report issued by Japanese External Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
The rise in UAE's exports helped shore up trade, in spite of a
decline in Japan's exports to the UAE. Exports from the UAE cover
nearly 78 percent of Japan-UAE trade.
</P>
<P>
The report also indicated the UAE is Japan's ninth largest
supplier of products and services.

<HEADLINE> Environment Protection Makes Headway in Ankara By Huai Chengbo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- This year's World Environment Day on
June 5 is being marked in Turkey with tangible progress in
environmental protection in the country's capital of Ankara.
</P>
<P>
With a population of nearly four million and the increasing
expansion of the municipalities, pressure has been building up on
the authorities to grapple with a variety of problems accompanying
industrialization and modernization.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a German government loan, the construction of Ankara
central wastewater treatment plant, located 40 kilometers from the
city center, was undertaken by former Ankara Greater Municipality
Mayor Murat Karayalcin and put into operation by current Ankara
Mayor Melih Gokcek.
</P>
<P>
The huge 200-million-U.S. dollar complex, the fourth biggest in
the world, has made the first step in a city designed to ease
pollution and protect the environment in line with the European
Union standard.
</P>
<P>
The wastewater treatment plant cleans 90 percent of 750,000
cubic meters of domestic and industrial wastewater the city
produces in a 10-hour period daily and provides 24-hour service
each day yearly.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another thorny environmental issue is being solved.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Mamak municipality and the Greater Ankara
municipality have agreed to move the Mamak garbage dump, which has
been in use for 20 years and is spread close to the city center, to
Sincan on the western outskirts of the capital. New modern facility
will reportedly open in August this year.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Gokcek has promised that the Mamak dump will be
transformed and trees planted to create a big park in its place.

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns Fingerprinting of Iranians at U.S. Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi has denounced a U.S. immigration department
decision to fingerprint Iranian nationals participating in the "
Women 2000" international conference in New York, the Islamic
Republic New Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Seven representatives from Iran's non-governmental organizations
refused to enter the United States for the conference when they had
been required to undergo a fingerprinting procedure at the New York
airport, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Asefi, quoted by the agency, said the U.S. immigration measure
is a clear contradiction of its declared goodwill intentions toward
Iran, particularly recent overtures of certain U.S. officials aimed
at improving cultural and political ties with the Iranian nation.
</P>
<P>
Since the visas of the Iranian nationals were issued through the
United Nations, the measure taken by the U.S. immigration officials
is an insult to the U.N., particularly to the U.N.-sponsored "Women
2000" meeting, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Iran will file a protest with the U.N. to
express its dissatisfaction to the measure and will follow up the
issue.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,250 representatives of non-governmental organizations
from countries around the world are taking part in the five-day
meeting to be opened in the U.N. headquarters on June 5.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian official delegation, headed by Zahra Shojaie,
presidential advisor and head of the Center for Women's Activities,
is attending the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Iran and the U.S. severed diplomatic relations in 1980 following
the 1979 Islamic revolution and the hostage-taking incident at the
U.S. Embassy in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Since moderate President Mohammad Khatami took office in 1997,
officials of the two countries have softened their hostile tones
toward each other and expressed their volition to improve
unofficial contacts and exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the U.S. also declared the lifting of bans on
Iranian exports of carpets, caviar, pistachios, which received
positive response from the Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
However, there are forces in both countries who oppose the
resumption of full relations, which indicate that ties between the
two long-time foes can hardly be normalized in a short time.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Equal World Trading Environment for Developing Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese government representative
urged here Monday the creation of an international multilateral
trading system based on fairness and equality, in which developing
countries are ensured an unimpeded and indiscriminate access of
their products to the international market.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at the 56th session of the U.N. Economic
and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), Zhang
Yesui, head of the Chinese delegation and assistant foreign
minister, said a sound multilateral trading system is of special
importance to developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"We should work together to establish and maintain a reliable
and predictable international multilateral trading system and
environment based on fairness and equality, a system which will
help the development of all countries, developing ones in
particular," said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
He urged the World Trade Organization (WTO) to implement to the
full the agreements of the Uruguay Round, noting that many
elements of the agreements that are of great concern to developing
countries have not been implemented fully or in a timely fashion.
</P>
<P>
"Developed countries should effectively fulfill their
obligations and give developing countries greater market access to
enable the latter to benefit from the process of trade and
investment liberalization," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang also urged the proposed new round of WTO negotiations to
give full consideration to the interests of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He said it is important to ensure effective participation of
developing countries and adequate solicitation of their views and
to accommodate the needs and concerns of these countries in a
balanced and fair manner in deciding the agenda.
</P>
<P>
"Trade protectionism in whatever forms should be firmly opposed,
" Zhang said. "Environmental protection, labor standards and other
such issues should not be included in the new round of
negotiations."
</P>
<P>
"Still less should one try to politicize trade issues, erect
new trade barriers in the name of environmental protection or
labor standards and resort to protectionism against developing
countries to offset their comparative advantage in international
trade and hamper their economic growth," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Saying China is in the final procedural stage in its efforts to
join the WTO, Zhang promised that the country will earnestly
observe the WTO rules and fulfill its commitments.
</P>
<P>
He also declared that apart form the U.S. dollar contribution,
China will increase its local currency contribution to ESCAP from
750,000 renminbi yuan last year (90,300 dollars) to 1 million yuan
(120,480 dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
The theme topic of the 56th session, which is being held here
from June 1 to 7, is "development through globalization and
partnership in the 21st century: an Asia-Pacific perspective for
integrating developing countries and economies in transition into
the international trading system on a fair and equitable basis."
</P>
<P>
ESCAP, based in Bangkok, is the largest of the five U.N.
regional commissions, comprising 52 members and nine associate
members and representing some 60 percent of the world's population,
or 3.5 billion people.

<HEADLINE> IMF Optimistic Over Indonesia's Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Managing Director of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) Horst Koehler said here Monday
that Indonesia's economy will grow by 4 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the Indonesian government to accelerate the
implementation of the country's economic recovery program
contained in a letter of intent between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"The economic recovery program that was adopted by the
government is working and you can see it in certain
accomplishments, particularly you can see that the economic growth
is coming back. And the experts of the IMF expect that for
Indonesia the economy will grow by 4 percent,"Koehler told a press
conference here before leaving for India as a part of his Asia
tour.
</P>
<P>
"That is of course not enough to solve every of all huge
problems (in Indonesia), but it is a good and an encouraging
starting point," Koehler added.
</P>
<P>
Koehler arrived here on Sunday for a two-day visit, during
which he met with President Abdurrahman Wahid, Vice President
Megawati Soekarnoputeri, Speaker of the Indonesian Parliament
Akbar Tandjung, Minister of Finance Bambang Sudibyo and other
government officials.
</P>
<P>
He said, "I came here to also personally reconfirm, reassure
that we are here to support, to help, we are not here to lecture (
the Indonesian government) but we give advice, frank advice,
because we feel that is our duty," Koehler added.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the Indonesian people to work hand in hand to
make the economic recovery program successful.
</P>
<P>
Koehler also said President Wahid will closely monitor the
implementation of the economic recovery program.
</P>
<P>
"That is good news particularly for investors, because they
know that the direction (of economic recovery) is clear and is
fully backed by the president and his economic team," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Koehler cautioned the Indonesian Banking Restructuring
Agency (IBRA), an agency under the control of the Ministry of
Finance, to accelerate the privatization process to stimulate
economic dynamics.
</P>
<P>
"The president and I agree to accelerate the decision-making
process in the IBRA. That means to sell assets to restructure(
ailing enterprises) in order to stimulate investment and economic
dynamics. Further delay in the process of asset sales and the
restructuring of enterprises would lead to the deterioration of
asset values of IBRA," Koehler said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Worried about Disposal of Expired Pesticides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is worried about
seeking financial aid to dispose of about 960 tons of expired
pesticides scattered all over the country, local newspapers
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania needs donation of some 3.84 million U.S. dollars to
dispose of the expired pesticides in more than 300 sites, an
official was quoted as saying at a one-day seminar on control of
pesticides importation in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The Registrar of Pesticides Jonathan Akhabuhaya told the
seminar held in Tanga in the eastern coast that a two-year survey
conducted by a waste management committee formed by the government
showed that most of the expired pesticides were found in the
cotton-growing regions.
</P>
<P>
The registrar also noted that the expired pesticides were
either imported by crop authorities or were in the form of
assistance given by donors to farmers.
</P>
<P>
"Others were imported by unscrupulous businessmen who failed to
sell all their pesticides while some belonged to centers
experimenting on new pesticides," he added.
</P>
<P>
Akhabuhaya said that as a proposal seeking funds to destroy the
 pesticides had already been prepared and sent to potential
donors, the Netherlands had expressed interest in funding the
project.
</P>
<P>
He challenged the customs officers to co-operate closely in
fighting against illegal importation of pesticides so that
Tanzania was not turned into a dumping ground for expired or
sub-standard chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the seminar said that the free market was being
taken as an excuse to import unregistered and sub-standard
pesticides that could cause untold loss to the country by
adversely affecting crops and livestock and becoming health
hazards to humans.

Southern Africa (COMESA) Free Trade Area (FTA) in October this
year, a senior official at COMESA center said.
</P>
<P>
Charles Chanthunya, Director of Trade, Customs and Monetary
Affairs at the center, made the remarks in an interview with
Zambia Daily Mail newspaper published on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Currently, COMESA regional market attracts 25 percent of
Zambia's exports and this is with duty, so we expect the market to
increase when duty is lifted. As for losing revenue, our research
shows that Zambia would lose one percent or less," Chanthunya
said.
</P>
<P>
Chanthunya said there was a possible increase in value added
tax once the country entered FTA as the government had no way of
raising revenue from duty.

<HEADLINE> BIS: World Economic Growth Faster Than Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BASEL, SWITZERLAND, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Growth rates in most
parts of the world in the period between April 1999 and March 2000
were significantly faster than expected, the Bank for
International Settlements (BIS) said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the annual report published on the occasion of its 70th
annual general meeting, the Basel-based BIS said that the world
real GDP outcome during the period under review was 2.6 percent,
tremendously higher than its forecast of 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Inflation stayed very low in most industrial and emerging
market countries, while economic growth remained high in the
United States, picked up in Europe and began to recover later in
the year in Latin America, according to the BIS report.
</P>
<P>
The BIS said that the turnaround in the fortunes of several
crisis-hit East Asian countries was nothing short of remarkable,
and China and India continued to expand at high rates. Even in
Japan, there were signs that the worst might be over.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there were increasing grounds for believing that this
might be a longer-term trend based on some combination of
continuing deregulation, new technology and capital deepening in
many countries.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the BIS pointed out that significant
macroeconomic imbalances could be identified. In countries like
the United States where the expansion was furthest advanced,
underlying inflationary pressures were of increasing concern, as
were rising debt levels.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, financial markets returned to risk-taking with
increasing eagerness, according to the BIS. Prices of many stocks,
especially in the technology sector, reached new highs and
borrowing spreads on private debt securities eased gradually
despite episodes of liquidity pressure, as long-term interest
rates rose.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of 2000, it said, both equity and credit
markets wavered, especially in the United States, reflecting
concerns about excessive valuations, uncertainty about the extent
and impact of monetary tightening and supply development in U.S.
government debt.
</P>
<P>
Historically high current account imbalances and global stock
market valuations went hand in hand with large and often volatile
movements in the value of major currencies, said the BIS.
</P>
<P>
In its conclusion, the BIS cautioned, "There remains
considerable uncertainty as to whether the global economy is at
the beginning of a long boom, driven by technology and
deregulation, or whether it is significantly exposed to the
possibility of a downturn through which long-standing
macroeconomic imbalances will eventually be resolved."
</P>
<P>
It said that there was also an unusual degree of uncertainty
about how financial markets which have been evolving rapidly,
might react to possibly adverse macroeconomic shocks.

<HEADLINE> France Opposed to More German Votes in EU Councils </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- France is opposed to introducing more
German votes than French votes in European Union (EU) councils of
ministers in the process of reforming the EU institutions, French
Delegate Minister for European Affairs Pierre Moscovici said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the radio and television channel Europe 1,
Moscovici said that France and Germany are close to a bilateral
agreement on EU institutional reform, "but we have not agreed that
France have fewer votes in the European councils than Germany,
because France is also a great country."
</P>
<P>
Quoting German sources, the French daily Le Monde reported last
Thursday that France and Germany have reached an agreement of
principle on reforming EU institutions, including a French
recognition of more German votes than French votes in future EU
councils of ministers.
</P>
<P>
Germany asks for more votes in the councils because its
population is much greater than that of France.
</P>
<P>
Presently, France, Germany, Britain and Italy are the "four
bigs" in the EU councils with the same number of votes.
</P>
<P>
France hopes to complete the reform of EU institutions during
its term of the rotating EU presidency in the second half of this
year, in order to prepare for the enlargement of the EU from the
present 15 to 25 or 30 member countries in the future.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pacifies Russian Parliament on Democracy, Missile Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Monday placated Russian politicians with praises of the nation's
advance to "democracy and the free market," dismissing the
differences between the two countries on missile defense as a "
technical" problem to be eventually resolved.
</P>
<P>
The development of Russia will determine the international
situation in the 21st century to a large extent, and the
characteristics of the new century will very much depend on the
success of the people of Russia in building a modern democracy and
freedom, Clinton said in his first speech at Russia's State Duma,
the lower house of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the future of Russia is in its own hands and
cannot depend on others.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian people do not have to be told how to assess how
freedom outweighs the deprivations caused by economic difficulties,
corruption and criminality," Clinton said, noting that Russians
had not attained the country promised in 1991 when the Soviet
Union collapsed.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Russian nationals have a real chance to "build a
modern, strong, democratic state that is part of the life of the
rest of the world" and the modern world sees a different Russia,
not the Russia of 1991, said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
In the first speech by a major Western leader to the State Duma,
Clinton said Russia's economy was growing and the vast country was
beginning to produce the goods and services people wanted.
</P>
<P>
He said differences between the two countries on missile
defense were "mainly technical and could eventually be resolved."
</P>
<P>
He and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed at a summit on
Sunday that there was an emerging threat from the so-called rogue
states, but did not agree on how to tackle it.
</P>
<P>
"I learned on my trip to Russia the issue is not whether we
intend to do something that will undermine mutual deterrence, ...
the real question is a debate over what the impact of this will be,
because of the capacity of the technology involved," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that we ought to be able to reach an agreement about
how we should proceed at each step along the way here in a way
that preserves mutual deterrence, preserves strategic stability
and preserves the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. That is my goal,"
he told Russian deputies.
</P>
<P>
The United States wants to amend the 1972 anti-ballistic
missile (ABM) treaty to deploy a national anti-missile defense
shield to intercept incoming rogue rockets. But Moscow would
rather place defenses close to risky states to shoot down missiles
as they are launched.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president said the United States would support
Russia's bid to join the World Trade Organization. "But you must
know the decision to join the WTO requires difficult choices that
only you can make," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Russia, which applied in 1993 to enter the WTO, recently said
it was ready to intensify efforts to join the trade bloc.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Russian Federation Council, the upper chamber,
were also present in the Duma to hear Clinton's speech, one of his
last engagements before he heads for Ukraine on his way back to
Washington after a week-long European tour.
</P>
<P>
After addressing the Duma on Monday morning, Clinton will meet
with former Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who shocked the world
with his surprise resignation on New Year's eve.

<HEADLINE> Jayasinghe Qualifies for Olympic Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
COLOMBO, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's sprinter Susanthika
Jayasinghe has qualified for the Asian Games and the Olympic Games
squad but with a disappointing time in the 100m race, according to
reports on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Jayasinghe clocked 11.39 seconds, at a two-day weekend
selection meet, 0.22 seconds slower than when she bagged gold at
an IAAF Japan Grand Prix last year, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 World Championship 200m silver medallist opted out of
the longer spring here, saying the competition was not good enough.
</P>
<P>
Jayasinghe recently returned from the United States where she
has been training following serious differences with Sri Lankan
sports authorities whom she accused of trying to ruin her career.
</P>
<P>
In October last year, the International Amateur Athletics
Federation (IAAF) abandoned its case against Jayasinghe who had
been accused of taking a banned substance, nandrolone.
</P>
<P>
The IAAF explained there were difficulties in making a legal
case, and that there were strong doubts that the Sri Lankan had
breached anti-doping rules.
</P>
<P>
Jayasinghe had been banned after testing positive to taking
the banned steriod in April 1998, but the suspension was lifted
four months later.

<P>
MOSCOW, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Former Russia coach Pavel Sadyrin,
who has resigned from his Uzbekistan coach's job, will take over
struggling premier division side CSKA Moscow, accroding to club
officials Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 57-year-old Sadyrin, who guided Russia in the 1994 World
Cup finals, had been with the Uzbek national team for the last six
months. He succeeds Oleg Dolmatov who resigned last week after a
poor start to the season.
</P>
<P>
It is Sadyrin's third coaching stint at the army side. On his
first attempt, he guided them to the top flight in just one season
in 1989, then two years later, led them to a league and cup double.
</P>
<P>
But on his second, two years ago, Sadyrin was sacked by CSKA
management after a bitter dispute with the players.
</P>
<P>
CSKA are in 13th place in the 16-team premier division with
eight points from 10 matches.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Futures Exchange (
HKFE) launched electronic trading of the Hang Seng Index (HSI)
Futures and Options Monday, marking the beginning of a new era in
the HKFE since its founding in 1976.
</P>
<P>
The migration of HSI Futures and Options to the Hong Kong
Futures Automated Trading System (HKATS) ended the 24-year history
of open outcry trading at the HKFE. All other HKFE products have
been trading on HKATS since September 1997.
</P>
<P>
The advantages of the HKATS include a Compaq Alpha Server 1200
back-end that has processing power 10 times greater than the
Exchange's original electronic trading system and higher bandwidth
internal network with a transmission rate up to 200M Bit per
second.
</P>
<P>
The electronic trading will bring about fairer price and
quicker access, but it will take several weeks or months for the
traders to get accustomed to the new system, said Chief Executive
of the HKFE Frederick J. Grede at the launch ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Grede said the HKFE plans to provide more products, and serve
not only the Hong Kong market but also the regional and
international market.

<HEADLINE> Security Heightened Around Israeli Minister in Light of Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli General Security
Service has increased security around Internal Security Minister
Shlomo Ben-Ami, after he was threatened by right-wing extremists
for his involvement in the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami is heading the Stockholm channel of negotiations with
the Palestinians with an aim to reach a framework agreement over
the issues such as the fate of Jerusalem, the future of
settlements, border, water resources and the refugees. The talks
have been moved back to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a group of demonstrators gathered outside Ben Ami's
residence, shouting threats against him. Ben-Ami said he was not
frightened by the threats.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with leaders of the right-wing Yesha Settlers'
Council on Sunday, the minister raised the issue of threats against
Prime Minister Ehud Barak, security around whom has reportedly been
tightened.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio Monday quoted sources in the General Security
Service as saying that there has been no escalation of threats on
the life of Barak and security around the prime minister has not
been stepped up as it is already at its maximum level.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with Ben-Ami, settler leaders vowed to intensify
protest actions to oppose any attempt to leave tens of thousands of
Jewish settlers under Palestinian control in a final-status deal.
</P>
<P>
They, however, denounced all forms of violence or incitement,
saying that anyone suspected of incitement should be arrested.
</P>
<P>
Barak last week revealed that he would try to keep 80 percent of
the settlements in the West Bank under Israeli control in a future
agreement with the Palestinians and called it a "historic
achievement."
</P>
<P>
The Israelis and Palestinians have been engaged in two tracks of
negotiations. One is targeting at the interim issues including the
final redeployment of Israeli troops on the West Bank, the release
of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and the opening of the
northern passage between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The other is aimed at outlining a framework agreement, which had
missed the deadline twice, to guide the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
In view of the slow progress on both tracks, both sides have
been accusing the other of foot-dragging. To help overcome the snag
in the talks, Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson arrived in
Israel on Sunday to hold separate talks with Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is to arrive
here Monday in a bid to narrow the gaps between the Israelis and
Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Vows to Take Measures Against Separatist Activities in Papua </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid Monday vowed to take some measures against all activities
aimed at declaring an independent Papua.
</P>
<P>
He said the military will take stern measures to pacify the
Papuan region.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Papua National Congress which just ended on
Sunday in Jayapura, capital of West Papua (formerly called Irian
Jaya), the president stressed that the government will not
recognize the results of the congress because its organization was
not in line with an agreement reached between the government and
the congress' organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
The president said the congress' organizing committee had
agreed that only Papuans -- and no foreigners -- would attend the
congress.
</P>
<P>
"But in fact, there were foreigners who attended the congress.
And those who wish to remain (with Indonesia) were not allowed to
take part in the congress. They were not even allowed to get out
of their airplanes at the airport," he told a press conference at
the presidential office here.
</P>
<P>
The week-long congress ended on Sunday with a declaration that
West Papua is no longer a part of Indonesia. Some 5,000 people
were invited to attend the congress, including Papuans living in
the province's 14 districts and Papuan figures living abroad.
Foreign observers from the United States, Japan, Papua New Guinea,
the Netherlands and Australia also took part in the congress.
</P>
<P>
On the congress' wish to invite the Dutch government to
interfere, the president said such interference is not expected at
all and is not supposed to happen.
</P>
<P>
Before the opening of the congress, Chairman of the Papua
Presidium Thom Beanal affirmed that the congress did not aim to
demand independence from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Beanal said the congress would serve as a forum to accommodate
the Papuan people's aspirations to have a legitimate platform for
their struggle to ensure a better future.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, IMF Agree Not to Introduce Capital Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreed here Monday not to
introduce a capital control system in Indonesia to arrest the
falling of the country's currency, the rupiah, a senior IMF
official said.
</P>
<P>
Visiting IMF Managing Director Horst Kohler told a press
conference after meeting with Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid, "The president (Abdurrahman Wahid) and I also fully agreed
that the introduction of capital control would be
counterproductive and he is not going to decide (to impose) the
capital control. He feels that(the introduction) would be a wrong
decision," Kohler said.
</P>
<P>
"I agreed with him because such a decision would deter foreign
investors and would even more weaken the rupiah," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kohler's statement put an end to speculations that the country
would adopt a capital control system instead of the current
floating system in its bid to arrest the falling of the rupiah.
</P>
<P>
Kohler said that what is needed to strengthen the rupiah is a
steady and feasible implementation of the economic program.
</P>
<P>
"The introduction of capital control would hinder a sustained
and a broad economic recovery. What is needed to strengthen
confidence in the rupiah, that is quite clear, is a steady and
feasible implementation of the economic program," Kohler said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the House of Representatives also said it agreed with
the IMF not to impose the capital control system.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after receiving Kohler at the
parliament building, House Speaker Akbar Tandjung said, "The
introduction of foreign exchange control will only deteriorate
Indonesia's economy."
</P>
<P>
"To arrest the further falling of the rupiah, the Indonesian
government should accelerate the implementation of its economic
recovery program as contained in the letter of intent," Tandjung
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on Monday morning the rupiah traded at 8,400 (buying)
and 8,550 (selling) per U.S. dollar.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, IMF Agree Not to Introduce Capital Control (Repeat with correction of IMF official's name) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreed here Monday not to
introduce a capital control system in Indonesia to arrest the
falling of the country's currency, the rupiah, a senior IMF
official said.
</P>
<P>
Visiting IMF Managing Director Horst Koehler told a press
conference after meeting with Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid, "The president (Abdurrahman Wahid) and I also fully agreed
that the introduction of capital control would be
counterproductive and he is not going to decide (to impose) the
capital control. He feels that(the introduction) would be a wrong
decision," Koehler said.
</P>
<P>
"I agreed with him because such a decision would deter foreign
investors and would even more weaken the rupiah," he said.
</P>
<P>
Koehler's statement put an end to speculations that the country
would adopt a capital control system instead of the current
floating system in its bid to arrest the falling of the rupiah.
</P>
<P>
Koehler said that what is needed to strengthen the rupiah is a
steady and feasible implementation of the economic program.
</P>
<P>
"The introduction of capital control would hinder a sustained
and a broad economic recovery. What is needed to strengthen
confidence in the rupiah, that is quite clear, is a steady and
feasible implementation of the economic program," Koehler said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the House of Representatives also said it agreed with
the IMF not to impose the capital control system.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after receiving Koehler at the
parliament building, House Speaker Akbar Tandjung said, "The
introduction of foreign exchange control will only deteriorate
Indonesia's economy."
</P>
<P>
"To arrest the further falling of the rupiah, the Indonesian
government should accelerate the implementation of its economic
recovery program as contained in the letter of intent," Tandjung
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on Monday morning the rupiah traded at 8,400 (buying)
and 8,550 (selling) per U.S. dollar.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Appeal Court Rejects Anwar's Appeal on PM's Testimony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Court of Appeal
Monday rejected former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's
appeal against the High Court's ruling not to call Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad as a witness in his sodomy trial.
</P>
<P>
The court's president, Lamin Yunus, announced the court
decision after allowing preliminary objections raised by Attorney-
General Mohtar Abdullah, who led the prosecution team, pertaining
to the appeal.
</P>
<P>
After the court delivered its decision, Anwar's leading counsel
Christopher Fernando told reporters that the defense would appeal
to the Federal Court and the notice of appeal would be filed as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Justice Lamin also ordered Anwar's sodomy trial before High
Court judge Arifin Jaka to proceed. The sodomy trial was postponed
indefinitely by Arifin pending the disposal of the appeal.
</P>
<P>
Justice Arifin ruled earlier that to call Mahathir to testify
in the trial would be an abuse of the court process and it was his
duty to prevent such a thing from happening.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, 52, is jointly tried with his adopted brother Sukma
Darmawan Sasmitaat Madja, 39, on separate charges of sodomizing
his former family driver Azizan Abu Bakar.
</P>
<P>
Both Anwar and Sukma had applied to the court to have Mahathir
as a defense witness in his personal capacity.
</P>
<P>
Anwar is serving a six-year jail sentence upon conviction on
four counts of corrupt practice of interfering in police
investigations into allegations of his sexual misconduct.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, also the former finance minister, was dismissed from the
cabinet on September 2, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Police to Update Drug Traffickers' List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian police is
working on an updated list of suspected drug traffickers in the
country in collaboration with South African and British
intelligence services.
</P>
<P>
The official Daily News on Monday quoted the Tanzanian Director
of Criminal Investigation Adadi Rajabu as saying that the police
is working closely with the South African and British intelligence
services in the fight against drug trafficking which has earned
the country a place on the blacklist of international
anti-narcotics agencies.
</P>
<P>
"We do not ignore information from any source. We work on them
before pouncing on the suspects," the police chief was quoted as
saying after chairing the eighth operational meeting on drugs for
East African heads of criminal investigation and anti-narcotics
units, which ended in Dar es Salaam last weekend.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Rajabu and his Kenyan counterpart Francis
Sang stressed that geographical position of Tanzania and Kenya is
convenient for drug trafficking to the southern part of Africa,
Europe and America.
</P>
<P>
The police officials admitted that good roads, long unpatrolled
coastal area and borders, plus the Dar es Salaam and Kilimanjaro
international airports in Tanzania, are major advantages for the
flourishing of drug trafficking in the region.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, some of the traffickers use Nairobi in
Kenya and Entebbe in Uganda as points of exit to Europe via the
Middle East.

<HEADLINE> IMF to Audit Kenya on Reform Promises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) plans to conduct half-year audit on Kenya's economic reform
promises reached with donors for the release of 220 million U.S.
dollars in program support.
</P>
<P>
A high-ranking IMF official said the money would be released in
seven batches over a three-year period, with the first released
after the IMF board gives its nod, the East African weekly
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under the arrangement, the Kenyan government is supposed to
publish, probably in mid-June, a set of documents setting forth
the pledges it has made to the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Last month, IMF officials held a three-week discussion with the
 Kenyan officials in Nairobi over the lending programs.
</P>
<P>
Following the talks, a recommendation for the release of
program support held up since 1997 is expected to be presented to
the IMF board next month.
</P>
<P>
The IMF suspended a 205-million-dollar loan to Kenya in July
1997 for reasons of poor governance and rampant corruption.

<HEADLINE> France Reaffirms Readiness to Join U.N. Peacekeeping in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- France reaffirmed on Monday its
readiness to join an expanded United Nations peacekeeping
operation in Lebanon, on the condition that Lebanese government
troops are deployed in the southern border area.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said in a radio
interview that France "does not hesitate at all" to send more
troops to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is preparing for an expanded peacekeeping
mission in Lebanon after Israel pulled out its troops from
Lebanon's southern border area last month.
</P>
<P>
"France does not hesitate at all. But when it is a question of
sending French soldiers in a situation which could become
uncontrollable or even dangerous, it is absolutely normal for the
French president and prime minister to raise all the questions,"
Vedrine told Radio-Television Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
"We remain technically ready, but politically the examination
is not finished because not all the conditions have been met," he
said.
</P>
<P>
France has 249 soldiers serving in the United Nations Interim
Force in Lebanon (UNFIL) deployed since 1978 in the Middle East
state.
</P>
<P>
The mandate of UNFIL should be renewed by the U.N. Security
Council at the end of July and its make-up is expected to be
reinforced from the present 4,500 to 7,900.
</P>
<P>
"The present UNFIL is there until the end of July and there is
no reason to express worry or impatience at the present stage,"
said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Lebanese government should "show the signs of
restoring its authority" in southern Lebanon by sending government
troops there.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Israeli newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Russia has undermined the anti-ballistic missile treaty by
passing on its technology to Middle East "rogue states," perhaps
putting Israel at a greater threat than ever before, a study
released by the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs accused.
</P>
<P>
The study also suggested that it is in Israel's best interests
for the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty to be done away with or
altered, since its present framework is preventing Israel from
enhancing its missile defense.
</P>
<P>
The findings of the study came out as Russian President Vladimir
Putin hosted U.S. President Bill Clinton, who is seeking to alter
the ABM treaty because it restricts the range of anti-missile
defense.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak convened a meeting late
Sunday night to discuss the continuing coalition crisis with the
religious Shas party. Ministers Avraham Shochat, Yossi Beilin and
Shlomo Ben-Ami took part in the discussion.
</P>
<P>
Barak's meeting was held as negotiations continued between
Minister in Barak's Office Haim Ramon and Shas leaders about
revisions in the recovery plan for the party's education system.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations were resumed Sunday night after Shas spurned a
compromise proposal offered by Ramon last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Twelve-year-old Aid Sharon returned safely to Israel on
Sunday, 10 months after being kidnapped on a visit to his father in
Moscow and held for millions of U.S. dollars in ransom.
</P>
<P>
Arriving at Ben-Gurion Airport along with his father Yossi and
Russian Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo at 7 p.m., Sharon was
immediately brought to hospital for treatment for malnutrition and
dehydration.
</P>
<P>
In a dramatic televised raid, a Russian team rescued Sharon
Thursday night from a filthy basement in the southern Russian city
of Penza. The boy had been kept under harsh conditions, not seeing
daylight and subsisting on bread and water. Parts of two of the
boy's fingers had been cut off because his family did not pay the
ransom demanded.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak emphasized at Sunday's
cabinet meeting that the fact that Clinton is still United States
President constitutes a opportunity for Israel to reach an
agreement with the Palestinians now.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Insurer Allowed to Invest More in Securities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The China Pacific Insurance Company
has been recently approved by the China Insurance Regulatory
Commission (CIRC) to invest 15 percent of its assets in securities
investment funds, as against the previous five percent.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Securities newspaper, China Pacific
is the first insurance company approved by the regulators to raise
its securities investment to 15 percent of its assets.
</P>
<P>
China's insurance companies was first permitted to invest in
securities investment funds last October, before which, the
insurers could only deposit their money with banks or invest them
in treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
Limited investment tools and the central bank's consecutive
interest rate cuts have brought increasing insolvency risks for
Chinese insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
The CIRC had said that it would raise the ceiling for insurers'
securities investment based on their asset quality and structure,
risk management ability and operating performances.
</P>
<P>
In March this year, four insurance companies, i.e., the Ping An,
New China Life, Taikang Life and Huatai Properties were approved
to raise the ceiling from five percent to 10 percent.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Mindanao Peace Process on Shaky Ground  By Pan Jiaxu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Challenges loom ahead as the
Philippine government and the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation (MILF)
are trying to find a "final solution" to the decades-old Mindanao
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, negotiation panels from both sides reportedly
agreed to meet again on June 28 to discuss and settle the issue of
the autonomy proposal presented by the government to the MILF, a
step said to meet the June 30 deadline imposed by President Joseph
Estrada.
</P>
<P>
Press reports quoted Estrada as saying that the current peace
talks, resumed on May 29 after months of suspension due to
escalating clashes between government troops and the MILF, will be
the "last chance" of the Muslim rebel group.
</P>
<P>
The government panel said the MILF, which has been fighting for
more than two decades for a separate Islamic state in Mindanao,
has "agreed in principle" to accept autonomy in the resumed peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
However, political observers said there stand a series of
unfavorable factors that might hamper the "final talks" to meet
the deadline for the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the war that is raging on in Mindanao has
undermined the mutual trust -- sentiments which deem to be vital
to helping work out positive results in the forthcoming talks.
</P>
<P>
According to recent reports, the government has rejected a
cease-fire call made by the MILF although the two sides have
agreed to meet again.
</P>
<P>
Increasing its presence in Mindanao, the government troops have
totally surrounded the Abudakar Camp, the headquarters of the MILF,
in Maguindanao, west Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
In ongoing military attacks that have lasted more than a month,
government troops have overrun major MILF camps in the neighboring
provinces of North and South Lanaos.
</P>
<P>
Citing the intensified military pressure, the MILF raised
doubts over the government's sincerity in the peace talks, saying
the military option is not the right way to finalize a settlement
of the conflict in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The government, however, complained that the MILF has played
too much tricks in the past by using a cease-fire statement as a
chance to restore its power buildup rather than to start sincere
talks.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of confidence were lost in the conflict," said Eliseo
Mercardo, chairman of an independent fact-finding committee which
is tasked to monitor the peace talks. Lack of confidence is the
major enemy of the peace talks, he added.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, observers said the intensified military campaign
might result in a destruction of the 15,000-strong MILF before any
peace pact is achieved.
</P>
<P>
Citing the feared risk, observers said that if the MILF
guerrillas vanished militarily, the group would simply splinter
away and they would boycott any peace accord between the
government and the MILF.
</P>
<P>
The observers even made further speculation that the
destruction of the MILF might result in the formation of bandit
groups like the Abu Sayyaf, which is holding 21 mostly foreign
hostages in Sulu and eight all-Filipino hostages in Basilan.
</P>
<P>
In that case, the observers said, any forging of a peace
agreement between the government and the MILF only means that more
"shoot and talk" tasks lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
In addition, how to keep a good balance between the mainstream
Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and the MILF is another
challenge to the government advocated autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Reports disclosed Monday that Governor Nur Misuari of the
Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) has been trying to
block the forging of a peace pact between the government and the
MILF.
</P>
<P>
Misuari, also chief of the former rebel group of the MNLF,
reportedly said during his recent trip to Saudi Arabia that the
government has delayed its full implementation of the Manila-MNLF
peace treaty signed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Manila-MNLF treaty provided for an expansion of the ARMM to
cover 10 cities and 14 provinces in Mindanao. At present, the ARMM
consists only of the four provinces of Maguindanao, South Lanao,
Tawi-Tawi and Sulu.
</P>
<P>
Misuari's statement has been widely believed to be a caution on
the MILF, the breakaway faction of the MNLF, to boycott the
proposed autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said that a separate autonomous region for the
MILF would include portions of the yet-to-be-expanded ARMM, adding
that the government proposal would inevitably arouse territorial
disputes between the MNLF and the MILF.
</P>
<P>
"The MILF will not agree to that (to be included in an expanded
ARMM)," MILF spokesman Eid Kabalu was reported as saying. "This is
not a joke ... It can not be done that way."
</P>
<P>
"They (the government) want to dictate the outcome of the
negotiation. On our part, we want a negotiated solution, otherwise
the problems will come again," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
While noting the peace talks might bring hopes for a political
solution to the Mindanao conflict, analysts said that things could
become worse before they get better in the peace process, which is
set on a shaky ground.

CANBERRA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Fiji's military government Monday
handed coup leader George Speight and his men an ultimatum to
release their hostages and lay down their guns, the Australian
Associated Press (AAP) reported.
</P>
<P>
The AAP said that in the army's strongest warning yet to the

Bainimarama said: "We will not entertain any more demands by
George Speight and his men."
</P>

Bainimarama was quoted as saying in a statement that talks to
try to free 31 government hostages held by Speight at gunpoint
since May 19 had reached deadlock.
</P>
<P>
He said Speight and his men would be granted an amnesty for the
seizure of Fiji's parliament and MPs including Fiji's first ethnic
Indian Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry.
</P>
<P>
But the military would not agree to demands that Speight or his
close supporters be included in an interim civilian government.
</P>
<P>
"We have stated this is impossible," Bainimarama said.
</P>
<P>
"We would like them to leave, have the hostages released and
return all arms so we can bring some normalcy back to our lives,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Bainimarama did not say what would happen if Speight ignored
the ultimatum.
</P>
<P>
But military spokesman Filipo Tarakinikini said talks had
reached a "critical and volatile point."
</P>
<P>
He said no further negotiations were scheduled on Monday with
Speight, but added: "We are still leaving the door open for talks.
"
</P>
<P>
Bainimarama said foreign governments had warned of a major
economic backlash against Fiji if the military agreed to Speight's
demands.
</P>
<P>
The European Union had written to Fiji warning that if Speight
was included in a new government it would not buy Fiji sugar, one
of the Pacific nation's most valuable exports.
</P>
<P>
Bainimarama also said the concerns of Speight and other
indigenous Fijians would be reflected in a new constitution.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the hostages being held in the parliament complex
are well, medical and diplomatic sources said.
</P>
<P>
Speight Sunday night would not say when he would release them,
again declaring they were his trump cards in any negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Australia Deeply Concerned by Solomon Islands Coup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Australia was deeply concerned by
an apparent coup in the Solomon Islands, Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Downer said Solomons Prime Minister Bartholomew Ulufa'alu had
been taken at gunpoint by rebels but was now safe and no longer in
detention.
</P>
<P>
"We are obviously very deeply concerned about what has taken
place during the course of last night," Downer told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"We understand that the governor-general and the prime minister
are both safe," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This has happened after we have made a very substantial effort
to try to stabilize the situation in the Solomon Islands and we
will be continuing to do that," he said.
</P>
<P>
Downer said he understood that no hostages were being held by
the Malaita Eagle Force rebels.
</P>
<P>
"The information that I have now is that the prime minister is
able to move freely around as is the governor-general although
they do have Malaita Eagle Force people with them," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But they are not being confined to any one particular location
or held hostage," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But the leader of the Malaita Eagle Force, Andrew Nori, is
simply insisting that the prime minister resign," Downer said.
</P>
<P>
Downer said it was too early to make any judgments about what
would happen.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister himself has offered to resign last weekend
so what his political fate will be now, we don't exactly know and
that remains to be seen during the course of, presumably, today or
tomorrow," Downer said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Parliament Begins Discussion on Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The first budget session of the
parliament in the new millennium began Monday amid a boycott by
main opposition political parties.
</P>
<P>
The national budget for the fiscal year 2000-2001 will be
presented by Finance Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria on June 8. In
July, 18 treasury bills and 23 private members' bills will be
placed in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The parliament will sit on 36 working days, making it the
longest budget session of the seventh parliament during the Awami
League government.
</P>
<P>
Members of the main opposition parties, the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP), the Jatiya Party and the Jamaat-e-Islami,
have been boycotting the parliament for about a year, and the long
budget session may strip some members of parliament (MPs) of
membership.
</P>
<P>
The country's constitution says an MP would vacate his seat for
absence from parliament, without leave of the parliament, for 90
consecutive sitting days.
</P>
<P>
According to parliament sources, some 15 MPs, including
opposition leader Begum Khaleda Zia and Jatiya Party chief Ershad,
are heading toward the red mark of 90 days' absence that may strip
them of their parliament membership.
</P>
<P>
Once the opposition leaders are stripped of the membership,
another political crisis may be triggered in the country,
observers here said.

<HEADLINE> Pacers Refuse To Be Sacrificial Lamb To Lakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The NBA final series begins Wednesday in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
"We can fine-tune a lot of things that we can do better in
order to become NBA champions," said the Pacers point guard Galen
Rose, the team's scoring leader in the regular season who is
second to Reggie Miller (23.8) in the playoffs with a 20.1 average.
</P>
<P>
For all but two of the Pacers this is the first trip to the NBA
Finals. Reserves Sam Perkins and Zan Tabak are the exceptions and
Tabak was a member of the 1995 Houston Rockets championship team.
</P>
<P>
"The Lakers are certainly a powerful, talented team. Whatever
happens, we've got to be healthy and play our game. We've got to
go out and play relaxed," said Perkins, who has the most playoff
experience of any Pacer with 158 games.
</P>
<P>
"The games in the NBA Finals can be a once in a lifetime
experience." he added.
</P>
<P>
The Pacers reached the NBA Finals by beating the New York
Knicks, the team that eliminated the Pacers twice in their
previous four trips to the conference
finals, in Game 6 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, the Pacers center Rik Smits who is averaging 11.3
points and 3.4 rebounds in this year's playoffs, was anticipating
a tough matchup against the Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
"You've got to try and keep him away from the basket, try to
limit his touches," Smits said of the 7-1, 315-pound O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers center took league-leading playoff averages of 28.8
points and 15.4 rebounds into Sunday night's game. The league's
MVP led the NBA with a 29.7 point average and a .574 percentage
from the field during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
A key player for the Pacers in the NBA Finals will be Dale
Davis, the team's rebounding leader.
</P>
<P>
"With Shaq it is going to be tough to get rebounds. He's big,
he's strong and he's effective under the basket," Davis said. "Now
there's a hungry feeling for us. We're right there, and now we
have to have a little faith."
</P>
<P>
The Lakers finally earned a berth in the NBA Finals Sunday
evening by rallying for an 89-84 victory over the Portland Trail
Blazers in Game 7 of the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, on the verge of losing three straight games for the
first time all season, scored 15 consecutive points in the fourth
quarter to erase a 15-point Blazers lead.
</P>
<P>
O'Neal, rendered ineffective most of the game by Blazers'
double- and triple-teaming defense, scored nine points in the
fourth quarter, punctuating the rally with a thundering dunk on a
lob pass from Kobe Bryant that put the Lakers ahead 85-79 with 40
seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
The usually unemotional O'Neal waved his index fingers at the
crowd with an amazed expression on his face as he ran downcourt.
</P>
<P>
O'Neal had 18 points and nine rebounds and was 8-of-12 from the
free throws line, including two that tied the game 77-77 with 2:44
to play.
</P>
<P>
Bryant, the other half of the superstar tandem that is supposed
to lead this franchise back to its historic greatness, had 25
points and 11 rebounds. Bryant, who made just six of 12 free
throws in the game, made two to put Los Angeles ahead for good, 81-
79 with 1:34 remaining.
</P>
<P>
Rasheed Wallace scored 30 points on 13-for-26 shooting but had
six of the Blazers' 13 consecutive misses during the Lakers' run
that wiped out a 75-60 lead. Wallace also missed two free throws
with Blazers trailing 81-79 with 1:25 to go.
</P>
<P>
Scottie Pippen, brought to Portland to provide the leadership
the team needed to win a championship, fouled out with 25 seconds
to go with 12 points and 10 rebounds. He was just 3-of-10 from the
field.
</P>
<P>
The Blazers, who had beaten the Lakers twice in Los Angeles in
the playoffs, were trying to become the seventh team to come back
from being down 3-1 to win a series and the first to do it in the
conference finals. Most of Sunday evening, they looked as if they
would.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers and the Pacers will fight for the first NBA champion
in the new millennium. The Game 1 will start on Wednesday in the
Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> Jakarta to Hold Miss Indonesia Contest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Miss Indonesia beauty contest
is to be held here this week after a four-year gap, according to
chairwoman of the Miss Indonesia Foundation Mooryati Soedibyo.
</P>
<P>
She said the fifth contest, from June 7 to 10, would be
attended by 30 girls from 25 of the country's 26 provinces and the
newly elected Miss Universe 2000 from India Lara Dutta is expected
to join in.
</P>
<P>
"The contestants will be judged based on their intellectual
ability, behavior and beauty," Mooryati was quoted by the Jakarta
Post Monday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The grand finale of the beauty contest would be held next
Saturday at the Taman Mini Indonesia Indah (Beautiful Indonesia in
Miniature Park) and be attended by some 1,000 people, said
Mooryati, a businesswoman who runs a cosmetics company.
</P>
<P>
State Minister for Women's Empowerment Khofifah Indar Parawansa
said the government supported the event.
</P>
<P>
She said contests such as these should view women an asset, not
a commodity to be exploited. The minister also said the urine of
each candidate would be checked to make sure that she was not a
drug user.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Tourism and the Arts Hidayat Jaelani said he hoped
the event would help restore the country's image, which had been
badly tarnished by social unrest and political uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
He said the winner of Miss Indonesia would represent the
country as a tourist ambassador at international events.
</P>
<P>
Beauty contests were banned by the government of former
president Soeharto on the grounds that they treated women as
objects and were against religious and Eastern values in general.

<P>
COLOMBO, June 5 (Xinhua) -- At least two people were killed and
three others injured Sunday evening when a train collided with a
car carrying five people at an unprotected railway crossing at
Kapuwatta in Western Province of Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The train bound for Puttalam from Colombo reduced speed closer
to Kapuwatta but the driver of the motor car was unable to move
off from the unprotected railway crossing, eye witnesses were
quoted by the Island Sunday newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The three injured were in a critical condition.
</P>
<P>
An investigation into the cause of the accident is under way,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Unprotected railway crossings claim several hundred lives each
year in the country.
</P>
<P>
About 15 years ago, then prime minister Ranasinghe Premadasa
ordered that make-shift barriers be constructed and manned at
every unprotected railway crossing in the country.
</P>
<P>
The measure had brought the death toll down. However, before
long the make-shift barriers have again been neglected and many of
them do not function, causing such accidents to rise again.

<P>
Speaking at a ceremony here Sunday observing the Year 2000
World Environment Day which falls on Monday, Myanmar Foreign
Minister U Win Aung stressed the vital need to have a spirit of
global partnership to address the environmental problems that
confront humanity, warning that many of the problems are
transboundary in nature, the New Light of Myanmar newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Despite some remarkable improvements in the global system of
environmental management, the world's environment is still under
stress and there are still many outstanding challenges in the

Win Aung, who is also chairman of the Myanmar National
Commission for Environmental Affairs (NCEA), called for acting
right now for achieving sustainable development.

over the past decade paid increased attention to environmental
protection and initiated many important programs and projects to
protect and conserve the country's rich natural resources with
sustainable management of forests, land and mineral resources
being promoted.
</P>
<P>
In order to prevent and arrest land and forest degradation, the
government has launched special projects including the greening of
the dry zone.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the NCEA formulated the Myanmar Agenda 21 in 1997,
in which many important programs and activities for sustainable
development are outlined.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that Myanmar will never disregard the eco-systems
of the country in its economic development endeavors, emphasizing
that progress must go hand-in-hand with the preservation and
protection of the country's natural conditions and resources.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar marks the World Environment Day every year with various
activities including photo, poster and essay contests to raise

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar, which established
diplomatic relations with China on June 8, 1950, was among the
first countries which made the move.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 50 years, bilateral relations between the two
countries have stood the test of the changing international
political climate, growing steadily.
</P>
<P>
China and Myanmar share identical or similar views on many
major international issues, supporting each other and cooperating

</P>
<P>
The mutual trust and support politically have become an
important cornerstone for the development of friendly and

In the past 50 years, Myanmar has consistently supported China'
s solemn stand in safeguarding its state sovereignty and
territorial integrity.

Myanmar recognizes that the government of the People's Republic
of China is the sole legitimate government representing the whole
of China and that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's
territory.
</P>
<P>
The frequent exchanges of visits by leaders of China and
Myanmar have signified the steady development of the two countries
' bilateral ties. These visits have pushed ahead the smooth
development of the two countries' political and economic ties.
</P>
<P>
In bilateral cooperation in the sectors of economy and
technology, remarkable progress has been made.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, China and
Myanmar have signed three agreements on economic and technical
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China has carried out dozens of construction projects in
Myanmar. These include a sugar mill, a paper mill, a textile mill,
a plywood factory, a ball factory, a thermal power plant, a rice
mill, a national theater, a national stadium, and the Yangon-
Thanlyin highway and railway combined bridge. The projects are
playing an important role in Myanmar's economic development.
</P>
<P>
In addition to economic assistance, the two countries have also
launched other forms of economic cooperation. Chinese companies
have initiated a number of contracted projects in Myanmar, with
some in the form of wholly Chinese investment or joint venture.
More than 10 Chinese enterprises have already been set up in
Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
In the trade sector, Myanmar is one of the main importing
countries of China's consumer goods and electrical household
appliances. China is now Myanmar's second largest trading partner
with annual bilateral trade amounting to about 600 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Border trade is an important supplement to China-Myanmar
bilateral trade. The two countries have opened on their respective
sides nine border trade points, greatly enhancing bilateral trade.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Solomon Islands' Labor Party
leader said the country's prime minister has been held captive
since 6:00 a.m. (local time) Monday as part of a coup unfolding in
the capital Honiara, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The ABC quoted Joses Tuhanuku, a former Solomon Islands' MP who
is presently in Canberra, as saying he was in contact with
colleagues in Honiara before phone lines were cut off.
</P>
<P>
He said the coup was sparked by similar events in Fiji and he
has been told a group calling themselves the Malaita Eagle Force
is responsible.
</P>
<P>
"There are two ethnic groups that have been in conflict over
land issues and it's not very clear yet over what the demands are
and who may be really responsible, but the little bit I heard from
home is that the prime minister has been held since 6:00 a.m.," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The office of Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said
Australia has been in contact with sources from the Solomon
Islands' government.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from the strong
earthquake which hit Indonesia's Bengkulu on the western Sumatran
coast on late Sunday night rose to 40, according to the Antara
News Agency Monday.
</P>
<P>
The quake, measuring 7.9 on the Richter Scale, hit Bengkulu at
23:28 p.m. local time (1628 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Widespread panic was reported in Bengkulu, a city of about 1.2
million, as people dug through the rubble of ruined buildings in
search of bodies and trapped survivors.
</P>
<P>
Antara quoted witnesses as saying that hospitals, overcrowded
with injured people, were struggling to cope as few staff members
had arrived at work on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
The death toll was expected to rise as volunteers and emergency
workers searched through ruined buildings.
</P>
<P>
"Many houses have collapsed, and the walls on bigger buildings
have been fractured. I helped save three of my neighbors who were
trapped under rubble," a resident of Bengkulu Edy was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian seismologists said the tremor was centered beneath
the Indian Ocean, 650 kilometers northwest of Jakarta. A magnitude
6 aftershock hit 11 minutes after the quake, and 53 smaller
tremors were recorded before 06:00 a.m. Monday (2300 Sunday GMT),
frightening residents and hampering rescuers.
</P>
<P>
Damage also was reported at Bengkulu Airport.
</P>
<P>
The quake, one of the strongest recorded in Indonesia in recent
years, was felt across much of the western half of the country,
including Jakarta.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Project Does not Affect River Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The construction of the Three
Gorges project has not affected the quality of water of the
Yangtze River, according to a release here today.
</P>
<P>
The release by the State Environmental Protection
Administration of China (SEPA) said the quality in the trunk river
of the Yangtze remains good, or up to level II or III despite
large-scale building of the dam area near Yichang city of Hubei
Province, central China.
</P>
<P>
"The Bulletin on the Ecology and Environment in the Three
Gorges Area of the Yangtze River in 1999", jointly compiled by the
SEPA and nine other government departments and research groups,
said progress was reported in urban waste water treatment, and
garbage disposal and discharge of pollutants into the river and
its tributaries have decreased.
</P>
<P>
White-flag dolphins, Chinese sturgeons and other endangered
species have been well protected, it added.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the bulletin pointed out, environmental problems remain in
the future reservoir region with a population of nearly 20 million,
such as rural energy shortage, continuing decrease of fuel forest
and serious loss of water and soil.
</P>
<P>
Random dumping of garbage into the river by ships and
landslides and other geological accidents are not rare and the
construction of urban waste water and garbage treatment facilities
is going very slow, said the 44-page bulletin in eight chapters.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt to Take Stern Actions Against Separatist Activities in Irian Jaya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid and Indonesian Military (TNI) chief Widodo have pledged to
take stern measures against the Papuans (Irian Jaya) for declaring
independence, House of Representatives Speaker Akbar Tanjung said.
</P>
<P>
The House would support every means sought by the government to
maintain the state's unity, Akbar said on Sunday in Pangkalpinang,
South Sumatra province.
</P>
<P>
"I have phoned Wahid and asked him not to hesitate in taking
strict action to keep the country's territorial integrity,"
reports reaching here Monday quoted the House speaker as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I also have phoned TNI chief Widodo to discuss the same thing
I did with President Wahid," Akbar added.
</P>
<P>
The week-long "Papua National Congress" ended on Sunday in
Jayapura, capital of Papua province, with the adoption of a
resolution declaring Papua's incorporation into Indonesia in the
1960s invalid and stating that the resource-rich province is an
independence state.
</P>
<P>
Pro-independence leader Theys Eluay told the congress that
Papua would aim to seek independence through negotiations and
peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
The House speaker added that President Wahid has ordered the
TNI chief to take effective steps to prevent such a movement from
leading to separatism.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Wahid has summoned the ambassadors of Britain,
the United States, the Netherlands and Australia to explain their
governments' stance in dealing with the Papua problem.
</P>
<P>
Australia and the Netherlands have stated their support for
Indonesia's national integrity, said Akbar.
</P>
<P>
Wahid said over the weekend that most people in the province
want to remain part of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Papua (Irian Jaya) is the largest island in Indonesia with a
population of about two million.
</P>
<P>
In 1963, then president Sukarno led Indonesia's fight to regain
the mineral-rich territory from the Netherlands. It was officially
integrated into Indonesia after a U.N.-sponsored plebiscite in
1969.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Department of Foreign
Affairs and Trade Monday morning confirmed armed groups had
overrun key installations in Honiara, capital of the Solomon
Islands overnight, in an apparent coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the Malaita Eagle Force rebel group have taken over
key installations in Honiara including some police stations and
the Government Telecommunications Center," the department said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Armed rebels have taken control of major intersections in
Honiara," the department said.
</P>
<P>
"These actions represent a significant deterioration in the
tensions between ethnic groups reported in previous travel
advisories," the department said.
</P>
<P>
Australians have been warned to defer travel to the South
Pacific nation.
</P>
<P>
Australians currently in Honiara should stay indoors, exercise
a high level of personal security awareness and await further
advice, the department said.
</P>
<P>
But the department could not confirm a report that the rebels
had taken Prime Minister Bartholomew Ulufa'alu hostage.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer
said information was still being sought by the government.
</P>
<P>
Downer could make a statement later Monday, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Associated Press (AAP) quoted Solomon Islands
civil aviation department sources as saying that an attempted coup
is underway with a rebel militia group placing the prime minister
under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
Telephone lines to the island nation have been cut and the
airport closed, the civil aviation department was quoted by the
AAP as saying.
</P>
<P>
The department's flight operations center at Honiara airport
said the rebels had raided a police armory and were in control of
the streets of the capital.
</P>
<P>
"All flights in and out of Honiara have been suspended until
further notice...this includes domestic operations," the
department said.
</P>
<P>
The Malaita Eagles are one of two rival groups who have been
fighting for more than 18 months.
</P>
<P>
About 60 people have been killed in the fighting. The other
group is known as the Istabu Revolutionary Front.

<P>
OTTAWA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The 30th General Assembly of the
Organization of American States (OAS) opened late Sunday in
Canada's southern city of Windsor.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony of the three-day session attended by
foreign ministers from 34 member states, Canadian Prime Minister
Jean Chretien appealed for pooling wisdom to capture the potential
of new technology and other transformations and give them a human
face.
</P>
<P>
"In recent years, we have seen an explosion of new technology,
breaking down old constraints of time and distance, sweeping away
traditional economic structures and assumptions and creating a new
economy, in which knowledge, innovation and creativity are the
keys to prosperity," said Chretien.
</P>
<P>
He also called for intensified joint efforts to establish the
Free Trade Area of the Americas by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
He said that "enhanced trade and investment flows are the
engines of economic growth and prosperity."
</P>
<P>
Chretien expressed the hope that the OAS summit to be held next
spring in Canada's Quebec City "will mark yet another historic
milestone on the road to making the Americas more free, more
secure and more prosperous."
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the first of its kind to be held in Canada since
it joined the organization in 1990, will focus on "human security
issues, including democracy, human rights, war-affected children,
corporate social responsibility, and threats to people from the
illicit trade in drugs and other crimes," according to Canadian
Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
Up to 4,000 Canadian and U.S. police are being deployed in the
border city to brace for any attempts by thousands of protesters
to shut down the meeting in their anti-free-trade demonstration.
</P>
<P>
At least three protesters were reported to be pepper sprayed in
the face in their first clash with police Sunday.

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Psychological problems are
becoming alarmingly more common among Chinese children of divorced
parents, according to a survey of students in Shijiazhuang No. 11
Middle School in north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
One hundred percent of the 122 students from broken families,
or 8.8 percent of the total 1,380 students surveyed, were
diagnosed by doctors as suffering from one or more of the eight
symptoms in terms of psychological distress including anxiety,
fear or loneliness. The proportion of students with the same
complaints from two-parent families was 20.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that 58 percent of the 122 students exhibited
six or more symptoms of the eight psychological distresses.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that single parents are often either
excessively strict or lenient with their children, or just
indifferent to them.
</P>
<P>
China's divorce rate has risen to ten percent, according to

SHIJIAZHUANG, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese researchers have
succeeded in shortening the breeding period of winter wheat from
the original eight to 10 years to just two years.
</P>
<P>
This feat was recognized as the fastest bio-breeding
accomplishment in the world by scientists including Li Zhensheng
and Zhuang Qiaosheng, academicians of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences (CAS), China's top research body of natural sciences, and
Fan Liuyun, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE)
.
</P>
<P>
Xie Xiaoliang, an expert who has been involved in the project,
said that they started the research ten years ago with an
expectation of increasing grain production. Developing fast-
breeding quality wheat, however, is now a major goal of their work.
</P>
<P>
"The aim of our study now is to get new wheat varieties that
can be planted in most places within just one or two years," Xie
said, adding that that the speedy bio-breeding technology can also
be used for breeding other plants.

<HEADLINE> NMD System Hinders Nuke Disarmament: China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua)-- The United States' development of a
missile shield would upset the world strategic balance and hinder
the process of international nuclear disarmament, today's China
Daily quoted a senior Chinese official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sha Zukang, director-general of the Department of Arms Control
and Disarmament of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told the
newspaper that the U.S. development of a so-called National
Missile Defence (NMD) system "would be tantamount to a nuclear
arms build up."
</P>
<P>
Sha said that the missile shield would "severely damage" the
integrity and vitality of the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty
and global strategic balance and stability.
</P>
<P>
Also threatened would be the basis for US-Russia bilateral
nuclear reductions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Given the significant role of the United States and Russia, two
nations with the biggest nuclear arsenals in the world, the U.S.
action would impede the international nuclear disarmament process,
and, in turn, shatter the prerequisite and basis for international
nuclear non-proliferation, Sha said.
</P>
<P>
Russia, after ratifying the Strategic Arms Reduction (START II)
accord early this year, declared that if the United States
undermines the 1972 ABM treaty, it will withdraw other arms
control agreements.

<P>
China has on several occasions warned that the United States'
insistence on NMD system development would inevitably affect China
's arms control policy.
</P>
<P>
Sha stressed that China would only participate in arms control
negotiations, particularly those on nuclear arms control.
</P>
<P>
China is the only one of five nuclear powers that pledges no-
first-use of nuclear weapons. It has also promised that it would
never use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear
weapons states or nuclear-weapons free zones.
</P>
<P>
Disarmament should be conducive to the enhancement of all
countries' common security, never becoming a tool employed by a
few States to strengthen their military superiority," said Sha.

<P>
JAKARTA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A strong earthquake measuring 7.9
on the Richter Scale hit Bengkulu on Sunday night, killing at
least 20 people and injuring scores of others, according to
reports reaching here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The first tremors hit at 23:28 p.m. (1628 GMT) on Sunday and
lasted for a few minutes, followed by several strong aftershocks.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted the U.S. Geological Survey as saying that
the quake was centered 33 kilometers below the earth's surface in
the Indian Ocean about 110 kilometers southwest of Bengkulu on the
western Sumatran coast.

The Antara News Agency said that there was an atmosphere of
panic in Bengkulu, a city of about 1.2 million, after the quake
hit. Residents of the city had rushed from their houses and many
stayed out in the open overnight.
</P>
<P>
Several buildings in the Bengkulu city collapsed and rescuers
were searching for people buried in the rubble during the quake,

The militia is also said to have taken the prime minister
hostage, along with an unspecified number of other people, the ABC

<HEADLINE> Military in Charge of Fiji: TV Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Fijian military said on Monday
it was firmly in charge of Fiji while continuing to negotiate with
coup leader George Speight, Australia's Nine TV Network reported.
</P>
<P>
When asked who was running Fiji, a military spokesman confirmed
the military was in control.
</P>
<P>
Fijian military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Filipo
Tarakinikini told the network's Today show that the military line
had been drawn and Speight must agree to their demands.
</P>
<P>
"The military line has been drawn and we have told Mr. Speight
and his group that beyond this we are not going to negotiate," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The hostages should be returned, weapons, ammunition returned
and the military bring back normalcy back to the whole country,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"And this can last maybe up to three months at the most and
then we will divert back to the Great Council of Chiefs and from
then on an interim civilian administration," he added.
</P>
<P>
Surrender of any weapons in the parliamentary complex was now a
prerequisite, he said.
</P>
<P>
Speight Sunday night again refused to say when he would release
his hostages, but said talks with Fiji's interim military
government aimed at freeing the captives and deciding Fiji's
political future were going well.
</P>
<P>
The Great Council of Chiefs will be asked to decide whether to
back continued military rule or a Speight-aligned civilian
government.
</P>
<P>
Since Speight seized parliament, Fiji's elected government and
its president have been removed, its constitution revoked and
military rule enforced.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Ends Work to Set Line to Verify Israeli Pullout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 5 (Xinhua) -- U.N. special envoy Terje Roed-Larsen
announced here Monday night that U.N. cartographers have confirmed
the line that will be used to verify Israel's withdrawal form south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Larsen told reporters following his talks with Lebanese leaders
that the U.N. team has wrapped up setting the line between Israel
and Lebanon. "The U.N. will verify whether Israel's withdrawal from
south Lebanon is complete or not according to the line," Larsen
added.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.N. experts will end their work on some concerning
part along the line.
</P>
<P>
Larsen will meet Lebanese President Emile Lahoud and Prime
Minister Salim Hoss Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He did not mention three areas along the Israeli-Lebanese
border, which are under Israeli control but claimed by Lebanon.
Neither did he talk about the disputed Shebaa Farms over which
Beirut says it has ownership.
</P>
<P>
The 200-square kilometer, fertile Shebaa area is located on the
west side of Mount Hermon, which is under Israeli occupation.
Israel argues that the Shebaa Farms belong to Syria, and that a
withdrawal from the area would be considered in peace talks with
Damascus when they resume.
</P>
<P>
Local radio quoted a government source as saying that Beirut has
agreed to deal with this issue in separate fashion after Larsen's
visit to Syria and his talks with Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh.
</P>
<P>
Syria is the main power broker in Lebanon. Its peace
negotiations with Israel has been stalled in February due to
Israel's refusal to promise the full return of the Golan Heights it
captured in 1967 Middle East war.

<HEADLINE> Barak Halts Negotiations with Shas over Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
ordered Monday to stop the negotiations with the ultra-Orthodox
Jewish Shas Party over its demands for more government money for
its financially ailing educational network.
</P>
<P>
The move came in response to threats by the powerful religious
party to support Knesset (Parliament) member Avigdor Liberman's
bill proposal for early elections, which will be brought to a vote
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We will not act under threats," Barak said.
</P>
<P>
Shas party, which holds 17 seats in the 120-member Knesset, has
been in a long-time feud with the left-wing Meretz Party over
funding and control of the Shas religious school system, the power
base of the relatively young political force that has grown up
suddenly in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The wrangling between Shas, the third largest party after Labor
and Likud in the ruling coalition, and the fourth-largest party
Meretz, has touched off a 10-month-long coalition crisis which
rattled Barak's fragile coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Shas had blamed Education Minister Yossi Sarid of the Meretz
Party for refusing to allocate enough funds to cover Shas'
financial deficits in its ailing educational system, while Sarid
argued that the system management was corrupt and should be
reformed first. 
</P>
<P>
The disputes were resolved temporarily before last December's
state budget vote after the two sides signed a restructuring deal
regarding the issue.
</P>
<P>
Later, Shas again updated its demand list by urging Sarid to
hand over the control of the ultra-Orthodox school system to his
deputy Meshulam Nahari, who is a Shas member.
</P>
<P>
Sarid, vehemently opposed to reopening the deal, has warned that
his party could bolt the government if Barak orders him to open
Education Ministry coffers further for Shas schools.
</P>
<P>
Barak has been working hard but in vain to forge compromise
proposals to end the crisis between the two irreconcilable ruling
partners, both of which are pivotal for the stability of the ruling
coalition.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who holds a 68-52 seat majority in the parliament, is now
engaged in talks with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
who arrived here on Monday to boost the lagging Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Envoy Underlines Anti-Terrorism Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister
Mohammad Hossein Adeli on Monday rebuffed allegations that Tehran
wants to destabilize Turkey through a series of political killings,
reported Turkey's Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Adeli, who came to Turkey to invite Turkish President Ahmet
Necdet
Sezer to attend the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) summit
to be held in Tehran on June 10, told reporters that it was simply
not in the Iranian interests to have relations with Turkey
overshadowed by terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He expressed Iran's disappointment at the press reports
vilifying
Iran for destabilizing Turkey, adding that the two countries should
make utmost efforts to keep calm while dealing with temporary
problems.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been the target of growing criticism in recent weeks
after Turkish police leaked stories that several leading Turkish
intellectuals were assassinated by Iranian agents in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
However, it turned out later that the accusations against Iran
were overplayed in the press.
</P>
<P>
In view of the new development, it was reported, Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit and Foreign Minister Ismail Cem last Tuesday advised
the newly-elected president to attend the ECO summit which will
also be attended by important leaders from Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
During his brief stay in Ankara, Adeli met Foreign Ministry
Deputy Undersecretary Mithat Balkan, mainly discussing his mission
in the capacity of a special envoy to convey Khatami's invitation
to Sezer.
</P>
<P>
Underscoring the significance of the Iranian president's
message, the emissary noted that confidence should be built up
among different cultures and people of the world.

<HEADLINE> FCC Gives Conditional Approval to AT&AMP;T's Purchase of MediaOne </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. federal regulators on
Monday gave conditional clearance to AT&AMP;T Corp.'s proposed
purchase of MediaOne, a deal that makes the nation's top long-
distance carrier also the top cable company.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) conditioned its
approval on AT&AMP;T shedding some assets so that it would comply with
federal rules that limit how many customers a single cable company
can reach. AT&AMP;T has one year to complete the necessary divesture.
</P>
<P>
FCC approval is the final regulatory hurdle. Two weeks ago, The
Justice Department had signed off on the deal, originally valued
at 58 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The merger will further AT&AMP;T's plan to offer high-speed
Internet access, local phone service and television programming
directly into homes using cable TV lines. That allows them to
bypass the phone networks owned by the Bell companies to bring
these services to consumers.
</P>
<P>
Under the commission's action, AT&AMP;T has three options for
coming under the federal ownership limits. It can get rid of
MediaOne's 25 percent interest in cable systems owned by Time
Warner, it could shed programming interests that sell to Time
Warner's cable system, or it could get rid of more than 9.7
million of its cable subscribers.
</P>
<P>
FCC rules forbid one company from controlling more than 30
percent of the multichannel video market, which includes cable and
competitors such as direct broadcast satellite. The limits are
meant to ensure that consumers have a diversity of content
available to them.
</P>
<P>
FCC Chairman William Kennard said the commission action would
promote competition in the local phone markets while protecting
consumer interests in high-speed Internet service and cable TV
programming.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Urges Lifting of Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Sudan Monday urged the
United Nations Security Council to lift the sanctions which have
been in place since 1996.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the president of the United Nations Security
Council, Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail said his
country had made sincere and pragmatic efforts to comply with the
demands made upon it.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said inquiries in the past years had shown
that no trace was found of the three suspects in the Sudan, who
are accused for the 1995 assassination attempt against Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister listed a series of steps that Sudan had
taken since the United Nations Security Council called on it to
desist from engaging in terrorist activities and to improve its
relations with its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Ismail urged the president of the Security Council to convene a
special meeting in order to lift the sanctions imposed on the
country in the light of the practical and concrete measures that
the Sudanese government has taken to meet the Council's demands.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions, imposed in May 1996, require all states to
reduce the number of Sudanese diplomatic personnel on their
territory and to restrict the entry or transit of Sudanese
governmental officials.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council also decided in August 1996 to impose
sanctions against flights by Sudanese aircraft.

<P>
NEW YORK, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A China Textiles and Garment Trade
Show opened here Monday in what is the first Chinese professional
textiles and garment fair in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The event, "Year 2000 China Textiles and Garment Trade Show,"
attracted some 206 enterprises from 25 Chinese provinces and
cities in an exhibition area of 5,000 square meters.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Wang Tiankai, deputy
director of the China Textile and Industrial Bureau, said, "China
and the United States are key trading partners. The two countries
are highly complementary to each other in the economic field."
</P>
<P>
"This expo is mainly designed for the better understanding on
the American market for Chinese textiles and garment enterprises
in a more direct way so as to provide better services in trade
exchanges," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, through widespread contact with American
enterprises, they can seek opportunities for cooperation on
capital, technology and other means from American enterprises, so
that the trade and commerce of two countries would be expanded and
the economic growth of the two countries be benefited," he said.
</P>
<P>
"With fast development of worldwide science and technology,
and the further progress of the economic globalization, the Sino-
American connections in economy, technology and trade should not
only be further strengthened, but also be promoted to maturity,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhaoxing, Chinese ambassador to the United States,
Ambassador Shen Guofang, deputy Chinese representative to the
United Nations, and Ambassador Zhang Hongxi, Chinese consul
general in New York, were present at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the China's Sub-Council of Textile Industry and
the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, the
show will end Wednesday. It was supported by the U.S. Specialty
Trade Shows and the Fully Youthful Enterprise.
</P>
<P>
Textile industry is a major pillar of China's national economy,
and China's textile industry has kept vigorous vitality thanks to
the nation's reform and opening to the outside world campaign.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Assembly Holds First Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The order of business on Monday included a motion by the
Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) that the Union Flag should fly
from government buildings on designated days.
</P>
<P>
The party has tabled a motion to compel Sinn Fein ministers,
Martin McGuinness and Bairbre de Brun to fly the Union Flag from
their departmental headquarters on those days.
</P>
<P>
McGuinness, who is Northern Ireland's education minister, and
Ms. De Brun, who is health minister, angered unionists on Friday
by ordering their civil servants not to fly the flag which was
part of the celebration of the anniversary of Queen Elizabeth's
coronation.
</P>
<P>
The DUP leader, Ian Paisley, who has tabled the motion with
party colleague and social development minister Nigel Dodds,
branded Sinn Fein's actions "a disgrace".
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams said in Belfast that the first
meeting of the assembly marked "another effort to make these
institutions work". "There has been three months lost in which a
lot of valuable work could have been done," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Deputy First Minister Seamus Mallon said he believed
the flags issue could be resolved.
</P>
<P>
Britain boosted the flagging peace process last week by
restoring home-rule powers to the assembly and a 12-member cabinet,
which it suspended in February over the Irish Republican Army's (
IRA) failure to disarm.

<HEADLINE> Eurostar Bullet Train Derails in Northern France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A Eurostar bullet train running at
300 kilometers per hour from Paris to London derailed Monday
afternoon near Arras in Pas-de-Calais, northern France, said
French officials.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen people were slightly injured in the accident, which
took place at 17:45 local time (15:5 GMT), said the French state
railway company SNCF.
</P>
<P>
Only two bogies went out of the rails while the whole body of
the train, which had 501 passengers on board, remained on the
track, said SNCF.
</P>
<P>
After the accident took place, SNCF shifted all the other
Eurostar trains to the classic tracks going through the English
channel and the passengers of the derailed train were transported
by bus to the nearby city of Lille, where they took a special
train for Britain.
</P>
<P>
French officials said that the cause of the accident has not
been found and Minister of Transport Jean-Claude Gayssot has
ordered all the personnel of SNCF to stay vigilant to meet "extra
requests of security in railway operation."
</P>
<P>
The derailment of the Eurostar took place one day after a
railway was sabotaged in Isere, southeast France, by an Algerian
man who was said to be mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
The sabotage caused the derailment of an international train
from Vintimille, Italy, to Calais, northern France, killing two
people and injuring a dozen others.

MEXICO CITY, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Health ministers of World
Health Organization (WHO) countries signed Monday in Mexico's
capital the Mexico Declaration for promoting world health
development.
</P>
<P>
Ministers signed this declaration during the inaugural ceremony
of the 5th World Conference of Health Promotion Mexico-2000, that

</P>
<P>
In the joint statement the participating ministers concluded
that health promotion must be a fundamental part of health
policies and programs in all countries in the search for fairness
and better health for all.
</P>
<P>
They considered that the promotion of sanitary and health
development is a top priority, as well as a governmental
responsibility.
</P>

community in implementing policies and proclamations.

genuine political will at all levels was essential, Njie Saidy
added.

The special session, also called Beijing +5, is a follow-up to
the Fourth World Conference on Women. The special session will
focus on examples of good practices, positive actions, lessons

<HEADLINE> Tanzania, Rwanda Agree to Maintain Regional Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian and Rwandan defense
 ministers agreed here on Monday to collaborate in attaining peace
in the Great Lakes region to benefit economic activities.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting held in the Defense Ministry, Tanzanian
Minister of Defense Maokola Majogo and his visiting Rwandan
counterpart Emmanual Habyarimana said that they want to foster a
friendly bilateral relationship on defense and security matters.
</P>
<P>
"If there is peace and security within the area, people will
live in peace and economic development activities will take place
without hindrance, " Majogo told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of regular meetings of the two
country's defense ministers and their chief of defense forces on
security matters as well as exchange of officers for training.
</P>
<P>
Habyarimana said that he expected to learn more from Tanzania
experience on matters of defense and security.
</P>
<P>
He also talked about the situation in Kisangani in the eastern
part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and denied claims
that there are Rwandan troops stationed in neighboring Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The visit of Habyarimana, who was accompanied by Rwandan Chief
of Security Lieutenant Colonel Patrick Kalegeya and other
officers, is seen as another positive development in the peace
efforts in the region following a summit between presidents
Laurent Kabila of the DRC and Paul Kagame of Rwanda over the
weekend in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents, at the invitation of Kenyan President
Daniel arap Moi, met in Eldoret town and resolved to work together

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Army Vehicle Ambushed in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- A vehicle belonging to the Uganda
People's Defense Forces (UPDF) was ambushed and burnt Monday
morning in Kisangani, a northeast city of the Democratic Republic
of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
The vehicle was ambushed at a T-junction at Kabondo on its way
back from a mission of sending logistics to UPDF members at the
Bangoka Airport, said a press release signed by State Minister for
Defense Steven Kavuma.
</P>
<P>
The UPDF vehicle, which was escorted by a vehicle of the United
Nations Observer Mission in Congo (MONUC), was attacked by small
arms at first and then by rocket-propelled grenades which
destroyed it, the release said, adding that the MONUC vehicle
drove through the ambush successfully.
</P>
<P>
Later there was firing directed to Kapalata, a UPDF position
across the Tshopo River, compelling UPDF to respond, the release
said, stressing that the UPDF shelling was aimed at positions
where the original shelling started.
</P>
<P>
Kavuma could not readily confirm who attacked the UPDF vehicle
but he said it must have been forces not very much amused by
demilitarization of Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the demilitarization of Kisangani
appeared to proceed successfully through the first phase which
ended last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
UPDF remains committed to the demilitarization of Kisangani and
the total observance of all the provisions of the Lusaka
cease-fire agreement, he said.

<HEADLINE> Mandela to Meet Burundian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Nelson Mandela, former South
African president and now chief mediator for Burundi's peace
process, is to meet Burundian President Pierre Buyoya and Defense
Minister Cyrille Ndayirukiye here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The talks come ahead of a planned visit by Mandela to Burundi
later this month to meet with armed groups and people in the
country's controversial regroupment camps, reported South African
Press Association on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's office declined to elaborate on the talks with Buyoya
and Ndayirukiye, only saying they are part of the ongoing peace
process.
</P>
<P>
However, Mandela himself said earlier this month that he would
demand Bujumbura to lift the restrictions imposed on the political
opposition parties and the media in the war-torn African country.
</P>
<P>
The 81-year-old statesman last month held separate closed-door
discussions with rebel groups and Burundi government
representatives to woo their support for his peace initiative.
</P>
<P>
The Burundi peace process has dragged on for two years, with
violence continuing on the ground, but Mandela is now trying to
force the pace by drawing up a series of compromise proposals
based on the negotiations, hoping for an agreement in July.
</P>
<P>
War broke out in Burundi in 1993, pitting several rebel Hutu
factions against the Tutsi-dominated government and army.
</P>
<P>
Hutus represent 85 percent of Burundi's population, but are
mostly peasants and farmers.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Former South African president
Nelson Mandela launched here on Monday the Shell Foundation by
introducing the new charity organization's two pilot projects to
improve energy service delivery to the rural poor.
</P>
<P>
The first project, to be run by the Energy and Development
Research Center in Cape Town, includes a monitoring and evaluation
program to support the government's off-grid rural electrification
initiative, the petroleum giant said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the project will enhance long-term
community sustainability by providing rural residents access to
the relevant resources to build economic and social capacity.
</P>
<P>
The other program will monitor and contribute to the creation
of clean development mechanisms, which will be administered by
the South African Mineral and Energy Policy Center, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
"One of the major issues in South Africa and the developing
world is access to energy and clean, affordable sources of power,"
Mandela said, adding that "I'm delighted that Shell will encourage
the use of sustainable energy sources."

<HEADLINE> S. Africans Urged to Manage Waste Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Plastic bags are only the tip
of the iceberg of South Africa's waste management problem, said
Environment Minister Valli Moosa at a World Environment Day event
in Cape Town on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Although these are the most visible problem, they are not the
only one, he told an audience that included school children and
models dressed in recycled plastic fashions.
</P>
<P>
The big problem is the way South Africa mismanaged its waste
and the " don't care attitude" of consumers who simply tossed
their waste out of their yard or dumped it on street corners, he
said, noting that this attitude will take a long time to overcome.
</P>
<P>
Comparing to the fact that Denmark recycles up to 95 percent of
its waste annually, the figure for South Africa is only 3 or 4
percent and the remaining 96 percent goes into landfill sites, or
can be found in rivers, streams, wetlands "and generally lying
around all over the show", the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Moosa, who last month published draft regulations to outlaw
conventional thin plastic shopping bags, said he does not intend
to rush in an authoritarian way with legislation to ban plastic
bags completely or to set up a "plastic bag unit" in the police.
</P>
<P>
He said he would like to give adequate opportunity for changes
to happen through the development of a social conscience.
</P>
<P>
An African renaissance or rebirth could only happen if it is
associated with citizens' sense of pride in themselves and in
their surroundings, Moosa said, warning that "you will never have
a sense of pride if you live in filth all around you."

LUSAKA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Fresh fighting broke out Monday noon
between Rwandese and Ugandan troops in Kisangani in the war-torn
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Zambia News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the DRC Minister of Human Rights Leonard Okitundu,
visiting Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, who was holding
consultative talks with the DRC President Laurent Kabila in
Lubumbash, immediately condemned the action and the continued
killing of innocent people.
</P>
<P>
He said it is sad that even after the April 14 meeting in the
Ugandan capital Kampala to strengthen the Lusaka peace process,
fighting has erupted again.
</P>
<P>
It is senseless for people to continue killing each other
because there would be no people to govern if the war continued,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The people of Congo want peace, the people of Congo deserve
peace, we can't say all is well until the fighting stops," he
added.
</P>
<P>
At the Kampala meeting, signatories including Rwanda and Uganda
agreed to withdraw their troops within a 15-kilometer radius.

</P>
<P>
The money was raised during the period between June 11, 1998 to

According to the committee, more than two thirds of the total
donation was raised by government departments, non-governmental
organizations, associations and individuals in the country while
the rest came from Ethiopians abroad and foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
About 42 million birr (about 5 million U.S. dollars) came from
foreign governments and Ethiopians aboard, the committee said,
adding a total of 176.1 million birr (22 million U.S. dollars) has

LUSAKA, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
Monday condemned the rebel Movement for the Liberation for Congo
(MLC) for continued violation of Lusaka cease-fire agreement
signed last year.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba made the condemnation at a press conference in
Lubumbashi, a southeastern border city of the Democratic Republic
of the Congo (DRC), after his closed-door consultations with
President of the DRC Laurent Kabila on the peace process in the
country, Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC) reported
Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, who arrived in Lubumbashi this morning for one-day
consultations, urged MLC leader Jean-Pierre Bemba to adhere to the
cease- fire agreement for smooth implementation of the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
He praised Kabila for observing the cease-fire agreement,
saying that Kabila is very ready to have dialogues with his
rivals.
</P>
<P>
He also praised Kabila's recent talks in Nairobi, Kenya, with
Rwandan President Kagame Paul, describing it as a step forward to
end the war in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba urged both the Rwandan government and rebels to stop
fighting as their skirmishes are threatening the peace process in
the DRC.
</P>
<P>
According to the Zambian president, he is concerned over the
continued violations of the agreement he mediated and there is
need to exhaust all possible ways to ensure peace in the DRC.

<P>
QUITO, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's Central Bank has up to now
destroyed 6 billion sucre bills, half of the country's circulating
currency amount.
</P>
<P>
Director of this institute's Money House Carlos Villagomez said
Monday at a press conference that since February, after the "
dollarization" adoption, half of the national currency cash has
been destroyed, especially 50,000 sucre bills which were
substituted by dollars imported from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Up to the coming September, sucres and dollars will keep
circulating in parallel, said Villagomez. He also said that the
Central Bank foresees importing 8 million dollars in currency
fractions to cover the lack of "small currency."
</P>
<P>
Ecuador decided to eliminate its currency and adopt the dollar
as exchange means, although the sucre will keep circulating for
three months more as American coin fraction.
</P>
<P>
"Dollarization" has been applied with a fixed exchange of 25,000
sucres per dollar, which has generated confusion among the
population for calculating fractions.

Investors were still in a buying mood Monday after a series of

<HEADLINE> Mexico Rejects Fear of Criticism Regarding Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Mexican Foreign Secretary
Rosario Green said Monday that facing the coming July 2 elections
in her country, Mexico's government is passing through similar
criticisms to those Peru experiences nowadays.
</P>
<P>
"Mexico is open to criticism and election observation," and
therefore there will be thousands of observers, Green said in
Windsor, Canada, where she attends the 30th General Assembly of
the Organization of American States (OAS), according to reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's diplomatic head told the press that her country is
opposed to every condemnation of or sanction on Peru and holds
that the OAS lacks power to impose punishment to any member
country of this international organization.
</P>
<P>
The OAS' observation mission considered illegitimate the
triumph of Peruvian leader Alberto Fujimori in the May 28
elections, owing to withdrawal of opposer Alejandro Toledo, and
therefore this country's election authorities are trying to
legitimize this process.
</P>
<P>
Green said, "Mexico's stance is that we don't discuss Peru's
elections (at the assembly), but rather on the principle what
interests Peruvians (have) in a cooperation program between the
OAS and their government to strengthen democratic institutions."
</P>
<P>
Mexico will hold on July 2 general elections in which millions
of Mexicans will go to the polls to elect Mexico's president, head
of government of the capital, the Chamber of Senators and
Delegates, as well as the Legislative Assembly.

<HEADLINE> Greece Demands Britain Return Back Parthenon Sculptures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Greece Monday demanded Britain
return the Parthenon Sculptures, part of the sculptures in the
famous Parthenon, Greece's national symbol, back to Greece.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou told a
committee in the British House of Commons that Greece is
determined to have the sculptures back in Athens, the Greek
capital, by the 2004 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou said the sculptures were an integral part of the
Parthenon, Greece's national symbol and a cultural artifact of
international importance.
</P>
<P>
The Parthenon Sculptures, also known in Britain as the Elgin
Marbles, were taken to London by British Lord Elgin in the 1830s,
when Greece was under Ottoman Turkish rule.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou said that this masterpiece needed to be reunified on
the Acropolis in Athens, its original location.
</P>
<P>
Calling for a "partnership approach" to the impasse over the
Marbles, Papandreou said his government was willing to consider a
wide range of options, so long as they were back in Athens in time
for the 2004 Olympic Games, which Greece is hosting.
</P>
<P>
The sculptures are currently owned by the British Museum, but
Papandreou said he did not want to get into an argument about the
events of the 1830s, when Lord Elgin acquired them for that
organization while Greece was under Ottoman Turkish rule.
</P>
<P>
Greece maintains that the Marbles were, in effect, stolen,
while Britain says they were purchased legally.
</P>
<P>
However, Papandreou told members of the Select Committee on
Culture, Media and Sport than protecting the integrity of the
monument was far more important than arguing over who owned it.
</P>
<P>
"This masterpiece must be reunified, its integrity if you like
restored, and done so within its original cultural and historical
environment in Athens," he said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing their huge significance to the Greek nation,
Papandreou said he was talking about "the greatest national symbol
of Greece."
</P>
<P>
"It symbolizes the Greek contribution to the cultural heritage
of humankind," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Let us make this a positive thing for the British Museum, a
positive thing for Britain, as well as for Greece," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Government is planning to build a museum to house the
marbles, to be completed in time for the 2004 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
While Papandreou gave evidence to the Select Committee, the
prime minister's official spokesman, Alastair Campbell, gave a
strong signal that Britain was not open to negotiation over the
future of the sculptures.
</P>
<P>
Asked if they would be handed over to Greece, Campbell replied:
"No."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the British Museum itself is keen to keep the
sculptures, arguing that they are best seen as part of a great
international collection visited by six million people each year.

</P>
<P>
With the use of barely 127 million hectares of delimited land,

sanitation, environmental protection, marketing and logistics
investing.
</P>
<P>
Pratini de Moraes said that Brazil's agribusiness exports will
reach this year 23.2 billion U.S. dollars, compared to 1999's
registered 19.9 billion, and in consequence, this sector's trade
balance surplus will go up to 16.5 billion dollars from 13.4
billion dollars last year.

<HEADLINE> Britain May Send Training Force to Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain said Monday that it would
decide this week whether to send an advance team of about 100
military advisers to train Sierra Leone government soldiers.
</P>
<P>
A Reuters report quoted a Defense Ministry spokesman as saying
the British military training advisory team is "assembling at the
moment" and ready to provide training to Sierra Leone government
forces.
</P>
<P>
If given the green light, the team is expected to provide a six-
week intensive training program, expected to work with President
Ahmad Tejan Kabbah's troops over a period of three years.
</P>
<P>
"So what we are considering is putting in a short-term training
team," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"We will decide this week whether we are going to send them and
if we do what their precise size and structure will be," he said.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman denied media reports that some British
marines already in Sierra Leone would remain behind to act as
advisers and trainers when most of British forces in the West
African state pulled out in mid-June.
</P>
<P>
The Marines replaced hundreds of British paratroopers who were
sent in May to help evacuate British citizens as fighting
intensified in the former British colony's civil war.

<HEADLINE> Russian President to Visit Moldova </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin
will pay a working visit to Chisinau in mid-June, the press
secretary of the Moldovan president, Anatol Golea, told a briefing
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Putin and Moldovan President Petru Lucinschi had a telephone
talk last week and agreed that the Russian leader would visit
Moldova on June 16 and 17 on his way back from Germany, the
Moldovan Infotag news agency cited Golea as saying.
</P>
<P>
"President Lucinschi is attaching considerable importance to
the forthcoming meeting during which the sides will discuss chief
issues of bilateral relations," said the press secretary. "Russia
is one of our main trade and economic partners, and these ties
need to be maintained and strengthened particularly in the current
economic situation when Moldovan agriculture is suffering an
unprecedented drought with unpredictable results. "
</P>
<P>
"For us, it is very important to enlist the support of the new
Russian leadership in reform conductance and cooperation
development for the good of our peoples," Golea stressed.
</P>
<P>
Petru Lucinschi and Vladimir Putin will discuss other issues
pertaining to developing cooperation within the CIS and other
international organizations, as well as political problems
presenting mutual interest.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is an active mediator in and guarantor of the final
settlement of the Transnistrian problem. The stance of Moscow
plays an essential role in the conflict solution. Naturally, this
topic will be discussed during the meeting. President Lucinschi
presumes that presently there exist realistic prerequisites for
achieving a sizable progress in settling the conflict. For this,
however, the political will of both sides is necessary, as well as
more active efforts by the international mediators in the
negotiation process -- Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE Permanent
Mission to Moldova," said the press secretary.

<HEADLINE> Gore Vows to Launch "Second American Revolution" Via Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
vowed Monday to carry out a "second American Revolution" linking
the people and their government via the Internet if he becomes
president.
</P>
<P>
Gore, in a speech at North Carolina State University, promised
that as president he would have nearly all federal services online
by 2003.
</P>
<P>
"The power of government should not be locked away in
Washington but put at your services, no further away than your
keyboard," the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate said.
</P>
<P>
Under his plan, Gore said, people could use the Internet to get
information about Social Security benefits, to apply for a home
loan, to report a crime or to find the health plan that would work
best for them.
</P>
<P>
"With your help, as president, I will lead a second American
Revolution, to make our self-government far less costly, far more
effective and far more relevant to every American," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also proposed to double the nation's investment in
information technology, which now accounts for about one-third of
the country's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Gore and Commerce Secretary William M. Daley recently released
a report showing that such spending has grown from 243 billion
dollars in 1995 to 510 billion dollars last year.

<HEADLINE> Annan Soon to Confirm Full Israeli Pullback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There remain only a few issues to be resolved, including the
identification of the practical line on the Lebanon border, said
spokesman Fred Eckhard.
</P>
<P>
U.N. experts, including cartographers and legal and military
advisers, are on the ground Monday conducting the task of
identifying the withdrawal line and are currently meeting at the
headquarters of the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) at
Naquora, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 and carved up a border strip as
a so-called "security zone" in 1985 to allegedly protect its
northern area from cross-border attacks by Lebanese Muslim
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted resolutions 425 and 426 after
the Israeli invasion, demanding immediate and unconditional
Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish state decided earlier this year to pull out from
Lebanon by July 7. However, it completed withdrawal of its troops
from south Lebanon on May 24.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has rejected its military presence in south Lebanon,
claiming that some areas along the borderline are still occupied
by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon insists that its deployment in the south will be done
only after the U.N. confirmation of full Israeli withdrawal from
Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Russia Sees Great Threat From Chemical, Biological Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Russia sees a greater emerging threat
from chemical and biological weapons using various delivery
systems rather than nuclear arms, the director of a leading Moscow
think-tank said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The director of Moscow's Center for Political Studies, Vladimir
Orlov, who attended the seminar on Russian strategic issues
organized here Monday afternoon by Limes, a geo-political strategy
magazine, said that Putin believes the main threat comes from
terrorist groups, but also "proliferator states."
</P>
<P>
The threat concerns Russia much more than the United States,
Orlov added, saying that Russia offers a "window of vulnerability"
to chemical or biological attack.
</P>
<P>
Orlov said Russia could decide to make "joint efforts" with the
U.S. on the problem, even if they have yet to reach an agreement
on it.
</P>
<P>
He also repeated that one solution could be Putin's proposal
for a local and limited anti-missile system to take care of
delivery systems that could include missiles.
</P>
<P>
"But the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty must be maintained
without any change," Orlov quoted Putin as believing.
</P>
<P>
Rybakenkov, a Russian diplomat, made the same point, telling
the seminar that the treaty has to be maintained because
deployment of anti-missile interceptors throughout the U.S. could
"destabilize" the Russian nuclear dissuasion.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want a cure that is worse than the disease," he said,
quoting Putin, also pointing that unlike the U.S., Russia has no
black list of "rogue states."
</P>
<P>
He also said that unlike Yeltsin, Putin is in full control of
Russian foreign policy, which will be "less ambiguous, more
predictable, more comprehensible and more realistic."

<HEADLINE> Portugal: Minimizing Possible Negative Effects on Women, Common Responsibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- It is the common
responsibility of the international community to minimize possible
negative effects and to empower women in their efforts to
participate in the globalization process, Portugal said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the European Union at the general debate
of the United Nations General Assembly special session on women,
Maria De Belem Roseira, minister for equality of Portugal, said
the world is now connected more closely than ever through trade,
the information revolution, communication and by the growth of a
set of shared global values.
</P>
<P>
Women have often been most profoundly affected by globalization
and systematic discrimination still prevails at many levels,
Roseira said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, along with challenges, globalization also opens
new perspectives and opportunities for positive development,
Roseira said.
</P>
<P>
"Equal rights and sharing tasks and responsibilities in all
areas of life, including decision-making, must be our focus in the
twenty-first century," Roseira said.
</P>
<P>
"It is most important to fight against specific forms of
discrimination in employment and economic life. It is also
important that an integrated approach be adopted so that our total
environment may be conducive to gender equality and to the full
enjoyment of human rights for all," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
The special session is a follow-up to the Fourth World
Conference on Women in 1995. The five-day special session, also
called Beijing+5, will focus on examples of good practices,
positive actions, lessons learned, obstacles and key challenges
remaining.
</P>
<P>
It will consider further actions and initiatives for achieving
gender equality in the new millennium.
