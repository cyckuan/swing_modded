<HEADLINE> Water Level in Wuhan Keeps Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The fourth flood crest heading for
the provincial capital of Wuhan raised the water level to 29.38
meters and the flow rate to 68,000 cubic meters a second by 8:00
pm this evening.
</P>
<P>
Water conservancy experts predict that the fourth flood crest
will reach Wuhan between August 9-11. By that time, the water
level is expected to reach 29.45 meters, only 0.28 meters lower
than the 1954 record level.
</P>
<P>
The city government issued a circular last night informing
local residents of the flood crest.
</P>
<P>
More than 150,000 civilians and soldiers remain stay on the
river dikes night and day, and a 50,000-strong emergency repair
team is on constant alert and ready to go wherever danger arises.
</P>
<P>
The city has prepared 237,000 cubic meters of stone, 122,000
cubic meters of earth, and 4.8 million plastic bags for the flood
control effort.
</P>
<P>
By today, the river embankments in Wuhan had been soaking in
water for more than 40 days, the water level had remained above
29 meters for 11 days, and danger spots had been found at over
1,000 places along the main dikes.

<HEADLINE> More Americans Do Stock Trading at Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 9 (Xinhua) -- A growing number of Americans
are doing their stock trading at home, all they use is a computer
and a modem, according to a report of the New York Post today.
</P>
<P>
A study by investment banking firm Piper Jaffrey found that
online trading accounted for 17 percent of all volume from retail
investors in 1997. In the first half of 1998, it grew to 20
percent. The Piper Jaffrey study estimates that online could
account for 30 percent of retail volume by the end of the year,
and 50 percent by the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The low cost of online trading is what first attracted
investors.
</P>
<P>
"When people move from traditional brokerage or phone execution
of trades to online execution of trades, they do increase their
trading," said Alex Goor, president of Datek Online, which allows
customers to trade up to 5,000 shares of stock for just 9.99 U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The costs are just so much lower that the investors feel they
can move in and out of stocks quickly," Goor said.
</P>
<P>
According to brokerage firms and the stock exchanges, the
average individual investor conducts two transactions each
month - typically one sell order and one buy order.
</P>
<P>
The average online brokerage customers conducts 4.5
transactions each month, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Some customers would do more trades a day.
</P>
<P>
More than 75 firms currently offering online trading, up from
fewer than 20 just one year ago. Many of these firms are taking
advantage of newly released technology to process trades of 1,000
stocks or more for less than 10 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
And many more providers of online trading are popping up every
day.
</P>
<P>
People also uses the Internet to search for information on
which they base their trading decisions. There are hundreds of
websites providing investment information.
</P>
<P>
They can also customize the site to track their favorite
stocks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it said, the Securities and Exchange Commission is
stepping up its oversight of the Internet, in hopes of stopping
stock promoters from pushing bad offerings on innocent investors.

<HEADLINE> India Asks WTO to Counter EU Dumping Duty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- India has asked the World Trade
Organization (WTO) to stop a reimposition of anti-dumping duties
by the European Union (EU) on unbleached cotton gray fabrics
imported from India, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
PTI quoted official sources as saying that WTO's director
general had asked EU officials for consultation on the issue.
</P>
<P>
India's action came in the wake of the EU move in July to make
the provisional anti-dumping duty definitive from October 10.
</P>
<P>
Last April, the EU reimposed an average 15 percent provisional
anti-dumping duty on unbleached cotton gray fabrics from India.
</P>
<P>
India's decision to move the WTO for the issue suggests that
its efforts to settle the dispute through consultations on the
bilateral basis had failed.
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time the EU imposed anti-dumping duty on
the cotton fabrics from India as well as on five other countries
including Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The first anti-dumping proceeding against these fabrics imports
was dropped in February 1996 after the complaining party,
Europcotton, withdrew its complaint.
</P>
<P>
The second proceeding was terminated in May after the EU failed
to ratify the definitive duty slapped in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
India's textile industry feels that it is being subject to
needless harassment by European weavers lobbying led by countries
like France and Italy.
</P>
<P>
If consultations with the EU fail to produce any results within
60 days, India can ask WTO's dispute settlement body to establish
a panel to examine its complaint.
</P>
<P>
The panel is expected to give its recommendations in six to
nine months once it is set up.

<HEADLINE> F.A. Intensify Drugs Checks Following Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The English Football
Association(F.A.) are intensifying its drug tests after former
Aston Villa manager Ron Atkinson claimed that drugs were used by
footballers among Premiership.
</P>
<P>
Atkinson, in his book entitled 'A Different Ball Game', said
cannabis and cocaine are taken by players and that the biggest
drugs dealer in the game is "reputed to be a well known England
international".
</P>
<P>
Atkinson says that while in charge at Villa in the early 1990s,
he subjected his players to blood tests without telling them what
they were for and that at least two players were found to have
taken an illegal substance.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday F.A. spokesman Steve Double said: "We currently have
a proposal with the government to double the existing drugs
programme.
</P>
<P>
"We are testing more but finding less. Over the last few years
the number of tests has risen to over 500 but last year there were
just three positive finds."

<HEADLINE> Mother, Son Rescued from Nairobi Bomb Blast Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- A Kenyan mother and her son were
rescued to safety Sunday from a skyscraper right next to the
building totally destroyed by Friday's car bomb in downtown
Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Neither the mother nor the son was injured, Ofer Leflea, the
spokesman for the Israeli rescue team, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers found them sitting in a room at the 19th floor of the
22-story Cooperative Bank House, which was damaged extensively
and all rooms with windows facing streets were reduced to shells
in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
"They were very afraid, very quiet, just sitting there and
shaking, although they were not hurt at all," said Leflea.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers searched all the rooms of the high-rise Sunday but no
body else was found, he said.
</P>
<P>
Leflea estimated that the rescue work will end in another 48
hours and anyone inside now has just a weak hope for survival
after two days of ordeal.
</P>
<P>
So far the rescuers, working 24 hours a day in shifts, have
already found 15 bodies and are trying to pull out a woman with
whom they have talked since Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
However, Leflea said they have failed to get her response for
about six hours and are afraid that she had already died. No
other person has been found alive.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, a middle-aged Kenyan man identified as
Gatili Nganga was pulled out of the rubble.
</P>
<P>
Now around 200 rescuers from Kenya, Israel, Britain, the
United States and France are working on the bomb debris.
</P>
<P>
A 62-member rescue team from the U.S. Office of Foreign
Disaster Assistance arrived in Nairobi earlier Sunday morning but
they are mainly working in the seriously-damaged U.S. embassy,
which was the target of the bombing.
</P>
<P>
The team's spokesman, Michael Reilly, said the fact that about
3,000 gallons of diesel is stored in the basement of the embassy
poses a great threat. The team has already started to pomp them
out.
</P>
<P>
The team has also finished a check-search in the embassy and
found neither corpses nor people alive, Reilly said outside the
embassy. So far there is still one American man missing.
</P>
<P>
The blast killed at least 155 people including 11 Americans
and injured nearly 5,000.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Rebel Leader Arrives in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 9 (Xinhua) -- John Garang, leader of Sudan's
largest rebel group, arrived in Cairo Sunday for a meeting of
Sudanese opposition.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) will meet
Tuesday with leader of Ummah Party, former Sudanese Prime Minister
Sadiq el-Mahdi and the head of the National Democratic Alliance
Mohammed Osman al-Mirghani, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leaders will discuss the outcome of the Kenya
peace talks in May, during which the Sudanese government and the
SPLA agreed on an internationally supervised vote on
self-determination for the restive south.
</P>
<P>
The SPLA, which draws support from the south's Christian and
animist peoples, has been fighting since 1983 for greater autonomy
for the south from the Islamic north.
</P>
<P>
The fighting and consequent famines have claimed more than 1.5
million lives.
</P>
<P>
The latest peace talks between Khartoum and the SPLA in the
Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa ended in failure Friday due to their
differences over the boundaries of southern Sudan, the
relationship between religion and state, and the arrangement
before a referendum on self-determination.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting in Cairo was suggested by Egypt, which
fears that the civil war in southern and eastern Sudan can lead to
a division of the country that will affect the control of the Nile
River, the overwhelming source of Egypt's water.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa will also meet Garang next
week to discuss the ongoing efforts to end Sudan's 15-year civil
war.

<HEADLINE> Museveni Appoints New Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni appointed 15 new ministers and absorbed some former
ministers into the cabinet at the State House Sunday, a press
release said.
</P>
<P>
According to the press release issued by the President's
Office, deputy parliament speaker Betty Okwir becomes a cabinet
minister in the Office of the Vice President.
</P>
<P>
She was joined by six other cabinet ministers in the Office of
the President, one cabinet minister of the Office of the Prime
Minister and 14 ministers of state.
</P>
<P>
The function was attended by Ugandan senior officials and
relatives of the appointees.
</P>
<P>
Originally, Museveni submitted a list of ministerial nominees
for parliament approval which includes his younger brother, Salim
Saleh, who is currently the "overseer" in the Ministry of
Defense.
</P>
<P>
This nomination sparked off strong opposition from the House.
Some MPs disqualified him for not having obtained an A level
certificate, a prerequisite for a ministerial post.
</P>
<P>
To save Museveni from allegations of practising nepotism,
Salim withdrew himself from the list even after he was convinced
that the course he is attending in Jinja, some 80 kms east of
Kampala, is an equivalent of A level.
</P>
<P>
According to Uganda's constitution enacted in 1995, any
ministerial post must be filled by a nominee who has at least an
A level certificate.
</P>
<P>
Though a veteran in the army, Salim is reported to have
dropped out of school at Senior Two, at least two years away from
A level education.

<HEADLINE> Israel Urges Russia to Stop Help Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu Sunday urged Russia to make more efforts in
curbing its missile technology from transferring to Iran.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the call in his meeting with visiting Andrei
Kokoshin, national security adviser of Russian President Boris
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Iran was advancing in developing ballistic missiles, which
poses a "direct threat to Israel's security," the prime minister
said.
</P>
<P>
Russia must act 10 times harder to prevent Russian companies
from providing arms technology to Iran, Netanyahu made the remarks
in a speech to reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Iran test-fired the Shahab-3 missile, which with
its range of 1,300 kilometers is capable of hitting Israel and the
U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Israel has accused Russia of providing weapons technology that
Iran has used to develop missiles.
</P>
<P>
Russia has denied helping the Iranian missile project, and
Iranian officials also rejected claims that Russian helped build
Shahab-3.
</P>
<P>
Kokoshin, once again denying the charges of inaction in stemming
technology flow to Iran, said he hoped the discussion with
Netanyahu will lead to better understanding on the matter, which
he said was "a real important matter for the national security of
Russia as well."
</P>
<P>
Kokoshin's visit preceded next month's summit between Yeltsin
and U.S. President Bill Clinton in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia sees Israel as the key to ensure that a
U.S. threat of sanctions against Russian companies allegedly
transferring missile technology to Iran is not there at the time
of the summit.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Goes Off as Water Tanker Engine Bonnet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 9 (Xinhua) -- A Tanzanian security guard
said Sunday that a bomb hidden in the engine of a water tanker
belonging to the United States Embassy went off Friday when a
guard was opening the engine bonnet.
</P>
<P>
Nzema Adamn, a supervisor of the Ultimate Security Group which
together with the U.S. marines are responsible for the security
of the U.S. embassy, said the seven-ton Toyota water tanker was
under normal security check at the entrance to the embassy
premises at about 10:50 a.m. local time (07:50GMT) when an alarm
suddenly sounded from the detector.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old Elisha John, one of the Ultimate guards, went
to open the bonnet to check for "dangerous material", the bomb
inside went off, killing him instantly and the tanker driver,
identified by just one name of Ndange, as well as other four
guards including a female.
</P>
<P>
Adamn said it is not clear if the bomb was remote controlled,
time controlled or touched off.
</P>
<P>
The bombing has claimed 10 lives as of Sunday evening and
injured more than 70 in the most violent attack which has ever
happened in Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> UK FM Denounces Ex-MI5 Man's Claims on Libyan Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said on Sunday that claims of the plans of the Secret
Intelligence Service (SIS) to kill the Libyan leader, Colonel
Muammar Gaddafi, were "pure fantasy".
</P>
<P>
He told the BBC'television: "I have pursued these allegations
and I am absolutely satisfied that the previous Foreign Secretary
did not authorize any such assassination attempt."
</P>
<P>
"I am also satisfied that SIS never put forward any proposals
for such an attempt. Nor have I seen anything that would suggest
that SIS had any interest or role of any such escapade," he added.
</P>
<P>
Former MI5 officer David Shayler, currently under arrest in
Paris, has spoken about an alleged plot by SIS to kill Colonel
Gaddafi in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Shayler said an officer of the intelligence service MI6 told
him of such a plot. The assassination failed after explosives were
placed under a wrong car.
</P>
<P>
Cook also said he saw "no basis" for an inquiry following a
report in the The Observer newspaper that senior Labor
backbenchers think one may be necessary.
</P>
<P>
"There was no government-inspired plan to assassinate Gaddafi,"
the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
However, Shayler's girlfriend Annie Machon insisted Shayler had
good sources. She said: "He headed up the Libyan section in MI5
for over two years so he was very well informed about all matters
relating to Libya.
</P>
<P>
Cook added that he was determined that the claims should not
jeopardize moves to bring to trial two Libyan men accused of the
Lockerbie airline bombing, which killed nearly 300 people in 1988.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Shelling Wounds Lebanese Civilian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 9 (Xinhua) -- One Lebanese civilian was wounded
on Sunday during an Israeli shelling on south Lebanon, the
National Broadcast Network radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The 76-year-old Mohammd Halili Malra was wounded when the
Israeli artillery's mortar rounds hit the village of Majdal Zoun
facing the western sector of the Israeli occupied zone in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
A number of houses and cars in nearby village of Mansuri were
damaged during another Israeli shelling, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli bombardment came shortly after its positions in
the zone were attacked by Lebanese anti-Israeli guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Shiite militia Amal headed by Parliament Speaker Nabih
Berri later claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, 14 Lebanese civilians were killed and 71

Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer self-styled security

its northern settlements from cross-border attacks by Lebanese
guerrillas.

Since then, Lebanese resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting

<HEADLINE> U.S. Marines, Explosive Experts Pour in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 9 (Xinhua) -- About 100 marines of the
United States and some 80 agents of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation as well as explosive experts arrived here Sunday in
three groups to probe the blast at the U.S. embassy Friday.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Tanzanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and
International Cooperation said the marines flew in from a NATO
(North Atlantic Treaty Organization) base in Belgium at about
04:00 p.m. local time (01:00gmt).
</P>
<P>
They have blocked all the roads leading to the U.S. Embassy
with barbed wires, set up sand bag blindages with machine-guns
and begun to monitor at the top of the main building in the
Embassy compound.
</P>
<P>
The official, who asked not to be named, said the FBI agents
and explosive experts came directly from the U.S. mainland in two
groups.
</P>
<P>
However, they were carefully checked at the sentry posts by
the marines when they came to the U.S. Embassy from the airport
in a row of lorries filled with heavy boxes.

<HEADLINE> 174 Confirmed Dead in Nairobi Bomb Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Nation Disaster Center
announced Sunday night that the official death toll from Friday's
bomb blast has risen to 174.
</P>
<P>
However, it didn't give the latest figure for those injured.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers have found 27 bodies from the debris since
Saturday, eight of them were found Sunday, the center said.
</P>
<P>
A Kenyan woman and her son were rescued to safety on Sunday
from a skyscraper right next to the building completely destroyed
by Friday's car bomb in downtown Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Neither the mother nor the son was injured, Ofer Leflea, the
spokesman for the Israeli rescue team, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers found them sitting in a room at the 19th floor of the
22-story Cooperative Bank House, which was damaged extensively
and all rooms with windows facing streets were reduced to shells
in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, a middle-aged Kenyan man was pulled out of
the rubble alive. Up to now, the three are the only survivors
found in the bombing site.
</P>
<P>
Now around 200 rescuers from Kenya, Israel, Britain, the
United States and France are working on the bomb debris
round-the-clock in shifts.
</P>
<P>
At noon on Sunday, the office of President Daniel arap Moi
said the number of the injured stood at 4,824. Of them, 25 are
in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
Of the injured, around 540 are still receiving treatment in
hospitals and 4,257 were discharged after treatment at various
hospitals, according to the presidential office.
</P>
<P>
Among the dead are six female and five male Americans, U.S.
embassy spokesman Bill Barr told Xinhua. One American man is
still missing.
</P>
<P>
Moi toured the bomb site in downtown Nairobi Sunday morning,
mourning for thousands of victims and condemning the cool-blooded
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Looking sad and shaken, Moi said the bombing was "astonishing
and very terrible" and he himself definitely does not believe the
raid would help anyone's cause.
</P>
<P>
"How can they expect us to support their cause if they use
such methods?... Even if they wanted the U.S. embassy, they
should not have targeted Kenya," Moi said in a sad tone.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he announced that the Kenyan police are now
pursuing several clues on the blast but withheld details.
</P>
<P>
U.S. embassy spokesman Bill Barr told Xinhua Sunday that the
U.S. administration will cooperate with Kenya in probing the bomb
blast which was supposed to target the U.S. embassy.
</P>
<P>
"We (the two countries) will be very cooperative," said Barr.
The bombing killed 11 Americans and injured another 15. A
memorial service for the killed Americans was held in a private
place here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of experts from the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) are arriving in Nairobi to probe the
explosion.
</P>
<P>
A 62-member rescue team from the U.S. Office of Foreign
Disaster Assistance arrived in Nairobi earlier Sunday morning but
they are mainly working in the seriously-damaged U.S. embassy,
which was the target of the bombing.
</P>
<P>
The team's spokesman, Michael Reilly, said the fact that about
3,000 gallons of diesel is stored in the basement of the embassy
poses a great threat. The team has already started to pump them
out.
</P>
<P>
Following the bombing, the Kenyan government has taken
measures to boost security in all diplomatic areas, airports,
ports and other entrances of the east African country.
</P>
<P>
The government has also allocated 50 million Shillings (some
850,000 U.S. Dollars) as an emergency fund for the tragedy.

<HEADLINE> Youth Conf Calls for Sustainable Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Participants of the 3rd
Global Youth Conference for the End of Hunger Sunday urged world
leaders to give priority to sustainable human development efforts
in their countries.
</P>
<P>
The call was contained in a resolution adopted at the end of
the three-day meeting held here in the Ethiopian capital.
</P>
<P>
The resolution appealed to the United Nations to set up a
United Nations Fund for Youth.
</P>
<P>
What's extremely worrying is that currently, about 2.9 billion
people still do not have access to sanitary facilities, while 140
million children do not attend school, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
What's more, one out of three children in Africa are below
average weight and much of the progress made is threatened by
HIV/AIDS, which could be a primary factor in regression, and
children and women are victims of war, terrorism and weak
economic policies, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the closing ceremony, Samuel Nyambi, resident
representative of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP)
in Ethiopia, said despite significant economic growth and living
standards over the past decades, about 1.3 billion people still
live on less than one U.S. Dollar a day.
</P>
<P>
According to him, ending hunger will be achieved when the
cause of poverty is tackled ultimately when countries achieve
certain level of human-centered development and equitable
distribution of resources which is vital for developing a
sustainable human development.
</P>
<P>
Gana Digne, representative of Food and Agricultural
Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in Ethiopia, said FAO is
highly committed to finding ways to eliminate hunger and poverty
which are still the major problems in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
I.I. Ekanem, an official from the United Nations Economic
Commission for Africa (ECA), said ECA is planning to sensitize
policy makers of its member countries to the urgency of achieving
poverty reduction by integrating population, food security and
environmental concerns in their national development plans.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by Youth Ending Hunger members from
12 countries including Ethiopia, Uganda, Benin, Ghana, Burkina
Faso, Malawi, Senegal, Japan, Bangladesh and Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Expert Calls for African Air Safety Coop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- An expert from Nigeria's Ministry
of Aviation has called on aviation authorities in Africa to
develop a comprehensive project on airworthiness and the safety
of aircraft on the continent.
</P>
<P>
The project would assist participating states to improve on
their oversight systems while strengthening cooperation among
states, said K.K.O. Sagoe, a director of the ministry.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, "perhaps most important, for the long term, is
the project participants' goal of establishing uniform,
harmonized high level of safety standards and procedures," Sagoe
said at a workshop held here over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
It is especially so as "airworthiness, flight operations and
licensing experts have been identified, and each major subject
has been adopted by a lead country," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the establishment of a multinational
regional institution for operational safety oversight could also
be used as a resource by countries within the African region.
</P>
<P>
Member states could form a multinational technical
"inspectorate" whose expert resources could be drawn upon by
various civil aviation activities in the region according to
their individual needs, Sagoe said.
</P>
<P>
"They would relieve individual civil aviation administrators
of the need to build, in every state in the region, a fully
competent staff of difficult-to-recruit technical specialists
who, in most cases, would not be needed on full time basis," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The multinational inspectorate can be established as a
government body, an international government cooperative or a
private organization, the director added.
</P>
<P>
According to him, similar projects have been developed in the
United States and Latin America.

<HEADLINE> UNSCOM Suspends New Arms Inspection in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 9 (Xinhua)-- The U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) in charge of scrapping Iraq's weapons of mass destruction
has suspended arms inspections of new sites in Baghdad as Iraq has
announced suspension of cooperation with it, a U.N. official said
today.
</P>
<P>
"Inspection in respect of the commission's disarmament
responsibility are temporarily suspended," Sullivan, special
assistant to the director of the U.N. Baghdad Monitoring and
Verification Center, told reporters, according to reports reaching
here from the Iraqi capital.
</P>
<P>
"In light of the present situation and pending further
instructions, inspections are being conducted of the sites in Iraq
which are subjet to monitoring," she said.
</P>
<P>
But Sullivan said that UNSCOM's experts would continue to
monitor sites either already identified by the Commission or
declared by Iraq itself, looking for evidence of prohibited
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said last Wednesday that it would freeze its cooperation
until the Commission was "reformed" or its headquarters moved
from New York to Geneva or Vienna to reduce America's influence.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has been complaining that the Commission is pro-America
and attempting to prolong the arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council could not consider lifting of the
eight-year U.N. sanction against Iraq if the Commission does not
declare that the country is free of prohibited weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
But the Commission has been under growing pressure to make the
certification for the lifting of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Members of the U.S. Wilderness Group which is campaigning
against the continuation of the sanctions today held
demonstrations in front of the U.N. Headquarters in New York.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 9 (Xinhua) - Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa denounced the car bomb attack on the United States
Embassy here as "evil, inhuman and despicable" following a brief
inspection of the scene Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said that the perpetrators of the bombing were not
wishing well the cordial relations between the U.S. and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"The enemy of the U.S. is the enemy of Tanzania," said an
angry Mkapa, who was accompanied by the U.S. Charge d'Affaires
John Lange. "Tanzania will cooperate with the U.S. to bring those
terrorists to justice."
</P>
<P>
Claiming Tanzania puts the safety of the foreign missions on
its high agenda, the President pledged sterner measures to be
taken to prevent them from any possible terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
Later, Mkapa inspected the adjacent embassies of Nigeria and
France which also suffered damages and injuries during the Friday
car bomb explosion at the entrance of the U.S. embassy premises.
</P>
<P>
He also visited the well-equipped Muhimbili Medical Center
where 63 Tanzanians, all civilians, have been admitted following
the bombing and 10 of them have died as of Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen others were admitted to the private run Aga Khan
Hospital and most of them have been discharged after being
treated.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Minister Submits Resignation Over Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Water and Irrigation
Minister Munther Haddadin submitted his resignation Sunday
following accusation that he is to blame for the recent polluted
water scandal in Amman.
</P>
<P>
"The situation engulfing my service has become difficult and I
do not want it to negatively affect the accomplishments of the
Ministry of Water and Irrigation," Haddadin said in his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
Haddadin's resignation came two days after King Hussein
criticized the government for "being lax in carrying out its
duties and responsibilities," the official Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
Residents of western Amman complained earlier this week that
water flowing out of taps has had an odor and contains worms and
larvae for three weeks.
</P>
<P>
And so far, scores of people have been hospitalized for
diarrhea and nausea-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
Hussein, who is undergoing treatment for cancer in the United
States, summoned Prime Minister Abdul-Salam Majali Monday and
ordered an investigation of the water contamination.
</P>
<P>
Haddadin has attributed the contamination to the negligence of
officials in a water treatment plant, which supplies drinking
water to the capital.
</P>
<P>
But the Agricultural and Water Committee under the Lower House
of Parliament, which was established to supervise the government's
work in agriculture and water, asserted the pollution was caused
by the extra quantity of algae in Lake Tiberias and the Yarmouk
River, which are two major water sources for Amman.
</P>
<P>
The water scandal has shaken the already weak government, which
was blamed for a mounting recession in the resource-barren country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Agricultural and Water Committee
demanded the resignation and trial of Haddadin and other officials
for their roles in "causing the problem."
</P>
<P>
A coalition of the opposition parties, including the powerful
Islamic Action Front, has even called on the whole cabinet to
resign.
</P>
<P>
Majali has not responded to Haddadin's resignation. But he said
on Friday that "If it was proven a person is responsible, even the
prime minister himself, he should be punished."
</P>
<P>
But Majali ruled out the possibility of the whole cabinet's
resignation, adding that any option in this regard would be made
by the king.
</P>
<P>
A special commission has been established to investigate the
water scandal.

<HEADLINE> Disconnection Threatens Nigeria's lnternet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Internet operators in Nigeria have
recently come into a painful choice: either to give up part of
their profits to the national telephone firm NITEL or withdraw
from the business.
</P>
<P>
The trouble started two months ago when the Nigerian
Telecommunications Ltd. (NITEL) informed the operators that they
will have to pay monthly 10,000 Naira (about 120 U.S. Dollars)
for each receiving line they have subscribed for their internet
services.
</P>
<P>
NITEL's demand is based on the fact that the over 800
telephones lines acquired individually by internet operators
under originating and receiving calls agreement have been
converted into dedicated lines, contrary to the terms of
agreement in their application letters.
</P>
<P>
NITEL management, therefore, insisted that "by simply
dedicating those lines as receiver only, there is already a
violation of our agreement because our exchanges are configured
to make and receive calls and not permanently on receiver only."
</P>
<P>
lnternet operators, however, challenged that elsewhere in the
world, internet service providers are even given some discounts
by telephone companies as incentives for hooking on to their
system.
</P>
<P>
This formed the basis of petition to the head of state against
NITEL, one operator said.
</P>
<P>
NITEL management, however, argued that it is not discouraging
internet development in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
According to Tayo Ekundayo, the deputy general manager for
Public Relations of NITEL, internet operators charge 80,000 Naira
(about 940 Dollars) annually on its customers in addition to
usage charges, while they only pay NITEL 105 Naira (about 1.2
Dollars) per month for each line.
</P>
<P>
What NITEL asks from the internet operators "who hijacked so
many digital telephone lines" is only 10,000 Naira to help
maintain the lines and exchanges, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the allegation that NITEL rakes in a substantial revenue
from internet users, he said there are corporate bodies like
hotels, banks and oil companies who pay as much as two million
Naira (about 24,000 Dollars) a month per telephone line.
</P>
<P>
He further said some internet operators have already complied
with NITEL's directive, so there is no reason why others should
decline.
</P>
<P>
Toyin Ogunseinde, the marketing manger of Ross Claytom, one of
the signatories to the series of petitions against NITEL,
however, said the Nigeria Internet Group, an umbrella body for
the operators, is only responsible to the Nigerian Communications
Commission (NCC).
</P>
<P>
If NCC is alive to its duties, it should call NITEL to order,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We did not obtain our licenses to operate internet services
from NITEL, so we know that there will soon be a compromise one
way or the other," he added.

<HEADLINE> Failure Rate of British Students on Sharp Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The failure rate in British
universities has gone up from 12 percent three years ago to a
record high of 19 percent, according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
That means one in five or a total of about 60,000
undergraduates dropped out of courses or failed their finals
across the country last year, although many resumed studying
later.
</P>
<P>
Such a rate costs British taxpayers an estimated 360 million
pounds ( over 570 million U.S.dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
The National Union of Students attributed the rising failure
levels to money worries among students and fears of large debts,
which could be exacerbated by the introduction of tuition fees of
1,000 pounds a year, according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
But some educationalists blamed the rapid expansion of higher
education. The Sunday Telegraph quoted Nick Seaton, chairman of
the Campaign for Real Education, as saying: "A lot of people are
now going to college who would be better off going straight into
jobs, and that's why they end up dropping out. It would save a lot
of heartache and taxpayers' money if youngsters were vetted much
more carefully before they went. Increasing university places has
been a mistake."
</P>
<P>
The authorities had promised an extra 35,000 university places
by the year 2000, in the belief that the expansion is necessary to
create a highly skilled workforce.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier research, almost half of academic staff
thought the quality of undergraduate entrants to their departments
had declined over the past five years in a rapid shift to "mass
higher education".
</P>
<P>
The marketing strategies adopted by universities are considered
another reason for the wastage. Schools published prospectuses
with the "characteristics of travel brochures", which many
students assimilated uncritically, according to observers.
</P>
<P>
Educationalists had urged universities to do more in explaining
the virtues of "not rushing into higher education without a sense
of commitment".

<HEADLINE> 8 Kenyans Feared Trapped in Bombing Rubble  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Eight staff of the Cooperative
Bank of Kenya are feared to be still trapped in the building
neighbor, the U.S. embassy.
</P>
<P>
The eight, whose names were not released, were on duty at the
bank's Merchant Cooperative branch when the car bomb blew up,
local sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Nation Disaster Center announced Sunday night that
the official death toll from Friday's bomb blast has risen to
174. The number of the injured is approaching 5,000.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers have found 27 bodies from the debris since
Saturday, eight of them were retrieved Sunday, the center said.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the bank's managing director E.K. Mureithi told
Xinhua when touring the bombing site that as many as 14 workers
in his bank were missing.
</P>
<P>
He said if it had not been due to the continuous bankers'
strike over tax on their low-interest staff loans, his bank would
have lost far more staff, customers, as well as cash and
property.
</P>
<P>
Mureithi told Xinhua that he was at his office in the
Cooperative Bank House right next to the collapsed building when
the bomb exploded. His first reaction was to run out of the
skyscraper without any idea of what had happened.
</P>
<P>
"I'm lucky, I was not hurt," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mureithi also said that the bank, the fourth largest in Kenya,
only "lost very little money."
</P>
<P>
"We were operating on very little cash on that day. As a
matter of fact, we had sent for more money from the Central Bank
but it hadn't arrived. We intercepted it and it was returned to
CBK's vaults," he said.
</P>
<P>
Early on Sunday, Kenyan security officials barred the bank's
team from entering the head office in the extensively-damaged
22-story Cooperative Bank House to retrieve computers and other
office equipment.
</P>
<P>
The area has been sealed off since Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Now around 200 rescuers from Kenya, Israel, Britain, the
United States and France are working on the bomb debris round the
clock. So far only three survivors -- one man, one woman and her
son -- have been found.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Bankers' Strike Still on: Union  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Bankers' strike is still on
Sunday in Kenya although Friday's bomb blast has claimed about
largest bank, the Cooperative Bank of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Jacob Opiyo, the chairman of the All-Banks Shopstewards
Committee, said Sunday that the strike which started last Monday
is not suspended as no meeting to endorse such a decision has
been convened.
</P>
<P>
"In regard to the on-going bankers' strike, we wish to state
that our strike action on the issue of taxation on our loans is
still on," Opiyo said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he called on all members of the union to attend a

<HEADLINE> Flood Situation Further Improves in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The overall flood situation in
Bangladesh continued to improve on Monday, with a slight fall of
water levels in all the major rivers of the country, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The number of flood-related deaths was 275 as of Monday,
officials from the Disaster Management and Relief Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Three diarrhea-caused deaths were registered during the last 24
hours, bringing the total death toll from diarrhea to 38, health
officials said.
</P>
<P>
So far some 58,900 people have been affected by diarrhea and
3,473 medical teams are working around the clock in the 37
flood-hit districts to check any possible outbreak of water-borne
diseases, they said.
</P>
<P>
The situation has improved in almost all the affected
districts, except the southeastern Chandpur district, where an
onrush of upstream waters has made the situation there slightly
deteriorate, officials from the Flood Forecasting and Warning
Center said.
</P>
<P>
The situation has returned to normal in 14 districts and is
improving in 22 districts, but may remain unchanged across the
country during the next 24 hours, they said.

<HEADLINE> Annan Recommends 1-Month Extension for U.N. Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, reporting no improvement in the already deplorable
situation in Angola, Monday recommended a one-month extension for
the United Nations Mission of Observer in Angola.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Security Council of the United Nations, the
secretary-general warned that the risk of full-scale hostilities
has significantly increased. He urged the government of Angola and
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) to
refrain from any steps which would further exacerbate the
situation.
</P>
<P>
Annan called on the government, particularly UNITA, to review
their efforts toward national reconciliation, to cease the
exchange of threats and war rhetoric, and to immediately initiate
confidence-building measures.
</P>
<P>
"I am most disturbed by the failure of UNITA to demobilize
fully its forces and to facilitate the extension of state
administration throughout the country," the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that despite past declarations to the contrary, UNITA
has evidently maintained a significant military capability. On
many occasions, UNITA's residual troops had been identified as
being responsible for attacks on villages and towns as well as
ambushes in major roads.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general emphasized that genuine dialogue would
only be possible when the high-level UNITA representatives
returned to Luanda and participated constructively in the Joint
Commission.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-genearl's report reaffirmed the willingness of
the United Nations to continue helping the Angolan people,
providing there was an unequivocal commitment to a peaceful
resolution of the crisis, based on the 1994 Lusaka Protocol.

<HEADLINE> - Kiriyenko Asks for German Loan Guarantee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko has sent a message to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
asking for the early granting of a government guarantee for a
credit to be extended by German banks to Russia, the Itar-Tass
news agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
In his message, Kiriyenko said an agreement was initialed in
1997 on the extension to a rolling mill at the Magnitogorsk
Metallurgy Works (Magnitka), in the Southern Urals. It provided
for a loan worth 965 million German marks (530 million U.S.
dollars) by a consortium headed by Dresden Bank. All loans of
that kind are insured by Hermes.
</P>
<P>
The government press service said a consortium of German banks
was expected to allocate a loan to Russia for the construction of
Magnitka.
</P>
<P>
The Russian prime minister assured Chancellor Kohl that Moscow
was ready to take all necessary measures to meet "the appropriate
commitments resulting from the agreements signed."
</P>
<P>
Magnitka, which is one of the Russia's three leading
metallurgy plants, accounts for 17.5 percent of the domestic
rolled products, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Over the first half of 1998, it had an 11 percent rise in the
production of ferrous metals over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Its average profit rate rose to 10.5 percent in 1998, from 7.8
percent in 1997 and 7.6 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Magnitka annually exports about 3.8 million tons of its metal
production, of which 43 percent goes tor South-East Asia and
Japan, 22 percent to the Middle East and Africa, 20 percent to
America and 15 percent to Europe.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Officials Evacuated From Central Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Monday
airlifted nine Iranian nationals including one diplomat from the
central Afghan province of Bamiyan, fearing that a Taliban assault
on the province is imminent.
</P>
<P>
The Iranians were evacuated to Islamabad Monday evening in a
special U.N. plane. Bamiyan Province is controlled by pro-Iranian
Shiite Hizb-e-Wahdat, which is one of the parties in the
anti-Taliban Northern Alliance.
</P>
<P>
The Iranians were received at the airport by officials from
Pakistan's Foreign Ministry. However, no Iranian talked to the
press despite repeated requests by some Islamabad-based
journalists.
</P>
<P>
Two Iranian officials had no documents and the immigration
officers at the airport had to prepare their documents on an
emergency basis.
</P>
<P>
There was some confusion as to whether the Iranian officials
are members of the Iranian consulate or some of them are employees
of the Iranian Consulate General in Mazar-i-Sharif, the major
strategic northern Afghan town which fell under the Taliban's
control last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday afternoon, a Foreign Ministry spokesman told the
media that Pakistan is making all endeavors to secure safe passage
for Iranian officials stranded in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He said that in response to an Iranian request, the Pakistani
government is "trying its best" to secure the release of the
Iranian officials.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian officials had been stranded in Mazar-i-Sharif, the
headquarters of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance, as a result of
fighting between the Taliban and their opponents.
</P>
<P>
Following the fall of Mazar-i-Sharif to the Taliban, Iran asked
Pakistan on Sunday to arrange a safe passage for its diplomats.

<HEADLINE> Survey: UK Public Hostility Towards EMU Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain's long-standing hostility
towards the European Monetary Union (EMU) is on the wane with the
latest opinion poll showing an increase of approval rate.
</P>
<P>
The new survey published by MORI and Salomon Smith Barney,
revealed that the percentage of those against British membership
in the single currency, due to be formally launched in 1999, is
now at its lowest since 1991.
</P>
<P>
The latest poll showed that 33 percent of people questioned
were in favor of Britain joining the EMU, an improvement from 30
percent in March and 27 percent in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
Those against EMU membership were put at 50 percent, down from
54 percent in March and last October and the undecided camp stood
at 17 percent, little changed compared with prior periods.
</P>
<P>
The MORI report said, "Public opinion is still too hostile to
allow an early EMU referendum, but this swing in sentiment raises
the chance that the government will be able to fulfill its aim of
EMU entry in 2001-03."
</P>
<P>
The report said that greater business support and the Labor
government's favorable stance towards euro could be regarded as
obvious reasons for this improvement in public sentiment.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Urges Developing Nations to Boost Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas Monday called on developing countries to increase
solidarity and cooperation to meet the challenges of
globalization.
</P>
<P>
Opening the Group of 77 High-Level Advisory Meeting on South
Summit here, Alatas said developing countries continue to be
marginalized as a result of globalization because most of them do
not have strong bargaining power.
</P>
<P>
In view of this, the G-77 has a vital role to play as a
coordinator and unifying forum.
</P>
<P>
The G-77, established on June 15, 1964, by 77 developing
countries, now has 132 members from Africa, Asia, Latin America,
the Caribbean Sea and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Around 40 experts from various developing countries gathered
here Monday for a two-day meeting to discuss measures to increase
South-South cooperation and preparations for a planned South-South
summit.
</P>
<P>
About the forthcoming G-77 summit meeting, Alatas said it is to
be held as part of a planned summit of all developing countries in
the world.
</P>
<P>
"We are making preparations to realize what has been decided as
one of the Group of 77's plans, namely holding a summit among all
developing countries plus the People's Republic of China," he told
reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
There has never been such a summit meeting before and it would
the largest in history, he said, adding that Indonesia as the head
of the group for 1998 has taken responsibility to hold two
preparatory meetings.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia plans to organize a ministerial-level meeting
in September to confirm the agenda, time and venue of the summit.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan in a written address read by
the Executive Secretary of the U.N. Economic and Social Commission
for Asia and the Pacific Region Adrianus Mooy said the current
economic crisis should become an important experience for the
world, particularly for the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The crisis proved that a regional economic phenomenon could
have international repercussions, Annan said in the address.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that studies be conducted regarding globalization
and all its phenomena such as free market, capital and trade flows
so that developing countries could learn from the studies.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Former world champion British
driver Colin McRae will begin race for the Ford team next year, it
was confirmed on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 world rally winner, who drives in Subaru this season,
is currently second in this year's drivers' championship behind
Toyota's Carlos Sainz of Spain. The Briton has collected 13
titles in international events with Subaru since joining the team
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
McRae will lead the Ford team's challenge, alongside Finn Juha
Kankkunen, as they develop the Focus car next season.
</P>
<P>
"The move to Ford provides me with a unique and fresh
challenge," the 30-year-old driver said. "I will play a major
role in the development of a new World Rally Car.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, Ford's total commitment to winning the world
championship means that my own ambitions do not have to be put on
hold while the new car is developed."
</P>
<P>
Subaru's technical director David Lapworth said McRae's
departure is a disappointment to the team but that he remains
confident that the momentum of this season, which has seen McRae
take three wins so far, will see them triumph in this year's world
championship battle.

<HEADLINE> S. African Gold Mines Double Earnings in 2nd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The depreciation of the South
African currency and lower production costs helped South Africa's gold
mines more than double their earnings in the second quarter of the
year, The Citizen newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Earnings in the quarter increased by 113 percent to 552.3 million
Rand (87.7 million U.S. dollars) from 258.9 million Rand (41.1 million
dollars) in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The sliding Rand pushed the gold Rand prices up. The currency lost
some 25 cents since late May.
</P>
<P>
The average gold price received increased by three percent to 1,732
Rand per ounce in the second quarter from 1,681 Rand per ounce in the
first quarter, while costs fell by one percent from 1,334 Rand per
ounce to 1,316 Rand per ounce.
</P>
<P>
Other profit was a negative 180.3 million Rand (28.6 million
dollars) mainly due to retrenchment costs, the paper quoted Fedam
analyst Nick Goodwin as saying.
</P>
<P>
Goodwin said most gold companies had completed the biggest part of
their restructuring and retrenchment costs would decline substantially
in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Because the low Rand should have a bigger impact, the average gold
price received should increase further to around 1,930 Rand per ounce
and total earnings of the gold mines are expected to double again to
some 1.1 billion Rand (174.6 million dollars) in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
The industry suffered a loss of 156.8 million Rand in the second
quarter last year and showed profits of 100.6 million Rand and 110.7
million rand respectively in the last two quarters of last year.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate of the Rand against the dollar was below five
last year.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Pledges to Assist Laos in Nation Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Monday pledged to assist Laos in its
nation-building efforts.
</P>
<P>
"In the spirit of ASEAN and South-South cooperation, Malaysia
is ever willing to share our development experience and technical
know-how to assist Laos in its nation-building efforts," he said
at a dinner he hosted in honor of visiting Laotian Prime Minister
Sisavath Keobounphan here Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The Laotian prime minister arrived here earlier Monday for a
three-day official visit to Malaysia, the first to Malaysia as the
prime minister of the Lao People's Democratic Republic.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir, who visited Laos in 1994, said Sisavath's trip bore
testimony to the mutual desire of the two governments to further
strengthen relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir expressed the confidence that the coming years would
see ties between Malaysia and Laos becoming more substantive
especially in trade and economic cooperation with Laos being a
fellow member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN), of which Malaysia is a founding member.
</P>
<P>
He said the deepening bilateral relations between Malaysia and
Laos are evident by the fact that the two countries had signed a
number of agreements including the Bilateral Investment Guarantee
Agreement, Air Services Agreement, Economic, Scientific and
Technical Cooperation Agreement and Bilateral Payments Arrangement
and a Memorandum of Understanding on Energy Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said the signing of the Bilateral Trade Agreement and the
Tourism Cooperation Agreement Tuesday would provide an additional
impetus to uplift the bilateral economic and trade relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the bilateral relationship is on the right course,
Mahathir said he was convinced that there is ample scope for
expansion given the enormous potentials and items available for
trading purposes in both countries.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Malaysia is pleased to observe that since its
admission into ASEAN in July 1997, Laos has participated
enthusiastically in ASEAN activities and made constructive
proposals for enhancing intra-ASEAN cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir also said Malaysia and Laos share almost identical
views on many international issues of common concern and have
sought to make constructive contributions through their
participation in many international organizations including the
United Nations and the Non-Aligned Movement.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir and his Laotian counterpart are to meet Tuesday to
discuss and exchange views on various bilateral, regional and
international issues and identify new areas where the two
countries can cooperate to enhance their relationship in the years
ahead.

<HEADLINE> Three in 10 Americans Poor Periodically: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Three in 10 Americans lived
below the poverty line for at least two months during a three-year
period, but few remained poor for longer stretches, the Census
Bureau reports.
</P>
<P>
A new study released on Monday examined poverty in the United
States between 1993 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
During the period, 30.3 percent of the population lived below
the poverty line for at least two months. But only 5.3 percent of
them stayed poor for two full years.
</P>
<P>
"These statistics portray poverty as a trap door for a few and
a revolving door for many," said the report, which analyzed data
from those three years.
</P>
<P>
The government considers a three-person family poor if its
annual income is below 13,650 dollars. For a four-person family,
it is 16,450 dollars.
</P>
<P>
But the rates differ dramatically by race and family structures.
</P>
<P>
Blacks, Hispanics and children are among the poorest groups in
the nation.
</P>
<P>
Single-mother families are the the most likely to be poor. In
1994, nearly half of the female-headed households lived in poverty
for at least two consecutive months, more than three times the
poverty rate of married couples.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Members of Lesotho's ruling
party, Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD), Monday erected roadblocks
in two of Maseru's access roads, South African Press Association
reported.
</P>
<P>
The roadblocks were set up near Lekhaloaneng and the road leading
to and from the airport.
</P>
<P>
LCD members reportedly searched vehicles coming into town for fear
that they might be carrying weapons destined for the opposition
parties. Some non-LCD members were allegedly assaulted during the
searches.
</P>
<P>
The Local hospital has admitted at least four people and one was
reported to have died, allegedly as a result of the beating.
</P>
<P>
Two women were shot and wounded allegedly by LCD members Monday
morning in the Maseru suburb of Motimtoso.
</P>

Spokeswoman for opposition parties, Monica Mopedi said Moletsane
Monayake, who was to present statistics to South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki and Lesotho Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili
proving that the May general elections were rigged in favor of the
LCD, was put under house arrest, 30 minutes before the meeting started
at noon.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki flew to Lesotho Monday morning to try to ease political
tension there at the request of the leader of the Marematlou Freedom
Party, one of the three major opposition parties in Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
The situation was relatively calm in the capital Monday afternoon

<HEADLINE> HK Shipping Committee Meeting to Boost Shipping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Shipping Committee of Hong
Kong held its first meeting here Monday to discuss how to further
promote the region as an international shipping center.
</P>
<P>
Chaired by an experienced Hong Kong ship owner Frank Tsao, the
committee under the Hong Kong Port and Maritime Board is set up to
advise the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region on supporting the Hong Kong shipping industry.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the committee agreed to undertake a
detailed study to review the development of the Hong Kong shipping
industry, identify its potential and formulate a comprehensive
strategy to build up Hong Kong's position as an international
shipping center for the region.
</P>
<P>
It also agreed to look into, as a matter of priority, actions
to further increase the competitiveness of the Hong Kong shipping
industry, including shipping taxation, manpower training,
international promotion and research and information gathering.
</P>
<P>
Tsao said after the meeting that Hong Kong has long been a
center of shipping business in Asia and Hong Kong ship owners
control some 6 percent of the merchant ships in the world, ranking
fifth after Greece, Japan, Norway and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"To build on this strength and promote the synergy between our
very successful port and equally successful shipping industry, the
Shipping Committee's top priority is to promote to the
international shipping community the excellent support services
provided by Hong Kong such as ship management, ship finance,
arbitration and insurance, and to attract the international
shipping companies to set up operations in Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
This will help support Hong Kong's economy and provide more
employment opportunities to Hong Kong people, he added.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,200 vessels with a gross tonnage of 31 million tons
are owned or managed in Hong Kong by more than 70 companies.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1990, the autonomous Hong Kong shipping Register
now has some 480 ships of more than 6 million gross tons flying
the flag.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Sends Medical Aid to Kenya, Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Monday sent three tonnes
of medical equipment and medicine to Kenya to help treat the
victims of the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has also decided to provide the same medical aid to
Tanzania to help treat the victims of another bombing of the
U.S. Embassy in the Tanzanian capital of Dar es Salaam, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
A three-ton batch of medical equipment was shipped at dawn
Monday to Kenya and the same amount will be shipped to Tanzania on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The medical aid was extended as part of Egypt's brotherly
relationship with both Kenya and Tanzania, said the MENA.
</P>
<P>
Up to 200 people were killed and about 4,000 other injured in
the twin explosions taking place minutes apart at the American
embassy buildings in both capitals last Friday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. medical, forensic and disaster relief experts continued to
arrive at the blast sites Monday to help the East African nations
cope with the tragedy. They are joined by rescue teams from
Israel, India, Japan and several other countries.
</P>
<P>
No one has so far claimed responsibility for the bombings as
U.S. intelligency authorities are trying desperately to locate
those who are responsible.
</P>
<P>
The suspicions were directed at Middle Eastern terrorists who
have made threats against the U.S. recently.
</P>
<P>
But a senior aide to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said
Sunday that it would be "dangerous" to accuse any party of
involvement in the explosions at the present stage.
</P>
<P>
He called on all sides concerned to wait for the outcome of the
ongoing investigations.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Launch Major Attack on Opponents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
have launched another attack against the opposition Northern
Alliance after taking the strategic northern Afghan city of
Mazar-i-Sharif last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the Associated Press of Pakistan, the
Taliban forces said they have now broken through the lines of the
Northern Alliance about 20 kilometers north of the capital, Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a Taliban commander on the frontline north of
Kabul as saying the second offensive against the Northern Alliance
began on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban commander said his forces had advanced about 10
kilometers north toward the disused airbase at Bagram. The Taliban
captured a number of opposition positions and some military
equipment, he added.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted eyewitnesses as saying they saw a large
number of bodies of Northern Alliance fighters in the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
The report said that this seems to be yet another significant
military gain for the Taliban militia who have pushed the
opposition back from the frontline just 25 kilometers north of the
capital, thus relieving pressure on the capital city.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban are reported to have captured the major strategic
town of Mazar-i-Sharif in northern Afghanistan in their attack
early last Saturday. The Taliban are now in control of the city's
airport and main government buildings.

<HEADLINE> Less New Firms Established in Macao in First 6 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The number of new companies
established in the first half of 1998 declined 33.6 percent from
the same period last year, the latest statistics here show.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Macao Census and Statistics Department
on Monday show that a total of 251 new companies were founded
between January and June this year, with registered capital added
up to 82 million patacas (about 10.25 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
While the number of new companies dropped, the registered
capital rose 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter of the year, a total of 122 new firms
were established, with a registered capital of 68.30 million
patacas (about 8.54 million U.S. dollars). Most of the new firms
are specialized in wholesale and retailing business, hotels and
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
The decline of the number of new firms was believed to be the
result of a continuous slowdown in economic growth. The economic
growth rate for 1997 was officially announced at minus 0.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a total of 14 companies were disbanded between April
and June, with a registered capital of 1.5 million patacas (about

<HEADLINE> Annan Urged to Pay Attention to Seat Allocation in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's two opposition
leaders send a letter to Kofi Annan Monday to call him to pay
urgent attention to the critical question of the seat allocation
formula to be used in the 1998 Cambodian election of Members of
the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The quarrel about seat allocation formula has been intensified
over recent days. Prince Ranariddh, President of Funcinpec, and
Sam Rainsy of Sam Rainsy party (SRP) claimed the National Election
Committee (NEC) illegally changed the formula and vowed to boycott
the new National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The letter said: "Although this may appear to be a technical
matter, there is a great danger that the will of the Cambodian
people will not be carried out if the NEC is permitted to
improperly change the formula for allocating seats in the
Assembly."
</P>
<P>
According to the opposition parties, the new formula gives
Cambodian People's Party (CPP), led by Second Prime Minister Hun
Sen, 64 seats, a majority in parliament, instead of 59 seats under
the old formula.
</P>
<P>
"Now we put our faith in the United Nations to do what is in
its power to help prevent a procedural manipulation that would
distort the will of the Cambodian people and have far-reaching
consequences," the letter signed by Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy said.
</P>
<P>
NEC has, meanwhile, issued a clarification on the legal formula
for seat allocation which explained that no change had been made
to the formula before the polling day.
</P>
<P>
"The formula was never changed. The only thing changed was the
example in the draft, because there were some mistakes. NEC
reviewed the draft and changed it," a legal adviser to NEC said.
</P>
<P>
The two opposition leaders also threatened that "no coalition
government can be formed until the legal formula for seat
allocation is implemented and the irregularities pointed out by
the opposition are properly addressed, because we have to ensure
that the will of the people is fully respected."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Secretary General Friday expressed his satisfaction
with Cambodia's election held on July 26 and urged all political
parties to resolve their differences through dialogue to form a
new government which would reflect people's will of reconciliation
and development.

JOHANNESBURG, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The situation in Lesotho's
capital, Maseru, remained tense Monday morning following the
shooting of two women, allegedly by members of the ruling Lesotho
Congress for Democracy (LCD), South African Press Association
(SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted opposition parties spokeswoman Monica Mopedi as
saying the two were shot and wounded Monday morning in the Maseru

"They do not want people from opposition parties there.
Apparently these two women were walking in the street wearing
T-shirts bearing opposition party slogans," Mopedi said.
</P>
<P>
"They shot them. These people do not even allow our supporters
staying in Motimtoso to get out of their houses."
</P>
<P>
LCD supporters were also allegedly throwing stones at passing
vehicles.

<P>
Mopedi also revealed that Moletsane Monayake, who was to

</P>
<P>
"His house is surrounded by police and the army. They even
refused his lawyer access to him.
</P>

"We are going to take this up with Mbeki and Mosisili. There
is no way we can continue negotiating when one member of our team
is under house arrest." said Mopedi.
</P>
<P>
Following a request from a leader of one of the opposition
parties, the Marematlou Freedom Party, Mbeki flew to Lesotho
Monday morning to try to bring the warring parties around the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Mopedi said Maseru was a "ghost town". No one had been to work
and people were instead protesting in the streets.
</P>
<P>
About 10,000 opposition party members had converged on the
gates of King Letsie III's palace since last Tuesday, rejecting
last May's elections.
</P>
<P>
They gathered at the entrance to the palace, making camp fires
and singing anti-government songs over loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrations turned violent Wednesday and police had to
fire rubber bullet and use water cannons to disperse protesters
in front of the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Mosisili, who was addressing the National Assembly on
Lesotho's political situation, was trapped until the crowd were
dispersed.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Jordan Stress Unity in Confronting Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi said Monday that Iran and Jordan will unite as one in
confronting Israel despite their differences over certain issues.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi made the remarks at the Tehran airport to see off his
visiting Jordanian counterpart Jawad Anani, the official news
agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
"Naturally we have some difference of opinion on certain
issues, but we stressed the fact that given their common enemy,
all regional countries should get united," Kharrazi said.
</P>
<P>
But he did not elaborate what the differences are.
</P>
<P>
Terming his talks with Anani "frank and sincere", Kharrazi said
Anani's visit has laid good basis for expansion of bilateral ties,
</P>
<P>
"We have stressed in our negotiations that disputes between
the two countries left from the past should be removed," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the two countries should focus on the expansion
of bilateral political, economic and cultural cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Anani, who arrived here Saturday, told reporters at the airport
that his talks with Iranian officials were fruitful, and the two
countries have decided to remove the obstacles hindering the
development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
For that end, he added, the two sides agreed to increase
exchange of visits by officials.
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic ties between Jordan and Iran were severed during
the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war due to Jordan'a support for Iraq, but
they were resumed in 1991.
</P>
<P>
But the bilateral ties have been strained since 1994 when the
two sides asked each other to trim its diplomatic mission in their
capitals.
</P>
<P>
The May 1997 election of moderate President Mohammad Khatami
brought warmer ties between Iran and Arab states, including Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Iran still disagree about the Mideat peace
process. Jordan has signed a peace treaty with Israel, which is
regarded by Iran as a leading enemy in the region.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Rejects EU Curbs on Potato Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Egypt rejected Monday the
restrictions set by the European Union (EU) on Egyptian potato
exports next season, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The EU has demanded that the imported Egyptian potatoes come
only from plantations pronounced clear from a brown plant disease
under the inspection of a joint committee.
</P>
<P>
It has also called for a total ban on the import of potatoes
from Egypt if the moldy ones among the exported potatoes exceeds a
certain percentage.
</P>
<P>
Saad Nassar, Ministry of Agriculture representative in the
Egyptian-European partnership talks, said that Egyptian Ambassador
to the EU Raouf Saad, has sent a letter to the EU rejecting the
European restrictions.
</P>
<P>
The letter charged the EU move for running contrary to the
spirit of the European-Egyptian partnership agreement which has
been negotiated for months and is expected to be signed shortly.
</P>
<P>
The letter added that Egypt considers the restrictions as
"trade hurdles," considering that it has been importing potato
plant seeds from some EU countries and that the European consumers
were satisfied with the quality, price and taste of the Egyptian
potatoes.
</P>
<P>
It said that Egypt has so far this year exported 270,000 tonnes
of potatoes to Europe.
</P>
<P>
Nassar returned from Brussels Sunday night after five days of
talks between Egypt and the EU to clinch a partnership pact, which
has been delayed by EU's threat to restrict Egypt's agricultural
exports and impose anti-dumping duties on Egyptian cotton.
</P>
<P>
France, Spain, Portugal, Austria, Italy and Greece have backed
20 percent duties on imports of unbleached cotton fabrics from
Egypt as an anti-dumping measure, which was met by Egypt's threat
to cut trade.
</P>
<P>
The EU is expected to issue a final verdict in September on
whether or not anti-dumping fees will be imposed on Egypt's cotton
exports.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's annual imports from the EU averages 5 billion
U.S. dollars, while exports stand at about 1.7 billion dollars, of
which oil products alone account for more than 41 percent.

<HEADLINE> China's Exports Continue to Grow in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Customs statistics show
that China's import and export volume totaled 179.49 billion
U.S. dollars in the first seven months this year, up 4.2 percent
from the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
Exports rose 6.9 percent to 103.1 billion U.S. dollars, while
imports went up 0.7 percent to 76.39 billion.
</P>
<P>
July was the first time since January 1993 that China's
overall import and export volume declined, but this does not mean
China brought in or sold less during the month.
</P>
<P>
Actually, according to the latest custom statistics, export
volume grew 3.5 percent over the year-ago period to reach 16.16
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
China's import volume in July, 11.96 billion U.S. dollars, was
higher than any other month this year, although it went down 6.4
percent from the figure of July last year. However, the decline
was due to the extraordinarily high basic figure in July 1997,
which was about 13 percent more than the ordinary one.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the situation for exports is still
favorable. Export volume stopped decreasing in June and continued
to rise in July. May was an orphan month, with a decline in
exports in that month for the last two years.
</P>
<P>
The favorable climate is attributed to a series of positive
initiatives adopted by China in credit, drawback, and the
administration of exports, and expansion of export capability
of domestic enterprises, which has abundant supply and lower
prices.
</P>
<P>
China's trade surplus reached 26.71 billion U.S. dollars by the
end of July, adding 30 percent, or 6.1 billion U.S. dollars to the
1997 figure. Experts say this will be significant for increasing
foreign exchange reserves and holding the yuan RMB stable.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges U.N. to Help Release Iranian Diplomats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi on Monday called for a overall effort by and immediate
assistance of the United Nations to secure the release of Iranian
diplomats captured by the Afghan Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, Kharrazi
said the Taliban militia, contrary to international regulations
and principles, broke into the Iranian consulate general in
Mazar-e-Sharif on Saturday after shooting at its gate.
</P>
<P>
After indecent behavior towards Iranian diplomats, the Taliban
forces confined the Iranians at the basement and then transferred
them to other places, the official news agency IRNA quoted the
letter as saying,
</P>
<P>
Iran said earlier that the safety of the Iranian mission and
its diplomats rests with the Pakistani government, who is believed
to support the Taliban, the letter said.
</P>
<P>
Eleven Iranian diplomats and a correspondent were taken into
custody by the Taliban forces, who swept into Mazar-e-Sharif, a
stronghold of the rival Northern Alliance led by President
Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Now the Taliban forces claimed they have not arrested the
Iranian diplomats and have no information about their whereabouts,
Kharrazi said.
</P>
<P>
IRNA reported earlier that sources inside Afghanistan informed
Iran that the Taliban militia transferred the captured Iranian
diplomats and correspondent Sunday night to Qandahar, the group's
headquarters in southern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the Iranian diplomats and correspondent
were in good health and high spirits when arriving in Qandahar.
</P>
<P>
Iran has lodged strong protest to the Taliban action and urged
the Pakistani government to take measures to secure the release of
the Iranians as soon as possible.

The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- American intelligence officers and law-enforcement personnel
from around the world streamed into Nairobi to search for clues in
the bombing that killed at least 190 people and injured nearly
5,000 there.
</P>
<P>
-- U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan summoned his special envoy
in Baghdad for talks this weekend and sent him back with a message
asking President Saddam Hussein to end Iraq's refusal to cooperate
with arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>

-- The vehicle that apparently contained the bomb that exploded
at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi Friday morning was driven first to
the main entrance of the compound, but guards refused to let it
pass and sent it to the rear of the build, an embassy official
said Sunday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hot Late Summer Batters Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Longhua Meteorological
Observatory of Shanghai today recorded the highest temperature of
the year, 38.7 degrees centigrade, as local residents are
experiencing the hottest summer in half a century.
</P>
<P>
Since August 8, Shanghai has been suffering from a heat wave
with temperatures exceeding 38 degrees centigrade for three days.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Shanghai Central Meteorological Station
attribute the successive hot days to subtropical high pressure in
the western Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Because the cold air from the north is weak, and the tropical
storm from the south Pacific does not affect the Yangtze River
Delta, the subtropical high pressure maintains strong and stable,
said experts, adding that south and southwesterly winds from inland
areas have exacerbated the high temperatures.
</P>
<P>
There has been no rain in Shanghai so far this August, and the
high temperatures are expected to continue because of the dearth
of strong cold air from the north, according to experts.

reaches of the Yangtze River have caused water levels between
Yichang and Shashi in central China to rebound, according to
latest official reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The water level at Shashi City was 44.67 meters at 5:00
pm today, the same level recorded in 1954, when a devastating
deluge killed over 33,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The water level at Yichang City jumped from 52.96 meters to
53.24 meters within four hours between 1:00 pm and 5:00 pm today.
</P>
<P>
The water level at Shashi reached the dangerous high of 44.95
meters on Saturday morning, and it then began to recede with the
passing of the year's fourth flood crest and breaches of secondary
dikes in the area. The water level at Shashi stood at 44.63 meters
this morning.
</P>
<P>
However, water levels began to rebound as rainstorms pounded
the upstream Chongqing Municipality from yesterday afternoon to
this morning, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
Preparations for a major diversion program at the Jingjiang
Flood Diversion Zone in central China's Hubei Province are in the
final stage. It is designed to save large downstream cities along
the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
All the local residents in the zone, including Gong'an County,
which could be affected by the discharged flood waters, have
reportedly been moved to shelters or their relatives' homes.
</P>
<P>
To minimize losses for the local people, the State Flood
Control and Drought Relief Headquarters has reduced the number of
people to be relocated to 110,000, far less than the previous
figure of 330,000. The zone has a total population of 513,000.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that local officials are making final
inspections in the villages and towns left vacant by the
relocations to see if there is anything that needs to be salvaged.
</P>
<P>
Local residents in the diversion zone, with an average yearly
income of 1,000 yuan, are mainly farmers. Few industries have been
built there.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji visited the zone twice this year, on July 6
and August 8-9, and has placed top priority on the lives of the
people, saying that no diversion program will be carried out
without the relocation of all the affected residents.
</P>
<P>
The government is still pondering the diversion plan in the
Jingjiang zone, and has decided the program will be carried out
only when the water level at Shashi reaches 45 meters, and is
rising.
</P>
<P>
In the proposed major diversion action, part of the Yangtze's
embankments in Gong'an would be dynamited and the North Flood Gate
would be opened to discharge flood waters.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Reports Progress in Dialogue on East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The recent dialogue between
Indonesia and Portugal under the aegis of the U.N. secretary
general, has shown progress toward achieving a solution to the
East Timor issue, the Indonesian foreign minister said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said that during the dialogue
Portugal agreed to study Indonesia's proposal to grant East Timor
special autonomy.
</P>
<P>
During the August 4-5 dialogue in New York, Alatas said,
Portugal also agreed to the establishment of interest sections in
friendly embassies in each other's capitals by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said however that there are still unresolved problems
which he hopes could be thrashed out during the next dialogue to
be held in December.
</P>
<P>
One problem is whether Portugal will accept Indonesia's
proposal as the final solution to the East Timor question or
whether it will ask for more conditions before accepting the
proposal, he said.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, became a province of
Indonesia in 1976. The U.N. General Assembly in a resolution
adopted in 1977 rejected the claim that East Timor has been
integrated into Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Under the Indonesian proposal, East Timor would enjoy autonomy,
which allows it full governance except in the fields of foreign
affairs, external defense and some monetary policies.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said he hopes that Portugal would be convinced that
autonomy is a realistic, pragmatic and peaceful solution to the
East Timor issue.
</P>
<P>
A referendum will only spark civil war in East Timor, he added.

<HEADLINE> Combination Therapy to Cure AIDS: Professor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Combination therapy is becoming
popular against AIDS in the world because it helps overcome the
resistance produced by a single medicine, an AIDS expert told
Xinhua here Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
John Rwomushana, a coordinator with Uganda AIDS Commission,
said the AZT (Zidovudine), the first anti-AIDS drug which began
to be used 10 years ago, can produce resistance once it is used
on human body for more than one year.
</P>
<P>
To overcome the resistance, AIDS experts turn to combination
therapies such as double, triple and quadruple therapies. AZT
plus 3TC can be very effective, he said.
</P>
<P>
The method is now quite popular in the United States and most
of Europe. He said some 60 to 70 percent of AIDS patients in the
United States saved their lives by using this therapy.
</P>
<P>
To check the spread of the killer disease, the Ugandan
government has tried to enhance people's awareness and launched a
multi-sectoral approach.
</P>
<P>
The AIDS experts also offer counseling and conduct blood
safety screening. Now the Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy
(HAART) and Drug Access Initiative have been launched.
</P>
<P>
The government is also trying to develop low-cost vaccines for
those suffering from AIDS and HIV virus. Meanwhile, people are
advised to change their behavior in order to wipe out the disease
completely from the country.
</P>
<P>
The first case of AIDS was reported in Uganda in 1982 and now
an estimated 1.5 million people are infected and the number is
still increasing.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, the government began to sensitizing people on the
hazards of the HIV virus and two years later a law in this field
was enacted and an AIDS Control Program set up in the Ministry of
Health.
</P>
<P>
Ugandans are now still too poor to afford expensive anti-AIDS
drugs. Therefore it still has a long way to go before the bulk of
AIDS patients have access to the drugs.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus will take measures to
tackle the severe warter shortage on this drought-hit eastern
Mediterranean island, a government statement said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued by the Minister of Agriculture, Natural
Resources and Environment Costas Themistocleous said the Cypriot
cabinet agreed last week to seek tenders for building two mobile
desalination plants due to be put into operation before next
summer.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has one desalination plant in Dhekelia on the eastern
coast, and the second is expected to be completed early next
century.
</P>
<P>
The minister warned that water supplies could run out by the
end of the year due to the extended drought.
</P>
<P>
He promised that the government would do everything possible to
solve this problem.
</P>
<P>
"We will also investigate the possibility of importing water
from abroad as an alternative," Themistocleous said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will study the feasibility of
introducing higher charges on water as a step to promote water
saving.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has also planned to encourage people to use water-saving
devices and systems for recycling "grey water" for use in toilets
and garden irrigation, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government will also provide financial support
to repair water pipe networks in towns and villages, he added.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Infection Kills More Ugandan Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Majority of children infected
with HIV virus or AIDS die within five years, with very few
exceptions, an AIDS professor has said.
</P>
<P>
Professor John Rwomushana, a coordinator for health sector with
Uganda AIDS Commission, told Xinhua Monday morning that only some
30,000 infected children can receive various treatments.
</P>
<P>
He said that previously, some 30 percent of children born to HIV
positive mothers are infected and now the rate has dropped to 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
He described three main means of mothers transmitting AIDS virus
to children: breastfeeding (14 percent), direct transmission (10
percent) and during delivery (5-6 percent).
</P>
<P>
Now the AIDS commission is focusing its attention on an
anti-retroviral treatment to children who are directly infected with
AIDS virus from their mothers' wombs.
</P>
<P>
Once given the treatment, some 60 percent of the directly
infected children can be saved from the killer disease, he added.
</P>
<P>
In Uganda, the infant mortality rate of babies born to HIV
positive mothers is 163 per 1,000 live births while that for babies
born to non-HIV positive mothers is 34 per 1,000 live births.
</P>
<P>
Many of the children born to HIV positive parents become orphans
easily and they are usually discarded by other members of the big
family because they are considered as a burden. Therefore, many of
them suffer discrimination and are very likely to become street
children.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Over 100 generals of the Chinese
People's Liberation Army (PLA) are alongside more than 100,000
officers and men to brace the embankments against the ravaging
floods along the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
As the fourth flood crest rushed downstream, the Jinan,
Guangzhou and Nanjing military area commands, the air force and
armed police sent a 30,000-strong contingent to dangerous sections
of the Yangtze River dike, bringing the total number of PLA men on
the dike to more than 100,000.
</P>
<P>
The Central Military Commission has earmarked an additional 10
million yuan as subsidies to improve the life of officers and
men on the embankments, treat illnesses and prevent epidemics.
</P>
<P>
The general armament department has equipped the flood-fighting
troops with 1,000 motor vehicles, 1,000 boats, 15,000 life
preservers, 50 radios and 120,000 spades and carts.
</P>
<P>
The General Logistics Department has dispatched 66 emergency
trains from six cities to flood-ravaged areas.
</P>
<P>
Over 7,000 men of the Jinan Military Areas Command, led by army
commander Ding Shouyue, have worked six days and nights on the
southern embankments of Jingjiang River, repairing 83 dangerous
areas since they set off from Shandong and Henan Provinces.
</P>
<P>
Airborne troops have positioned 8,000 people on the
250-kilometer-long northern embankment of the Jingjiang River.
</P>
<P>
Transport planes are shuttling between PLA stations and key
sections of the Yangtze River embankments, shipping soldiers and
relief materials day and night.
</P>
<P>
Sources from PLA headquarters say that all PLA troops are ready
to be sent wherever they are needed to ensure the safety of the

<HEADLINE> Captured Iranian Diplomats Transferred by Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Monday said the Afghan
Taliban militia has transferred captured Iranian diplomats and a
correspondent to Qandahar, the group's headquarters in southern
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Sources inside Afghanistan informed Iran of the whereabouts of
these people, who were taken in custody Saturday when the Talian
forces took over Mazar-e-Sharif, a stronghold of the rival
Northern Alliance.
</P>
<P>
The Iranians were in good health and high spirits when
arriving in Qandahar, the official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
Before moving them to Qandahar, the Taliban transferred them
from Mazar-e-Sharif to the Shindand base, near Herat, southwestern
Afghanistan, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban took 11 Iranian diplomats and an IRNA correspondent
captives. Iran has been accused of supporting the Northern
Alliance in fighting against the Pakistan-backed student militia.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban seized the capital Kabul in 1996, and has won
control over most the country and imposed a strict version of
Islamic rule there.
</P>
<P>
Iran has lodged a strong protest against the Taliban action and
urged the Pakistani government to make effort to secure the
release of the Iranians as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> DNA Study Shows NZ Maoris Come From Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The ancestors of Maoris, the
native people in New Zealand, and the other Polynesian peoples,
were migrants from Taiwan, according to research conducted with
new techniques for analyzing human DNA.
</P>
<P>
The people who eventually became the Maoris originated in
mainland Asia and, starting from Taiwan, island-hopped their way
through the Philippines and Indonesia to West Polynesia and
ultimately on to the islands of East Polynesia and then New
Zealand, Wellington's Victoria University scientist Geoffrey
Chambers said in a research report published Monday by the
university.
</P>
<P>
"There is an exact living record of these voyages of
colonization, preserved in the DNA of their modern-day descendants
who are still living in these places along the route," a
Wellington-based newspaper quoted Chambers as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Evening Post also quoted Chambers as saying forensic DNA
profiles carried out at Victoria University had also found that
Polynesians in general and New Zealand Maoris in particular showed
less genetic diversity than many other ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
The overall probability of finding two individuals with a
specific DNA profile was found to be one in 112 million for
Asians, one in 47 million for Caucasians, one in 6.7 million for
Polynesians and one in 2.8 million for Maoris.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Election Commission Prepared to Conduct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Election Commission of
Malaysia is prepared to conduct a snap election if the Prime
Minister decides to dissolve Parliament earlier, its Chairman
Harun Din said Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, the Election Commission required between four and five
months to verify and display the new electoral rolls, he told
reporters in Alor Setar, capital of the northern state of Kedah,
after a briefing to election officials, according to official
media reports.
</P>
<P>
The commission is verifying the names of about 500,000 new
voters who had registered under the recent 42-day voter
registration exercise nation-wide, he said, hoping the commission
could display the old and new electoral rolls in about a months'
time for the public to raise objections or appeal.
</P>
<P>
According to the Election Commission chairman, there are 9.3
million electorates in Malaysia excluding new voters.
</P>
<P>
Kedah is the fourth state to hold briefings for election
officials by the commission which already held similar briefings
in Kelantan, Sabah and Terengganu.
</P>
<P>
Harun said the briefings were held not because the General
Election was imminent but were part of the commission's job to
keep the officials abreast with the election procedures.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's last general election was held in 1995 and the next
one is due in 2000. However, there are indications recently that a
snap election would be held before the schedule as parties are
preparing for the polls, and according to reliable sources the
general election will be conducted most possibly in November this
year or early next year.

by the city government. Since 1988, the city government has had a
policy, the only one in the country, of making individuals apply
for a license plate through public bidding. Its purpose was to
restrict the number of private cars, but it also kept local people
from buying a family car.
</P>
<P>
But, in June, the city eased restrictions with a quota system
for the public bidding and came up with preferential policies to
stimulate the private car market.
</P>
<P>
Local car dealers say that the private car business is likely
to do better if prices and fees are lower and more flexible ways
of payment are introduced.

<HEADLINE> International Genetics Congress Opens In Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Some 2,000 scientists gathered
in Beijing today for the 18th International Congress of Genetics,
whose theme is "Genetics -- Better Life for All".
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Li Lanqing spoke at the opening ceremony of the
six-day conference, where scientists and scholars from 54
countries and regions will discuss how to use genetics to increase
grain output, cure diseases, and protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
Tan Jiazhen, a prominent Chinese geneticist and chairman of the
congress, says that agriculture should be developed through
genetics to solve the food problem, which is getting worse because
of population growth, water shortages, and desertification.
</P>
<P>
A genetic relation to many diseases, aging and even death has
been found, Tan pointed out, so scientists should try to develop
new therapies and medicines based on genetics, and with their
cooperation, the new century will hopefully see rapid progress
in treating diseases like cancer and in prolonging human life.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining an ecological balance and preventing deterioration
of the environment is another responsibility of geneticists and of
mankind as a whole, he said.
</P>
<P>
This is Beijing's first international genetics congress, which
has been held every five years for nearly a century. The 18th
congress is sponsored by the International Genetics Federation,
the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Chinese Genetics Society.

<HEADLINE> Foreigners Accused of Inciting Unrest in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yangon, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The 18 foreigners, detained by
the Myanmar authorities on Sunday for allegedly attempting to
incite unrest in the capital of Yangon, were supported by a
foreign organization, a Myanmar official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant-Colonel Hla Min, general staff officer of the Office
of Strategic Studies of the Myanmar Defense Ministry, told a press
 conference here Monday afternoon that the foreigners' trip was
arranged and financed by an anti-Myanmar government organization.
The organization is called Alternative ASEAN Network of Burma, an
umbrella body of various groups supporting the opposing movements
from neighboring Asian countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreigners, who arrived here last Friday, distributed
leaflets in downtown Yangon on Sunday, voicing support for the
Myanmar people in their struggle for human rights and democracy.
</P>
<P>
Among the foreigners caught are 10 males and eight females,
including six Americans, three Thais, three Malaysians, three
Indonesians, two Filipinos and one Australian.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the country's politics, the official also said,
"The overwhelming majority of the people in Myanmar as natural as
are elsewhere in the third world countries are not obsessed with
politics."
</P>
<P>
"At this stage of Myanmar's development, they care more for the
 basic rights such as security and safety of their lives and
properties, a decent job which will help put enough food on the
table for their families and also a decent place for them to
live," he added.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Sign Convention on Nuclear Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has decided to sign the
Convention on Nuclear Safety, which marks an important step in its
effort to seek nuclear security assurances from Turkey, its
hostile northern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
An official press release issued on Monday said the Cypriot
Cabinet made the decision at a meeting last Friday and is expected
to submit a relevant bill to the House of Representatives for
approval.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has reportedly planned to build two nuclear reactors in
the earthquake-prone area of Akkuyu on its southern Mediterranean
coast, about 185 kilometers north of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot parliament has voiced grave concern over Turkey's
plan, quoting results of independent studies as saying the
proposed venue is close to the Akkuyu fault, an active seismic
zone, which makes the selection of this particular area an
extremely dangerous and risky option.
</P>
<P>
The 1994 Convention on Nuclear Safety, of which Turkey is a
signatory, calls for realization and maintenance of worldwide
nuclear safety.
</P>
<P>
It demands the signatories provide all necessary information
about the nuclear facilities to their neighbors for them to assess
their safety.
</P>
<P>
Signing the convention "is especially important for Cyprus due
to Turkey's intentions to construct a nuclear (power) plant in the
seismic area of Akkuyu," the press release said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed
troops and took over the northern third of the island after a
pro-Athens coup by the Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is maintaining 35,000 troops to allegedly protect the
Turkish Cypriot ethnic minorities, who unilaterally declared in
1983 the breakaway "Turkish republic" in the north, recognized
only by Ankara, against the internationally acknowledged Republic
of Cyprus dominated by the Greek Cypriots.

MACAO, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Macao businessmen have made
donations of 1.48 million patacas (185,000 U.S. dollars) to aid
victims of a severe flood in the Yangtze River area in China's
mainland.
</P>
<P>
The donation was made by members of the Macao Chamber of
Commerce, and was handed over on Sunday to the Xinhua News Agency
Macao Branch. Xinhua will transfer the money to the flood victims.

A Macao Daily News editorial on Monday urged Macao residents
to make more donations for the victims.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several years, Macao residents often made such
donations to victims of natural disasters, like earthquake and
flood.

announced a donation of a million patacas (125,000 U.S. dollars)
for the victims in the Yangtze River area.

<P>
MAPUTO, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano revealed that a draft plan for the reform of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) has been made.
</P>
<P>
A committee composed of Chissano and his Namibian and Malawian
counterparts Sam Nujoma and Bakiki Muluzi has made concrete
suggestions to solve the crisis now facing SADC, Chissano made
the announcement Sunday at a press conference held jointly with
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
The committee will submit a report on the issue to other heads
of state and government in the region at a time they deemed
proper, the Noticias newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
On the possibility of direct intervention with the Democratic
Republic of Congo by a SADC joint army, Mugabe said "We have never
discussed the issue."
</P>
<P>
Before the press conference, Chissano and Mugabe held a
meeting and co-presided over the commemoration of the dead in
the Tembwe slaughter.
</P>
<P>
Twenty one years ago, about one thousand Zimbabweans and
Mozambicans were killed in Tembwe, near the capital city of
Manica Province in Mozambique, by the former Rhodesia (now
named Zimbabwe) regime.
</P>
<P>
Chissano returned to Maputo Sunday night after his four-day
visit in Manica Province bordering with Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Warns Against Rash Accusations over Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has warned against rash
accusations that Arabs might involve in the twin bombings
targeting American embassies in Africa, the Egyptian Middle East
News Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
There is not enough and clear information about the bombings
and it is "dangerous to accuse" any party of involving in the
explosions, Egyptian Presidential Advisor Osama Al-Baz said during
a meeting Sunday with young campers in the Mediterranean port city
of Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
Al-Baz called on all sides concerned to wait for the outcome of
investigations.
</P>
<P>
Two powerful bombings took place last Friday, apparently with
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania as their target. More than
140 people have been killed and over 1,000 others injured in the
atrocities.
</P>
<P>
Followers of Osama Bin Laden, a Saudi-born billionaire who has
sworn to wage a holy war against the U.S., were alleged to have
masterminded the terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
Reports also said that a new and unknown Islamic group has
claimed responsibility for the bombings. But the claim could not
be independently confirmed.
</P>
<P>
"Any country which gets hold of any information about the two
incidents should declare them immediately," Al-Baz said.
</P>
<P>
He voiced Egypt's regret over the killing of innocent people
and condemned all acts of terrorism, and called for international
cooperation in fighting terrorism.

Chinese scholars say the paintings, with their rough lines, are
typical of the Yuan style. They were found in six brick tombs with
passes leading to burial rooms and carvings to remind people of a
traditional Chinese house.
</P>
<P>
They say that the find will help the study of the architecture

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Traces Source of Rumors of Disturbances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said Monday that
it has been tracing the source of last Friday's rumors of
disturbances in the federal capital of Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Home Minister Tajol Rosli Ghazali said the Internal
Security Act (ISA), which provides for detention without trial for
two years, would be invoked on those responsible.
</P>
<P>
Police are now enlisting the cooperation of the Malaysian
Institute of Microelectronics Systems to verify the origin of last
Friday's rumors before taking the next course of action against
the culprits, he told reporters after attending the official
welcome ceremony here for Laotian Prime Minister Sisavath
Keobounphan.
</P>
<P>
Declining to give details, the deputy home minister said the
authorities regarded such rumor-mongering as an act of sabotage
and would have no other choice but to apply the ISA because of the
urgency of the case.
</P>
<P>
"We have to take the most stern action. We fear that with the
advent of the 16th Commonwealth Games next month more rumors will
be floated. We're warning those trying to derail the Commonwealth
Games are also trying to sabotage the country and we'll resort to
the toughest action," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rumors of disturbances in the Chow Kit area in the capital city
of Kuala Lumpur last Friday, first circulated through the
Internet, had prompted city-dwellers into panic-buying of
provisions, among other things.

BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- China's Civil Affairs Ministry
opened a hotline today to solicit donations for relief work in
flood-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
This summer, a dozen provinces south of the Yangtze River have
been hit by unusually heavy rains that caused serious flooding. In
July, the Yangtze began its worst floods since 1954, affecting the
entire river basin, but especially the middle and lower reaches in
Hubei, Hunan and Jiangxi Provinces.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry last week put the death toll from the flooding at
more than 2,000, and said that some 240 million people, about a
fifth of China's population, have been affected by it.
</P>
<P>
The numbers for donation hotline are: (010) 65251532, 65251533,
and 65235511, extensions 3204, 3266, or 3268.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry has opened two accounts at the Beijing Branch of
Everbright Bank for RMB donations and at the Bank of China for
foreign currency. The account numbers are 33014-5090 and

<HEADLINE> South Korea to Register Negative Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 10 (Xinhua) -- South Korea is expected to see a
negative economic growth of six percent this year, lower than the
negative four percent set by Seoul and the International Monetary
Fund (IMF), said the central Bank of Korea Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an economic forecast report, the central bank said this
year's gross domestic product (GDP) will shrink six percent
because of continued downturns in production and consumption,
</P>
<P>
The South Korean GDP registered minus 3.8-percent growth in the
second quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
The negative four percent of GDP contraction target set by
Seoul and the IMF last December is already unattainable, said a
spokesman of the bank.
</P>
<P>
However, the bank predicted that the nation will be able to
reach the targeted current-account surplus 33-35 billion
U.S. dollars set by the IMF. South Korea's current-account
surplus hit 22.3 billion U.S. dollars in the first half of this
year.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the current business slump may hit bottom in the
fourth quarter, saying that the economic contraction will not fall
below seven percent.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, due to the worsening consumption-related
indexes, economic analysts predicted that the contraction of South
Korea's GDP would exceed 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
"But those analysts seem to be overlooking the fact that the
decline in demand for imports was far greater than the fall in
demand for locally produced goods, exerting relatively few adverse
effects on the growth of GDP," said the spokesman.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of passengers who
bought tickets from the defunct Zambian Express Airways Limited
(Zamex) are stranded in some capital cities of African countries.
</P>
<P>
The passengers are stranded in Harare, Johannesburg and
Nairobi, the routes the airlines used to service, Times of Zambia
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Zamex stopped its international flights two weeks ago and is
now placed under receivership because it depended too much on
borrowed aircraft and equipment.
</P>
<P>
Aero Zambia has offered to take over the routes operated by
the defunct airways to fly the stranded passengers, according to
the paper.
</P>
<P>
Aero Zambia said in a statement Sunday that it has applied to
the Ministry of Communications and Transport for traffic rights
to operate both the international and national routes handled by
Zamex.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministry has not made response to its
applications.
</P>
<P>
"As the only remaining major Zambian registered airline
offering both international and domestic services, Aero Zambia is
prepared to take over the routes once operated by the Zambian
Express, " said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Subject to the granting of these rights, the statement said,
Aero Zambia will commence operations on the routes with immediate
effect.
</P>
<P>
The airline has also pledged to employ most personnel of the
liquidated airline.

CANBERRA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed

<P>
NEW DELHI, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Heinous crimes like murder,
robberies and kidnappings have gone up in New Delhi this year,
said a status report on the law and order situation in the capital
by the Home Ministry here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report, put before the Delhi High Court, is expected to be
taken up for hearing Tuesday by the court. The Home Ministry in
its report admitted that heinous crimes increased from 1,520 cases
last year to 1,593 cases up to July this year with May registering
a phenomenal increase in the crime rate.
</P>
<P>
General feeling among people in the capital was that law and
order situation had deteriorated and it was not an encouraging
sign for the government, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the sharp increase of the crime rate much
to the floating population in the capital city.

<P>
MANILA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government on
Monday decided to raise its key overnight interest rates by two
percentage points effective Tuesday following the alarming fall of
the Philippine peso at the local foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
Gabriel Singson, governor of the Central Bank of the
Philippines, told reporters that speculation and panic hit the
market anew Monday where the peso fell to an intra-day low of
44.79 pesos to one U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The central bank decided to raise its key overnight interest
rates, from 13 percent to 15 percent for overnight borrowing and
from 15 percent to 17 percent for overnight lending.
</P>
<P>
The peso on Monday fell to 44.79 pesos to one dollar from
Friday's low of 43.49 pesos to one dollar before closing at 44.18
to one dollar.
</P>
<P>
Singson said that the Monetary Board, the highest policy-making
body of the central bank, approved the increase in its overnight
interest rates following clear indication of speculation and panic
in the market.
</P>
<P>
The Monetary Board, he said, would continue to monitor the
situation and would meet again if any further action needs to be
taken.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Australian Ties Based on Strong Foundation: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer said here Monday Australia and China had
established a strong, robust framework for the ties which allows
the two nations to build mutual understanding, reach common ground
and explore areas of difference openly and confidently.
</P>
<P>
In an opening speech to the ongoing dialogue on human rights
between the two nations, the foreign minister said the bilateral
relationship was based on a strong foundation: common interests
and complementarities, mutual respect and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
He described the first level of dialogue between the two
nations, or ministerial visits, as stronger than ever.
</P>
<P>
Since Australian Prime Minister John Howard's visit to China in
March 1997, Zhu Rongji, then deputy premier of China, Li Ruihuan,
senior Chinese leader, and Defense Minister Chi Haotian had
visited Australia, Downer explained.
</P>
<P>
He said Australia looked forward to a visit in the next couple
of months by Wei Jianxing, another senior Chinese leader.
</P>
<P>
"(Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Trade Minister Tim)
Fischer and I will continue to foster the strong personal
relationships we have established with our colleagues there," the
foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say the second level of dialogue between the two
nations, or the consultative mechanisms where officials implement
the intentions of ministers, had also made great progress.
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad to say we have made great progress at this level,
too, and across the whole range of our common interests: economic,
defense and political," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past year, in addition to this dialogue, we have
established bilateral talks on regional security and annual
discussion between our defense forces. And we have begun to
re-focus the work of the Joint Ministerial Economic Commission."
</P>
<P>
The Australian delegation to the current closed-door dialogue
is headed by Kim Jones, deputy secretary of the Australian Foreign
Affairs and Trade Department, while the Chinese delegation is
headed by Yang Jiechi, deputy foreign affairs minister.
</P>
<P>
The dialogue, the second of its kind following a similar one
held in Beijing in 1997, would end Tuesday.

<P>
BRUSSELS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- A strike by locomotive drivers
paralyzed commuting train services in southeastern Belgium on
Monday, affecting the services in other parts of the country as
well.
</P>
<P>
Belgian television RTBF said that the strike that started over
the weekend mostly affected the line from Arlon, a Belgian city
bordering Luxembourg, to Brussels via Namur.
</P>
<P>
Also severely affected were lines between Brussels and the
eastern city of Liege and between the capital city and the
southern town of Mons.
</P>
<P>
Most commuting trains were found inactive in their station
tracks by Monday morning, the television station reported.
</P>
<P>
International train services, however, were still running on
time, except for the Swiss-bound trains that were stopped in
strike-affected Arlon.
</P>
<P>
Fast-train service Thalys, linking up with Paris and Amsterdam,
were leaving and arriving in central Brussels according to
schedule, RTBF said.
</P>
<P>
The labor and management were expected to meet late Monday
morning to decide whether to continue the strike that was not
called by the trade union of the railway SNCB.
</P>
<P>
The strike was raking havoc among local holiday-makers who were
running away from cities and towns to either the country's seaside
or inland mountainous resorts during their summer recess that
started in early August.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Calls for Developing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie here Monday called for developing agri-based economy to
improve the welfare of the people.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia could never improve the welfare of its people unless
it develops an economy based on agriculture, the president said at
a meeting to mark the 3rd National Technology Awakening Day.
</P>
<P>
Habibie said the protracted monetary crisis has posed obstacles
to the country's businesses and these will take time to overcome.
Yet, the same crisis has not affected the welfare of farmers
outside Java island, particularly those who produce crops for
export, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This proves that we cannot successfully improve the people's
welfare unless we seriously develop an agriculture-based economy,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
He however said that efforts to improve the agricultural sector
need technological support.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has to harness all its agricultural potentials
without depending much on imported technology and chemical
substances, he said, adding that developing the country's own
technology would be a good way to overcome the present economic
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, a big agricultural country in Asia, was
self-sufficient in rice production in 1984. However, it started to
import rice in 1990 because of the decline in rice production.
</P>
<P>
This year, Indonesia is expected to import 3.1 million tons of
rice to meet the increasing demand in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) will sign an agreement of
intent on August 18 committing to pushing the peace process in the
southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada may grace the signing ceremony to be
held in Cotobato City, capital of Maguindanao province in
Mindanao, MILF consultant Alunan Glang said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Estrada is expected to meet MILF chairman Hashim Salamat.
</P>
<P>
Glang said the signing will signal the resumption of the
low-level exploratory talks between the government and the MILF.
</P>
<P>
The talks were temporarily halted due to the holding of the
national elections in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
The signing, Glang said, was earlier scheduled on August 12 but
was deferred following a request from the government peace panel.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is a breakaway faction of the mainstream Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF) which signed a peace treaty with the
government in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The government has been negotiating with the MILF since January
1997, but the two sides have so far failed to open formal peace
talks.

<HEADLINE> 182 Confirmed Dead in Nairobi Bomb Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Office of President of
Kenya said Monday that 182 people have been confirmed dead in
Friday's bomb blast in Nairobi and the total casualties exceeded
5,000.
</P>
<P>
The last U.S. embassy official missing has been found dead,
leading the Americans killed in the blast to 12, U.S. embassy
spokesman Chris Scharf said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers found two bodies early Monday in the rubble of
the destroyed building right next to the U.S. embassy.
</P>
<P>
Around 200 rescuers from Kenya, Israel, Britain, the United
States and France are working on the bomb debris around the
clock. The rescue work is expected to end Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Several eye-witnesses said they saw a covered van, three
Arab-looking men and heard several gunshots when a huge car bomb
blew up.
</P>
<P>
A wounded woman at the Nairobi Hospital told Xinhua that just
minutes before the bombing, she, sitting in her car parked meters
away from the ruined Ufundi-Cooperative House, saw three
Arab-looking men with a Mitsubishi Canter van trying to enter the
parking place between the U.S. Embassy and the Ufundi House.
</P>
<P>
The East African weekly newspaper reported Monday: " Both
Kenyan police and U.S. Embassy officials agreed that the vehicle
used in the bombing was a covered pick-up van and that at least
three Arab-looking men were involved."
</P>
<P>
The report quoted some witnesses as saying that there was an
exchange of gunfire between the terrorists who jumped out of the
van and U.S. marines. Another man remained in the vehicle.
Shortly afterwards the bomb detonated.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi said Sunday the Kenyan police
are now pursuing several clues on the blast but withheld details.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of experts from the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) are arriving in Nairobi to probe into the
explosion.
</P>
<P>
U.S. embassy spokesman Bill Barr said earlier that the U.S.
administration will cooperate with Kenya in probing the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Following the bombing, the Kenyan government has taken
measures to boost security in all diplomatic areas, airports,
ports and other entrances of the east African country.

<HEADLINE> Islamic World Eager to Increase Inter-Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Islamic countries are eager
to achieve the goal of 10 to 13 percent increase of inter-trade
within the next three years, chairman of the Islamic Development
Bank (IDB) Ahmad Mohammed Ali said.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed was speaking in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia Sunday night when
meeting with a team appointed to study increasing inter-trade in
the Islamic world, the Kuwait News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The IDB chairman hoped the team will be able to help achieve
the goals set by the Islamic bank in order to deal with the
challenges facing the Islamic nations in the fields of finance and
economy.
</P>
<P>
The team was appointed to study development of inter-trade
among member states of the Organization of the Islamic Conference
(OIC). They will work according to a resolution approved at the
eighth OIC summit in the Iranian capital of Tehran last December.
</P>
<P>
The summit called for boosting economic, trade and financial
cooperation among Islamic countries. It also called for expanding
investments in member states.
</P>
<P>
The IDB has been playing an important role in strengthening
social and economic development plans in the Islamic world. Since
its establishment in 1975, the bank has provided around 20 billion
U.S. dollars of easy loans to member states, among which 13
billion dollars were used to finance trade.
</P>
<P>
The Jeddah-based bank has as its members 50 Islamic countries
all over the world.

CAIRO, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Investments in Israel's high-tech companies during
the first half of this year rose by 70 percent compared with the
same period of last year, a report published on the Jerusalem Post
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report worked out by an Israeli accounting firm showed that
the investments stood at 276 million U.S. dollars in the first six
months of 1998, 114 million dollars more than in the same period
of 1997.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel exported 1.76 billion dollars worth of
metal and electricity during the first half of 1998, an increase
of 20.5 percent from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Manufacturers Association said the increase, the
biggest in five years, resulted from low domestic demands which
have forced the companies in the sector to seek fortunes abroad.
</P>
<P>
DAMASCUS -- Syria has decided to lower the customs duties by 25
percent on domestic-made goods exported to Lebanon, the
Arabic-language daily Al Hayat reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The decision will be carried out as of next year.
</P>

AMMAN -- Jordan and Israel are closely cooperating in
developing the labor-intensive industry, the semi-official Jordan
Times daily said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Thirty Jordanian textile companies are joining efforts with 17
Israeli firms in producing ready-made garments destined for the
United States, the daily quoted Shaul Sasson, trade official at

SHANGHAI, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai Metallurgy Holdings
and Shanghai Meishan Group Co. Ltd. will be merged with Shanghai
Baoshan Steel Complex, a deal that is expected to account for 14
percent of China's total steel output.
</P>
<P>
A team of top executives from the three State-owned steel
companies has been set up to negotiate the restructuring details,
which are expected to be completed in October.
</P>
<P>
The merger will make the company more competitive at home and
overseas and have 20 percent of China's metallurgical industry
asset value.
</P>
<P>
Sheng Huaren, minister in charge of the China Economic and
Trade Commission, said here that the 80 billion-yuan merger is in
compliance with the government's strategy of state-sector reforms
and will help Shanghai reach its goal of becoming a steel product
and technology development center.
</P>
<P>
China's metallurgical industry is shifting its focus from
quantity to quality and trying to get 95 percent of the domestic
market by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
The country plans to have four large steel enterprise groups,
one of which is Baoshan, producing 40 percent of the nation's
steel by the year 2000. The industry has a goal of 107 million
tons of steel output this year, with profits of 2.5 billion yuan.

<P>
TOKYO, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices tumbled in Tokyo
Monday with the key Nikkei index falling for the six consecutive
trading day as last week's drop in New York and Asian stocks
continued to haunt investors.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange sank 202.75 points, or 1.28
percent, from last Friday's finish to end at 15,626.42.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, lost 18.21 points, or 1.49 percent, to
1,207.09.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section fell to an estimated 350 million
shares from 370.03 million shares last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan was the day's most heavily
traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Banking shares took the biggest fall as opposition parties in
the Diet (parliament) Monday criticized Japanese Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi's proposals to boost the country's financial system.
</P>
<P>
From start to finish, investors seemed determined to push
stocks down to their June levels, when the Nikkei mostly hovered
between 15,000 and 15,500, traders said.
</P>
<P>
They noted that it was due to a fresh realization of the poor
state of Japan's economy and how it helped trigger major falls
last week in the stock exchanges of New York, Hong Kong and
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,335 issues listed on the First Section, losers
outstripped gainers 1,014 to 152, with 101 issues remaining
unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Keeping Close Watch on Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Developments in Asia's
troubled economies will largely determine how well Boeing fare,
the Seattle Times on Sunday quoted executives of the Seattle-based
airplane manufacturer as saying.
</P>
<P>
Boeing chairman Phil Condit and president Harry Stonecipher
told the newspaper that the historic order-and-delivery cycle that
began in 1995 is now virtually assured of topping out with next
year's expected delivery of 620 aircraft. Year 2000 production
will fall by 10 percent or more, perhaps even dropping below
1998's planned 550 planes.
</P>
<P>
What remains unclear is how rapidly demand will fall in the
subsequent years, Condit said.
</P>
<P>
The worst case for the company would be if Japan slid into a
deeper recession, dragging down the healthier U.S. and European
economies. As air travel dropped off, carriers would seek delays
or cancellations. That would reduce jet deliveries sharply in the
early years of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Boeing has said that Asia is expected to account for about 20
deferred deliveries a year for the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Asian buying most directly affects production of big widebody
airliners such as the 777 and the 747 jumbo jets.
</P>
<P>
Boeing managers are mindful that double-digit travel-growth in
Asia have slumped to about two percent annually. Their assessments
see continuing delivery delays from slumping economies in
Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the aerospace giant has said that operating profits
on its commercial-airplane business, which exclude the cost of
research and development, are expected to range from zero to one
percent of sales in 1998. The same measure should range between
two and four percent of sales in 1999, still far below the 10
percent levels that investors expected two year ago.
</P>
<P>
But if Asia stabilizes, Condit said, the company can again
realize healthy profits from the commercial-airplane boom.

</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- After the double attack which killed at least 170 and
injured 5,000, Saudi millionaire Oussama ben Laden is designated
as the number one suspect. The Yemen-born Laden has an estimated
fortune of 300 million U.S. dollars and is now living in exile in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
-- The popularity rate of the German Christian Democratic Union
(CDU) led by Chancellor Helmut Kohl has rebounded and is only
three points lower than the opposition Social Democratic Party of
Gerard Shroeder, according to a poll published by the German
weekly Spiegel.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- While the claim by an unknown organization, "the Islamic
Army for the Liberation of Holy Places," of the attacks against
American embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam seem to have
confirmed an Islamic terrorist trail, the official casualties of
the two attacks has risen to 174 dead.
</P>
<P>
-- Ozone pollution, caused by waste gas from cars and
reinforced by the heatwave and lack of wind, hit many regions of
France last weekend. The level-2 pollution alarm sounded in Paris,
Marseille, Lyon, Grenoble, Bordeaux, Strasbourg and Metz.

<HEADLINE> Plugging Yangtze River Dike Breach At Jiujiang in Final Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JIUJIANG, August 10 (Xinhua) -- A 60-meter breach in the
Yangtze River dike at Jiujiang, a city in east China's Jiangxi
Province, was reportedly close to being plugged on Monday in the
worst flooding since 1954.
</P>
<P>
Jiujiang is an industrial and tourist city on the middle
reaches of the Yangtze and has a population of 500,000 in a
30-sq.km. area.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers had built a framework, which was developed by army
engineers in 1996, at the breach by 1:30 p.m. by hammering over
2,000 steel pipes into the ground, according to Major General Yu
Haisen who led a 225-member army expert team.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 soldiers and civilians have been working on
the dike since it broke at 1:10 p.m. on Friday. Many have suffered
heat stroke because of the high temperatures and humidity.
</P>
<P>
On the first two days, they sank eight boats and dumped
truckloads of rock, rice, soybeans and whatever else was at hand
into the breach because of a severe shortage of fill
material. Later, truckloads of rock were shipped in and 5,000
cubic meters of rock are on order.
</P>
<P>
People have built a 5,000-m. dike at a spot two kilometers from
the breach, and a second one, 3,000 meters long, that is 4
kilometers from there to keep a 4-sq-km area in the western part
of the city from getting flooded more.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zhenglai, deputy director of the city Water Conservation
Bureau and head of flood-control headquarters, has not been to bed
for three days, as he moved around directing resettlement of
residents and construction of the dikes.
</P>
<P>
The western part of the city, including a new industrial zone
and 8 enterprises and institutions, with a population of 35,810,
is one meter deep in water, but only 10,000 people have been
affected by the flooding, and water, electricity, and daily
necessities are in adequate supply, Chen says.

NANJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Development zones have become a

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Witnesses Speak of Van, Men, Gunshots when </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Several eye-witnesses have said
that they saw a covered van, three Arab-looking men and heard
several gunshots when a huge car bomb blew up damaging a building
next to the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Nation Disaster Central said Sunday night that the
official death toll from the blast has risen to 174. The number
of the injured is around 5,000.
</P>
<P>
A wounded woman at the Nairobi Hospital told Xinhua that just
minutes before the bombing, she, sitting in her car parking
meters away the ruined Ufindi-Cooperative House, saw three
Arab-looking men with a Mitsubishi Canter van trying to enter the
parking place between the U.S. Embassy and the Ufindi House.
</P>
<P>
At the time, she saw the three men appearing to have a fierce
argument with a security guard at the entrance of the parking
place, which belongs to the U.S. Embassy.
</P>
<P>
E.K. Mureithi, the Managing Director of the Cooperative Bank
of Kenya, was in his office in the seriously-damaged skyscraper
right next to the Ufindi House when the bomb blasted. He was not
hurt but eight staff are still missing.
</P>
<P>
Mureithi said he heard two big bangs with more than 10 seconds
apart and between the two bangs he heard several gunshots.
</P>
<P>
"I'm quite sure I've heard gunshots because I know what it's
like," said Mureithi.
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. Embassy spokesman Bill Barr said Sunday that he
was staying at the second floor of the embassy but he could not
remember to have heard any gunshots. He also offered no comments
about what the witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
The East African weekly newspaper reported Monday: " Both
Kenyan police and U.S. Embassy officials agreed that the vehicle
used in the bombing was a covered pick-up van and that at least
three 'Arab-looking men' were involved."
</P>
<P>
The van, identified as a Mitsubishi Canter, was finally
allowed through into the embassy's parking place, then it
reversed with the back door facing the embassy, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted some witnesses as saying that there was an
exchange of gunfire between the terrorists who jumped out of the
van and U.S. marines. Another man remained in the vehicle.
Shortly afterwards the bomb detonated.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi said Sunday the Kenyan police
now are pursuing several clues on the blast but withheld details.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of experts from the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) are arriving in Nairobi to probe into the
explosion.
</P>
<P>
A 62-member rescue team from the U.S. Office of Foreign
Disaster Assistance arrived in Nairobi earlier Sunday morning,
but they are mainly working in the seriously-damaged U.S.
Embassy, which was the target of the bombing.
</P>
<P>
The team's spokesman, Michael Reilly, said the fact that about
3,000 gallons of diesel is stored in the basement of the embassy
poses a great threat. The team has started to pomp them out.
</P>
<P>
Following the bombing, the Kenyan government has taken
measures to boost security in all diplomatic areas, airports,
ports and other entrances of the east African country.
</P>
<P>
The government has also allocated 50 million Shillings (some
850,000 U.S. Dollars) as an emergency fund for the tragedy.

material suppliers in Zhanjiang have provided 13 million yuan in
loans and 20 million yuan-worth of farm materials for the drought
relief effort. Water conservation departments have allocated 19.8
million yuan for building more wells and for repairing

<HEADLINE> Man Detained for Tanzania Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian police has
detained a man of Arab origin in connection with the bombing of
the United States embassy in Tanzania, Dar es Salaam-based
newspaper Daily Mail said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted unidentified sources as saying that the man
were spotted in Dar es Salaam on the very day of the blast and
plans were immediately arranged to trail him.
</P>
<P>
The man left Dar es Salaam for the northern town of Arusha and
checked in at a guest house in the downtown.
</P>
<P>
He left the guest house Saturday morning and went to a mosque
where he prayed and stayed for the whole day.
</P>
<P>
Not knowing he was being tailed, the man left the town on
Sunday morning for the northern border post of Namanga. He was
apprehended while attempting to cross into Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The report, however, could not be confirmed by the government
authorities. The Arusha Regional Commissioner, Daniel ole
Njoolay, told Xinhua Saturday over telephone, "I am not aware of
the fact."

<P>
The bombing of the US embassy in Tanzania last Friday has left
10 people dead and more than 70 others injured.
</P>
<P>
Sources said fortunately an underground fuel reservoir close
to the blast site did not explode, otherwise the casualties would
have been much heavier.

<HEADLINE> Support Rate for N.Z. Major Ruling Party Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The support rate of the
National Party, a major ruling party in New Zealand, has dropped
six percentage points to 32.6 percent from the last poll in May,
according to the latest New Zealand Herald-DigiPoll.
</P>
<P>
The current support rate is below the level when Jenny Shipley
ousted Jim Bolger as New Zealand Prime Minister last November.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 700 people, with a margin of error of 3.7
percent, was taken last week and its results were carried Monday
in The New Zealand Herald, an Auckland-based newspaper.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, the support rate for the Labor Party,
the major opposition party in the country, has surged from 34.7
percent in the last poll to 46.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The support rate for New Zealand First, the partner of the
National Party in forming the current coalition government, has
improved slightly to 2.2 percent, up from 1.7 percent in the May
poll.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Alliance, another opposition Party, gained a
9.7 percent support rate, up from 8.5 percent in the last poll.
</P>
<P>
Analyzing the Polling results, the local TV station said Monday
 evening that the center-left combination of the Labor Party and
the Alliance would have enough majority to take office if an
election was held now.
</P>
<P>
In the preferred Prime Minister polling, the Labor leader,
Helen Clark, regained top spot with a support rate of 24.8
percent, nudging past Jenny Shipley on 22.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the May poll, the support rates for Jenny Shipley and Helen
Clark were 26.8 percent and 18.5 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The latest poll showed that New Zealanders are gloomier about
the economy of the country, as 43.3 percent of those polled said
it is a lot worse than a year ago, and 32.7 percent said a little
worse.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead over the next year, 37.5 percent of respondents
believe they will be worse off and 40 percent think they will be
about the same, the survey said.

<HEADLINE> Customs Help With Foreign Trade in Ethnic Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Urumqi Customs Office has
implemented preferential policies to help the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region develop its foreign trade at the time of the
Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Situated in far-off northwest China, the region has established
close trade links with Japan, the Republic of Korea, the
Philippines, and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis was also felt in Xinjiang in the form of a
5.5 percent drop in foreign trade in the first quarter of this
year.
</P>
<P>
The new policies are aimed at improving the management of
foreign trade enterprises, and tightening control over tax
reduction and exemption for equipment imports. Enterprises which
enjoy tax exemptions are able to go through the customs
formalities within two business days.
</P>
<P>
To improve the region's processing industry, which fell behind
the country's average level, the Customs Office has enhanced
efforts to refund taxes on cotton processing, which accounted for
80 percent of its processing trade last year. It also authorized
subordinate offices to exercise approval rights for processing
trade.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang is making the most of its geographical and
resource-rich advantages to develop tourism with neighboring
countries. As a result, income from tourism reached 350 million
U.S. dollars last year.

<HEADLINE> Manila Asked to Devise Multi-sector Funding Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank (WB) has advised
the Philippine government to have multi-sector funding programs in
order to minimize projects' supervision cost and related technical
assistance loses.
</P>
<P>
In a report available here Monday, the WB, one of the country's
biggest donors, said that the spread of small-scale infrastructure
projects throughout the country becomes costly to manage and
adequately supervised.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that the Philippines develops projects specially
designed for the demands of the local communities and allows local
government units to finance and supervise these projects.
</P>
<P>
Geographic concentration in donor efforts proved to be
effective in speeding up the implementation of projects including
rural roads, it said. Donor programs in the past have been plagued
with lengthy delays due to budget constraints and other technical
problems.
</P>
<P>
On the lack of sufficient funds to finance rural capital
investment, the World Bank said local government units (LGUs) must
also have the access to the capital markets or to grants from
government or donors.
</P>
<P>
The WB said political incentives and other measures to ensure
infrastructure maintenance must be devised in order to reduce the
country's capital assets loses.
</P>
<P>
Such incentives include rewards or matching grants to those
communities which do maintain their infrastructure, and limiting
access to future funds to those which do not.
</P>
<P>
Another instrument may be to convert earlier grant provisions
to loans where maintenance is clearly inadequate, said the bank.

<HEADLINE> 360 Ugandan Kids Abducted by ADF Rebels Since </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- About 360 children in
Uganda's western district of Kasese have been abducted by rebels
of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) since they first attacked
the district in 1996.
</P>
<P>
District Council Chairman Yokasi Bihande made the remarks during
a recent visit by President Yoweri Museveni to the area, the New
Vision paper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Bihande said that there are 59,864 internally displaced people
in the district, 37,576 of them are children under seven.
</P>
<P>
These children live in various camps in the district in most
inhuman conditions. Some were maimed by landmines, he added.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the government for relief
items, loans and land for the displaced to resume their normal
economic activities.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he hailed the government for providing
universal primary education for children, saying that the number
of school going children there has been doubled.
</P>
<P>
ADF rebels came to haunt the area in late 1996. Estimated at
several hundreds, the rebels often abduct children and students
to reinforce their ranks.
</P>
<P>
In a June attack on the Kichwamba Technical College in
Kabarole district, more than 100 students were abducted.
</P>
<P>
Last week, they launched a surprise attack on a Kasese Town,
hours before Museveni arrived there for a visit.
</P>
<P>
Their intensified abduction activities and inhuman attacks on
civilians have justified the government's conviction that the
rebels should be wiped out by force.

<HEADLINE> Currency Turmoil Sets Back Philippine Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The deepening economic crisis,
coupled with the high rates being charged by local hotels, may
setback the Philippines' tourism industry this year, Tourism
Secretary Gemma Cruz Araneta said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Araneta told reporters that the budget cut in her office this
year will surely affect its promotional activities for the country
abroad.
</P>
<P>
"That problem ... affects the entry of international tourists
because if you can not fund your promotional activities abroad,
then you will not be able to reach all the markets you want to
search," she said.
</P>
<P>
Araneta said the high hotel rates in the country are
discouraging international tourists to come to the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
She said the Philippines has one of the highest if not the
highest hotel rates among the members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
"According to the private sector--those involved in the tour
and travel business--the Philippines is an expensive tourist
destination, because the hotel rates are quoted in dollars," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Araneta said the hotel owners are not willing to lower their
prices and charge in the local currency.
</P>
<P>
She said there will still be an increase in the number of
tourist arrivals but not at 8 percent increase earlier projected
by her office because of the currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
She said because of the regional currency turmoil, possibly
only 3 percent increase might be realized.
</P>
<P>
Araneta said while Asian tourists are now thinning out in the
Philippines, there is also a noticeable increase in the number of
European tourists.
</P>
<P>
She said that a possible explanation to this is the fact that
unlike Asia, Europe is not affected by the crisis and is currently
experiencing economic boom.

<HEADLINE> Iran Protests Taliban's Holding of Its Diplomats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran has lodged a strong protest
to the Afghan Taliban militia against its detaining 11 Iranian
diplomats in Mazar-e-Sharif in northern Afghanistan, Tehran radio
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi in a
telephone conversation with his Pakistani counterpart Sartaj Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Condemning Taliban's action "law-breaching," Kharrazi said Iran
expects Pakistan to make efforts for the diplomats' release as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The student militia, believed to have been supported by
Pakistan, has won control over most of Afghanistan and imposed a
strict version of Islamic rule there.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian diplomats were taken captive by the Taliban on
Saturday after the militia conquered Mazar-e-Sharif, the main
stronghold of the Northern Alliance headed by ousted President
Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi refuted as "a mere lie" claims by Taliban officials
that Iranian diplomats had left their consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif
before the Taliban forces took over it.
</P>
<P>
He said that soon after the Taliban forces entered the Iranian
consulate, Taliban and Pakistani officials informed Iranian
officials that those diplomats were sound and safe.
</P>
<P>
This undoubtedly indicated that the Iranian diplomats were at
the hands of the Taliban, Kharrazi said.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Aziz said that Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif has ordered to make efforts to find the Iranian diplomats
and secure their release.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the whereabouts of the Iranian
diplomats would be clear after contacts between Pakistani
officials with the Taliban authorities.

of east China's Zhejiang Province, are attending an environmental
protection training course in sweltering weather.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Favors Integrated Talks With India: Qazi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Ambassador to India
Ashraf Jehangir Qazi has expressed his country's desire for
comprehensive and integrated dialogue with New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
In an interview to a private TV channel here to be telecast
Monday, Qazi has denied that his country was undermining the
bilateral process between Pakistan and India as said and reported
by India recently.
</P>
<P>
He said that there was a misunderstanding that Pakistan wanted
to exclusively focus on Kashmir. "We are neither against a
comprehensive nor are we against an integrated dialogue because
that is what we want," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some Indian leaders and press in their recent statements and
reports said that Pakistan had tried to undermine the bilateral
process during the recent talks between the prime ministers of the
two countries on the sidelines of the summit of the South Asian
Association for Regional cooperation (SAARC) in Colombo on July
29-31.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Foreign Secretaries of the two countries could
well have had a date right now for their next meeting, Qazi said.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, the Pakistan ambassador reiterated
Islamabad's stand that Kashmir was the "core issue" between the
two countries. "Kashmir is the live issue which feeds into the
public opinion in a way none of the other issues does," he said.
</P>
<P>
If the issue was not addressed, it would have that negative
feed-back into the public opinion of both the countries which
would constrict the possibility of forward movement on all other
subjects, he further said.

<HEADLINE> Developments) Major Progress Reported in Plugging Yangtze Dike in Jiujiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JIUJIANG, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Efforts to plug a 60-meter
breach in the Yangtze River dike in Jiujiang, a city in east
China's Jiangxi Province, have reportedly made substantial
progress today.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers successfully put up a framework by striking hundreds
of steel pipes into the breach at 1:30 p.m. and, later, sandbags
and other fill materials will be added to the framework to plug
the breach completely.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 soldiers and civilians have been working hard
and steadily on the dike since it breached at 1:10 p.m. on Friday,
but technical problems, a lack of expertise and inadequate
equipment slowed the work.
</P>
<P>
Many soldiers and civilians working on the breach have suffered
heat stroke because of the high temperatures and humidity,
according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
The torrential floods, the worst since 1954, also are causing
problems in the repair effort.
</P>
<P>
On the first day the dike burst, people sank eight boats and
dumped truckloads of rocks, rice, soybeans and whatever else was
at hand into the breach because of a severe shortage of fill
material. Later, truckloads of rock and stones were shipped from
other areas under a provincial government order.
</P>
<P>
A team of army experts has been summoned from Hebei Province in
north China to help Jiujiang plug the breach, according to local
officials.
</P>
<P>
The army experts decided to hammer in dozens of steel pipes in
four rows into the breached dyke, while a 90-meter cofferdam has
been built next to the breach to slow the flow of water.
</P>
<P>
"The previous dumping of boats and other materials has slowed
down the water flow by one-third and laid a good foundation for
our operation," said an expert.
</P>
<P>
There have been no reported casualties at the breach so far,
according to Governor Shu Shengyou and some on-the-spot witnesses.
</P>
<P>
People have built a dike 5,000 meters long at a spot two
kilometers from the breach, and a second dike 3,000 meters long
and four kilometers away from the first, to prevent a four-sq-km
flooded area in the western part of the city from expanding
further.
</P>
<P>
The two newly-built dikes are designed to protect
infrastructures, including two waterworks and two thermal power
plants.
</P>
<P>
"With the completion of these two in-city dikes, I'm now quite
at ease," said Chen Zhenglai, deputy director of the Municipal
Water Conservation Bureau and head of the flood-control
headquarters for the city's urban districts.
</P>
<P>
"The residents have voluntarily sent meals and drinks to the
builders of the dikes," he said, adding that locals are more
confident.
</P>
<P>
Chen has not been to bed for three consecutive days as he moved
around to direct the resettlement of the affected residents and
construction of the dikes.
</P>
<P>
The flooded western part of the city, stranded in one-m-deep
water, includes a new industrial zone and home to 18 communities
and eight enterprises and institutions, with a population of
35,810.
</P>
<P>
Since the breach occurred, only 10,000 people affected by
floodwaters have been resettled in their relatives' houses or
factory buildings.
</P>
<P>
"Tents are not necessary for these relocated people, because we
have enough space for them to stay," said Chen.
</P>
<P>
So far, supplies of running water, electricity and daily
necessities have been adequate in the city, he said.
</P>
<P>
The city proper of Jiujiang, an industrial center and tourist
attraction on the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, has an
urban population of 500,000 and covers an area of about 30 sq km.

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Assist Thai Public-Sector Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank is to extend a
400 million U.S. dollar loan to assist Thailand's public-sector
reform, which aims to overhaul the bloated government bureaucracy,
The Nation newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted an aide-memoire of a World Bank mission as
saying that the program aims to knock into Thailand's public
sector, which is seen as an impediment to the country's economic
recovery.
</P>
<P>
The document, a preliminary agreement between the World Bank
and the Thai government, gives priority to the need for the public
sector to modernize its fiscal management, downsize its workforce,
rationalize work processes and increase accountability.
</P>
<P>
The proposed loan, which can probably be dispensed by next
year, will be a major boost for the Office of the Civil Service
Commission (OCSC)'s planned drastic bureaucratic reform, which has
been bogged down by the lack of funding.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's public sector has become overstaffed and underpaid,
and administrative procedures have contributed to a lack of
motivation and weak performance.
</P>
<P>
The number of ministries and agencies have increased over time,
and the difference in salaries of civil servants and those in the
private sector during the boom years led to a brain drain.
</P>
<P>
The OCSC has already laid down guidelines for a sweeping
government bureaucratic reform, requiring government agencies to
rethink their roles as providers of public services.
</P>
<P>
The commission has also prepared an early-retirement plan, but
the Chuan Leekpai administration has shelved the proposal due to
the financial crisis and the consequent crunch on the budget.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has indicated that part of the public-sector
reform loan can be used to help finance the early-retirement
package.
</P>
<P>
According to latest statistics, there are 2,074,805 officials
and employees on the government payroll. Their salaries and
welfare benefits swallow up about 40 percent of the government's
annual budget.

<P>
BANGKOK, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Labor and Social Welfare
Ministry of Thailand plans to provide education and occupational
training for the unemployed and their children, it was learned
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
A source from the ministry said Monday that the project aims to
help bread-winners who have been laid off and are unable to find
new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, adults with education less than Grade 9
(junior high school level) will receive occupational training from
the Labor Skill Development Department while those who have
studied above Grade 9 or those with a vocational diploma will be
assisted in pursuing their studies.
</P>
<P>
Children of laid-off workers who have studied less than Grade 9
will be entitled to further their studies without having to pay
for tuition. Those educated above Grade 10 will be eligible for
educational loan.
</P>
<P>
The source said the ministry will seek cooperations from
relevant ministries, such as the University Affairs Ministry and
Education Ministry.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 500,000 people would be put through
the program, which needed about 25 billion baht (625 million U.S.
dollars). Part of the money would be taken from the Social Welfare
Fund, the source said.

BANGKOK, August 10 (Xinhua) -- More centers to train elephants
will be set up in Thailand to boost the country's tourism,
according to Agriculture Minister Pongpol Adireksarn.
</P>
<P>
The decision to set up the centers followed a ministerial
meeting. Tourism would provide an alternative for mahouts who
bring their animals to walk city streets and earn income by
selling fruits for the elephants to residents and tourists,
Pongpol was quoted Monday by the Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
It also prevent the beasts from being killed or maimed by
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Places to be considered as elephant training centers must
resemble forests and have the potential to be developed into
tourist spots. Each region would have at least one center where
training shelter and medical care would be provided, Pongpol said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are centers in Chiang Mai, Lampang, Chon Buri
and Surin provinces as well as Bangkok.

<HEADLINE> Preparations For Major Flood Diversion Scheme Nearly Complete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Preparations for a major diversion
scheme to save big cities downstream on the Yangtze River are
being given the final touches in the Jingjiang Flood Diversion
Zone in central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
All local residents in the zone, in Gong'an County, who could
be affected by the discharged floodwaters, reportedly have been
removed to shelters or their relatives' homes.
</P>
<P>
To minimize losses to local people, the State Flood Control and
Drought Relief Headquarters has reduced the number of people to be
relocated to 110,000, far less than the previous figure of
330,000. The zone has a total population of 513,000.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that local officials are making final check-ups
in the villages and towns left vacant by the resettled people to
see if there is anything that needs to be salvaged.
</P>
<P>
Local residents in the diversion zone, with an average yearly
income of 1,000 yuan, are mainly farmers. Few industries have been
built in this area.
</P>
<P>
In Jianli County, 50 kilometers (km) downstream from Gong'an,
where some secondary dikes were opened on Sunday, all 50,000 local
residents living in the 180-square-kilometer diversion area have
been resettled.
</P>
<P>
Local officials have reported no casualties in Jianli's
diversion zone, which is designed to hold 800 million cubic meters
of floodwater.
</P>
<P>
The passing of the year's fourth flood crest and the diversion
in Jianli have contributed to the continued fall of the water
level on the Yangtze River at Shashi, 200 km upstream from Wuhan,
the provincial capital, which stood at 44.63 meters at 9
a.m. today, compared with 44.95 meters on Saturday morning and
44.65 meters on Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
County leaders in Jianli offered to give up some local dikes on
Saturday. But the diversion had not happened until today because
some local villagers were reluctant to move. It took local
officials some time to persuade the reluctant villagers.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji, who visited the area twice this year, on
July 6 and Aug. 8-9, placed top priority on the lives of the
people and said that no diversion program could be carried out
without relocating all affected residents.
</P>
<P>
The government is still pondering the diversion scheme in the
Jingjiang zone, but decided the program would be carried out only
when the water level at Shashi reaches 45 meters and is rising.
</P>
<P>
In the proposed major diversion action, a part of the Yangtze's
embankments in Gong'an would be dynamited and the North Flood Gate
would be opened to discharge floodwaters.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Municipal government
will start purchasing its equipment through public bids as part of
its anti-corruption campaign, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government is planning to establish a special
purchasing department to increase the number of items to be bought
through bids, such as air-conditioners, ambulances and computers.
</P>
<P>
It helps to save money when government departments buy in
wholesale, Zhou Mingchan, an official with the Municipal Bureau of
Finance, was quoted by the paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Beijing is one of the cities in a pilot program for municipal
government bidding, with other cities including Shenzhen, Kunming
and Chongqing. The idea was put forward at a national seminar held
by the Ministry of Finance in 1997.
</P>
<P>
At present, municipal governments are working according to
their individual policies, which can lead to higher purchasing
costs.
</P>
<P>
A national law on government purchasing is in the making, which
is expected to standardize the practice, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Municipal Government put the plan into action last
year, starting with contracts with a dozen of the city's garages
to take care of government vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Capital Group beat the rest of the five competitors and became
of the winner of the first bid held at the end of last month. The
company won a one-year contract to provide 100 cars and 260 jeeps,
which are worth 22.6 billion yuan (2.7 billion US dollars),
according to the paper.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 10 (Xinhua) -- China's State-sector tertiary
industry employees outnumber their counterparts in agricultural
and manufacturing State-owned firms, today's China Daily cited
official statistics.
</P>
<P>
There were 55 million workers at State-owned firms in the
tertiary industry at the end of June, compared to 51 million in
government-funded companies in the agriculture and industry,
according to urban employment figures released by the State
Statistics Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
Tertiary industry, which includes all kinds of services like
telecommunications, banking, education and public health, and jobs
of government agencies, accounted for 52 percent of employees in
the State sector in mid-1998, up 2.2 percent from the same period
of last year and representing a dominant role in employment for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
The change stemmed from bold steps to cut redundant workers
from manufacturing firms, which was accompanies by an expansion of
companies in service industries.
</P>
<P>
The bureau figures showed that between July 1997 and June 1998,
State-owned firms in the first and second industries cut 3.2
million employees, mainly from manufacturing businesses, while the
number of service industries increased by 500,000.
</P>
<P>
Development of the tertiary industry, especially in service
trades, which is strongly supported by the government, is expected
to create jobs for employees laid off by manufacturing companies.
</P>
<P>
SSB figures also indicate that China's urban working population
totaled 143.85 million by the end of June, which was 2.86 million
less than a year ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
submitted to the United States a revised draft of an agreement
that will govern Filipino soldiers visiting the U.S. for military
exercises or other official activities.
</P>
<P>
In adding this reciprocity accord to the Philippines-U.S.
Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA), the government is adding a
"sweetener" that may allow the VFA to enjoy easier sailing in the
Senate, the newspaper the Philippine Star reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The VFA, which was signed by the two countries in early 1998,
has yet to be ratified by the Philippine Senate, which has
expressed strong opposition to some provisions on the status of
visiting U.S. soldiers in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The draft, titled "U.S.-Philippine Agreement on the Treatment
of Philippine Personnel Visiting the U.S.," is a counterpart of
the VFA which will govern American military personnel visiting the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Under the draft, the Philippines will exercise jurisdiction
over any Filipino soldier who commits a crime in the U.S., except
in cases where the U.S., "after special consideration, determines
that U.S. interests require the exercise of federal or state
jurisdiction."
</P>
<P>
Philippine military personnel can travel to the U.S. in
emergency cases without passports of visas. While in the U.S.,
they will be allowed to import articles and send these back to the
Philippines free of duties and taxes.
</P>
<P>
So far, only three countries have similar arrangements with the
U.S. -- Singapore, Spain and Israel.

October.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Star on Monday quoted Finance Secretary Edgardo
Espiritu as saying the government wanted to "set a new benchmark
for sovereign issues" with the exercise.
</P>
<P>
If the flotation pushes through in October, Espiritu said the
Philippines will be the first country in the region which would
tap the international bond market since the financial crisis
erupted last year.
</P>
<P>
He said the success of the issues "is very critical" with the
government's coffers in the red amid a projected budget deficit of
70 billion pesos (1.75 billion dollars) for 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to Espiritu, the government had received offers from
13 international investment firms.
</P>
<P>
The government may ask some of the interested investment banks
to join forces especially if their proposals are similar to each
other, he said.
</P>
<P>
But he said the lead underwriter must be able to develop a
strong investor base and quote a price for the issue that would
minimize the cost of borrowing for the government.

<HEADLINE> Earthquake-Safety Regulation Takes Effect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, August 10 (Xinhua) -- An earthquake-safety
regulation for construction projects, the first such measure in
China, took effect recently in north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
"The regulation not only indicates that the management of
construction projects has come onto a legal track in Hebei, but
also serves to remind people of the quake which devastated the
city of Tangshan in Hebei Province on July 28, 1976," said Bai
Lutang, vice-chairman of the provincial People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of new China in 1949, the two earthquakes
with the largest number of casualties both took place in Hebei
Province: the quake in Xingtai city in March 1966 took some 8,000
lives; and the quake in the city of Tangshan claimed 240,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
Liu Baocai, director of the Earthquake Safety and Disaster
Relief Office of Hebei Province, said that because accurate
earthquake forecasting is still beyond our capability, the best
way to reduce losses is to improve the quake-proofing level of
construction projects.
</P>
<P>
Although on December 29, 1997, the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature, adopted
a law on earthquake safety and disaster relief, there has been no
special regulation on earthquake safety for construction projects
before the adoption of the one in Hebei, Liu said.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Wins Basketball World Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 9 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslavian caggers outwitted
their Russian peers 64-62 here Sunday to take the World Basketball
Championship title.
</P>
<P>
Zeljko Rebraca scored the team-high 16 points and 11 rebounds
to pace the European champion for its record fourth world crown
after victories in the 1970, 1978 and 1990 World Championships.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia was banned from the 1994 tournament because of war
sanctions, but has since added two straight European golds and a
silver behind the U.S. Dream Team at the 1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"After the embargo we played in four straight finals and won
three times. It's incredible. We have a lot of reason to be very
proud," said Yugoslav coach Zeljko Obradovic.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Sunday, Jason Sasser scored 23 points to help the
U.S. team without any NBA player to rout host Greece 84-61 for the
bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
In the all-European final, Rebraca, who plays for Italian club Benetton
Treviso, hit the winning free throws with 4.7 seconds left before a sellout
crowd of 18,000 at the Olympic arena.
</P>
<P>
Dejan Bodiroga chipped in 11 points and five rebounds, and was
named the MVP of the tournament as he averaged 14.7 points and 4.9
rebounds in nine games.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav squad played the final without Charlotte Hornets
center Vlade Divac and injured former NBA player Predrag Danilovic.
</P>
<P>
Sergey Panov and Igor Koudellin had 14 points apiece for Russia
who had to settle for its second straight silver medal.
</P>
<P>
Once led at 49-45 with 10:41 to play, Russia failed to score a
single goal in two minutes when Yugoslavia dumped in five points
to overtake the lead 50-49, the first lead for Yugoslavia since an
early upperhand of 10-7 in the opening minutes.
</P>
<P>
Both Rebraca and Aleksandar Djordjevic then scored 11 of their
team's last 14 points. Djordjevic, who missed his first five
shots, hit his first basket, a 3-pointer with 2:42 left which put
the European champions ahead 53-50. Rebraca blocked Mikhail M
ikhailov's shot then had a put-back with two free throws.
</P>
<P>
Sergey Babkov, who scored 31 points to lead Russia past the
United States in the semifinals, was held to four points Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Russia twice led by seven points in either halves, but was
unable to beat off the strong comeback of their Yugoslav peers.
</P>
<P>
In the third-place game, the United States went on an early
25-6 run and took a 48-27 lead at halftime.
</P>
<P>
Dimitri Papanikolaou led the hosts with 18 points.
</P>
<P>
In the consolation actions, Spain beat Italy 64-61 for fifth
place, while Lithuania edged Argentina 77-76 for seventh.

Shuler with 3.8 seconds remaining gave the Washington Mystics a
76-74 win over the Los Angeles Sparks in a WNBA game here Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The victory was Washington's first since July 11. The expansion

total games it has played, Washington only won three.
</P>

</P>
<P>

and Page had 12.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Tourism Earnings Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's foreign exchange
earnings from tourism were down 23.6 percent during the first
semester of this year, the Indonesian Observer reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
During this period, the foreign exchange earnings down to only
1.6 billion U.S. dollars from 2.1 billion U.S. dollars in the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
The drop was mainly caused by the decline in the number of
foreign tourists visiting Indonesia between January and June this
year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
During that time only 1,575,394 foreigners visited, compared to
2,019,000 in the same period last year, a drop of 22.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Tourism officials are now worried that unless something is done
to improve the image of the Indonesian tourism industry soon, the
problem will continue until the end of this year, the report
added.

<HEADLINE> Arsenal Beats Manchester United at Charity Shield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 9 (Xinhua) -- Double winners Arsenal blanked
Manchester United 3-0 in the Charity Field at Wembley on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Gunners, who last played at the stadium in the FA cup
victory that secured them the double, looked totally at home in the
 traditional curtain-raiser to the English season.
</P>
<P>
Goals by Marc Overmas, Christopher Wreh and Nicolas Anelka
completed a dominating performance that will confirm Arsenal as
early favourites for the Premiership which gets under way next
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal took control of the match afer 34 minutes when Dutchman
Overmars gave them the lead and went on to dominate a
listless-looking United with further goals from Liberian
substitute Wreh after 57 minutes and a superb third from French
striker Anelka after 72 minutes.
</P>
<P>
United's poor afternoon was summed up perfectly when substitute
Teddy Sheringham, looking for a consolation goal, fired three
meters wide with only David Seaman to beat late in the match.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal, who ended United's two-year reign as champions with a
run of 10 successive wins in last season's run-in, looked far more
settled than United, who need to show an improvement before they
meet LKS Lodz of Poland in a Champions' League qualifier on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal as champions, have qualified automatically for the
Champions' League and will be playing their home matches in the
competition at Wembley.
</P>
<P>
It was Dennis Berkamp, Arsenal's Dutch World Cup star, who
forced the first save of the game with a low, 25-meter drive that
Peter Schmeichel clutched at the foot of the post.
</P>
<P>
But two minutes later, the Danish goalkeeper was picking the
ball out of the net when Berkamp raced down the right and
backheeled the ball in the penalty area.
</P>
<P>
With the United defence ball-watching, Anelka left the ball to
Overmas who drove it powerfully into the roof of the net from just
inside the area.
</P>
<P>
The second goal came 12 minutes into the second half when
Overmars pulled apart the United defence with a run down the
left. Anelka passed the ball to Wreh whose first shot was blocked
by Schmeichel's boot.
</P>
<P>
The ball rebounded to the Arsenal substitute who was surrounded
by United defenders but was able to roll the ball into an empty
net from 16 meters.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal hit the third with 19 minutes to go. Anelka held off a
challenge from Dutch international defender Jaap Stam and fired
the ball between Schmeichel and his near post.
</P>
<P>
United had few chances to hit back but Teddy Sheringham should
have scored a consolation goal nine minutes from the end when he
raced through, but he hit the ball well wide.
</P>
<P>
With the win, Arsenal became the first team from London to win
the Charity Shield outright since Tottenham in 1962.
</P>
<P>
Coach Arsene Wenger said: "It was important game
psychologically. It was quite level in the first half. United
played well then but both teams tired a little in the second
half."

<HEADLINE> 19th Century Painting Robbed in Auckland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- A 19th Century painting worth
two million NZ dollars (over one million U.S. dollars) was stolen
from Auckland Art Gallery Sunday, a Wellington-based newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion said the painting "Still on Top" by French-born
artist Jacques-Joseph, is one of New Zealand's most expensive and
popular European works. It depicts three people hoisting a flag
and is 87 by 53 centimeters.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, an European, aged at least 30 and
clad in black, burst through the main door with a sawnoff shotgun
and a crowbar, ran through the gallery, waving the firearm and
yelling "get down" and "keep back" to staff and patrons, smashed
the frame and glass, and ripped the canvas free.
</P>
<P>
Police suspected that the heist of the painting in less than
four minutes was "a well-executed hit by a professional who would
spirit it overseas for black-market art dealers."
</P>
<P>
It is reported that interpol has been notified of the theft.
</P>
<P>
The painting was gifted to the gallery in 1921 by Viscount
Leverhulme.
</P>
<P>
A year ago, a Colin McCahon mural valued at 1.25 million NZ
dollars (about 630,000 U.S. dollars) was stolen from a
Conservation Department visitor center at Lake Waikaremoana on New
Zealand's North Island.
