<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Vs. Yen, Down Vs. Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose slightly against the Japanese  
yen, edging back from its lowest levels of the year. The dollar 
fell against the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 109.11 Japanese yen in late New York  
trading, up from 109.05 late Wednesday. It last traded that low on 
Jan. 11, when it closed at 108.22 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's meager gain against the yen came after a declining  
trend that had raised concerns that Japanese financial authorities 
might step into the market to push the dollar higher. An overly 
high yen could threaten Japan's struggling economy by making that 
country's exports less competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.0686, up from $1.0594 late Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4936 Swiss francs, down from  
1.5127, and 1.4952 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4896. The British 
pound rose to $1.6067 from $1.6062. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8301 German 
marks, down from 1.8453; 6.1379 French francs, down from 6.1889; 
and 1,812 Italian lire, down from 1,828.

<HEADLINE> Willie Stargell Hospitalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Hall of Famer Willie Stargell is undergoing  
treatment for an undisclosed serious health problem with one of his 
organs. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh Pirates officials have refused comment about  
Stargell, one their greatest players ever and an assistant to 
general manager Cam Bonifay. 
</P>
<P>
	But former teammates and friends have become increasingly  
concerned about the 58-year-old Stargell, who has had health 
problems for about 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Stargell was admitted to a Pittsburgh hospital under an assumed  
name for tests about three weeks ago, according to three sources 
close to the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
	During his hospital stay, the former Pirates star underwent  
blood tests and dialysis, a source said, speaking on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources did not disclose Stargell's specific ailment. But a  
former teammate, who did not want to be identified, said Stargell 
has undergone kidney dialysis for several years. 
</P>
<P>
	Stargell was moved recently from the Pittsburgh hospital to  
another medical care facility to undergo additional treatment and 
care, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately known if Stargell was still in the  
Pittsburgh area or had been moved to a facility near his home in 
Wilmington, N.C., where he lives with his wife, Margaret. 
</P>
<P>
	Pirates managing general partner Kevin McClatchy, who hired  
Stargell in 1997, has ordered team officials not to comment about 
Stargell. 
</P>
<P>
	Stargell has not been seen in the owner's box at Three Rivers  
Stadium, where he often watched games, for about a month. But such 
absences were not uncommon as Stargell often left town to watch 
minor league games, attend baseball card shows to sign autographs 
or to return to his home. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the sources said Stargell first began having health  
problems after his weight increased significantly following his 
retirement in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after rejoining former Pirates manager Chuck Tanner's  
coaching staff in Atlanta in 1986, he sought medical treatment for 
a heart condition -- apparently, an irregular heartbeat -- and was 
ordered to lose weight, one of the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stargell later dropped a considerable amount of weight, and  
looked to be at nearly his playing weight when he returned to the 
Pirates in February 1997 at McClatchy's request. 
</P>
<P>
	But Stargell put on weight after rejoining the Pirates, and team  
officials have known for months he had health problems. Unable to 
stand for long stretches, he usually sat on the dugout bench to 
watch batting practice, often shooing away anyone who blocked his 
view. 
</P>
<P>
	While in the dugout, Stargell sought out former teammates and  
friends for conversation and willingly gave interviews, even though 
his speech had slowed noticeably in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates have tried to deflect questions about Stargell's  
health, but team officials have received calls recently from former 
teammates and friends inquiring about his condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is one of the greatest team leaders ever in sports,''  
Tanner said recently when interviewed about the 1979 World Series 
champion Pirates. ``He lifted that team up and carried it to the 
World Series. Any time you needed a big hit that season, Willie 
gave it to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stargell hit 32 homers in 1979, several years after it was  
generally believed his career was winding down. He also hit 48 
homers for the 1971 World Series champion Pirates -- the most by any 
Pirates player in the last 49 years -- but was overshadowed in the 
World Series by Hall of Fame teammate Roberto Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
	Stargell played for the Pirates from 1962-82, batting .282 with  
475 homers -- he had seven more in the postseason -- and 1,540 RBIs. 
He is the Pirates' career leader in home runs, RBIs and extra-base 
hits (953). 
</P>
<P>
	Known as ``Pops'' while leading the 1979 ``We Are Family''  
Pirates, he shared the National League MVP award that year with 
Keith Hernandez of St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Stargell also was the MVP of the NL playoffs and World Series  
and is the only player to win all three awards in the same season. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, Stargell became the 200th member of the Hall of Fame  
and the 17th elected in his first year of induction. He later 
became the Braves' special assistant to the director of player 
personnel, a title he held until returning to Pittsburgh.

<HEADLINE> Internet's 30th Birthday Celebrated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The computer scientists who pioneered the  
Internet and entrepreneurs who are profiting from it celebrated the 
30th anniversary Thursday of the global network's first primitive 
connection. 
</P>
<P>
	Three decades ago, on Sept. 2, 1969, a small crowd gathered  
inside professor Len Kleinrock's lab at the University of 
California, Los Angeles, where two bulky computers with flashing 
white lights were linked by a 15-foot cable. Silently, meaningless 
bits of information flowed between the computers. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a test of the technology that remains the foundation of  
the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``In those early days, Len Kleinrock and his colleagues couldn't  
possibly have foreseen that they were on the ground floor of one of 
the most life-altering innovations of this century,'' UCLA 
Chancellor Albert Carnesale said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the anniversary celebration did not focus on the past. It  
was the future that researchers and business people spoke about. 
</P>
<P>
	As it progresses, the Internet will rely less on wires and more  
on the airwaves, said Robert Kahn, president of the Corporation for 
National Research Initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people don't want to be connected to their desktops,'' he  
said. ``They want to be able to move around and have access to all 
that information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an exciting time to be alive,'' said Kleinrock, still  
a UCLA computer science professor. ``We're just beginning to move 
out of the stone age of the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some company officials suggested that in the future the Internet  
should become an invisible force, something that works behind the 
scenes to carry information to people. 
</P>
<P>
	``A user does not understand what is happening behind the  
computer screen,'' said George Vradenburg III, senior vice 
president of global and strategic policy for America Online Inc. 
``The future is in the art of making it disappear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty years ago, hardly anybody outside Kleinrock's lab noticed  
when the first network test succeeded. The project grew from the 
needs of the Defense Department's Advance Research Projects Agency, 
which was formed after the Soviet Union's 1957 launch of Sputnik, 
the first manmade satellite to orbit the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials wanted a fast and efficient way of sharing information  
between research centers. The network needed to be decentralized so 
that that one failure would not kill the system. And the computers 
needed to speak a common language of data chopped into packets, 
each labeled with instructions on where to go and how to be 
reassembled. 
</P>
<P>
	Kleinrock pioneered the technology, later known as packet  
switching, as a graduate student at Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology. He wrote the first paper on the subject in 1961. He 
became a professor at UCLA in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1969, ARPA chose his lab for the first test communication  
between a host computer and an Interface Message Processor. The IMP 
would act as a translator between the local computers and the 
network. 
</P>
<P>
	After the first test, the network quickly grew. By the end of  
1969, four sites had been connected: UCLA, the Stanford Research 
Institute, UC Santa Barbara and the University of Utah. The number 
increased to 10 within seven months. 
</P>
<P>
	Applications like e-mail and file transfer utilities emerged in  
subsequent years, but it was not until the late 1980s, when the 
World Wide Web appeared, the network became a force not only in 
research but also in commerce and culture. 
</P>
<P>
	The refrigerator-size IMP was decommissioned in the 1980s. It  
made a rare public appearance outside the 30th anniversary 
conference, its rows of lights dark and its battleship gray case 
opened, exposing wires, fans and other components.

<HEADLINE> Editorial Roundup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Here are excerpts from editorials in newspapers in the United  
States and abroad: 

</P>
<P>
	Sept. 1  
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times, on Million Youth March:  
</P>
<P>
	The Federal District Court in New York ruled properly yesterday  
that the city's attempt to prevent the so-called Million Youth 
March violated the constitutional right to free speech. Instead of 
appealing to a higher court, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani needs to issue 
the necessary permits and concentrate on making this a safe and 
orderly gathering. To escalate the public statements and the legal 
battle would only inflame racial tensions -- and provide the 
archbigot Khallid Abdul Muhammad with free publicity and a wider 
audience. ... 

</P>
<P>
	Aug. 25  
</P>
<P>
	South County Journal, Kent, Wash., on Ken Starr:  
</P>
<P>
	Ken Starr wants to leave the independent counsel's post and has  
told a three-judge panel that he plans to leave before the end of 
the year. Given the thankless nature of the job, who can blame him? 
</P>
<P>
	However, Starr ... should stay on to see his work through to  
completion. After all, this investigation is hardly ordinary. It 
resulted in the impeachment of the president and his near-removal 
from office. 
</P>
<P>
	We could understand Starr's point if there were only loose ends  
left and subordinates could wrap up the loose ends and edit the 
final report. But Starr won't say if that's the case and has 
declined to tell the three-judge panel what, if any, significant 
prosecutions remain. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr has said that he expected the investigation and the final  
report to be done by November 2000. We would hope it is a lot 
sooner than that. It would be better if it ended before the end of 
this year. ... 

</P>
<P>
	Aug. 30  
</P>
<P>
	Press-Journal, Vero Beach, Fla., on Warren Beatty's presidential  
quest: 
</P>
<P>
	Warren Beatty, best known to date for his moviemaking, is  
hinting that he may become a presidential candidate, and without 
having first obtained the sort of credential that Hollywood's 
Ronald Reagan took time to garner: an eight-year stint as 
California governor. 
</P>
<P>
	This is an era when anybody runs for president, sometimes just  
to espouse some ideal or policy while also hoping, no doubt, that 
lightning will strike. So, despite many, many jokes, why not 
Beatty? ... 

</P>
<P>
	Aug. 31  
</P>
<P>
	Las Cruces (N.M.) Sun-News, on offering clemency to terrorists:  
</P>
<P>
	Why would anyone be given clemency after being convicted of  
terrorism, especially a group of terrorists? 
</P>
<P>
	The one sure message that should be sent in this country is that  
the penalties for those found guilty of terrorism will be harsh and 
that the full term of their sentences should be carried out. 
Otherwise, the wrong message is being sent. 
</P>
<P>
	That, unfortunately, is what President Clinton is doing by  
offering conditional clemency to 16 members of a Puerto Rican 
terrorist group known as the Armed Forces for National Liberation 
(FALN), an organization behind 130 bomb attacks on civilian and 
military targets from 1974 to 1983. Those attacks, according to an 
Associated Press report, killed six people and wounded dozens. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The widely talked about suspicion is that Clinton is taking this  
questionable action because Puerto Rican leaders in New York want 
it, and as a result it might help his wife Hillary with Puerto 
Rican voters in her planned run for the U.S. Senate from New York. 
The timing of all this certainly leads to that perception. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The terrorists should serve out their full sentences as a  
message to others of their ilk. 

</P>
<P>
	Aug. 30  
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Globe, on demise of Mir:  
</P>
<P>
	For a space station plagued with problems, Russia's Mir has run  
up a respectable record that ended Saturday with the return of its 
last regular crew to earth. Mir's fate, to be settled next year 
when it is incinerated while plunging into the atmosphere above the 
Pacific Ocean, will be merely the mechanical aftermath of a major 
human achievement. 
</P>
<P>
	Mir, launched more than 13 years ago, was expected to serve for  
five years. Its impressive longevity had its counterparts in the 
prolonged space duty of some of its crew members, including one who 
all told spent more than a year on Mir. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Mir added enormously to the store of knowledge about prolonged  
space flight, which will be critical to the next big undertaking -- 
the international space station in which Russian, American, and 
other participants will work closely together. ... 

</P>
<P>
	Sept. 1  
</P>
<P>
	The State, Columbia, S.C., on protecting state's habitat:  
</P>
<P>
	Looking forward to the new millennium, the board of the state  
Natural Resources Department took a welcome step ... by voting 
unanimously to make habitat protection its top priority. This means 
that DNR, which owns and manages 159,262 acres of unspoiled, 
natural areas at about 140 sites around the state, will be focusing 
on protecting that and other land from development. ... 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, DNR's focus has been mainly on making sure its land  
is managed properly for hunters and people who fish. The agency 
does this with a $65 million budget and 1,000 employees. ... 
</P>
<P>
	DNR's new priority is a sign of commitment to the environment by  
Gov. Jim Hodges, who appointed a new board earlier this year. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution is only a first step. DNR says it will be  
developing an inventory of its sensitive lands, making plans to 
acquire more lands and creating public-private partnerships to 
preserve land. Right now, however, those plans are only 
well-meaning wishes. Unless DNR devotes staff power, time, energy 
and money to this priority, the resolution won't be worth the paper 
it is written on. 

</P>
<P>
	Aug. 29  
</P>
<P>
	Akron (Ohio) Beacon Journal, on Attorney General Janet Reno:  
</P>
<P>
	There's more that should concern Janet Reno than her own  
credibility. The attorney general should be worried about public 
confidence in the country's top investigative agency. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of the fire at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco,  
Texas, on April 19, 1993, officials of the Justice Department and 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation denied any role in the fire 
that killed 80 members of the cult. They insisted that no 
pyrotechnic tear-gas canisters had been used during the FBI assault 
that aimed to end the 51-day standoff at the compound. 
</P>
<P>
	Disclosures last week from an FBI inventory of weapons used that  
day indicate, however, that agents, in fact, had used pyrotechnic 
tear-gas canisters at the compound. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency's explanation of the contradiction is that the  
canisters had been used six hours before at a bunker 100 yards away 
from the main building where the fire started. That may, indeed, be 
the truth, but what reason would anyone have now, after six years 
of denials, to trust the word of the bureau or the Justice 
Department? 
</P>
<P>
	Reno announced in 1993 that the buck stopped with her. If there  
is a time to order a truly thorough and independent investigation, 
this is it. 

</P>
<P>
	Aug. 27  
</P>
<P>
	The Intelligencer, Wheeling, W.Va., on the Superfund:  
</P>
<P>
	Talk about toxic waste: How about hundreds of millions of  
dollars a year fed into a cesspool of attorneys and bureaucrats 
rather than into the environmental clean-up work for which the 
money was intended? That's the federal government's ``Superfund'' 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of ``Superfund,'' noting that it has been in existence  
for nearly a generation but has managed to clean up fewer than 200 
sites where toxic waste was discovered, say it's time to tear the 
program apart and start all over. 
</P>
<P>
	According to estimates by the General Accounting Office, less  
than half of the $1.5 billion a year spent by ``Superfund'' 
actually goes to clean up toxic waste sites. Most of the money goes 
for ``support'' functions such as lawyers and other administrative 
functions. Meanwhile, more than 1,200 waste sites throughout the 
country remain to be cleaned up. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``Superfund'' can't even do a quick, inexpensive, effective  
cleanup job on a toxic waste site, much less on itself. Congress 
should step in and chuck ``Superfund'' into a garbage can, then 
draft a new law that may give Americans some reason to have 
confidence that their government isn't wasting their money.

<P>
	The Sun, London, on anniversary of death of Princess Diana:  
</P>
<P>
	It is two years to the day since Diana died. Yet flowers and  
tributes laid outside the gates of her London home show the people 
still mourn the People's Princess. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of us will take time out today to remember a remarkable  
woman, and how she touched so many lives for the better. 
</P>
<P>
	Then we wish for three things:  
</P>
<P>
	That the official report into her death dispels forever wild  
conspiracy theories. 
</P>
<P>
	That the Diana fund starts to pay out for good causes some of  
the millions collected. 
</P>
<P>
	And that rats like James Hewitt put the welfare of her sons  
before their money-grubbing. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, finally, Diana may be able to truly rest in peace.  

</P>
<P>
	Sept. 1  
</P>
<P>
	Daily Telegraph, London, on anniversary of death of Princess  
Diana: 
</P>
<P>
	Two years on from the sudden death of Diana, the Princess of  
Wales, there is plainly a public feeling that somewhere soon there 
should be a permanent memorial to her. ... It might help to get 
things moving in accordance with public wishes if certain 
misconceptions were removed. The royal family does not erect 
statues to themselves or anyone else. To lay blame in that quarter 
for failure to get anything moving, as certain protagonists for a 
memorial have been doing, is there wholly to misrepresent the 
position. Nor is it right to assert that the absence of a memorial 
means that Diana has been ``shamefully forgotten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course the mourning of two years ago has diminished;  
mercifully, the passage of time does relieve nearly all 
bereavements. It does not follow that people have been forgotten. 
There will, furthermore, always be people who are critical of the 
princess and regard tributes to her as tantamount to disloyalty to 
the monarchy. That certainly should not stand in the way of 
devising the sort of permanent memorial that most of the public 
would like to see. ... 

</P>
<P>
	Aug. 31  
</P>
<P>
	Corriere della Sera, Rome, on English reaction to anniversary of  
death of Princess Diana: 
</P>
<P>
	Few flowers, a half-empty museum, unsold souvenirs. No flag at  
half mast, no commemoration. Listless recollections in the 
newspapers. The anniversary of the disappearance of the Princess of 
Wales is a weary one. 
</P>
<P>
	When she left two years ago, we all thought she was only moving  
from a tunnel in Paris to the heavens of the great myths, where 
Marilyn Monroe, James Dean, and John Lennon were waiting for her. 
That wasn't the case: In a short time, the myth of Diana seems to 
have evaporated. ... 
</P>
<P>
	What happened? Two things, probably.  
</P>
<P>
	The first is obvious. She wasn't a diva of cinema or a rock  
star. She was Queen of the news, and the news is a furnace that 
burns and leaves nothing.

	However, something else happened. Remember the day of Diana's  
funeral. There was nothing English about it. There were tears and 
wailing, gifts and flowers, regrets and promises. ... 
</P>
<P>
	There is a melancholy consistency in the way the English are  
forgetting Diana. They were a race of cold blood and long memories. 
They are becoming a people of warm blood and short-lived memories. 
Welcome to Europe, we might say.

	The Australian, Sydney, on East Timor's independence ballot:  
</P>
<P>
	The relief that yesterday's poll passed relatively peacefully  
does not mean an end to anxiety in East Timor. The votes have yet 
to be counted. Presumably, the general population will have some 
idea, before the official result is announced, of the result. The 
high turnout of voters and relative calm of the poll suggest that 
the result may well be rejection of the proposal for autonomy 
within Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the result, there has always been a possibility of  
post-poll violence, fueled by the anger of the disappointed 
factions and the possibility of victors' retribution. Before the 
poll, the performance of the Indonesian military and police in 
meeting their responsibility for maintaining law and order was 
seriously deficient, and improved only after severe international 
criticism. After the poll, Indonesia's responsibility for keeping 
the peace remains. If, as seems likely, the vote is for 
independence, the responsibility on Indonesia will be even greater.

	Yediot Ahronot daily, Tel Aviv, Israel, on efforts to stop  
terrorism: 
</P>
<P>
	Yesterday, all kinds of strange leaks attributed to the prime  
minister's office surfaced, saying that if it became clear that the 
murder (of an Israeli couple on the border of Israel and the West 
Bank over the weekend) was politically motivated, the signing 
ceremony for the Israeli-Palestinian agreement, if an agreement is 
reached, would be postponed. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if it becomes clear that the killing was a terrorist act  
committed by opponents of the peace process, we cannot allow an act 
like this to obstruct the negotiations for peace and reconciliation 
between the two nations. 
</P>
<P>
	We need to remember that it is particularly now that ... we are  
witnessing a three-way effort among Israel, the Palestinian 
Authority and Jordan to destroy Islamic terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	The major development of the last few days is Jordan actively  
signing on (to efforts to stop militants). 
</P>
<P>
	King Abdullah demonstrated this week even stronger determination  
than his father ... and the steps he took are more forceful and 
effective than in the past.

John Paul II visiting Iraq as part of his tour to biblical sites in 
the Middle East region on the occasion of the advent of the third 
Millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the U.S. looks dimly at the prospect of the visit ... for  
fear that the Iraqi regime would exploit such a high-profile visit 
by the leader of the Roman Catholic Church. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the U.S. doesn't want the truth about the dire effects  
of sanctions on the Iraqi people, especially on their children, to 
be further documented for the whole international community to hear 
and see. How else can one explain the opposition to the visit of 
the Pope, the assistants of members of the U.S. Congress and other

	Yesterday morning, when reports came in of a 98.6 percent  
turnout in the East Timor election, and -- one tragic stabbing of a 
UN official aside -- none of the violence that has permeated life 
there for more than two decades, it seemed possible to hope that 
the calm on the streets set the standard for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	But, perhaps to no one's surprise, Monday proved a false dawn.  
...
</P>
<P>
	The atmosphere of order that prevailed on polling day suggested  
that the authorities are capable of maintaining the peace when the 
eyes of the world are on them; and while they are mindful of U.S. 
President Bill Clinton's hint that international loans might dry up 
if there was bloodshed on polling day. That pressure must be 
maintained for the foreseeable future. ...

are only too happy to believe that the rebel Congolese Rally for 
Democracy's belated formal yes to the Lusaka cease-fire agreement 
is an important step on the road to a lasting peace in Congo; that 
it will see an end to the civil war there which threatens to burn 
the whole of central Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	A glance at the reality and at events in Congo will serve to  
subdue the high expectations. Signatures alone do not create peace, 
as has been proved by the latest fighting between troops from 
Uganda and Rwanda -- both signatories to the Lusaka agreement in 
July. ...

</P>
<P>
	Asahi Shimbun, Tokyo, on North Korea:  
</P>
<P>
	We should not lose sight of the fact that North Korea's  
continued missile development increases tension in relations 
between North Korea and the United States as well as the situation 
in the Korean Peninsula, and increases the possibility of an 
escalated arms race in East Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea is trying to earn hard currency by exporting its  
missiles to get over its economic crisis and its food shortages, 
and hopes to extract aid from the United States using the missile 
development and suspected nuclear development as leverage. North 
Korea's approach is a form of brinkmanship with the goal of 
preserving the present political regime. 
</P>
<P>
	Without some change in North Korea's posture, there can be no  
hope of a genuine solution to the missile problem. We must consider 
how to encourage and hasten, in cooperation with the international 
community, needed changes in North Korea's policy.

<HEADLINE> Forest Service Settles Tree Paint Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A worker advocacy group says it has settled a  
suit against the U.S. Forest Service over the past use of oil-based 
paint that workers had blamed for giving them flu-like symptoms and 
placing them at greater risk of miscarriages. 
</P>
<P>
	The Forest Service has agreed to use water-based paint for tree  
marking -- not oil-based paint -- for the next three years under the 
settlement, according to the Forest Service Employees for 
Environmental Ethics, which had sued the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency also agreed to give the Eugene, Ore.-based group  
specifications of the water-based paint when they become available 
and promised to advise the group in advance of any change in paint 
specifications in the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Forest Service also agreed to pay $5,000 for covering legal  
costs to the group, which includes 500 Forest Service employees and 
13,000 other members. 
</P>
<P>
	Forest Service officials did not return telephone calls  
requesting a comment on the settlement announced by the advocacy 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal health study completed last year concluded that  
hundreds of female employees at the Forest Service who worked with 
herbicides or special paint used to mark trees for logging were at 
an increased risk of miscarriage. 
</P>
<P>
	But the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health  
study stopped short of blaming the paint for miscarriages or other 
health problems.

<HEADLINE> Religion Today  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANDOVER, Md. (AP) -- The crowd is on its feet, stage lights  
swirl overhead and the young singer leaps across the stage 
chanting, ``Have the people had enough?'' 
</P>
<P>
	They haven't; the audience screams its approval.  
</P>
<P>
	If this sounds like a rock concert, it's actually a special  
service at the 10,000-seat Jericho City of Praise church in this 
Washington, D.C. suburb, one of several mammoth churches throughout 
the country to embrace professional musicians and artists as one 
way to lure people wary of the traditional tones of organized 
religion. 
</P>
<P>
	On a recent Saturday night at Jericho, more than 10,000 people  
waited nearly three hours in the summer heat for a gospel concert. 
Thousands more were turned away. 
</P>
<P>
	Once inside, the crowd seldom sat down as artists performed with  
a backdrop of stage smoke, bright lights and choirs. 
</P>
<P>
	More and more churches are sponsoring concerts, hiring musicians  
for Sunday services and even placing some artists on staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``They recognize this is one of the ways they not only minister  
to their flock spiritually but also to their entertainment needs,'' 
said Frank Breedon, president of the Nashville-based Gospel Music 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	With the swelling popularity of gospel and Christian music,  
dozens of congregations have evolved into ``megachurches'' with 
thousands of members. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a lifestyle marketing approach that these churches  
have gone to,'' Breedon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Anderson, program director at the Washington gospel music  
radio station WPGC-AM, has also seen a trend of churches ``having 
recording artists as ministers of music.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You know the person is committed to the church, but they are  
also committed to their music ministry,'' Anderson said. ``You're 
getting top quality, and that in itself tends to generate 
excitement amongst parishioners ... .'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Washington area, award-winning Gospocentric artist Byron  
Cage heads the music ministry at Ebenezer AME Church in Fort 
Washington, Md. Verity Records' Richard Smallwood, a Grammy award 
winner and composer, is at Metropolitan Baptist Church in downtown 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	At West Angeles Church of God in Christ in Los Angeles, artist  
Kurt Carr is the creative director. 
</P>
<P>
	Before climbing the charts to musical stardom, Grammy winner  
Kirk Franklin, who is credited with taking gospel music from its 
traditional tones to a more hip-hop sound, was the music minister 
at a Texas church. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Recording Industry Association of America,  
gospel music sales grew 40 percent last year. ``Gospel is now 
larger than jazz, classical and New Age combined,'' Breedon said. 
</P>
<P>
	But gospel is not the only hot music in churches.  
</P>
<P>
	In Houston, the 25,000-member Second Baptist Church serves as  
home to Caedmon's Call, a seven-member Christian rock band. 
Parishioners are treated to the group's sounds every Sunday night 
as the band leads the services. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think us being there has definitely helped with the  
growth,'' said vocalist and guitarist Cliff Young, whose father, 
the Rev. Ed Young, is pastor of Second Baptist. 
</P>
<P>
	Several years ago the elder Young began an artist-in-residence  
program at the church for professional touring musicians. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'd say, 'Play in service whenever you're in town and we'll  
help you,' '' Cliff Young recalled. ``My dad has always been 
supportive of musicians. A lot of churches were not into that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cage, one of the artists performing at the recent Jericho  
service and the minister for church worship and music 
administration at the 12,000-member Ebenezer AME Church, said 
having professional artists in service can contribute something 
special. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Earth belongs to the Lord,'' he said, ``why can't we  
use strobe lights?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Having professional performers ``creates an excitement. They  
(parishioners) don't know what to expect,'' said Cage, whose staff 
at Ebenezer includes two other recorded gospel artists, Patrick 
Lundy and Stephen Hurd. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent Ebenezer services have featured such performers as Bebe  
Winans, Yolanda Adams, Karen Clark-Sheard and Dottie Peoples. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'll travel all over the country the other six days of the  
week, but on Sunday morning they're at their church in place and 
ready to minister,'' Anderson said of such artists. 
</P>
<P>
	And parishioners seem to appreciate their efforts. Said Cage:  
``Those people who never came to church before are flocking now.''

<HEADLINE>  Maryland Teen Admits To Strangling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- Unflinching and stone-faced, a Maryland  
teen-ager told an Israeli court today that he strangled an 
acquaintance with a rope in the United States in 1997, then 
dismembered and burned the body. 
</P>
<P>
	Samuel Sheinbein's confession came as part of a plea bargain  
under which he will serve 24 years in an Israeli prison. The deal 
was leaked last month by angry U.S. prosecutors who felt the 
sentence was too lenient. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheinbein, 19, fled to Israel shortly after the killing of  
Alfredo Tello Jr. in September 1997 and successfully fought 
extradition. The case strained relations between Israel and the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Sheinbein stared ahead as Tel Aviv District Court Judge  
Uri Oren read from the indictment, which said Tello was killed by 
Sheinbein and an accomplice, Aaron Needle, who hanged himself in a 
U.S. jail while awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``The accused and Needle brutally attacked Tello by strangling  
him with a rope around his neck and hitting him with a blunt 
instrument to the head several times,'' the judge read from the 
indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	Turning to the defendant, Oren asked whether this was true.  
Sheinbein, showing no emotion, stood up and answered ``ken,'' using 
the Hebrew word for yes. The proceedings were in Hebrew, but were 
translated into English for Sheinbein. 
</P>
<P>
	Oren then convicted Sheinbein of premeditated murder.  
</P>
<P>
	Under the plea bargain, which must be formally approved in an  
Oct. 11 court session, Sheinbein would be eligible for parole after 
16 years, likely including the two years he has already spent in 
custody in Israel. He would also be eligible for weekend furloughs 
after six years. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheinbein fled to Israel shortly after Tello's body was found in  
an empty garage near Sheinbein's home in Aspen Hill, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Claiming Israeli citizenship through his father, the U.S.-born  
Sheinbein successfully blocked his return to the United States, 
seeking refuge under a law that bars the extradition of Israeli 
citizens for trial abroad. Sheinbein had little connection to 
Israel, except for a few visits as a child. 
</P>
<P>
	The killing and Sheinbein's flight raised a furor among  
Maryland's Hispanic organizations and Latino community. U.S. 
authorities expressed anger at Sheinbein's manipulation of the 
system, and some U.S. lawmakers threatened to cut aid to Israel if 
Sheinbein was not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel's Justice Ministry fought all the way to the Supreme  
Court to get Sheinbein extradited, but the court upheld Sheinbein's 
citizenship and set the stage for the trial to take place in 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheinbein initially entered a not guilty plea, and the attorney  
general's staff -- seeking to avoid a lengthy, costly trial -- began 
negotiating a plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli prosecutors initially defended the deal by saying a  
24-year sentence is the longest that can be imposed in Israel on a 
minor. At the time of the killing, Sheinbein was 17. 
</P>
<P>
	However, lawyers in the case said today that Sheinbein was  
already an adult when he was indicted and could have faced life in 
prison, though such a sentence is rarely imposed in criminal murder 
cases in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	In Maryland, the prosecutor who would have had jurisdiction over  
the case called it ``a miscarriage of justice'' that Sheinbein was 
punished in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomery County state's attorney Doug Gansler said he had  
spoken with the Tello family last week. He described the family as 
``resigned, frustrated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a long legal process that they do not understand and  
are not going to understand -- because there is no understanding 
it,'' Gansler said. ``If you look at it from a global view, what 
seems right, what seems wrong, it's wrong. It's a miscarriage of 
justice. He should have been tried here.''

<HEADLINE> Telecom Italia To Cut 13.000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Italian phone giant Telecom Italia SpA today  
announced plans to eliminate 13,000 jobs and reduce overall costs 
by $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberto Colaninno, who was named Telecom's chairman and chief  
executive officer following the company's hostile takeover by 
Olivetti SpA in May, said the cuts were part of long-term 
restructuring plans. Colaninno is also head of Olivetti, which 
controls 52.1 percent of Telecom. 
</P>
<P>
	A former monopoly, Telecom has struggled since its privatization  
in October 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Colaninno said at a news conference that 9,000 of the 13,000  
jobs to be cut over the next two years will be through retirements, 
with others coming through layoffs. Most of the job cuts are to 
come in the company's fixed-line operations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Colaninno said the company planned to hire workers for  
its booming cellular phone business, Telecom Italia Mobile SpA, or 
TIM, Italy's largest mobile phone operator. Telecom has a 60 
percent stake in TIM. 
</P>
<P>
	Cellular phones are so popular in Italy that they have recently  
surpassed the number of fixed-line phones in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Other objectives for Telecom include developing its Internet and  
data operations, seeking pan-European alliances for its mobile 
phone operations and restructuring its fixed-line business, 
Colaninno said. The company also plans to sell its non-core assets 
and reduce debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Colaninno also said Telecom planned to slash costs by $2.5  
billion by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am confident we will achieve (these objectives) quite  
reasonably,'' Colaninno said.

	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A suburban school district is being challenged  
in federal court for suspending classes for the Jewish holidays of 
Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit in U.S.  
District Court against Sycamore School District, saying it favored 
Judaism over other religious faiths. 
</P>
<P>
	Gino Scarselli, associate legal director for the ACLU of Ohio,  
said public schools may close on religious holidays only if they 
have a nonreligious reason for doing so. 
</P>
<P>
	The school district had observed the policy of no tests and no  
new material on Jewish holidays because about 15 percent of the 
children were absent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quite frankly what we were doing was not working,''  
Superintendent Bruce Armstrong said. ``It was not in the kids' best 
educational interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So he recommended that the schools be closed and the school  
calendar rearranged to ensure the required 178 class days. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACLU lawsuit ignores this year's closings but asks that the  
district be prohibited from taking future actions that favor one 
religious denomination over any other. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no interest in promoting any religion in the  
schools,'' Armstrong said.

 *Enthronement ceremony for Demetrios    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Archbishop Demetrios will be formally enthroned  
Sept. 18 as the leader of the 1.9 million Greek Orthodox in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Demetrios was named in August to succeed Archbishop Spyridon,  
who resigned after a brief reign troubled by severe acrimony over 
his leadership. Both were appointed by Ecumenical Patriarch 
Bartholomew of Istanbul, the leader of some 200 million Eastern 
Orthodox worldwide. 
</P>

 *Catholic college gets Muslim chaplain    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Georgetown University, the nation's oldest  
Catholic campus, has named its first Muslim chaplain. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahya Hendi, a doctoral candidate in comparative religion at  
Temple University, is to lead worship and provide counsel for 
Muslim students and staff. He also will advise the university on 
Islamic issues and practices. 
</P>
<P>
	His selection was announced by the Rev. Adam Bunnell, a Catholic  
priest and Georgetown's chief chaplain. Hendi said his selection is 
a milestone in the ``growing responsiveness to Muslim communities 
on campus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He previously was a chaplain at the National Naval Medical  
Center and the National Institutes of Health, and an imam in 
Charlotte, N.C. He has a bachelor's degree in Islamic law from the 
University of Jordan and a master's degree in comparative religion 
from Hartford (Conn.) Seminary.

 *Americans relax about Muslim dress    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Council on American-Islamic Relations says  
there appears to be increased tolerance in America of Muslim 
women's modest attire. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, observant women challenged for the way they dressed  
accounted for most of the council's civil rights complaints in the 
religious category. 
</P>
<P>
	A year later, according to the third annual report, the majority  
of religious complaints were lack of time to observe daily prayers. 
The council noted a slight improvement among employers, but few 
public schools have policies allowing students time off to pray. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, there were 285 religious complaints, nearly equal to  
the previous report. The majority, 80 percent, came from the 14 
states and the District of Columbia, where Muslim population is 
concentrated.

smuggle them abroad.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Says Don't Aid Bad Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate George W.  
Bush said Thursday that federal funds should be confiscated from 
the worst-performing schools and made available to parents for 
private education, tutoring or ``whatever offers hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In my administration, federal money will no longer follow  
failure,'' the Texas governor told the Latin Business Association, 
a Hispanic group. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Bush's plan, every school getting the Title I money would  
be required to test its impoverished students on basic academics 
each year. A warning would be issued to schools that fail to make 
progress toward state standards. After three years of no progress, 
the Title I money would be matched with other federal education 
money and given to the state, which would set up an education 
account -- about $1,500 a year -- for each affected student. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents could choose how to spend the money. They could keep  
the money and their child in the original school or opt for an 
alternative, including private school and tutoring -- ``for whatever 
offers hope,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government currently spends $7.7 billion on Title I to help  
educate poor children. 
</P>
<P>
	A Bush aide said the plan would require states to create  
mechanisms for ensuring parents spend the money on education. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said federal programs affecting teacher training,  
curriculum research and school safety would have to prove results. 
Those that didn't would be stripped of their funding. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also proposed shifting the $4.4 billion Head Start program  
from the Department of Health and Human Services to the Education 
Department, a step he said would return the program's focus to 
preparing disadvantaged preschoolers for the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Invoking the buzzwords often heard in school-reform efforts in  
California, Texas and many other states, Bush said schools must 
establish clear goals that help measure students' basic skills. 
Testing helps ensure they achieve them, he said. And someone must 
take responsibility when they fail, he said, singling out 
principals. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, he said, local control of schools is essential  
to meeting the goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Education Secretary Richard Riley said he saw similarities  
between Bush's Title I proposal and those of his brother Jeb, who 
as Florida's governor pushed through the nation's first statewide 
voucher plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter how you dress it up, how long you delay it, or what  
you call it, a voucher is a voucher,'' Riley said. ``Gov. George W. 
Bush would have us start down the road of accountability, then take 
a dangerous detour into vouchers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We would be against a plan like this,'' said Reginald Felton,  
director of federal relations for the National School Boards 
Association. ``The objective is to raise the academic achievement 
of all students.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But at a Title I elementary school Bush visited Thursday, the  
idea of vouchers won cautious support from two teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is a good idea, because sometimes private schools  
have a lot more to offer -- more personal, smaller classes,'' said 
teacher Joann Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	She and fellow teacher Janet Leinin didn't believe that such  
programs would rob Bennett-Kew Elementary School of students and 
the public money that follows them, because, they said, it is 
academically one of the strongest in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his GOP presidential opponents, Ken Blackwell, national  
chairman of Steve Forbes' campaign, said Bush didn't go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think his program is a bit weak in one particular area -- he  
tells parents to wait three years for real school reform,'' said 
Blackwell, who is also secretary of state in Ohio, a state that is 
experimenting with vouchers. ``I don't believe and neither does 
Steve Forbes that we can wait three years for real school reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole's spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said, ``I thought it  
was more notable for what was not in it than for what was in it.'' 
He cited the discipline issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole favors school vouchers, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley, campaigning in  
Ohio said vouchers are not the answer to the problems of public 
education. ``I think that there are problems -- not the least of 
which are issues of church and state -- and ultimately they will 
have to be resolved,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As a senator from New Jersey, Bradley said he voted twice for  
federally funded voucher experiments. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush delivered his remarks in a state where voters have soundly  
rejected proposals to allow public money for private schools, an 
arrangement often referred to as school vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, Bush has backed a proposed pilot program for  
taxpayer-funded vouchers for private school tuition. State 
lawmakers have declined to pass the proposal ever since Bush became 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month a federal judge halted a voucher program in Ohio,  
saying it appeared to have the ``primary effect of advancing 
religion'' because it allowed public money to be used for religious 
and other private schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge later said the program can remain in place for  
students who participated in the program last year, but said that 
would last only one semester or until a final judgment is reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush offered a forceful defense of such programs.  
</P>
<P>
	``All monopolies are slow to reform when consumers have no power  
to express their frustration,'' he said. ``In education, parents 
who have options have influence.''

<HEADLINE> Long-Term Treasury Bonds Fall / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices dropped for a sixth session in a row  
Thursday amid growing investor concerns that the Federal Reserve 
may again raise interest rates to keep the U.S. economy from 
overheating. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher interest rates lower the value of fixed-rate securities,  
such as bonds, that already are in circulation. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 21/32  
point, or by $6.56 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, rose to 6.13 percent from 6.08 percent 
late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Spurring the selloff was a string of government reports that  
suggested persistently strong growth in the economy and potential 
inflation pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported that the cost of labor surged at  
an annual rate of 4.5 percent in the second quarter, the biggest 
increase in nearly five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department also said the number of Americans filing  
new claims for unemployment benefits last week rose by just 4,000 
to 289,000. Economists consider jobless claims level below 300,000 
an indication of an extremely tight labor market. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the Commerce Department said orders to factories  
rose a strong 2.1 percent in July, the biggest increase this year, 
following a 0.8 percent gain in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets, already nervous about August unemployment  
figures due out Friday, were rattled by the developments. Many 
economists expect the rate -- now at 4.3 percent -- will return to a 
29-year low of 4.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Worries about how inflation-fighters at the Fed might respond  
were heightened as Federal Reserve Gov. Edward Kelley was quoted by 
Market News International as saying it would be premature to assume 
the central bank will wait until next year to raise rates again. 
The Fed already has boosted rates twice this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader Treasury market, prices of short-term securities  
ranged from unchanged to 1/32 point lower, and intermediate 
maturities ranged from 1/16 point to 3/16 point lower, reported 
Bridge Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.90 percent as the  
discount fell 0.03 percentage point from Wednesday to 4.77 percent. 
Six-month yields were 5.16 percent, as the discount fell 0.03 
percentage point to 4.96 percent. One-year yields were 5.27 percent 
as the discount held steady at Wednesday's late rate of 5.00 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 5.25 percent from 5.44 percent late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 17/32 point to 113 5/8. The average yield 
to maturity rose to 5.82 percent from 5.79 percent late Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> New Kosovo Atrocity Evidence Cited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA Yugoslavia (AP) -- New evidence of past atrocities in  
Kosovo emerged Thursday with reports that 50 bodies were found 
buried in a garbage dump in the province's southwest. 
</P>
<P>
	At a field outside Ljubizda, a blue plastic tarp covered what  
appeared to be parts of rotting clothing that reeked of decomposing 
flesh. The tarp -- at the foot of one of several mounds cordoned off 
by police tape -- was anchored on all sides by heavy stones and 
piles of earth. 
</P>
<P>
	A human femur lay exposed in a nearby pit, littered with a  
child's shoe and several plastic bottles. 
</P>
<P>
	No international troops or foreign forensic experts were in  
sight. But a local farmer, saying he was repeating what he had been 
told by others, said the graves contained bodies of ethnic 
Albanians killed in April by Serb forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Serbs dug a deep hole and put Albanians in it -- men, women  
and children -- and dropped in a grenade,'' said Abedin Ademi. 
``They buried those who were killed and those who were injured even 
if they were still alive . ... Everybody knows that is how it 
happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In London, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said only that  
British troops had unearthed the bodies of 50 victims from the dump 
at Ljubizda, southwest of Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Kosovo Liberation Army leader Hashim Thaci urged an  
end to ethnic Albanian revenge attacks on Serbs and called for 
Serbs to come back to Kosovo on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are interested in establishing in Kosovo a multiethnic  
society,'' he said after meeting with Cook in London. 
</P>
<P>
	His comments were sure to be ignored by Serbs in Kosovo and  
elsewhere, who blame the KLA for anti-Serb violence since 
Milosevic's troops left in June as part of a peace agreement to end 
the NATO bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 200,000 Serbs who lived in Kosovo before the war  
have fled, amid dozens of killings, abductions and other violence 
directed at them to avenge the deaths of more than 10,000 ethnic 
Albanians during the 18-month crackdown by Milosevic's forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Reflecting continued Serb-Albanian tensions, Serbs demanding  
NATO protection and protesting the disappearance of one of their 
own blocked a main road near Gracanica, south of Pristina, on 
Thursday after roughing up six people. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbs said they erected the barricade Wednesday, a day after  
41-year-old Milorad Popovic disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO troops said Serbs beat up six people when they tried to  
drive through the village Wednesday afternoon. An ethnic Albanian 
doctor in Pristina who treated them said they were five Kosovo 
Albanians and a Bulgarian woman married to a Kosovo Albanian. 
</P>
<P>
	In other ethnic violence, NATO said a Gypsy family of four was  
found dead of gunshot wounds Wednesday in Gornji Dragolevci. Kosovo 
Albanians accuse Gypsies, or Roma, of being Serb allies. 
</P>
<P>
	A Serb man was killed and another injured in an ambush Wednesday  
near Kosovska Mitrovica, and three Serbs were injured in a grenade 
attack on their house, NATO said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Belgrade, a radical ally of Yugoslav President Slobodan  
Milosevic accused the United States of being allied with Kosovo 
Albanian ``murderers, drug traffickers and terrorists'' wreaking 
violence on Kosovo Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Serbian Premier Vojislav Seselj said Yugoslav army and  
Serb police forces who withdrew from Kosovo under the peace 
agreement should return peacefully ``as soon as possible,'' adding: 
``If there are no peaceful means available, we shall have to find 
other ways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in Pristina, KLA commander Agim Ceku said his forces  
are almost completely demilitarized, more than two weeks before the 
Sept. 19 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he said his forces would not completely disarm.  
``Disarmament and demilitarization are two completely different 
words,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The KLA is permitted to keep rifles and other small arms, but  
Ceku also has said the KLA will form Kosovo's new army -- something 
not foreseen under the peace deal.

<HEADLINE> Sears Makes Changes; Stock Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Still unable to boost its sagging sales and  
profits, Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. on Thursday warned that its 
third-quarter earnings would fall well below expectations and 
announced a shakeup in its executive ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	The news sent Sears' shares tumbling as much as 12 percent,  
making it the second biggest loser among the 30 stocks that are 
part of the Dow Jones industrial average. 
</P>
<P>
	While most retail chains have enjoyed one of their best years in  
recent history thanks to the booming economy, Sears continues to 
struggle to get its business back on track. 
</P>
<P>
	It continues to lose shoppers to the lower-priced discount  
chains such as Wal-Mart and specialty and department stores that 
offer trendy fashions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's killer competition out there in the retail business,''  
said Karen Sack, an analyst for Standard &AMP; Poor's Equity Group. 
``They've got to do something; they're coming in with very weak 
sales numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sears stock ended the day down $3.68 3/4 at $33.50 on the New York  
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The news came barely two weeks after the Hoffman Estates,  
Ill.-based company outlined a new value-focused advertising 
campaign, with the tag: ``The Good Life At A Great Price. 
Guaranteed. Sears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign was supposed to be the final piece in a series of  
changes the retailer announced early this year to turn around its 
business, including a move toward more fashionable clothing, 
remodeling its stores and selling merchandise on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	But sales at its department stores continue to be weak. The  
company announced Thursday that sales at stores open at least a 
year -- an industry gauge of performance -- rose a mere 0.1 percent 
in August. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would appear the department stores need a lot of work,''  
said Jeffrey Edelman, an analyst for Paine Webber. ``They're going 
to have to devote whatever they can to the stores.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sears also said third-quarter earnings would be in the range of  
63 cents to 67 cents per share, less than the 82 cents analysts 
expected. The retailer also said it is revising its full-year 
earnings outlook. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur C. Martinez, Sears' chairman and chief executive,  
acknowledged that the changes aren't yet working but insisted that 
they will bring tangible benefits. He said the shakeup shows the 
company's ``commitment to re-energizing our sales.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the senior management changes, Martinez will now share all  
corporate decision-making with two executives who will work with 
him in the newly created Office of the Chief Executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan J. Lacy, president of Sears Credit, will assume additional  
responsibilities as president of services. Julian C. Day, chief 
financial officer since March, was named to the new position of 
executive vice president and chief operating officer responsible 
for finance, logistics and information technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears spokeswoman Peggy Palter said the ``entire reason'' for  
the reorganization was to allow Martinez to ``focus more closely on 
the retail business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company also announced the departure of the chief of  
merchandising for its full-line department stores, Robert Mettler. 
</P>
<P>
	With Mettler's departure, two presidents have been appointed to  
cover his responsibilities. Lyle Heidemann will be president of 
hardlines, which includes appliances, hardware and consumer 
electronics. Mark Cohen will be president of softlines, which 
includes all clothing and accessories. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears has 850 full-line department stores and more than 2,100  
specialty stores. It is the second-largest retailer behind 
Wal-Mart.

	Bush Says Don't Aid Bad Schools

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate George W.  
Bush said today that federal funds should be confiscated from the 
worst-performing schools and made available to parents for private 
education, tutoring or ``whatever offers hope.'' Under the Texas 
governor's plan, every school getting the Title I money would be 
required to test its impoverished students on basic academics each

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. and Chinese officials will hold trade  
talks next week for the first time since the accidental NATO 
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. The move clears the way 
for a meeting between President Clinton and Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin. Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Richard Fisher said today 
the technical-level meeting will be a ``stocktaking'' of where the 
two countries stand on negotiations to bring China into the World

suburb, providing her the residency she needs to run for a U.S. 
Senate seat next year. The white, three-story wood frame home in 
the Westchester County town of Chappaqua was built in 1889 and 
features a swimming pool, five bedrooms, four bathrooms and two 
fireplaces. The top floor contains an exercise room. The lot, just

	DETROIT (AP) -- Detroit's public teachers remained on strike for  
a fourth day today as the school district refused to back down from 
a plan to give merit bonuses to every employee of an improved 
school. But at least one concession was made when the district 
agreed to withdraw a proposal to extend the school day by 2 hours, 
to 8 1/2 hours. In return, teachers would not oppose having aides and 
other non-teaching personnel work longer days so the district could 
offer after-school programs.

reports of damage or injuries from the quake, which occurred at 
11:17 a.m. and had a preliminary magnitude of 3.5, according to the

Stock Average gained 12.42 points to 17,643.67 in the first 30 
minutes of trading. In New York on Wednesday, the Dow Jones 
industrial average closed down 94.67 at 10,843.21, having worked 
its way back from a loss of 205 points earlier in the session.

	First Day for New Umps Goes Smoothly  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There were no problems involving the 25 new  
umpires during this afternoon's four games. They replaced 22 
veteran umpires whose firings resulted from the union's failed 
strategy of mass resignations, designed to force an early start to 
negotiations for a contract to replace the labor deal that expires 
Dec. 31. Instead of negotiating, baseball accepted the 22 
resignations and hired 25 replacements from the minors.

	Jobless Claims Rise by 4,000  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans filing new claims for  
unemployment benefits inched up last week. The Labor Department 
reported today that 289,000 Americans filed new claims for jobless 
benefits for the week ending Aug. 28, up by 4,000 from the previous 
week. That was the highest since Aug. 14, when claims matched last 
week's level. The four-week moving average for claims, which 
smoothes out week-to-week volatility, was up to 286,500 last week. 
That was the highest level since Aug. 7, when claims were at 
288,250.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Labor Department issues its final report  
on second-quarter productivity at 10 a.m. EDT. A report issued in 
early August showed second-quarter productivity growing at an 
annual rate of 1.3 percent, as compared to the 3.6 percent growth

	Boeing Machinists Approve Contract  
</P>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing Machinists went to work today with a  
freshly approved contract that union members say signals a new era 
of mutual respect between company management and hourly workers. 
The pact won 86 percent approval last night, the highest ever for a 
Boeing contract, union negotiator Dick Schneider told a cheering 
crowd after the votes were tallied. The vote was 26,842 to 4,328, 
with a 71 percent turnout from the 44,000 members of the 
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers in 
Washington, Oregon and Kansas.

	Gas Prices May Drop After Holiday  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- As the Labor Day weekend approaches, a series  
of sharp gasoline price spikes that have pinched motorists' 
pocketbooks since March appear to be nearing an end. That's because 
crude oil prices appear to be stable and other pressures that 
helped push gas prices upward, such as refinery breakdowns and 
higher summertime demand, are waning. After the holiday weekend, 
prices will begin to drop, said Bill Berman, a petroleum industry 
analyst and publisher of the Price Pump Report.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology issues lent some strength to Wall  
Street Wednesday, driving most stocks higher and helping the Dow 
Jones industrials to their first advance in a week. The Dow rose 
108.60 to 10,937.88 after having lost 496.76 over the previous four 
sessions. The index had not closed higher since last Wednesday, 
when it rose 42.74 to an all-time high of 11,326.04. Broader stock

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Intel was among the high-tech issues to revive a  
market that has sagged under interest rate concerns. The chip 
maker, up 1 1/4 yesterday to 83 7/16, led the Nasdaq and was among the 
strongest components of the S&AMP;P 500 as it unveiled a new 
microprocessor intended for use in devices that route information 
across the Internet. In a similar vein, IBM was one of the 
strongest Dow stocks, rising 2 7/16 to 127. IBM and Cisco said 
Tuesday they will jointly provide networking equipment and services

<HEADLINE>  Russian Rebels Driven From Village </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Federal forces today took control of  
a village that had been occupied by Islamic militants in southern 
Russia, and military officials said the fight against the gunmen 
would be over before the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The militants forced police and local administrators out of  
several villages in the southern republic of Dagestan last year and 
imposed a strict version of Islamic law. Russian forces began an 
offensive Sunday to drive them out. 
</P>
<P>
	The militants were driven from the village of Chabanmakhi today,  
a day after losing control of the nearby stronghold of Karamakhi, 
said Deputy Interior Minister Col Gen. Vladimir Kolesnikov. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the exact position of the militants was not known, it  
appeared that they had been expelled from all the villages they 
once occupied. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Kolesnikov said, the militants were putting up a fierce  
fight in mountains surrounding the villages. Russia continued with 
attacks from helicopter gunships as ground troops swept the areas 
they had seized. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Vyacheslav Ovchinnikov, who is commanding the Russian  
troops, said the operation against the rebels would be finished by 
Friday. He claimed that the estimated 120 remaining militants were 
surrounded and would either have to surrender or be killed. 
</P>
<P>
	NTV television news today showed Russian troops going from house  
to house in Karamakhi searching for militants. It also showed 
Russian forces firing rockets on rebel positions outside the 
village. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 25 Russians have died since the offensive began  
Sunday, Kolesnikov said. Another 143 Russians were injured, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebel losses were estimated by Russian forces at more than 100  
fighters, but that number couldn't be independently confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	The fighting is 50 miles east of where Russian troops battled  
Islamic insurgents from breakaway Chechnya in August. 
</P>
<P>
	The Karamakhi region was not involved in that round of fighting,  
which lasted for two weeks. The region is a stronghold of Islamic 
fundamentalists who have close links with their brethren in 
Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
	The villages in the district -- 25 miles south of Dagestan's  
capital, Makhachkala -- have a total population of 10,000 people, 
but most civilians fled Saturday after the gunmen refused 
government demands to hand over their weapons.

<HEADLINE>  Surreal Comedy Gets Buzz at Venice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VENICE, Italy (AP) -- You could hear a buzz in the air on Day 2  
of the Venice Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie generating the stir was a quirky, surreal comedy  
called ``Being John Malkovich,'' starring -- who else? -- John 
Malkovich, directed by Spike Jonze. 
</P>
<P>
	The film, which premiered Thursday, is Jonze's first feature  
film. But he already had a cult following thanks to a string of 
award-winning music videos for the Beastie Boys, Puff Daddy, Bjork 
and REM; commercials for Coca-Cola, Nike and Nissan; and short 
films featured at several festivals, including Sundance. 
</P>
<P>
	At first blush, Jonze seems an unlikely character to generate  
excitement. Despite the hip moniker, he's a short guy with a high, 
nasal voice who wears his fair hair brushed forward a la Bill 
Gates. 
</P>
<P>
	His real name isn't even Spike Jonze; it's Adam Spiegel. And his  
movie is, at heart, about wanting to be somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being John Malkovich,'' which also stars John Cusack, Cameron  
Diaz and Catherine Keener, is funny, original and almost impossible 
to explain. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the action takes place in the offices of the fictional  
Lester Corp. on the 7 1/2th floor of a New York office building with 
ceilings so low everyone walks around hunched over. To get there, 
you have to stop the elevator between two floors and use a crowbar 
to pry open the doors. 
</P>
<P>
	The office turns out to have a secret door, a portal into John  
Malkovich's head. Go through the door and -- presto! -- you're John 
Malkovich for 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The real John Malkovich says the story has very little to do  
with him. In fact, he joked at a standing-room-only news conference 
Thursday that being John Malkovich ``is less fun than you might 
imagine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the characters in the movie, however, being John Malkovich  
is a chance to realize their desires. These characters include a 
puppeteer played by Cusack, his wife, played by Diaz, and Cusack's 
vampish co-worker, played by Keener. There is also a chimpanzee 
with an ulcer and a 105-year-old man. 
</P>
<P>
	Malkovich first read the script, written four years ago by  
Charles Kaufmann, who had never even met Malkovich. 
</P>
<P>
	``I probably thought the title was a sort of one-line joke,''  
Malkovich said. ``Then I realized it was a 110-page joke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The movie pokes fun at a lot of things, including the sort of  
celebrity enjoyed by someone like Malkovich, whose credits include 
``Dangerous Liaisons,'' ``Of Mice and Men'' and ``Places in the 
Heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The movie also gets in licks on love, jealousy, gender, growing  
old and the effects of childhood trauma on chimps. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being John Malkovich'' is being screened at Venice in the  
``Dreams and Visions'' section of the festival, one of several 
showcases for fresh talent. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's festival, which ends Sept. 11, also features a new  
award: $100,000 and 20,000 yards of film to a first-time filmmaker.

<HEADLINE>  Strawberry Returns to Yankees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After all Darryl Strawberry has been through,  
he's not worried about proving he can still hit a baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always knew I could play baseball, and probably will go to  
my grave knowing I could play baseball, but living is more 
important,'' Strawberry said Wednesday after the New York Yankees 
recalled him from Triple-A Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been a long 11 months for Strawberry, who missed last  
year's playoffs after learning he had colon cancer and whose return 
to the majors this year was delayed by a drug suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry's teammates greeted the player who helped them win  
two World Series championships with hugs and laughter as he dressed 
for a game at Yankee Stadium for the first time since last Sept. 
27. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry didn't play in New York's 7-1 loss to Oakland, but  
was expected to be in the lineup today. It is uncertain how many 
at-bats manager Joe Torre will be able to get him this month before 
deciding on a postseason roster. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a big deal if I play or not,'' Strawberry said. ``My  
role will be what Mr. Torre wants it to be. I'm just glad to have a 
chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Strawberry out for five months, Ricky Ledee has solidified  
his spot as the left-handed left-fielder, and Chile Davis will get 
the bulk of the at-bats at designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who hit .288 with four homers in 20 games for  
Columbus, will get a chance to show off his power as a pinch-hitter 
and a fill-in as Torre gives his regulars some time off to prepare 
for the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	But Torre said he won't get wrapped up in the emotions  
surrounding the popular Strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't worry about the story, only how we're going to best  
represent ourselves,'' Torre said. ``I have to find out some things 
about Darryl. If it is a weapon, we will incorporate that into the 
club. But we have to find out if he is a weapon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry's availability has been a recurring theme around the  
Yankees for the past five seasons, as he has come back from two 
drug suspensions and a knee injury and now cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the Yankees on Aug. 4, 1995, after spending four weeks  
in the minors following a 60-day drug suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	He played sporadically and was not brought back at the start of  
1996. After a stint in the independent Northern League, Strawberry 
was brought back to New York in July 1996 and played a major role 
in helping the Yankees win the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	He played only 11 games in an injury-plagued 1997. He made his  
biggest impact last season, hitting 24 homers in 295 at-bats before 
being diagnosed with colon cancer during last year's playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	His expected return this season was delayed by chemotherapy  
treatments and then the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I look in the mirror, I look at the enemy,'' Strawberry  
said. ``There is no one to blame for this but myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That is a refrain similar to one heard after previous bouts with  
drugs and alcohol during his stormy career. And there's no telling 
whether this time will be different. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's at a point in his life where he can't allow himself to be  
in a situation where anything like this can happen again,'' Davis 
said. ``He has to see problems early and say it's not going to 
happen and walk away. That's the point he's at in his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry's teammates, who have stood behind him since his  
arrest on cocaine and solicitation charges on April 14, welcomed 
him back once again after his latest trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't take one number of chances and have it apply to  
everyone,'' said David Cone, who played with Strawberry for four 
seasons with the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very unique case. People will say he's had his chances.  
But I've seen Darryl do a lot of good with kids in the several 
years that he's been sober. You can argue both sides.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Criticizes Bush on Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore came to Texas to  
denounce the quality of the state's schools and suggest Republican 
Gov. George W. Bush is to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	While not specifically blaming his presidential rival in remarks  
at a fund-raiser, Gore said: ``The teachers are doing their job. 
The principals are doing their job. They're working hard to make it 
work, but it hasn't had the leadership or the priority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Wednesday, from 76-year-old Crockett Elementary School,  
Gore's criticism of Texas education was more subtle. 
</P>
<P>
	He highlighted the physical condition of the school, taking note  
of cracks in buildings, the use of portable classrooms to ease 
crowding and problems with plumbing and electrical wiring. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore declared the problem of deteriorating schools  
``particularly bad here in this state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He touted the Clinton administration's proposal for $24.8  
billion in interest-free bonds over two years for local public 
school modernization and chided Republicans in Congress for not 
supporting the measure.

<P>
	Bush plans to outline his education agenda in three major policy  
addresses this month, beginning with a speech today in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president is seeking the Democratic presidential  
nomination and could face Bush in next year's general election. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three out of four schools here need to improve or repair a  
building. Six out of 10 report an environmental problem like poor 
air quality. This is air children are breathing,'' Gore said at 
Crockett, in a poor Hispanic section of San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting with selected students and teachers, Gore cited more  
statistics intended to disparage Bush's education record, although 
he never criticized his potential GOP rival by name. 
</P>
<P>
	However, aides worked to make sure reporters did not miss the  
point that Bush was the real target of Gore's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Given the poor physical state of schools, Gore said, ``maybe it  
shouldn't be a surprise that Texas scores below the national 
average on SATs, or that 40 percent of Texas' students are 
unprepared when they start college or that Hispanic college 
preparedness is lagging so far behind that a recent report called 
it a `massive failure of education in Texas.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Gore told reporters education is a crucial issue for  
Hispanic voters all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's campaign spokeswoman, Mindy Tucker, responded to Gore's  
criticism by noting that Texas has closed the ``achievement gap'' 
between poor and better-off students faster during the governor's 
tenure than most other states. 
</P>
<P>
	Black 4th- and 8th-grade state reading test scores are up 23  
points since 1994, she said, and Hispanic 8th-grade math test 
scores are up 40 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Tucker added that Bush pushed for and signed a bill  
providing $400 million to help school districts pay off bond debt, 
money that leveraged $5 billion in new classroom construction.

<HEADLINE>  Strawberry Returns to Yankees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After all Darryl Strawberry has been through,  
he's not worried about proving he can still hit a baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always knew I could play baseball, and probably will go to  
my grave knowing I could play baseball, but living is more 
important,'' Strawberry said Wednesday after the New York Yankees 
recalled him from Triple-A Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been a long 11 months for Strawberry, who missed last  
year's playoffs after learning he had colon cancer and whose return 
to the majors this year was delayed by a drug suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry's teammates greeted the player who helped them win  
two World Series championships with hugs and laughter as he dressed 
for a game at Yankee Stadium for the first time since last Sept. 
27. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry didn't play in New York's 7-1 loss to Oakland, but  
was expected to be in the lineup today. It is uncertain how many 
at-bats manager Joe Torre will be able to get him this month before 
deciding on a postseason roster. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a big deal if I play or not,'' Strawberry said. ``My  
role will be what Mr. Torre wants it to be. I'm just glad to have a 
chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Strawberry out for five months, Ricky Ledee has solidified  
his spot as the left-handed left-fielder, and Chile Davis will get 
the bulk of the at-bats at designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who hit .288 with four homers in 20 games for  
Columbus, will get a chance to show off his power as a pinch-hitter 
and a fill-in as Torre gives his regulars some time off to prepare 
for the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	But Torre said he won't get wrapped up in the emotions  
surrounding the popular Strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't worry about the story, only how we're going to best  
represent ourselves,'' Torre said. ``I have to find out some things 
about Darryl. If it is a weapon, we will incorporate that into the 
club. But we have to find out if he is a weapon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry's availability has been a recurring theme around the  
Yankees for the past five seasons, as he has come back from two 
drug suspensions and a knee injury and now cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the Yankees on Aug. 4, 1995, after spending four weeks  
in the minors following a 60-day drug suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	He played sporadically and was not brought back at the start of  
1996. After a stint in the independent Northern League, Strawberry 
was brought back to New York in July 1996 and played a major role 
in helping the Yankees win the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	He played only 11 games in an injury-plagued 1997. He made his  
biggest impact last season, hitting 24 homers in 295 at-bats before 
being diagnosed with colon cancer during last year's playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	His expected return this season was delayed by chemotherapy  
treatments and then the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I look in the mirror, I look at the enemy,'' Strawberry  
said. ``There is no one to blame for this but myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That is a refrain similar to one heard after previous bouts with  
drugs and alcohol during his stormy career. And there's no telling 
whether this time will be different. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's at a point in his life where he can't allow himself to be  
in a situation where anything like this can happen again,'' Davis 
said. ``He has to see problems early and say it's not going to 
happen and walk away. That's the point he's at in his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry's teammates, who have stood behind him since his  
arrest on cocaine and solicitation charges on April 14, welcomed 
him back once again after his latest trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't take one number of chances and have it apply to  
everyone,'' said David Cone, who played with Strawberry for four 
seasons with the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very unique case. People will say he's had his chances.  
But I've seen Darryl do a lot of good with kids in the several 
years that he's been sober. You can argue both sides.''

<HEADLINE> Burton Likes To Race Clean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DARLINGTON, S.C. (AP) -- Jeff Burton feels good about the way he  
lost the Southern 500 two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	He had the fastest car and the will to tame Darlington Raceway  
in 1997. Only Jeff Gordon stood in his way. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton moved low, and Gordon blocked him. Burton moved low  
again, Gordon blocked again, the cars touching hard on the final 
lap. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton was fighting mad and thought about spinning Gordon into  
the Darlington stands. But he didn't, and Gordon won the third of 
his four straight Southern 500s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was frustrated because he had blocked me real, real badly on  
the straightaway. I was frustrated because we didn't win a race we 
should have won,'' Burton said Thursday. ``Looking back on it, I 
still think I did the right thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burton has finished second in the Southern 500 the past two  
years. But he's proud he held the line on clean racing. As he 
prepared for today's qualifying for the event's historic 50th 
running, Burton was angry NASCAR let Dale Earnhardt keep his 
Bristol win last week after the Intimidator caused leader Terry 
Labonte to spin out near the finish. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened last week, I totally disagree with. I don't  
think that's what racing is,'' said Burton, runner-up here to 
Gordon in 1997 and 1998. ``It would have been wrong for me to wreck 
the 24 (Gordon). That's not the way I race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Darlington, Burton normally races hard. Besides his two  
straight seconds, he won the rain-shortened TranSouth 400 here in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	But Burton worries that without punishment, other drivers, young  
and old, will follow Earnhardt's lead that it's OK to wreck 
competitors to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to be leading a race and get knocked out of the  
way to win it,'' he said. ``And I don't want to run second and have 
my car owner tell me, `Why didn't you knock him out of the way to 
win?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt has swapped body paint with racers almost from the  
start of his Winston Cup career. Fans have cherished his aggressive 
style, but even the crowd at Bristol disagreed with Earnhardt's 
latest move, booing him noisily in Victory Lane. 
</P>
<P>
	Darlington Raceway, a ridiculously tricky 1.366-mile oval, is  
not the place to carry a grudge. Its corners get tighter and more 
unpredictable with each layer of rubber chewed out of a racer's 
tires. If you're not focused on the track, Burton says, you're 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Winston Cup points leader Dale Jarrett earned a TranSouth 400  
win here in 1997 despite Ted Musgrave nipping at his rear bumper. 
Afterward, Jarrett thanked Musgrave for not spinning him out. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the way you'd like to think, that people are going to  
race you the way you race them,'' Jarrett said. ``That's not always 
the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Why shouldn't Earnhardt plaster rivals, Jarrett said, since  
NASCAR has let him bump and grind for 20 years. Jarrett says he has 
never wrecked anyone to win a race. ``Maybe one day I'll experience 
that and I'll find it was worth it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not likely, Burton said. He thought NASCAR should have given the  
Bristol race to runner-up Jimmy Spencer. ``If we don't prevent 
people from doing what happened Saturday night,'' he said, ``then 
it will happen a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If I can pass a guy fair and square,'' Burton says, ``that's  
the way I want to win.''

<HEADLINE> `Clinton Fatigue' Shadows Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton may have diagnosed an early  
case of what's now called ``Clinton fatigue'' long before the 
pollsters spotted symptoms in the national mood. He told about it 
himself at the New York State Fair the other day, recounting his 
own fairgrounds campaigning as governor of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 1990, at the state fair, I was thinking about running for a  
fifth term. ... This old boy in overalls came up to me and said, 
`Are you going to run again?' 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `Well, if I do, will you vote for me?'  
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `Yes, I guess so, always have.'  
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `Well, aren't you sick of me after all these years?'  
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `No, I'm not, but everybody else I know is.'''  
</P>
<P>
	That drew laughter at the fair, but the fatigue factor could  
have a serious political impact in the 2000 campaign, as Vice 
President Al Gore seeks to succeed his boss and Hillary Rodham 
Clinton tries to become a senator from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	While the president gets majority approval in the public opinion  
polls for his job performance, the numbers are reversed when people 
are asked whether they approve of him personally. A Pew Research 
Center survey last spring reported that nearly three-quarters of 
Americans said they were tired of the problems associated with the 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	A Pew poll in July showed 44 percent thought the House was right  
to impeach Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky scandal -- although only 
35 percent favored it when it was done last December. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls this summer show 43 percent of Americans want the next  
president to carry on Clinton administration policies, down 9 
points from February, and not a good sign for Gore, who shares 
those policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was asked at his last White House news conference about  
a Gallup poll in which 50 percent said they would want the next 
president to establish different policies and 38 percent wanted to 
maintain his. 
</P>
<P>
	``You should want continued change,'' Clinton replied, but he  
said that doesn't require changing parties in the White House. He 
said it should be change that builds on successful policies of the 
past. Meaning his. 
</P>
<P>
	When Vice President George Bush was campaigning for president in  
1988, the polls showed voters about evenly divided as to whether 
the nation should stay on the course set by Ronald Reagan or move 
in a new direction. But when Bush sought a second term in 1992, 
after an economic slump, three voters in four told the pollsters 
they wanted a new direction, and he lost to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	A certain weariness is inevitable near the end of a two-term  
presidency, deepened in Clinton's case not only by scandal and 
impeachment, but by the unrelenting glare of 24-hour television 
news and talk. 
</P>
<P>
	It could rub off on his wife's budding campaign. In July polling  
by Pew, 40 percent said Hillary Clinton's undeclared Senate 
campaign is getting too much news coverage. Only 18 percent said 
the same about coverage of the 2000 presidential candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	For Gore, the fatigue factor compounds the problem that always  
faces an incumbent vice president running for president -- he needs 
to show his independence without disloyalty, and to take advantage 
of the president's aggressive backing at the same time. It is a 
particular asset in fund raising, as Clinton has shown in turning 
out donors for Gore this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	There could be a downside. In a Gallup poll in May, 52 percent  
said they would be less likely to vote for Gore with Clinton 
actively campaigning for him, 29 percent said they would be more 
likely, 18 percent said it would make no difference. In a Fox News 
poll in June, more than 70 percent said Gore would be more 
successful as a candidate if he separated himself from Clinton than 
if he again praised him as ``one of our greatest presidents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That is what Gore said of Clinton after the House impeached him.  
When the vice president formally launched his 2000 campaign in 
June, he seemed to be moving away from Clinton, saying the 
president's conduct in the Lewinsky affair was inexcusable, and 
lamenting the time lost from real business because of it and 
impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Clinton was rumored to be angry, although the White  
House denied it. In any event, he's a Gore campaigner, saying the 
vice president has been at his back for seven years and he's 
returning the support. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now there's a real friend for you,'' Gore said.  
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Night of Tears for MLB Umpires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- For umpires, there is crying in baseball.  
</P>
<P>
	Eyes accustomed to calling balls and strikes were filled with  
tears Wednesday night after 22 umps lost their jobs, part of a 
complex deal between their union and baseball that was brokered by 
a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
	``It not only has broken my heart, but it has devastated me as  
an individual,'' said Tom Hallion, one of 13 NL umps let go. 
``Right now, I'm sitting here, I just did my last game. This is 
what I want to do, this is what I love to do. I love baseball. 
Right now, I hate baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the four umps on Hallion's crew were sent home for the  
season, their only hope an arbitration hearing months from now. 
Between the eighth and ninth innings, Dodger Stadium organist Nancy 
Bea Hefley paid tribute to the departing umpires with a few 
choruses of ``I'll Be Seeing You.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Baltimore, Greg Kosc had tears in his eyes as Orioles manager  
Ray Miller handed him his lineup card before the game. Mark McGwire 
held open his glove after the final out in St. Louis, giving the 
ball to Frank Pulli, a 28-year veteran. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's one of the 22 worst umpires in this league, I'm a  
kamikaze pilot,'' Cardinals third-base coach Rene Lachemann said. 
``It's a big mistake that they fired him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly one-third of the sport's 68 permanent umpires are out of  
work, although the agreement provides for them to be paid for the 
rest of the year. On July 14, more than 50 umpires announced a mass 
resignation effective Sept. 2, an attempt to force an early start 
to talks for a new labor agreement to replace the deal expiring 
Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Their strategy backfired when owners accepted the resignations,  
and 27 umps, mostly in the American League, broke ranks with union 
leader Richie Phillips, either by refusing to quit and quickly 
taking back their resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Wednesday's agreement, umpires have the right to take the  
dispute to arbitration and argue baseball should have accepted the 
resignation rescissions of all umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	Their salary and benefits for the rest of the year would be  
deducted from their termination pay if they lose the grievance. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside court room 8-B, AL ump Mark Johnson couldn't focus on  
that, and tears filled his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no idea what I'm going to do now,'' he said. ``There  
aren't a lot of opportunities out there for a 48-year old ex-major 
league umpire that I know of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires filed suit to block baseball from letting the 22 go, but  
owners had an overwhelming legal advantage because it was the 
umpires themselves who voluntarily submitted the resignations, 
which they now say was only a symbolic protest. 
</P>
<P>
	``At some point, people have to take responsibility for their  
decisions and the decisions made on their behalf,'' said Sandy 
Alderson, baseball's executive vice president of operations. ``It's 
unfortunate 22 umpires will no longer be working. We hope the 
payments each will receive will soften the transition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal mediated by U.S. District Judge J. Curtis Joyner  
during 16 hours of bargaining over two days, the union agreed the 
22 ``will provide no further services'' after 6 a.m. EDT today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think that it's a shame for baseball,'' umpires union head  
Richie Phillips said. ``Baseball will suffer from the loss of these 
enormously talented people that the commissioner's office has 
arbitrarily determined to hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, owners agreed that all umpires on staff as of  
Friday -- there will be 71 of them -- are entitled to the $20,000 
postseason bonus, an amount that totals $1.42 million. The deal 
also gives umpires the right to forgo the bonus and have it go 
directly to the union. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange, the umpires withdrew their lawsuit and the unfair  
labor practice charges against baseball they filed with the 
National Labor Relations Board. They also agreed not to strike this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five umpires hired by baseball in July became permanent  
employees today. Many are vacation fill-ins from the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``The resignations will stand and the new umpires are permanent  
employees,'' commissioner Bud Selig said. ``We are proud to have 
them on board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As several umpires left the court in the twilight of the  
evening, and perhaps their careers, they were bitter at Selig. They 
claimed that when talks recessed Tuesday night, the sides had 
agreed that any of the 22 umps could work the rest of the season at 
Selig's discretion. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took that off the table this morning,'' umpires lawyer  
Susan Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig acknowledged making the change, but said it wasn't  
significant. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no reason to put it in because they weren't going to  
work anymore,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Phillips proclaimed the deal a victory for his side,  
umpires' eyes told a different story. They couldn't believe they 
were jobless. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't these baseball people have hearts?'' NL ump Bill Hohn  
said. ``I mean, we have families. They're ruining families, and 
that's what hurts. It was a mistake, but my God, we're good people. 
We're the integrity of the game.''

<HEADLINE> Noble Wines Stem From Humble Roots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A grape variety once banned as inferior and  
unworthy is actually the ancestor of some of France's most highly 
prized wines, says a researcher who analyzed the genetic history of 
grapes from such legendary wine centers as Champagne and Burgundy. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at the University of California, Davis, analyzed the  
DNA markers of hundreds of French wines and found that 16 of the 
most popular, including Chardonnay, came from the genetic pairing 
of the classic Pinot variety and the humble Gouais blanc, a grape 
scorned by winemakers for centuries and banned from France. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is shocking that all of those varieties did spring from the  
same two parents, and ... that one of the parents is a mediocre 
grape with such a bad reputation that it was abandoned,'' said 
Carole Meredith, a genetics expert and the senior author of a study 
appearing Friday in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	French winemakers tried for centuries to kill off Gouais blanc  
``but it left behind all of these progenies,'' Meredith said. ``It 
really reaped a sweet revenge on the nobility of the wine world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It would be analogous to discovering that a grand champion show  
dog was sired by a mutt from the city pound, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wine experts were surprised and amused that wines held in such  
high regard, such as Chardonnay, known as ``the queens of the 
whites,'' had such humble origins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it puts some of the wine snobs in their place,'' Dan  
Berger, a well-known wine critic and editor of a wine newsletter, 
said with a laugh. ``It's good news for all of us because it shows 
you can rise above your origins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is quite shocking,'' grape geneticist Bruce Reisch of  
Cornell University said in Science. ``No one would have imagined 
that all (the varieties) are from the same parents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The origin of these wines has been a matter of speculation for  
many, many years,'' said Meredith. ``Now we know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In looking for the genetic ancestors of the grapes, Meredith and  
her colleagues analyzed DNA from the leaves of 300 varieties of 
grapes, including some that are no longer commonly grown. The 
sample for Gouais blanc came from a botanical archive maintained 
near Montpellier, France, by the Institut National de la Recherche 
Agronomique. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers employed classic DNA profiling techniques now  
widely used to link parents and children, or to connect a suspect 
with crime scene specimens. They compared DNA markers from each 
grape variety and found in 16 cases gene sequences that matched 
those from Pinot and Gouais blanc. The matching varieties include 
some of the most popular wines from northeast France, an area that 
includes Burgundy and Champagne. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are more than 99.99 percent sure that Pinot and Gouais  
blanc are the original parents for those 16 varieties,'' said 
Meredith. ``There's less than one chance in a trillion that we're 
wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pinot, a prized grape grown on many continents, is used to  
produce some of the most expensive wines in the world. Gouais 
blanc, a white grape, is known in only a few small areas of 
Switzerland and Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pinot-Gouais blanc cross that produced Chardonnay and others  
occurred centuries ago and was probably accidental, said Meredith. 
</P>
<P>
	Exactly how the Pinot-Gouais blanc crossing happened is not  
known, but Meredith suggests this sequence: Centuries ago, vines of 
Pinot and Gouais blanc were growing near each other. They exchanged 
pollen and produced a grape with genes from both parents. Seeds 
sprouted a vine with a unique hybrid grape that farmers liked. This 
could have happened a number of times, producing the different 
varieties through the random mix of genes from the two parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Since grapes do not breed true, all the varieties from the  
chance mating were maintained through the centuries by planted 
cuttings. Descendants of those vines now grow all over the world, 
all with the same genes of the original chance breeding, said 
Meredith. 
</P>
<P>
	Gouais blanc, the humble grape with the noble children, is  
thought to have originated in Croatia. Meredith said it is possible 
the Romans brought it to what is now France during the first 
century. Chardonnay has been grown in France since the third 
century, proving that Gouais blanc was there before that time, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Middle Ages, winemakers believed Gouais blanc made such  
poor wine that they banned it. The wine's name is based on an old 
French adjective, ``gou,'' a term of derision. 
</P>
<P>
	Meredith said Gouais blanc is still found in Germany, where it  
is known as ``huenisch weiss.'' A small area in Switzerland uses 
the grape to make a wine called ``Gwass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwass, said Meredith, ``is very ordinary. There is nothing  
really distinctive about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 16 varieties that Meredith said were produced by the  
Pinot-Gouais mating are Aligote, Aubin vert, Auxerrois, Bachet 
noir, Beaunoir, Chardonnay, Dameron, Franc noir de la Haute Saone, 
Gamay blanc Gloriod, Gamay noir, Knipperle, Melon, Peurion, 
Romorantin, Roublot and Sacy.

	Stocks End Lower; Dow Down 94.67  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks resumed their end-of-summer slump today  
as concerns about inflation and interest rates were compounded by a 
dismal earnings outlook from Sears, Roebuck and Co. The Dow Jones 
industrial average closed down 94.67 at 10,843.21, having worked 
its way back from a loss of 205 points earlier in the session. 
Broader stock indicators also closed lower. The Nasdaq composite 
index fell 16.17 to 2,734.63. Market fears escalated today as 
Federal Reserve Gov. Edward Kelley told Market News International 
it would be premature to assume the Fed will wait until next year 
to raise rates again. The Fed has already raised interest rates in 
June and August.

	U.S. Workers' Productivity Slows  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The growth of American workers' productivity  
slowed considerably in the spring while labor costs jumped sharply, 
the Labor Department said today. The twin doses of bad news helped 
shake up investors about the August unemployment figures due out 
tomorrow. Productivity, defined as the amount of output for each 
hour of work, increased at an annual rate of 0.6 percent in the 
April-June quarter, far below the 3.6 percent rate in the first 
three months of the year. Meanwhile, unit labor costs, considered a 
key measure of wage pressures, rose at an annual rate of 4.5 
percent in the second quarter, the largest increase since the first 
quarter of 1994 when they also rose 4.5 percent. In another 
economic report, the Commerce Department said orders to U.S. 
factories for manufactured goods posted a bigger-than-expected gain 
of 2.1 percent in July.

	August Retail Sales Mostly Strong  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Retailers enjoyed another strong month in  
August, as customers shrugged off rising interest rates and 
turbulence on Wall Street and kept buying at the nation's stores 
and malls. But a few hints of weakness among the sales reports 
issued today raised some concerns over the outlook for consumer 
spending in the coming months. Moderately priced department store 
chains such as J.C. Penney and Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. continued to 
lose sales to the discounters and department store chains. Sears 
also warned today that its third-quarter earnings would be lower 
than Wall Street analysts' estimates. 

</P>
<P>
	Sears Makes Changes; Stock Falls  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Still unable to boost its sagging sales and  
profits, Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. today warned that its third-quarter 
earnings would fall well below expectations and announced a shakeup 
in its executive ranks. Arthur C. Martinez, Sears' chairman and 
chief executive, will now share all corporate decision-making with 
two executives who will work with him in the newly created Office 
of the Chief Executive. Alan J. Lacy, president of Sears Credit, 
will assume additional responsibilities as president of services. 
Julian C. Day, chief financial officer since March, was named to 
the new position of executive vice president and chief operating 
officer responsible for finance, logistics and information 
technology. Sears spokeswoman Peggy Palter said the ``entire 
reason'' for the reorganization was to allow Martinez to ``focus 
more closely on the retail business.'' Sears stock sank 3 11/16 or 
almost 10 percent, at 33 1/2.

	Party Spray String Recalled  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three California companies are recalling more  
than 900,000 cans of extremely flammable party spray string after 
one child was seriously burned. When sprayed near an open flame the 
string catches fire, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said 
today. The sprays, ``Crazy Ribbon'' and ``Crazy String,'' are 
manufactured by Stelex Enterprises Inc., Major Import and LeSa Yang 
Family Ltd. The commission said customers should take the sprays 
away from children, stop using them immediately and return them to 
the store where they were purchased for a refund.

	SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. named Richard Belluzzo, the  
former head of Silicon Graphics Inc., to lead its Internet business 
in a battle against rival behemoths such as America Online Inc. and 
Yahoo! Belluzzo has been enlisted ``to help step our online 
business up to the next level,'' Microsoft President Steve Ballmer 
said in a telephone interview from the company's Redmond

Internet. Its Web investments include sites devoted to travel and 
personal finance, but the company has backed off from some

of the world's largest air carriers before falling upon hard times, 
has received final federal approval to resume regular passenger 
service. The new service will be based at Pease International 
Tradeport, site of the old Pease Air Force Base, the first of 
several military bases to close in the early 1990s to save money. 
Pan Am President Dave Fink said details of the new service are 
being worked out and will be announced soon. Initially, Pan Am will

<HEADLINE> U.S. Court Backs Environment Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court has rejected a claim  
from a Florida developer for government compensation because of 
environmental restrictions on use of his land, handing property 
rights advocates a major defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-judge panel said that the developer, who had wanted to  
fill in wetlands to build a housing complex in the Florida Keys, 
was not entitled to compensation even though the restrictions 
substantially reduced the value of his property. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision, handed down earlier this week by the U.S. Court of  
Appeals for the Federal Circuit, was announced Thursday by the 
Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Lois Schiffer, assistant attorney general for environment,  
called the decision ``a significant victory for environmental 
protection'' and said it sets an important precedent for so-called 
property ``takings'' cases brought before the federal court of 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ruling ensures that courts considering takings claims in  
the future will take a hard look at the reasonableness of a 
developers' plans in light of federal state and local environmental 
protection standards,'' said Schiffer. 
</P>
<P>
	The developer, Lloyd A. Good Jr., had sought for 13 years to  
develop a 40-acre tract of land on Sugarloaf Key in the Florida 
Keys into a 54-lot subdivision. However, 32 of the acres were 
wetlands and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers would not approve 
dredging and filling the land without certain restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Good first sought state permits to build in 1981 on the land he  
bought in 1973. Initially he obtained local and conditional state 
permits, but later was blocked from proceeding because of the 
presence of two endangered species -- the Lower Keys marsh rabbit 
and the silver rice rat. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, the Army Corps said Good would get a permit to fill in  
some of the wetland as long as he tailored the project to protect 
the two endangered species. He refused to accept those conditions 
and filed suit with the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, seeking 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	In an opinion on Tuesday, the three-judge panel upheld the  
claims court's decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior Judge Edward S. Smith, who wrote the opinion, said that  
Good had been told in 1973 and again when he sought to develop the 
property that there were ``significant restrictions'' on his 
ability to develop it. 
</P>
<P>
	Good ``lacked a reasonable, investment-backed expectation that  
he would obtain the regulatory approval needed to develop the 
property,'' wrote Smith. This ``defeats his takings claim as a 
matter of law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Court of Federal Claims had made a similar finding in  
rejecting the compensation claim. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard R. Nageotte of Stafford, Va., who argued Good's case,  
said Thursday that the decision ``wipes out the property rights 
guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless you got the property from the King of England you  
probably can never prove a reasonable investment'' because of some 
restrictive law or regulation, said Nageotte in a telephone 
interview. ``It's a devastating ruling for private property 
owners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Good had made no decision on an appeal to the U.S.  
Supreme Court, but indicated such an appeal is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Smith, the two appeals court members were Circuit  
Judges Pauline Newman and Arthur J. Gajarsa.

<HEADLINE> Bush Says Don't Aid Bad Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate George W.  
Bush said Thursday that federal funds should be confiscated from 
the worst-performing schools and made available to parents for 
private education, tutoring or ``whatever offers hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In my administration, federal money will no longer follow  
failure,'' the Texas governor told the Latin Business Association, 
a Hispanic group. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Bush's plan, every school getting the Title I money would  
be required to test its impoverished students on basic academics 
each year. A warning would be issued to schools that fail to make 
progress toward state standards. After three years of no progress, 
the Title I money would be matched with other federal education 
money and given to the state, which would set up an education 
account -- about $1,500 a year -- for each affected student. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents could choose how to spend the money. They could keep  
the money and their child in the original school or opt for an 
alternative, including private school and tutoring -- ``for whatever 
offers hope,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government currently spends $7.7 billion on Title I to help  
educate poor children. 
</P>
<P>
	A Bush aide said the plan would require states to create  
mechanisms for ensuring parents spend the money on education. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said federal programs affecting teacher training,  
curriculum research and school safety would have to prove results. 
Those that didn't would be stripped of their funding. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also proposed shifting the $4.4 billion Head Start program  
from the Department of Health and Human Services to the Education 
Department, a step he said would return the program's focus to 
preparing disadvantaged preschoolers for the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Invoking the buzzwords often heard in school-reform efforts in  
California, Texas and many other states, Bush said schools must 
establish clear goals that help measure students' basic skills. 
Testing helps ensure they achieve them, he said. And someone must 
take responsibility when they fail, he said, singling out 
principals. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, he said, local control of schools is essential  
to meeting the goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Education Secretary Richard Riley said he saw similarities  
between Bush's Title I proposal and those of his brother Jeb, who 
as Florida's governor pushed through the nation's first statewide 
voucher plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter how you dress it up, how long you delay it, or what  
you call it, a voucher is a voucher,'' Riley said. ``Gov. George W. 
Bush would have us start down the road of accountability, then take 
a dangerous detour into vouchers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We would be against a plan like this,'' said Reginald Felton,  
director of federal relations for the National School Boards 
Association. ``The objective is to raise the academic achievement 
of all students.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But at a Title I elementary school Bush visited Thursday, the  
idea of vouchers won cautious support from two teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is a good idea, because sometimes private schools  
have a lot more to offer -- more personal, smaller classes,'' said 
teacher Joann Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	She and fellow teacher Janet Leinin didn't believe that such  
programs would rob Bennett-Kew Elementary School of students and 
the public money that follows them, because, they said, it is 
academically one of the strongest in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his GOP presidential opponents, Ken Blackwell, national  
chairman of Steve Forbes' campaign, said Bush didn't go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think his program is a bit weak in one particular area -- he  
tells parents to wait three years for real school reform,'' said 
Blackwell, who is also secretary of state in Ohio, a state that is 
experimenting with vouchers. ``I don't believe and neither does 
Steve Forbes that we can wait three years for real school reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole's spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said, ``I thought it  
was more notable for what was not in it than for what was in it.'' 
He cited the discipline issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole favors school vouchers, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley, campaigning in  
Ohio said vouchers are not the answer to the problems of public 
education. ``I think that there are problems -- not the least of 
which are issues of church and state -- and ultimately they will 
have to be resolved,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As a senator from New Jersey, Bradley said he voted twice for  
federally funded voucher experiments. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush delivered his remarks in a state where voters have soundly  
rejected proposals to allow public money for private schools, an 
arrangement often referred to as school vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, Bush has backed a proposed pilot program for  
taxpayer-funded vouchers for private school tuition. State 
lawmakers have declined to pass the proposal ever since Bush became 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month a federal judge halted a voucher program in Ohio,  
saying it appeared to have the ``primary effect of advancing 
religion'' because it allowed public money to be used for religious 
and other private schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge later said the program can remain in place for  
students who participated in the program last year, but said that 
would last only one semester or until a final judgment is reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush offered a forceful defense of such programs.  
</P>
<P>
	``All monopolies are slow to reform when consumers have no power  
to express their frustration,'' he said. ``In education, parents 
who have options have influence.''

<HEADLINE> Track Evens CART Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Every track that Juan Montoya  
has raced on this season has been a new experience. 
</P>
<P>
	The sensational CART FedEx Series rookie has adjusted to the  
newness very well, winning six of the first 15 races this season 
and carrying a four-point lead over Dario Franchitti into this 
week's Vancouver Molson Indy. 
</P>
<P>
	To make matters worse for the rest of the CART competitors, the  
newly reconfigured 1.802-mile temporary street circuit at the edge 
of downtown Vancouver evens things out because it's new for 
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vancouver is a challenge because it's another of the courses  
I've never seen before,'' Montoya said. ``But I think because the 
track has been reconfigured since last year, the other rookies and 
I will have an advantage since we're not used to the old layout.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the final quarter of the 20-race season about to begin,  
Montoya could be excused if he felt a little pressure from the 
championship battle with Franchitti. But last year's European 
Formula 3000 champion is just fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm having too much fun to feel nervous,'' Montoya said. ``Not  
one expected me to be doing so well so soon, so I don't feel any 
pressure. Besides, I'm a rookie. I have nothing to lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya is riding a two-race winning string. Moreover, he has  
won races on each type of track where CART races, including the 
temporary street circuit in Long Beach, Calif., permanent road 
courses and ovals. 
</P>
<P>
	But Franchitti and teammate Paul Tracy have finished 1-2 in the  
last two CART street races, in Toronto and Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only that, but Franchitti won last year's race in Vancouver  
from the pole. That victory -- only his second in CART -- established 
the Scotsman as a legitimate title contender. 
</P>
<P>
	``That victory proved that winning the previous race at Road  
America was no fluke,'' Franchitti said. ``Above all else, I think 
it signaled to everyone in CART that our team had arrived. We 
became the team to beat as the season ended.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tracy and Michael Andretti are the only other drivers with a  
legitimate shot at winning this year's PPG Cup championship. But 
both need to begin making a move in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	Heading into the opening of practice today, Andretti trails  
Montoya by 48 points and Tracy is two more back. 
</P>
<P>
	But Andretti, the only one of the top four in the points race  
who has won a championship, isn't ready to concede just yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Realistically, getting back into it, the way those two are  
going, isn't going to be easy,'' the second-generation Champ Car 
star said. ``But a couple of wins, a couple of weeks with max 
points and ... who knows? 
</P>
<P>
	``There are still 110 points out there. But we can't keep  
letting things get away from us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andretti and Tracy lost considerable ground two weeks ago when  
they tangled in a controversial wreck. 
</P>
<P>
	The two were battling side-by-side for third place early in the  
Target Grand Prix on the new Chicago Motor Speedway oval when they 
collided, sending both hard into the wall. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't the first time the two antagonists have tangled. In  
fact, Tracy was held out of the first race this season as a penalty 
for an on-track incident with Andretti last fall in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to get somebody hurt one of these days,'' Andretti  
said of Tracy. ``He doesn't use his head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tracy called the latest incident a racing accident, saying  
Andretti should accept at least part of the blame. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing is ever his fault,'' Tracy said. ``We were racing to  
the corner and I had the position, as far as I'm concerned. He 
didn't back off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But both said all that matter now is the 22 points -- one for the  
pole, 20 for winning the race and one for leading the most laps -- 
that are out there for the taking this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``This time, I'd like to reverse roles with Dario and get the  
victory for myself,'' Tracy said. ``I definitely need to win some 
races to get back into the championship race with Juan and Dario.''

<HEADLINE>  Night of Tears for MLB Umpires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- For umpires, there is crying in baseball.  
</P>
<P>
	Eyes accustomed to calling balls and strikes were filled with  
tears Wednesday night after 22 umps lost their jobs, part of a 
complex deal between their union and baseball that was brokered by 
a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
	``It not only has broken my heart, but it has devastated me as  
an individual,'' said Tom Hallion, one of 13 NL umps let go. 
``Right now, I'm sitting here, I just did my last game. This is 
what I want to do, this is what I love to do. I love baseball. 
Right now, I hate baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the four umps on Hallion's crew were sent home for the  
season, their only hope an arbitration hearing months from now. 
Between the eighth and ninth innings, Dodger Stadium organist Nancy 
Bea Hefley paid tribute to the departing umpires with a few 
choruses of ``I'll Be Seeing You.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Baltimore, Greg Kosc had tears in his eyes as Orioles manager  
Ray Miller handed him his lineup card before the game. Mark McGwire 
held open his glove after the final out in St. Louis, giving the 
ball to Frank Pulli, a 28-year veteran. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's one of the 22 worst umpires in this league, I'm a  
kamikaze pilot,'' Cardinals third-base coach Rene Lachemann said. 
``It's a big mistake that they fired him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly one-third of the sport's 68 permanent umpires are out of  
work, although the agreement provides for them to be paid for the 
rest of the year. On July 14, more than 50 umpires announced a mass 
resignation effective Sept. 2, an attempt to force an early start 
to talks for a new labor agreement to replace the deal expiring 
Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Their strategy backfired when owners accepted the resignations,  
and 27 umps, mostly in the American League, broke ranks with union 
leader Richie Phillips, either by refusing to quit and quickly 
taking back their resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Wednesday's agreement, umpires have the right to take the  
dispute to arbitration and argue baseball should have accepted the 
resignation rescissions of all umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	Their salary and benefits for the rest of the year would be  
deducted from their termination pay if they lose the grievance. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside court room 8-B, AL ump Mark Johnson couldn't focus on  
that, and tears filled his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no idea what I'm going to do now,'' he said. ``There  
aren't a lot of opportunities out there for a 48-year old ex-major 
league umpire that I know of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires filed suit to block baseball from letting the 22 go, but  
owners had an overwhelming legal advantage because it was the 
umpires themselves who voluntarily submitted the resignations, 
which they now say was only a symbolic protest. 
</P>
<P>
	``At some point, people have to take responsibility for their  
decisions and the decisions made on their behalf,'' said Sandy 
Alderson, baseball's executive vice president of operations. ``It's 
unfortunate 22 umpires will no longer be working. We hope the 
payments each will receive will soften the transition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal mediated by U.S. District Judge J. Curtis Joyner  
during 16 hours of bargaining over two days, the union agreed the 
22 ``will provide no further services'' after 6 a.m. EDT today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think that it's a shame for baseball,'' umpires union head  
Richie Phillips said. ``Baseball will suffer from the loss of these 
enormously talented people that the commissioner's office has 
arbitrarily determined to hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, owners agreed that all umpires on staff as of  
Friday -- there will be 71 of them -- are entitled to the $20,000 
postseason bonus, an amount that totals $1.42 million. The deal 
also gives umpires the right to forgo the bonus and have it go 
directly to the union. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange, the umpires withdrew their lawsuit and the unfair  
labor practice charges against baseball they filed with the 
National Labor Relations Board. They also agreed not to strike this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five umpires hired by baseball in July became permanent  
employees today. Many are vacation fill-ins from the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``The resignations will stand and the new umpires are permanent  
employees,'' commissioner Bud Selig said. ``We are proud to have 
them on board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As several umpires left the court in the twilight of the  
evening, and perhaps their careers, they were bitter at Selig. They 
claimed that when talks recessed Tuesday night, the sides had 
agreed that any of the 22 umps could work the rest of the season at 
Selig's discretion. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took that off the table this morning,'' umpires lawyer  
Susan Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig acknowledged making the change, but said it wasn't  
significant. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no reason to put it in because they weren't going to  
work anymore,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Phillips proclaimed the deal a victory for his side,  
umpires' eyes told a different story. They couldn't believe they 
were jobless. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't these baseball people have hearts?'' NL ump Bill Hohn  
said. ``I mean, we have families. They're ruining families, and 
that's what hurts. It was a mistake, but my God, we're good people. 
We're the integrity of the game.''

<HEADLINE> More Immigrants Are Staying Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of immigrants living in poverty  
across the country has grown and they are remaining poor longer 
than in the past, according to a study released today. 
</P>
<P>
	The portion of immigrants living in poverty grew from about one  
in six in 1979 to more than one in five in 1997, according to the 
study from the Center for Immigration Studies. The total number in 
poverty tripled from 2.2 million to 7.7 million during that period, 
with the highest rates in California, Texas and South Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The growth of immigrant poverty, which occurred during a period  
when poverty in native households remained steady, meant that 
immigrants now account for more than one in five of all poor 
families nationwide, compared to less than one in 10 two decades 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Immigrants are also climbing out of poverty more slowly, the  
report found. For example, more than one in four immigrants who 
arrived during the 1980s remained impoverished in 1997, which was 
twice the rate for natives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans may disagree over the best way to address poverty,''  
said Mark Krikorian, the center's executive director. ``But there 
can be no doubt that ongoing immigration is diverting scarce public 
and private resources that are needed to help the poor already 
here, native-born and immigrants, improve their circumstances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Poverty was defined as the federal threshold of $16,400 for a  
family of four. 
</P>
<P>
	The report blamed the higher poverty rates on the lower levels  
of education, higher unemployment and larger family sizes of 
immigrants. But the report said that welfare reform and illegal 
immigrants weren't responsible for the broadening poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	In California, nearly one in four of the 11.3 million immigrants  
were living in poverty in 1997. That was nearly twice the poverty 
rate for 21.6 million natives. Half the immigrants came from Mexico 
and Central America, with about one in six from Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, 28.7 percent of immigrants live in poverty. In  
Arizona, 36.4 percent. In Florida, the figure was 22.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Rebounding After Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- When angry pilots went on strike against  
Northwest Airlines last year, equally angry travelers revived a 
nickname that has plagued the airline from time to time: 
``Northworst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The strike shut down the nation's fourth-largest carrier for 15  
days and contributed to more than $1 billion in losses from labor 
problems. One year later, Northwest is back on top in the on-time 
rankings, the airline is back in the black, workers are mostly 
happy and the scornful nickname is on ice. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, things are looking up for Northwest.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think Northwest is definitely an airline on their way back.  
To a great degree, they are back,'' said Terry Trippler, an airline 
expert with 1travel.com. ``I think they're doing it faster than any 
of us thought they would.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Northwest's regular passengers have returned, said  
George Wozniak of Hobbit Travel in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously during the strike it was, 'I'll never fly those  
bozos again.' The majority have returned because of the frequent 
flier program,'' Wozniak said. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline is buying new planes and refurbishing others, buying  
equipment to keep passenger-filled planes cool on the ground and 
improving the food for business and first-class passengers. 
Northwest has improved to No. 2 in baggage handling, hired 
additional staff and increased training for ground operations 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	After three money-losing quarters, the carrier returned to  
profitability in the quarter ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been working very hard and our people have been  
working very hard to provide consistent, reliable service to our 
passengers,'' said Richard Anderson, who was named to the new 
position of chief operating officer in mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
	During the strike, Northwest was buffeted by ill winds from more  
than one direction -- pilots seeking higher pay and better job 
security, customers angry about disrupted business and vacation 
plans and politicians demanding more airline competition to bring 
down fares at Northwest's hubs in Minneapolis-St. Paul, Detroit and 
Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots got much of what they wanted, gaining $156 million in the  
four-year contract that ended the strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the Air Line Pilots Association credited Anderson  
for many positive changes at Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an operations guy. He says, 'What's the problem?' and  
he's willing to get it fixed,'' said ALPA spokesman Paul Omodt. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, considered a likely candidate to succeed John Dasburg  
as chief executive down the road, has instituted monthly meetings 
with both pilots and ground workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants an ongoing labor relations thing. You're starting to  
see the change,'' Omodt said. ``Employees are back into being No. 
1. It feels good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there still could be turbulence ahead.  
</P>
<P>
	Flight attendants will be going back to the negotiating table  
after rejecting a contract proposal last week that would have 
raised pay an average of 14 percent, boosted pensions and increased 
job security. Mechanics, who split off from the International 
Association of Machinists to join the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal 
Association, are preparing to begin contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Reaching agreement with the remaining employees is ``very  
important'' to Northwest's recovery, Anderson said. Dasburg has 
said that Northwest can't claim it is a top-quality airline until 
its labor problems are settled. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's the looming fare dispute.  
</P>
<P>
	Northwest still dominates its hubs. As a result, air traffic was  
cut to a trickle during the strike, and many smaller cities lost 
all air service because Northwest's regional Airlink partners also 
shut down. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Department of Transportation and Congress are looking  
at ways to increase airline competition, improve service to small 
and medium-size communities and reduce fares throughout the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest is starting to see some competition. Sun Country  
Airlines now operates regularly scheduled service out of 
Minneapolis-St. Paul to more than a dozen cities. Icelandair has 
beefed up its service to northern Europe and Vanguard Airlines has 
added flights, said Wendy Burt, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan 
Airports Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	American, America West, Continental, Delta, Frontier, TWA,  
United and USAirways also offer scheduled service and there are 
several charter operations serving the Twin Cities. Detroit, in 
addition to the major carriers, is served by Southwest, Ryan, 
Spirit and TransAir. 
</P>
<P>
	But Northwest remains the giant. The airline says it flies 53  
percent of passengers whose trips originate or end in 
Minneapolis-St. Paul. For Detroit, the figure is 40 percent. Those 
figures do not include passengers connecting with Northwest at the 
hubs via Northwest's regional Airlink partners. When passengers 
making connections are counted, the Northwest percentage rises to 
about 80 at the three hub airports.

<HEADLINE> New Umpire Ejects Tampa Bay Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- First-base umpire Marty Foster, who became a  
permanent member of the American League staff earlier in the day, 
ejected Tampa Bay manager Larry Rothschild in the sixth inning of 
Thursday night's game against Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Rothschild protested Foster's safe call on Derrick May's  
grounder. Tampa Bay shortstop Aaron Ledesma fielded May's grounder 
and forced Albert Belle at second, but Foster ruled May beat second 
baseman Miguel Cairo's relay to avert an inning-ending double play. 
</P>
<P>
	Rothschild jogged to debate Foster's call behind first base.  
After a short, civil discussion, their argument became briefly 
animated before Foster ejected Rothschild. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third ejection this season for Rothschild. Foster,  
39, had been a Triple-A umpire before Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was fine,'' Rothschild said. ``He gave me a chance to walk  
away.''

<HEADLINE> Feds: Car Theft Rings Are Busted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Two Philadelphia-based car theft rings that  
stretched across five states and stole thousands of cars worth $40 
million have been shut down, federal authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-seven people were arrested Thursday morning in  
Philadelphia and New Jersey, from alleged gang leaders to copy shop 
employees who allegedly duplicated car titles. 
</P>
<P>
	``These auto theft rings affect the quality of life for most of  
us more than the high-profile sensational violent crimes,'' U.S. 
Attorney Michael Stiles said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two separate operations stole cars in Pennsylvania, New  
Jersey, New York, Maryland, Delaware and Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors described a network of junkyards, body shops and  
thieves with a hotline that would allow orders to be placed for 
stolen cars and parts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody in a chop shop says he needs a black Oldsmobile  
Intrigue door. ... Somewhere down the line, somebody goes and 
steals a black Oldsmobile Intrigue,'' Stiles said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 percent of the cars were stolen at the request of their  
owners for insurance scams, prosecutors said. The thieves would 
keep the cars, and the owners would collect insurance money. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are legitimate members of the community. Someone buys a  
lemon and does not want to continue making car payments. They know 
someone or someone approaches them and they say, `Could you arrange 
to have it stolen?''' said Philadelphia District Attorney Lynne 
Abraham. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said they were pursuing charges against people who  
bought stolen cars or asked to have their cars stolen. A small 
portion of the stolen cars were sent by ship to China. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders of one operation, Frank Ozga III and Patrick Smith  
Sr., worked out of body shops and two junkyards in Philadelphia 
since 1991, according to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozga and Smith were accused of money laundering, replating  
violations and failing to report $1.2 million in illegal income. 
Other defendants were charged with stealing, chopping, delivering 
or putting fake plates on stolen cars or car parts. 
</P>
<P>
	The second ring was alleged to have earned $23 million for  
delivering and selling stolen cars between 1995 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspects allegedly stole cars from shopping malls, car  
dealerships and airport and hotel parking lots in Philadelphia, 
drove the cars to New York, where ID numbers and license plates 
were stripped and replaced, and resold them in Philadelphia or 
Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrests and indictments were the result of undercover  
investigations that began four year ago and involved more than 100 
federal, state and local law enforcement agents. Ongoing 
investigations are expected to bring additional charges against 
co-conspirators in New York, Delaware, Maryland and Georgia, Stiles 
said.

<HEADLINE> Bone Marrow Stem Cells Identified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers have found a way to identify and  
isolate special stem cells in the bone marrow, a development that 
could lead to new treatments for blood diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists at Jefferson Medical College report on Friday in the  
journal Science that hematopoietic stem cells have a protein 
marker, called KDR, that can be used as sort of a beacon to isolate 
them from other, similar-looking cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The stem cells are made in the bone marrow. They can develop  
into any kind of blood cell and can reproduce endlessly. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers believe if the stem cell can be isolated and  
cultured in the laboratory, it could be used to grow red, white and 
platelet blood cells, all of which have important medical 
applications. For instance, it is believed the stem cell could be 
used to produce blood for transfusions or cells for bone marrow 
transplants. 
</P>
<P>
	But the stem cells are rare, making up only one of every 100,000  
cells in the bone marrow. Researchers have had trouble isolating 
them from other bone marrow cells that they closely resemble. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the technique developed by a Jefferson team led by Dr.  
Cesare Peschle may have solved that problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers have found an antibody that they can use to  
separate the valuable stem cells from the other cells in the bone 
marrow. Repeated use of the technique allows the stem cells to be 
concentrated into useful numbers, the researchers report.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was steady against the yen early Friday  
ahead of the release of key U.S. economic data. Japanese stocks 
opened mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 109.42 yen in early trading, unchanged from  
late Thursday in Tokyo but higher than its late New York level of 
109.11 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 12.42  
points, or 0.07 percent, to 17,643.67 in the first 30 minutes of 
trading. On Thursday, the average closed down 171.23 points, or 
0.96 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, players were awaiting the release of U.S.  
employment figures for August, due out in Washington later Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's relative strength from its New York level came  
after some investors bought the dollar to cover short, or oversold, 
positions in early Asian trading, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also got support from comments by Eisuke Sakakibara,  
Japan's former vice finance minister for international affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	In a U.S. television interview broadcast Friday on CNBC,  
Sakakibara, now an advisor to the Finance Ministry, said currency 
``intervention is always a strategic decision,'' which depends on 
market conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Sakakibara's remarks, there have been no recent signs of  
dollar-buying intervention by the Bank of Japan, the country's 
central bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese officials have repeatedly said a premature  
strengthening of the yen is undesirable amid sporadic signs that 
Japan is recovering from its worst recession in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 117.26 yen, up from  
115.86 late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices were suppressed by the strong yen  
and a 94.67-point fall in the Dow Jones industrial average. The Dow 
closed at 10,843.23 points on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The yen remains strong, and that is hurting stock market  
sentiment,'' said Yasushi Hoshi, a market analyst at Daiwa 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	A higher yen makes Japanese exports more expensive and thus less  
competitive abroad, reducing foreign revenues when translated into 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 1.04 points, or 0.07 percent, to 1,495.95. 
The TOPIX closed up 0.75 points, or 0.05 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond was  
unquoted in early trading. On Thursday it settled at 1.8850 percent 
and its price stood at 100.12 yen.

<HEADLINE> 'Junior' Gotti Faces Sentencing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- John A. ``Junior'' Gotti has long  
followed in his infamous father's footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
	Like his father, he became a made member of the Gambino crime  
family and ascended to family boss. This morning, like father, John 
J. Gotti, young Gotti goes to jail for engaging in racketeering and 
other crimes linked to his life in organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Gotti, 35, faces far less time than his father when he stands  
before U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker. While the elder Gotti 
is serving life without parole, the son faces a maximum of 84 
months -- just over seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Junior'' Gotti pleaded guilty in April to charges of bribery,  
extortion, gambling and fraud. He also pleaded guilty to tax and 
loansharking charges that were looming in Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors claimed he had inherited a leadership position in  
the Gambino crime family when his father was jailed for life on a 
1992 racketeering conviction that included five murders. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted at trial, the younger Gotti faced up to 15 years  
and millions of dollars in fines. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the night before the start of his April trial, he  
accepted the plea offer. The government asked for Gotti to receive 
the maximum sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gotti's pattern of criminal activity is sprawling and reflects  
a willingness on his part to corrupt all aspects of life,'' 
prosecutors wrote in a pre-sentencing letter to Parker. 
</P>
<P>
	They added they would have proven that ``the racketeering  
enterprise of which Gotti was a high-ranking member for almost a 
decade was the Gambino Family of La Cosa Nostra.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attached to the letter were excerpts of comments made by John J.  
Gotti when he learned, in prison, of his son's indictment. 
Infuriated by the carelessness that allowed agents to find piles of 
cash and a roster of gangland members, Gotti said his son and 
codefendants ``should never be sent to jail. They should all be 
sent to the insane asylum. ... I wanna know what part of this was 
intelligent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Gotti was known as the Teflon Don for avoiding  
conviction in three trials until he was finally convicted in 1992. 
The racketeering case alleged five murders -- including that of his 
predecessor, Paul Castellano -- and relied on the testimony of the 
Mafia's highest-ranking turncoat, Salvatore ``Sammy the Bull'' 
Gravano. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, the younger Gotti earned a reputation as a mediocre  
mob leader -- one tabloid dubbed him ``Dumbfella.'' He also drew 
attention for stunts like as visiting a Toys R Us in Queens after 
hours to buy the store's stock of hard-to-find Tickle Me Elmo 
dolls. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendant was indicted more than a year ago with 39 other  
men on mob-related charges, many of them stemming from an alleged 
extortion scheme at the Manhattan topless club Scores. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent eight months at the Westchester County jail before he  
was released in September to house arrest, which included a guard 
at his door, a tap on his phone and an electronic bracelet on his 
ankle.

	Clinton Wants Waco Investigation  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton wants an independent  
investigation into the FBI's 1993 assault on the Branch Davidian 
cult near Waco, Texas. Previously undisclosed evidence has been 
impounded by federal marshals, an FBI source said yesterday. The 
marshals took custody of an infrared videotape recorded during the 
early morning of April 19, 1993, when FBI agents lobbed incendiary 
tear-gas canisters at a concrete bunker adjacent to the Davidians' 
compound, the source said. Hours after the canisters were fired, 
the wooden compound erupted in flames, killing some 80 people.

peace accord, Albright said she could do only so much to bring the

helpful, it is up to the parties themselves to make the hard 
decisions,'' she said. Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are at 
an impasse over how many Palestinian prisoners may be released.

expectations and announced a management shakeup. Sears, still mired 
in a slump despite a series of changes aimed at reviving its 
business, disclosed the news as it reported disappointing sales for 
the month of August. Analysts said today's announcement clearly 
signaled that the marketing and merchandising campaign Sears 
embarked on this year isn't yet paying off.

	Winds Restore Storm-Torn Hatteras  
</P>
<P>
	WAVES, N.C. (AP) -- Winds have filled a gap on Hatteras Island  
with sand, enough of a fix to allow National Guard vehicles to 
cross. The road remained closed to regular drivers, although crews 
expected to get the section of highway north of the torn-up stretch 
to be reopened to limited traffic later today. Power was restored 
today to all but 500 of the island's 5,000 permanent residents. 
Telephone service remained out but ferry service also resumed to 
Hatteras Island and Ocracoke Island, where about 700 people have 
been isolated since Tropical Storm Dennis struck Monday.

	Army To Demote Ret. Maj. Gen. Hale  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army's civilian chief has decided to  
demote a retired general who admitted having sex with the wives of 
four subordinates and was court-martialed in March, The Associated 
Press was told today. The decision by Army Secretary Louis Caldera 
means a loss of retirement pay for David Hale, who was a two-star 
major general when he retired last year. A knowledgeable source who 
spoke on condition of anonymity said Caldera would reduce Hale to 
brigadier general, a one-star rank.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply today as concerns about

outlook from Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. Just before 1 p.m. EDT, the Dow 
Jones industrial average was down 151.98 at 10,785.90. Declining 
issues on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered advancers 2,125

	AUBURN, N.Y. (AP) -- The vacationing President Clinton and his  
wife have made a bid on a Georgian colonial house they toured last 
weekend in a New York City suburb, sources said. The Clintons 
offered less than the nearly $1.7 million asking price, but sources 
would not detail the negotiations. The couple spent two hours 
touring the 110-year-old Westchester County house on a little more 
than an acre of parklike grounds. Mrs. Clinton is considering 
running for a Senate seat in New York next year.

</P>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- After just one season on the job, Colorado Rockies  
manager Jim Leyland is talking about leaving, and the team's owners 
are hinting that he has already decided to resign. Leyland, 
disappointed with Rockies' poor performance, is considering 
retiring as a baseball manager altogether, according to Denver 
newspaper reports. After 35 years in professional baseball, Leyland 
reportedly said he no longer is certain he has the drive to lead a 
major league team.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When Carlos Moya pulled out of the U.S. Open  
because of a bad back Thursday, he was the third player who had 
been ranked No. 1 to withdraw this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Moya was trailing Nicolas Escude of France 1-6, 4-6, 1-0 when he  
called it quits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had this pain for 10 days already,'' he said. ``It got  
really worse and really bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moya became No. 1 on March 15, becoming the first Spanish man  
and the 15th player to hold the top ranking. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, top-ranked Pete Sampras withdrew with an injured  
back and Patrick Rafter, who held the No. 1 spot earlier this year, 
pulled out with a tear in the right rotator cuff. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CLOSE TO PERFECT:* Conchita Martinez was nearly perfect in the  
second set of her 6-0, 6-0 victory over Alexia Dechaume-Balleret of 
France. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second set, Dechaume-Balleret won just five points. She  
won 16 points in the match.

	 *LIGHTS, CAMERA, ACTION:* Mark Keil of Kauai, Hawaii, is a busy  
man at the U.S. Open this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides competing in men's doubles, Keil is filming a  
documentary, ``Beyond the Baseline.'' in which the former 
University of South Florida student interviews fellow ATP Tour 
players behind the scenes at tournaments around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a one-year odyssey with me, a player, as I film the  
top-ranked players around the world on the tour from hotels to 
locker rooms to player parties,'' said Keil, who beat Pete Sampras 
on a grass court at Queens Club in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Keil said he was inspired to pursue the film project when  
reading Andy Warhol's autobiography last Christmas. In the 
autobiography, Warhol spoke of documenting as much of his life as 
possible with a personal camera.

	 *TELLING IT LIKE IT IS:* Two-time U.S. Open winner Tracy Austin,  
now a television commentator on the USA Network, said the WTA Tour 
is able to get along very well even though Steffi Graf has retired. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time someone like Steffi leaves, with 22 Grand Slams in  
her resume, it's a huge loss,'' Austin told viewers. ``But luckily, 
I think, women's tennis has so many stars right now, it's not going 
to be a big gap. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lindsay Davenport and (Martina) Hingis going for that No. 1  
ranking back-and-forth. The Williams sisters starting to come on 
and really do some big things. Venus (Williams) with her highest 
ranking ever at No. 3 and Serena (Williams) with her highest 
ranking at No. 6. I don't think they've come close to fulfilling 
their potential. 
</P>

	``And you've got Anna Kournikova, who's not even here this year  
with a stress fracture in her foot. She's got a ton of potential.''

	 *TURNING IT AROUND:* Since his surprising run to the French  
Open, where he lost to Andre Agassi, Andre Medvedev has won only 
three matches in six tournaments before the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything was so unexpected at Roland Garros and I came so  
close to winning it that after that the smaller tournaments, you 
just struggle for motivation,'' said Medvedev, who gained a berth 
in the third round Thursday by beating Canada's Sebastian Lareau 
6-4, 6-1, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just surprised to get through the first two rounds here  
because frankly I don't feel I was playing well,'' Medvedev said. 
``But I must be doing something right. I came here with the goal to 
get to the second week, so I'm on my way.''

<HEADLINE> Guard Killed in New Mexico Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- A fiery uprising by 290 inmates that led  
to the killing of a corrections guard at a private prison has 
sparked renewed criticism of the facilities in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``The death of a guard means that these institutions are out of  
control,'' Democratic state Sen. Cisco McSorley said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ralph Garcia, 42, was the first prison guard killed in a dozen  
years in New Mexico. But in the past nine months, four inmates have 
been killed in prisons operated by Wackenhut Corrections Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia was stabbed numerous times with a homemade knife in an  
attack by as many as nine inmates at the Guadalupe County 
Correctional Facility, one of two prisons in New Mexico operated by 
Florida-based Wackenhut. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tuesday riot near Santa Rosa was sparked by the prison's  
attempt to lock down the facility after an inmate was stabbed in a 
gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think in any way you can point the finger at Wackenhut  
for something that was done by inmates,'' said Republican Gov. Gary 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson and Corrections Secretary Rob Perry said they haven't  
decided whether to follow through on Perry's threat to remove 
inmates from private prisons if more deaths or disturbances 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	That warning followed an Aug. 17 disturbance at a prison run by  
Corrections Corporation of America in which two guards were 
injured.

<HEADLINE> Jury Clears Supermarkets of Fixing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A jury Thursday cleared the three dominant  
Southern California grocery chains of charges they conspired to 
overcharge consumers for eggs. 
</P>
<P>
	After nearly five days of deliberations and six weeks of  
testimony, the San Diego County Superior Court jury voted 9-to-3 to 
clear Vons, Ralphs and Lucky Stores of conspiring to keep Southern 
California egg prices high between 1992 to 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The class-action lawsuit could have cost the chains $267 million  
in damages under a state antitrust law granting the plaintiffs 
three times the amount of the alleged overcharge, which was 
calculated at between $83 million and $89 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury forewoman Kelly Briggs said the plaintiffs failed to  
convince enough jurors that the three competing grocery chains 
reached a back-room agreement to cheat consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``They never gave us anything. There was no smoking gun,'' said  
Briggs, a corporate relations manager from Poway. 
</P>
<P>
	Several jurors said the stores' legal practice of checking and  
matching each other's prices could account for any similarities in 
the cost of a dozen eggs. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Howarth, one of the lawyers for the plaintiffs in the  
lawsuit said he was surprised and disappointed by the outcome. 
``It's a very hard verdict after a long trial,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Howarth said the judge in the case could still rule that the  
grocery chains engaged in unfair competition as defined by the 
state Cartwright Act. 
</P>
<P>
	But a lawyer for Vons, Gregory Stone of San Diego, said the  
judge was unlikely to rule against the supermarkets given the 
jury's verdict in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``The jury was able to see that neither Vons nor the other  
defendants engaged in price fixing,'' Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the plaintiffs in the suit claimed that the stores  
in Southern California counties charged an average of between $1.99 
and $2.09 compared with prices as low as $1 per dozen elsewhere in 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	They claimed the three conspired to keep the prices high in the  
counties of San Diego, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San 
Bernardino and Imperial. This was accomplished, they argued, after 
an outbreak of avian flu in the early 1980s caused a spike in 
prices nationwide that eventually subsided in all regions but 
Southern California.

<HEADLINE> Woody Harrelson Rewrites His Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- With a little help from a friend, Woody  
Harrelson has rewritten his 1993 play ``Furthest From the Sun'' and 
picked Minneapolis for its premiere. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor said he picked Minneapolis and the Theatre de la Jeune  
Lune because he wanted to be ``away from New York and Los Angeles 
and all those distractions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The play opens Sept. 10 and will run through Sept. 25. It's the  
story of a summer Harrelson spent in Houston with two friends after 
college. 
</P>
<P>
	An earlier version premiered in Los Angeles six years ago, but  
Harrelson said he had lost track of one of the pals, Frankie Hyman, 
and it lacked his voice. 
</P>
<P>
	So the actor tracked down Hyman and asked him to help out on the  
script. What he found was a junkie who had hit bottom. Harrelson 
helped his friend clean up and the two rewrote the play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although I'd captured his spirit and his heart the first time  
around, what the play was missing was Frankie's voice,'' Harrelson 
said.

<HEADLINE> Ford faces $1.5M Fine in Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- A state agency said today it is fining Ford Motor  
Co. $1.5 million for at least a dozen workplace violations stemming 
from the February explosion in the Rouge complex that killed six 
workers 
</P>
<P>
	The Michigan Occupational and Safety Administration outlined  
fines, safety violations and specific safety changes that Ford has 
agreed to make. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the $1.5 million fine, Ford will spend $5 million on  
burn care at area hospitals, occupational health and safety 
measures and a union scholarship fund in memory of those who died 
in the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	``This historic agreement cannot reclaim lost lives, it cannot  
restore broken bodies. But it can ease the suffering of the victims 
and their families by assuring a safer and healthier work 
environment for all Ford employees in the future,'' said Kathy 
Wilbur, director of Michigan Consumer and Industry Services. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said it has agreed to specific safety changes, including  
inspection and upgrading of all boilers if necessary. It will not 
contest the fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot change the terrible events of the past, but we can  
work hard to make our workplaces safer in the future,'' James 
Padilla, Ford manufacturing group vice president, said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Feb. 1 explosion in the powerhouse at the Dearborn complex  
also injured 14 workers. 
</P>
<P>
	MIOSHA investigators collected more than 30,000 pages of  
documents during the seven-month investigation. The agency also 
reviewed more than 100,000 documents from Ford and Dearborn fire 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the explosion was an inadvertent buildup of natural  
gas in Boiler No. 6, which was being shut down for a planned 
inspection and overhaul, according to a joint report released today 
by Ford and the United Auto Workers. However, the report didn't 
determine a source of the gas ignition. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the state, the primary factor in the accident was  
that Ford did not adequately train its boiler operators. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, the automaker announced it had hired CEC Consultants, a  
Cleveland firm, to help it examine safety procedures at power 
plants across North America. 
</P>
<P>
	The families of three workers have sued Rouge Steel, which  
co-owns the Rouge complex. Those claims are expected to be dropped 
after the families of the workers sign settlements with Ford, which 
has offered more than $30 million to settle claims.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Outlaws Textbook Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis has signed into law a  
measure barring references to consumer products in school books 
purchased with state money. 
</P>
<P>
	The law, which Davis approved Wednesday, requires all books  
submitted to the state Board of Education to meet the bill's 
standards after Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Math problems involving products like Nike sneakers, M&AMP;M candies  
and Oreo cookies appear in a 6th-grade textbook, ``Mathematics 
Applications and Connections,'' developed by Glencoe, a division of 
McGraw-Hill. Other books contain similar uses of brand-name 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's inappropriate, in that it's pushing products. We're  
trying to get away from this very quiet level of advertising,'' 
said Erika Hoffman, legislative representative for the state 
Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's not advertising, said Bill Jordan, McGraw-Hill's  
director of media relations. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we develop textbooks, we get a lot of feedback from a lot  
of users of our books, and one thing that kept coming through loud 
and clear was, use real-world examples,'' he said. ``Make it 
relevant to the kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan said McGraw-Hill was not paid to use any of the brand  
names. The company simply selected names they felt would be 
recognized by the children using the books. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Hagelshaw of the Center for Commercial-Free Public  
Education in Oakland said the product placements were unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``We oppose any advertising in public schools that turn students  
into a captive audience,'' he said. ``You can make a textbook more 
relevant by saying bike without saying it's a Schwinn. You can say 
cookie without mentioning Oreos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	California's legislature is the first to complain about  
``Mathematics Applications and Connections,'' which has been the 
best seller in its category since it was introduced about six years 
ago, said Steve Weiss, a McGraw-Hill spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to California's reaction, new books minus the brand  
names already are being published, Weiss said.

<HEADLINE> Sears Makes Changes; Stock Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Sears, Roebuck and Co.'s stock plummeted 11  
percent today after the nation's second-largest retailer warned 
Wall Street that its third-quarter earnings would fall below 
expectations and announced a management shakeup. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears, still mired in a slump despite a series of changes aimed  
at reviving its business, disclosed the news as it reported 
disappointing sales for the month of August. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said today's announcement clearly signaled that the  
marketing and merchandising campaign Sears embarked on this year 
isn't yet paying off. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've clearly got to do something,'' said Jeffrey Edelman,  
an analyst for Paine Webber. ``It would appear the department 
stores need a lot of work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors apparently agreed. Sears stock was down $4.12 1/2 to  
$33.06 1/4 today on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur C. Martinez, chairman and chief executive officer,  
acknowledged the changes aren't working but said the latest moves 
show the company's ``commitment to re-energizing our sales.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shakeup came barely two weeks after the Hoffman Estates,  
Ill.-based company unveiled a more value-focused advertising 
campaign aimed at regaining some of the ground it has lost to 
discount and specialty retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears is also trying to offer more trendy clothing, is  
remodeling its stores and selling merchandise on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the company announced today that sales at stores  
open at least a year -- an industry gauge of performance -- rose a 
mere 0.1 percent in August. Sales were particularly weak in lawn 
and garden products, men's clothing and footwear. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears also said third-quarter earnings would be in the range of  
63 cents to 67 cents per share, less than the 82 cents that 
analysts were expecting. The retailer also said it is revising its 
full-year earnings outlook. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez's role in an overhauled Sears management was not fully  
defined, but analysts suggested it would give him more of a 
hands-on role in strategy, especially at the department stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez, however, will begin to share all corporate  
decision-making with two executives that will work with him in the 
newly created Office of the Chief Executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Alan J. Lacy, president of Sears Credit, will assume additional  
responsibilities as president of services. Julian C. Day, chief 
financial officer since March, was named to the new position of 
executive vice president and chief operating officer responsible 
for finance, logistics and information technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also announced the departure of the chief of  
merchandising for its full-line department stores, Robert Mettler. 
</P>
<P>
	With Mettler's departure, two presidents have been appointed to  
cover his responsibilities. Lyle Heidemann will be president of

electronics. Mark Cohen will be president of softlines, which 
includes all clothing and accessories.

<HEADLINE> British Telecom, AT&AMP;T Complete Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British Telecommunications PLC and AT&AMP;T Corp. have  
completed the purchase of a $1.9 billion stake in Japan Telecom 
Co., marking a further step in the consolidation of the global 
telephone industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which should strengthen the Japanese company's  
offering of phone and Internet services, was completed two months 
ahead of schedule, the companies said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the partnership arrangement, first announced in April, the  
British and U.S. companies together will own 30 percent of Japan 
Telecom, the third-largest long-distance phone company in Japan. BT 
and AT&AMP;T will each have 15 percent voting rights in the Japanese 
firm, said Phil Coathup, an AT&AMP;T spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The joint purchase is the first by BT and AT&AMP;T since the two  
companies announced plans last summer to form a $11 billion venture 
for selling services to multinational firms. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an important milestone. ... It positions us for strong  
growth in the data, mobile and Internet sectors in Japan,'' BT 
chief executive Sir Peter Bonfield said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	BT is Britain's biggest phone company, and AT&AMP;T is the largest  
long-distance and international carrier in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal comes in the wake of several other mergers and  
consolidations in the world's phone and Internet industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom, Germany's biggest telecommunications company,  
announced plans last month to pay $11.1 billion for the British 
mobile phone company One2One. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's Cable &AMP; Wireless Communications PLC agreed in July to  
sell its residential cable operations to rival NTL Inc. for about 
$10 billion. France Telecom expects to invest $5.5 billion in NTL 
to expand its foothold in Britain's cable market. 
</P>
<P>
	And in the United States, U S West Inc. is merging with Qwest  
Communications International Inc. in what could become a major 
rival to AT&AMP;T.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Envoy to IMF Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's special envoy to the International  
Monetary Fund and other foreign lenders resigned suddenly Thursday, 
saying he had ``fulfilled'' his mission and wanted to run for 
parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Mikhail Zadornov gave no indication that his resignation was  
connected to concerns that the IMF may delay new loans to Russia 
because of reports that previous IMF aid to Russia may have been 
illegally diverted through U.S. banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Zadornov insisted that all IMF aid had been used properly, and  
predicted the next loan would come as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was resigning to run for parliament in December's  
legislative elections as a candidate of the liberal Yabloko party. 
</P>
<P>
	A long-time member of the Russian Cabinet, Zadornov said his  
departure should not harm Russia's relations with the IMF, its 
biggest lender. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the last three months, we have succeeded in fully  
renewing our relations with international financial institutions,'' 
Zadornov told a news conference. ``I consider my mission 
fulfilled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zadornov, a former finance minister, helped negotiate the  
resumption of IMF aid to Russia after it was frozen in the wake of 
Russia's financial meltdown last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF renewed lending in July, and was expected to release  
$640 million of a $4.5 billion loan package this month. But the 
U.S. government -- the IMF's largest member -- said Wednesday it 
won't decide whether to approve new loans until a full accounting 
is made of the IMF money Russia has already received. 
</P>
<P>
	The hesitation comes amid reports that U.S. investigators  
believe Russian organized crime laundered billions of dollars 
through Western banks. Some reports have suggested that IMF money 
may have also been used in the transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Russian ruble fell against the U.S. dollar for a  
third day Thursday amid concerns that the IMF loan would be 
delayed. One dollar bought 25.79 rubles on the Moscow Interbank 
Currency Exchange, up from 25.4 rubles the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is the IMF's biggest borrower, with about $20 billion in  
lending since 1992. Moscow is seeking new loans to help pay off 
previous debts to the fund. 
</P>
<P>
	In other economic news Thursday, the Russian Statistics Agency  
said Russia's gross domestic product shrank by 1 percent in the 
first half of this year from the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The country's GDP totaled $72 billion in the first six months of  
the year, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's economy has shrunk every year since the collapse of the  
Soviet Union except for 1997, when it grew by less than one 
percent.

<HEADLINE> Jim Leyland Considers Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- After just one season on the job, Colorado Rockies  
manager Jim Leyland is talking about leaving, and the team's owners 
are hinting that he has already decided to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Leyland, disappointed with Rockies' poor performance, is  
considering retiring as a baseball manager altogether, according to 
Denver newspaper reports. After 35 years in professional baseball, 
Leyland said he no longer is certain he has the drive to lead a 
major league team. 
</P>
<P>
	Leyland told The Denver Post he has held recent discussions with  
Rockies owner Jerry McMorris about leaving at the end of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm seriously considering retiring from managing,'' Leyland  
said Wednesday, before an afternoon game against the Pittsburgh 
Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver Rocky Mountain News reported today that Leyland has  
already decided to retire. Leyland made his decision and met with 
McMorris when the team returned from its last road trip to inform 
him, according to the News. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has nothing to do with having trouble communicating with  
the players. I love my players on this team. And, believe me, it 
has nothing to do with the ownership of this team. I love this 
ownership,'' Leyland told the Post. ``My problem is simply a case 
of whether I have all the ingredients necessary to do everything it 
takes to do this job anymore. I just don't know. It's something I'm 
tossing and turning about every night. I just don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McMorris said he is aware that Leyland is unhappy.  
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't have any comment on Jim Leyland,'' he said.  
``Jim Leyland is our manager. Jim Leyland is frustrated. He has a 
three-year contract with the Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been talking to Jim Leyland about his frustrations for  
quite some time. It's really up to Jim Leyland to say what he has 
to say when he wants to do it. Jim has to make the decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies, who had high hopes of competing for a playoff spot  
this year, are in last place of the National League West. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Detroit Tigers and Los Angeles Dodgers both  
recruited Leyland before he joined the Rockies a year ago, he 
insisted his departure would indicate the end of a managerial 
career whose highlights have included more than 1,000 major league 
victories and a World Series championship with Florida in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I decide not to manage here in Colorado, I think that would  
be the end of it for me as a manager,'' Leyland said. ``I can 
assure you, I won't be going anywhere else to manage.''

<HEADLINE> Twins' Lawton, Fan Make Apologies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Minnesota Twins outfielder Matt Lawton has  
apologized, and will not be charged, after being caught on 
videotape spitting at a teen-age fan at the SkyDome. 
</P>
<P>
	``The investigation is over and done with,'' Sgt. David Bowen  
said. ``The two have exchanged letters that apologize to one 
another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The spat took place during the seventh inning of the Twins' 14-3  
victory over Toronto on Tuesday night. Lawton, while running down a 
foul ball, was heckled by several fans. When a 16-year old made a 
particularly insulting remark, Lawton spat towards him. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawton wouldn't say if it was a racial slur, but said it was  
``something like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been resolved,'' Lawton said. ``We wanted to apologize to  
the kid even though the tape shows I didn't spit on him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The incident was caught on videotape by TSN. The tape appears to  
show Lawton spitting toward the fan, but is inconclusive as to 
whether the fan was hit. The tape also shows the fan made what 
appeared to be an obscene gesture to Lawton before the spitting 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Sgt. Peter Harmsen said he received a call Wednesday  
night from the Twins telling him that they had settled the matter 
with the boy's family. He also talked to the boy, who said he would 
no longer press charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm satisfied there was an assault, but you need a complainant  
to go to court,'' Harmsen said.

<HEADLINE>  Serbs Block Road in Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRACANICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Angry Serbs blocked the main road  
in Gracanica today, protesting the disappearance of a Serb man two 
days ago and demanding that NATO troops protect them from their 
revenge-minded Albanian neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO troops said Serbs roughed up six people when they tried to  
drive through the village Wednesday afternoon. About 20 Serbs and a 
few Gyspies today stood beside vehicles preventing all but NATO 
vehicles from passing. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in London, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said today  
that British police in Kosovo have uncovered 50 bodies buried in a 
garbage dump. The latest discovery brings the number of bodies 
found by British forces and police in Kosovo to more than 200 in 
the last two months. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are currently carrying out the work of exhuming and  
documenting those bodies,'' Cook said. Evidence from the mass grave 
will be sent to the International War Crimes Tribunal, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Local Serbs said they erected the barricade in Gracanica on  
Wednesday after Milorad Popovic, 41, disappeared the day before 
while driving a truckload of lumber to a nearby village. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not only because of my husband,'' said Popovic's wife,  
Vesna. ``It's because of the way we have to live here now that we 
put up the barricades.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Popovic said she, her husband and two children came to  
Gracanica (pronounced GRA-cha-neet-zah) two months ago after ethnic 
Albanians drove them from their apartment in Pristina, four miles 
to the north. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the blockade would last ``until they find my husband.''  
</P>
<P>
	In Pristina, an Albanian doctor, Mehmet Maxhuni, said five  
Albanians and one Bulgarian woman, married to an Albanian, were 
pummeled at the barricade. NATO spokesman Maj. Roland Lavoie said 
six people were roughed up but none was seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Gracanica, in the British sector, is the site of a Serbian  
Orthodox monastery -- one of several religious shrines threatened by 
ethnic Albanians, the majority of whom are Muslim. A detachment of 
Irish Guards is stationed in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	The blockade is a further sign of ethnic divisions that have  
impeded efforts by the NATO-led peacekeeping force to bring peace 
to this province. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, NATO said a Gypsy family of four, was found dead of  
gunshot wounds Wednesday in Gornji Dragolevci, one mile southeast 
of Istok. 
</P>
<P>
	A Serb man was killed and another injured in an ambush Wednesday  
near Kosovska Mitrovica, NATO said. Late Wednesday, three Serbs 
were injured in a grenade attack on their house in the British 
sector, NATO added. 
</P>
<P>
	In Orahovac, where local Albanians have been blocking roads  
since Aug. 23, Kosovo's Albanian rebel leader endorsed efforts to 
prevent Russian peacekeepers from taking up positions there. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hasim Thaci, head of Kosovo's unofficial government, said  
during a visit there Wednesday that Russian troops might be allowed 
to deploy in the larger region. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians are part of the NATO-led international peacekeeping  
force, or KFOR, that entered Kosovo following NATO's bombing 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The Albanians claim Russian paramilitaries committed atrocities  
while stationed in Orahovac, 30 miles southwest of the provincial 
capital, Pristina, during the Serb-led crackdown on ethnic Albanian 
rebels in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant 
republic. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, no official decisions have been made on whether the  
Russians will replace Dutch peacekeepers in the region, as 
previously planned. Ethnic Albanians along the barricades, however, 
have been pitching tents, setting up makeshift shops and other 
measures to prepare for an indefinite standoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Wednesday, Bernard Kouchner, the top U.N. official in  
Kosovo, announced international police officers would be sent to 
Orahovac until the standoff is resolved.

<HEADLINE> Bills' Hansen Unrecognized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- For so long, he's been in the shadow of  
Bruce Smith. He hasn't starred in much highlight footage and his 
best seasons have come during Buffalo's post-Super Bowl years. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Phil Hansen, one of the NFL's steadiest defensive ends, is  
ready to go after a knee injury. But will anybody notice? 
</P>
<P>
	``I play the best I can,'' said Hansen, beginning his ninth year  
with the Bills. ``If recognition comes, great. If it doesn't, play 
harder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hansen plays hard. He ranks third on the team with 50.5 career  
sacks, behind Smith with 164 and Cornelius Bennett (52.5). But more 
telling are Hansen's 694 career tackles. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, Phil doesn't get double digits in sacks,'' Smith said  
Thursday. ``He'll get his eight or nine. But he'll get near 100 
tackles, sometimes a lot more, and that's a hell of an effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Showing no trace of the knee injury that sidelined him for the  
last two games last season, including a playoff loss to Miami, he 
had three sacks in last week's exhibition win against Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	With Smith grabbing the spotlight and gargantuan Ted Washington  
clogging the middle, Hansen has a way of getting lost. 
</P>
<P>
	``The underrated thing will always be Phil's handle, I guess,''  
Buffalo coach Wade Phillips said. ``But Phil is poised to have a 
good year. You can see his play on the field was outstanding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've enjoyed having him as my other bookend,'' said Smith, who  
played in his 11th Pro Bowl last season and trails only Reggie 
White in NFL career sacks. ``There are some who shine a little bit 
more, but I'd rather play beside Phil than about 75 percent of the 
defensive ends in the league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hansen relies on a work ethic he learned while growing up on the  
family farm in North Dakota. He tries to avoid interviews and is 
modest to the point of self-effacement. 
</P>
<P>
	But the biggest reason he doesn't get much recognition is  
simple: He's not involved in enough high-profile plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, it's all based on sacks,'' Phillips said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hansen's career high of 10 sacks came in 1995. The last three  
seasons he totaled 21.5 sacks and was well above or close to 100 
tackles each of the last four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Steady and reliable doesn't win votes. But it does make people  
miss you when you're gone. 
</P>
<P>
	Hansen sprained his right knee in a 17-10 loss to the Jets last  
December when a teammate landed on him. Hansen recalls being 
surprised at the severity of the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I could go back in and play,'' he said. The team  
doctor told him to sit. 
</P>
<P>
	He grimaces at the injury, not the pain but the circumstance.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was on an extra point,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The injury ended Hansen's team-high streak of 86 straight starts  
dating to 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a long offseason,'' he said. ``I knew I wouldn't be  
able to test the knee until training camp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Hansen felt so good on the first day of camp, he forgot  
about his knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Afterward I said, hey, my knee is OK,'' Hansen said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hansen has been better than OK since. He and Smith combine with  
nose tackle Washington to give Buffalo one of the best defensive 
lines in football. 
</P>
<P>
	They have the support of some of the best linebackers in the  
business. And perhaps Doug Flutie can lead them back to the super 
Bowl. That would please Hansen like nothing else. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I didn't believe we could get there,'' he said. ``I  
wouldn't be here.''

<HEADLINE>  No Celebration Among New Umps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Phil Cuzzi became a full-time big league  
umpire Thursday, something he's worked toward since he began his 
professional career 14 years ago. He was in no mood to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult,'' he said before the Phillies-Giants' game,  
which had three newcomers on its four-man crew. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have the plate today,'' Cuzzi said. ``'m going out to work  
the best that I can. I don't know what to expect from the other 
guys. We have a young guy coming up from Triple A. He's never 
worked a game in the big leagues before. It's just hard that he 
would have to look to me as an experienced guy. I'm not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuzzi, 44, of Nutley, N.J., was among 25 minor league umpires  
hired by major league baseball in the aftermath of the umpire 
union's failed strategy of mass resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuzzi said he spent Wednesday evening with Paul Nauert, a rookie  
umpire who was among the 22 whose resignations were accepted. 
Nauert flew back home Wednesday night and his place was taken by 
Jim Wolf, a minor league ump who was called up for the day to work 
his first big league game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think his head was still spinning,'' Cuzzi said of Nauert.  
``He's hopeful, as we all are, that the arbitration process will 
bring him back on the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others in the crew were Alfonso Marquez at first base, also a  
new hire, and eight-year veteran Brian Gorman at second. Wolf is 
the brother of Phillies pitcher Randy Wolf. NL senior vice 
president Katy Feeney said the league would make sure the umpire, 
who may get more fill-in work this season, doesn't work the plate 
in games his brother is scheduled to start. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have butterflies big-time,'' Jim Wolf said. ``I've got a  
swarm in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Wolf, who worked third base, said his big moment was  
tarnished by the simmering dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a really awkward situation,'' he said. ``It's put  
all minor league umpires in an awkward situation. It's a really 
unfortunate thing that happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuzzi, a fill-in big league umpire for the last eight years, had  
similar feeling. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first year in the minor leagues was 1985,'' said Cuzzi who  
began his pro career in the New York-Penn League. ``You wait for 
this day. ... I never ever expected when I got a chance to be a 
fulltime member of the staff that it would be under these 
circumstances. So in that sense, there is a cloud overhead and it 
is disappointing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuzzi said he wasn't bitter toward union chief Richie Phillips,  
who promoted the failed strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Richie Phillips was ever really the issue,'' he  
said. ``The problem was that the union started to splinter. If 
everyone would have stuck together, I don't think we'd be in the 
situation we are in now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He acknowledged there probably would be resentment among veteran  
umps who followed Phillips' strategy and those who broke with the 
union. 
</P>
<P>
	``How could there not be?'' Cuzzi said. ``But once we walk on  
the field, everyone is a member of the crew, regardless of what 
their feelings are off the field. When we're on the field, we work 
together. We'll go from there.''

<HEADLINE>  No Celebration Among New Umps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Phil Cuzzi became a full-time big league  
umpire Thursday, something he's worked toward since he began his 
professional career 14 years ago. He was in no mood to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult,'' he said before the Phillies-Giants' game,  
which had three newcomers on its four-man crew. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have the plate today,'' Cuzzi said. ``'m going out to work  
the best that I can. I don't know what to expect from the other 
guys. We have a young guy coming up from Triple A. He's never 
worked a game in the big leagues before. It's just hard that he 
would have to look to me as an experienced guy. I'm not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuzzi, 44, of Nutley, N.J., was among 25 minor league umpires  
hired by major league baseball in the aftermath of the umpire 
union's failed strategy of mass resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuzzi said he spent Wednesday evening with Paul Nauert, a rookie  
umpire who was among the 22 whose resignations were accepted. 
Nauert flew back home Wednesday night and his place was taken by 
Jim Wolf, a minor league ump who was called up for the day to work 
his first big league game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think his head was still spinning,'' Cuzzi said of Nauert.  
``He's hopeful, as we all are, that the arbitration process will 
bring him back on the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others in the crew were Alfonso Marquez at first base, also a  
new hire, and eight-year veteran Brian Gorman at second. Wolf is 
the brother of Phillies pitcher Randy Wolf. NL senior vice 
president Katy Feeney said the league would make sure the umpire, 
who may get more fill-in work this season, doesn't work the plate 
in games his brother is scheduled to start. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have butterflies big-time,'' Jim Wolf said. ``I've got a  
swarm in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Wolf, who worked third base, said his big moment was  
tarnished by the simmering dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a really awkward situation,'' he said. ``It's put  
all minor league umpires in an awkward situation. It's a really 
unfortunate thing that happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuzzi, a fill-in big league umpire for the last eight years, had

</P>

this day. ... I never ever expected when I got a chance to be a

<HEADLINE> Regulation Part of NYSE Public Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Stock Exchange board members are  
considering creation of a new regulatory structure that would 
separate the exchange's marketplace from its enforcement arm under 
plans to take the exchange public. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission, which  
enforces federal securities laws at the United States stock 
exchanges, have raised concerns over how the Big Board will police 
itself as a publicly traded organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE board was set to meet today to discuss a possible  
initial public offering of stock, or IPO. 
</P>
<P>
	The exchange currently is a self-regulating organization,  
imposing fines and suspensions on members who break its rules and 
cheat investors. The main concern, according to officials at the 
Securities and Exchange Commission, is that such regulation could 
slip as a priority if the NYSE becomes more focused on turning a 
profit and improving share price than in policing its members. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE announced in July it was considering going public to  
raise money to better compete with upstart electronic trading 
networks. The Nasdaq Stock Market, the second largest after the 
NYSE, also is considering an IPO. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE has yet to submit a proposal to the SEC on how it might  
restructure its regulatory arm. But the plan is expected to closely 
mirror the structure now used by the National Association of 
Securities Dealers, which acts as the parent company for two 
independent but affiliated units -- the Nasdaq Stock Market and NASD 
Regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Talks between the New York Stock Exchange and the SEC have  
been very productive to this point and we believe they embrace our 
notion that some separation of the market and the self-regulatory 
function is appropriate,'' Annette Nazareth, director of the SEC's 
market regulation division, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The Big Board, like other stock exchanges, currently polices its  
members itself through its status as a self-regulating 
organization, or SRO. Under the SRO structure, the NYSE creates its 
own regulation policies and enforces them through an in-house 
regulatory unit. 
</P>
<P>
	The job of the SEC, which enforces federal securities laws at  
all U.S. stock exchanges, is to make sure the NYSE's regulations 
conform with federal standards. In addition, the SEC must approve 
any regulatory changes proposed by the exchange, and is authorized 
to inspect the NYSE's operations to ensure compliance. 
</P>
<P>
	None of that would change if the Big Board goes forward with an  
IPO. What would change is that the NYSE would suddenly be 
accountable to profit-seeking shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rap on SROs in general is that they are owned by their  
members and there's an inherent tension between the members and the 
regulatory arm. The members want the regulatory people to take it 
easy on them,'' said Bruce Baird, a Washington, D.C., securities 
lawyer and former head of the securities fraud unit for the U.S. 
Attorney's Office in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that conflict would even be greater if the exchange was  
accountable to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt raised the issue publicly in a letter  
shortly after the NYSE announced in July it is considering shifting 
from a private, member-owned entity to a publicly owned company. 
</P>
<P>
	Another concern is whether an exchange can be trusted to monitor  
trading in its own shares. ``Can they police the trading of their 
own stock?'' asked James Angel, an associate professor of finance 
at Georgetown University. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE and Nasdaq believe going public will give them the  
flexibility to compete with low-cost electronic trading networks, 
known as ECNs. 
</P>
<P>
	Both markets have said the stock created in an IPO could be used  
to buy or team-up with an ECN. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE board members are also expected today to discuss the  
exchange's membership structure in the event of an IPO. One idea 
floated has members receiving stock in exchange for their seats on 
the exchange. But that plan could be scuttled by members who don't 
want to pay the capital gains taxes that would be assessed on that 
type of stock transaction.

<HEADLINE> Possible Sister Act Looms at Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When the U.S. Tennis Association held its draw  
for the U.S. Open, No. 3 Venus Williams wound up in the top half 
and No. 7 Serena Williams landed in the bottom half. 
</P>
<P>
	Some tournaments have all the luck.  
</P>
<P>
	The blind draw created the possibility of an all-Williams final,  
something their father, Richard, predicted was going to happen all 
along. Right now, papa's prediction is right on target. 
</P>
<P>
	The Williams siblings have been down this road before. In March,  
Venus beat Serena in three sets at the finals of the Lipton, the 
first time sisters have met in a WTA Tour final. This, though, is 
the Open, a much larger stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Sister Serena reached the third round Thursday, stopping Jelena  
Kostanic 6-4, 6-2. Venus got a third-round walkover when Henrieta 
Nagyova withdrew because of an injured right wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Serena Williams did not like the way she played against  
Kostanic, 
</P>
<P>
	``I really made way too many errors,'' she said. ``I was pretty  
erratic and not playing that great. But I came out with the big 
`W''' 
</P>
<P>
	Three more wins for Venus and four more for Serena and their  
father will face the toughest of circumstances -- picking between 
his daughters in the finals of the year's last Grand Slam. 
</P>
<P>
	This, of course, assumes considerable cooperation from  
top-seeded Martina Hingis, defending champion Lindsay Davenport and 
nine-time Grand Slam champion Monica Seles, among others. 
</P>
<P>
	Details, details, details.  
</P>
<P>
	Hingis got a little indignant over the ambitious prediction and  
popped off about it the other day, saying something about the 
Williams clan having big mouths. Serena, armed with a disarming 
smile, seemed at first uninterested in getting into a battle of 
words with the No. 1 player in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	And then she did anyway.  
</P>
<P>
	``She's always the type of person who says things, just speaks  
her mind,'' Williams said. ``I guess it has a little bit to do with 
not having a formal education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ouch!  
</P>
<P>
	``But you just have to somehow think more,'' Williams continued.  
``You have to use your brain more in the tennis world. She does 
that well on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's her opinion and she's entitled to her own opinion. She  
can say whatever she would like. I personally don't think my mouth 
is big if you're looking at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams then poked away at Hingis some more, talking about  
personal priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was No. 1 when she was 16,'' Serena said. ``That's  
something I've never done. I still haven't won a Grand Slam and 
she's won five. She's pursued other things. I'm pursuing education. 
I'm catching up in tennis, though.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams is studying Portuguese and wants to learn Spanish next.  
``I always try to keep my brain focused on something.,'' she said. 
``I don't like to get too much involved with a lot of nonsense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She will be attending an art school for fashion design in Fort  
Lauderdale, Fla., this fall, taking psychology courses as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I can help some of you guys,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	At 17, Serena sees tennis as a temporary stopover.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can't see myself 10 years from now, in here,'' she said.  
``But I know Steffi Graf, when she was younger, said the same 
thing, and she was here 10 years later. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I really don't know. I mean right now I can't see it, but  
I'm not going to have a myopic view and say I'm not going to be 
here because you never know in the future.''

<HEADLINE> Second Russian Bank Employee Fired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Bank of New York on Thursday dismissed a  
second employee amid a probe into whether the bank's accounts were 
used by Russian mobsters and others to launder billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Svetlana Kudryavtsev, an associate in the bank's Eastern  
European division, was fired for failing to cooperate with an 
internal investigation, a source familiar with the matter said. 
</P>
<P>
	A bank spokesman would only confirm that Ms. Kudryavtsev had  
been fired, and did not provide a reason. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Friday, the bank fired Lucy Edwards, a London-based vice  
president, for gross misconduct, violation of the bank's internal 
policies, falsification of bank records and failure to cooperate 
with the bank's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement authorities are looking into allegations that up  
to $10 billion was laundered through the bank's accounts by Russian 
organized crime and other figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank had earlier suspended Ms. Edwards along with another  
executive, Natasha Kagalovsky, who supervised the bank's business 
in Eastern Europe from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kagalovsky has denied any wrongdoing. So far no one has been  
charged with any crime in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank clearly is troubled that its name has been associated  
with the scandal. On Monday, bank chairman Thomas A. Renyi sent a 
memo to employees defending the institution's reputation and 
promising ``prompt action'' if any inappropriate action by bank 
staff was discovered.

<HEADLINE> Scripps Howard Funding Fellowships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- The Scripps Howard Foundation will provide  
funding to the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism to 
give scholarships to four international students a year beginning 
this fall, the foundation announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The fellowships will be named for the late Jack R. Howard, a  
founding trustee and past president of the Scripps Howard 
Foundation. He was also president and general editorial manager of 
The E.W. Scripps Co., parent company of the Scripps Howard 
newspapers and television station group. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati-based foundation supports journalism education  
and internships, literacy programs, First Amendment causes and 
minority recruitment and development. 
</P>
<P>
	The journalism school's international program admits about 40  
students each year from more than 20 countries. Many qualified 
candidates are unable to attend because of limited financial aid, 
school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jack R. Howard Fellowships will provide more than $40,000  
per student for full tuition and living expenses, foundation 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	To qualify for the fellowship, candidates must live outside the  
United States. Recipients will be selected on the basis of 
financial need and academic promise. 
</P>
<P>
	Foundation officials said they hope the students will return  
home and contribute to the development of journalism in their 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The students selected to receive scholarships for the 1999-2000  
academic year are Nguyen My Ha, Vietnam; Yiva Norberg, Sweden; 
Alfredo Sepulveda, Chile; and Alieu Sheriff, Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Biggest Insurer Covers New Pap Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A reversal by the nation's largest health  
insurer will give millions of women access to new types of Pap 
tests believed to be better, albeit more expensive, screening 
methods for cervical cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna Inc. on Thursday agreed to cover the ThinPrep Pap Test,  
which federal officials in 1996 said was more effective in 
detecting early signs of cervical cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, a top Aetna official said ThinPrep was not worth the  
extra cost, usually an additional $15 per test. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna now says new, as yet unpublished studies show ThinPrep  
increases the detection of abnormal or precancerous cells. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to ThinPrep, Aetna said it will cover a similar  
test, PREP, made by AutoCyte, and an automated Pap test in which a 
computer, rather than a laboratory technician, scans Pap smear 
slides. 
</P>
<P>
	The coverage begins immediately.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's about time,'' said Dr. Peter Grossman, an  
obstetrician/gynecologist in Augusta, Ga. ``Aetna held out as long 
as they could, but as more studies show this is a more accurate 
test and more insurers come on board, there's a lot of peer 
pressure in the industry to cover the test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For patients, it will significantly reduce the chances that  
their Pap test will miss an abnormality,'' he said. Further, the 
ThinPrep lets doctors use the same sample to test for the presence 
of the HPV virus, which is known to cause cervical cancer, Grossman 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna's U.S. Healthcare unit, based in Blue Bell, Pa., provides  
health insurance to 21 million Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that it is best to have the treating physician make  
the decision'' about which type of Pap test to use, said Dr. Arnold 
Cohen, an obstetrician-gynecologist in charge of Aetna's women's 
health programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Insurance coverage is crucial because ThinPrep typically costs  
$25 to $30 per test compared to $7 to $10 for the conventional Pap 
test. Aetna said its costs would increase as a result of the new 
coverage, but said it was too early to estimate the amount. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna joins most of the major health insurers to cover ThinPrep,  
which was approved in 1996 but has struggled until recently to 
build demand. The only major insurer not to cover the test is 
Kaiser Permanente, the nation's second-largest health maintenance 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	A Kaiser official said last month that the company is looking  
into covering the newer test. 
</P>
<P>
	About 13 percent of the 50 million Pap smears performed in the  
United States are now done with ThinPrep, which is made by Cytyc 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	ThinPrep makes it easier for lab technicians to interpret Pap  
smears and as a result find more abnormal or precancerous cells. 
</P>
<P>
	ThinPrep treats the cells with a liquid to remove blood and  
mucus that can hide cancerous changes. In November 1996, the 
federal government agreed that the Thin Prep system is more than 65 
percent more effective in diagnosing precancerous cells, which can 
lead to cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Named for Dr. George Papanicolaou, the pathologist who developed  
it in 1948, the Pap smear involves a doctor scraping cells from the 
cervix, at the neck of the uterus. 
</P>
<P>
	The cells are smeared onto a glass slide and sent to a lab,  
where a technician reads the slide under a microscope. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Pap smear is far from infallible. It misses problems  
about 20 percent of the time, according to the National Institutes 
of Health, usually because of poor cervical samples or difficulty 
reading the slides at the lab. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a big deal,'' said Tom Gunderson, an analyst at Piper  
Jaffray, said of Aetna's decision. ``It is not only nice for Aetna 
and its customers, but is a tremendous boon for Cytyc's 
psychology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many doctors and health insurers initially were hesitant to  
replace the conventional diagnostic test that led to a big drop in 
cervical cancer deaths with a pricier version. Critics claimed that 
the new test was no better than the conventional one at identifying 
cancer, and argued ThinPrep would result in too many false 
warnings, thus unnecessarily alarming patients. 
</P>
<P>
	ThinPrep's increasing market share comes as Cytyc, based in  
Boxborough, Mass., has convinced more big health insurers -- 
including several Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans -- that the new 
test is worth the extra expense. Other major insurers that cover 
ThinPrep include United HealthCare, Cigna and Foundation Health. 
Another major insurer, Humana, provides partial coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna's Cohen said the new studies show ThinPrep helps detect  
more serious abnormal cells, which have a strong likelihood of 
becoming cancerous. He said older studies involved too few women, 
and showed the test only detected the type of abnormal cells that 
most likely would not become cancerous.

<HEADLINE> Army Demotes Ret. Maj. Gen. Hale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army took the highly unusual action  
Thursday of demoting a retired general who admitted during his 
court-martial last spring that he had adulterous affairs with the 
wives of four subordinates. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer, David Hale, vowed to challenge the decision in  
federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	Army Secretary Louis Caldera reduced Hale's rank from a two-star  
major general to a one-star brigadier general. Hale, 53, was once a 
top commander of NATO forces in southern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale's attorney, Frank Spinner, issued a statement on Hale's  
behalf calling Caldera's action an ``unprecedented abuse of 
power.'' Spinner also said Caldera had acted in response to a 
``media campaign built on outrageous lies and outright deception.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Secretary Caldera is literally making up the rules as he goes  
along,'' Spinner said, adding that he knows of no other case in 
which the Army has demoted an officer after retirement. ``It is my 
belief that Congress never authorized the secretaries of the Army, 
Air Force and Navy to take this kind of action against a retired 
officer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By Caldera's action, Hale's current retirement pay of $6,250 a  
month will be reduced by about $750 a month. That cut is 
retroactive to Hale's retirement date of March 1, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Army lawyers said it will be up to the Defense Department's  
Finance and Accounting Service to decide whether to seek 
reimbursement from Hale for a portion of the pay he has collected 
since retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army said Hale's only option for appealing the decision  
would be to petition the Army Board for Correction of Military 
Records. 
</P>
<P>
	Donnamaria Carpino, one of the women Hale had sex with, issued a  
statement endorsing the Army's action. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am pleased that the Army has come to the stunning revelation  
that a court-martialed general should not retain all of his 
stars,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Olympia J. Snowe, R-Maine, who wrote to Caldera in July  
urging that Hale's rank be reduced, said she was pleased the Army 
secretary ``closed the Hale case on a high note of justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This proportionate punishment sends a clear signal that the  
enforcement of regulations against sexual harassment must remain 
blind to rank or privilege,'' the senator said. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera acted on the unanimous recommendation of a panel of  
three active-duty generals convened in August to determine whether 
Hale should be allowed to keep his two-star rank. 
</P>
<P>
	When allegations of sexual misconduct surfaced in 1998, Hale  
denied them and even sued one of his accusers. At his court-martial 
last March he admitted to the charges and tearfully apologized for 
his actions. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale was reprimanded and fined after the court-martial, but he  
was allowed to retire with honor and escape a possible 11-year term 
in a military prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale was the highest-ranking Army officer to face court-martial  
since 1952. His sexual misconduct occurred while he worked in the 
NATO command in southern Europe. The resulting furor led the 
Pentagon to change its rules to bar top officers from retiring 
while facing allegations of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army also decided to take the highly unusual step of  
court-martialing Hale even though he had retired a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other case in which an Army general faced court-martial  
since Congress enacted the Uniform Code of Military Justice in 1951 
was in 1952, when Maj. Gen. Robert Grow, military attache in 
Moscow, was tried on charges of dereliction of duty. Grow was 
reprimanded and suspended from command for six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale pled guilty to seven counts of conduct unbecoming an  
officer and one count of lying to investigators. He was ordered to 
pay a $10,000 fine and forfeit $12,000 of his $75,744 annual 
pension for one year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Carpino said she is awaiting an Army decision about whether  
to reimburse her for the $26,000 she spent defending herself 
against a defamation suit filed by Hale last year in which he 
denied he had an adulterous relationship with her. Hale later 
withdrew the lawsuit and admitted to the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	An Army official said discussions were underway on possible  
forms of financial compensation to Ms. Carpino.

<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- The Golden State Warriors re-signed  
veteran forward Terry Cummings to a multiyear contract on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old Cummings has averaged 16.6 points and 7.3

<HEADLINE>  Ripken Hits 400th Homer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Cal Ripken hit his 400th career home run  
Thursday night, joining an exclusive circle of sluggers whose 
membership now stands at 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken connected off right-hander Rolando Arrojo in the third  
inning of the Baltimore Orioles' game against the Tampa Bay Devil 
Rays. The three-run homer, on a 1-1 pitch, landed in the left-field 
seats and set off a wild celebration at Camden Yards. 
</P>
<P>
	As Ripken rounded the bases, the scoreboard scrolled a list of  
all his home runs. He was greeted warmly by his teammates in the 
dugout, then came out and tipped his batting helmet to the standing 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd remained on their feet as the Devil Rays made a  
pitching change. Ripken used the delay to wave again to the 
appreciative crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	The shot, estimated at 372 feet, was his 16th homer of the  
season and first since July 25. He spent a month on the disabled 
list with nerve irritation in his lower back before being activated 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken returned from his second stint on the DL intent upon  
blocking out all thoughts about hitting No. 400 and moving closer 
to his 3,000th hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always try to downplay that,'' he said. ``The home runs, I'm  
tickled to death that I'm able to contribute and have that kind of 
success. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they come, they come and I'll be very happy about it. If  
they don't come, my career won't be any less fulfilling as a result 
of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he admitted to trying to hit one out in his last home game  
before going on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to hit a home run because I thought it would be great  
to do it here at home,'' he said. ``I was able to concentrate and 
put a good swing on the ball. But it seemed to take me out of my 
game a little bit, trying to swing hard and hit a home run every 
time. You can't hit a home run by swinging for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The home run gave Ripken 2,969 career hits. If he gets No. 3000,  
he will gain entry into an even tighter fraternity of hitters: 
those with 3,000 hits and 400 homers. 
</P>
<P>
	The only players to accomplish the feat are Hank Aaron, Willie  
Mays, Eddie Murray, Stan Musial, Dave Winfield and Carl 
Yastrzemski. Ripken and Yastrzemski would be the only ones on the 
list to play their entire career in the American League. 
</P>
<P>
	When it comes to durability, however, Ripken stands alone. His  
consecutive games streak of 2,632 games, which he voluntarily ended 
last season, is the longest such run in baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
	The 39-year-old Ripken hit his first homer on April 5, 1982,  
against Kansas City's Dennis Leonard. At the time, Ripken was 21. 
</P>
<P>
	He hit No. 100 off Texas' Dickie Noles on Aug. 15, 1985; No. 200  
on Aug. 21, 1989, against Milwaukee's Mark Knudson; and reached 300 
with a three-run shot against Milwaukee's Teddy Higuera on May 24, 
1994, at age 33. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken has homered against five Hall of Famers: Tom Seaver (3  
times); Don Sutton (3); Phil Neikro (2); Nolan Ryan (2); and 
Gaylord Perry (1).

<HEADLINE> Therapist Found Negligent in Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WAUSAU, Wis. (AP) -- A therapist was found negligent on Thursday  
for leading a woman to believe she was molested by her father, that 
her parents were in a baby-killing cult and that she had 75 
personalities. She was awarded $850,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my view, there is no defense for this kind of therapy. If  
that means that this is now a message that this stuff has to stop, 
I hope the message is delivered,'' said William Smoler, an attorney 
for Joan Hess and her family. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Juan Fernandez III declined to comment as he left the  
courtroom wearing a necktie that featured a drawing of Daffy Duck. 
</P>
<P>
	Repressed-memory therapy contends victims of childhood trauma  
can forget the abuse for decades, and it can be the source of adult 
disorders. Recovering the memories can cure the disorders. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hess, 47, the ex-wife of former Wausau Mayor John Hess,  
contended none of the horrors her therapy revealed actually 
occurred, and that she was permanently harmed by the ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	She contended some of the personalities caused her to threaten  
suicide, forcing her to be hospitalized numerous times. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys argued that Mrs. Hess believed there was  
something bad in her past before she began treatment with 
Fernandez, and that Fernandez acted as a responsible psychiatrist 
would to help her. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. Fernandez did what good psychiatrists do,'' defense  
attorney Paul Grimstad said. ``He followed his training and he 
followed the textbook.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trial lasted 15 weeks, and included testimony from  
psychiatrists on repressed-memory therapy, hypnosis, and multiple 
personality disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury deliberated for 25 hours before finding that Fernandez  
was negligent for his care and treatment of Mrs. Hess, his failure 
to explain the riskiness of the treatment, and for failing to get 
her consent for the therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hess began treatment with Fernandez in 1991, when she was  
being treated for depression. The care continued until 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez's attorney, Tom Rusboldt, said he was unsure about an  
appeal, or what the decision would mean to Fernandez's career. The 
state agency that licenses doctors will be notified of the verdict, 
Rusboldt said.

<HEADLINE> Measles May Be Wiped Out in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The United States has all but stamped out  
measles, recording only 100 cases last year -- the lowest number on 
record -- with most of the infections brought into the country from 
abroad, the government said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said all but 29  
of those cases involved, directly or indirectly, people who became 
infected in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The numbers suggest that measles has joined the ranks of  
smallpox, polio, diphtheria and other diseases that have been 
effectively wiped out in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we didn't have importation, we wouldn't have measles in the  
United States,'' said Dr. Mark Papania, the CDC's acting chief of 
measles elimination. ``We're kind of saying it cautiously. We're 
not quite making a declaration. But the best information we now 
have is saying measles is no longer indigenous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before a vaccine became available in 1963, nearly every American  
child would get the measles by the mid-teens. 
</P>
<P>
	At its known peak, in 1941, measles infected 894,134 Americans  
and killed 2,279, according to the Public Health Service. 
</P>
<P>
	It's one of the most contagious diseases known, often likened to  
chicken pox but with more severe effects. Measles causes high fever 
and a red rash that spreads over the entire body. Infections can 
cause permanent injuries, including blindness and brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was perceived as a serious disease,'' Papania said. ``It  
wasn't the Black Plague or anything, but people knew that people 
could die from it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Infections dropped dramatically after a vaccine was introduced  
and states passed laws requiring children to be immunized before 
they enter school. Officials estimate 90 percent of children are 
immunized by age 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Measles still kills roughly 1 million people worldwide each  
year. About half of those deaths occur in central Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Even in the United States, the disease surged between 1989 and  
1991, infecting 55,000 Americans and killing 120. Researchers said 
the outbreak was fueled by foreign carriers infecting preschool-age 
children who had not been immunized and youngsters who did not 
develop immunity from a single dose of the vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
	Now health officials recommend two doses of the vaccine,  
something required by more than half the states.

<HEADLINE> Gore Says Protect U.S. Shorelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore announced new initiatives  
Thursday designed to protect the country's shorelines and oceans 
and promised federal help for struggling New England fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling for ``bold steps'' to protect the oceans, the Democratic  
presidential front-runner said, ``They're not just part of the 
environment, but they're an engine of our economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore announced that President Clinton had signed a proclamation  
Thursday giving American authorities the right to enforce 
environmental, customs and immigration laws at sea within 24 
nautical miles from shore, up from 12 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's going to greatly increase our ability to protect our  
environment,'' said Gore, who also noted the measure would help 
authorities fight drug smugglers. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to his speech at the aquarium, Gore cruised the harbor  
with teen-agers who showed him tubs full of shellfish, seaweed and 
other marine life, helped him perform tests on the water's clarity 
and even gave him a net to catch tiny plankton. He discussed with 
them some of his environmental thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
	He announced $5 million in aid to help fishermen suffering from  
declining fish populations and fisheries closures in the Gulf of 
Maine. In return for the money, fishermen must agree to work with 
scientists conducting research on the health of the fish stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``No plan is worth anything unless it protects those working  
families who depend on a healthy ocean,'' Gore said. ``I think that 
a clean and safe environment is the foundation for a prosperous 
economy and a good way of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his remarks, Gore never mentioned his run for the White  
House. But with the formerly filthy Boston Harbor as his backdrop, 
Thursday's event allowed him to highlight what is often seen as one 
of his strongest policy areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``People said we couldn't act to clean up this harbor, but we  
have,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	He endorsed a report, signed by Navy Secretary Richard Danzig  
and Commerce Secretary William Daley, that proposes U.S. membership 
in the United Nations' 1994 Convention on the Law of the Sea, which 
sets international standards for the world's oceans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're the only major player in the world that's not part of  
that,'' said Jerry Schubel, president of the New England Aquarium. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also urged increased research and monitoring of  
marine wildlife, a look at the possible establishment of marine 
wilderness areas, and new research on ways in which the 
environmental impact of offshore oil and gas operations could be 
reduced. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said a task force of officials from varying federal  
agencies would work on strategies for implementing the report's 
recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger McManus, president of the Washington-based Center for  
Marine Conservation, called the plan ``a real attempt to protect 
oceans like we protect parts of lands.

<HEADLINE> Fed Workers Told To Report Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Thousands of federal workers for the  
Energy Department have been told to report liaisons -- romantic or 
otherwise -- with people from countries thought to be developing 
nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	A notice sent out last month requires 67,000 workers cleared to  
handle defense secrets to report sexual encounters, friendships or 
professional relationships with any foreign national if they spend 
``private time'' together -- even on the Internet -- or if either one 
shares information about their personal or professional lives. 
</P>
<P>
	The countries include all former Soviet republics, China,  
Israel, India, North Korea, Cuba and Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	Top-security workers don't have to report one-time sexual  
contact with a foreign national from listed countries as long as 
they are not prying for classified information. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign intelligence agencies sometimes use young women to tease  
secrets from American scientists during pillow talk or other 
romantic liaisons, said Ed Curran, counterintelligence chief for 
the Energy Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is done on a daily basis today,'' Curran, who wrote the  
Aug. 17 memo, said in a story published Wednesday in the 
Albuquerque Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many, many cases of this,'' he said. ``The 50-,  
60-year-old person stationed overseas for months, away from family 
and children, that person could be especially vulnerable to this 
kind of effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Similar reporting policies are in place at the FBI, the CIA, the  
National Security Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency and the 
Department of Defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Dannieskiold, a spokesman for Los Alamos National Laboratory  
in northern New Mexico, said the policy was not a big deal and was 
not even a topic of conversation among employees. 
</P>
<P>
	But the document, widely circulated at Los Alamos lab in the  
wake of congressional and DOE allegations of Chinese spying, 
prompted some jokes. 
</P>
<P>
	A scientist who provided a copy to the Los Alamos Monitor said:  
``Apparently, it's all right to sleep with someone -- once -- but if 
you buy a car from her, you have to report it.''

<HEADLINE> Former Fed Judge Dies At 79 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) -- Almeric L.  
Christian, the first native of the U.S. Virgin Islands to be named 
a judge in the territory's District Court, has died at age 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Christian died Wednesday at a hospital in nearby Puerto Rico of  
an undisclosed illness, a written statement from the territory's 
governor, Charles Turnbull, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Christian was appointed by President Richard Nixon in 1969 and  
retired in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	His most controversial decisions were in two 1970s cases, in  
which he ruled that immigrants' children had a right to public 
education. 
</P>
<P>
	``Judge Christian made a profound impact on the judicial, social  
and political history of the Virgin Islands,'' Turnbull's statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Christian died one day after his 36th wedding anniversary to his  
wife, Shirley, who survives him. 
</P>
<P>
	He is also survived by a son, Adam, and daughters Rebecca  
Christian and Donna Christian-Christensen, who is the Virgin 
Islands' nonvoting delegate to the U.S. Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	His mother, Elena L. Christian, also survives him and is 103.  
</P>
<P>
	His funeral will be next Wednesday on the Caribbean island of  
St. Croix, the government said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Automakers Report Higher Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- With low prices and buyers flush with cash, the  
U.S. auto industry seems poised to blaze past its previous record 
for yearly sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Another piece of evidence arrived Thursday, when Ford Motor Co.  
said its U.S. sales had gone up 5 percent last month over August 
1998. Car sales jumped 11.5 percent, an increase Ford said was due 
in part to better fleet sales. Light truck sales were up 0.5 
percent compared to last year, when the automaker took advantage of 
a strike that wiped out much of General Motors Corp.'s truck 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the Ford Explorer and Expedition and Mercury  
Mountaineer sport utility vehicles set sales records for the month. 
That offset lower sales of the popular Ford Ranger and F-Series 
pickups, a problem Ford said was due to production line changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``August was another sensational month for Ford and the  
industry,'' said Bob Rewey, Ford's group vice president of 
marketing, sales and service. ``The conventional wisdom seems to be 
this is as good as it gets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overall U.S. sales were up 20 percent. August's sales were at a  
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 17.8 million light vehicles, 
compared to a 14.8 million rate last year, according to Michigan 
research firm Morgan &AMP; Co. For the year through August, sales were 
at an annual rate of 16.9 million vehicles -- far more than the 
record of about 16.1 million in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Several economic conditions -- low unemployment, low inflation,  
low interest rates -- have combined to keep vehicles affordable. One 
analyst said the only surprise in August's reports was the strength 
in passenger cars, partly due to incentives and a lack of the most 
popular truck models. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be that consumers would prefer to buy light trucks if  
they could get them, but they can't get the one they want,'' said 
David Garrity, an analyst with Dresdner Kleinwort Benson in New 
York. ``So passenger cars become an acceptable substitute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford, GM and DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler division as a group sold  
978,333 cars and light trucks last month -- a 26 percent increase 
over the strike-torn August of a year ago. The American nameplates 
captured about 66 percent of the market, with GM just below its 
goal of having 30 percent of the market by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say the standout performer of the Big Three was GM,  
who also had an incentive level that I would estimate is the 
highest in the industry,'' Garrity said. 
</P>
<P>
	European companies saw sales increase about 29 percent. Sales  
were up sharply at the two Ford-owned European nameplates, with 
Volvo up 11 percent and Jaguar up 87 percent behind the S-Type 
sedan. Another European automaker, BMW, saw sales zoom 31.5 percent 
on sales of the 2000 3-series. 
</P>
<P>
	Asian automakers gained about 7 percent as a group. Hyundai, Kia  
and Suzuki all posted gains.

<HEADLINE> Sources: Clintons Bid For NY House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN, N.Y. (AP) -- The vacationing President Clinton and his  
wife have made a bid on a Georgian colonial house they toured last 
weekend in a New York City suburb, according to sources familiar 
with the Clintons' hunt for a post-White House residence. 
</P>
<P>
	They're involved in trying to secure that house, in trying to  
buy it,'' a source familiar with the negotiations said Wednesday. 
``They've made some progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons offered less than the nearly $1.7 million asking  
price, but sources would not detail the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple spent two hours touring the 110-year-old Westchester  
County house on a little more than an acre of parklike grounds. The 
house is near golf courses and boasts a swimming pool, lush 
landscaping and an exercise room on the top floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The house apparently passed security muster this week. The  
Secret Service checked out the house with an eye to protecting 
Clinton when he is a private citizen. Former presidents have a 
small security detail. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Clintons toured historic sites in upstate New  
York while taking time out for plenty of glad-handing with locals 
who might one day help elect Mrs. Clinton their senator. 
</P>
<P>
	The museum tour was heavy on sites honoring 19th century women  
who fought to free slaves and to gain voting rights. The Clintons 
drew crowds at every stop on a five-hour sightseeing trip of the 
Finger Lakes region, where the family is spending the final week of 
their summer vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're off on an excursion,'' Clinton said as the couple set  
out after coffee at a cafe in the village of Skaneateles. They are 
staying at a borrowed estate just outside the village of restored 
Victorian houses and shops that cater to summer crowds of boaters 
and sightseers. 
</P>
<P>
	Their stay is part relaxation and part political maneuvering, as  
Mrs. Clinton calculates whether to mount a formal campaign for a 
Senate seat in New York next year. She scheduled two fund-raising 
parties later today for her exploratory campaign committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The family's 16-day vacation in Massachusetts and New York was  
punctuated by political fund raising that will yield an estimated 
$800,000 for her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Clintons held hands while a guide at the  
Harriet Tubman Home museum in Auburn described how the escaped 
slave made 19 trips back to the South to lead 300 others to 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton was given a T-shirt with a quotation from Tubman,  
whose bravery and clever use of the ``Underground Railroad'' 
network of safehouses and escape routes earned her the nickname 
``Moses of her people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you are tired, keep going. If you are scared, keep going.  
If you are hungry, keep going. If you want to taste freedom, keep 
going,'' the quotation read. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Mrs. Clinton collected an unofficial endorsement from the  
mayor of Seneca Falls, considered the birthplace of the women's 
rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Al Corrado, a self-described Republican, was among the crowd of  
well-wishers in Seneca Falls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Beautiful. I like it,'' Corrado, said of the idea of a Clinton  
Senate run. 
</P>
<P>
	The rangers at the Women's Rights National Historical Park were  
impressed with the president's knowledge of the suffragette 
movement, and jokingly offered him a job when he leaves the White 
House after the 2000 presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, I can work for cheap,'' Clinton said with a smile.  
``I've got a good pension.''

<HEADLINE> Subpoenas Issued Over Clemency Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House committee subpoenaed all  
administration records Wednesday related to President Clinton's 
decision to offer clemency to 16 Puerto Rican militants. 
</P>
<P>
	Subpoenas issued by Rep. Dan Burton's Committee on Government  
Reform and Oversight, which were obtained by The Associated Press, 
seek records from the White House, Justice Department and the 
Bureau of Prisons. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,  
also requested information from the Justice Department in 
anticipation of expected congressional hearings on the matter 
sometime this month. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno, Hatch, R-Utah, said  
he was troubled by published reports indicating the Justice 
Department did not make a formal recommendation to the White House 
on the clemency issue despite the law enforcement officials' 
vigorous objections. He also said he was bothered by reports that 
there were Bureau of Prison recordings of the inmates in which they 
plotted to again use violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hope that, on a matter of such importance, the  
Department of Justice -- and the attorney general in particular -- 
would make its views known to the White House,'' Hatch wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bureau of Prisons has declined to confirm or deny existence  
of the audio tapes, but a spokesman did say that inmates social 
calls are monitored routinely by officials. The Justice Department 
did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton announced last month that he would commute the sentences  
of the 16 Puerto Rican nationalists if they disavowed the use of 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 16 are members of the FALN -- the Spanish initials  
for Armed Forces of National Liberation -- which carried out some 
130 bomb attacks on political and military targets in the United 
States between 1974 and 1983. The attacks killed six people and 
wounded dozens more. 
</P>
<P>
	Human rights officials argued that the sentences -- ranging from  
15 years to 90 years in prison -- were too harsh given that none of 
them were convicted of involvement in any deaths. Clinton offered 
freedom to 11 of the 16 prisoners and reductions in fines and 
sentences for the others. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans accused Clinton of making the offer to boost  
his wife's all-but-announced Senate candidacy from New York, home 
to nearly 1.3 million Puerto Ricans. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Jim Kennedy called that assertion  
``absolutely false'' but said he could not comment on the issue of 
the subpoena itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats also opposed the clemency. Among them is Sen.  
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the retiring New York lawmaker whose seat 
Hillary Rodham Clinton may seek, said his chief of staff, Tony 
Bullock. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who sits on the  
Judiciary Committee, said he wanted more information. 
</P>
<P>
	``The senator's position is that he wants the clemency reports  
to be released because he wants this issue to be decided on a 
case-by-case basis,'' Schumer spokeswoman Michelle Schwartz said.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Benchmark Stock Index Drops / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's benchmark stock index closed lower today as  
investors took profits from a sharp rise the previous day. The 
dollar inched higher against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed down 171.23  
points, or 0.96 percent, to 17,631.25. On Wednesday, the average 
finished 365.92 points, or 2.1 percent, higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 109.42 yen at late afternoon, up 0.20 yen from  
its level of 109.22 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its 
late New York level of 109.05 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	In stock trading, traders said today's drop cloaked resilient  
market sentiment sustained by an overnight rebound on Wall Street 
and hopes for an economic recovery in Japan, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite the yen's strength, the market remains comparatively  
strong,'' said Kazunori Jinnai, deputy general manager at Daiwa 
Securities SB Capital Markets. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong yen makes Japanese exporters' products more expensive,  
and thus less competitive, overseas. Their foreign revenues also 
lose value in terms of the Japanese currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Retreating issues outnumbered advancers 871 to 372 on the Tokyo  
Stock Exchange's First Section, while 92 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 108.60, or  
1 percent, to 10,937.88 at Wednesday's finish. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 0.75 points, or 0.05 percent, to 1,496.99. The 
TOPIX closed up 39.22 points, or 2.69 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In foreign exchange dealings, the U.S. currency recovered some  
ground as U.S. and European hedge funds bought back oversold 
dollars, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar traded between 108.70 yen and 109.58 yen during Tokyo  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 115.86 yen in late  
afternoon, down from 116.08 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 215 10-year Japanese government  
bond was unchanged from Wednesday's finish at 1.8800 percent. The 
price remained at 100.16 yen.

<HEADLINE> Dennis Lingers Off N.C. for 3rd Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAGS HEAD, N.C. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Dennis hung off North  
Carolina's Outer Banks for a third day Thursday and kept pounding 
away at the coast with 14-foot waves and 45 mph gusts, doing more 
damage to the beach than a single blow from a big hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is immensely worse as far as damage to the shoreline and  
beachfront retreat,'' said Orrin Pilkey, a Duke University coastal 
geologist. Although a hurricane can be deadly because it can blow 
down buildings, it typically ``goes across the islands very 
quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The assault on the North Carolina coast has been going on since  
early Monday. Dennis first battered the shoreline as a hurricane, 
then headed out to sea and weakened. But within a day, it was 
backtracking toward the Outer Banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The toll was evident everywhere on Hatteras Island, where wind  
and waves flung beach dunes onto the main highway and chewed up the 
asphalt. Abandoned trucks, some overturned, were half-buried in 
sand near the road. 
</P>
<P>
	The highway, N.C. 12, was expected to partially reopen late  
Thursday, but it will be several weeks before it can be rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's beyond the crisis stage,'' state Public Safety Secretary  
Richard Moore said. ``There are places where there are no dunes at 
all, and if you try to just throw blacktop down, you're throwing 
your money away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As far away as Florida, huge waves generated by Dennis stripped  
sand from newly refurbished beaches, popped planks out of fishing 
piers and flooded beachfront condos. 
</P>
<P>
	Waves lapped 20 feet away from where the Cape Hatteras  
Lighthouse used to stand, 150 feet from the Atlantic. It was moved 
in July to keep it from toppling into the sea and now sits 1,600 
feet from the surf. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of reassuring to see the light safely away from  
the waves,'' Moore said. A relighting ceremony planned Saturday at 
the 208-foot lighthouse, the nation's tallest, was postponed 
because of the weather. 
</P>
<P>
	At 8 p.m. EDT, Dennis, which was downgraded from a hurricane  
late Tuesday, was 110 miles southeast of Cape Hatteras, drifting 
slowly to the south but expected to continue later on a southwest 
track. A tropical storm warning remained in effect from Cape 
Lookout, N.C., to Cape Charles Light, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Blaes of the National Weather Service said Dennis would  
probably continue to drift slowly to the west and southwest for the 
next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Erosion experts compare Dennis to a nor'easter, the winter storm  
that does not pack a hurricane's wallop but stays longer, making it 
worse for the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Outer Banks -- a thin, 130-mile strand of barrier islands  
-- the storm cut a trench Wednesday across a quarter-mile neck of 
Hatteras Island. But on Thursday, the breach had partly filled up 
with wind-blown beach sand. 
</P>
<P>
	With road crews working to clear a path through drifted sand and  
standing water, National Guard convoys managed to reach villages on 
the southern end of Hatteras with food and supplies. Power and 
water service were restored to much of the island, but the phones 
still were down. 
</P>
<P>
	Electric power also was restored on Ocracoke Island, which had  
operated for days on generator power. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Touhey, owner of the Island Inn and Restaurant on Ocracoke,  
said that islanders are calling this the worst flooding since 
Hurricane Gloria in 1985. With every high tide, the island floods 
again, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't come back like it did the night of the hurricane,  
but there's just high water everywhere,'' he said, and 
``everybody's walking around in rubber boots or waders, or 
something just to get around.''

<HEADLINE> Landmark N.Y. Bar Hurley's To Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ben Harte downed his first drink inside Hurley's  
saloon on St. Patrick's Day, 1965. Thirty-four years later, the 
veteran journalist drank red wine at an Irish wake for the corner 
bar that once stood up to the mighty Rockefellers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the kind of bar where status was left at the door,''  
Harte said as Friday's closing of the Rockefeller Center 
institution drew near. ``It's one of the few places where people 
didn't come to impress. They came to talk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was plenty to talk about. The bar, which dates to the 19th  
century, had quite a history before owner Adrien Barbey recently 
decided to close shop. 
</P>
<P>
	At Hurley's, Mayor John Lindsay was once hissed. Henry Kissinger  
and two bodyguards were ejected by a bartender for rowdy behavior. 
John Belushi and Howard Hughes (who loved Hurley's burgers) were 
among the patrons receiving better treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	When Jack Paar walked off his show's set after fighting with NBC  
censors in 1960, he came to hide in Hurley's. Years later, David 
Letterman -- in one of several on-air visits to the bar -- bought a 
round of drinks for all at the 60-foot black granite bar. 
</P>
<P>
	But the best story was the Hurley brothers' refusal of the  
Rockefellers' millions. When John D. Rockefeller began snapping up 
leases for construction of Rockefeller Center, the Hurleys turned 
him down flat and never wavered. 
</P>
<P>
	The 70-story RCA building, the centerpiece of the Manhattan  
architectural marvel, had to be built around the four-story bar, 
much to the delight of many. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their lease on that old building gave us all a new lease on  
life,'' New York Times columnist William Safire, a Hurley's regular 
from the 1970s, once wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	A vintage photo of the tavern, standing at the edge of the razed  
block on which the RCA building would soon rise, still hangs above 
a booth in the bar-restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurley's, in addition to its history, boasted something else:  
location. Rockefeller Center workers and tourists easily found 
their way to its comfortable confines. NBC technicians spent so 
much time in Hurley's that they dubbed it Studio 1-H. The nearby 
Associated Press could have opened a small bureau there. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just too bad,'' said Ralph Pelletiere, a former AP man  
who was mourning with Harte. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurley's was the last of the neighborhood's vintage  
bar-restaurants. Chain restaurants and microbreweries have taken 
their place. 
</P>
<P>
	The difference?  
</P>
<P>
	``These people are old friends,'' Barbey said, gesturing at his  
place. ``They are not clients.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barbey, 64, decided the time was right to close after undergoing  
heart and stomach surgery last year. He and his son agreed to let 
Tischman Speyer Properties buy out their lease. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurley's rumored replacement is a fancy supermarket that sells  
ostrich steaks and 33 kinds of coffee beans -- hardly a substitute 
for its predecessor's Manhattan clam chowder and filet mignon. 
</P>
<P>
	As word of the bar's imminent demise spread, Barbey fielded  
condolence calls from California, Georgia, Florida, even New 
Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	The bar's windowsills were filled with floral arrangements sent  
by fans. It was an appropriate gesture: The Hurley brothers ran a 
speakeasy during Prohibition, selling booze in the back while 
renting the front to a florist. 
</P>
<P>
	As the closing hour approached, customer reached for keepsakes.  
Some clutched menus. Others asked for the blue and white 
matchbooks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Take a whole box,'' Barbey told one grieving regular. ``For  
you, there's a whole box.''

<HEADLINE> Risebrough Named Minnesota Wild GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Minnesota Wild CEO Jac Sperling has  
accomplished what former Minnesota hockey coach Herb Brooks 
couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
	He lured Doug Risebrough out of Canada.  
</P>
<P>
	``Life has a funny way of coming around,'' said Risebrough, who  
was hired Thursday as the Wild's first general manager and 
executive vice president. ``Twenty-eight years ago, I was recruited 
by a number of colleges and the only trip I made was to the 
University of Minnesota to see Herbie Brooks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Risebrough decided to go straight to the pros instead.  
</P>
<P>
	``It worked out for both of us long term,'' Risebrough said.  
``Herb boasted about the fact that he won a national championship 
with an All-American team, and I would have been the blemish there. 
</P>
<P>
	``And the same year that he boasted about that, I was hoisting  
the Stanley Cup over my head with the Montreal Canadiens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Risebrough, 45, who has spent 25 years in the NHL as a player,  
coach and executive, has been vice president of hockey operations 
with the Edmonton Oilers the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Sperling said he had to compensate Oilers general manager Glen  
Slather to sign Risebrough but wouldn't divulge details or other 
terms of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will just tell you that Glen didn't get to be one of the  
best GMs in the league by being a rollover kind of guy,'' Sperling 
said. ``But I want to tell you also that he is a very tough 
negotiator and he has trained Doug well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Risebrough said he is in no hurry to hire a coach before next  
year's expansion draft but will begin building his front office and 
scouting staff immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wild begins play in the 2000-2001 season at St. Paul,  
returning the NHL to Minnesota after a seven-year absence. 
</P>
<P>
	Risebrough said he might bring some Oilers personnel with him to  
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	``Glen has never really opposed anybody from improving  
positions,'' Risebrough said. ``I have had to deal with that 
generosity because I hired a lot of the people that he's let move 
on. ... He just said, `Don't take too many.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wild also considered several other candidates, including  
general managers Craig Patrick of Pittsburgh and Bobby Smith of 
Phoenix, but Sperling said Risebrough ``was our number one choice. 
No other offers were extended.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A forward, Risebrough played eight seasons in Montreal and five  
for Calgary. The native of Guelph, Ontario, was a first-round draft 
selection by Montreal in 1974. After playing for four Stanley Cup 
champions in Montreal, he was traded to Calgary in 1982 and retired 
in 1987 with 471 points in 740 games. 
</P>
<P>
	He was an assistant with Calgary when the Flames won the 1989  
Stanley Cup. He coached Calgary to a 46-26-8 record in 1990-91, 
then became general manager and coach of the Flames. 
</P>
<P>
	Risebrough gave up coaching during the 1991-92 season but  
continued as GM until the 1995-96 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has five Stanley Cup rings and in his 25 years in the NHL,  
his teams were in the playoffs for 22 of those years,'' Sperling 
said. ``We're talking about someone who knows how to win. He's been 
around winners.''

<HEADLINE> Cooper Wants WNBA Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Houston Comets star Cynthia Cooper has had more  
than her share of adversity. 
</P>
<P>
	Her mother, Mary, was diagnosed with breast cancer shortly  
before the inaugural WNBA season in the spring of 1997. She died in 
February, the same month that Cooper's best friend and teammate, 
Kim Perrot, announced she had lung and brain cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Perrot died on Aug. 19. Cooper hopes to dedicate her third WNBA  
championship to the feisty point guard who helped lead the Comets 
to consecutive titles in 1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud of the team and how they stuck together in tough  
times,'' Cooper said. ``It seems like every season it's 
something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With heavy hearts, Houston meets the New York Liberty in the  
best-of-3 championship series that begins tonight at Madison Square 
Garden. Thoughts of Perrot are not far from the players' minds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Emotionally, we're OK,'' Cooper said. ``We're not exactly  
where we ideally would want to be. It's been extremely tough. But 
this season we hung in there and came away with the best record in 
the WNBA. We're looking to win this championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Comets finished the regular season 26-6 and defeated Los  
Angeles 2-1 in the Western Conference finals. New York, picked to 
finish fourth in the Eastern Conference, finished first with an 
18-14 record and defeated Charlotte 2-1 in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The series is a rematch of the inaugural one-game 1997 WNBA  
championship, which the Comets won 65-51. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston coach Van Chancellor is looking forward to exciting  
front-court play. Cooper, the league's scoring leader for the third 
time with a 22.1 average, faces Teresa Weatherspoon, a two-time 
WNBA defensive player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's Cooper, the ultimate offensive player, against  
Weatherspoon, the ultimate defensive player,'' Chancellor said. 
``It's a tremendous matchup. Both are the inspirational leaders of 
their teams. It's a matchup second to none.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teams split two games this season, each winning at home. New  
York won 74-71 before 19,563 at Madison Square Garden on Aug. 8, 
holding the Comets to one offensive rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	The Liberty lost 65-50 at Houston on July 3. New York scored  
just 15 points in the first half and set league records for 
futility in field goals made (14) and shooting percentage (21.8). 
</P>
<P>
	The challenge for New York is to contain the Comets' three stars  
-- Cooper, Sheryl Swoopes and Tina Thompson. They averaged a 
combined 52.6 points during the regular season. The Liberty's top 
three scorers averaged 34.2 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have to be ready for the Big Three,'' Weatherspoon  
said. ``Houston is a totally different team than Charlotte. You can 
be up by 20 points, and it's not enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Rebecca Lobo went down with a season-ending knee injury 42  
seconds into the opener, New York's future looked bleak. But 
veteran Sue Wicks and rookie Tamika Whitmore went to work on the 
boards, and Crystal Robinson, the Liberty's first-round pick, made 
43.7 percent of her 3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
	Known for defense, the Liberty have shown offensive spark during  
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	New York shot a playoff-record 55 percent in Game 2 against  
Charlotte and followed with a 54-percent performance on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Liberty will have to overcome the emotional strength of  
the Comets, who are driven to win for Perrot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even at the beginning of the season, we wanted to dedicate our  
season to Kim,'' Swoopes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Comets return to Houston on Saturday for Game 2 and, if  
necessary, Game 3 on Sunday. The WNBA playoff format gives the team 
with the best record the homecourt advantage in the final two 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like the format now,'' New York coach Richie Adubato said.  
``I don't think they've lost any playoff games at home, so we'll 
take the first one here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Houston went 15-1 at home during the regular season, while the  
Liberty was 12-4 at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams have played 10 games, with the overall series tied at  
5-5. Both teams have had success on the road, with Houston winning 
three times in New York and the Liberty prevailing twice in 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know it's going to be a dogfight,'' Liberty forward Sophia  
Witherspoon said. ``Everybody wants that ring and everybody wants 
that trophy.''

<HEADLINE> Wildcats QB Loses Eligibility Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A Chicago judge on Thursday upheld an NCAA rule  
that bars Northwestern quarterback Zachary Kustok from playing in 
Saturday's opening game against Miami of Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Michael Getty refused to immediately overturn the  
rule, which would keep Kustok from playing for the Wildcats in 
their first seven games this season. 
</P>
<P>
	But Getty did offer to hold a hearing later that might get  
Kustok onto the field by the season's third or fourth game, 
attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kustok played one season at Notre Dame but never got into a game  
and decided to attend school elsewhere. He claims the NCAA 
compliance officer at Kansas told him last fall that he would still 
have three seasons of football eligibility at another Division IA 
school if he successfully completed one year at a junior college. 
</P>
<P>
	Kustok completed a year at Moraine Valley Community College in  
Palos Hills and accepted a scholarship to Northwestern in February. 
He expected to be eligible, starting with the opening game. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA, however, ruled that Kustok must sit out the first  
seven games. Northwestern appealed the NCAA ruling but lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Kustok attorney Peter Rush told the court that his client  
shouldn't be penalized merely because the Kansas compliance officer 
gave him bad information about his eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20-year-old Kustok has been practicing as a backup to  
starter Nick Kreinbrink.

saying, ``George Bush has it wrapped up because the party hierarchy

<HEADLINE> Injured Marion Jones Ends Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- It's wait until next year for sprinter  
Marion Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	Back spasms will prevent Jones from competing again this year,  
but she still plans to seek an unprecedented five gold medals in at 
the Sydney Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	She still hopes to win gold in the 100 and 200 meters, long jump  
and 400- and 1,600-meter relays next year, her agent, Charlie 
Wells, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But for now, while she is improving, ``she is not well enough to  
compete,'' Wells said in a telephone interview from Brussels, 
Belgium, where Jones had hoped to resume her season at a Golden 
League meet Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones collapsed on the track in the semifinals of the women's  
200 meters at the world championships last week in Seville, Spain, 
suffering from cramps and back spasms. 
</P>
<P>
	She returned to the United States over the weekend for further  
evaluation. Her doctors recommended she not compete again this 
season, Wells said. The former North Carolina basketball and track 
star trains at North Carolina State. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate, and we know her many fans will be  
disappointed, but it was not worth the risk,'' Wells told The News 
&AMP; Observer of Raleigh. He said Jones would continue to be evaluated 
in the United States, but declined to elaborate on the extent of 
her injury.

<HEADLINE> Darryl Hitless in First Game Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There were no majestic home runs from Darryl  
Strawberry in his comeback. Not even a base hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a couple of strikeouts and a walk for the New York Yankees  
slugger in his first game back from colon cancer and a drug 
suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	``You always look for the situation to do something dramatic,''  
Strawberry said Thursday after the Yankees beat the Oakland 
Athletics 9-3. ``It just wasn't one of those days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry's fourth comeback in five years with the Yankees  
began with warm applause from the 33,147 fans, who remember the 
dramatic homers and the role Strawberry played on two World Series 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry's first major league at-bat since last Sept. 27, came  
leading off the second inning against Gil Heredia and offered no 
new memories. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry took a big cut at the first pitch, fouling it back  
onto the screen. After taking a called second strike and then a 
ball, Strawberry checked his swing on a fastball that nipped the 
outside corner. 
</P>
<P>
	John Shulock called him out and Strawberry walked back to the  
dugout after a brief discussion of the call. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take some at-bats for me to make the  
adjustments,'' Strawberry said. ``When you haven't played at this 
level for this long, it takes more than one day to get back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry walked on five pitches in the third inning and was  
erased on a double-play grounder by Jorge Posada. 
</P>
<P>
	With a man on second and one out in the fifth, Oakland manager  
brought in left-hander Ron Mahay. Strawberry looked overmatched 
this time, again striking out on four pitches. He waved at strike 
three. 
</P>
<P>
	Chili Davis pinch-hit for Strawberry in the sixth.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was really good to be back, with all the guys pulling for  
me,'' Strawberry said. ``It was a good day overall for the club. We 
won the game. That's the most important thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next month will be a test for Strawberry, as manager Joe  
Torre determines whether Strawberry can contribute in the 
postseason. He will get at-bats as a pinch-hitter and a few chances 
to start at DH or in left field as Torre rests his regulars down 
the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``He feels comfortable and it's just a matter of getting him  
at-bats,'' Torre said.

<HEADLINE> Court Nixes Unequal Immigration Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A long-standing immigration law making it  
easier for children born out of wedlock overseas to become a U.S. 
citizen if their mother is a citizen is unconstitutional sex 
discrimination, a federal appeals court ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The law, passed during the Korean War, applies to children born  
abroad to one U.S. citizen parent and one foreign parent who are 
not married. 
</P>
<P>
	If the mother is a U.S. citizen, the child is automatically a  
U.S. citizen provided the mother has lived in the United States 
continuously for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	If the father is a U.S. citizen, additional requirements apply:  
The father must agree in writing to support the child until age 18, 
and paternity must be established by marriage, a sworn 
acknowledgment by the father or a court finding. 
</P>
<P>
	The law relies on ``outdated stereotypes ... the generalization  
that mothers are more likely to have close ties to and care for 
their children than are fathers,'' said the opinion by Judge Mary 
Schroeder. She said the law also ``presumes that a father will not 
care for and support his child unless required to do so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Arthur Alarcon agreed, but Judge Andrew Kleinfeld  
dissented, saying the majority had misunderstood the Supreme Court 
ruling. He also said the law had a ``rational purpose'' that ``may 
not be pretty'' but should not be questioned by courts: to limit 
the citizenship claims of children fathered by U.S. soldiers in 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling overturned the conviction of Ricardo Ahumada-Aguilar,  
Mexican-born son of a Mexican mother and a U.S. citizen father. 
Ahumada became a legal U.S. resident in California at 13, after his 
mother married a U.S. citizen, but he was deported seven years 
later after a cocaine conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	He re-entered the country twice and was charged in Seattle in  
1995 with the crime of illegal entry after deportation. A judge 
rejected his claim of citizenship and sentenced him to a year and 
three months in prison.

<HEADLINE> Okla. Farmers Say They've Won $23M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOULD, Okla. (AP) -- Rick Holder was out on his cattle ranch over  
the weekend when a friend called with some good news: Holder was 
suddenly very, very rich. 
</P>
<P>
	The caller, Jimmy Pendergraft, told him that he, Holder, and 10  
other friends had bought the winning ticket in the $23 million 
Texas Lottery jackpot drawn Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't believe him for a while,'' Holder said Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	The reality of winning a fortune is slowly sinking in for the 12  
men and women in this 250-resident town of decaying storefronts and 
parched brown fields. 
</P>
<P>
	After suffering through last year's drought, the worst since the  
Great Depression, those who tend the cotton and alfalfa fields here 
saw their crops wiped out by a spring hail storm. Others have too 
much cotton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nearly everybody on that list needed money,'' said Randy  
Mefford, another winner who owns and operates one of the largest 
farming operations in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	The pool began about five years ago, when the lottery hit $50  
million. The group agreed to buy tickets, but only if the pot was 
at least $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``This really started off being just a game, a conversation  
piece. It's something to talk about,'' said Pendergraft. The group 
agreed to spend between $120 and $140 each time. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Macom, who lives in a trailer on his parents' property in  
nearby Eldorado, purchased $120 worth of tickets at a gas station 
in Quanah, Texas, about 10 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	On his return, he left the tickets on the dashboard of his  
truck. 
</P>
<P>
	When Macom got an excited wake up call early Sunday, he rushed  
to retrieve the winning $1 ticket and verified the numbers. Then he 
promptly woke up Pendergraft. 
</P>
<P>
	From there, word soon trickled down to other winners.  
</P>
<P>
	Bonofasio Olguin, a farm laborer who also works for Mefford, was  
out in the field picking cotton when he found out. Olguin had 
rolled pennies so he could get in on the pool. 
</P>
<P>
	Holder, the president of Stockman's Bank, placed the winning  
ticket in the vault that morning, Pendergraft said. It has since 
been moved, but Pendergraft wouldn't say where. 
</P>
<P>
	It could be at least three weeks before the group can collect  
their fortune. They opted for an early cash out, and after taxes 
could only end up with about $500,000 each, Pendergraft said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Mefford and Pendergraft were back at work at the  
country store on Highway 5 as if nothing had happened. Both men, 
who have lived with risk all their lives in southwestern Oklahoma, 
said they don't believe much will change. 
</P>
<P>
	``Farming is a little bit of a gamble,'' said Mefford, 45, who  
plans to use the winnings to get out of debt. ``You put so many 
dollars into a crop and you have no idea how it's going to come 
out.''

<HEADLINE> Asian Recovery Said Incomplete </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Asia's apparent economic recovery this year is  
fragile and still faces huge risks, analysts said Thursday at a 
regional forum in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
	``The year 1999 has been unusually favorable to us. I do not  
expect that to be the pattern for 2000,'' said Christopher Nailer, 
director of advisory services for The Economist Conferences. 
</P>
<P>
	``After a year as bad as 1998 was, it's not surprising to see  
strong rebounds in 1999,'' Nailer told The Associated Press. ``I 
don't think the recovery is solid yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking on the sidelines of The Economist Conferences'  
bi-annual economic and political forecasting meeting, Nailer said 
that ``volatility and uncertainty in the Japan-U.S. economic 
relationship dwarfs any other risk factor for the region, because 
all of Asia has very substantial degree of dependence on either or 
both of those two major economies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strong fluctuations between the dollar and yen could destabilize  
other Asian currency rates, creating an uncertain trade 
environment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Multibillion-dollar International Monetary Fund bailout packages  
disbursed in Asia are giving the region a temporary boost, but 
``gradually, that money dries up.'' Nailer added. ``It's not 
repeatable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Asian governments can't indefinitely continue the current  
loose fiscal policies that have spurred consumer demand, the 
analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States' spectacular economic performance and  
unusually good weather this year in Asia -- a boon for agriculture -- 
are other positive factors that should not be counted on to last, 
he noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Asia's slight upswing this year is also threatened by signs that  
some governments are not reforming their economies as promised, 
Nailer and other analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the finance sector, we're seeing some of the previously  
positive progress that was made six months ago starting to 
unravel,'' Nailer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia's recent Bank Bali scandal is a prime example of this  
backsliding, said James Castle, chairman of the Jakarta-based 
Castle Group consultancy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The current establishment (in Indonesia) has shown absolutely  
zero ability to cope with reform,'' Castle said. ``It's yesterday's 
behavior in tomorrow's world.''

<HEADLINE> South Korea To Meet on Seoulbank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The government's financial watchdog  
agency will meet Friday to decide whether to declare Seoulbank 
insolvent and inject additional government funds into the ailing 
bank, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting by the Financial Supervisory Commission comes the  
same week that talks broke down between the government and HSBC 
Holdings PLC over the British bank's acquisition of a controlling 
stake in Seoulbank. The two sides could not reach agreement over 
the terms. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides signed a memorandum of understanding in February  
calling for HSBC to buy a 70-percent stake in Seoulbank for $700 
million, with the Seoul government keeping the remaining 30 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides differed on the amount of bad loans that the  
government would have covered after selling the majority interest 
in Seoulbank. 
</P>
<P>
	The government invested $1.34 billion in Seoulbank and Korea  
First Bank last year, effectively nationalizing them. 
</P>
<P>
	Sale of the two troubled banks was one of the conditions laid  
down by the International Monetary Fund in exchange for its $58 
billion bailout of South Korea's sinking economy in late 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	President Kim Dae-jung's government insisted on selling the  
banks to foreigners to demonstrate its willingness to open the 
cloistered domestic financial sector.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- District of Columbia firefighters who greeted  
their colleague, Joseph Morgan Jr., with hugs Wednesday said there 
were times during the past three months when they didn't think he 
would make it. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was bandaged from head to toe. He looked like a mummy,''  
said Assistant Fire Chief William Mould. 
</P>
<P>
	But Morgan, of Brentwood, Md., was determined to recover from  
the severe burns that covered 60 percent of his body. He sustained 
them while fighting a blaze in a townhouse on May 30. Two other 
firefighters, Anthony Phillips and Louis Matthews, were killed. 
Smoke detectors allowed the residents to escape without injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan, 37, left Washington Hospital Center a week ago. Doctors  
said he would be off the job at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I plan on cutting that time in half,'' he said, during a news  
conference at his Northeast fire station Wednesday. ``Doctors say 
my wounds are healing at a miraculous rate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan said he will continue to have physical therapy three  
times a week. 
</P>
<P>
	He credited the support he received from people in the  
Washington area and around the world with helping him to recover. 
</P>
<P>
	The May fire in the basement of a townhouse at 3146 Cherry Lane,  
N.E., was electrical, said Fire Chief Donald Edwards. Firefighters 
are still investigating what went so wrong, he said.

<HEADLINE> Belluzzo To Run Microsoft Web Unit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. today named Richard Belluzzo, a  
computer industry veteran who most recently headed California-based 
Silicon Graphics Inc., to run its Internet operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Belluzzo, 45, will oversee Microsoft's Consumer and Commerce  
Group as the company seeks to expand its online commerce services. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tremendous opportunity given the fundamental change the  
Internet brings to the world,'' Belluzzo said in a telephone 
interview from Microsoft headquarters in suburban Redmond. ``Having 
a chance to be part of a team that has the resources, the vision 
and the technical strength that Microsoft has is a tremendous 
opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brad Chase and Jon DeVaan, who had jointly headed the Consumer  
and Commerce Group since its formation in March, were named to 
positions directly under Belluzzo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's announcements underscore our commitment to executing  
decisively and rapidly in the online services space by forming a 
seasoned management team that is dedicated to improving and 
facilitating commerce for consumers,'' said Microsoft President 
Steve Ballmer, to whom Belluzzo will report. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballmer called Belluzzo ``a very focused businessman, a great  
leader and a great lover of the consumer'' who will ``help 
complement our online business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belluzzo resigned last week as chairman and chief executive  
officer of Silicon Graphics, a position he held for less than two 
years. Before he moved to Silicon Graphics, Belluzzo had a 22-year 
career at Hewlett-Packard, where he became the No. 2 executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's recent Web investments have focused mainly on  
communications, shopping, travel, scheduling and personal finance. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the company has pulled back from some of its media  
ventures. It recently sold off its collection of city arts and 
entertainment guides, MSN Sidewalk, for about $240 million to 
Ticketmaster Online-Citysearch. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's Consumer and Commerce Group's was formed as part of  
a reorganization announced in March and is designed to link 
consumers and businesses online.

<HEADLINE>  Night of Tears for MLB Umpires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- For umpires, there is crying in baseball.  
</P>
<P>
	Eyes accustomed to calling balls and strikes were filled with  
tears Wednesday night after 22 umps lost their jobs, part of a 
complex deal between their union and baseball that was brokered by 
a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
	``It not only has broken my heart, but it has devastated me as  
an individual,'' said Tom Hallion, one of 13 NL umps let go. 
``Right now, I'm sitting here, I just did my last game. This is 
what I want to do, this is what I love to do. I love baseball. 
Right now, I hate baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the four umps on Hallion's crew were sent home for the  
season, their only hope an arbitration hearing months from now. 
Between the eighth and ninth innings, Dodger Stadium organist Nancy 
Bea Hefley paid tribute to the departing umpires with a few 
choruses of ``I'll Be Seeing You.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Baltimore, Greg Kosc had tears in his eyes as Orioles manager  
Ray Miller handed him his lineup card before the game. Mark McGwire 
held open his glove after the final out in St. Louis, giving the 
ball to Frank Pulli, a 28-year veteran. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's one of the 22 worst umpires in this league, I'm a  
kamikaze pilot,'' Cardinals third-base coach Rene Lachemann said. 
``It's a big mistake that they fired him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly one-third of the sport's 68 permanent umpires are out of  
work, although the agreement provides for them to be paid for the 
rest of the year. On July 14, more than 50 umpires announced a mass 
resignation effective Sept. 2, an attempt to force an early start 
to talks for a new labor agreement to replace the deal expiring 
Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Their strategy backfired when owners accepted the resignations,  
and 27 umps, mostly in the American League, broke ranks with union 
leader Richie Phillips, either by refusing to quit and quickly 
taking back their resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Wednesday's agreement, umpires have the right to take the  
dispute to arbitration and argue baseball should have accepted the 
resignation rescissions of all umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	Their salary and benefits for the rest of the year would be  
deducted from their termination pay if they lose the grievance. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside court room 8-B, AL ump Mark Johnson couldn't focus on  
that, and tears filled his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no idea what I'm going to do now,'' he said. ``There  
aren't a lot of opportunities out there for a 48-year old ex-major 
league umpire that I know of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires filed suit to block baseball from letting the 22 go, but  
owners had an overwhelming legal advantage because it was the 
umpires themselves who voluntarily submitted the resignations, 
which they now say was only a symbolic protest. 
</P>
<P>
	``At some point, people have to take responsibility for their  
decisions and the decisions made on their behalf,'' said Sandy 
Alderson, baseball's executive vice president of operations. ``It's 
unfortunate 22 umpires will no longer be working. We hope the 
payments each will receive will soften the transition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal mediated by U.S. District Judge J. Curtis Joyner  
during 16 hours of bargaining over two days, the union agreed the 
22 ``will provide no further services'' after 6 a.m. EDT today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think that it's a shame for baseball,'' umpires union head  
Richie Phillips said. ``Baseball will suffer from the loss of these 
enormously talented people that the commissioner's office has 
arbitrarily determined to hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, owners agreed that all umpires on staff as of  
Friday -- there will be 71 of them -- are entitled to the $20,000 
postseason bonus, an amount that totals $1.42 million. The deal 
also gives umpires the right to forgo the bonus and have it go 
directly to the union. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange, the umpires withdrew their lawsuit and the unfair  
labor practice charges against baseball they filed with the 
National Labor Relations Board. They also agreed not to strike this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five umpires hired by baseball in July became permanent  
employees today. Many are vacation fill-ins from the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``The resignations will stand and the new umpires are permanent  
employees,'' commissioner Bud Selig said. ``We are proud to have 
them on board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As several umpires left the court in the twilight of the  
evening, and perhaps their careers, they were bitter at Selig. They 
claimed that when talks recessed Tuesday night, the sides had 
agreed that any of the 22 umps could work the rest of the season at 
Selig's discretion. 
</P>
<P>
	``They took that off the table this morning,'' umpires lawyer  
Susan Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig acknowledged making the change, but said it wasn't  
significant. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no reason to put it in because they weren't going to  
work anymore,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Phillips proclaimed the deal a victory for his side,  
umpires' eyes told a different story. They couldn't believe they 
were jobless. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't these baseball people have hearts?'' NL ump Bill Hohn  
said. ``I mean, we have families. They're ruining families, and 
that's what hurts. It was a mistake, but my God, we're good people. 
We're the integrity of the game.''

<HEADLINE> Kim Indicted in Olympic Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Olympic bribery investigation produced  
its second federal criminal case with the indictment of the son of 
a powerful International Olympic Committee official. 
</P>
<P>
	John Kim, whose father is IOC executive board member Un-yong  
Kim, was indicted in Utah on Wednesday on a charge that he lied to 
the FBI about the work he did for Keystone Communications of Salt 
Lake City. The charge stems from statements the younger Kim made to 
the FBI on Feb. 23 in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Wednesday, a federal judge in Brooklyn, N.Y., unsealed a  
16-count indictment alleging Kim used a fraudulently obtained green 
card to enter the United States 16 times from 1995 to 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brooklyn indictment says Kim was put on the Keystone payroll  
by the Salt Lake Bid Committee as part of a scheme to help him 
obtain his green card and to influence his father to vote for Salt 
Lake City's Olympic bid. 
</P>
<P>
	John Kim was notified in Korea of the charges by his wife, who  
was confronted Wednesday at their home on Long Island by five armed 
Justice Department agents, Kim family spokesman Bill Schechter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agents came to the home, ``flashing their badges and weapons  
without a warrant, to the dismay of his wife, 6-year-old daughter 
and 3-year-old son,'' Schechter said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They pushed past (Kim's wife) to the room where the children  
were. They were frightened by the procedure,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim said last week that he returned to South Korea and forfeited  
his green card at the U.S. embassy there. 
</P>
<P>
	Schechter also said the Justice Department has a copy of a  
letter on Salt Lake Organizing Committee stationery written by bid 
committee head Tom Welch saying Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch 
``is prepared to provide special legislation if necessary to 
overcome any problems that John may have on his green card.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schechter said Hatch staffers made follow-up calls to Kim  
restating the offer of help. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch said he only advised the committee on immigration  
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	``My office furnished the information as we routinely do with  
all constituent requests for assistance with immigration problems. 
To my recollection, no other action was taken,'' said Hatch, who is 
seeking the Republican nomination for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim is alleged to have received $104,000 through phony contracts  
and invoices until Keystone President David E. Simmons finally 
fired him in October 1992 for ``nonperformance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kim then arranged to reimburse Simmons $40,000 to partly cover  
the expense of his own employment, and the bid committee added 
$78,000 in disguised payments to Keystone Communications, according 
to the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, meanwhile, claimed his employment was permanent and  
full-time when he applied for permanent U.S. residency. Prosecutors 
maintain Kim's employment was temporary and depended on Keystone's 
being reimbursed by the bid committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Kim told the FBI agents in February that he did  
not know the bid committee reimbursed Simmons for his salary. 
</P>
<P>
	He was also accused of lying about consulting payments for  
services he never performed. The charges also say he denied a 
relationship with a company named Kobee, which prosecutors say 
funneled some money for Kim's salary through the bid committee to 
Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors contend Kim introduced one of Kobee's officers  
to Welch and arranged a bogus consulting contract and a $20,000 
payment from the bid committee to Kobee and then to Keystone. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 3, Simmons pleaded guilty to a federal misdemeanor tax  
charge. He said he helped create a sham job for Kim and 
manufactured a paper trail to cover up the arrangement and was 
reimbursed for Kim's salary. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons was charged with illegally deducting Kim's salary as a  
business expense on his tax forms. 
</P>
<P>
	Simmons told SLOC investigators that the deal was approved by  
Un-yong Kim and masterminded by Welch. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Kim sued Simmons in Seoul District Civil Court,  
claiming Simmons' testimony was false and had hurt Kim's integrity.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Delays on New Loans to Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration has delayed  
deciding whether it should approve new loans to Russia from the 
International Monetary Fund until a full accounting is made of the 
money already lent. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration, which has been put on the defensive by  
suspicions that IMF loans to Russia were illegally diverted through 
U.S. banks, wants to make sure the money ``is going to 
reform-oriented projects,'' said John Podesta, the White House 
chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
	A report released today by the assistant inspector general at  
the Agriculture Department, based on a prior review of U.S. food 
aid to the Russian government, concluded there are adequate 
controls to prevent siphoning off of the surplus grain, corn and 
other farm products. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also noted, however, that ships carrying grain cargo  
had been spotted leaving a port on Russia's Black Sea early this 
year. The food aid agreements with the United States prohibit 
Russia ``from re-exporting any of the commodities ... and restrain 
the export of similar commodities'' unless they were sold before 
the accords were signed in December, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no evidence the ships' cargo was stolen U.S. grain,  
according to Agriculture Department officials. The ship sightings 
raised concern, however, because Russian organized crime groups are 
believed to have infiltrated ports where the U.S. food shipments 
are delivered. 
</P>
<P>
	Podesta defended the administration's record in dealing with  
Russia, citing successes in getting the Russians to withdraw from 
the Baltics and persuading former Soviet republics Ukraine and 
Kazakstan to give up nuclear weapons placed in their territory by 
the old Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had some progress. We've had some problems. And we're  
aware of the allegations of (Russian) corruption. I think ... we've 
tried to deal with them,'' Podesta said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal investigators are looking into allegations that Russian  
gangsters have laundered some $10 billion, possibly including IMF 
funds, through the Bank of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, as a presidential candidate, already has  
come under fire from some Republican rivals for his close 
relationship with Russian leaders and his hands-on role in 
U.S.-Russian diplomacy, particularly as chairman of a joint 
commission on bilateral ties with former Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian government says the case has been overblown by  
Western media and politicians. Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov called 
it part of a deliberate policy by ``certain circles who don't want 
Russia to reassert its role as a great power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's special envoy to the IMF and to other foreign lenders  
resigned suddenly today, saying he had fulfilled his mission and 
wanted to run for parliament. Mikhail Zadornov gave no indication 
that his resignation was connected to concerns that the IMF may 
delay new loans to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	He insisted that all IMF aid to Russia had been used properly,  
and predicted the next loan installment would come as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF spokesman Thomas Dawson today reiterated statements made  
earlier this week that the organization has seen no evidence that 
IMF loan money to Russia was diverted. The IMF has ``absolutely no 
evidence of any diversion or misuse of IMF funds,'' Dawson told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF head Michel Camdessus said this week that adequate controls  
are in place and he sees no reason to block new aid to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We take the allegations extremely seriously. We will continue  
to look at any new reports or old reports,'' Dawson said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also noted recent statements by Clinton administration  
officials that so far U.S. investigators have found no evidence of 
any misuse of IMF money. 
</P>
<P>
	Dawson said Russia now owes $16 billion of the $22 billion that  
the 182-nation IMF has lent it since 1992, ``so they are paying us 
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF board is expected to soon consider approving a second,  
$640 million installment under a $4.5 billion loan package for 
Russia that was previously authorized. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, in an interview in  
Wednesday's USA Today, said the administration will not support 
approval of the next installment ``without adequate safeguards to 
assure that any funds disbursed are used properly (and) without 
adequate accounting for the previous use of funds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As these investigations continue ... we'll have to make  
judgments about what constitutes a satisfactory accounting,'' 
Summers told the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> August, Year to Date Retail Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	August sales and sales for the fiscal year to date reported by  
leading retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	The sales compare the current year's sales with those of the  
previous year. Retailers are ranked according to results at the end 
of August. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporting periods vary slightly. Most retailers' fiscal years  
end in late January or early February. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales include those from stores open at least a year, also known  
as same-store or comparable store sales, and total sales. Retailers 
release only percentage changes for same-store sales, while they 
provide dollar figures and percentages for total sales. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Norway May Use Tide Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Norway's state oil company, Statoil, is  
pondering a giant recycling idea: converting unwanted offshore oil 
platforms into pollution-free power plants that transform ocean 
tides into energy. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil platforms in the deep waters off Norway include some of the  
world's tallest structures, and the cost of dismantling them as 
they become obsolete could run into billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Turning unwanted units into tidal power plants could cut costs  
and be a source of renewable energy, Bjoern Bekken of Statoil said 
Thursday. Virtually all of Norway's electricity is now provided by 
hydroelectric plants. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an interesting idea. If you look at tidal power, it's  
completely clean environmentally,'' he said by telephone from 
Statoil's headquarters in the western city of Stavanger. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea, which Bekken stressed was still in very preliminary  
stages, would be to tow unneeded platforms to land, convert them to 
power plants and then tow them to areas with strong tidal currents. 
</P>
<P>
	Those currents would turn a waterwheel, providing the power  
needed to generate electricity. 
</P>
<P>
	Statoil came upon the idea while doing a feasibility study of  
tidal power plants together with the Norwegian research institute 
SINTEF and north Norway electricity company Hammerfest Stroem, 
Bekken said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study concluded that it would be too expensive to build such  
plants from scratch. But with obsolete platforms and increasing 
efficiency of water wheels, the project could become viable, the 
study said. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem of disposing of unneeded oil platforms became a  
concern in 1995, when Greenpeace activists boarded the Brent Spar 
offshore oil buoy to prevent the Shell oil company from sinking it 
in the North Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	After the protests, Shell decided to tow the Brent Spar to  
Norway and dismantle it.

<HEADLINE> N.Y., Fla., Texas Hold Tax Holidays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Clothes strewn all over the place, lines for the  
fitting rooms, long waits at the cash register. 
</P>
<P>
	A scene from last year's Christmas rush? Nope -- just a glimpse  
of what happens when the sales tax on clothing is suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of our retailers told us, `If we run a 10 percent-off  
sale, shoppers just walk by and yawn.' But when they're getting an 
8 1/4 percent price reduction as a result of the tax holiday, they 
come in droves,'' said Mickey Moore of the Texas Retailers 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas, Florida and New York all dropped their sales tax on  
clothing for several days before the start of school. Instead of 
simply causing a shift in spending -- with shoppers buying less 
before and after the tax holiday -- the event has led to actual net 
increases in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a real increase,'' said Duncan Muir, a spokesman for  
J.C. Penney. ``Sales pretty much maintain what they have been 
before and after. Our experience is, it does get into a 
double-digit increase in sales during the tax-free period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But why would shoppers end up spending so much more than they  
are saving? 
</P>
<P>
	``The psychology of it is, you're not paying a tax,'' said Ted  
Potrikus, vice president of the Retail Council, which represents 
5,000 stores in New York State. ``It's a tax cut, and you don't 
have to file for it or wait until April 15 for it. It's immediate 
gratification. It's like sanctioned tax evasion. For a week, you 
don't have to give your money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Golder, a professor at New York University's Stern School  
of Business, said publicity -- essentially free advertising from the 
media -- and a desire among shoppers to do what everyone else is 
doing also play a role. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the idea that shopping becomes a social thing and  
community activity -- something to talk about at work, with friends 
and family,'' Golder said. 
</P>
<P>
	New York has been suspending the state's 4 percent clothing tax  
for two weeks a year -- before school and again in mid-January -- 
since 1997. Most counties and cities also suspend local taxes 
during the period, so in places like New York City, shoppers save 
8.25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The discount increased sales as much as 300 percent for some  
retailers the first time the holiday took place, according to the 
Retail Council. Increases in the years since remain in the 20 
percent to 30 percent range. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's tax-free week in New York began Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I overbought,'' said Nancy Petrone, clutching  
one of a half-dozen shopping bags filled with clothes for her two 
kids just before they tumbled to the ground at the Staten Island 
Mall. ``This is just the right time of year to buy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You bet I was waiting for this week,'' said another shopper,  
Ann Farrell, also weighed down with packages. ``With three kids all 
wanting new school stuff, you've got to do it now. Between the 
sales, no tax, no New Jersey tolls, I really save a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tolls are an issue for New Yorkers because many of them  
travel to New Jersey -- where there is no clothing tax -- to do their 
shopping. Other parts of New York state near Pennsylvania and 
Massachusetts, which also charge no clothing tax, have the same 
problem. In March, New York will permanently abolish the clothing 
tax on items under $110, partly to remain competitive with these 
other states. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have thousands of commuters who come into the city every  
day who ordinarily would not make a purchase in New York City, but 
now they will,'' said Macy's vice president Edward Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar phenomenon occurred in Florida during its tax holiday,  
July 31 to Aug. 8. The tax on clothing under $100 was suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of our retailers in Tallahassee said he looked in his  
parking lot and a number of the cars were all from Georgia,'' said 
Lori Elliott of the Florida Retail Federation.

<HEADLINE> Internet's 30th Birthday Celebrated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The computer scientists who pioneered the  
Internet and entrepreneurs who are profiting from it celebrated the 
30th anniversary Thursday of the global network's first primitive 
connection. 
</P>
<P>
	Three decades ago, on Sept. 2, 1969, a small crowd gathered  
inside professor Len Kleinrock's lab at the University of 
California, Los Angeles to watch as meaningless bits of information 
silently flowed along a 15-foot cable between two bulky computers. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a test of the technology that remains the foundation of  
the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``In those early days, Len Kleinrock and his colleagues couldn't  
possibly have foreseen that they were on the ground floor of one of 
the most life-altering innovations of this century,'' said UCLA 
Chancellor Albert Carnesale. 
</P>
<P>
	But the anniversary celebration did not focus on how the first  
connection evolved into a global network. Instead, researchers and 
business people spoke about its future. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an exciting time to be alive,'' said Kleinrock, still  
a UCLA computer science professor. ``We're just beginning to move 
out of the stone age of the Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some company officials suggested that in the future the Internet  
should become an invisible force, something that works behind the 
scenes to carry information to people. 
</P>
<P>
	``A user does not understand what is happening behind the  
computer screen,'' said George Vradenburg III, senior vice 
president of global and strategic policy for America Online Inc. 
``The future is in the art of making it disappear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty years ago, hardly anybody outside Kleinrock's lab noticed  
when the first network test succeeded. The project grew from the 
needs of the Defense Department's Advance Research Projects Agency, 
which was formed after the Soviet Union's 1957 launch of Sputnik, 
the first manmade satellite to orbit the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials wanted a fast and efficient way of sharing information  
between research centers. The network needed to be decentralized so 
that that one failure would not kill the system. And the computers 
needed to speak a common language of data chopped into packets, 
each labeled with instructions on where to go and how to be 
reassembled. 
</P>
<P>
	Kleinrock pioneered the technology, later known as packet  
switching, as a graduate student at Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology. He wrote the first paper on the subject in 1961. He 
became a professor at UCLA in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1969, ARPA chose his lab for the first test communication  
between a host computer and an Interface Message Processor. The IMP 
would act as a translator between the local computers and the 
network. 
</P>
<P>
	After the first test, the network quickly grew. By the end of  
1969, four sites had been connected: UCLA, the Stanford Research 
Institute, UC Santa Barbara and the University of Utah. The number 
increased to 10 within seven months. 
</P>
<P>
	Applications like e-mail and file transfer utilities emerged in  
subsequent years, but it was not until the late 1980s, when the 
World Wide Web appeared, the network became a force not only in 
research but also in commerce and culture. 
</P>
<P>
	The refrigerator-size IMP was decommissioned in the 1980s. It  
made a rare public appearance outside the 30th anniversary 
conference, its rows of lights dark and its battleship gray case 
opened, exposing wires, fans and other components.

<HEADLINE> Russia Mulls Y2K Missile Monitoring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russia has agreed to consider a U.S. proposal  
for placing Russian representatives at a monitoring center in 
Colorado designed to reassure Moscow that the Year 2000 computer 
glitch won't trigger unintended U.S. missile launches, Pentagon 
officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen is expected to discuss the  
proposal with his Russian counterpart during a trip to Moscow in 
mid-September, said the officials, who discussed the matter on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	One official said it appeared likely the Russians would agree to  
participate in the monitoring project. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon had invited Moscow to send representatives to the  
Y2K Center for Strategic Stability in Colorado Springs, but the 
dialogue was interrupted when Moscow froze contacts during the NATO 
air war against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen had hoped to discuss this and other defense-related issues  
with Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev in August but his 
planned trip was put off at the Russians' request. The Pentagon has 
not yet officially announced the September trip.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Said To Offer To Buy House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN, N.Y. (AP) -- The vacationing President Clinton and his  
wife have made a bid on a Georgian colonial house they toured last 
weekend in a New York City suburb, according to sources familiar 
with the Clintons' hunt for a post-White House residence. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're involved in trying to secure that house, in trying to  
buy it,'' a source familiar with the negotiations said Wednesday. 
``They've made some progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons offered less than the nearly $1.7 million asking  
price, but sources would not detail the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple spent two hours touring the 110-year-old Westchester  
County house on a little more than an acre of parklike grounds. The 
house is near golf courses and boasts a swimming pool, lush 
landscaping and an exercise room on the top floor. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials demurred when pressed for details, saying  
they didn't want to complicate negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any mystery here,'' said White House  
spokesman Jake Siewert. ``The president and first lady said they 
liked the House that they saw in Chappaqua.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The house apparently passed security muster this week. The  
Secret Service checked out the house with an eye to protecting 
Clinton when he is a private citizen. Former presidents have a 
small security detail. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Clintons toured historic sites in upstate New  
York while taking time out for plenty of glad-handing with locals 
who might one day help elect Mrs. Clinton their senator. 
</P>
<P>
	The museum tour was heavy on sites honoring 19th century women  
who fought to free slaves and to gain voting rights. The Clintons 
drew crowds at every stop on a five-hour sightseeing trip of the 
Finger Lakes region, where the family is spending the final week of 
their summer vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're off on an excursion,'' Clinton said as the couple set  
out after coffee at a cafe in the village of Skaneateles. They are 
staying at a borrowed estate just outside the village of restored 
Victorian houses and shops that cater to summer crowds of boaters 
and sightseers. 
</P>
<P>
	Their stay is part relaxation and part political maneuvering, as  
Mrs. Clinton calculates whether to mount a formal campaign for a 
Senate seat in New York next year. She scheduled two fund-raising 
parties later today for her exploratory campaign committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The family's 16-day vacation in Massachusetts and New York was  
punctuated by political fund raising that will yield an estimated 
$800,000 for her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Clintons held hands while a guide at the  
Harriet Tubman Home museum in Auburn described how the escaped 
slave made 19 trips back to the South to lead 300 others to 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton was given a T-shirt with a quotation from Tubman,  
whose bravery and clever use of the ``Underground Railroad'' 
network of safehouses and escape routes earned her the nickname 
``Moses of her people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you are tired, keep going. If you are scared, keep going.  
If you are hungry, keep going. If you want to taste freedom, keep

<HEADLINE> Lawton, Fan To Exchange Apologies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Minnesota Twins outfielder Matt Lawton will  
likely get off with an apology, and not be charged, after being 
caught on videotape spitting at a teen-age fan at the SkyDome. 
</P>
<P>
	It happened during the seventh inning of the Twins' 14-3 victory  
over Toronto on Tuesday night. Lawton, while running down a foul 
ball, was heckled by several fans. According to published reports, 
when a 16-year-old made a particularly insulting remark, Lawton 
spat towards him. 
</P>
<P>
	The fan then threw an empty cup at Lawton as the outfielder  
returned to his position. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your next paycheck is coming to me,'' the spectator yelled  
back at Lawton according to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident was caught on videotape by TSN. The tape appears to  
show Lawton spitting toward the fan, but is inconclusive as to 
whether the fan was hit. The fan reportedly claims he was struck in 
the face. The tape also shows the fan made what appeared to be an 
obscene gesture to Lawton before the spitting incident. 
</P>
<P>
	A Toronto police spokesman said he received a call Wednesday  
night from the Twins telling him that they had settled the matter 
with the boy's family. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I do something wrong there's always punishment involved.  
I just want to make sure this doesn't happen again,'' Sgt. Peter 
Harmsen said the boy told him when he was deciding whether to press 
charges or not. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm satisfied there was an assault, but you need a complainant  
to go to court,'' Harmsen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Star Tribune reported Lawton has been told by the Twins not  
to comment on the matter, but did say Wednesday that ``It takes a 
lot to make me snap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked if the fan made a racial slur, Lawton, who is black,  
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Lawton) was taking a lot of abuse from the punks out there,''  
said a man sitting nearby. ``But it was nothing personal, it was 
just stuff like `you suck' when there was a fly ball.''

	``The investigation is over and done with,'' Sgt. David Bowen

<HEADLINE> Y2K Bug Still Buzzing Dallas Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAPEVINE, Texas (AP) -- Despite two years and nearly $8 million  
in preparations, 30 systems at Dallas-Fort Worth International 
Airport -- including runway lights -- are not yet protected against 
possible Y2K glitches, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	A board at the nation's third-busiest airport voted hastily on  
Thursday to spend an additional $300,000 on the computerized 
lighting system, which directs pilots to assigned runways. The 
lights change to indicate wind direction. 
</P>
<P>
	Airport officials said the runway system could be operated  
manually if needed, and said the airport will be safe on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be in good shape at DFW,'' said Jeffrey Fegan, the  
airport's executive director. ``Passengers have nothing to worry 
about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The concern over the Y2K bug centers on the fact that many  
computers were originally programmed to recognize only the last two 
digits of the year, so some might not be able to differentiate 
between 2000 and 1900. Unless they are reprogrammed in time, 
computers could malfunction. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Browne, who directs a Y2K-compliance project for the Air  
Transport Association, which represents airlines, said about half 
the airports still have some computer fixes to make but predicted 
no problems on New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
	``So much money and effort is being poured into this, it's going  
to be a great big yawn on Jan. 1,'' Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas airport had earlier identified 108 systems that could  
be vulnerable to Y2K problems due to older computers or software. 
Of those, 78 are prepared, but the others are still being repaired 
or tested, said Bob Hendricks, the airport's computer systems 
chief. 
</P>
<P>
	Remaining problems include the airport's two-way radio system,  
which may allow overlapping conversations or interference as the 
new year dawns. The system will otherwise work, Hendricks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, a new security system that controls access to restricted  
areas such as jetways and ramps has been installed but is not yet 
operational, airport officials say. Police officers would be posted 
at the affected doors if the system fails, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration has jurisdiction over  
air-traffic control systems and security equipment at airports. 
</P>
<P>
	Fegan said DFW will have all airport systems ready by Oct. 30.  
</P>
<P>
	But ``we'll all be out here Dec. 31 just to make sure everything  
goes smoothly,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Doctor Charged With Punching Woman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAGAN, Minn. (AP) -- A doctor was accused of punching a  
69-year-old woman in the face and telling her to ``get off the 
road'' after she pulled in front of his sports car on a highway 
entrance ramp. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas J. Valente was charged Wednesday with one count of  
fifth-degree assault, a misdemeanor charge that carries a maximum 
penalty of 90 days in jail and a $700 fine. A Sept. 23 arraignment 
was scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	A witness saw Virginia Hendrickson turn onto a highway ramp in  
front of Valente's white BMW Z3 convertible Aug. 11, nearly causing 
an accident, according to the complaint. Valente, 41, allegedly 
pulled in front of Hendrickson's car, got out of his car and struck 
her in the face. Then he drove off. 
</P>
<P>
	Hendrickson told state troopers that when she turned onto the  
ramp she thought she might have cut off another vehicle but wasn't 
sure. When the driver stopped, she did, too, thinking she might 
have hit his car, the complaint said. The other driver swore at 
her, told her to ``get off the road'' and then punched her, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Valente, an anesthesiologist, has an office in Minneapolis and  
practices in Twin Cities hospitals. Neither Valente nor his lawyer 
returned telephone calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Leach, executive director of the Minnesota Board of  
Medical Practice, said he couldn't comment on whether the board was 
investigating Valente. But he said in general, such an assault is 
not a violation of the medical malpractice act but could be 
investigated to see if it was a sign of a mental impairment that 
would endanger patients. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Valente had never been disciplined by the board in the  
past.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Minister Sentenced for Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A California clergyman who used scripture on the  
goodness of profit to take followers for $1.4 million in a pyramid 
scheme was sentenced Thursday to nearly four years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Groeschel, who ran the Association of Individual  
Ministries under the name Pastor Chuck, pleaded guilty to mail and 
wire fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to express my remorse and state I'm sad to end  
my life this way, ashamed of it,'' the white-haired preacher said 
in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Groeschel, 67, of Palm Desert, Calif., was sentenced to three  
years and 10 months in prison for a pyramid scheme based in Palm 
Desert, Calif. in which he told followers they could make millions 
of dollars in a year. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997 and 1998, he collected more than $1.4 million from about  
2,000 lower-income individuals, many of them residents of New York 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Groeschel carried out the criminal scheme in  
the name of God, quoting lines from the Bible that indicate profit 
is not a bad thing. One Biblical passage promised ``we will receive 
a hundred fold return in this life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although promising some contributors 15 percent profit on  
contributions, Groeschel allegedly kept most of the money, 
transferring more than $237,000 to an overseas account in the 
Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Allen G. Schwartz said Groeschel betrayed  
those who were committed to religion and demonstrated the same 
behavior that caused him on May 13, 1993 to be convicted by a jury 
in New Mexico of promoting an illegal pyramid scheme. He was 
sentenced in that case to a year and a half in prison.

<HEADLINE> Vitamins Might Ward Off Toxemia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Women at high risk for toxemia, one of the most  
dangerous complications of pregnancy, might avoid the condition by 
taking vitamin C and E pills, new research suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	But the British scientists who conducted the study -- the first  
to investigate the vitamins' potential to prevent the condition 
also known as pre-eclampsia -- warned that pregnant women should not 
rush to start taking large doses of the vitamins, since the 
findings are preliminary. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers haven't even yet determined if the high doses are  
safe for the developing fetus. 
</P>
<P>
	The benefit suggested by the study must be confirmed in  
large-scale experiments, said lead researcher Lucilla Poston, a 
professor who runs the fetal health research group at Guy's, King's 
and St. Thomas' School of Medicine in London. 
</P>
<P>
	Toxemia, which occurs in about 5 percent of pregnancies, is a  
potentially fatal condition in which blood vessels throughout the 
body and womb constrict, reducing the amount of the mother's blood 
that reaches the fetus. 
</P>
<P>
	It develops late in pregnancy and produces a sudden rise in  
blood pressure and swelling. If untreated, it can progress to 
convulsions, bleeding in the mother's brain, liver or kidney, and 
force early delivery to save the mother and child. 
</P>
<P>
	Women at higher risk include older or very young mothers, those  
in their first pregnancy, those carrying twins and women who are 
overweight or have diabetes, high blood-pressure or blood-clotting 
disorders. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists believe toxemia of pregnancy could be connected to  
the damage oxygen does to the blood vessels and to impaired 
activity of antioxidants, substances that fight the attacks of 
oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
	Poston's study of 160 pregnant women at high risk for the  
condition, published in this week's issue of The Lancet, a British 
medical journal, found that taking 1,000 milligrams of vitamin C 
and 400 International Units -- the measure that some vitamin 
supplements are quoted in -- of vitamin E daily cut the chances of 
toxemia by 76 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Such high doses are fairly common in some supplements, but they  
are many times higher than the recommended intake for pregnant 
women. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the 79 women taking the vitamins, or 8 percent, developed  
the condition; 21 of the 81 taking the fake tablets, or 26 percent, 
experienced the complication. 
</P>
<P>
	``This finding is both encouraging and frightening,'' James  
Roberts, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh who is 
unconnected with the study, wrote in a critique for The Lancet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Encouraging from the perspective that it suggests a rational  
target for larger clinical trials,'' Roberts wrote. ``Frightening 
because the suggested benefit will undoubtedly lead to adoption of 
the strategy without well-established evidence of benefit and with 
minimal evidence of safety for the infant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He cited the apparent promise of aspirin and calcium  
supplements, which seemed to work in small early studies but proved 
unsuccessful when investigated further. 
</P>
<P>
	Studies have shown that pregnant women with toxemia have lower  
levels of antioxidants such as vitamins C and E in their blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Research also has indicated that women who already have  
pre-eclampsia and are given vitamin C and E supplements to boost 
their antioxidant activity suffer less oxygen damage to their 
placenta than those not given the vitamins. 
</P>
<P>
	Poston found a similar improvement in an indicator for  
antioxidant activity in her study, which supports the theory that 
oxygen damage is at least partly responsible for pre-eclampsia. But 
scientists don't know what effect the vitamins would have on 
pregnant women who are unlikely to experience the complication 
anyway, she said.

<HEADLINE> Vegas Strip Gets French-Theme Hotel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Thousands applauded as the great grandson of  
the Eiffel Tower's designer lighted a 50-story replica of the 
famous French landmark on the Las Vegas Strip, heralding the 
opening of the new $785 million Paris Las Vegas hotel-casino. 
</P>
<P>
	The megaresort, which opened late Wednesday, is the latest of  
four to open here in the past 11 months, with Bellagio opening in 
October, Mandalay Bay in March and The Venetian in May. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's wrong with re-creating the most wonderful city God ever  
created?'' Arthur Goldberg, chairman of parent Park Place 
Entertainment Corp., told a midday news conference Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldberg pitched the idea of a Paris re-creation five years ago  
when discussing with company executives a new resort on a valuable 
piece of land next to their Bally's hotel-casino. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldberg said the resort came in on time and on budget. The  
price -- Bellagio cost $1.6 billion, The Venetian $1.5 billion and 
Mandalay Bay nearly $1 billion -- has been a hit with casino 
analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Ader, senior managing director for Bear Stearns, said  
Paris should generate the highest annual return on capital invested 
among the four new resorts -- 14 percent to 16 percent versus 10 
percent to 13 percent for the other three. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paris is an exciting and amenity-rich property that was a  
bargain to develop -- by Vegas standards,'' Ader said. ``In recent 
years, Vegas hotel-casino building costs have soared as owners 
created lavish themes to lure visitors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The opening comes at a time when numbers are bullish for Las  
Vegas, despite concerns a year ago about overbuilding. The new 
resorts added 13,000 new rooms since October 1998, bringing the 
total to 120,000 -- nearly double a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Ader said the daily hotel room rates have increased an average  
of 15 percent to 20 percent in 1999, with casino revenues and 
visitor volume on the rise. The visitor count is expected to be up 
10 percent to 12 percent this year, surpassing 33 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The French-themed resort is just the latest replicating famous  
places. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past decade, the town has seen the emergence of the  
Caribbean-like Mirage, the medieval Excalibur, the pyramid-shaped 
Luxor, Hollywood's MGM Grand, pirate-themed Treasure Island, 
Mediterranean-styled Monte Carlo, Gotham knockoff New York-New 
York, Brazilian-cloned Rio, Italian-themed Bellagio, South 
Seas-styled Mandalay Bay, the Resort at Summerlin and a touch of 
Venice in The Venetian. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eiffel Tower is not the only French icon copied at Paris Las  
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Guests arrive on a circular drive featuring a two-thirds replica  
of the Arc de Triomphe. There are also copies of the Paris Opera 
House and The Louvre. And the 34-story hotel replicates the 
800-year-old Hotel de Ville, which is now the Paris City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Room rates will run $125 to $230.

<HEADLINE> Minor Quake Shakes N. Illinois </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DIXON, Ill. (AP) -- An earthquake rippled through northern  
Illinois on Thursday, shaking pictures off walls and causing some 
buildings to wobble. 
</P>
<P>
	``We sure felt it. It sure shook the building,'' said Shirley  
Speer, executive secretary at the Dixon Area Chamber of Commerce 
and Industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said there were no immediate reports of damage or  
injuries from the quake, which occurred at 11:17 a.m. and had a 
preliminary magnitude of 3.5, according to the U.S. Geological 
Survey. 
</P>
<P>
	The epicenter was 10 miles south-southeast of Dixon, about 90  
miles west of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Some thought the vibration was due to passing trucks. Jane  
Lovgren, a clerk at the Amboy Pharmacy, also said she didn't feel a 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're tearing the heck out of the bank next store. They're  
using a jackhammer, so that's probably why we missed it,'' Lovgren 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seth Stein, a professor of geological sciences at Northwestern  
University, said a light quake occurs about once a year somewhere 
in the Midwest.

<HEADLINE> Montreal's Molson Centre Up for Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Saying it is tired of paying high property  
taxes, beer giant Molson Inc. wants to sell the Molson Centre, a 
21,273-seat arena built for its Montreal Canadiens franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief executive James Arnett made the announcement late Thursday  
at a news conference where businessman Pierre Boivin was named the 
new president of the NHL team. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnett also confirmed that Molson will keep the Canadiens, and  
gave Boivin a mandate to improve its financial and on-ice 
performance. The landmark arena in downtown Montreal was completed 
in 1996 at a cost to the beer company of $235 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related move, Molson is also seeking buyers for its 50 per  
cent interest in Universal Concerts Canada and Molstar TV 
Productions. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnett said selling the large arena is one option; the company  
could also seek a financial partner or refinance it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not strategically important for us to own it,'' said  
Arnett, noting that Molson did not own the Canadiens' previous 
legendary home, the Montreal Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnett claimed that the Molson Centre pays the highest city  
taxes of any similar arena in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	Molson's sports and entertainment division lost $3.7 million in  
the first quarter ended June 30, compared with a profit of $3.4 
million in the same period in 1998. This can be attributed mainly 
to five home playoff games the Canadiens played in 1998, while in 
1999 the team did not make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, Molson has sold off its non-brewing assets, and  
bought back the 50 per cent of the brewery it didn't own. However, 
Arnett said the company has decided that the hockey club ``is a 
criticial strategic asset to our core business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bovin, whose career was in the sporting goods industry, has been  
ordered ``to enhance the relationship between the Molson and 
Canadiens brands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also becomes executive vice-president at Molson Inc.

<HEADLINE> Online Kidney Auction Stopped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The bidding for a human kidney offered on  
the Internet auction site eBay hit $5.7 million before the company 
put a stop to it Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	EBay spokesman Kevin Pursglove said he had no idea if the  
offering was for real, but the auction was stopped because the 
seller broke eBay's rules outlawing the sale of body parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Selling one's own organs is also illegal under federal law. It  
is punishable by up to five years in prison or a $50,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you have an open trading environment with almost 6  
million registered users, you're likely to see somebody who tries 
to bend the rules, or to pull a prank on their fellow users,'' 
Pursglove said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seller, identified as ``hchero'' from Sunrise, Fla., started  
the bidding at $25,000 on Aug. 26. A message sent to his e-mail 
address was not immediately answered. 
</P>
<P>
	The description read: ``Fully functional kidney for sale. You  
can choose either kidney. Buyer pays all transplant and medical 
costs. Of course only one for sale, as I need the other one to 
live. Serious bids only.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Thomas Reardon, president of the American Medical  
Association, said he was taken aback when he heard about the kidney 
auction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wow. Well, first of all, I'd question the ethics of any doctor  
who would participate in that kind of transaction,'' Reardon said. 
``Second of all, it's illegal to sell organs in this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	EBay has no system to spot questionable offers, instead relying  
on users to notify the company, Pursglove said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We get items we have to take down on a fairly frequent basis.  
From time to time, we'll get a kidney or a liver,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, a group of engineers tried to auction themselves as  
``high-priced, professionally trained cybergeeks'' for $3.14 
million. The group stopped its own auction without explanation, but 
not before receiving a number of bids. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, San Jose-based eBay banned the sale of guns  
and ammunition on the site, after people tried selling a missile, a 
bazooka, a rocket launcher and other military weapons.

<HEADLINE> IOC Panel Recommends Bid Visit Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- International Olympic Committee members might be  
given the chance to visit bidding cities, but only under strict 
conditions, a reform panel recommended Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A working group of the IOC 2000 reform commission decided that  
members on some occasions might feel the need for viewing bidding 
cities, and there should not be an absolute ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Visits were banned after disclosures of vote-buying in the  
selection of Salt Lake City for the 2002 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things we discussed was if, for example, there was  
a bid from a city that has never hosted the games, and that city 
may have a very low profile but in actuality is a very strong 
candidate,'' Anita DeFrantz, the IOC vice president who heads the 
working group, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Visits would go ahead only ``if the IOC deems it necessary,''  
and under very strong conditions designed to prevent members 
accepting lavish hospitality. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the members themselves would be allowed to go -- in  
organized groups, not individually -- and not their spouses or other 
members of their family, said DeFrantz. 
</P>
<P>
	They would be allowed to go only once, and the trips would take  
place within a specific time frame, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz said it was not yet clear whether, in such  
circumstances, members also would be allowed to visit all the 
bidding cities or only the ones where it was ``deemed necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ten IOC members resigned or were expelled because of the Salt  
Lake City scandal after they or members of their family were found 
to have accepted hospitality, gifts, medical care and job offers, 
apparently as a bribe to obtain their votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve cities have expressed interest in bidding for the 2008  
Olympics. The decision will be made at an IOC meeting in Moscow in 
September 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The working party will formally present its recommendations at a  
meeting of the IOC 2000 commission Sept. 25, and the report from 
that session will be taken to an IOC meeting in December.

<HEADLINE> Mets Have Altercation on Team Bus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Mets shortstop Rey Ordonez needed six  
stitches over his left eye after a fight with fellow infielder Luis 
Lopez early Thursday morning on the team bus. 
</P>
<P>
	Ordonez is listed as day to day, general manager Steve Phillips  
said. Lopez, a reserve infielder, was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel confident that this is something that has been resolved  
on their basis and is behind us,'' Phillips said. ``This is one of 
those things that can happen when players are together over 162 
games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fight occurred about 4 a.m. EDT as the team bus was  
traveling from Newark Airport back to Shea Stadium. The Mets 
concluded a 3-3 road trip with a win at Houston on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Ordonez, 26, was treated at the Hospital for Special Surgery.  
</P>
<P>
	Both players met separately and together Thursday with Phillips  
and senior assistant general manager Omar Minaya. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is something that seems to have been quickly resolved in a  
short afternoon meeting that I am confident is behind us,'' 
Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	The team would not disclose the nature of the fight or if either  
player was disciplined.

<HEADLINE> Japan, S. Korea Discuss N. Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on Thursday  
held out the prospect of multilateral cooperation with North Korea 
if it forgoes testing a long-range missile. 
</P>
<P>
	``If North Korea freezes the launch of another missile it is  
possible Japan, South Korea and the United States can promote 
relations with it in a forward-looking manner,'' Obuchi said at a 
joint news conference with visiting South Korean Prime Minister Kim 
Jong-pil. 
</P>
<P>
	Obuchi did not elaborate, but said such a development would be  
``beneficial'' to North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, who arrived Wednesday on a five-day official visit, said he  
hopes that a ``good outcome'' will emerge from a new round of talks 
between U.S. and North Korean officials scheduled for Sept. 7-11 in 
Berlin, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim also reiterated that Tokyo and Seoul will work closely with  
Washington to persuade the North not to carry out a missile test. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev and his  
South Korean counterpart, Cho Sung-tae, agreed to work closely to 
stop North Korea from launching a new ballistic missile. 
</P>
<P>
	``Confirming that another North Korean missile launch poses a  
threat to peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and in 
Northeast Asia, the ministers agreed to closely cooperate to curb 
it,'' the two said in a joint news release after their meeting in 
Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no explanations about how the two countries would  
cooperate. But Sergeyev said recently that Moscow was trying to 
convince North Korea through political and diplomatic channels to 
give up the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Reclusive North Korea shocked Japan, South Korea and other  
countries in the region last August, when it test-fired a missile 
that sailed over Japan and into the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	Western officials have said the launch was a test of a Taepodong  
missile that is capable of reaching any part of the Japanese 
archipelago. North Korea has claimed it launched a satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts believe the North may try to test fire another more  
advanced missile capable of reaching as far as Alaska or Hawaii, 
though recently the nation has hinted a launch may not be imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	In nearly 90 minutes of talks, Kim and Obuchi also agreed to  
soon begin full-fledged negotiations to hammer out a bilateral 
treaty aimed at bolstering investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Obuchi said that the two leaders also agreed to further promote  
cultural, academic and youth exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that officials will consider ways to strengthen air  
transportation links between the Japan and South Korea during the 
World Cup soccer tournament in 2002. The two nations will co-host 
the event. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim is scheduled to meet with Emperor Akihito on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Oklahomans Say They've Won $23M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOULD, Okla. (AP) -- Banker Rick Holder was out on his cattle  
ranch over the weekend when a friend called with some news: The 
friend was suddenly rich. 
</P>
<P>
	The caller, Jimmy Pendergraft, told him that Pendergraft and 11  
other friends had bought the winning ticket in the $23 million 
Texas Lottery jackpot drawn Saturday night. The caller wanted to 
leave the ticket at Holder's bank for safekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't believe him for a while,'' Holder said Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	The reality of winning a fortune is slowly sinking in for the 12  
men and women in this 250-resident town of decaying storefronts and 
parched brown fields. 
</P>
<P>
	After suffering through last year's drought, the worst since the  
Great Depression, those who tend the cotton and alfalfa fields here 
saw their crops wiped out by a spring hail storm. Others have too 
much cotton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nearly everybody on that list needed money,'' said Randy  
Mefford, another winner who owns and operates one of the largest 
farming operations in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	The pool began about five years ago, when the lottery hit $50  
million. The group agreed to buy tickets, but only if the pot was 
at least $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``This really started off being just a game, a conversation  
piece. It's something to talk about,'' said Pendergraft. The group 
agreed to spend between $120 and $140 each time. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Macom, who lives in a trailer on his parents' property in  
nearby Eldorado, purchased $120 worth of tickets at a gas station 
in Quanah, Texas, about 10 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	On his return, he left the tickets on the dashboard of his  
truck. 
</P>
<P>
	When Macom got an excited wake up call early Sunday, he rushed  
to retrieve the winning $1 ticket and verified the numbers. Then he 
promptly woke up Pendergraft. 
</P>
<P>
	From there, word soon trickled down to other winners.  
</P>
<P>
	Bonofasio Olguin, a farm laborer who also works for Mefford, was  
out in the field picking cotton when he found out. Olguin had 
rolled pennies so he could get in on the pool. 
</P>
<P>
	Holder, the president of Stockman's Bank, placed the winning  
ticket in the vault that morning, Pendergraft said. It has since 
been moved, but Pendergraft wouldn't say where. 
</P>
<P>
	It could be at least three weeks before the group can collect  
their fortune. They opted for an early cash out, and after taxes 
could only end up with about $500,000 each, Pendergraft said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Mefford and Pendergraft were back at work at the  
country store on Highway 5 as if nothing had happened. Both men, 
who have lived with risk all their lives in southwestern Oklahoma, 
said they don't believe much will change. 
</P>
<P>
	``Farming is a little bit of a gamble,'' said Mefford, 45, who  
plans to use the winnings to get out of debt. ``You put so many 
dollars into a crop and you have no idea how it's going to come 
out.''

<HEADLINE> Radiation Panel Makeup Protested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The threat of cancer from large amounts of  
nuclear radiation is clear. But will small doses over many years 
put people at risk? 
</P>
<P>
	A panel of scientists formed to answer the question has become  
entangled in controversy even before its work begins, with critics 
charging too many of the scientists are tied to the nuclear 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``A campaign is under way to further relax already weak  
radiation protection standards,'' more than 130 environmental, 
health and anti-nuclear activists wrote the National Academy of 
Sciences this week, protesting the composition of the review 
committee, which was holding its first meeting today. 
</P>
<P>
	The academy's National Research Council, which selected the  
scientists for the three-year study, added five member. One 
scientist was forced to withdraw because of the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	Evan Douple, director of the council's radiation studies branch,  
called the composition of the panel ``balanced'' and said in a 
recent interview that the scientists have the expertise to examine 
the issue ``from a scientific point of view without politics and 
without bias.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some scientists who have been involved in low-dose radiation  
studies say the panel still is heavily skewed to the view that 
current assumptions about low-dose radiation overstate the health 
risks. Some of the members have asserted no radiation harm can be 
found below a certain threshold, contrary to existing dogma. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very lopsided committee with predictable outcome,''  
said Rudi Nussbaum, professor emeritus of physics and environmental 
sciences at Portland State University. 
</P>
<P>
	Nussbaum was one of eight scientists who complained in a letter  
to the Academy that the panel ``is dominated by individuals whose 
work has been conducted within institutional settings heavily 
influenced by organizations with interests in the nuclear 
industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the scientists said, the panel ``does not  
include a significant number of persons who have demonstrated 
independence from this institutional setting'' including a number 
of scientists whose studies have suggested elevated cancer levels 
from low-dose radiation exposure. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides agree much is at stake in the three-year study.  
</P>
<P>
	Formally known as the Committee on Biological Effects of  
Ionizing Radiation, or BEIR, the panel's findings are likely to 
have tremendous impact on radiation levels the government will 
allowed at abandoned nuclear power plants, in the cleanup of 
nuclear weapons production facilities and at nuclear waste disposal 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The nuclear industry has long argued that the adverse health  
effects from low-dose radiation have not been scientifically shown 
and that current maximum radiation exposure levels may be higher 
than what is needed to protect public health. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., asked for the General  
Accounting Office in Congress to review whether radiation standards 
could be eased. ``If radiation protection standards are 
unnecessarily restrictive, the impact on the cost of (nuclear) 
waste disposals, power plant decommissioning and decontamination 
and environmental cleanup could be huge,'' said Dominici. 
</P>
<P>
	Current risk assessments on low-dose radiation are made by  
extrapolating from the increased cancers observed from exposure to 
high doses, principally among victims of the World War II atomic 
bomb blasts in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	This approach adopted by past BEIR committees assumes that risks  
from low doses follow a ``linear'' model with the risks declining 
as dose levels decline, but that each unit of radiation, no matter 
how small, still is assumed to cause cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	But some scientists, including many of the new BEIR review  
panel, contend the linear theory overstates the cancer risks and 
that, as a result, the radiation exposure levels may, in fact, be 
too stringent. A number of the panel members have testified for 
industry in radiation exposure cases or challenged studies 
suggesting elevated cancers from low-dose radiation exposure, the 
critics said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The BEIR committee has been loaded up with people from this  
side of the debate,'' complained Daniel Hirsch, executive director 
of Committee to Bridge the Gap, a California-based anti-nuclear 
watchdog group. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kenneth Mossman, a professor of health physics at Arizona  
State University who was dropped from the panel after becoming a 
prime target of the critics' attacks, said panel members represent 
a variety of opinions and a ``centrist'' view of the issue.

<HEADLINE> Belluzzo To Run Microsoft Net Unit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. named Richard Belluzzo, the  
former head of Silicon Graphics Inc., to lead its Internet business 
in a battle against rival behemoths such as America Online Inc. and 
Yahoo! 
</P>
<P>
	Belluzzo has been enlisted ``to help step our online business up  
to the next level,'' Microsoft President Steve Ballmer said in a 
telephone interview from the company's Redmond, Wash., 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft has had mixed success competing on the Internet. Its  
Web investments include sites devoted to travel and personal 
finance, but the company has backed off from some ventures. Earlier 
this year it sold its city arts and entertainment guide, Sidewalk, 
to Ticketmaster Online-Citysearch for $240 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Belluzzo's appointment Thursday by Microsoft confirms reports  
that followed Belluzzo's sudden resignation from Silicon Graphics 
last week. Belluzzo, 45, became chief executive of Silicon Graphics 
early last year and led its transformation from a maker of powerful 
computers that use proprietary technology to ones that run on 
Microsoft Windows operating program and Intel microprocessor chips. 
</P>
<P>
	Belluzzo also is a 22-year veteran of Hewlett-Packard Corp.,  
where he rose to the No. 2 job before leaving for Silicon Graphics. 
</P>
<P>
	He now will oversee Microsoft's Consumer and Commerce Group.  
Brad Chase and Jon DeVaan, who had jointly headed the unit since 
its formation in March, will report to him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet ``is still in its infancy. There are tremendous  
opportunities to build on that over the next several years,'' 
Belluzzo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's Consumer and Commerce Group was formed as part of a  
reorganization announced in March in response to competitive 
pressure and the need to exploit Internet opportunities. The unit 
includes the Microsoft Network, the company's Internet service.

<HEADLINE> Pan American Airways Gets an OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTSMOUTH, N.H. (AP) -- Pan American Airways, at one point one  
of the world's largest air carriers before falling upon hard times, 
has received final federal approval to resume regular passenger 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	The new service will be based at Pease International Tradeport,  
site of the old Pease Air Force Base, the first of several military 
bases to close in the early 1990s to save money. 
</P>
<P>
	Pan Am president Dave Fink said details of the new service are  
being worked out and will be announced soon. Initially, Pan Am will 
fly from Pease to Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The original Pan Am World Airways began flying in 1927 and grew  
into one of the world's largest airlines. It shut down in 1991 
following the terrorist bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, which 
killed 270 people in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	The discount carrier that followed never turned a profit,  
serving 14 cities in Florida, the Northeast, Midwest and Puerto 
Rico before filing for bankruptcy in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Guilford Transportation Industries Inc., a New England railroad  
operator, bought the airline's name, jets, parts and flight 
certificates for $28.5 million in June 1998.

<HEADLINE> Wildfire Roars Around Resort Towns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIG BEAR LAKE, Calif. (AP) -- Firefighters battled back flames  
from huge wildfires that roared around mountain resort towns on 
Thursday as hotel owners and shopkeepers feared the pall of smoke 
would kill their usually prosperous Labor Day business. 
</P>
<P>
	Closed campgrounds and a canceled carnival had merchants  
worrying about the impact on tourism on the last holiday weekend of 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tiny hamlet of Fawnskin on the north side of the lake,  
Barb Aker, owner of Gold Pan Dining, filled salt shakers in her 
empty restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will affect business big time,'' Mrs. Aker said. ``It's  
very, very slow. There's no traffic at all. Normally cars are 
piling in by now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The West's largest blaze, the 60,100-acre Willow fire 90 miles  
east of Los Angeles, threatened to derail a couple's planned 
nuptials at this scenic resort. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people coming to the wedding are scared to come up,''  
said Ken Nairne, 40, of Borrego Springs as he ordered flowers for 
Saturday's ceremony. ``We were worried we'd have to cancel the 
wedding. We were all freaking out but we're handling it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Nairne spoke, a wall of smoke hung over a ridge some six  
miles to the northwest and a steady stream of helicopters dipped 
buckets into the lake, scooping up to 900 gallons. More than 2,200 
firefighters fought the fire, which was 35 percent contained. 
</P>
<P>
	The blaze was one of seven large California fires that burned  
about 125,000 acres of forest and desert land. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters got the upper hand in six other significant  
wildfires in Montana, Utah and Idaho, where a 35,118-acre grass 
blaze near the Snake River community of Glenns Ferry was contained 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Crews torched woodlands to deprive the fire of fuel and protect  
Green Valley, a tiny mountain town that canceled its annual water 
carnival for the Labor Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's pretty much on the back burner, I doubt we'll do  
anything,'' said Rod Peacock, who manages some 50 rental cabins. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything's OK so far, the fires did get pretty close  
yesterday,'' he said. ``If they kick up, we'll be in trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The blaze, which destroyed 12 desert homes in Apple Valley,  
started Saturday as a campfire in San Bernardino National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two of the area's 15 campgrounds will be open for the  
weekend, said Randy Clauson, fire battalion chief for the forest. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to make for a very slow weekend,'' said Damon  
Dennis, manager of Alpine Sports Center, which sells camping 
supplies. ``Usually we're very busy by now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Los Angeles County, some campgrounds in the Angeles National  
Forest were closed because of a 7,000-acre blaze near Azusa that 
was 35 percent contained. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 4,000 people were evacuated earlier in the week,  
including 160 homeless mothers and their children attending a camp 
sponsored by Planet Hope, a charity founded by actress Sharon Stone 
and her sister, Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was so smoky,'' Kelly Stone said. ``I was a little freaked  
out because we were on the top of that mountain, and we could see 
the smoke from all the fires.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Northern California, firefighters struggled with clusters of  
wildfires started by lightning storms on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27,100-acre High Complex fire in the Shasta-Trinity area --  
actually 19 lightning-ignited blazes burning in a cluster 22 miles 
north of Redding -- was 85 percent surrounded. Containment was 
expected Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Montana, rainfall on the Crow Indian Reservation helped  
subdue a small wildfire, and two others were declared controlled. 
All fires were sparked by lighting.

<HEADLINE> Virginia Slave Re-Enactors Complain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILLIAMSBURG, Va. (AP) -- Black actors who portray slaves at  
Colonial Willamsburg complain that they are being typecast, 
underpaid and denied advancement. 
</P>
<P>
	Colonial Williamsburg is a reconstructed colonial capital of  
houses, shops and cobblestone streets where employees in period 
costume portray 18th-century figures and teach visitors about life 
back then. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the black employees take part in an acclaimed program in  
which they play slaves, runaways and preachers. White employees 
sometimes portray slave masters who berate and intimidate their 
slaves in public. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, a group of black employees wrote a letter of  
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems as though with each restructuring, only one black at  
a time is promoted,'' the letter read. ``This leads us to believe 
that those in charge of programming are afraid if they promote too 
many of us, they won't have any `slaves' to make their programs 
successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Elliott, Colonial Williamsburg's vice president of  
education, said the organization has been meeting with the staff 
about the complaints and has created a forum, led by four employees 
who work on black history programs, that will look at such issues 
as hiring, staffing and sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have enough people to do the ambitious programming  
that we've set out for ourselves and it takes a toll on folks,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several black employees told Wednesday's Daily Press of Newport  
News that there has been increasing unhappiness among blacks since 
Colonial Williamsburg dissolved its Department of African American 
Interpretations and Presentations in 1997. The department was made 
up mostly of black employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Christy Matthews, who was director of the department, left  
Colonial Williamsburg last week, three months after a 
reorganization put her in charge of overseeing development of 
programs throughout the historic area. 
</P>
<P>
	``Morale, for a lot of interpreters, is the lowest I've ever  
seen,'' she told the Daily Press.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average is down 31  
points in today's early going. Losers on the New York Stock

<P>
	The Nasdaq Composite Index is down 36 points and the S&AMP;P 500

<HEADLINE> Griffith Is WNBA's Most Valuable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Yolanda Griffith of the Sacramento Monarch  
completed a triple on Wednesday when she was selected the WNBA's 
Most Valuable Player. 
</P>
<P>
	She earlier won the Newcomer of the Year and Defensive Player  
awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith beat out Sheryl Swoopes of the Houston Comets in the  
voting for the MVP award. 
</P>
<P>
	She received 397 points and 23 first-place votes. Swoopes got  
364 points and 15 first-place votes. Swoopes' Houston teammate, 
Cynthia Cooper, the MVP the first two years of the league's 
existence, got 324 points and 13 first-place votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yolanda is a great person and an exceptional ball player,''  
Cooper said. ``She deserves it. She brought Sacramento back. They 
had never had a winning record and they made the playoffs. She 
plays both ends of the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith averaged league-best averages of 11.3 rebounds and 2.52  
steals and also finished second in scoring (18.8 points a game) and 
field goal percentage (54.1). 
</P>
<P>
	The Monarchs, 8-22 last season, were 19-13 this season and lost  
to Los Angeles in the playoffs.

<HEADLINE> Dennis Weakens, Pummels Outer Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WAVES, N.C. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Dennis stumbled down the North  
Carolina coast, half the storm it was when it first spun into the 
Outer Banks earlier this week but still making life hard for 5,000 
people here. 
</P>
<P>
	The fragile barrier islands were lashed by 60 mph winds and  
14-foot waves as relief crews worked frantically to deliver 
supplies to thousands of stranded people. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton declared 50-mile-long Hatteras Island a  
disaster area and a National Guard convoy ferried meals to the 
island before ocean overwash forced them to turn back. 
</P>
<P>
	``Between Avon and Buxton, it's completely washed out,'' Sgt.  
Joe Baker of the National Guard said Wednesday while the convoy 
rushed to get off the island before high tide. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 5,000 people, mostly residents, stayed on Hatteras  
Island after officials ordered an evacuation Sunday, then were 
stuck when the island's only north-south highway, became 
impassable. 
</P>
<P>
	The convoy braved ocean overwash and 4-foot-deep sand to deliver  
3,700 ready-to-eat meals to three fire stations north of Avon 
before turning back. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing is getting the road clear so we can get some  
help to those people,'' said Sgt. Craig Garriss of the state 
Highway Patrol. ``They're in dire need of help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatteras Island was without electricity, telephone service and,  
in some cases, water because electric pumps were knocked out, 
Garriss said. In Hatteras village, ham radio operators reported 
extensive flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	A Coast Guard helicopter airlifted a pregnant Hatteras Island  
woman, 19-year-old Amber Simerly, to Albemarle Hospital in 
Elizabeth City, where she gave birth. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere on the Outer Banks, at least three cars were buried in  
sand up to their door handles in Nags Head. One cottage collapsed 
at Kitty Hawk, and five were reported destroyed at Rodanthe on 
Hatteras Island. 
</P>
<P>
	On Ocracoke Island flooding was widespread. Some 1,000 islanders  
remained without power, but ham radio operator Dale Mutro said 
everyone seemed to be getting along all right. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine coastal counties also were issued with federal disaster  
declarations Wednesday, meaning the government will cover 75 
percent of the cost of relief efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5 a.m. today, Dennis was nearly stationary, 110 miles east of  
Cape Hatteras, still lashing the barrier islands with gusty wind 
and high waves. No significant motion was expected today. 
</P>
<P>
	A tropical storm warning remained in effect from Surf City to  
Chincoteague, Va. A gale warning was in effect from Chincoteague to 
Fenwick Island, Del. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said Dennis, once a Category 2 hurricane, could be  
downgraded further but likely would linger off the North Carolina 
coast for days, moving to the southwest without making landfall. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's starting to spin down,'' James Franklin of the National  
Hurricane Center in Miami said. ``Not much more weakening is 
expected over the next two to three days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 120,000 to 150,000 people live along North  
Carolina's 320-mile coast, and the summer tourist influx swells the 
population to about half a million. 
</P>
<P>
	When Dennis brushed by the Outer Banks the first time,  
vacationers and residents were ordered to evacuate. Some returned 
when Dennis headed into the Atlantic, only to have to leave again 
when the storm returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Kinchner of Dover, Del., was one of the Nags Head  
vacationers who tried to stay. On Wednesday, he was packing up, 
strapping a grill, cooler and fishing rods to a rack on his sport 
utility vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were hoping to stick it out,'' he said, ``but it's  
futile.''

<HEADLINE> Ford Fined in Power Plant Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. will pay $7 million but not be  
held criminally responsible for a boiler explosion in which six 
workers died and 14 were injured, the state's top workplace safety 
regulator said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement includes a $1.5 million fine -- the largest ever  
levied by the Michigan Occupational Health and Safety 
Administration, said Kathy Wilbur, director of the state Department 
of Consumer and Industry Services. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 2 automaker also will finance new safety programs,  
medical research into burn treatment and set up a scholarship fund 
in memory of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``This historic agreement cannot reclaim lost lives. It cannot  
restore broken bodies,'' Ms. Wilbur said. ``But it can ease the 
suffering of the victims and their families by assuring a safer and 
healthier work environment for all Ford employees in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A seven-month investigation of the Feb. 1 explosion at Ford's  
Rouge complex in Dearborn revealed 15 workplace safety violations. 
The blast was caused by a buildup of natural gas in the boiler, 
which lacked adequate controls for shutting it down safely, 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old boiler was being shut down for routine monthly  
inspection, but one of two crews inadvertently left open a gas main 
leading into the furnace. 
</P>
<P>
	Human error -- beginning with inadequate training and culminating  
with maintenance crews' failure to communicate during the shutdown 
-- was the overriding cause, Ms. Wilbur said. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement, reached Monday night among representatives of  
Ford, the state and the United Auto Workers union, focuses on 
prevention as well as punishment, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This settlement agreement allows the company to focus its  
efforts on accident prevention,'' James Padilla, Ford group vice 
president for manufacturing, said in a statement. ``We cannot 
change the terrible events of the past, but we can work hard to 
make our workplaces safer in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the fine, the settlement calls for Ford to pay $5.5  
million for boiler safety, burn research and treatment, a 
scholarship fund for UAW members and their families, and state 
costs.

<HEADLINE> McCain Outlines Issues on N.H. tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW LONDON, N.H. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate John  
McCain said Thursday the government should consider creating a 
guest-worker program for would-be illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as Mexican, El Salvadoran and Guatemalan young men  
can't feed themselves and their families where they live, they're 
going to come to America,'' the Arizona senator said. ``And there 
are many jobs American citizens won't do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giving those jobs -- ranging from farm work to jobs in wealthy  
suburbs -- to foreigners would alleviate their desire to immigrate 
illegally, McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	During a wide-ranging speech before 200 people in New London's  
town hall, McCain also said the United States should be ready to 
use force to defend Taiwan's independence from China. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to directly threaten China,'' said McCain, who is  
touring the state by bus. But, ``I don't think the U.S. should sit 
by and watch that kind of aggression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he remained optimistic that the next generation of  
Chinese leaders will embrace democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	In the speech, McCain focused on issues that have won him the  
most support so far -- China policy, the military, and campaign 
finance. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also touched on other issues, such as how to provide  
prescription drugs to elderly patients who cannot afford them. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the government should encourage the use of medical  
savings accounts, provide tax breaks for the self-employed and work 
to lower exorbitant inflation in medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of those in attendance said McCain earned their respect  
with his willingness to contradict the GOP on several issues, such 
as his proposal to rid political campaigns of unregulated 
donations. He said special interests control both parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``No longer are you represented in Washington unless you can  
give huge amounts of soft money,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain was to continue the New Hampshire bus tour Friday in  
Concord.

<HEADLINE> Workplace Challenges Predicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pressure to correct lingering disparities in  
employment opportunities and pay between white and minority 
Americans will increase as the population grows and changes over 
the next 50 years, the Labor Department predicts. 
</P>
<P>
	By 2050, the U.S. population is expected to increase by 50  
percent with immigration accounting for almost two-thirds of that 
growth, the agency said in a new report on future workplace trends. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, about half of all Americans will belong to what are now  
considered minority groups, compared with slightly more than a 
quarter today. 
</P>
<P>
	``When one out of two workers will be a person of color, pay  
discrimination, lingering gaps in skills, opportunity and jobs 
matter to us all,'' said Labor Secretary Alexis Herman in remarks 
prepared for a pre-Labor Day speech she is to deliver today at a 
job training center in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department released the accompanying report on  
workplace trends on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Demographic and other workplace changes in the next century will  
challenge employers, employees and the government to live up to 
workplace standards established over the past 100 years, Herman 
said. ``As we look to the new century, we need to preserve what is 
best about who we are -- our values and traditions,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the agency's other predictions for the future:  
</P>
<P>
	--Worker education and training opportunities will be a bigger  
concern for individuals choosing between jobs, and when labor 
unions and management sit around the bargaining table. 
</P>
<P>
	Advances in technology and the globalization of industry will  
reduce the U.S. supply of low-skilled jobs. Many of the fastest 
growing jobs in the future will require a college diploma or other 
special training. Among them: computer engineers, database 
administrators, desktop publishers, medical assistants, and 
securities and financial sales people. 
</P>
<P>
	--The increasing desire by companies and workers for more  
flexible work arrangements will raise new questions about workers' 
rights and employers' responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, one in 10 workers are in an alternative work  
arrangement. Most, 8.5 million, are independent contractors and 1.3 
million others work through temporary help agencies. Only 7 percent 
of temp workers have health benefits and just one in 10 is eligible 
for a pension plan. 
</P>
<P>
	--Assistive technology including voice recognition software and  
alternative keyboards will make it easier for people with 
disabilities to join the work force, but they may still need to 
overcome societal barriers. Currently, three out of four 
working-age people with disabilities who want jobs don't have them.

<HEADLINE> Spanish Soap Opera Star Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Fernando Carrillo, a star of Spanish soap operas,  
says he's hoping to be quickly acquitted of misdemeanor drug 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think this will jeopardize my career, because I'm  
innocent,'' Carrillo said Thursday to crowd of largely 
Spanish-language press. ``We all make mistakes. This has been a 
hold on my career for two days. I want to get it over with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carrillo, 33, was arrested Tuesday on marijuana and drug  
paraphernalia possession charges. Police say they found bags of 
marijuana in the Jeep driven by Carrillo's brother after it was 
pulled over for allegedly speeding through a school zone. An 
officer searched the vehicle after smelling marijuana, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say a bag of marijuana was found where Carrillo had been  
sitting. Three additional bags were found under the seat, and a 
backpack containing a metal pipe with marijuana residue was also 
recovered, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Venezuelan actor said the incident has embarrassed him, but  
said he has received support from fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people don't want to believe what has happened,'' he said.  
``They've been giving me a lot of love in the street, which I never 
felt before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carrillo recently starred in the soap ``Rosalinda'' with Mexican  
actress and singer Thalia. He was arrested in Miami Beach, where he 
is to begin work on a new album, said Angela Rodriguez, his 
publicist.

<HEADLINE> Russian Envoy to IMF Abruptly Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A second Bank of New York employee has been  
dismissed amid a probe into whether the bank's accounts were used 
by Russian mobsters and others to launder billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Svetlana Kudryavtsev, an associate in the bank's Eastern  
European division, was fired for failing to cooperate with an 
internal investigation, a source familiar with the matter said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A bank spokesman would only confirm that Ms. Kudryavtsev had  
been fired, and did not provide a reason. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Friday, the bank fired Lucy Edwards, a London-based vice  
president, for gross misconduct, violation of the bank's internal 
policies, falsification of bank records and failure to cooperate 
with the bank's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Law enforcement authorities are looking into allegations that up  
to $10 billion was laundered through the bank's accounts by Russian 
organized crime and other figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank had earlier suspended Ms. Edwards along with another  
executive, Natasha Kagalovsky, who supervised the bank's business 
in Eastern Europe from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kagalovsky has denied any wrongdoing. So far no one has been  
charged with any crime in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank clearly is troubled that its name has been associated  
with the scandal. On Monday, bank chairman Thomas A. Renyi sent a 
memo to employees defending the institution's reputation and 
promising ``prompt action'' if any inappropriate action by bank 
staff was discovered.

<HEADLINE> Doctor Disciplined Over Lack of Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Oregon's medical board has disciplined a  
doctor for not doing enough to relieve six patients' pain, marking 
the first time a state board in the United States has taken such 
action for giving too little -- rather than too much -- medication. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Paul A. Bilder of Roseburg, who was disciplined Wednesday,  
was accused of using Tylenol to treat an elderly man who was in 
pain from terminal cancer, refusing morphine for an 82-year-old 
with congestive heart failure and declining to resume pain 
medication for a woman on a mechanical ventilator. 
</P>
<P>
	Documents also indicate the doctor has had communication lapses  
with patients and families, and an apparent lack of up-to-date 
knowledge about proper pain treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Bilder, who declined comment on his case, signed a statement  
acknowledging that his treatment showed unprofessional or 
dishonorable conduct and negligence. He must undergo a one-year 
program in which another doctor works with him to assess his 
practice, and he must complete a course on doctor-patient 
communication. 
</P>
<P>
	A few state medical boards have investigated complaints of  
doctors undertreating pain. No other state, however, has taken 
action against a doctor primarily for undertreating pain, according 
to the Federation of State Medical Boards. 
</P>
<P>
	The case reflects a national shift in policy regarding pain.  
Doctors who were once concerned about turning their patients into 
addicts are now heeding studies showing that most pain patients 
don't become addicted and many, particular those in their final 
years, are suffering too much. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still getting surveys that tell us that patients during  
their dying period are suffering undue pain. We want that to go to 
zero,'' said Dr. George Porter, chairman of the Oregon Board of 
Medical Examiners. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter acknowledged that 20 years ago, when Bilder was starting  
as a pulmonary disease specialist, he would not have been brought 
before the board. 
</P>
<P>
	But Porter described a new climate of compassion toward pain,  
particularly in Oregon, where voters twice approved the nation's 
only assisted suicide law and where a 1995 law shields doctors from 
discipline if they administer drugs to treat patients with 
intractable pain. 
</P>
<P>
	A study published last year in the Journal of the American  
Medical Association found that one in four elderly cancer patients 
in nursing homes received nothing for their daily pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Susan Tolle, director of the ethics center at Oregon Health  
Sciences University, praised the board for not throwing the book at 
Bilder and instead creating a plan for him to learn. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of things we aren't taught in medical school,''  
she said. ``Medicine keeps changing.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Lower; Dow Down 94.67 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks resumed their end-of-summer slump  
Thursday as concerns about inflation and interest rates were 
compounded by a dismal earnings outlook from Sears, Roebuck and Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 94.67 to close at  
10,843.21, having worked its way back from a loss of 205 points 
earlier in the session. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also closed lower. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 fell 11.96 to 1,319.11, and the Nasdaq composite index 
fell 16.56 to 2,734.24. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks tumbled as a slew of bad news hit Wall Street a day  
before the scheduled release of the government's August employment 
report. Above all, investors were rattled by continuing fears that 
the Federal Reserve has not yet completed its efforts to ward off 
inflation by imposing higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Those fears escalated Thursday as Federal Reserve Gov. Edward  
Kelley told Market News International it would be premature to 
assume the Fed will wait until next year to raise rates again. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed raised rates June 30 and Aug. 24, providing a temporary  
lift to the market both times as hopes grew that the central bank 
would make no further moves. But sporadic hints of inflationary 
pressures have kept the Fed on alert and investors on edge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three bumps in rates might be as much as the market can  
take,'' said Bob Dickey, managing director of technical analysis at 
Dain Rauscher in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	A Labor Department report offered potential justification for  
higher rates. The government said the growth of American workers' 
productivity slowed considerably in the spring, while labor costs 
jumped sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	That bad news sent the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond  
climbing to 6.13 percent from 6.08 percent late Wednesday. Bonds 
are especially sensitive to inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rising long-bond yield is deadly for stocks,'' said Larry  
Wachtel, market analyst with Prudential Securities. High yields can 
lure investors away from stocks as they seek out stable, guaranteed 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was also on guard in advance of the employment  
report, due out before the start of trading Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who's going to take a stand today when they know they could  
get clobbered tomorrow if that number is bad?'' Wachtel said.

	Sears weighed heavily on the Dow, falling 3 11/16 to 33 1/2 after  
saying its third-quarter net income will come in at 63 cents to 67 
cents a share, well below analysts' forecast of 82 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Other major retailers also fell as the warning from Sears  
sparked fears that other retailers will begin to falter. Best Buy 
plunged 10 1/2 to 61 7/16 after reporting that sales from stores open 
at least a year -- a widely followed gauge of retail strength -- rose 
11.1 percent in the latest quarter. The increase met analysts' 
expectations, but was not as steep as gains from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickey said the selloff in retail stocks was overblown, and  
motivated at least partially by the belief that higher interest 
rates will eventually keep Americans out of the stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``The retailers provided great news today, but people were  
looking for excuses to sell,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's financial services companies also fell. J.P. Morgan  
fell 3 11/16 to 125 15/16 and American Express lost 3 1/8 to 135 7/8. 
Banks and brokerages are often the first companies to feel the 
pinch of higher interest rates, because lending volume generally 
shrinks as it becomes more expensive to borrow money. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 12-to-5 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange. Composite volume totaled 813.09 
million shares, compared with 853.19 million in the previous 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 3.57 to 427.42.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.96 percent.  
European indexes tumbled along with U.S. stocks. Germany's DAX 
index lost 2.4 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 1.3 percent, and 
France's CAC-40 was fell 1.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Willie Stargell Hospitalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Hall of Famer Willie Stargell is undergoing  
treatment for an undisclosed serious health problem with one of his 
organs. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh Pirates officials have refused comment about  
Stargell, one their greatest players ever and an assistant to 
general manager Cam Bonifay. 
</P>
<P>
	But former teammates and friends have become increasingly  
concerned about the 58-year-old Stargell, who has had health 
problems for about 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Stargell was admitted to a Pittsburgh hospital under an assumed  
name for tests about three weeks ago, according to three sources 
close to the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
	During his hospital stay, the former Pirates star underwent  
blood tests and dialysis, a source said, speaking on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources did not disclose Stargell's specific ailment. But a  
former teammate, who did not want to be identified, said Stargell 
has undergone kidney dialysis for several years. 
</P>
<P>
	Stargell was moved recently from the Pittsburgh hospital to  
another medical care facility to undergo additional treatment and 
care, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately known if Stargell was still in the  
Pittsburgh area or had been moved to a facility near his home in 
Wilmington, N.C., where he lives with his wife, Margaret. 
</P>
<P>
	Pirates managing general partner Kevin McClatchy, who hired  
Stargell in 1997, has ordered team officials not to comment about 
Stargell. 
</P>
<P>
	Stargell has not been seen in the owner's box at Three Rivers  
Stadium, where he often watched games, for about a month. But such 
absences were not uncommon as Stargell often left town to watch 
minor league games, attend baseball card shows to sign autographs 
or to return to his home. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the sources said Stargell first began having health  
problems after his weight increased significantly following his 
retirement in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after rejoining former Pirates manager Chuck Tanner's  
coaching staff in Atlanta in 1986, he sought medical treatment for 
a heart condition -- apparently, an irregular heartbeat -- and was 
ordered to lose weight, one of the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stargell later dropped a considerable amount of weight, and  
looked to be at nearly his playing weight when he returned to the 
Pirates in February 1997 at McClatchy's request. 
</P>
<P>
	But Stargell put on weight after rejoining the Pirates, and team  
officials have known for months he had health problems. Unable to 
stand for long stretches, he usually sat on the dugout bench to 
watch batting practice, often shooing away anyone who blocked his 
view. 
</P>
<P>
	While in the dugout, Stargell sought out former teammates and  
friends for conversation and willingly gave interviews, even though 
his speech had slowed noticeably in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates have tried to deflect questions about Stargell's  
health, but team officials have received calls recently from former 
teammates and friends inquiring about his condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is one of the greatest team leaders ever in sports,''  
Tanner said recently when interviewed about the 1979 World Series 
champion Pirates. ``He lifted that team up and carried it to the 
World Series. Any time you needed a big hit that season, Willie 
gave it to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stargell hit 32 homers in 1979, several years after it was  
generally believed his career was winding down. He also hit 48 
homers for the 1971 World Series champion Pirates -- the most by any 
Pirates player in the last 49 years -- but was overshadowed in the 
World Series by Hall of Fame teammate Roberto Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
	Stargell played for the Pirates from 1962-82, batting .282 with  
475 homers -- he had seven more in the postseason -- and 1,540 RBIs. 
He is the Pirates' career leader in home runs, RBIs and extra-base 
hits (953). 
</P>
<P>
	Known as ``Pops'' while leading the 1979 ``We Are Family''  
Pirates, he shared the National League MVP award that year with 
Keith Hernandez of St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Stargell also was the MVP of the NL playoffs and World Series  
and is the only player to win all three awards in the same season. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, Stargell became the 200th member of the Hall of Fame  
and the 17th elected in his first year of induction. He later 
became the Braves' special assistant to the director of player 
personnel, a title he held until returning to Pittsburgh.

<HEADLINE> Buffalo's Smith To Miss Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- Bruce Smith will miss Buffalo's final  
exhibition game to be with his sick father, the veteran defensive 
end said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith has decided not to play Saturday against Pittsburgh, and  
instead will spend the weekend with his father, George, in the 
family's hometown of Norfolk, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	``My father is a very sick man,'' Smith said. ``His condition is  
very serious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith plans to return next week to prepare for the regular  
season opener at Indianapolis on Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be back in time to start preparing for the Colts,'' Smith  
said. ``But the most important thing is me having piece of mind 
where my father is concerned. God forbid something were to happen 
and I didn't take his illness seriously enough and never saw him 
again. I just can't take that chance, no matter what the cost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's 79-year-old father has been plagued for years by  
emphysema and heart problems, among other ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a combination of a lot of things,'' said Smith, who added  
that his father cannot speak much or take more than a few steps 
without becoming exhausted. ``Emphysema for the most part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 36-year-old Smith has battled injury and struggled through  
contract hassles in his career. ``I see now where I get the will to 
continue striving through all kinds of adversity,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith is one of the most dominant defensive players in the  
history of the game and has been selected to the Pro Bowl 11 times. 
He trails only Reggie White in career sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Marcellus Wiley will start in Smith's place.  
</P>
<P>
	The Bills also will sit offensive lineman Joe Panos on Saturday.  
Panos was examined Thursday following a series of neck stingers. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently demoted center Dusty Zeigler will take over for Panos  
at right guard.

<HEADLINE> Layoffs At Texas Sunglasses Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Luxottica Group SpA, an Italian company that  
makes Ray-Ban sunglasses, reportedly has informed hundreds of 
workers at a manufacturing plant here they were being laid off 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	The company declined to confirm or deny a report Friday in the  
San Antonio Express-News. 
</P>
<P>
	Luxottica is ``in the process of evaluating day-to-day business  
operations at the Ray-Ban Sun-Optics plant,'' said Peter DeMarco, 
managing director of Ray-Ban's Southwest operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be inappropriate for me to communicate anything that  
has not been communicated to employees. It would be appropriate to 
wait until all decisions have been made,'' DeMarco said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the company's 600 workers told the newspaper they  
learned Thursday morning that their jobs would end at the close of 
their shift. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said it didn't make sense (to keep the plant open)  
because of the drop in sales,'' said Geneva Serna of San Antonio, a 
10-year veteran of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers said there were rumors their jobs were in jeopardy  
before Thursday, when they management informed them of the layoffs 
in small groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The sunglasses plant in southwest San Antonio changed hands in  
late June when Luxottica bought Ray-Ban and its manufacturing 
plants for $640 million from Bausch &AMP; Lomb Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers told the newspaper they were told to return to work at  
7:30 a.m. Friday to collect their severance packages.

<HEADLINE> Radiation Panel Makeup Protested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The threat of cancer from large amounts of  
nuclear radiation is clear. But will small doses over many years 
put people at risk? 
</P>
<P>
	A panel of scientists formed to answer the question has become  
entangled in controversy even before its work begins, with critics 
charging too many of the scientists are tied to the nuclear 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``A campaign is under way to further relax already weak  
radiation protection standards,'' more than 130 environmental, 
health and anti-nuclear activists wrote the National Academy of 
Sciences this week, protesting the composition of the review 
committee, which was holding its first meeting today. 
</P>
<P>
	The academy's National Research Council, which selected the  
scientists for the three-year study, added five member. One 
scientist was forced to withdraw because of the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	Evan Douple, director of the council's radiation studies branch,  
called the composition of the panel ``balanced'' and said in a 
recent interview that the scientists have the expertise to examine 
the issue ``from a scientific point of view without politics and 
without bias.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some scientists who have been involved in low-dose radiation  
studies say the panel still is heavily skewed to the view that 
current assumptions about low-dose radiation overstate the health 
risks. Some of the members have asserted no radiation harm can be 
found below a certain threshold, contrary to existing dogma. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very lopsided committee with predictable outcome,''  
said Rudi Nussbaum, professor emeritus of physics and environmental 
sciences at Portland State University. 
</P>
<P>
	Nussbaum was one of eight scientists who complained in a letter  
to the Academy that the panel ``is dominated by individuals whose 
work has been conducted within institutional settings heavily 
influenced by organizations with interests in the nuclear 
industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the scientists said, the panel ``does not  
include a significant number of persons who have demonstrated 
independence from this institutional setting'' including a number 
of scientists whose studies have suggested elevated cancer levels 
from low-dose radiation exposure. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides agree much is at stake in the three-year study.  
</P>
<P>
	Formally known as the Committee on Biological Effects of  
Ionizing Radiation, or BEIR, the panel's findings are likely to 
have tremendous impact on radiation levels the government will 
allowed at abandoned nuclear power plants, in the cleanup of 
nuclear weapons production facilities and at nuclear waste disposal 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The nuclear industry has long argued that the adverse health  
effects from low-dose radiation have not been scientifically shown 
and that current maximum radiation exposure levels may be higher 
than what is needed to protect public health. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., asked for the General  
Accounting Office in Congress to review whether radiation standards 
could be eased. ``If radiation protection standards are 
unnecessarily restrictive, the impact on the cost of (nuclear) 
waste disposals, power plant decommissioning and decontamination 
and environmental cleanup could be huge,'' said Dominici. 
</P>
<P>
	Current risk assessments on low-dose radiation are made by  
extrapolating from the increased cancers observed from exposure to 
high doses, principally among victims of the World War II atomic 
bomb blasts in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	This approach adopted by past BEIR committees assumes that risks  
from low doses follow a ``linear'' model with the risks declining 
as dose levels decline, but that each unit of radiation, no matter 
how small, still is assumed to cause cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	But some scientists, including many of the new BEIR review  
panel, contend the linear theory overstates the cancer risks and 
that, as a result, the radiation exposure levels may, in fact, be 
too stringent. A number of the panel members have testified for 
industry in radiation exposure cases or challenged studies 
suggesting elevated cancers from low-dose radiation exposure, the 
critics said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The BEIR committee has been loaded up with people from this  
side of the debate,'' complained Daniel Hirsch, executive director 
of Committee to Bridge the Gap, a California-based anti-nuclear 
watchdog group. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kenneth Mossman, a professor of health physics at Arizona  
State University who was dropped from the panel after becoming a 
prime target of the critics' attacks, said panel members represent 
a variety of opinions and a ``centrist'' view of the issue.

<HEADLINE> Teens Plead Innocent in Hacking Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Four teen-agers charged with hacking into the  
computer systems of the Pentagon and NASA pleaded innocent 
Thursday, the lawyer for the alleged ringleader said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shmuel Tzang said his client, Ehud Tenenbaum, 19, broke no law  
when he penetrated the Internet sites of American and Israeli 
institutions and the Israeli parliament because there was no notice 
on the sites declaring them off-limits. 
</P>
<P>
	An Israeli magistrate ordered charges that the teens broke into  
computer systems of extremist groups in the United States to be 
dropped and asked the two sides to reduce the witness list by 
having some people submit affidavits instead of testifying, Tzang 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The original witness list includes 10 U.S. witnesses, mostly FBI  
agents, who would be flown in from the United States at Israel's 
expense. 
</P>
<P>
	Tenenbaum did not address the court as his lawyer entered the  
plea. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides will return to court Oct. 10 to tell the judge if  
they were able to reduce the number of witnesses. A trial date has 
not yet been set. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants face a maximum sentence of three years in prison  
if convicted. None are in custody. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have said that Tenenbaum, who used the name ``The  
Analyzer'' on the Internet, was the group leader and tutored the 
others in the unauthorized penetration of computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The other defendants are Guy Fleisher, Ariel Rosenfeld and  
Rafael Ohana. Their ages were not given, but the indictment said 
they were all born in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Another defendant, Barak Abutbul, has confessed to helping  
Tenenbaum break into the computer systems and has agreed to testify 
against him in exchange for a lighter sentence.

<HEADLINE> Radio Revolution in Digital Sound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A stereo that reveals the title and artist on  
a digital screen as the song plays. Deejays promoting products on 
air -- then sending electronic coupons for the items to listeners 
over personal computing devices. A car radio that can display 
real-time traffic reports and stock quotes as they are streamed 
over the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
	After decades of minimal fine-tuning, the world of radio is  
finally headed for a makeover. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies behind the digital radio revolution say they are on  
the way to making a long sought vision a reality: CD-quality sound 
for FM listeners, less interference for AM listeners and prospects 
for a whole host of new data services. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here is an industry that has not seen any technological change  
since the 1940s, when FM was introduced,'' said Suren Pai, 
president of Lucent Digital Radio, one of several companies vying 
to develop technology that would allow for a seamless transition 
between the current analog service and the new digital system. 
``Consumers were looking for innovation in the radio space.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Using the language of computers -- 0s and 1s -- to transmit  
information, the digital signal is less susceptible to interference 
and more efficient. Radio airwaves have enough bandwidth to carry 
large volumes of digital data -- more than existing wireless 
technology. That opens the door for a new breed of radios that can 
give listeners much more than sound. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal is for broadcasters to transmit digitally encoded music  
or data at the same time as they send out regular AM or FM service. 
That means traditional radios would continue to work, even as 
listeners started to replace them with digital models. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first order of business is to do no harm to analog  
radio,'' said Robert Struble, president of USA Digital Radio, which 
has the backing of some of the nation's top radio groups in its bid 
to create the standard for digital radio technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is running trials of digital radio in a number of  
markets -- even driving buses under bridges and in wooded areas to 
make sure the signal can be picked up in hard-to-reach places. 
</P>
<P>
	But the industry expects it will be another 12 to 18 months  
before consumers can sample the high-quality sound. 
</P>
<P>
	First, regulators must adopt a technical standard for digital  
radio. On Thursday, Bill Kennard, chairman of the Federal 
Communications Commission, reaffirmed his commitment to seeing 
radio join other technologies that have gone digital. He pledged to 
launch a formal proceeding on the matter by fall. Regulators at 
some point might have to address issues raised by digital radio 
applications, like commercial licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers also must roll out new radios that can receive the  
signal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's an inevitability that radio goes digital,'' said  
Gordon Hodge, a radio industry analyst with Thomas Weisel Partners 
in San Francisco. ``Really what it boils down to is cost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts expect that digital radios will be cheap enough to  
entice consumers to switch. Some industry estimates put the cost of 
new receivers at 15 percent to 30 percent more than current 
high-quality radios. 
</P>
<P>
	Because their old radios won't be obsolete yet, ``it could take  
some time for people to say, 'This is how I want to listen to my 
music,''' says Mark O'Brien, vice president of BIA Consulting, a 
radio and television advisory company in Chantilly, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	It could be several more years before consumers can get some of  
the advanced data applications that digital radio signals make 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
	A specially equipped clock radio could receive continual weather  
reports over the digital signal from a broadcasting service, even 
while it remains in sleep mode. Then, if an emergency arose, 
instructions sent over the air could turn the radio on and display 
the relevant information on a nearby screen. 
</P>
<P>
	Home entertainment systems also lend themselves to the  
technology: a television screen could be used to tell consumers how 
to order the latest Mariah Carey album as her tune plays on the 
stereo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ultimate capabilities will depend on the creativity of the  
software providers or broadcasters,'' said Bob Law, vice president 
of Kenwood USA, which expects to manufacture digital car radios by 
spring of 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Digital airwave signals don't have to be directed at a  
conventional radio either. Handheld computing devices or even 
cellular phones could be equipped to receive the data carried by 
the signals. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> When Hot Toys Get Cold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Every few years, there seems to be a must-have toy across the  
nation. But what happens to these toys once the next big thing 
catches on? 
</P>
<P>
	Some popular toys and where they are now.  

</P>
<P>
                          *Holiday Barbie    	
</P>
<P>
	Launched by Mattel in 1988, Holiday Barbie was among the  
nation's best-selling dolls in 1995 and '96. But sales soon fell, 
and the doll was discontinued this year. 

</P>
<P>
                         *Cabbage Patch Kids    	
</P>
<P>
	Sales of the pudgy dolls went as high as $4 billion for Coleco  
in the 1980s. The dolls, now made by Mattel, remain somewhat 
popular, and some original handmade versions command thousands of 
dollars from collectors. 

</P>
<P>
                           *Teddy Ruxpin    	
</P>
<P>
	Worlds of Wonder began selling the talking bears in 1985, and  
more than 7 million were sold within a few years. But many were 
returned because of malfunctions, and Worlds of Wonder filed for 
bankruptcy. Teddy Ruxpin was brought back in 1998 by Yes! 
Entertainment, which this year filed for bankruptcy court 
protection. 

</P>
<P>
                             *Hula Hoop    	
</P>
<P>
	Wham-O introduced the Hula Hoop in 1958, and 25 million were  
sold in just a few months. After two years, the number surpassed 
100 million. Sales slowed by the early '60s, but the plastic, 
circular rings are still found in most large toy stores.

<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- First-base umpire Marty Foster, who became a  
permanent member of the American League staff earlier in the day, 
ejected Tampa Bay manager Larry Rothschild in the sixth inning of 
Thursday night's game against Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Rothschild protested Foster's safe call on Derrick May's  
grounder. Tampa Bay shortstop Aaron Ledesma fielded May's grounder 
and forced Albert Belle at second, but Foster ruled May beat second 
baseman Miguel Cairo's relay to avert an inning-ending double play.

<P>
	Rothschild jogged to debate Foster's call behind first base.  
After a short, civil discussion, their argument became briefly 
animated before Foster ejected Rothschild. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the third ejection this season for Rothschild. Foster,  
39, had been a Triple-A umpire before Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Bowden vs. Holtz a New S.C. Rivalry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Bowden vs. Holtz.  
</P>
<P>
	It sounds like a video game football fantasy, but it's real,  
from recruits' living rooms to ``Live with Regis and Kathie Lee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemson's Tommy Bowden and South Carolina's Lou Holtz have begun  
a rivalry that could last decades -- and they don't even play for 
almost three months. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a lot of patience here,'' Bowden said.  
</P>
<P>
	Clemson opens at home Saturday against Marshall, and South  
Carolina travels to No. 24 North Carolina State. Holtz vs. Bowden, 
however, has been imprinted on fans' minds since they both arrived 
in December to rescue programs in distress. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost immediately after they arrived:  
</P>
<P>
	--Bowden snagged Holtz's predecessor Brad Scott to help with area  
recruits. Holtz snagged South Carolina's ``Mr. Football,'' runner 
Derek Watson. 
</P>
<P>
	--Holtz created a statewide stir with an antilitter campaign.  
Bowden was soon signed up for public service ads for the same 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Columbia post office announced a special envelope  
commemorating Holtz's debut; the Clemson post office rushed the 
same for Bowden. 
</P>
<P>
	--Talk show host Regis Philbin talked up his friend Holtz on the  
air this spring. Then Bowden's wife, Linda, wrote Philbin to remind 
him there was another rising star in the state. ``She's a true 
Clemson gal now,'' Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemson-South Carolina is one of the South's more savage, if not  
celebrated, matchups. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers tout their 1981 national championship and Atlantic  
Coast Conference success with then-coach Danny Ford. South Carolina 
backers counter with their loyal support, selling out 
Williams-Brice Stadium four straight years despite just one bowl 
victory in 106 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after Bowden's introduction at Clemson, South Carolina  
piped in with Holtz, who has since used his megawatt charm to 
promote the university and readjust its losing attitude about 
football. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither is playing it up, however.  
</P>
<P>
	Holtz said when he was hired that Clemson ``obviously got a far  
better-looking, younger and more intelligent guy than me.'' Bowden, 
45, remembers Holtz and his wife staying with his parents as a 
child. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really know him by hearing my father talk,'' the Clemson  
coach said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden keeps an eye on South Carolina, but a bigger one on his  
Atlantic Coast Conference foes. Holtz recognizes Clemson's 
importance, but says the Gamecocks have a tough enough task in the 
Southeastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	He laughs at fans who say all they care about is beating the  
Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You try going one and 10 and beating Clemson eight years in a  
row. You won't be coaching here,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz wants support from everyone, including Clemson fans, and  
is teaching the Gamecocks to love thy rival. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're a South Carolina fan, you ought to pull for Clemson  
10 times a year,'' Holtz said. ``People say they go to the circus 
and boo the tiger. That's the wrong approach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It may be too soon for a Gamecock-Tiger detente.  
</P>
<P>
	Holtz's ultimate boss, South Carolina president John Palms,  
joked at a recent lunch that when Bowden arrives at heaven's pearly 
gates there will be a nice house flying Tiger flags, but way above 
will be God's home -- with Gamecock flags. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet is filled with South Carolina fans griping at  
Clemson ``Taterheads.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's Tigers fan Steve Bowie, who goes on for screens and  
screens at his Web site about why Clemson outshines South Carolina. 
He concludes with, ``We get Tommy Bowden ... the Cocks get Loose 
Bolts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holtz says he'll build a winner with the Gamecocks. If his son  
and offensive coordinator, 34-year-old Skip, succeeds him, as many 
fans think, the Holtz name could be at South Carolina for a long, 
long time. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden says he'd like to stay around by bringing Clemson back on  
top. He's talked with several ex-Clemson coaches and had lunch at 
Ford's nearby farm, finding out how to stay No. 1 in Tigertown. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden's father, Bobby, who has to face cross-state rivals Miami  
and Florida State almost every year, knows the importance of 
locking up one's territory. But to face Holtz with all South 
Carolina watching could be more than the elder Bowden wants to 
ponder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank goodness he's Tommy's problem now,'' Bobby Bowden wrote  
in The (Columbia) State, ``and not mine.''

<HEADLINE> Driver Wants To Apologize to Author </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRYEBURG, Maine (AP) -- The driver whose van injured Stephen King  
as he was walking alongside a road said he would like to apologize 
to the author face-to-face. 
</P>
<P>
	The horror writer is recuperating after six operations to repair  
broken bones and a collapsed lung from the June 19 accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got distracted,'' Bryan Smith said in Wednesday's Bangor  
Daily News. ``It was one time, and one time only. I'm very, very 
sorry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he suffers from depression over the accident. He said  
he went off the road while trying to control his dog. A grand jury 
convenes Sept. 30 to decide whether charges should be filed against 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	King said he has no intention of suing Smith but wants his  
driver's license revoked. Smith's driving record includes four 
speeding violations, operating under the influence and driving to 
endanger. But he insisted he's not dangerous, as King has claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe 15 years ago he could say that. Fifteen? Twenty? Yes. I  
was dangerous,'' Smith said.

<HEADLINE> 737 Dogged by Safety Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- At any moment, there are roughly 800 Boeing  
737s flying somewhere in the world, making it the most common 
airliner in the sky. But there are lingering safety questions, and 
the crash of a 737 Tuesday in Argentina has put the airplane back 
in the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report released in July, the National Transportation Safety  
Board said there continue to be problems with the 737's rudder 
system, despite design changes prompted by fatal accidents and 
near-misses. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the safety board said the Federal Aviation  
Administration was concerned about the 737's rudder when it first 
certified the plane in the mid-1960s and again in 1997, shortly 
before it certified the latest series of the airplane, the 
so-called Next Generation 737. 
</P>
<P>
	In each case, Boeing was able to overcome those concerns by  
arguing that the rudder -- a panel on the tail that controls the 
plane in the case of a crosswind or a lost engine -- was safe and 
reliable. The board, the lead investigator in transportation 
accidents, challenges that contention. 
</P>
<P>
	``The safety board is concerned that the new features (of the  
redesigned rudder system) do not address all of these 
malfunctions,'' the five members wrote in the report, their final 
word on the 1994 crash of a USAir 737 outside Pittsburgh. All 132 
aboard were killed when the plane suddenly spiraled into a ravine 
shortly before landing. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said the LAPA airlines 737 that crashed Tuesday in  
Buenos Aires, Argentina, had lifted just a few feet off the runway 
when it skimmed across a road and crashed beside a golf course. 
Authorities said at least 64 people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	A sudden loss of thrust would tend to point to an engine problem  
-- not one with the rudder -- but it will be months before 
investigators determine a cause. The NTSB, the FAA and Boeing have 
sent investigators to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	The same parties are continuing to examine the April crash of a  
Turkish Airlines 737 in southeastern Turkey. That plane crashed 
eight minutes after takeoff after becoming engulfed in flames 
during a thunderstorm. The plane carried no passengers, but all six 
crew members were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing continues to insist that the 737 is a safe airplane.  
There are 3,100 in use worldwide and the airplane has made nearly 
80 million departures since being introduced. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one of the safest airplanes flying,'' Allen Berry, a  
Boeing engineer, told the St. Petersburg Times, which reported 
recently about the NTSB report. ``We feel strongly we have made 
improvements to make it even safer.''

<HEADLINE> Seles Seeks Tougher Self </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There was a moment in her U.S. Open victory over  
Silvia Farina when Monica Seles was on cruise control. Then she 
suddenly shifted into park. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading 6-2, 5-1 in Thursday's second-round match, Seles seemed  
to stop. Against Farina, that could be dangerous because the last 
time they met, in the Fed Cup in July, the Italian won 6-4, 4-6, 
6-4. 
</P>
<P>
	``Definitely, I didn't want to have a repeat,'' she said. ``My  
mind left me at 5-1. I thought, `This is going to be it, I'm 
serving with the wind. This is going to be too easy.''' 
</P>
<P>
	And suddenly, it wasn't so easy.  
</P>
<P>
	Quickly, Farina won two games before Seles pulled herself back  
and finished off the match, 6-2, 6-3. Afterward, she was a bit 
upset with the slip in concentration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just happy that I toughened it out there in that 5-3  
game,'' Seles said. ``It was very good this happened in an early 
round while I can still pull out a match. As the rounds go along, 
these things can't happen. So it's good it happened today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seeded No. 4, Seles sees herself as something of an outsider at  
the Open, where the spotlight is on No. 1 Martina Hingis, defending 
champion Lindsay Davenport and the Williams sisters, Venus and 
Serena. 
</P>
<P>
	Seles has nine Grand Slam championships in her resume, but she  
has won just one of them since the stabbing incident in 1993 that 
took her off the tour for 27 months. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think definitely there's a lot of focus on Martina, Lindsay,  
Venus and Serena,'' she said. ``They totally deserve it. They 
played better tennis this summer than I have. 
</P>
<P>
	``So definitely, they're more favorites than I am. It doesn't  
matter. I don't care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Seles had her way, she'd never play any matches. Instead,  
she'd be out there hitting every day, practicing her tennis, but 
not looking to tear somebody's head off on the other side of the 
net. 
</P>
<P>
	``I truly love to hit,'' she said. ``I just loved to practice  
and drill and that stuff. I really never enjoyed playing matches, 
even as a youngster. I just hate the whole thought that one 
(player) is better than the other. It drives me nuts. I just never 
liked it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That could be a dangerous mindset for a world class athlete, but  
Seles has managed to overcome those feelings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's survival out there,'' she said. ``If I don't, then the  
other person will. So you go into that automatic mode that you have 
no choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seles finally seems at ease with herself, at peace after the  
death of her father a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I truly miss him at the tennis court and at my practices,''  
she said. ``It's really hard. It's been hard to find direction, 
where my tennis game should be leading, where my dad would lead 
me'' 
</P>
<P>
	She is on her own, and there are times when she thinks it would  
help to develop a little bit of a mean streak, at least on the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been working on that,'' she said. ``But it's a hard one.  
I just want to be able to say `No' to more people and `I don't like 
this.' It's just part of growing up, I think, and not be such a 
pleaser.''

<HEADLINE> British Telecom, AT&AMP;T Complete Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- British Telecommunications PLC and AT&AMP;T Corp. have  
completed the purchase of a $1.9 billion stake in Japan Telecom 
Co., marking a further step in the consolidation of the global 
telephone industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which should strengthen the Japanese company's  
offering of phone and Internet services, was completed two months 
ahead of schedule, the companies said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the partnership arrangement, first announced in April, the  
British and U.S. companies together will own 30 percent of Japan 
Telecom, the third-largest long-distance phone company in Japan. BT 
and AT&AMP;T will each have 15 percent voting rights in the Japanese 
firm, said Phil Coathup, an AT&AMP;T spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The joint purchase is the first by BT and AT&AMP;T since the two  
companies announced plans last summer to form a $11 billion venture 
for selling services to multinational firms. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an important milestone. ... It positions us for strong  
growth in the data, mobile and Internet sectors in Japan,'' BT 
chief executive Sir Peter Bonfield said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	BT is Britain's biggest phone company, and AT&AMP;T is the largest  
long-distance and international carrier in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal comes in the wake of several other mergers and  
consolidations in the world's phone and Internet industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom, Germany's biggest telecommunications company,  
announced plans last month to pay $11.1 billion for the British 
mobile phone company One2One. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's Cable &AMP; Wireless Communications PLC agreed in July to  
sell its residential cable operations to rival NTL Inc. for about 
$10 billion. France Telecom expects to invest $5.5 billion in NTL 
to expand its foothold in Britain's cable market. 
</P>
<P>
	And in the United States, U S West Inc. is merging with Qwest  
Communications International Inc. in what could become a major 
rival to AT&AMP;T.

<HEADLINE> Kiwi Trustee Seeks Liquidation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- The turbulent life of Kiwi International Air  
Lines moved a step closer to ending as its bankruptcy trustee 
Thursday requested court permission to liquidate the few remaining 
assets of the grounded carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless a buyer surfaces in the next few weeks, trustee Charles  
A. Stanziale Jr. said he expects the liquidation would be approved 
later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts over the past several months to find a buyer proved  
fruitless. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've talked to dozens of people who expressed interest,  
initial interest, and who for various reasons decided this wasn't 
for them. I reached out every place I could,'' Stanziale said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiwi, now in its second bankruptcy, struggled since its founding  
in 1992 by airline employees who had lost their jobs at other 
carriers, mostly Pan Am and Eastern. The founders chose the name of 
a flightless bird for their employee-owned enterprise to symbolize 
the loss of their wings at their old airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	At its peak in the mid-'90s, the Newark-based airline had 1,200  
employees, 15 leased jets and flew 65 flights a day. Its 
destinations, at various times, included Atlanta, Bermuda, Boston, 
Chicago, Las Vegas, Puerto Rico, and Miami, Orlando, Tampa and Palm 
Beach in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kiwi was beset by debt and was shut down three times by  
regulators, although pilots proudly touted a safety record that 
``never scratched a wing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It emerged two years ago from its first bankruptcy when  
Baltimore surgeon Charles C. Edwards bought the airline and took 
majority ownership of the company from the employees. A message 
left Thursday for Edwards, who oversaw the airline until Stanziale 
was named trustee, was not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiwi suffered from the beginning because it did not have enough  
money to weather the hardball tactics of giant carriers such as 
Continental Airlines, which has a major hub at Newark International 
Airport, said Tom Parsons, editor and publisher of Bestfares.com, a 
travel magazine and Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	While Kiwi got good ratings for service and food, it was forced  
to add and drop cities when bigger airlines dropped prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``We never knew one week to the next where they were flying,''  
Parsons said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kiwi name now has no market value, and better-funded  
discount startups in the region made it an unlikely purchase, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiwi entered what now appears to be its death spiral in March,  
when the Federal Aviation Administration grounded it, saying it was 
unable to fly safely. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiwi declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy, hoping to reorganize, and  
laid off nearly all of its 500 workers and surrendered its four 
leased jets as it looked for a rescuer. Pan Am Airways had offered 
to buy Kiwi in March for $3 million, but that plan collapsed when 
Kiwi could not immediately regain its flight certificate. 
</P>
<P>
	Papers filed Thursday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court here seek to  
convert the bankruptcy to Chapter 7, liquidation, claiming more 
than $20 million in debts. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanziale said Kiwi's biggest and first creditor, the Internal  
Revenue Service, is owed about $12 million, but will only get about 
$1 million from the collection of some $1 million owed to Kiwi.

<HEADLINE>  Wildfire Threatens California Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAWNSKIN, Calif. (AP) -- More than a century has passed since  
this tiny mountain community stopped mining for gold and started 
mining tourist dollars. Now locals fear a wildfire could reduce it 
to cinders. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just waiting for three blasts from the fire department  
siren. That's the signal to run,'' said Paul Wentz, 78, who lives 
in the log cabin that was originally built in 1890 to serve as the 
Fawnskin post office. 
</P>
<P>
	Flashing a jack-o'-lantern grin, Wentz said he expects he and  
his cabin will remain standing for some time to come. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I made a list of things I need just in case,'' he said  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than two miles away, the 60,100-acre Willow fire inched  
closer to the San Bernardino Mountain town as erratic winds carried 
it from tree to tree over steep cliffs peppered with granite 
boulders. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters ordered selected forests torched in an attempt to  
create buffer zones for homes threatened by the largest of the 
West's wildfires. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to try to beat it at its own game,'' said Kathy  
Saindon, spokeswoman for the San Bernardino County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Kristel Johnson said the  
controlled fires were succees. Firefighters also were helped by 
light winds, higher humidity and lower temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
	The Willow fire, which has been burning since Saturday from the  
Mojave Desert into the mountains 90 miles east of Los Angeles, is 
one of a half-dozen major fires in California. 
</P>
<P>
	Another six wildfires were burning in Montana, Utah and Idaho,  
where a 35,118-acre grass blaze was contained Wednesday night 
several miles from the Snake River community of Glenns Ferry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Willow blaze, started by an illegal campfire, was 35 percent  
contained today. Twelve desert homes in Apple Valley were destroyed 
during the initial stages of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	In Fawnskin, where 380 people live year-round, resident Ron  
Shanahan, 44, stood outside the Gold Pan restaurant watching smoke 
rise dramatically over a ridge two miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it could take out half of this town,'' he said,  
gesturing to the small wooden shops and cabins lining the edge of 
Big Bear Lake. ``We're not sure whether we should start packing 
yet. I mean, how can you even start to pack up 30 years of your 
life?'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, giant pine trees exploded in flames a few miles  
from Green Valley Lake, a resort hamlet at the 8,000-foot level not 
far from Lake Arrowhead and Big Bear. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the residents scrambled to pack their belongings or  
volunteered to help fight the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst part is that everybody is so tired,'' said fire  
Capt. Rick Mull, rubbing bloodshot eyes. ``But everyone in the town 
is coming together to help us and help each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bed-and-breakfast, camping and boating resort has about 350  
full-time residents and many were staying despite a voluntary 
evacuation alert. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than running, talk among locals centered on the fire's  
impact on tourism over the Labor Day weekend. The final weekend of 
summer usually brings 500 people to Green Valley Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if the fire is going to get up here, but I'm  
getting calls from people who want to cancel their vacation,'' said 
Ted Fogel, who works at a cabin rental firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Down in Lucerne Valley, fire blackened Barbara Jo Jones' 35  
acres of remote desert land at the foot of the San Bernardino 
Mountains, but her home, goats and iguana were saved by 
firefighters on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are our heroes,'' she said. ``I don't think I've ever had  
a hero before. We gave them coffee; they gave us our property.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Southern California firefighters also had their hands full in  
the San Gabriel Mountains, where a blaze on 7,000 acres of Angeles 
National Forest was 35 percent contained today. And in Riverside 
County, the 3,300-acre Mixing fire was completely surrounded 
Wednesday night, with control expected Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Northern California firefighters struggled with clusters of  
fires that have burned over thousands of acres in the 
Shasta-Trinity area and Plumas National Forest.

<HEADLINE> Reds vs. Braves: No Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Call it a hex. Call it a tradition. No matter  
how hard they try -- and maybe they're trying too hard -- the 
Cincinnati Reds just can't beat the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last three years, they've played the Braves 29 times and  
can count their victories on one hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time a club beats you up like they have, it seems like  
they have your number,'' Reds third baseman Aaron Boone said. 
</P>
<P>
	They have all the numbers: an 8-1 record against the Reds this  
season, including a pair of three-game sweeps in Atlanta; a 29-5 
mark over the last three years; eight consecutive series wins since 
September 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta's 8-7 victory Wednesday night completed their season  
series and left the Reds with an all-too-familiar feeling. The 
contending Reds are one of the major leagues' biggest surprises, 
but there are no surprises when they face the NL's top team. 
</P>
<P>
	They just don't measure up.  
</P>
<P>
	``From where we were at the beginning of the year to the club  
that we've become, we felt like we were ready to climb into that 
elite group of teams,'' Boone said. ``But to do that, you've got to 
be competitive against those teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's something of a mystery why they're not. The Reds have gone  
8-1 against NL West leader Arizona, 8-3 against NL Central leader 
Houston and 5-4 against the New York Mets, the other team currently 
in contention for a wild-card berth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves are an entirely different story. The Reds' only  
victory over them came Monday, when the Braves didn't get into town 
until 3:30 a.m. and got drubbed 11-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta went on to score 16 runs in the next two games.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad to see them get out of town,'' manager Jack McKeon  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reliever Mike Remlinger, who went to the Braves along with  
second baseman Bret Boone in the Denny Neagle trade last November, 
thinks the one-sided rivalry weighs on the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got that in the back of your head, even if you don't  
want it there,'' Remlinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe the Reds just try too hard.  
</P>
<P>
	``From being on the other side of it, I know when I pitched  
against the Braves I always tried to be on top of my game,'' 
Remlinger said. ``I think everybody feels that way. Whether they 
try to do more than they should or they're tight, I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds are inclined to think it's just one of those mysteries  
of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think of the other clubs that have given us a tough time --  
San Diego last year,'' manager Jack McKeon said. ``They did it to 
us. We've done it two years in a row to Arizona.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the Padres won 11 of 12 from the Reds. Over the past  
two seasons, the Reds have won 13 of 18 from the Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds-Braves matter goes back much farther and runs much  
deeper. It's been so lopsided that the Reds felt some relief after 
turning a 7-1 deficit into a one-run loss Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes it competitive and it makes it fun,'' shortstop Barry  
Larkin said. ``Of course you want to win. It's a good situation 
that we came back. It's a confidence builder. It's all about 
respect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves respect the Reds even as they beat them.  
</P>
<P>
	``We know they're for real,'' Bret Boone said. ``You don't play  
as good as they have to this point and be a fluke. We know we have 
to play our best against them. It just seems like when we've played 
them, we've played them very well.''

<HEADLINE> Mine Workers Union Fund Facing Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- A fund that pays health insurance to  
70,000 retired coal miners and their families is $13 million in 
debt and could start cutting benefits early next year, the 
president of the United Mine Workers said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Without some new source of funds, the multi-employer trust fund  
will face a shortage of $250 million within five years, said Cecil 
Roberts, the union's leader. 
</P>
<P>
	The trust fund, known as the UMW Combined Benefit Fund, ``can  
operate on a cash basis through the end of this year and into early 
next year,'' Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless a solution is found soon, there will be increasing  
pressure by some trustees to cut benefits as the CBF deficit 
continues to grow,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Combined Benefit Fund was established seven years ago by  
federal legislation. It is financed by premiums paid by some 300 
employers, current and former coal operators, and it pays out an 
estimated $1 million a day. 
</P>
<P>
	But the companies required to pay into the fund have brought  
more than 60 lawsuits, challenging everything from the law's 
constitutionality to the amount they were ordered to pay, which was 
established by the Social Security Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund has won most of the legal disputes, according to  
Michael Holland, co-chairman of the CBF's board of trustees. But at 
least three rulings have reduced assets by as much as $113 million, 
and if they remain in place they could cost as much as $400 million 
over the life of the fund, Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund's beneficiaries are an expensive group: 65 percent of  
them are women, generally miners' widows, and their average age is 
about 78. As a result, the cost of their health care is going up 
faster than that of the nation as a whole, Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts said the union is again working with Congress to develop  
a solution. 
</P>
<P>
	The union will hold meetings in Alabama, Indiana, West Virginia,  
Pennsylvania and Utah later this month to explain the situation to 
beneficiaries, and to enlist them in a campaign to persuade 
Congress to enact legislation to remedy the problem.

<HEADLINE> Most Water Violations Not Reported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. AP) -- Nearly 90 percent of all violations of the  
Safe Drinking Water Act are not reported in the government database 
that is supposed to alert consumers, according to a reported 
federal audit. 
</P>
<P>
	USA Today reported in today's editions that it obtained an  
Environmental Protection Agency audit that suggests there are tens 
of thousands more cases a year than previously documented in which 
water systems break safety rules. 
</P>
<P>
	It said 88 percent of violations go unreported, ranging from  
missed water quality tests to contamination problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's likely that regulators are unaware of many health risks  
to consumers that have been going on for extended periods,'' Erik 
Olson of the Natural Resources Defense Council told the paper. 
</P>
<P>
	The state-federal database audited by EPA is supposed to be the  
main source of information on 170,000 public water systems that 
must meet water quality and testing standards. 
</P>
<P>
	It also is the basis for an EPA Web site that lets consumers  
check local water system records. 
</P>
<P>
	USA Today said state officials note that all but about 10  
percent of the unreported violations involve failure to test 
properly and that many involved missed deadlines or other errors 
that may not involve safety.

<HEADLINE> Mo Vaughn: Why I Didn't Join Brawl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Mo Vaughn said he didn't join his Angels'  
teammates in a bench-clearing brawl with the Cleveland Indians 
because he wasn't in the dugout when the altercation started. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in brawls all my career,'' Vaughn said before  
Anaheim's 8-1 loss Wednesday to Cleveland. ``If I was down on the 
bench, I would have been in the brawl. But I was in the clubhouse 
watching the game on TV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The brawl took place after Angels reliever Troy Percival gave up  
a three-run homer in the eighth inning Tuesday to Richie Sexson, 
capping a 10-run rally by the Indians, who won the game 14-12. 
</P>
<P>
	Percival then hit David Justice, igniting the fight as both  
benches and bullpens emptied. Both Percival and Justice were 
ejected. 
</P>
<P>
	After the fight, Percival suggested that not all of his  
teammates were willing to join him in the brawl. When asked to be 
specific, he said ``Look at the tape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A television camera showed Vaughn, who was the designated hitter  
and wasn't on the field for the fight, watching as order was 
restored from the corner of the Anaheim dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn not only defended himself but criticized Percival for  
hitting Justice. ``Be like a man,'' he said. ``You get rapped 
around, don't throw at a guy. Get the next guy out and get out of 
the inning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Batting instructor Rod Carew brought Vaughn and Percival  
together for a short meeting that seemed to bring the matter to a 
close. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mo and I are fine, there's no problem there,'' Percival said.  
``To me, it's a non-issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Vaughn nor Percival played Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Murdoch Gives $10 Mil. to Cathedral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Rupert Murdoch on Thursday donated $10  
million to help complete construction of the $163 million Cathedral 
of Our Lady of the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	The money will be used to build a conference center that will  
adjoin the cathedral, according to Cardinal Roger Mahony. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cardinal Mahony's vision for this beautiful new cathedral and  
all that goes with it deserves everybody's support,'' said Murdoch, 
who is not Catholic. ``It will serve the people of Southern 
California as a whole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murdoch is chairman of News Corp., a worldwide media  
conglomerate that includes newspapers, the Fox television network, 
20th Century Fox film studio and satellite networks in Europe and 
Asia. Through Fox Sports, he also owns the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3,000-seat Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels is scheduled  
to open about mid-2001 in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	When finished, the cathedral complex will include a landscaped  
plaza, meditation garden, conference center, and a 
24,000-square-foot residence for Mahony, resident clergy and 
visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The cathedral will replace tiny St. Vibiana's Cathedral, which  
was damaged by the 1994 Northridge quake and closed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Murdochs have long recognized the importance of Los  
Angeles as a key city for the new century and millennium, and they 
are demonstrating in a significant fashion their commitment to

<HEADLINE> Biggest Insurer Covers New Pap Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Aetna Inc., the nation's largest health insurer,  
reversed itself Thursday and agreed to cover a new type of Pap 
smear test, which federal officials in 1996 said was more effective 
in detecting early signs of cervical cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, a top Aetna official said the ThinPrep PapTest would  
add $1 billion to health care costs nationwide without any proof 
that it is better than the conventional Pap smear test at saving 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Aetna said new, as yet unpublished studies show  
ThinPrep increases the detection of abnormal or precancerous cells. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that it is best to have the treating physician make  
the decision'' about which type of Pap test to use, said Dr. Arnold 
Cohen, an obstetrician-gynecologist in charge of Aetna's women's 
health programs. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to ThinPrep, Aetna said it will cover a similar  
test, PREP, made by AutoCyte, and an automated Pap test in which a 
computer, rather than a laboratory technician, scans Pap smear 
slides. 
</P>
<P>
	The coverage begins immediately.  
</P>
<P>
	The company's Aetna U.S. Healthcare unit, based in Blue Bell,  
Pa., provides health insurance to 21 million Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Insurance coverage is crucial because ThinPrep typically costs  
$25 to $30 per test compared to $7 to $10 for the conventional Pap 
test. Aetna said its costs would increase as a result of the new 
coverage, but said it was too early to estimate the amount. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna joins most of the major health insurers to cover ThinPrep,  
which was approved in 1996 but has struggled until recently to 
build demand. The only major insurer not to cover the test is 
Kaiser Permanente, the nation's second-largest health maintenance 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	A Kaiser official said last month that the company is looking  
into covering the newer test. 
</P>
<P>
	About 13 percent of the 50 million Pap smears performed in the  
United States are now done with ThinPrep, which is made by Cytyc 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	ThinPrep makes it easier for lab technicians to interpret Pap  
smears, and as a result find more abnormal or precancerous cells. 
</P>
<P>
	ThinPrep treats the cells with a liquid to remove blood and  
mucus that can hide cancerous changes. In November 1996, the 
federal government agreed that the Thin Prep system is more than 65 
percent more effective in diagnosing precancerous cells, which can 
lead to cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Named for Dr. George Papanicolaou, the pathologist who developed  
it in 1948, the Pap smear involves a doctor scraping cells from the 
cervix, at the neck of the uterus. 
</P>
<P>
	The cells are smeared onto a glass slide and sent to a lab,  
where a technician reads the slide under a microscope. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Pap smear is far from infallible. It misses problems  
about 20 percent of the time, according to the National Institutes 
of Health, usually because of poor cervical samples or difficulty 
reading the slides at the lab. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a big deal,'' said Tom Gunderson, an analyst at Piper  
Jaffray, said of Aetna's decision. ``It is not only nice for Aetna 
and its customers, but is a tremendous boon for Cytyc's 
psychology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Cytyc rose $2, or nearly 6 percent, to close at  
$36.56 1/4 Thursday on the Nasdaq Stock Market. ``This is just perfect 
for us,'' said Jeff Kelly, Cytyc's chief financial officer. ``It 
will lead many more women to get the test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many doctors and health insurers initially were hesitant to  
replace the conventional diagnostic test that led to a big drop in 
cervical cancer deaths with a pricier version. Critics claimed that 
the new test was no better than the conventional one at identifying 
cancer, and argued ThinPrep would result in too many false 
warnings, thus unnecessarily alarming patients. 
</P>
<P>
	ThinPrep's increasing market share comes as Cytyc, based in  
Boxborough, Mass., has convinced more big health insurers -- 
including several Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans -- that the new 
test is worth the extra expense. Other major insurers that cover 
ThinPrep include United HealthCare, Cigna and Foundation Health. 
Another major insurer, Humana, provides partial coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Insurance coverage has led more doctors to order the test, and  
more women to request it. 
</P>
<P>
	Aetna's Cohen said the new studies show ThinPrep helps detect  
more serious abnormal cells, which have a strong likelihood of 
becoming cancerous. He said older studies involved too few women, 
and showed the test only detected the type of abnormal cells that 
most likely would not become cancerous. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said the most important way to prevent cervical cancer is  
to get a regular Pap test, not which type of test to use.

<HEADLINE> Detroit Strike Not Affecting Unions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Striking teachers stayed out of classrooms for a  
fourth day Thursday as school officials refused to back down on a 
plan to grant merit bonuses to every employee of an improved 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	The bonus plan is one sticking point with teachers, who say the  
plan fails to reward excellent teachers who happen to work in 
schools that perform poorly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have issues that haven't been resolved,'' said Jim  
Amar, a state mediator appointed Aug. 24 to sit in on the 
negotiations between the board and the Detroit Federation of 
Teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	There was at least one concession.  
</P>
<P>
	David Adamany, the chief executive of the 172,000-student  
district, agreed Wednesday to withdraw a proposal to extend the 
school day by 2 hours, to 8 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, teachers would not oppose having aides and other  
non-teaching personnel work longer days so the district could offer 
after-school programs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Adamany remained committed to his proposal to reward schools  
meeting test score and attendance targets by granting ``merit 
bonuses'' to every employee in that school -- including custodians 
and secretaries. 
</P>
<P>
	As bargaining resumed Thursday afternoon, the union in turn was  
digging in against the bonus plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Danic, an English teacher at Osborn High School, said the  
plan would reward teachers at what he called ``showcase schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The inequity of the worst teacher in a good school receiving a  
bonus, but not a good teacher in a bad school, is totally unfair,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The district and the union representing 9,200 teachers also were  
sparring over issues including salary, class size and sick days. 
</P>
<P>
	The board and union President John Elliott early Monday morning  
agreed to extend the teachers' contract 10 days beyond its Monday 
expiration date. But several thousand union members bolted from 
Elliott that day during a raucous meeting at which they rejected 
the extension and voted to strike instead. 
</P>
<P>
	The strike has put at least a temporary halt to reform efforts  
led by Adamany since he took the job in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. John Engler, who signed legislation shifting control of the  
district from the elected board to an appointed board that hired 
Adamany, said the change was necessary to shore up lagging test 
scores, chronically low attendance and graduation rates in the 
nation's 10th-largest city.

<HEADLINE>  Fryman Back With Indians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Travis Fryman feels like it's February and he's  
down in Florida at spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	Fryman, sidelined since July with a torn ligament in his right  
knee, was recalled from a rehabilitation assignment on Thursday by 
the Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like starting over to some extent,'' said Fryman, who  
played third base in the ninth inning of Thursday night's 6-5 
victory over the Anaheim Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	Fryman tore the posterior collateral ligament in his knee after  
colliding with Kansas City first baseman Jeremy Giambi in a July 3 
game. He went on the DL the next day for just the second time in 
his career. Earlier this year, he was sidelined with back spasms 
and made his first trip to the DL in nine seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Fryman, now wearing a large brace on his knee, began a 20-day  
rehab stint for Double-A Akron and Triple-A Buffalo on Aug. 24. He 
batted a combined .217 (5-for-23) with two homers and six RBIs in 
seven games. He played some third base but used primarily as a 
designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	With the postseason nearing, Fryman wanted to get in at least 30  
games with the Indians so he could get himself ready for October. 
He said he hasn't had to slide yet and is still not running as well 
as he would like. 
</P>
<P>
	Fryman, who was not in the Indians' starting lineup Thursday  
night but could see some action, said his knee is pain free but 
that he hasn't been able to test it like he wants. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can work in the weight room, but the athleticism it takes  
to play you can't really duplicate,'' he said. ``You can take 
fungoes all day long, but reacting to balls off the bat and things 
like that you can only replicate in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fryman said the brace, which goes from his lower thigh to his  
calf, doesn't restrict what he can do defensively. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be limited in some extent,'' he said. ``Not the  
brace as much as the injury. It's not an injury you bounce right 
back from a few weeks later and you're 100 percent. It takes a 
period of time to get where you were, but at this time it's doing 
pretty well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To make room for Fryman, the Indians transferred catcher Sandy  
Alomar from the 15- to 60-day disabled list. Alomar, sidelined 
since May 17 following knee surgery, will begin a 20-day rehab 
stint Friday with Akron. 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar, too, is hoping to be ready for the postseason.  
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove, who could use Fryman at DH to get him some at-bats,  
has had to juggle his lineup and starting rotation all season 
because of injuries. He's happy that Fryman, one of the Indians 
leaders, is available to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to have one of your guys back, especially one you  
can depend on,'' he said. ``Hopefully, we can get him sharp enough 
where he can contribute during the postseason.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fall Further; Dow Off 196.30 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks widened their losses today as concerns  
about inflation and interest rates were compounded by a dismal 
earnings outlook from Sears, Roebuck and Co. 
</P>
<P>
	In mid-afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones  
industrial average was down 196.30 at 10,741.58 after having risen 
108 points on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was down 20.90 at 1,310.17, and the Nasdaq composite 
index was down 32.31 at 2,718.49. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks resumed an end-of-summer slump as a slew of bad news hit  
Wall Street. Above all, markets are under heavy pressure from 
continuing fears that the Federal Reserve has not yet completed its 
efforts to ward off inflation by imposing higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, those fears grew as Federal Reserve Gov. Edward Kelley  
told Market News International it would be premature to assume the 
Fed will wait until next year to raise rates again. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed raised rates June 30 and Aug. 24, providing a temporary  
lift to the market both times as hopes grew that the central bank 
would make no further moves. But sporadic hints of inflationary 
pressures have kept the Fed on alert and investors on edge. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the Labor Department said the growth of American workers'  
productivity slowed considerably in the spring, while labor costs 
jumped sharply. That bad news sent the yield on the 30-year 
Treasury bond climbing to 6.14 percent from 6.08 percent late 
Wednesday. Bonds are especially sensitive to inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rising long-bond yield is deadly for stocks,'' said Larry  
Wachtel, market analyst with Prudential Securities. High yields can 
lure investors away from stocks as they seek out stable, guaranteed 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was also on guard in advance of the Labor  
Department's employment report, due out on Friday, just before the 
long holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who's going to take a stand today when they know they could  
get clobbered tomorrow if that number is bad?'' Wachtel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Sears weighed most heavily on the Dow after saying its  
third-quarter net income will come in at 63 cents to 67 cents a 
share, well below analysts' forecast of 82 cents. Sears stock fell 
4 7/16 to 32 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Other major retailers also fell, although some announced strong  
August sales figures. Wal-Mart, which said sales from stores open 
at least a year rose 8.7 percent compared with August 1998, slipped 
1/8 to 44 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's financial services companies also tumbled. Banks and  
brokerages are often the first companies to feel the pinch of 
higher interest rates, because lending volume generally shrinks as 
it becomes more expensive to borrow money. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-1 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 463.75 million 
shares, slightly behind Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 4.04 to 426.95.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Near End of Their Vacation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- A summer vacation that put President  
Clinton's lame-duck status on uncomfortable display neared a close 
Thursday with a pair of fund-raisers for the family's newly minted 
politician -- the president's wife. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons also agreed to purchase a $1.7 million house in a  
New York City suburb, giving Hillary Rodham Clinton the New York 
residence she needs if she runs for the U.S. Senate next year. 
</P>
<P>
	While the president golfed, lounged and gave a handful of  
political speeches, much of the 16-day trip to Massachusetts and 
New York focused on Mrs. Clinton's presumed candidacy. She expected 
to raise about $800,000 for her exploratory campaign committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The president expects to move into the five-bedroom, three-story  
home in Chappaqua, Westchester County, when his term ends in 
January 2001. To qualify as a candidate, Mrs. Clinton must 
establish residency by Election Day in November 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he has 17 months left in his term, Clinton is clearly  
thinking about his future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can work for cheap,'' he told a New Yorker this week. ``I've  
got a good pension.'' At another point he noted, ``I'm looking for 
a new role.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons spent more than half their vacation in New York,  
forsaking a second week on the Massachusetts resort island of 
Martha's Vineyard where they have been summer regulars during 
Clinton's more than six years in office. They are to head to Camp 
David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton seemed both delighted and unsettled by the enthusiastic  
reception Mrs. Clinton drew during their first joint trip to New 
York state since she formed the exploratory committee. It marked 
the first time that Clinton campaigned on her behalf and helped 
raise money for the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are asking me how I'm reacting to this whole deal,'' he  
said Thursday night at a fund-raiser for the first lady. ``I love 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he plainly laments that his own time is waning and that he  
cannot run for president again. ``I hate it, actually,'' he told 
supporters last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	In upstate New York this week, the president watched as crowds  
chanted and cheered for Mrs. Clinton, and the route of his 
motorcade near the Syracuse-area golf course where he played 
Thursday was lined with signs that read: ``Go Hillary!'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the second time in a week, Clinton played the round with a  
group of eight instead of the traditional foursome. His party of 
upstate New York Democrats and business leaders included the 
majority leader of the New York Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton drove his own cart -- the only driving his cosseted life  
of limousines and helicopters allows him -- and went wide at the 
first turn off a paved cart path. 
</P>
<P>
	A gallery of club members at the Lafayette Golf and Country Club  
chuckled when Clinton headed the wrong way a few minutes later and 
had to pull a U-turn around a dead pine tree. Many of the carts in 
an unofficial motorcade behind him followed suit.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Machinists Approve Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Members of Boeing's biggest union were on the job  
Thursday after signing off on their new three-year contract with a 
resounding 86 percent yes vote, the biggest margin of approval in 
their history with the aerospace giant. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to send a message to corporate America that labor is  
back,'' said an exultant Bill Johnson, president of the 
International Aerospace Machinists' Seattle-based District Lodge 
751. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it's an inspiration. We've seen major setbacks in the  
labor movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The contract was approved 26,842-4,328 late Wednesday, with a 71  
percent turnout from the 44,000 Machinists members in Washington, 
Oregon and Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	The pact got a boost from Boeing Chairman and CEO Phil Condit,  
who stepped in personally to end a prickly bargaining stalemate 
last weekend and lobbied hard this week -- in newspaper, radio and 
TV ads -- to get it accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	Machinists interviewed outside polling places called the pact  
``a miracle'' and a morale-booster. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's probably the best Boeing's ever offered. They know a  
strike would hurt their future efforts to sell planes,'' said 
Ulysses Phillips, a punch-press operator in Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the climate in the business world right now, the  
competition with Airbus (Industrie), the workers at Boeing got some 
recognition for their hard efforts,'' said Jeffrey Tazioli, who 
assembles wings at the suburban Auburn plant. ``Our efforts have 
been rewarded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Up until last Friday, negotiations were deadlocked and workers  
were preparing for a strike. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were tired. Their morale was bad,'' said Kevin Mims,  
quality insurance inspector in Renton. When they saw Boeing's final 
contract offer Saturday, he said, ``Everyone was like, 'Yee-haw!''' 
</P>
<P>
	The old contract expired at 12:01 a.m. Thursday. The Machinists  
have struck over two of the last three contracts, most recently for 
69 days in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract offered two annual wage increases of 4 percent and  
a third-year 3 percent raise, as well as a 10 percent signing bonus 
worth $4,400 to the average machinist. It also holds steady worker 
contributions to health insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
	The only opposition to the agreement focused on retirement  
benefits and job security. 
</P>

	Boeing offered a 25 percent increase in pensions, to $50 a month  
per year of service -- well below the 300 percent increase sought by 
the union. The contract offer also guaranteed ``no layoffs as the

<HEADLINE> Seniors Break in New Course  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The most famous part-time caddy on the  
Senior PGA Tour will be available for only one round of the TD 
Waterhouse Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City Royals great George Brett has other commitments  
Saturday and Sunday, the final two rounds of the 54-hole tournament 
that begins Friday at Tiffany Springs Golf Club, a new course that 
has felt the effects of drought. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year on the Loch Lloyd course south of Kansas City, Brett  
caddied all the way for close friend Larry Ziegler, who edged Tom 
Shaw by one stroke for his second Senior Tour victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``George can only be here on Friday,'' Ziegler said. ``Since he  
was inducted into the Hall of Fame this summer, it's unbelievable 
how hectic his life is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ziegler, who had angioplasty surgery seven weeks ago, faces a  
much tougher field this year. The par-72, 6,820-yard Tiffany Greens 
layout is minutes from Kansas City International Airport and 
surrounded by hotels, making it more attractive to the seniors. 
</P>
<P>
	Loch Loyd was more than an hour from the airport and 20 minutes  
from the nearest hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's event had just six of the top 20 money-winners. This  
time there are 17 of the top 20, including five-time winner on this 
year's tour Bruce Fleisher, Dana Quigley, Gil Morgan, Hale Irwin 
and Dave Eichelberger. 
</P>
<P>
	One senior who will not be competing for the $180,000 first  
place money is hometown favorite Tom Watson. He did not reach his 
50th birthday -- minimum age for Senior Tour entrants -- until later 
in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City officials were denied a special exemption. They had  
hoped Watson's birthday could be fudged by a few days, allowing him 
to play before what certainly would have been a larger gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you start changing regulations for those kind of reasons,  
you run the risk of raising questions of credibility about the 
entire rules structure,'' PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem said. 
``From the standpoint of credibility, it didn't seem like it made a 
lot of sense, although we would have loved to have Tom play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tiffany Springs course opened in May and has suffered in the  
intense heat and drought that has gripped the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our agronomist looked at it in July and said it was  
terrific,'' Finchem said. ``But then they've had some heat stress 
and drought. Heat and drought affect the new root structure more 
than an older, mature golf course. But everybody's been working 
hard. I think given the circumstances, we'll be fine. The players 
like the layout and we've got a great field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ziegler figures the winning score could be as much as 18 under  
par. 
</P>
<P>
	``The greens were absolutely immaculate, and now the weather has  
really torn them up,'' he said. ``But you can't control what nature 
does. I think the guys will forgive that. I don't think they'll 
berate the course because of what nature has done. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good layout. How the wind blows and where they put the  
pins, especially on the par-3s will go a long way toward dictating 
how good the scores will be.''

<HEADLINE> Rates Rise on 30-Year Mortgages / National Mortgage Survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average interest rate on 30-year  
fixed-rate mortgages edged up to 7.83 percent this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The average was up from 7.80 percent last week, according to a  
weekly survey released Thursday by Freddie Mac, the mortgage 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Mortgages rates have been on an upward climb. So far this year,  
average rates on a 30-year mortgage have hit a low of 6.74 percent 
set at the end of January and the new high of 8.15 percent set two 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing,  
averaged 7.45 percent this week, also up from the average of 7.43 
percent last week. 
</P>
<P>
	On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an  
average initial rate of 6.18 percent this week, down from 6.22 
percent the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which  
averaged at or just over 1 percent of the loan amount for all three 
types of mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Mortgage Bankers Association said that mortgage  
loan applications for the week ending Aug. 27 increase 4.5 percent 
from the previous week but were down 25.7 percent compared to the 
same week last year.

<HEADLINE> Bush: Don't Fund Bad Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate George W.  
Bush said Thursday that federal funds should be confiscated from 
the worst-performing schools and made available to parents for 
private education, tutoring or ``whatever offers hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``More and more, we are divided into two nations, separate and  
unequal,'' the Texas governor said in prepared remarks to a 
Hispanic business group. ``One that reads and one that can't. One 
that dreams and one that doesn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his most detailed education policy speech to date, Bush said  
he would withhold federal money earmarked for poor schoolchildren 
from schools that fail year after year. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Bush's plan, every school getting Title I money would be  
required to test its impoverished students on basic academics each 
year. A warning would be issued to schools that fail to make 
progress toward state standards. After three years of no progress, 
the Title I money would be matched with other federal education 
money and given to the state, which would set up an education 
account -- about $1,500 a year -- for each affected student. 
</P>
<P>
	The parents could choose how to spend the money. They could keep  
the money and their child in the original school or opt for an 
alternative, including private school and tutoring -- ``for whatever 
offers hope,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government currently spends $7.7 billion on Title I to help  
educate poor children. 
</P>
<P>
	A Bush aide said the plan would require states to create  
mechanisms for ensuring parents spent the money on education. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my administration, federal money will no longer flow to  
failure,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP presidential front-runner said he would halt federal  
spending on ``sloppy and trendy'' programs. 
</P>
<P>
	He promised to require every federal program affecting teacher  
training, curriculum research and school safety to prove results. 
Those that didn't would be stripped of their funding. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also proposed shifting the $4.4 billion Head Start program  
from the Department of Health and Human Services to the Education 
Department, a step he said would return the program's focus to 
preparing disadvantaged preschoolers for the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Invoking the buzzwords often heard in school-reform efforts in  
California, Texas and many other states, Bush said schools must 
establish a few clear goals that help measure students' basic 
skills. Testing helps ensure they achieve them, he said. And 
someone must take responsibility when they fail, he said, singling 
out principals. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, he said, local control of schools is essential  
to meeting the goals. 
</P>
<P>
	His proposal allowing federal money to flow to private  
institutions drew immediate fire from opponents, who say such 
arrangements siphon taxpayer money away from public schools that 
need it. 
</P>
<P>
	Education Secretary Richard Riley said he saw similarities  
between Bush's proposal and those of his brother Jeb, who as 
Florida's governor pushed through the nation's first statewide 
voucher plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter how you dress it up, how long you delay it, or what  
you call it, a voucher is a voucher,'' Riley said. ``Gov. George W. 
Bush would have us start down the road of accountability, then take 
a dangerous detour into vouchers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We would be against a plan like this,'' said Reginald Felton,  
director of federal relations for the National School Boards 
Association. ``The objective is to raise the academic achievement 
of all students.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But at a Title I elementary school Bush visited Thursday, the  
idea of vouchers won cautious support from two teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is a good idea, because sometimes private schools  
have a lot more to offer -- more personal, smaller classes,'' said 
teacher Joann Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	She and fellow teacher Janet Leinin didn't believe that such  
programs would rob Bennett-Kew Elementary School of students and 
the public money that follows them, because, they said, it is 
academically one of the strongest in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush delivered his remarks in a state where voters have soundly  
rejected proposals to allow public money for private schools, an 
arrangement often referred to as school vouchers. 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, Bush has backed a proposed pilot program for  
taxpayer-funded vouchers for private school tuition. State 
lawmakers have declined to pass the proposal ever since Bush became 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month a federal judge halted a voucher program in Ohio,  
saying it appeared to have the ``primary effect of advancing 
religion'' because it allowed public money to be used for religious 
and other private schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge later said the program can remain in place for  
students who participated in the program last year, but said that 
would last only one semester or until a final judgment is reached 
in a lawsuit claiming the program violates the constitutional 
separation of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush offered a forceful defense of such programs.  
</P>
<P>
	``All monopolies are slow to reform when consumers have no power  
to express their frustration,'' he said. ``In education, parents 
who have options have influence.''

<HEADLINE>  U.N. Demands Security in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- U.N. officials in East Timor pleaded with  
Indonesian security forces today to better protect them, one day 
after fighting between pro- and anti-independence supporters killed 
at least three people near the world body's compound. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, Indonesia said it might allow a U.N. peacekeeping  
force into East Timor, apparently backing away from its earlier 
stance that it alone would provide security to the territory. 
</P>
<P>
	``The possibility is not closed for the government to allow the  
United Nations to deploy a U.N. peacekeeping force in East Timor, 
but this matter has not been discussed by the government,'' State 
Secretary Muladi told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the situation in East Timor worsens, I think the  
possibility for that would be worth considering,'' said Muladi, 
President B.J. Habibie's top aide. Muladi, like many Indonesians, 
uses one name. 
</P>
<P>
	In Canberra, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said  
planning already was under way ``for a United Nations security 
presence to be brought in place in East Timor,'' but only with 
Indonesia's consent. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of East Timorese were leaving the city of Dili today  
to avoid being targeted by more violence, residents said. Rumors 
were sweeping through Dili that there would soon be a wave of 
assaults by pro-Indonesian militiamen against people who voted for 
independence. The militiamen are believed to be backed by the 
Indonesian military. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no possibility of protecting either ourselves -- our  
international staff, our local staff -- or anybody else, other than 
the pressure we can put upon the Indonesian authorities to fulfill 
their responsibilities,'' said Ian Martin, head of the U.N. 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S., Australian, Portuguese and U.N. officials in New York also  
strongly criticized Indonesia's slow response to the violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Armed with homemade guns, rifles and machetes, hundreds of  
militiamen clashed Wednesday with rock-throwing independence 
supporters outside U.N. headquarters in the provincial capital. 
</P>
<P>
	At least three people were killed near the U.N. buildings,  
including one who was hacked to death by militiamen armed with 
machetes, U.N. officials and witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian soldiers and police stood by without intervening as  
hundreds of people and dozens of journalists fled the scene. It 
took more than an hour for riot police to arrive and disperse the 
militants. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence came as ballots from Monday's historic referendum  
were being counted in Dili, East Timor's capital. The 
U.N.-sponsored vote asked the mostly Roman Catholic East Timorese 
whether they wanted to become independent or remain part of mostly 
Muslim Indonesia as an autonomous region. 
</P>
<P>
	East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, has been a province of  
Indonesia since being invaded in 1975. After decades of human 
rights abuses and international condemnation, Indonesia reversed 
policy in January and announced East Timor would be given the right 
of self-determination. 
</P>
<P>
	The outcome of the referendum won't be known until next week,  
but the high turnout left many people assuming the pro-independence 
supporters could win by a landslide. 
</P>
<P>
	Muladi also said today that more than 200,000 East Timorese,  
nearly one-quarter of the population, may flee from the province if 
voters there have chosen independence. Muladi did not provide the 
basis for his estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the refugees could be Indonesian loyalists fearing  
reprisals from independence supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Clashes between anti-independence militiamen and supporters of  
independence have raised fears that East Timor could slide back 
into lawlessness. 
</P>
<P>
	Many stores in Dili remained closed today, and there were few  
cars and pedestrians on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of East Timorese were leaving the city in fear, going  
back to their home villages or to the safety of mountains outside 
the capital, residents in Dili said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin urged the Indonesian government to take responsibility  
for protecting U.N. officials and residents in the tense capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin said Wednesday's attack outside the U.N. compound was not  
directed at its buildings or staff members, but at residents who 
want to see the territory become independent from Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is clear that we would not be in a position to have  
prevented the worst violence if the mob had indeed attempted to 
attack the compound itself,'' Martin told a news conference in 
Dili. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin said Indonesia's military commander, Gen. Wiranto, had  
ordered additional security for U.N. staff and premises in East 
Timor. That includes the Dili Museum building, where ballots from 
the referendum are being counted. It has not been attacked. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia's government sent 360 additional police to Dili today.  
Martin also said security forces had set up a road block to the 
west of Dili to prevent anti-independence militiamen from coming 
into the town from areas that they control. 
</P>
<P>
	Using a special C-130 flight, the military evacuated journalists  
who had been threatened or attacked. 
</P>
<P>
	In another development, an independent election commission began  
hearing complaints by the anti-independence movement that local 
U.N. officials had cheated during the referendum by encouraging, 
and even forcing, illiterate villages to vote for independence.

<HEADLINE> Mississippi School Furor Is Complex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROBINSONVILLE, Miss. (AP) -- A fracas over where to build the new  
Robinsonville Elementary School has grown so complex, so divisive, 
that some in this low-lying Delta community are calling it simply 
``The Big Mess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And no wonder. The U.S. Justice Department, the Congressional  
Black Caucus, the state attorney general, a powerful Mississippi 
developer, a New York City law firm and sundry civil rights groups 
are all weighing in on what, on the surface, looks like a local 
flap. 
</P>
<P>
	Below the surface, issues of race and power are merging with  
Tunica County's grim legacy of separate and unequal education to 
cast national attention on the proposed new school, a $5 million 
showcase hugging a planned upscale development. 
</P>
<P>
	The struggle also underscores a challenge faced far and wide --  
making sure that when new wealth comes to poor areas, the schools 
and other attendant social services are not limited to mere 
enclaves. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is pitiful this mess has gotten to this point,'' said a  
downcast Floy Siggers, a mother of 11 and PTA president. ``But rich 
people are always trying to pull something over on the poor 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For generations, expansive cotton fields provided the lifeblood  
for this predominately black county of about 8,600 residents near 
the Mississippi River in the state's northwest corner. But now, 
casinos are king. 
</P>
<P>
	Built along the river, 13 new gambling parlors are bringing  
visitors and wealth to Tunica County, until recently the second 
poorest in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight centers on a plan, championed by local and state  
education officials, to build a tony new public elementary school 
on land sold to the school district by a developer who is building 
an expensive housing project next to it. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hundred homes are planned. The single family dwellings  
would sell for more than $100,000 and bring a contemporary look to 
a town where double-wide trailer homes and ramshackle dwellings 
dominate. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics, including the local NAACP and Rep. Bennie Thompson,  
D-Miss., say the homes will be outside the price range of almost 
all blacks and will be bought mainly by white casino executives 
moving to the area. 
</P>
<P>
	The result, they say, will be a new, virtually all-white public  
school in an affluent pocket -- and an affront to longtime residents 
left with substandard schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want a new school. But locate it where our black children  
can benefit too,'' said Melvin Young of Concerned Citizens for a 
Better Tunica County. 
</P>
<P>
	The state officials involved, who are mostly white, and the  
civic officials pushing the project, who are mostly black, say the 
school will relieve overcrowding generally, just one way they see 
the gambling industry's tide lifting all boats. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because it's Mississippi, everyone is looking for injustice to  
black people,'' said James Dunn, a black member of the county board 
of supervisors. ``But Tunica County is growing and changing. 
Everyone here knows Robinsonville isn't going to become all-white 
any time soon, if ever. We need a new school for our children 
today. '' 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson said he might believe officials were taking black  
people's best interests at heart if not for the history of 
education in Tunica County. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education decision ruling school  
segregation unconstitutional meant little in Tunica County early 
on. White parents first sidestepped the law by holding whites-only 
classes in churches. Later, they created a system of private 
academies. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1970, a federal judge signed a desegregation order that is in  
effect today. Its effectiveness in bringing black and white 
children together was negligible. 
</P>
<P>
	Just 39 white children, but 2,000 black children, attend the  
county's four public schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the county's private school, the Tunica Institute for  
Learning, is almost all-white. 
</P>
<P>
	``White parents there have never sent their kids to the public  
school system,'' said Thompson, who got 25 black members of 
Congress to sign a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno denouncing 
the current site. ``And now they expect us to believe they've had a 
change of heart. Well, I don't believe it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department also had doubts.  
</P>
<P>
	Reasoning that building the school in the subdivision would  
violate the spirit of the 1970 integration order for Tunica County, 
the department ruled last September against the school's planned 
location. The department has jurisdiction over major education 
decisions in the county under the decree. 
</P>
<P>
	Local school officials called in Mississippi Attorney General  
Michael Moore, who promptly set up meetings with Justice officials 
extolling the virtues of the current site. In a June letter to 
Reno, Moore said he was advising the district to build even though 
it hadn't received federal approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a strategic move that worked because we got a meeting  
(with the Justice Department),'' Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the department is reconsidering its position and a final  
decision is expected soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore disputes predictions that the school will become an  
all-white island in a sea of poorer black pupils. 
</P>
<P>
	Only nine of the homes have been built so far, and Moore says if  
the school were to open tomorrow more than 250 black students 
living nearby would attend. The school is planned to hold about 500 
pupils. 
</P>
<P>
	PTA president Siggers says one solution would be to move the  
school just a few miles south -- essentially meeting the existing 
black school population half way. 
</P>
<P>
	Local officials don't want to pay for land or services in a  
different location. 
</P>
<P>
	Mississippi activists opposed to the school are being advised by  
The Advancement Project, a public policy advocacy group with 
offices in Washington and Los Angeles. That group brought in a New 
York law firm that is donating its services. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides in the Big Mess agree on one thing: If no compromise  
is reached, a lawsuit from the loser is a certainty.

<HEADLINE> House Panel Seeks Puerto Rico Facts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House panel is demanding the Clinton  
administration hand over records on 16 militant Puerto Rican 
nationalists who were offered clemency by the president. 
</P>
<P>
	The Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, headed by Rep.  
Dan Burton, R-Ind., on Wednesday issued subpoenas to the White 
House and Justice Department. Information the Bureau of Prisons 
provided to the Justice Department was also subpoenaed. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton offered immediate freedom to 11 of 16 prisoners last  
month in exchange for renunciations of the use of violence, a 
decision that has drawn a firestorm of criticism. Two others would 
have to serve additional prison time before release; and three 
would have the unpaid balance of their criminal fines canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Jake Siewert today defended the clemency  
offer. ``We made that decision on the merits and the president 
stands by the decision,'' he said. ``Congress can do whatever it 
wants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile in a parallel investigation, Sen. Orrin Hatch,  
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, also requested 
information from the Justice Department in anticipation of expected 
congressional hearings on the politically charged matter later this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	In his letter to Attorney General Janet Reno, Hatch, R-Utah,  
said he was troubled by published reports indicating the Justice 
Department had not made a formal recommendation to the White House 
on the clemency issue, despite the vigorous objections of the law 
enforcement community. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was also bothered by reports that the Bureau of  
Prisons had recordings of the inmates in question in which they 
allegedly plotted to again use violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hope that, on a matter of such importance, the  
Department of Justice, and the attorney general in particular, 
would make its views known to the White House,'' Hatch wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bureau of Prisons has declined to confirm or deny existence  
of the tapes but a spokesman did say that inmates' social calls are 
routinely monitored by officials. The Justice Department did not 
immediately return a phone call seeking comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's clemency offer has outraged the law enforcement  
community and Republicans; some accuse Clinton of using it to help 
his wife's all-but-announced Senate candidacy from New York. The 
state is home to nearly 1.3 million Puerto Ricans. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Jim Kennedy called that assertion  
``absolutely false'' but said he could not comment on the issue of 
the subpoena itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Even some Democrats oppose the clemency offer.  
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the retiring New York Democrat  
whose seat Mrs. Clinton is eyeing, is opposed to it, his chief of 
staff, Tony Bullock, said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who sits on the  
Judiciary Committee, which is likely to hold hearings on the 
matter, said he wanted more information. 
</P>
<P>
	``The senator's position is that he wants the clemency reports  
to be released because he wants this issue to be decided on a 
case-by-case basis,'' Schumer spokeswoman Michelle Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Clinton said he would commute the sentences of 16  
FALN members if they disavowed the use of violence. Human rights 
officials have argued that the sentences of the 16 -- ranging from 
15 years to 90 years in prison -- were too harsh given that none of 
the 16 was convicted of involvement in any deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the FALN -- the Spanish initials for Armed Forces of  
National Liberation -- staged some 130 bomb attacks on political and 
military targets in the United States between 1974 and 1983. The 
attacks killed six people and wounded dozens more.

<HEADLINE> Facts on Bush-Education Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Facts and figures about the Title I program, which Republican  
presidential candidate George W. Bush proposed revising Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	WHAT: Title I, the main education program for poor and other  
educationally disadvantaged children is the cornerstone of the 1965 
Elementary and Secondary Education Act governing federal 
kindergarten-through-12th grade programs. 
</P>
<P>
	WHO BENEFITS: The program -- the largest K-12 program, with  
funding of $8.36 billion in fiscal 1999 -- serves 11 million of the 
nation's 58 million schoolchildren. All states receive the funding. 
Local districts tend to concentrate most of their Title I dollars 
in schools they deem have the most need. 
</P>
<P>
	PURPOSE: Title I is aimed at narrowing the gap in academic  
achievement between low-income students and their peers by 
providing supplemental funding to poor school districts. More than 
$120 billion has been funneled into Title I since its inception, 
making it one of the largest single federal investments in 
education. 
</P>
<P>
	DISTRIBUTION: The Education Department distributes Title I  
grants to states to give to individual schools based on a formula 
that takes into account how many of a school's students are living 
in poverty and what a given state spends on education per child. 
</P>
<P>
	HISTORY: Created in 1965 during the War on Poverty, Title I  
serves poor and disadvantaged children in nearly every school 
district in the country. In 1994, the law was changed to allow 
schools with 50 percent poor students to use the money on all 
students, rather than providing extra help to a limited number of 
students. Title I was formerly known as ``Chapter 1.'' 
</P>
<P>
	PRIVATE SCHOOLS: Private schools or a consortium of private  
schools are not eligible to receive Title I funds. Only a public 
school district can receive funds. 
</P>
<P>
	FUTURE: This fall, Congress will debate the reauthorization of  
ESEA and Title I. Republican leaders have criticized the program 
after reports that poor children lag behind other children in 
achievement.

<HEADLINE> Campbell Soup Profits Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- Campbell Soup Co. on Thursday reported a 30  
percent drop in profits from continuing operations for its fourth 
quarter, citing a restructuring charge, flat sales and higher 
advertising and administrative costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's biggest soup maker said profits from continuing  
operations fell to $121 million for the three months ended Aug. 1, 
compared with $173 million a year earlier. Earnings per share from 
continuing operations were 28 cents, missing analysts' forecasts by 
a penny. 
</P>
<P>
	Including a $36 million charge for a global restructuring  
program announced in June and a 24 percent jump in sales and 
administration costs, net income for the fourth quarter plunged 57 
percent. It fell to $79 million, or 18 cents per share, from $182 
million, or 40 cents per share, in 1998's last quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fiscal 1999 has been a difficult year of transition,'' said  
Dale F. Morrison, president and chief executive officer. ``These 
results are disappointing, but the supply chain decisions we made 
this year will pay dividends in fiscal 2000 and beyond. In 
addition, we believe our investment in new product development 
across our portfolio positions us well for the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Campbell closed down 68 3/4 cents, at $43.56 1/4, on the New  
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For the 1999 fiscal year, net earnings were up 10 percent, to  
$72 for million, or $1.63 per share, 10 cents below the consensus 
of analysts surveyed by First Call. That compares with net earnings 
of $660 million, or $1.44 per share, for fiscal 1998, when results 
were hurt by a $262 million restructuring charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the 1999 fiscal year were $6.4 billion, down 4 percent  
from $6.7 billion a year earlier. For the fourth quarter, sales 
were virtually unchanged at $1.296 billion, compared with $1.299 
billion in 1998's fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The only bright spot was in the company's fledgling ``away from  
home'' category, including Campbell's soups sold through 
convenience stores and college cafeterias. Sales in that category 
rose 10 percent in the fourth quarter, to $124 million, and were up 
12 percent for the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell, the country's sixth-biggest food company, predicted in  
late June, when earnings forecasts were 38 cents per share, that 
results would be as much as 10 cents below analysts' expectations 
back in late June. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, the company announced a reorganization that  
combines its U.S. soup and sauce operations with its Canadian 
business to form the Campbell North America Soup and Sauce 
Division. The realignment is aimed at cutting costs and helping the 
company focus on growing its core market. Outside the United 
States, Canada is Campbell's biggest soup buyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell also sells food under the Pepperidge Farm, Godiva  
chocolate, Prego sauces, V-8 juices and Pace salsa brands. 
</P>
<P>
	Morrison said the company is funding product development and  
testing partly from productivity savings of about $150 million in 
the 1998 fiscal year, and it expects bigger savings in the current 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the new products in or headed for test markets are the  
Stockpot refrigerated soup brand, soups in microwavable or 
resealable containers, a new condensed soup called ``Mega 
Noodles,'' and ``Campbell's Plus,'' a new line of soups fortified 
with vitamins and minerals.

<HEADLINE> Campaign Finance Reform Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A prominent business group, defying the  
protests of a leading Senate Republican, says it expects support to 
grow for its effort to bring about changes in campaign spending 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Business backing for legislation to restrict the flood of  
company and union money into political campaigns could be 
influential when the House considers the bills this month, said 
Edward Kangas, an officer in the Committee for Economic 
Development. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am convinced, whether it is this fall or a year from now, we  
will have campaign finance reform because there is a revolt 
brewing,'' said Kangas, chairman of the accounting and consulting 
firm Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who heads fund-raising efforts for  
Senate GOP candidates, recently wrote business executives saying he 
was ``astonished to learn'' their companies were supporting the CED 
``in its all-out campaign to eviscerate private sector 
participation in politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said executives who disagree with the ``radical'' campaign  
finance agenda of the CED should resign from the nonpartisan public 
policy group that has promoted economic growth since 1942. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 executives and academics in the CED -- about half its  
membership -- have endorsed the group's recommendations for changing 
the laws, including by banning unregulated soft money donations to 
political parties. It also suggests increasing the ceiling for 
contributions by individuals, providing public matching funds and 
setting voluntary spending limits for House and Senate races. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't think that money is a bad thing, but we think it  
needs to be regulated and accounted for,'' said CED president 
Charles Kolb. 
</P>
<P>
	The CED, in a written response to McConnell, said ``we make no  
apologies'' for joining such groups as the League of Women Voters 
and the Sierra Club ``on an issue that they believe threatens the 
vitality of our participatory democracy.'' The CED's letter was 
first reported Sunday by The New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	McConnell and other GOP leaders argue that businesses, which  
tend to give more money to Republicans than Democrats, would see 
their power to influence public policy weakened if campaign 
spending were limited. 
</P>
<P>
	But some businesses have begun to balk at demands from the  
parties to finance increasingly expensive political campaigns. 
Several major corporations, including General Motors and Monsanto, 
resolved after the last presidential election to stop using 
corporate funds for soft money donations. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., a leading House advocate for  
campaign finance changes, said businesses ``are being shaken down 
for campaign contributions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the demands from the parties have grown from a few  
thousand dollars some years ago to hundreds of thousands of dollars 
now, and ``if you are not a player you are not always at the 
table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shays and Rep. Marty Meehan, D-Mass., are sponsors of a  
bipartisan bill that would ban soft money, increase disclosure 
requirements and restrict issue ads that seek to influence 
elections under the guise of educating voters. 
</P>
<P>
	It overcame fierce opposition from the GOP leadership to pass  
the House last fall, but its companion bill in the Senate, 
sponsored by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Russell Feingold, 
D-Wis., failed when it couldn't get the 60 votes needed to overcome 
a filibuster mounted by McConnell and others. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has promised another vote  
on campaign funding legislation shortly after Congress reconvenes 
next week.

	Albright Mediates Mideast Deadlock  
</P>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Egypt (AP) -- As prospects waned today for a West  
Bank agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, U.S. Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright stepped in to mediate. Until now, 
Albright had held back, believing the most successful agreements 
are the product of direct negotiations between the parties with 
minimal intervention. Albright telephoned Israeli Prime Minister 
Ehud Barak and met with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. The 
sticking point was a dispute over how many Palestinian prisoners 
Israel would release as a goodwill gesture. Albright has given no 
indication of how she might come down on the prisoners or other 
issues.

	Turkey Seeks Post-Quake Housing

<P>
	ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey's government split today over how  
to house more than half a million quake survivors, who are crowded 
into borrowed rooms, damaged buildings, tent cities and even docked 
ferries as winter approaches. Public Works Minister Koray Aydin 
insisted that the government could make good on its pledge to have 
50,000 prefabricated houses ready within two months. But critics 
argue that temporary houses would waste money that should be saved 
for rebuilding. They say it would be better to move quake victims 
into existing shelters for the winter -- hotels, public housing and 
elsewhere -- and provide rent assistance.

	FBI Source Confirms Waco Assault

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Audio from an infrared videotape picked up an  
agent's voice seeking and receiving permission from a commander to 
fire incendiary tear-gas grenades at a concrete bunker adjacent to 
the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas, an FBI source 
confirmed today. The source added that nothing on the videotape 
conflicts with the FBI's position that the tear gas did not ignite 
the blaze. Previously undisclosed evidence in the FBI's 1993 
assault on the compound has been impounded by federal marshals as 
Justice Department officials begin seeking an outsider to conduct a 
new investigation.

<P>
	WAVES, N.C. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Dennis meandered toward the  
North Carolina coast today, half the storm it was when it first 
spun into the Outer Banks. The fragile barrier islands were lashed 
by wind and 14-foot waves as crews struggled to deliver supplies to 
the stranded. President Clinton declared 50-mile-long Hatteras 
Island a disaster area and National Guard convoys ferried meals to 
the island. Yesterday, a land convoy delivering food discovered the 
island was effectively broken in two, as the storm had washed out 
highway N.C. 12. By today, winds had filled the gap with sand, 
enough of a fix to allow National Guard vehicles to cross.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army took the highly unusual action today  
of demoting a retired general who admitted during his court-martial 
last spring that he had adulterous affairs with the wives of four 
subordinates. Army Secretary Louis Caldera reduced the rank of 
David Hale from a two-star major general to a one-star brigadier 
general. Hale's current retirement pay of $6,250 a month will be 
reduced by about $750 a month. That cut is retroactive to his 
retirement date of March 1, 1998. Sen. Olympia J. Snowe, R-Maine, 
who urged Caldera to reduce Hale's rank, said she was pleased the 
Army secretary ``closed the Hale case on a high note of justice.''

	Bush: Don't Fund Bad Schools  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wading into the school voucher debate,  
Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush said today in Los 
Angeles, ``Federal money will no longer flow to failure.'' He said 
his administration would require states to test disadvantaged 
students, strip federal funds from the worst-scoring schools and 
allow private schools to get the public money. Though aides said 
Bush intentionally avoided the politically charged term ``school 
vouchers'' in an address that laid out his first education 
proposals for the 2000 campaign, his plan would pump federal money 
into private schools -- a concept Democrats say would hurt the

U.N. peacekeeping force into East Timor, apparently backing away 
from its earlier stance that it would provide security to the 
territory. The decision comes the same day two local U.N. staffers 
were killed in Maliana, 80 miles west of the territory's capital of 
Dili, which has been the scene of recent violence by 
anti-independence militias. The violence bring to four the number 
of local U.N. workers slain since Monday's independence referendum. 
Ballots are still being counted.

	Albright Mediates Mideast Deadlock  
</P>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Egypt (AP) -- As prospects waned Thursday for a West  
Bank agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, U.S. Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright stepped in to mediate. Until now, 
Albright had held back, believing the most successful agreements 
are the product of direct negotiations between the parties with 
minimal intervention. Albright telephoned Israeli Prime Minister 
Ehud Barak and met with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. The 
sticking point was a dispute over how many Palestinian prisoners 
Israel would release as a goodwill gesture. Albright has given no 
indication of how she might come down on the prisoners or other 
issues.

	Measles May Be Wiped Out in U.S.  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Only 100 cases of measles were reported in the  
United States last year, the government said today. The number is 
the lowest on record and suggests the nation has all but stamped 
out the disease, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
said. All but 29 of those cases involved people who were infected 
in other countries. Measles still kills roughly 1 million people 
worldwide each year. About half of those deaths occur in central 
Africa.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Sears, Roebuck and Co.'s stock plummeted 12  
percent today after the nation's second-largest retailer warned 
Wall Street that its third-quarter earnings would fall below 
expectations and announced a management shakeup. Sears, still mired 
in a slump despite a series of changes aimed at reviving its 
business, disclosed the news as it reported disappointing sales for 
the month of August. Shares in Sears closed down 3 11/16 at 33 1/2.

industrial average closed down 94.67 at 10,843.21, having worked 
its way back from a loss of 205 points earlier in the session. On

<HEADLINE> Driver Wants To Apologize to Author </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRYEBURG, Maine (AP) -- The driver whose van injured Stephen King  
as he was walking alongside a road said he would like to apologize 
to the author face-to-face. 
</P>
<P>
	The horror writer is recuperating after six operations to repair  
broken bones and a collapsed lung from the June 19 accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got distracted,'' Bryan Smith said in Wednesday's Bangor  
Daily News. ``It was one time, and one time only. I'm very, very 
sorry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he suffers from depression over the accident. He said  
he went off the road while trying to control his dog. A grand jury 
convenes Sept. 30 to decide whether charges should be filed against 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	King said he has no intention of suing Smith but wants his  
driver's license revoked. Smith's driving record includes four 
speeding violations, operating under the influence and driving to 
endanger. But he insisted he's not dangerous, as King has claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe 15 years ago he could say that. Fifteen? Twenty? Yes. I  
was dangerous,'' Smith said.

<HEADLINE> Court OKs Harlem Youth March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal appeals court has upheld a decision  
allowing the Million Youth March to go forward in Harlem this 
weekend, even going so far as to warn the city not to police the 
rally with ``undue rigidity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who insists the event is a thinly  
disguised hate march, was furious with the ruling, saying the 
judges ``have the luxury of keeping their heads in the sand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank goodness they don't have to govern a city because things  
would be really dangerous,'' he said Wednesday after the 2nd U.S. 
Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the city's challenge of a lower 
court order. 
</P>
<P>
	Rally organizers said the event, which they estimate will draw  
20,000, would focus on opportunities for black and Latino youths to 
make a better world by educating themselves and challenging their 
government to act fairly and responsibly to everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Hess, a lawyer for the city, said recent statements by  
rally organizers made it clear the group intends to seek violence, 
even bringing in gangs to help it succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a unique event, the only I've seen preaching hate,  
violence and death,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the court sided with organizers, finding they had a First  
Amendment right to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-judge panel warned the Police Department not to patrol  
the event with ``undue rigidity,'' and said forceful action should 
be taken only if the crowd does not disperse after the deadline of 
4 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, 28 people were injured, including 16 police officers,  
when chairs and bricks were hurled as an army of officers moved in 
to shut down the rally one minute after the 4 p.m. deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of black elected officials in Harlem have urged people  
to stay away from the rally, centered at 118th Street and Malcolm X 
Boulevard.

<HEADLINE> Pork King Murphy To Sell Farms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- The nation's two largest hog growers  
announced a $290 million merger Thursday, a shakeout from last 
year's rock-bottom producer pork prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Smithfield Foods Inc., of Smithfield, Va., the world's largest  
hog producer and processor, agreed to buy No. 2 producer Murphy 
Family Farms of Rose Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase involves about 10 million shares of Smithfield  
Foods plus the assumption of about $170 million in Murphy Farms 
debt and other liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy Family Farms, which specializes in raising hogs under  
contracts with independent farmers, struggled in the past year as 
pork prices hit the lowest prices in decades, said Kelly Zering, a 
North Carolina State University professor of agricultural resource 
economics. 
</P>
<P>
	Founder and chief executive officer Wendell H. Murphy signed a  
letter of intent Wednesday to sell his family-owned company to 
Smithfield, effective Jan. 1. Forbes magazine ranked it No. 355 on 
its 1998 list of privately held companies, with an estimated $650 
million in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Smithfield Foods, with $3.77 billion in sales for the year ended  
in April, will control 60 percent of the merged business operations 
from research and raising hogs to processing and distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	``Murphy Farms for some time has been analyzing the need for an  
alliance with a food processor to ensure stability for the Murphy 
family, the growers and the employees,'' said Lois Britt, a vice 
president and spokeswoman for Murphy Family Farms. 
</P>
<P>
	No layoffs are anticipated, and Wendell Murphy's future role in  
the merged companies has not yet been determined, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Low pork prices led the government to send hog producers at  
least $175 million in aid last year. Producer prices have since 
rebounded, with hog farmers getting 46 cents a pound again. 
</P>
<P>
	Smithfield Foods, which sends about 5.5 million hogs to market  
annually, raises hogs in North Carolina, South Carolina, Colorado, 
Virginia and Utah. A subsidiary, Carroll's Foods Inc., also 
produces hogs in Brazil and Mexico. Its products also are sold in 
Japan and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined pork giant would control about 15 percent of the  
hogs on U.S. farms, giving Smithfield Foods less impact on pork 
prices than Tyson Foods Inc. in chicken or IBP Inc. in beef, said 
Grimes and analyst George Shipp.

<HEADLINE> Student Said ``Bullied'' Into Suicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREEBURG, Ill. (AP) -- A 14-year-old who was just four days into  
his freshman year in high school committed suicide after being 
tormented by bullies, his father said. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Rudy killed himself with a shotgun last week in the  
basement of his parents' home. His father, Earl Rudy, said his son 
had been tormented for ``four days straight'' by other students 
before the suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was always a happy son, always friendly to people,'' Rudy  
said. ``He tried to be friendly to kids that didn't have any 
friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	High school administrators were interviewing Andrew's classmates  
Wednesday to determine who may have been involved in the 
harassment. Police said they've found evidence of verbal 
harassment, but no criminal acts. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we find that there was any criminal act committed, than we  
are certainly going to go for charges,'' said Chief of Police Steve 
Flater. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew's father said his son's tormentors had forced him into a  
locker and demanded he utter demeaning remarks. But school 
officials said no one witnessed such an incident. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials said they are focusing on a small number of  
students. 
</P>
<P>
	``I lost such a good son,'' said Rudy. ``I don't want anyone  
else to go through what we're going through.''

<HEADLINE> Retail Money Funds Rise / Money Market Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's retail money market  
mutual funds rose by $947.8 million in the latest week to $889.82 
billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category rose  
by $975.7 million to $738.89 billion for the week ended Wednesday, 
the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. Tax-exempt fund 
assets fell by $27.9 million to $150.93 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of institutional money market funds fell by $5.88 billion  
to $597.43 billion for the same period. Among institutional funds, 
taxable money market fund assets fell by $5.64 billion to $549.34 
billion; assets of tax-exempt funds fell by $236.0 million to 
$48.09 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Total money market assets stood at $1.487 trillion for the week.  
</P>
<P>
	Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.492 trillion to  
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in  
the week ended Tuesday to 4.64 percent from 4.53 percent the 
previous week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal 
published in Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial Data Inc. The 30-day 
average yield rose to 4.55 percent from 4.51 percent, IBC Financial 
Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day compounded yield rose to 4.75 percent from 4.64  
percent the previous week, and the 30-day compounded yield rose to 
4.65 percent from 4.61 percent, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was  
56 days, unchanged from the previous week, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The online service bankrate.com said its survey of 100 leading  
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks 
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the annual percentage 
yield available on money market accounts fell to 2.06 percent as of 
Wednesday from 2.07 percent a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based unit of Intelligent Life Corp.  
said the annual percentage yield available on interest-bearing 
checking accounts fell to 0.83 percent from 0.84 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankrate.com said the annual percentage yield was 4.30 percent  
on six-month certificates of deposit, unchanged from the previous 
week. Yields were 4.68 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 4.66 percent; 
4.96 percent on 2 1/2-year CDs, up from 4.95 percent; and 5.19 percent 
on 5-year CDs, up from 5.16 percent.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Claims Rise by 4,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans filing new claims for  
unemployment benefits inched up last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported today that 289,000 Americans filed  
new claims for jobless benefits for the week ending Aug. 28, up by 
4,000 from the previous week. That was the highest since Aug. 14, 
when claims matched last week's level. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-week moving average for claims, which smooths out  
week-to-week volatility, was up to 286,500 last week. That was the 
highest level since Aug. 7, when claims were at 288,250. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week's increase in new claims was in line with many  
economists' expectations. Economists consider jobless claims levels 
below 300,000 an indication of an extremely tight labor market. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists expect the nation's unemployment rate -- now at  
4.3 percent -- will return to a 29-year low of 4.2 percent when the 
government releases its August unemployment report Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The results are expected to offer an important clue as to  
whether the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates again when 
it meets in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Fed bumped up interest rates for the second time  
this year but signaled that no additional increases may be 
necessary unless the economy shows signs of overheating or if 
inflation flares. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said today that for the week ending Aug.  
21, 14 states and territories reported increases in new jobless 
claims, while 39 reported decreases. The state data lag a week 
behind the national figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The state with the biggest increase in applications for jobless  
benefits was Georgia, up 1,538. Officials blamed the increase on 
layoffs in the textile industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states with increases were: South Carolina, up 659; New  
York, up 333; New Mexico, up 157; and Missouri, up 131. 
</P>
<P>
	The state with the biggest decrease in jobless benefits claims  
was Michigan, down 1,642. Officials didn't offer a reason for the 
decline. Other states with decreases were: North Carolina, down 
1,231; California, down 947; Pennsylvania, down 916; and Puerto 
Rico, down 764.

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Lashes N.C. Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WAVES, N.C. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Dennis meandered toward the  
North Carolina coast today, half the storm it was when it first 
spun into the Outer Banks but still making life hard for about 
5,000 people on the eve of Labor Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The fragile barrier islands were lashed by wind and 14-foot  
waves as crews struggled to deliver supplies to the stranded. The 
storm's maximum sustained wind speed was 60 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton declared 50-mile-long Hatteras Island a  
disaster area and National Guard convoys ferried meals to the 
island. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, a land convoy delivering food discovered the  
island was effectively broken in two, as the storm had washed out 
highway N.C. 12 and created a trench across a quarter-mile neck 
between Avon and Buxton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Between Avon and Buxton, it's completely washed out,'' Sgt.  
Joe Baker of the National Guard said Wednesday after his convoy was 
forced to turn back. 
</P>
<P>
	By today, the action of the winds had filled the gap with sand,  
enough of a fix to allow National Guard vehicles to cross. The road 
remained closed to regular drivers, although crews expected to get 
the section of highway north of the torn-up stretch to be reopened 
to limited traffic later today. 
</P>
<P>
	Power was restored today to all but 500 of Hatteras Island's  
5,000 or more permanent residents. Telephone service remained out 
but ferry service also resumed to Hatteras Island and Ocracoke 
Island, where about 700 people have been isolated since Dennis 
struck Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	About 5,000 people, mostly residents, stayed on Hatteras after  
officials ordered an evacuation Sunday, then were stuck when the 
island's only north-south highway became impassable. Dennis headed 
into the Atlantic on Monday, but then began backtracking, forcing a 
second evacuation order on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A ferry loaded with heavy equipment immediately left Cedar  
Island for Ocracoke Island to begin work clearing roads there, said 
Richard Moore, secretary of crime control and public safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore said parts of N.C. 12 were in terrible shape.  
</P>
<P>
	``For over a mile, you don't see any blacktop. There is some  
debate whether there is a roadbed there or not,'' he said. ``It's 
beyond the crisis stage. There are places where there are no dunes 
at all and if you try to just throw blacktop down, you're throwing 
your money away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere on the Outer Banks, at least three cars were buried in  
sand up to their door handles in Nags Head. One cottage collapsed 
at Kitty Hawk and five were reported destroyed at Rodanthe on 
Hatteras Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine coastal counties also were issued with federal disaster  
declarations Wednesday, meaning the government will cover 75 
percent of the cost of relief efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Blaes of the National Weather Service in Raleigh said  
today there was a slight chance Dennis could reintensify, but it 
probably would continue to slowly drift to the west and southwest 
for the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is just kind of wobbling around,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. today, Dennis was drifting slowly to the southwest,  
100 miles east of Cape Hatteras, still lashing the barrier islands 
with gusty wind and high waves. It was expected to continue moving 
slowly through tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	A tropical storm warning was in effect from Cape Lookout, N.C.,  
to Cape Charles Light, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 120,000 to 150,000 people live along North  
Carolina's 320-mile coast, and the summer tourist influx swells the 
population to about half a million. 
</P>
<P>
	When Dennis brushed by the Outer Banks the first time,  
vacationers and residents were ordered to evacuate. Some returned 
when Dennis headed into the Atlantic, only to have to leave again 
when the storm returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Kinchner of Dover, Del., was one of the Nags Head  
vacationers who tried to stay. On Wednesday, he was packing up, 
strapping a grill, cooler and fishing rods to a rack on his sport 
utility vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were hoping to stick it out,'' he said, ``but it's  
futile.''

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eugene Ostroff, longtime curator of  
photography at the National Museum of American History, is dead of 
cancer at age 71. 
</P>
<P>
	He died last month at Sibley Memorial Hospital.  
</P>
<P>
	Ostroff retired in 1994 after 34 years with the Smithsonian  
Institution. He was credited with opening the museum's Hall of 
Photography in 1972 and organizing a number of special exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
	After joining the Smithsonian in 1960, he pursued research into  
the history of photography and published his findings, mostly in 
technical and scientific periodicals. 
</P>
<P>
	He later consulted with museums around the world on standards  
for storing and displaying old photographs. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife of four years and three children from  
his first marriage, which ended in divorce.

	Thunderstorms dampened parts of the Gulf Coast and West on  
Thursday, while Tropical Storm Dennis churned wind and rain as it 
stayed parked off the coast of North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis sent light showers into Virginia and North Carolina.  
Heavier precipitation came from a disturbance along the Gulf Coast

Mississippi and Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	Showers and thundershowers were widespread from Minnesota south

</P>
<P>
	The rest of the West, from Washington down to California, was  
fair and dry. Similar conditions prevailed from the Great Lakes and 
Northeast south into the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, because of

<HEADLINE> Primate Lab Giving Up 300 Chimps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A major primate research laboratory accused of  
mistreating its 650 chimpanzees is being forced to give up 300 of 
the animals and improve its staff and facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a settlement announced Wednesday by the Agriculture  
Department, The Coulston Foundation of Alamogordo, N.M., agreed to 
undergo review by a panel of experts and will be barred from 
acquiring any additional chimps without government approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an unprecedented consent agreement and a big win for  
these magnificent animals,'' said Michael Dunn, USDA's 
undersecretary for marketing and regulatory programs. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA listed 22 violations of a federal animal welfare law,  
including the case of a chimpanzee named ``Echo'' in which lab 
personnel ``undertook an extensive surgical procedure under 
inappropriate conditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three other animals died unnecessarily because the lab staff was  
unaware of the side effects and complications of pharmaceutical 
compounds that were administered, USDA said. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspectors also said the lab's housing was inadequate, lacking  
among other things a proper system for disposing of animal and food 
wastes. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to the lab late Wednesday were not answered. Coulston  
spokesman Don McKinney was out of town and unreachable for comment 
late Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Animal rights activists have been complaining about Coulston for  
years, accusing the lab of negligence in the death of several 
chimps. In 1996, without admitting wrongdoing, Coulston settled 
USDA allegations of animal care violations that occurred in 1993 
when three chimps died. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stunning terms of this settlement are truly unparalleled  
in the history of the Animal Welfare Act,'' said Elliot Katz, 
president of In Defense of Animals, an animal-rights group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never before has a research laboratory been forced to  
surrender almost half its animals, essentially stop acquiring and 
breeding chimpanzees for years, and submit to both outside animal 
care monitoring as well as an independent compliance official,'' 
Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
	In agreeing to the settlement, Coulston did not admit to any  
violations. But the foundation will have to pay a $100,000 fine if 
it fails to comply with the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The lab must place 150 of its animals by the end of next year  
and the remaining 150 by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the Air Force announced that it was giving 111 of its  
research chimpanzees to Coulston, which has operated an Air Force 
research primate facility at Holloman Air Force Base near 
Alamogordo since 1993. Company officials said the animals would be 
used for breeding and for research into Alzheimer's disease, 
diabetes and arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, the Air Force said Coulston ``did as well or better  
than the other chimpanzee facilities in the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the Department of Health and Human Services  
put restrictions on the lab's handling of animals used in 
agency-sponsored projects. Among other things, the lab was required 
to file quarterly reports on its efforts to find appropriate staff.

<HEADLINE> Wake Forest Track Coach Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- John Goodridge, men's track and cross  
country coach at Wake Forest for 15 years, resigned Thursday in 
protest of the firing of his wife, women's coach Francie Goodridge. 
</P>
<P>
	John Goodridge announced his resignation after his wife,  
Francie, a two-time Olympian, was fired over the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodridge alleged in a letter to reporters that his wife was  
fired in retaliation for complaining that Wake Forest wasn't doing 
enough to resolve Title IX issues, such as medical and safety 
concerns, scholarships and staffing. Title IX guarantees equality 
in men's and women's athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodridge said athletic director Ron Wellman also retaliated  
against the men's team by not giving it the full complement of NCAA 
allowable scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
	Wake Forest officials didn't immediately return calls seeking  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Francie has remained silent over her firing for fear of  
further harsher retaliation by Wellman against me and my program 
... and I simply can no longer dedicate my love for my sport and my 
efforts to this program,'' Goodridge said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodridge said Wellman fired Francie Goodridge over student  
complaints, but that action ``was a completely transparent, 
attempted cover-up for a planned agenda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodridge wasn't clear in his statement whether he and his wife  
would file a lawsuit, but said, ``That real agenda will be revealed 
in the legal process to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The women's cross country team ranked as high as sixth  
nationally under Francie Goodridge, who competed in the 1968 and 
1972 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's cross country team won four Atlantic Coast Conference  
championships, and John Goodridge was named ACC coach of the year 
six times.

circulations and sales promotions,'' she wrote.

	``I shared her, not always joyfully, with the world when she was  
alive. I'm possessive, since her death, of her and of what I see to 
be the interests of her `blood' family.''

<HEADLINE> Clintons Sign Deal for N.Y. House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. (AP) -- It's the American Dream: After years of  
living in public housing, President Clinton and Hillary Rodham 
Clinton have found a home of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons have signed a contract to purchase a $1.7 million  
house in this quiet Westchester County hamlet. The decision, 
announced Thursday, ended a months-long guessing game over where 
the Clintons finally would put down their post-White House roots, 
while providing the residency Mrs. Clinton would need to run for 
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The president and first lady will close on the house Nov. 1, and  
a White House spokesman said they planned to spend plenty of time 
in the white, three-story wood frame house -- a prospect that was 
greeted with a mixture of dread and delight by some of their 
neighbors-to-be. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Clintons will continue to live in the White House,'' Joe  
Lockhart said. ``As with other presidents, this house will be their 
private home and they will spend as much time there as they can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said the Clintons will borrow $1.3 million from Bankers  
Trust Co. to make the purchase. The loan will be guaranteed in part 
by Terry McAuliffe, the president's friend and one of his chief 
fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just proud that as of today, Bill Clinton and I are the  
newest homeowners of the state of New York,'' Mrs. Clinton said at 
a fund-raiser Thursday night in Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
	The house was built in 1889 and features a swimming pool, five  
bedrooms, four bathrooms and two fireplaces. The top floor contains 
an exercise room. The lot, just over an acre, is screened by 
evergreens at the end of a cul-de-sac. 
</P>
<P>
	At $1.7 million, the Clintons agreed to pay slightly more than  
the list price of $1.695 million for the house. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons, who earned $504,109 last year, will pay about  
$26,000 a year in property taxes on their new residence, according 
to tax records. This should prove to be a relatively novel 
experience for the Clintons, who have lived in public housing for 
18 of the past 20 years -- for 12 years when Clinton was governor of 
Arkansas and the past six as president. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the mortgage, McAuliffe -- a close friend of the  
president and his chief campaign fund-raiser -- will put up $1.35 
million of his own money as collateral. The Clintons will make a 
down payment of $350,000, drawing on money from the blind trust 
established at the start of their presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents were of mixed minds about the new celebrity status  
sure to attach to this small community when the Clintons move to 
the house on Old House Lane. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Clintons will bring a little bit of excitement,''  
John Priscantelli, who said he lives about half a mile from the 
Clintons' future home. ``I think it's going to add some charm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zyrafete Osmani, whose family has lived on Old House Lane for 12  
years, said she did not mind the sudden influx of media and 
gawkers. ``It's been too quiet around here,'' she said. ``When we 
first moved in it was like a desert.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Osmani, who is a Kosovar Albanian, added that Clinton ``did  
so much for our country. We could never have enough words to thank 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a disaster,'' said Carol Thorsen, whose home is separated  
from the one the Clintons have picked by a wooded area. ``This town 
is too small. This is going to destroy the intimacy of the town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others said the Clintons' residence would depend on Mrs.  
Clinton's political life. She hasn't declared her candidacy for the 
Senate seat being vacated by Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan, but it is widely presumed she will run. The couple has 
been spending their vacation fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
	``If she wins, she'll move in,'' Susan Spar, 30, said of Mrs.  
Clinton as she ate dinner in Chappaqua's downtown area. ``If not, 
maybe they'll sell the house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chappaqua, part of the town of New Castle, was originally  
settled by Quakers in the mid-1700s, said town historian Richard 
Neale. 
</P>
<P>
	To this day, the hamlet is mostly residential and there are few  
multiple-family dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
	Neale said he thought the Clintons will like living in  
Chappaqua. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only problem is, is the site they picked big enough to  
handle the operation?'' he asked. ``It's next to a main road, a 
handsome house but by no means a mansion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons' purchase of a home in New York won't sever their  
ties to their home state since the president will spend 
considerable time in Arkansas when he leaves office, developing his 
presidential library.

<HEADLINE> Minnesota Hit With Another Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Minnesota settled a sexual harassment claim  
against Rufus Simmons in 1988, five years before he was put in 
charge of sexual harassment and violence awareness training for 
athletes, the Star Tribune reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	University president Mark Yudof said he was ``astounded and  
deeply concerned'' to learn about the claim, and that officials 
will investigate whether administrators knew about it when Simmons 
was made director of the Center for Student-Athlete Development. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinley Boston, vice president of student development and  
athletics, said he was unaware of the claim until the Star Tribune 
inquired about it. Boston, who came to the university as men's 
athletic director in 1991, put Simmons in charge of the center in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Before he became director of the center, Simmons had pleaded  
guilty in 1991 to soliciting prostitution. He was arrested and 
cited for the same offense this past June, a month and a half 
before he retired. On Tuesday, Simmons pleaded not guilty to the 
most recent citation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not doing me or my family any good,'' Simmons said  
Wednesday on the porch of his home in Bloomington. 
</P>
<P>
	He wouldn't address concerns that his prostitution citations and  
the harassment allegation may have affected his credibility, given 
his responsibilities in the men's athletics department. 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof, who came to the university in 1997, expressed strong  
feelings about the 1988 sexual harassment claim. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's totally inappropriate, totally inappropriate, to have a  
person like this, even with the allegations, whether they're true 
or not -- I don't know whether they're true or not -- in a position 
where you're coordinating training programs in terms of sexual 
awareness,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Envoy to IMF Abruptly Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's envoy to the International Monetary Fund  
abruptly quit Thursday, but insisted the decision was unconnected 
to reports that IMF aid to Russia may have been illegally diverted 
through the Bank of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Mikhail Zadornov said all IMF money had been spent properly, and  
that he was resigning to run for parliament in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The move came amid concerns that the IMF may delay new loans to  
Russia over the scandal. The U.S. government -- the IMF's largest 
member -- said it won't decide whether to approve new loans until a 
full accounting is made of the IMF money Russia has already 
received. 
</P>
<P>
	News reports have said U.S. investigators believe Russian  
organized crime and others laundered billions of dollars through 
the Bank of New York. Some reports have suggested that IMF money 
may have been diverted in the transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has been charged in the matter, but on Thursday the Bank  
of New York dismissed a second employee in connection with the 
scandal. A source close to the matter said Svetlana Kudryavtsev, an 
associate in the bank's Eastern European division, was fired for 
failing to cooperate with an internal probe. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank had already fired Lucy Edwards, a London-based vice  
president, last Friday for gross misconduct, violation of the 
bank's internal policies, falsification of banks records and 
failure to cooperate with the bank's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	In Moscow, Zadornov insisted that IMF aid wasn't mishandled, he  
urged Russian officials to ``take an active role'' in the Bank of 
New York investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian government has said little about the money  
laundering case. Prosecutors said they are looking into the 
reports, but no formal investigation has been launched. Russian 
organized crime has close ties with some officials and corruption 
is endemic in the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Some officials have reacted with nationalist indignation to the  
allegations reported in Western media. Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov 
said Wednesday the scandal was part of a deliberate policy by 
``certain circles who don't want Russia to reassert its role as a 
great power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russian newspapers took the same line on Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	``McCarthyism lives. And its cause forges ahead,'' the  
influential daily Kommersant proclaimed in a front-page headline. 
</P>
<P>
	It went on: ``Only recently the term `Soviet threat' went out of  
the West's political vocabulary ... To replace the `Soviet threat,' 
came `Russian mafia.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The popular daily Izvestia noted that ``the West, for some  
unknown reason, has started missing the times of the Cold War and 
the Iron Curtain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russian media have also linked the affair to presidential  
campaigning in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The reaction reflects the recent decline in relations between  
the United States and Russia. The two nations clashed over the 
Kosovo conflict and the tone from Moscow is increasingly 
nationalistic, a stance welcomed by many Russians nostalgic for the 
days of Soviet superpower status. 
</P>
<P>
	Zadornov, meanwhile, played down his departure, saying it  
shouldn't harm Russia's relations with the IMF. He predicted the 
next scheduled loan would come as scheduled later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is the IMF's biggest borrower, with about $20 billion in  
lending since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	A long-time member of the Russian Cabinet, Zadornov said he was  
resigning to run for parliament as a candidate of the liberal 
Yabloko party, which has a reputation for honesty in Russia's often 
corrupt politics. 
</P>
<P>
	President Boris Yeltsin, who must approve the resignation and  
appoint a successor, did not immediately respond. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have succeeded in fully renewing our relations with  
international financial institutions,'' Zadornov told a news 
conference. ``I consider my mission fulfilled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zadornov helped negotiate the resumption of IMF aid to Moscow  
this July after it was frozen in the wake of Russia's financial 
meltdown last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF was expected to release a $640 million installment of a  
$4.5 billion loan package this month. An IMF mission is currently 
in Moscow to review Russia's compliance with conditions for the 
package. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian ruble fell against the U.S. dollar for a third day  
Thursday amid concerns that the IMF loan would be delayed. One 
dollar bought 25.79 rubles on the Moscow Interbank Currency 
Exchange, up from 25.4 rubles the day before.

<HEADLINE> Teacher Strike Continues in Detroit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- With three children left idle as a teachers  
strike grinds into its third day, 27-year-old Angela Banks worries 
about what will happen next week. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Ms. Banks has been tutoring her children on her own.  
But what if teachers don't return to work before she must go back 
to her own job at the county court? 
</P>
<P>
	``I had it together until they went on strike,'' she said  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Banks' dilemma was replicated across the city as affected  
parents looked into charter, private and parochial schools for ways 
to get their kids out of the house and into the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Tinene Myers, whose 7-year-old daughter is handicapped and  
entering the second grade, said: ``I had planned on going back to 
school so this is putting a hold on my plans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teachers union, which represents about 9,200 classroom  
teachers, voted Monday to reject a 10-day contract extension 
recommended by a reform school board appointed last spring by Mayor 
Dennis Archer. 
</P>
<P>
	The teachers went on strike Tuesday on what should have been the  
first day of classes in the 172,000-student district. Talks ended 
late Wednesday without a breakthrough. Classes were not expected to 
be held today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say that anybody is wildly optimistic, but the number  
of issues is relatively small,'' David Adamany, the district's 
interim schools chief, said Wednesday. ``I think we're all hopeful 
we can close the gap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The main sticking points include the administration's merit pay  
proposal, a crackdown on teacher absenteeism, class size and the 
salary schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody wants change in the Detroit schools more than the  
teachers,'' Mark O'Keefe, a third-grade teacher, said. ``The time 
is right for reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Belle Isle Zoo -- offering free admission to all school  
kids during the strike -- security guard Alice Louis said she 
supports the teachers who have coped with overcrowding and 
shortages of supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	``The teachers have been there and done that. They deal with  
kids. They have to be the childrens' mother and father -- like 
second parents,'' said Ms. Louis, who has two kids in Detroit 
schools. ``The only thing they're asking for is a contract, and 
they deserve it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodericus Rayford, 33, also supports the educators. But while  
nine of his nieces, nephews, children and neighbors crowded his 
front porch, he also said he hoped they get back to work soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Otherwise, I'll get some signs for the kids, and we'll all go  
picket out there with them saying, `We want to go back!''' Rayford 
said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-year-old Quaashie Haten, who spent the day at a public  
playground and zoo with his brothers and mother, also wants to go 
back. ``I wanted to go to school,'' the second-grader confessed. 
</P>
<P>
	For parents looking for activities for their children, People's  
Community Services reopened three summer programs which had closed 
a week ago, associate director Lynne Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Adams-Butzel Recreation Center, supervisor Alton Darden  
said summer employees had to be called back to help open the center 
four hours earlier than usual. 
</P>
<P>
	And about 130 local students were signed up Wednesday to start  
school in neighboring Highland Park, which has opened its doors to 
students outside its boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
	While parents scampered to find something for their kids to do,  
there was growing evidence that patience with the strike -- the 
fourth by Detroit teachers since 1982 -- was wearing thin. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need their money like I need my money because they have  
kids to feed, too,'' said waitress Carolyn Norman, 38, whose 
daughter's senior year at Martin Luther King Jr. High School has 
been delayed. ``I'll give them until Labor Day. Then I'm going to 
have problems.''

<HEADLINE> Phiilippine Phone Changes Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- The Philippines is considering  
setting up zones for companies specializing in electronic commerce 
which would let them use competitive international telephone rates, 
the government's top economic planner said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The only option currently available to many businesses is the  
international services of Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co., 
the country's dominant telephone company. Critics say these 
services are expensive and sometimes not up to par. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary for Socio-Economic Planning Felipe Medalla said the  
zones would be like the free ports that have already boosted 
foreign investment in areas like the former U.S. naval base at 
Subic Bay. Only this time, businesses will get access to cheaper 
international telephone rates rather than access to tax-free 
imports. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to create virtual free ports, and what's free is the  
freedom of choice,'' Medalla said. ``We are looking at it now, but 
what we have to do is make sure that companies aren't selling these 
services (to other telephone users) at standard rates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A growing number of electronic commerce and Internet-related  
companies are starting up in the Philippines, encouraged by the 
country's English-proficient workforce and the country's proximity 
to the biggest regional market, China. 
</P>
<P>
	Major international companies like America Online and Anderson  
Consulting have also been shifting their back office operations to 
the Philippines, and Medalla sees this as a potential driver of the 
Philippine economy in the years to come. 
</P>
<P>
	Many businesses, though, have to rely on Internet servers based  
in other countries. The Philippines has been trying to modernize 
its telecommunications industry for some time, but has been 
handicapped by a constitutional curb on foreign ownership of 40 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	President Joseph Estrada is advocating constitutional revisions  
to allow greater foreign investment, but the process could take 
over two years. 
</P>

	More FBI-Waco Evidence Is Found  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More previously undisclosed video footage of  
the FBI's 1993 tear-gas assault on the Branch Davidian cult 
surfaced today. The FBI made public an aerial infrared videotape 
that runs from just before 6 a.m. to 8 a.m. on April 19, 1993 -- 
covering the period during which the FBI assault on the Davidian 
compound began and capturing radio traffic related to the use of 
combustible tear gas canisters. The FBI and Attorney General Janet 
Reno, who have been heavily criticized over the Waco assault, have 
said there was no evidence to suggest the blaze was set by the 
combustible canisters.

	Albright Mediates Mideast Deadlock  
</P>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Egypt (AP) -- A negotiating deadlock Thursday forced  
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to mediate details of a West 
Bank agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. The sticking 
point was a dispute over how many Palestinian prisoners Israel 
would release as a goodwill gesture to Palestinian leader Yasser 
Arafat. Some are in jail for terrorist acts. Until now, Albright 
had held back, operating on the assumption the most successful 
agreements are the product of direct negotiations between the 
parties with minimal outside intervention.

	Islamic Group Claims Moscow Bombing  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- A previously unknown Islamic fundamentalist group  
claimed responsibility Thursday for the bombing this week of an 
upscale shopping mall near the Kremlin in which 41 people were 
injured. The claim, made by telephone, said the bombing was 
connected to fighting between Russian troops and Islamic militants 
in the southern republic of Dagestan. But some officials dismissed 
the claim as a hoax. A man who claimed to be a leader of the 
Islamic Army for the Liberation of Dagestan called journalists 
Thursday to say his organization was responsible for the blast.

	Drop in Alcohol-Linked Road Deaths  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The number of alcohol-related traffic fatalities  
in the United States dropped to 15,935 last year, the lowest level 
in the 17 years the government has been keeping the statistic. The 
figure dropped 1.5 percent from the year before, when alcohol was 
involved in 16,189 crash deaths, federal officials said today. 
President Clinton said the number of young people killed in 
alcohol-related crashes also dropped to a record low -- to nine per 
100,000, from 10 per 100,000.

	Vitamins Might Ward Off Toxemia  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Women at high risk for toxemia, one of the most  
dangerous complications of pregnancy, might avoid the condition by 
taking vitamin C and E pills, new research suggests. Toxemia, which 
occurs in about 5 percent of pregnancies, is a potentially fatal 
condition in which blood vessels throughout the body and womb 
constrict, reducing the amount of the mother's blood that reaches 
the fetus. The British scientists who conducted the study warned 
that pregnant women should not rush to start taking large doses of 
the vitamins, since the findings are preliminary.

	Aetna To Cover New Pap Test  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Aetna Inc., the nation's largest health insurer,  
reversed itself today and agreed to cover a new type of Pap smear 
test. Federal officials in 1996 said the test was more effective in 
detecting early signs of cervical cancer. Last year, a top Aetna 
official said the ThinPrep PapTest would add $1 billion to health 
care costs nationwide without any proof that it is better than the 
conventional Pap smear test at saving live. But today, Aetna said 
new, as yet unpublished studies show ThinPrep increases the 
detection of abnormal or precancerous cells.

points earlier in the session. On the NYSE, decliners led advancers 
2,084-840. The Nasdaq was down 16.56 at 2,734.24.

	Agassi Zoning in at U.S. Open  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Andre Agassi today demolished qualifier Axel  
Pretzsch of Germany, 6-3, 6-2, 6-1 to reach the third round of the 
U.S. Open. Agassi has been on a roll all summer, from his triumph 
at the French Open to the final of Wimbledon to the title he won 
two weeks ago in Washington. On the women's side, No. 3 Venus 
Williams gained a walkover into the fourth round when her scheduled 
opponent for tomorrow withdrew because of a strained right wrist. 
Her sister, Serena also advanced, as did No. 4 Monica Seles.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Move Lower / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures opened slightly lower today on  
the Chicago Board of Trade after two days of solid advances. Grain 
futures also retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean prices later turned higher, buoyed by U.S. Department of  
Agriculture figures showing export sales higher than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the week ending Aug. 26 were 531,400 tons, the report  
said -- on the high side of what analysts had anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	Any gains were expected to be limited by nervousness ahead of  
crop production forecasts expected later in the day and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn prices also were buoyed by solid weekly export sales  
figures, turning higher after opening lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat opened slightly lower as investors responded to  
lower-than-expected weekly net export sales. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Forbes Wants Bush, Jeb Bush </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Steve Forbes is ready for Gov. Bush to  
join his White House bid -- Jeb Bush, that is. 
</P>
<P>
	The millionaire publisher has bought 19 Internet addresses on  
the long-shot chance that Florida Gov. Jeb Bush might consent to 
run as his vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Give Forbes points for cleverness,'' Jeb Bush spokesman Corey  
Tilley said. ``The governor laughed about it and shook his head 
when he heard about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the Internet sites the Forbes campaign has registered are  
www.steveandjeb.net, www.steveforbes-jebbush.com and 
www.forbesandgovernorjeb.com. None of the 19 domain names are 
currently active. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will always be room for a Bush on the Forbes ticket,''  
Forbes spokesman Kendrick Ashton said. ``It just happens to be Jeb 
Bush.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In May, the presidential campaign of Jeb's brother George W.  
Bush, governor of Texas, bought rights to Internet addresses 
teaming him with a host of potential vice presidential candidates, 
including New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman and New York Gov. George 
Pataki. 
</P>
<P>
	The Politics1 Report, an online political newsletter, discovered  
Wednesday that Forbes had fought back, by securing the rights to 
the address variations to a Forbes-Bush ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe Steve Forbes should check out our Web site at  
www.georgewbush.com,'' said George W. campaign spokeswoman Mindy 
Tucker. ``He will see that Jeb Bush and 22 other governors have 
endorsed George W. Bush for president.''

<HEADLINE> What Happened to Hot Toys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Every few years, there seems to be a must-have toy that people  
across the nation scramble to find. But what happens to these toys 
once the next ``big thing'' catches the consumer's eye? 
</P>
<P>
	Here is a list of some popular toys and where they are now.  

</P>
<P>
                          *Holiday Barbie    	
</P>
<P>
	Mattel Inc. launched the dressed-up dolls in 1988 and they were  
an immediate hit among both children and adult collectors. Mattel 
only issued one new Holiday Barbie every year in the three months 
before Christmas and limited the supply. In 1995 and 1996, it was 
one of the nation's best-selling dolls. But sales fell after that, 
amid an oversupply in the marketplace. The doll was discontinued 
this year. 

</P>
<P>
                         *Cabbage Patch Kids    	
</P>
<P>
	Cabbage Patch Kids were developed by art student Xavier Roberts  
in 1976. The Coleco toy company made a deal in 1982 to mass-produce 
the dolls, known for their cute faces and pudgy bodies. Each doll 
also came with a unique birth certificate. Nearly 3 million were 
made for the 1983 holiday season, but that was hardly enough to 
satisfy demand. Sales hit $4 billion within five years before 
leveling off, but the dolls, now made by Mattel, remain somewhat 
popular. Some of the original handmade versions command thousands 
of dollars from collectors. 

</P>
<P>
                           *Teddy Ruxpin    	
</P>
<P>
	Worlds of Wonder launched the talking bears in 1985. Consumers  
bought more than 7 million of the lip-syncing dolls in a few years 
time. But malfunctions with the bear's technology led to lots of 
toys being returned to the manufacturer. Worlds of Wonder filed for 
bankruptcy within two years of having the Christmas hit. Teddy 
Ruxpin was brought back in 1998 by Yes! Entertainment to little 
fanfare. In February, the company filed for Chapter 11 federal 
bankruptcy court protection. 

</P>
<P>
                             *Hula Hoop    	
</P>
<P>
	Wham-O introduced the Hula Hoop in 1958, based on a bamboo  
exercise hoop used in gym classes in Australian elementary schools. 
It only took a few months for sales to reach 25 million and after 
two years, the number surpassed 100 million. But sales slowed by 
the early 1960s. Hula Hoops, however, never went away for good; the 
plastic, circular rings are still found in most large toy stores.

<HEADLINE> NJ Mayor Loses Bid To Open Evidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- A week after federal investigators raided  
Mayor Milton Milan's office and home searching for ties to 
organized crime, a judge on Thursday refused the mayor's request to 
make public any evidence against him. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Magistrate Robert Kugler ruled against Milan and two  
newspapers -- The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Courier-Post of 
Cherry Hill -- who had sought release of documents related to the 
raid. 
</P>
<P>
	Milan, 36, is a former Marine and the first Latino mayor of  
Camden, the poorest city in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators last week executed search warrants at City Hall  
and Milan's home, carting away boxes of documents and materials. 
They have refused to say what they were seeking, or if Milan is a 
target. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have the FBI searching your bedroom at 7 in the  
morning, you're a target,'' said Edwin J. Jacobs, Milan's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents were seeking evidence of extortion, fraud, mail and tax  
fraud, conspiracy and interstate transportation in aid of 
racketeering, Jacobs said. 
</P>
<P>
	The warrants sought documents relating to jailed  
Philadelphia-South Jersey mob boss Ralph Natale, who was arrested 
in June on drug conspiracy charges. They also sought documents 
about 25 businesses and individuals, contractors, city employees 
and convicted drug dealers who pleaded guilty in a major cocaine 
ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs said there is no connection between Milan and Natale.  
Milan has declared his innocence, and has also rejected calls from 
critics for him to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no consideration whatsoever (of resigning). The  
people elected me to do a job and I am going to do that job ... 
till death do we part,'' Milan told the Inquirer and the 
Courier-Post. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the Inquirer reported that Daniel Daidone, a former  
Natale associate and driver, was the alleged bridge between Milan 
and Natale. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, the city had filed for bankruptcy, but averted the  
crisis when Milan agreed to give the state greater oversight of its 
finances. 
</P>
<P>
	Milan's attorney and the newspapers sought the affidavit  
outlining the probable cause for the search warrants and the 
inventory of what investigators seized. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfair to float all the rumors and not let the public  
know the facts,'' Jacobs said. ``We want the entire story known 
now, not six months from now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Renee M. Bumb told the judge that  
unsealing the documents would compromise the investigation. The 
government is also trying to protect the names of witnesses 
cooperating with their investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Kugler said releasing the documents would disclose the scope and  
the focus of the case. The documents will be made public, if and 
when an indictment is returned, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Milan sued the Inquirer after it ran an article weeks  
before the mayoral election identifying him as a suspect in a 
9-year-old murder case. He later dropped the suit.

<HEADLINE> August Retail Sales Mostly Strong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Retailers enjoyed another strong month in  
August, as Americans shrugged off rising interest rates and 
turbulence on Wall Street and kept buying at the nation's stores 
and malls. 
</P>
<P>
	But a few hints of weakness amid the sales reports issued  
Thursday raised some concerns over the outlook for consumer 
spending in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have a picture of a healthy consumer spending pattern  
out there, but the picture is getting more murky,'' said Steve 
Paspal, senior retail analyst at Sovereign Asset Management, a 
subsidiary of John Hancock Funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``In recent months, many retailers reported sales that topped  
expectations,'' he said. ``Now we are seeing more just meet 
expectations. That shows a slight slowdown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a strong year for retailers, which have benefited  
greatly this year from the resilient U.S. economy with low 
unemployment and tame inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Many merchants, however, have worried in recent months that  
borrowing and spending would slow after the Federal Reserve raised 
interest rates twice this summer in a preemptive strike against 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the Fed's two rate hikes have unsettled investors and  
weighed down the stock market -- including retail shares -- consumers 
so far have been unfazed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rate hikes were greeted with a big yawn by the consumer  
and their spending continues,'' said Kurt Barnard, a retail 
consultant and president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report in Upper 
Montclair, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	But Michael Niemira, a retail analyst at Bank of  
Tokyo-Mitsubishi, pointed out that August sales rose 6.6 percent 
overall -- which is still considered healthy -- but the gains were 
lower than the 7.3 percent seen during the January to July period. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may just be seeing a slight, temporary pause, or it could  
be signaling something else,'' Niemira said. ``There seems to be a 
little weakness in the numbers and we will have to wait to see if 
that continues into September.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for August, Wal-Mart was one of the top performers. The  
world's largest retailer was very aggressive with its prices on 
back-to-school merchandise -- which ended up hurting its 
competitors, namely Kmart. 
</P>
<P>
	Also reporting strong sales were the Limited and Gap, which  
lured shoppers with their trendy fashions, like capri pants and 
stretchy shirts with three-quarter sleeves. 
</P>
<P>
	Moderately priced department store chains such as J.C. Penney  
and Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. did not fare as well, continuing to lose 
sales to the discounters and department store chains. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears and Penney both warned Thursday that its third-quarter  
earnings would be lower than Wall Street analysts' estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart's sales from stores open at least a year rose 8.7  
percent compared with August 1998, while total sales rose 26.9 
percent from year-ago levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales from stores open at least a year, known as same-store  
sales, are considered the most accurate measure of a retailer's 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Selected figures on August's sales at leading retail chains:  
</P>
<P>
	--Sears, same-store sales rose 0.1 percent, total sales down 3.3  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Kmart, same-store sales up 3.4 percent, total sales up 5.6  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--J.C. Penney, same-store department store sales down 3.2  
percent; same-store sales at Eckerd drugstores up 8.8 percent; 
total sales up 5.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Dayton Hudson, same-store sales up 4.9 percent, total sales up  
9.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Federated, same-store sales up 2.9 percent, total sales up 14  
percent. Federated's total sales include revenues from the Internet 
and catalog seller Fingerhut, which was acquired in March. 
</P>
<P>
	--May Department Stores, same-store sales up 3.6 percent, total  
sales up 8.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Limited, same-store sales up 12 percent, total sales up 10  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Gap, same-store sales up 8 percent, total sales up 29 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Ann Taylor same-store sales up 9 percent, total sales up 21  
percent.

<HEADLINE> CDC: Mother-to-Child Syphilis Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The rate of mother-to-child syphilis has  
plummeted 78 percent since 1992, the government said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Syphilis, a sexually transmitted disease once feared as much as  
AIDS, can also be spread from a pregnant woman to her fetus. Fetal 
infections, called congenital syphilis, can result in retardation 
or death. 
</P>
<P>
	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 801 cases of  
mother-to-child syphilis were reported last year, for a rate of 21 
infections per 100,000 births. In 1992, the rate was more than 90 
per 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC said safe-sex practices because of AIDS, such as condom  
use and having fewer sex partners, have reduced the rate of 
sexually transmitted syphilis. That, in turn, has led to the sharp 
drop in congenital syphilis.

<HEADLINE> Census Plans on Doing Better Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The money is still up in the air, but  
otherwise Census 2000 is on track, Census Director Kenneth Prewitt 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	The national head count is scheduled for next April 1, but  
millions of forms have already been printed and 520 local offices 
are being established. Hundreds of thousands of staff must be hired 
in the nation's biggest peacetime effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the budget process does unfold on schedule, we will have a  
very good census,'' Prewitt said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do have a better census plan,'' he said. ``It is a much  
more sophisticated operational effort than we were able to mount in 
1990. However, demography and the attitudes of the American people 
are running against us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said his agency hopes to match the 1990 performance when only  
1.6 percent of the population was missed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be pleased if our overall count reaches 98 or 98.5  
percent,'' Prewitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he added, the time is over for debate about how the count  
must be done. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're going to have this thing in the field next March,  
we've got to be doing it and we can no longer be arguing about how 
we will do it,'' Prewitt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Already 227 million census forms have been printed and the  
presses will continue to run, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 
until the end of January to complete the 426 million that are 
needed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The potential threat to the count lies in Congress, where  
decisions on funding must be made in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	A dispute over the use of statistical estimation methods was  
ended by the Supreme Court in January, with a ruling that 
estimation cannot be used for the basic set of numbers used to 
redistribute seats in the House of Representatives. But the court 
left open the opportunity to use statistical methods to correct 
that count for other uses, such as distributing funds for various 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the ruling will require a more extensive and costly  
effort to contact every household, the bureau asked for an extra 
$1.7 billion, in addition to the $2.9 billion already requested for 
fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	But Congress and the White House have been at odds over spending  
programs, and Prewitt remains concerned that this could jeopardize 
money for the bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the funds and the current planning effort, Prewitt  
said, the agency still faces a daunting task in finding and 
counting everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are more people who are recent immigrants and therefore  
don't speak English, ... more people living in irregular housing 
conditions,'' he said. ``There are a lot of housing conditions and 
demographic conditions that make it difficult to reach 100 
percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And some people just have bad attitudes.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have people who are skeptical, indifferent, apathetic,  
don't want to cooperate. And we have people who are outright 
hostile and will refuse to be counted,'' Prewitt added. ``So there 
is no way we will get to 100 percent. Our best estimate right now 
is that we are going to run harder to stay in place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That running will use up a lot of resources, according to  
Prewitt, who offered the following statistics: 
</P>
<P>
	--Printing the forms will use 14,000 tons of recycled paper and  
15,000 gallons of ink. 
</P>
<P>
	--There are 85 different questionnaires, including the long and  
short forms and special forms for group quarters, military bases, 
ships, homeless shelters, soup kitchens and the homeless.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Attack Suspect Is Arraigned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- A man pleaded innocent today to charges that he  
stabbed three people on an Amtrak train. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron Hall, 41, of Ontario, Calif., was arraigned in Common  
Pleas Court on one count of attempted murder and three of felonious 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall, who was arraigned in a video link from the county jail,  
asked that an attorney be appointed for him. Judge Chris Boyko set 
bond at $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall is accused of stabbing two Amtrak conductors and a  
passenger on Aug. 26 about 15 miles west of Cleveland. In an 
earlier court appearance, he had claimed he acted in self-defense 
after he was threatened with a gun. The claim was similar to one he 
made the day before the train attack when he was removed from a bus 
for being unruly.

<P>
	ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- Jarious Jackson is supposed to be a  
running quarterback. Still, he passes well enough to make Michigan 
nervous. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime you have a mobile quarterback like that, it puts more  
pressure all over the defense,'' Michigan strong safety Tommy 
Hendricks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, Jackson ran for 62 yards and tossed two touchdown  
passes as Notre Dame beat Michigan 36-20. As a result, the No. 7 
Wolverines will pay special attention to Jackson when the No. 16 
Irish come calling on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the opener for the Wolverines. Notre Dame has  
played once, a 48-13 victory last week over Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson played a big role in that win. He scored on a 38-yard  
run on a broken play and gained 85 yards while guiding the Irish to 
452 yards of total offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kansas made me run,'' Jackson said. ``But I liked that.''  
</P>
<P>
	On the down side, he completed only 9 of 17 passes for 85 yards,  
and threw three interceptions. If he makes that many mistakes 
against Michigan, it could be a long afternoon for the Irish. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing we told Jarious was to `let it rip,''' coach Bob  
Davie said. ``We've got 11 games left and we're not going to start 
concerning ourselves with interceptions right now. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's silly to get in that kind of game and get everybody tight  
about it. Hey, Jarious Jackson is the least of our problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan coach Lloyd Carr has refused to name his quarterback,  
although it probably will be Tom Brady. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady, a fifth-year senior, started all 13 games last season  
while leading the Wolverines to a 10-3 record, a share of the Big 
Ten championship and a Citrus Bowl victory over Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	But even if the choice is Brady, there is a good chance  
sophomore Drew Henson will get plenty of time. Henson, who played 
in the New York Yankees' farm system during the summer, is 
considered more mobile. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady is a drop-back passer who completed 23 of 36 passes for  
267 yards in his first start last year at Notre Dame. But it was 
Henson who threw the only Michigan touchdown pass in that game. 
</P>
<P>
	In other games involving Top Ten teams Saturday, it's Akron at  
No. 2 Penn State, Wyoming at No. 3 Tennessee, Western Michigan at 
No. 4 Florida, No. 5 Nebraska at Iowa, Florida A&AMP;M at Miami, Murray 
State at No. 9 Wisconsin and No. 10 Georgia Tech at Navy. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee opens defense of its national championship against a  
Wyoming team coming off a solid 8-3 season. Leading the No. 3 
Volunteers will be quarterback Tee Martin and running back Jamal 
Lewis, who had a big freshman season in 1997 but missed most of 
1998 with a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 5 Nebraska is looking to rebound from an injury-plagued 9-4  
season, an off year for the Cornhuskers. The Hawkeyes have a new 
coach in Kirk Ferentz. He succeeds Hayden Fry, who retired after 20 
years at Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be lot of attention on South Carolina's game at North  
Carolina State, with Lou Holtz making his debut as coach of the 
visiting Gamecocks. Holtz, who won more than 100 games before 
leaving Notre Dame after the 1996 season, went 33-12-3 as coach of 
North Carolina State in 1972-75. The Wolfback is coming off an 
upset of Texas.

<HEADLINE> Fryman Back With Indians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Travis Fryman feels like it's February and he's  
down in Florida at spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	Fryman, sidelined since July with a torn ligament in his right  
knee, was recalled from a rehabilitation assignment on Thursday by 
the Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like starting over to some extent,'' said Fryman, who  
played third base in the ninth inning of Thursday night's 6-5 
victory over the Anaheim Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	Fryman tore the posterior collateral ligament in his knee after  
colliding with Kansas City first baseman Jeremy Giambi in a July 3 
game. He went on the DL the next day for just the second time in 
his career. Earlier this year, he was sidelined with back spasms 
and made his first trip to the DL in nine seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Fryman, now wearing a large brace on his knee, began a 20-day  
rehab stint for Double-A Akron and Triple-A Buffalo on Aug. 24. He 
batted a combined .217 (5-for-23) with two homers and six RBIs in 
seven games. He played some third base but used primarily as a 
designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	With the postseason nearing, Fryman wanted to get in at least 30  
games with the Indians so he could get himself ready for October. 
He said he hasn't had to slide yet and is still not running as well 
as he would like. 
</P>
<P>
	Fryman, who was not in the Indians' starting lineup Thursday  
night but could see some action, said his knee is pain free but 
that he hasn't been able to test it like he wants. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can work in the weight room, but the athleticism it takes  
to play you can't really duplicate,'' he said. ``You can take 
fungoes all day long, but reacting to balls off the bat and things 
like that you can only replicate in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fryman said the brace, which goes from his lower thigh to his  
calf, doesn't restrict what he can do defensively. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be limited in some extent,'' he said. ``Not the  
brace as much as the injury. It's not an injury you bounce right 
back from a few weeks later and you're 100 percent. It takes a 
period of time to get where you were, but at this time it's doing 
pretty well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To make room for Fryman, the Indians transferred catcher Sandy  
Alomar from the 15- to 60-day disabled list. Alomar, sidelined 
since May 17 following knee surgery, will begin a 20-day rehab 
stint Friday with Akron. 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar, too, is hoping to be ready for the postseason.  
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove, who could use Fryman at DH to get him some at-bats,  
has had to juggle his lineup and starting rotation all season 
because of injuries. He's happy that Fryman, one of the Indians 
leaders, is available to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good to have one of your guys back, especially one you  
can depend on,'' he said. ``Hopefully, we can get him sharp enough 
where he can contribute during the postseason.''

<HEADLINE> Fires Can Rejuvenate Wilderness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOUNT BALDY VILLAGE, Calif. (AP) -- Flames race up a  
chaparral-covered hillside, leaving behind smoldering, blackened 
bushes and scorched earth eerily absent of animals. 
</P>
<P>
	But this is far from a disaster for the Angeles National Forest.  
</P>
<P>
	After all, dead brush was burned away, and seeds will now have a  
chance to grow in soil enriched by ash. Animals will return to find 
more grazing area, and birds can more easily see their rodent prey. 
</P>
<P>
	From an environmental point of view, wildfires are not  
necessarily a bad thing. 
</P>
<P>
	Fires such as a still-smoldering 600-acre blaze below towering  
Mount Baldy have always been an important renewing force in the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wildlife actually benefits from this in the long term,'' said  
Karen Fortus, a resource officer for the U.S. Forest Service. ``It 
opens up areas that animals haven't been able to get to because the 
vegetation was just so thick they couldn't even get through it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, policies of fighting every fire have led to thicker  
brush that burns hotter and spreads flames faster. These intense 
fires can create a waterproof crust that causes winter runoff 
problems and keeps nutrients from seeping into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Agencies like the Forest Service and the National Park Service  
are increasingly using wildfires as a tool to manage resources. 
Some naturally sparked fires in remote areas are allowed to burn. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have that luxury here,'' Fortus said of the Mount  
Baldy fire that burned within miles of housing developments. ``With 
all the improvements and structures we have, it would be very 
politically risky, and personal property is more important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The blaze was ignited in roadside brush by an Aug. 25 car crash.  
The fire spread to within a mile of new developments springing up 
near the 10,080-foot mountain about 50 miles east of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters contained the fire within four days with no  
injuries or property damage. Hot spots were being doused by 
helicopter a week later, when Fortus and wildlife biologist Patti 
Krueger hiked through a canyon that used to be covered in 
chest-high scrub that had not burned since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Now only the black skeletons of manzanita and chamise chaparral  
dot a landscape painted in gray. 
</P>
<P>
	It looks like everything died, but Krueger and Fortus see life.  
</P>
<P>
	Within months, seeds -- some dropped years ago -- will germinate  
because of the fire's heat. Other plants will simply grow new 
sprouts in soil enriched by nitrates and other nutrients in the 
ash. 
</P>
<P>
	The new growth will attract animals that before could not find  
food in the canyon dense with dead chaparral. Along the edge of the 
fire line, deer and other animals will be hidden from predators by 
unburned growth as they eat the sprouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Within a day or two after a fire, deer can be seen licking the  
ashes for nutrients. Some roll in the warm ashes, perhaps to kill 
ticks in their hides. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, the next three years are going to be an abundant time  
for wildlife in the area,'' Krueger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Very few animals are found dead as a result of a fire, said  
Richard Minnich, a University of California at Riverside earth 
sciences professor who also toured the fire area. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people think wildlife is devastated by fire,'' he  
said. ``Birds can fly away. Animals can outrun it or burrow into 
the ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Angeles National Forest and across the West, rangers  
routinely set fires to clear brush and rejuvenate the soil Such 
``prescription'' burns are often unpopular with nearby residents 
and tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	``California is going to burn, and there's going to be a lot of  
smoke,'' said Barbara Bonefeld, a fire use specialist for the U.S. 
Forest Service. ``It's a question of: Do you want smoke under 
conditions where you can manage it or when you can't?''

<HEADLINE> Underwood Separates Left Shoulder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Unpredictable rookie defensive end  
Dimitrius Underwood dislocated his left shoulder during the Miami 
Dolphins' exhibition game against the Green Bay Packers Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, who disappeared from the Minnesota Vikings' camp last  
month and was picked up by the Dolphins after the Vikings dropped 
him, wasn't expected to play against the Packers. But after 
defensive end Rich Owens went down with bruised ribs, coach Jimmy 
Johnson used Underwood sparingly during the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood apparently suffered the injury late in the third  
quarter after landing hard on the shoulder. He left the field under 
his own power, and moments later the team announced Underwood had 
separated the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the team changed the diagnosis to a dislocated shoulder.  
</P>
<P>
	Underwood practiced with the Dolphins for the first time on  
Tuesday. He arrived in Florida a day late after missing two flights 
from Michigan, but the Dolphins elected to bring him to Green Bay 
for their final preseason game. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood sacrificed a $1.75 million signing bonus by leaving  
the Vikings, and he's getting a base salary of $395,000 in the 
first season of a five-year contract with Miami.

<P>
	INTERLOCHEN, Mich. (AP) -- Matthew Anderson enrolled at  
Interlochen Center for the Arts a year ago as a piano major. Then 
he took an organ class and was hooked. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're both keyboard instruments, but you can do so much more  
with the organ,'' said the 15-year-old from Galveston, Texas. ``I 
may make a career of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's music to the ears of his instructor, Robert Murphy, and  
to the American Guild of Organists. For the past decade the group 
has worked to strike a chord of interest among youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	It's no small matter to churches and synagogues, many struggling  
to find someone to play the pipe organ, instrumental since the 
Middle Ages to choirs and congregations singing soul-stirring 
hymns. 
</P>
<P>
	Some houses of worship have turned to the piano, guitar or even  
recorded music. But the likes of ``Joyful, Joyful, We Adore Thee'' 
and ``A Mighty Fortress'' just don't pack the same punch without 
pipes. Not to mention a rousing Bach fugue at the conclusion of the 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's still a very large audience for the organ, in concert  
halls as well as churches,'' said Frederick Swann, retired after 16 
years as organist at the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, Calif. 
Its Sunday services, led by the Rev. Robert Schuller, are televised 
internationally on the ``Hour of Power'' program. 
</P>
<P>
	Swann, now organist in residence at First Congregational Church  
is Los Angeles, gave a recital and conducted master classes with 
aspiring organists this summer at Interlochen, a boarding high 
school and music camp in Michigan's northern Lower Peninsula. After 
performing for a standing-room-only crowd, he was surrounded by 
teens seeking autographs and asking questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Swann says the experience reinforced his belief that, given a  
chance, young people will study the organ. He also thinks they will 
enter the profession if churches provide meaningful job 
opportunities and decent wages. 
</P>
<P>
	A lack of full-time jobs and low pay are long-standing gripes  
for organists. Hours can be long, with duties including organ 
practice and choir rehearsals, weddings and funerals and regular 
worship services. 
</P>
<P>
	Salaries vary widely, but full-time positions advertised in the  
guild magazine and on its Web site seldom exceed $35,000, and many 
are in the $20,000s. Many church organists supplement their incomes 
by teaching, giving recitals or working part-time in other fields, 
according to the guild's executive director, James Thomashower. 
</P>
<P>
	Artistic differences with the minister or congregation can pose  
problems as well. ``There are churches where the quality of music 
they want is so poor that it's no challenge to a young musician,'' 
Swann said. 
</P>
<P>
	All this has taken its toll in recent decades, especially as  
many churches have opted for Christian pop music and ``praise 
bands'' with electric guitars, drums and synthesizers. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of organ majors at U.S. colleges has been stable  
since the late 1980s. There were 563 in 1986-87 and 576 this 
spring, according to the National Association of Schools of Music 
in Reston, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the New York-based organists guild was concerned enough  
for the future of the ``king of instruments'' to begin a 
recruitment drive in 1988. It continues today. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the initiatives: ``pipe organ encounters,'' four- or  
five-day regional seminars that introduce youngsters to the organ. 
This year's gatherings were in Seattle; Waco, Texas; and Des 
Moines, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	``What really wins them over is the sense of power that comes  
from playing on a larger instrument ... coupled with the tremendous 
variety of sound you can create,'' Wanda Griffiths, an organizer, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen-year-old Jefrey Alban, 18, of Hopewell, N.Y., said he  
felt isolated until he attended an encounter and met 50 like-minded 
people. ``Kids enjoying the organ as much as I did,'' he said. ``It 
was great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is now president of a new group, the Association of Young  
Organists. 
</P>
<P>
	Mastering the organ requires keyboard talent as well as the  
agility of a tap dancer. While the hands are darting among 
keyboards and the rows of buttons and knobs that adjust tone and 
texture, the feet are pumping pedals. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need ability, but above all you have to love it because  
you're going to devote a lot of time and energy to it,'' Murphy, 
Interlochen's instructor, says. 
</P>
<P>
	Organ classes have been offered at Interlochen since 1928.  
Students who attend the year-round academy get daily instruction 
from Murphy and polish their techniques on instruments in the 
campus chapel and in a practice building. 
</P>
<P>
	They have one-on-one sessions with virtuoso performers, attend  
workshops and go on tour, playing some of the nation's premier 
pipes such as those at Riverside Church in New York and the 
National Cathedral in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	David Dockery, an Interlochen graduate and senior at the  
University of Michigan, figures a career as organist, choir 
director and teacher will put food on the table but won't be 
lucrative. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to be a professional musician, you really can't be  
too worried about the money,'' Dockery said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of greater concern, he said, is developing a following among  
young people more attuned to the sounds of Madonna and Puff Daddy. 
To succeed, he said, tomorrow's organists should mix new 
compositions into their repertoire and ``present it as something 
worth listening to instead of something you have to sit through.''

<HEADLINE> Riley Pushing After-School Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Meaningful after-school programs could prevent  
violent tragedies like Columbine's deadly shootings, Education 
Secretary Richard W. Riley said Wednesday, but he stopped short of 
advocating tougher policies against schoolhouse bullying and 
teasing. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look at behavior issues, those are local decisions  
best made on an individual basis,'' Riley said as he celebrated a 
new national after-school partnership at a stop on his 
back-to-school bus tour. ``Something as serious as firearms is a 
different matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley, who's touring about four schools a day as he travels  
through the South this week, stopped in Centennial Park to rally a 
crowd of 2,000 behind boosting after-school programs. 
</P>
<P>
	A new survey, released Wednesday, showed 75 percent of adults  
think after-school programs could have prevented the Colorado high 
school's shooting rampage that has become the symbol of U.S. school 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	In the survey of 1,100 adults, 92 percent also believed there  
should be some type of organized activity or place for the nation's 
15 million latchkey kids to go after school. Some 86 percent said 
after-school programs were a necessity for their community. For all 
the good these programs are thought to do, nearly two-thirds of the 
surveyed adults said such programs just don't exist. 
</P>
<P>
	``Schools might close down at 3 p.m., but children's minds  
don't,'' Riley said. ``That's why we're asking Congress to triple 
funds for after-school spending from $200 million to $600 
million.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 3  
percent, was funded by the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation and 
JCPenney, which are helping the Education Department with a new 
initiative to boost after-school programs nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere on his tour Wednesday, Riley encouraged children to  
stick to their lessons and avoid conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to be interested in working together, just as you all  
are working together, trusting each other and loving each other,'' 
Riley told first- and second-graders in an innovative arts program 
at Harmony Leland Elementary School in Mableton, Ga., a small 
community west of Atlanta. ``It's a much more powerful force in 
working toward school discipline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An Illinois teen who was bullied by older schoolmates recently  
shot himself to death in his basement. High school administrators 
have vowed to punish the bullies. 
</P>

	Riley supports federal mandatory suspensions for kids who bring  
firearms to school, but his support for harsh penalties for 
students who bully or tease is not as automatic.

	``I can't imagine any child bringing a gun or any other firearm  
to school and not getting disciplined,'' he said. ``It's national

<HEADLINE> Report: Pan Am Coach Misused Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDINBURG, Texas (AP) -- Pan American basketball coach Delray  
Brooks was fired because the school thinks he deposited a $25,000 
check from a road game into his personal bank account and withdrew 
money from the account, The (McAllen) Monitor reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brooks, in a letter to athletic director Bill Weidner,  
denies the accusation and insists he did nothing wrong, the 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the memo obtained by the newspaper, Brooks said he had not  
met with school officials concerning his dismissal last week. But 
Weidner said he twice met with Brooks to discuss two memos -- a 
notice of intent to dismiss Brooks and a termination letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks did not return a phone call to The Associated Press on  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks is a former assistant coach at Kentucky who helped the  
Wildcats to three Final Four appearances, including the 1996 
national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Pan Am hired him in 1997 after the school lost its NCAA  
certification in 1996. The certification was fully restored in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks, whose salary was nearly $63,000 last season, went 8-46  
in his first two seasons and was dismissed Aug. 23. The university 
said Brooks was fired because of a police investigation concerning 
the men's basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
	Campus police said they were investigating possible misuse of  
funds. No charges have been filed. 
</P>
<P>
	The school also chose not to renew the contracts of two  
assistant coaches, George Morgan and Patrick Harrington. 
</P>
<P>
	According to an Aug. 20 memo -- the notice of intent to fire  
Brooks -- Weidner accused the coach of depositing a check for 
$25,000 from a game at Southwest Missouri State into his personal 
account. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks then made ``a number of non-university business  
withdrawals against that checking account, including substantial 
cash withdrawals,'' the memo reads. 
</P>
<P>
	In his Aug. 21 response, Brooks denied knowing how the check was  
deposited but promised to find out. 
</P>
<P>
	``In life all you have is your integrity,'' he wrote.  
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 23, Weidner notified Brooks of his termination, taking  
effect the next day. Brooks appealed his firing on Friday with a 
letter to Weidner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not once, has anyone from the university, including my direct  
supervisor, questioned me concerning the investigation of 
allegations,'' he wrote. ``No communication whatsoever. ... I will 
prove my innocence as well as restore my name and my reputation.''

<HEADLINE> Therapist Found Negligent in Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WAUSAU, Wis. (AP) -- A jury awarded $850,000 in damages to a  
woman who claimed false childhood memories implanted by her 
psychiatrist made her believe she was molested by her father and 
had multiple personalities. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury on Thursday found Dr. Juan Fernandez III negligent in  
his care of Joan Hess, who said the psychiatrist implanted memories 
during hypnosis that led her to believe she was sexually abused, 
that she had more than 75 personalities and that her parents 
belonged to a cult that forced others to have sex with animals and 
witness babies being killed and eaten. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a vindication this craziness was not her fault,'' said  
William Smoler, Mrs. Hess' attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Repressed-memory therapy contends victims of childhood trauma  
can forget the abuse for decades, and it can be the source of adult 
disorders. Recovering the memories can cure the disorders. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hess, 47, the ex-wife of former Wausau Mayor John Hess,  
contended none of the horrors her therapy revealed actually 
occurred, and that she was permanently harmed by the ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my view, there is no defense for this kind of therapy,''  
Smoler said. ``If that means that this is now a message that this 
stuff has to stop, I hope the message is delivered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez declined comment as he left the courtroom. One of his  
attorneys, Tom Rusboldt, said he was unsure about an appeal, or 
what the decision would mean to Fernandez's career. The state 
agency that licenses doctors will be notified of the verdict, 
Rusboldt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hess contended some of the personalities caused her to  
threaten suicide, forcing her to be hospitalized numerous times. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys argued that Mrs. Hess believed there was  
something bad in her past before she began treatment with 
Fernandez, and that Fernandez acted as a responsible psychiatrist 
would to help her. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dr. Fernandez did what good psychiatrists do,'' defense  
attorney Paul Grimstad said. ``He followed his training and he 
followed the textbook.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trial lasted 15 weeks, and included testimony from  
psychiatrists on repressed-memory therapy, hypnosis, and multiple 
personality disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury deliberated for 25 hours before finding that Fernandez  
was negligent for his care and treatment of Mrs. Hess, for failing 
to explain the risk of the treatment, and for failing to get her 
consent for the therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hess began treatment with Fernandez in 1991, when she was  
being treated for depression. The care continued until 1994.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Lifts Some Economy Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Malaysia's strict controls on  
sending money out of the country have boosted the economy, the 
prime minister said Thursday, a day after lifting a steep tax on 
the repatriation of foreign capital. 
</P>
<P>
	``The unorthodox, bold and strong measures which we took 366  
days ago have borne fruit,'' said Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad 
in a speech to business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea, Malaysia rebuffed  
bailouts from the International Monetary Fund during the Asian 
currency and stock market collapse in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he locked in portfolio investments for one year, halted  
offshore trading of the ringgit and pegged it at 3.8 to the dollar. 
He subsequently hiked government spending to revive mothballed 
public works projects and sinking companies. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, a part of the controls was lifted, and investors  
became eligible to repatriate their principal without paying taxes. 
But penalties remained on repatriating profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahathir said the capital controls have triggered a stock market  
recovery, rising exports and external reserves, and higher job 
demand. Two weeks ago, the central bank announced the recession was 
over and the economy was set to grow by least by 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts were divided over Mahathir's analysis that currency  
controls alone bailed out Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
	Amar Bhattacharya, a senior World Bank economist, praised  
Malaysia's recovery but doubted whether Mahathir's prescription 
could become a model path out of recession. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very difficult to isolate capital controls as the only  
(recovery) policy,'' he said. ``It doesn't mean that one policy is 
the answer for the future.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley Opposes Education Vouchers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley  
said Thursday that taxpayer-funded vouchers won't solve the problem 
of poor quality schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think school vouchers are the answer to the problems  
of public education,'' he said during a campaign swing through 
Cleveland, where a state-funded voucher program is the subject of a 
court debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said such programs have problems, ``not the least of  
which are issues of church and state,'' that must be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have to do more with the public school system  
itself,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, a former U.S. senator from New Jersey, said he voted  
twice for federally funded experimental voucher programs. Neither 
bill became law. 
</P>
<P>
	Civil liberties and public education groups have challenged a  
state-funded program that gave poor Cleveland students tuition 
vouchers of up to $2,500 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the voucher schools have religious affiliations and  
opponents argue that the program violates the constitutional 
separation of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge halted the program last month, saying it  
appeared to have the ``primary effect of advancing religion.'' But 
he later said the program can remain in place only for students who 
participated last year. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Republican presidential candidate and Texas Gov.  
George W. Bush proposed stripping poor-performing schools of 
federal education funds and letting parents spend the money on 
alternative education for their children, including private schools 
and tutoring. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said he would not support Bush's program, but would be  
in favor of giving governors more latitude to spend federal 
education funds in exchange for greater accountability.

	OWENS CROSSROADS, Ala. (AP) -- At least three people were  
injured, two critically, when a fireworks plant exploded Thursday 
afternoon here. 
</P>
<P>
	The explosion at Luna Tech, a pyrotechnics manufacturer, caused

<HEADLINE> Smith Keeps Up Presidential Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire is  
continuing his independent run for president, dispelling 
speculation last month he might drop his long-shot campaign because 
of his wife's health. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is: I'm still in the race. I'm planning to  
continue as an independent candidate. I'm very excited about it,'' 
Smith told The Associated Press on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	When Smith announced last month he would not be a candidate for  
the U.S. Taxpayers Party, he also hinted the future of his campaign 
was in question because of health concerns about his wife, Mary Jo. 
She was in the hospital for tests after suffering chest and arm 
pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said the tests were negative, his wife is fine and he is  
continuing his campaign to try to unify conservatives and other 
voters disenchanted with the political process and two-party 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 13, Smith pulled out of the Republican Party in a  
dramatic speech on the Senate floor because he felt it was not 
living up to its platform on such issues as abortion and gun 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	His first priority is rounding up possibly a quarter of a  
million signatures around the country so his name will appear on 
ballots. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not easy, but we've got thousands of volunteers,'' he  
said. ``I don't know how far it will go, but I will take it as far 
as we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore's lead over former  
New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley is narrowing in New Hampshire, 
according to a poll released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll, conducted by Franklin Pierce College in Rindge and  
WNDS-TV in Derry, found that Gore's support has remained steady 
since a similar poll in April, while Bradley's numbers have 
climbed. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 232 Democratic and Democratic-leaning independents, 44  
percent chose Gore to 37 percent for Bradley. Nineteen percent were 
undecided. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 6 percentage  
points. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Gore led Bradley nearly 2-to-1, 40 percent to 21  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The new poll also found Bradley would perform better than Gore  
against Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	The 549 voters questioned favored Bush over Gore 48 percent to  
39 percent. But they placed Bradley in a statistical dead heat with 
Bush, trailing 44 percent to 41 percent. The margin of error for 
that part of the poll was plus or minus 4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll found that independent voters seem more inclined to  
vote in the Democratic primary than they were in April. In April, 
25 percent of the independents questioned planned to vote in the 
Democratic primary. In Thursday's poll, 36 percent said they would. 
</P>
<P>
	If independents do swing to the Democratic primary, it could be  
a bonus for Bradley. The poll found independents favor Bradley over 
Gore 42 percent to 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush widened his lead among Republicans and Republican-leaning  
independents. He led the field with 48 percent, while John McCain, 
Elizabeth Dole and Steve Forbes lagged with 10 percent each. The 
margin of error for that part of the poll, which had 269 voters, 
was plus or minus 6 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Bush had 35 percent, Dole 15 percent, McCain 9 percent  
and Forbes 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll of randomly selected registered voters was conducted  
from Sunday through Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Breaking with almost all of his Ohio  
colleagues, Sen. Mike DeWine on Thursday announced he's backing 
fellow Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona for the party's 
presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	DeWine said he'll make his endorsement official at a Friday  
appearance with McCain in Concord, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	The first-term senator said he believes McCain's experiences,  
particularly his foreign policy knowledge and military background, 
make him most suited to be the GOP nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am endorsing him because I have known him for 17 years and I  
think he would be a great president,'' DeWine said. ``This is the 
man who in my opinion should be commander-in-chief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Bob Taft and almost every other Republican official in  
Ohio, and the businesses that finance campaigns in Ohio, are 
backing Texas Gov. George Bush, who grossed $1 million from a 
single Cincinnati fund-raising trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Before DeWine made his choice known, the only prominent  
defection from the solid Bush front was state Treasurer Kenneth 
Blackwell, who is prominent in the campaign of publisher Steve 
Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	Still up for grabs: the endorsements of two holdout congressmen,  
Paul Gillmor and Steve Chabot, plus that of the state's junior 
senator, George Voinovich. A spokesman said no Voinovich 
endorsement has been planned.

<HEADLINE> Most Asian Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian markets closed lower Thursday on  
various local news, with the large Tokyo market dipping slightly on 
the yen's recent strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped 171.23  
points, or 0.96 percent, to 17,631.25. On Wednesday, the average 
had surged 2.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong yen makes Japanese goods more expensive and less  
competitive overseas, and Japanese exporters lose revenues in terms 
of the Japanese currency. 
</P>
<P>
	But some analysts said hopes of an economic recovery in Japan  
continued to lift market sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite the yen's strength, the market remains comparatively  
strong,'' said Kazunori Jinnai of Daiwa Securities SB Capital 
Markets in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	In the currency market, the yen fell back just slightly. The  
U.S. dollar bought 109.42 yen at late afternoon, up 0.20 yen from 
its level of 109.22 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its 
late New York level of 109.05 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong prices fell on losses by market heavyweight HSBC  
Holdings and other financial sector stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark Hang Seng Index fell 176.63 points, or 1.3  
percent, to 13,367.56. On Wednesday, the index had risen 0.5 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1.8 percent loss by HSBC Holdings -- the market's largest  
capitalized share -- dragged down financial sector blue chips, but 
some analysts said the selloff was too sharp. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market's downward adjustment is unreasonable, particularly  
as it seems to completely ignore a recent slew of good news,'' said 
Sean Li of Amsteel Securities Ltd. 
</P>

	Last week, the government announced that the Hong Kong economy  
had risen 0.5 percent in the second quarter after 15 months of 
contraction.

<HEADLINE> Canada To Test-Burn U.S. Nuke Waste </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Energy Department will ship a truckload of  
plutonium-blend reactor fuel from the Los Alamos lab in New Mexico 
to Canada later this year to test whether Canada's reactors can be 
used to dispose of weapons-grade plutonium. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and Canadian officials announced agreement Thursday on the  
shipment. The experiment at the CANDU reactor in Chalk River, 
Ontario, 100 miles west of Ottawa also will involve a separate 
shipment of similar mixed-oxide fuel from Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The fuel is a mixture of plutonium oxide and uranium oxide. The  
Energy Department previously announced that about 36 tons of 
plutonium from the U.S. weapons program will be burned as a 
mixed-oxide fuel at three U.S. civilian reactors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian experiments are designed to determine whether the  
Canadian reactors -- a different design than the U.S. light-water 
reactors -- also can use the mixed-oxide fuel as part of a plutonium 
disposal plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada has committed only to the tests, although the Canadian  
government has offered to burn as much as 100 tons of the plutonium 
blend over a 25-year period. The test burns are expected to take 
several years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The test is a step forward in getting rid of nuclear weapons,  
and the government of Canada is committed to decreasing the number 
of nuclear weapons in the world,'' said Canadian Foreign Affairs 
Minister Lloyd Axworthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, nine mixed-oxide fuel rods containing 120  
grams of plutonium will be shipped sometime this fall by truck from 
the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico to Sault St. 
Marie, Mich., where it will cross into Canada, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The shipments have caused concern in states along the routes,  
especially in Michigan. Antinuclear groups and some members of the 
Canadian Parliament also have voiced opposition to the program, 
fearing Canada will become a dumping ground for Cold War-era 
plutonium from both Russia and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nuclear Control Institute, a Washington-based  
nonproliferation advocacy groups, also has voiced concerns about 
using the CANDU reactors for plutonium disposal. Other countries, 
including South Korea, have the same design reactors and may pursue 
similar programs, said Steven Dolley, the institute's research 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Canadian and U.S. officials characterized the Canadian  
program as another step to ensure that the plutonium is disposed of 
safely and kept out of the hands of rogue states and terrorists 
seeking to use if in weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department said in a statement that the fuel rods  
will be shipped inside special containers and carried on a truck 
with no other cargo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The shipment will be tracked by satellite and the truck  
drivers will be in continuous radio communications with the 
Department of Energy and their company,'' said the statement. 
Emergency response teams and law enforcement officials along the 
route will be notified in advance and both Canadian and U.S. law 
enforcement officers ``will cooperate to protect the shipment from 
terrorist action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The disposal plan calls for pure plutonium from weapons pits, or  
triggers, to be converted into plutonium oxide and then mixed with 
uranium oxide to create the mixed-oxide, or MOX, fuel that can be 
burned in a civilian reactor much like the conventional uranium 
fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	The fuel rods at Los Alamos already have been processed into MOX  
fuel, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Arizona's Swann Breaks Silence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- Eric Swann, Arizona's standout defensive  
tackle recovering from major surgery on his arthritic right knee, 
said Thursday he hopes to be playing football again in six to eight 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaking his long silence, Swann spoke on a telephone conference  
call from his home. What he said had to disappoint the Cardinals, 
who hoped the two-time Pro Bowl performer would be ready for the 
Sept. 12 opener at Philadelphia. But the rehabilitation is taking 
longer than originally expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not bothered by it,'' Swann said, ``because I have to be  
100 percent when I step back on the field and that's a fact. I 
can't go out there half-ready or a quarter-ready, I've got to be 
100 percent. The surgery was a very aggressive surgery and 
sometimes it takes longer than usual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Swann's timetable is accurate, at the earliest he wouldn't be  
back until the Oct. 17 home game against Washington. Arizona has 
the following week off, then plays New England at home on Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Swann went to San Francisco on Wednesday to be examined by Dr.  
Richard Steadman, the noted knee specialist who performed the 
surgery on Dec. 7. Tests conducted by Steadman showed the strength 
and flexibility of the knee had increased from 50 percent to 80 
percent of normal. 
</P>
<P>
	Swann played in seven games last season, then had surgery  
performed by the Cardinals' orthopedist Russell Chick. The team 
expected him back in a few weeks, but he was dissatisfied with the 
results and went to Steadman, the Colorado-based doctor who 
performed major surgery on Olympic gold medalist skier Picabo 
Street and many other noted athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a smart decision on my behalf,'' he said. ``It's a  
personal decision and it's not against anybody else. Eric Swann has 
to take care of Eric Swann.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steadman performed an unusual ``microfacture'' surgery designed  
to help regenerate cartilage growth. Swann said he had been in 
extreme pain and his career would have been over if he'd tried to 
play the remainder of last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you were to take the knee and just split it in half and  
look at it, there's a lot of wear and tear in the hard cartilage on 
the bones there,'' Swann said. ``There were a lot of bald spots 
there that were actually wearing out. There were nerves hitting 
nerves. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have a situation like that, it makes it very tender  
to walk around and very tender to get in the squatting position and 
play, because you've got a lot of grind. On top of that, you add 
300-plus or 600-plus pounds of guys double-teaming you and cutting 
you and you've got a pretty heavy, spicy, ouchy dish, if you know 
what I mean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Swann said, ``if things stay on course and there aren't any  
terrible setbacks or anything and I don't rush it, I could play 
another five or six years easy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Swann hadn't spoken to reporters about his condition since  
before last year's first surgery. In his brief conference call, he 
insisted he was not bothered by the criticism he received from fans 
and local sports talk show hosts who thought he should have played 
through the pain as the Cardinals made their postseason run. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's an old saying that we use in football,'' he said.  
```When you're well, you're hell. When you're hurt, you're dirt.' 
I'm not really moved by what people say in their comments or 
anything like that. People have a right to their opinions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Swann refused to criticize the Cardinals organization.  
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, they've been pretty supportive,'' he said. ``Of  
course, they want you on the football field. That's what they hired 
me to do. When you're not out there, there's always that pressure 
to get back out there earlier. But overall, I would say I've been 
pretty satisfied with the support I've received from my club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, Cardinals coach Vince Tobin said Wednesday's  
examination ``means he's going in the right direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think, since we've come back down to the valley, the heat's  
helped Eric's conditioning,'' Tobin said. ``He's continued to work 
at it, so I'm encouraged.''

<HEADLINE> Conviction in Foster Parents Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONROE, Ga. (AP) -- A 22-year-old man was convicted Thursday of  
killing four members of a family who once took him in while he was 
trying to kick drugs and drinking. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Scott Heidler faces execution for the rampage.  
</P>
<P>
	Jurors cried as they watched a video of the blood-soaked home in  
the town of Santa Claus where Kim Daniels, 33; her husband, Danny, 
47; and their two children, Jessica, 16, and Bryant, 8, died from 
shotgun blasts as they slept Dec. 4, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just went from room to room, shooting,'' Heidler mumbled in  
an interview with police videotaped the day after the killings. ``I 
went berserk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the shooting, Heidler kidnapped the couple's three girls,  
ages 8, 9, and 10, and sexually assaulted one of them. Two boys, 
Corey, 4, and Gabriel, 10 months, were left at the house unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the seven children were in foster care. The couple had  
been foster parents and once cared for Heidler's younger sister. 
</P>
<P>
	Heidler had also lived for a time in the home, and the couple  
had brought him with them to church. 
</P>
<P>
	Nic D'Alesandro, a forensic psychologist, testified that Heidler  
had been an alcoholic since 11, began using drugs in his teens, and 
burned himself with cigarettes because it felt good. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury is to decide whether Heidler will get the electric  
chair.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Seizes Pirated Video Discs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Customs officials seized (US) $6.2 million  
worth of pirated video compact discs along with production 
equipment in the largest haul ever in Hong Kong's campaign to 
eradicate copyright piracy, the government reported today. . 
</P>
<P>
	Officials seized 1.6 million pirated VCDs, a large quantity of  
equipment and one truck in separate raids Wednesday, a government 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a hundred customs officers were mobilized in raids on  
the VCD factory and four warehouses in the suburban New 
Territories, the statement added. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine men -- aged between 23 and 53 -- were arrested, but no  
charges have been filed. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first seven months of this year, customs officials have  
seized 8.8 million pirated VCDs with a total value of $20 million, 
the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite frequent raids, Hong Kong remains a center for copyright  
pirating. Pirated CDs, video CDs and computer software are widely 
available at shopping arcades and street vendors at a fraction of 
the cost of a genuine copy -- sometimes even before the originals 
are released in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Pork King Murphy To Sell Farms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- The nation's two largest hog growers  
announced a $290 million merger Thursday, a shakeout from last 
year's rock-bottom producer pork prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Smithfield Foods Inc., of Smithfield, Va., the world's largest  
hog producer and processor, agreed to buy No. 2 producer Murphy 
Family Farms of Rose Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase involves about 10 million shares of Smithfield  
Foods plus the assumption of about $170 million in Murphy Farms 
debt and other liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy Family Farms, which specializes in raising hogs under  
contracts with independent farmers, struggled in the past year as 
pork prices hit the lowest prices in decades, said Kelly Zering, a 
North Carolina State University professor of agricultural resource 
economics. 
</P>
<P>
	Founder and chief executive officer Wendell H. Murphy signed a  
letter of intent Wednesday to sell his family-owned company to 
Smithfield, effective Jan. 1. Forbes magazine ranked it No. 355 on 
its 1998 list of privately held companies, with an estimated $650 
million in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Smithfield Foods, with $3.77 billion in sales for the year ended  
in April, will control 60 percent of the merged business operations 
from research and raising hogs to processing and distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	``Murphy Farms for some time has been analyzing the need for an  
alliance with a food processor to ensure stability for the Murphy 
family, the growers and the employees,'' said Lois Britt, a vice 
president and spokeswoman for Murphy Family Farms. 
</P>
<P>
	No layoffs are anticipated, and Wendell Murphy's future role in  
the merged companies has not yet been determined, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Low pork prices led the government to send hog producers at  
least $175 million in aid last year. Producer prices have since 
rebounded, with hog farmers getting 46 cents a pound again. 
</P>
<P>
	Smithfield Foods, which sends about 5.5 million hogs to market  
annually, raises hogs in North Carolina, South Carolina, Colorado, 
Virginia and Utah. A subsidiary, Carroll's Foods Inc., also 
produces hogs in Brazil and Mexico. Its products also are sold in 
Japan and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined pork giant would control about 15 percent of the  
hogs on U.S. farms, giving Smithfield Foods less impact on pork 
prices than Tyson Foods Inc. in chicken or IBP Inc. in beef, said 
Grimes and analyst George Shipp.

<HEADLINE> Deal Eludes Israelis, Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Egypt (AP) -- American and Palestinians converged on  
the Mediterranean resort of Alexandria today to try to salvage a 
Middle East peace agreement, but with Israeli official absent, a 
deal seemed unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	In a display of brinksmanship earlier today in Jerusalem,  
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators who had hammered out agreement 
on series of difficult points refused to budge on one -- the release 
of a few dozen Palestinian prisoners -- that is holding up a revised 
West Bank land-for-security deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Egyptians had hoped to host a signing ceremony between  
Israelis and Palestinians in Alexandria in the presence of U.S. 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who arrived here this 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials said Albright was prepared to intervene to  
resolve the deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she feels this is a good deal for both sides and it  
would be a shame if it were lost,'' said a senior Clinton 
administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinian negotiators Saeb Erekat and Mohammed Dahlan headed  
to Alexandria this afternoon, summoned by Palestinian leader Yasser 
Arafat, who arrived earlier for talks with Egyptian President Hosni 
Mubarak. 
</P>
<P>
	The office of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, said the  
premier had no immediate plans to travel to Alexandria. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. administration had billed Albright's Mideast tour not  
as a mediating visit, but as a stocktaking trip, perhaps even an 
opportunity to move on from the Israeli-Palestinian track to try to 
revive long-stalled Israeli talks with Syria. 
</P>
<P>
	State-run Damascus radio urged Albright to be forceful.  
</P>
<P>
	``The announced goal of Albright's tour is to push the peace  
process forward. This necessitates an active American role,'' said 
the broadcast. Albright is expected in Damascus on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	At first glance, the gaps between the Israelis and the  
Palestinians appeared easily solved, considering that both sides 
have already spent weeks in grueling negotiations to revise the Wye 
River interim agreement that was signed in October at the White 
House. They have compromised on difficult issues, such as a new 
timetable for Israeli troop pullbacks in the West Bank and a new 
deadline for a permanent peace accord -- September 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding Palestinian prisoners, Israel has offered to free 356  
held for anti-Israeli activities, while the Palestinians sought the 
release of 400. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel has said principles were at stake and that it would not  
release Palestinians who killed Israelis. Israeli Justice Minister 
Yossi Beilin said Israel would not budge on the criteria it has set 
for the release of prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	Beilin, a veteran of negotiations with the Palestinians, said  
Israel was serious about making peace with the Palestinians and was 
not worried about delays. ``If it takes a couple more days (to 
negotiate), it's not the end of the world,'' Beilin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the emerging deal, Israel would withdraw from another 11  
percent of the West Bank in three stages, starting at the beginning 
of September and ending Jan. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations on a permanent peace agreement would begin  
immediately after the first pullback. Within five months of the 
start of negotiations, Israelis and Palestinians would complete a 
framework agreement on the so-called final status issues, such as 
the fate of Palestinian refugees, Palestinian statehood and the 
future of Jewish settlements. A final agreement would be completed 
within a year of the start of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak has said that if the Palestinians don't accept the revised  
accord, he will implement the Wye agreement to the letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Palestinians initially demanded an exact  
implementation of Wye, they would apparently prefer the 
renegotiated version, because they would get more land sooner and 
would win the release of more security prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised agreement also gives the Palestinians the go-ahead  
to build a port in Gaza City and sets dates for the opening of land 
routes connecting the West Bank and Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel, in turn, benefits because the agreement defuses the  
potential threat of a unilateral Palestinian declaration of 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Each side blamed the other for the last-minute snag. Barak  
spokesman David Ziso said Israel was still waiting for answers from 
the Palestinians. Palestinian negotiator Erekat said it was up to 
Israel to pick up the phone. 
</P>
<P>
	Tempers were frayed in the last round of talks Wednesday.  
Shouting could occasionally be heard throughout the corridors 
outside the conference room. Repeated calls were made to Egyptian 
leaders.

<HEADLINE> John Forde Dissects TV Ads on PBS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Talk about a pitch man. John Forde can seduce  
you into paying attention to television commercials and then, get 
this, thinking about them. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because Forde, a charmingly loose cannon who has fixed  
his aim on the American way of selling, knows how to entertain as 
he encourages us to avoid being patsies with credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mental Engineering'' is his vehicle, a new half-hour series  
that is making its way to an increasing number of PBS stations. The 
premise is simple: Forde and his guests, including professors, 
comics and writers, view and critique TV ads. 
</P>
<P>
	The result isn't exactly argument television a la ``Politically  
Incorrect'' or ``The McLaughlin Group,'' but there is lively 
discussion as panelists zing the manipulative tricks shamelessly 
employed by advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
	Setting the tone is Forde, who comes across like Jim Carrey with  
a master's degree. His approach can verge on the scholarly (he was, 
after all, a philosophy major) and the conversation occasionally 
sounds like a self-conscious dorm session. 
</P>
<P>
	But Forde, with a toothy, manic grin that gives him away, prods  
his guests to lighten the mood with smart-minded quips. 
</P>
<P>
	In discussing a commercial touting a paper towel's germ-fighting  
abilities, he asks why the bathroom in the ad is shot out of focus. 
So you can't see the overflowing landfill outside the window, 
panelist Kristin Tillotson suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	Comedian Tim Mitchell's ire is stoked by a commercial for an  
economy car that plays on class differences by asking whether rich 
people are ``more entitled to brake safely on a rainy day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think people are going to fall for this ad, that  
somehow Buick is against the rich. Yeah, 'Buy the new Buick 
Commie-mobile,'' quips Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mental Engineering' has its roots in cable access television  
and retains some production minimalism: simple graphics and a spare 
set, and editing that could use a bit more spark. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew going into it we needed to make awkward look somewhat  
cool,'' says Forde (pronounced Ford-dee), speaking from St. Paul, 
Minn., where he lives and where the show is taped. 
</P>
<P>
	But the show's heart and head are in the right place, as Forde  
sees it. ``Mental Engineering'' tries to amuse while ensuring that 
advertising, which he considers the dominant propaganda of our 
time, gets the scrutiny it should. 
</P>
<P>
	``The head of one of the biggest advertising firms said the  
purpose of advertising is to get the consumer to live vicariously 
through the brand. ... That's saying, 'This is how we want to get 
people to spend their lives,' '' Forde said. ``That's got a lot of 
gravity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He turns to a text, ``How Advertising Works,'' published by Sage  
Publications, to make another point. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's well documented that the function of advertising is to  
increase your satisfaction with the brand you're already using. 
It's about deepening your rut,'' Forde says. 
</P>
<P>
	He himself is definitely anti-rut.  
</P>
<P>
	Forde, 41, passed on a career as a psychologist after deciding  
media would be a better fit. He was encouraged by the press 
secretary to U.S. Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., who advised Forde 
he could be ``the liberal Rush Limbaugh.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a brief stint as an on-air intern with a Twin Cities radio  
talk show -- ``All hostile, all the time,'' jokes Forde -- he signed 
up in 1997 for a class in public access TV. In short order, he 
produced 18 episodes of ``Mental Engineering'' on a shoestring. 
</P>
<P>
	Encouraged by the response, Forde gambled his life savings (with  
his wife's blessing) to make 13 new, slicker episodes. The series 
is airing on PBS stations in cities including Los Angeles, San 
Francisco, Chicago, Detroit, Buffalo, N.Y., Seattle, Washington 
D.C., Denver, Omaha, Neb., Indianapolis and New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	He's searching for funding to do more shows -- warning, however,  
that even underwriters may find their ads under the microscope. 
(Network options beyond noncommercial PBS, of course, would be slim 
and none.) 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, Forde hopes that ``Mental Engineering'' will  
encourage viewers to think critically about the world in general, 
beyond advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our mission is to model the art and the habit of asking good  
questions, and to do this through this tangible, vivid thing 
(advertising),'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	My, my. Who could have guessed TV commercials would be the  
subject of rigorous intellectual analysis? 
</P>
<P>
	``By whom?'' Forde responds, chortling. A salesman to the very  
end. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Dennis Lingers Off N.C. for 3rd Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAGS HEAD, N.C. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Dennis hung off North  
Carolina's Outer Banks for a third day Thursday and kept pounding 
away at the coast with 14-foot waves and 45 mph gusts, doing more 
damage to the beach than a single blow from a big hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is immensely worse as far as damage to the shoreline and  
beachfront retreat,'' said Orrin Pilkey, a Duke University coastal 
geologist. Although a hurricane can be deadly because it can blow 
down buildings, it typically ``goes across the islands very 
quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The assault on the North Carolina coast has been going on since  
early Monday. Dennis first battered the shoreline as a hurricane, 
then headed out to sea and weakened. But within a day, it was 
backtracking toward the Outer Banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The toll was evident everywhere on Hatteras Island, where wind  
and waves flung beach dunes onto the main highway and chewed up the 
asphalt. Abandoned trucks, some overturned, were half-buried in 
sand near the road. 
</P>
<P>
	The highway, N.C. 12, was expected to partially reopen late  
Thursday, but it will be several weeks before it can be rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's beyond the crisis stage,'' state Public Safety Secretary  
Richard Moore said. ``There are places where there are no dunes at 
all, and if you try to just throw blacktop down, you're throwing 
your money away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As far away as Florida, huge waves generated by Dennis stripped  
sand from newly refurbished beaches, popped planks out of fishing 
piers and flooded beachfront condos. 
</P>
<P>
	Waves lapped 20 feet away from where the Cape Hatteras  
Lighthouse used to stand, 150 feet from the Atlantic. It was moved 
in July to keep it from toppling into the sea and now sits 1,600 
feet from the surf. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of reassuring to see the light safely away from  
the waves,'' Moore said. A relighting ceremony planned Saturday at 
the 208-foot lighthouse, the nation's tallest, was postponed 
because of the weather. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11p.m. EDT, Dennis, which was downgraded from a hurricane  
late Tuesday, was 125 miles southeast of Cape Hatteras, drifting 
slowly to the south-southwest. A tropical storm warning remained in 
effect from Cape Lookout, N.C., to the Virginia border. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Blaes of the National Weather Service said Dennis would  
probably continue to drift slowly to the west and southwest for the 
next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Erosion experts compare Dennis to a nor'easter, the winter storm  
that does not pack a hurricane's wallop but stays longer, making it 
worse for the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Outer Banks -- a thin, 130-mile strand of barrier islands  
-- the storm cut a trench Wednesday across a quarter-mile neck of 
Hatteras Island. But on Thursday, the breach had partly filled up 
with wind-blown beach sand. 
</P>
<P>
	With road crews working to clear a path through drifted sand and  
standing water, National Guard convoys managed to reach villages on 
the southern end of Hatteras with food and supplies. Power and 
water service were restored to much of the island, but the phones 
still were down. 
</P>
<P>
	Electric power also was restored on Ocracoke Island, which had  
operated for days on generator power. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Touhey, owner of the Island Inn and Restaurant on Ocracoke,  
said that islanders are calling this the worst flooding since 
Hurricane Gloria in 1985. With every high tide, the island floods 
again, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't come back like it did the night of the hurricane,  
but there's just high water everywhere,'' he said, and 
``everybody's walking around in rubber boots or waders, or 
something just to get around.''

<HEADLINE> Top Florida Court Upholds Term Limits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida voters knew what they were  
doing when they changed the constitution to limit state politicians 
to eight years in office, the state Supreme Court said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The high court's decision to uphold the term limits amendment  
means more than a third of the Legislature's 160 members will be 
barred from seeking re-election in November 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Term limits also apply to the state's six elected Cabinet  
officers. The governor was already limited to two successive 
four-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Five people challenged the amendment, approved by 77 percent of  
voters in 1992, saying voters were really seeking to oust career 
politicians in Congress -- not state officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the attention at that time was focused on Washington,  
they argued, and voters were persuaded to approve the amendment 
because of disgust with federal lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	After the U.S. Supreme Court threw out federal term limits, the  
five voters challenged the remaining term limits on state 
politicians. They argued that voters never meant to deprive 
themselves of the right to vote repeatedly for their state 
representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida court, in an unsigned, unanimous opinion, wrote that  
the challengers ``failed to establish that the voters' purpose ... 
was only to limit terms of federal officeholders and the voters 
would not have approved the term limits amendment if only state 
officeholders had been included.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The challengers also claimed the amendment was unfair to rural  
voters who don't have as much representation in the Legislature as 
urban residents who have large delegations. The court also rejected 
that claim.

<HEADLINE> Bird's Future With Pacers Unclear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Larry Bird never promised the Indiana Pacers  
he would coach more than three years. 
</P>
<P>
	And that means the Hall of Famer's plans are unclear after next  
season. Bird could stay with the team beyond that, although it 
might put Donnie Walsh out of a job. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the end of his contract,'' Walsh, the team's president,  
said Wednesday. ``He hasn't come in and definitely told me that, 
but I've always known it was a three-year deal, and at the end of 
it he was going to make up his mind whether he wanted to coach or 
not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh's comments came a day after it was disclosed the  
42-year-old coach has had periodic bouts of irregular heartbeat. 
Bird is watching his diet and taking medication to treat atrial 
fibrillation, which is not life threatening. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird was not available for comment Wednesday, and it was not  
clear if the possibility of his leaving coaching was tied to his 
heart condition. 
</P>
<P>
	When he came to the Pacers in 1997, he acquired a minority  
ownership of the team and said he didn't expect to coach long. 
Walsh said he would step aside if Bird wants his job in the front 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd talk to the owners about that, I'd talk to Larry about  
that,'' Walsh said. ``If the best thing would be for me to leave 
the team, I'd leave the team. But we haven't really gotten into 
that yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bird first experienced heart trouble late in his career with the  
Boston Celtics, and Walsh said he knew about the condition when he 
hired Bird in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``In effect, it was a matter of finding the level of the  
medicine in order to have his heart beat regularly. Once they found 
that, it seemed to me it was OK and he didn't have any more 
problems,'' Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston Globe reported Wednesday that Bird indicated to Walsh  
the 1999-00 season would be his last as coach. Walsh told The 
Associated Press he never talked to Bird specifically about that, 
although he has been aware of that possibility all along. 
</P>
<P>
	``In dealing with Larry for the last two years, from the very  
beginning, he only committed to coach for three years,'' Walsh 
said. ``But he's going to coach this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've also spoken to him about continuing on as general  
manager, president, whatever you want to call it. So we'll continue 
to talk about that. But we really haven't sat down and had a 
definite discussion about this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bird, who had never coached basketball at any level, was the NBA  
coach of the year in his first season with Indiana in 1998, when 
the Pacers were a franchise-record 58-24 and reached the Eastern 
Conference finals. Last season, shortened to 50 games by the league 
lockout, the Pacers were 33-17, won the Central Division 
championship and again reached the conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Bird's heart ailment was disclosed in an excerpt in this week's  
Sports Illustrated from his upcoming book, ``Bird Watching: On 
Playing and Coaching the Game I Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I always knew there was something wrong with my heart,'' Bird  
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would feel sudden exhaustion and his heart would  
start ``jumping around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bird was put on medication and told to exercise, eat healthy and  
drink alcohol only in moderation. But his condition worsened in the 
spring of 1997, right before he became the Pacers' coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a little scared because it didn't seem like it was going  
away,'' Bird wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	His condition is not as serious as ventricular fibrillation,  
which doctors believed caused the death of former Celtics teammate 
Reggie Lewis.

<HEADLINE> Worker Jailed for Psychic Calls </HEADLINE>

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Cheryl Burnham's psychic should have seen it  
coming. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Burnham, a clerk at a juvenile facility, got 30 days in jail  
Thursday for ringing up a $120,000 tab on her employer to a psychic 
hotline. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Burnham pleaded no contest to felony grand theft for placing  
2,500 calls on county telephones to the psychic hotline in the 
Dominican Republic. She was facing more than four years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're in the throes of addiction, sometimes you convince  
yourself that things don't cost as much as they do,'' said Deputy 
District Attorney Rob Dver. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Burnham, 39, was ordered to pay $97,972.97 in restitution.  
She is to begin her jail sentence Sept. 15.

<HEADLINE> Cell Phone-Driving Ban Enforced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLYN, Ohio (AP) -- Police have started ticketing drivers for  
chatting on cell phones in this Cleveland suburb under a law 
believed to be the first of its kind in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Police had been warning drivers since the ordinance was passed  
in March. But on Wednesday, police started handing out tickets to 
those using hand-held cell phones. 
</P>
<P>
	Fines for the misdemeanor start at $3 for first-time offenders,  
but can shoot up to $100 for a second offense or if the driver is 
involved in an accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The law prohibits use of a cell phone while driving unless both  
hands are on the steering wheel. Exceptions are made for emergency 
calls, using a phone in a parked car or using a speakerphone. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea for the ordinance began when Mayor John Coyne learned  
that an accident near a city recreation center was caused by an 
inattentive driver talking on a cell phone. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're telling people is that if you're going to give the  
gift of gab, get to the side of the road,'' Coyne said. 
</P>
<P>
	David Cleary, 35, of Arlington Heights, Ill., was one of the  
first drivers to be ticketed. Although he was surprised at being 
pulled over, he understood the reasoning. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it makes the road safer, that's good,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	A 1997 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine  
found that talking on a phone while driving quadrupled the risk of 
an accident and was almost as dangerous as being drunk behind the 
wheel. 
</P>
<P>
	According to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  
statistics, cell phones were a contributing factor in 57 fatal 
crashes in 1997, the last year for which figures are available. 
</P>
<P>
	Several countries have banned the use of cell phones while  
driving. Jeffrey Nelson, a spokesman for the Cellular 
Telecommunications Industry Association, said he believes 
Brooklyn's law is the first of its kind in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooklyn has a history of leading the way in traffic safety.  
Coyne, 82, who has been mayor since 1948, helped to enact a 
seat-belt requirement in 1966. He said that law was also the first 
of its type. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Coyne thinks he can stop people from talking while  
driving, he acknowledged that the habit might be hard to break. 
</P>
<P>
	``A friend of mine called me up and told me the guy ahead of him  
had been talking on his cell phone for about six miles,'' Coyne 
said. ``So I asked my friend where he was calling me from. He hung 
up.''

<HEADLINE> Kiwi Trustee Seeks Liquidation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Barred from the skies since March, the end  
of the road is now in sight for Kiwi International Air Lines after 
seven turbulent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Its bankruptcy trustee on Thursday requested court permission to  
sell its few remaining assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless a buyer surfaces in the next few weeks, trustee Charles  
A. Stanziale Jr. said he expects liquidation would be approved 
later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts over the past several months to find a buyer proved  
fruitless. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've talked to dozens of people who expressed interest,  
initial interest, and who for various reasons decided this wasn't 
for them. I reached out every place I could,'' Stanziale said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiwi, now in its second bankruptcy, struggled since its founding  
in 1992 by airline employees who had lost their jobs at other 
carriers, mostly Pan Am and Eastern. The founders chose the name of 
a flightless bird for their employee-owned enterprise to symbolize 
the loss of their wings at their old airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	At its peak in the mid-1990s, the Newark-based airline had 1,200  
employees, 15 leased jets and flew 65 flights a day. Its 
destinations, at various times, included Atlanta, Bermuda, Boston, 
Chicago, Las Vegas, Puerto Rico, and Miami, Orlando, Tampa and Palm 
Beach in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kiwi was beset by debt and was shut down three times by  
regulators, although pilots proudly touted a safety record that 
``never scratched a wing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It emerged two years ago from its first bankruptcy when  
Baltimore surgeon Charles C. Edwards bought the airline and took 
majority ownership of the company from the employees. 
</P>
<P>
	A message left Thursday for Edwards, who oversaw the airline  
until Stanziale was named trustee, was not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiwi entered what now appears to be its death spiral in March,  
when the Federal Aviation Administration grounded it, saying it was 
unable to fly safely. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiwi declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy, hoping to reorganize, and  
laid off nearly all of its 500 workers and surrendered its four 
leased jets. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA in April changed the revocation to a suspension, giving  
Kiwi time to find a rescuer. Pan Am Airways had offered to buy Kiwi 
in March for $3 million, but that plan collapsed when Kiwi could 
not immediately regain its flight certificate. 
</P>
<P>
	Papers filed Thursday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court here seek to  
convert the bankruptcy to Chapter 7, liquidation, claiming more 
than $20 million in debts.

	CLAIRTON, Pa. (AP) -- A 44-year-old workman was killed by a  
falling house Thursday in suburban Pittsburgh.

Pittsburgh along Pennsylvania Route 51.

said. ``Then someone really was screaming they were missing 
somebody and somebody was underneath and it was one of the

<HEADLINE> 53 Deaths in Heart Drug Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A study of an experimental drug to treat  
congestive heart failure was halted earlier this year after 53 
patients taking the medication died in the first six months, drug 
maker Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	There were nearly twice as many deaths among patients taking the  
drug than among patients taking a placebo, Lilly said. 
</P>
<P>
	A different formulation of the Lilly drug is sold under the name  
Cynt, and used in Europe and Asia to treat high blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Indianapolis-based Lilly was studying the drug, a form of  
moxonidine, with Solvay SA, a Belgium firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The clinical trial, in which the drug was to be tested on at  
least 4,000 patients, began in August 1998 and was supposed to last 
two years. The trial tested a sustained-release formulation of the 
drug, meaning it was designed to be absorbed into the body slowly. 
</P>
<P>
	But the trial was halted in February after 82 deaths-- of which  
53 had taken the drug and 29 took a placebo-- occurred among the 
first 2,000 patients who were enrolled. The study was being 
conducted at medical facilities around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly had said last March that the study was being halted, but  
did not provide details at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly spokesman Ed West said the deaths were unfortunate but not  
unusual considering the severity of the patients' illnesses. It's 
unclear whether the drug hastened the patients' deaths, West added. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is no longer studying the drug for congestive heart  
failure. 
</P>
<P>
	West said Lilly has not sought to get U.S. approval for Cynt  
because it does not have any advantages over existing high blood 
pressure pills on the market.

<HEADLINE> Four Suspended and Fined by AL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cleveland designated hitter David Justice,  
Anaheim pitcher Troy Percival, Toronto reliever Paul Spoljaric and 
Minnesota infielder Cristian Guzman were all suspended for three 
games and fined $500 Thursday by the American League. 
</P>
<P>
	Percival and Guzman appealed the penalties, which were to begin  
Friday. Justice will decide Friday whether he will appeal. 
Spoljaric began serving his penalty Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Percival hit Justice with a pitch Tuesday night after the  
Indians rallied from an eight-run deficit in the eighth inning. 
Justice charged the mound and flung his helmet and hit the Anaheim 
reliever. Spoljaric was ejected Tuesday night for throwing at 
Guzman, who also charged. 
</P>
<P>
	For the players appealing, no penalty can start until after AL  
president Gene Budig holds a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice, who had never been thrown out of a game in his career  
before Tuesday night's brawl, said he was afraid Budig would give 
him a stiffer penalty because of the helmet throwing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it might be more,'' Justice said Thursday night  
before the Indians played the Angels. ``When I heard three, I 
thought, that's not too bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove was also expecting Justice to be  
handed a longer suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was surprised it was only three days, but I've very  
thankful,'' Hargrove said. ``I think it was the right decision.''

<HEADLINE> Workers Contaminated With Plutonium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Seven workers face weeks of medical  
monitoring after they were contaminated with plutonium at a federal 
nuclear weapons facility. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the Savannah River Site, on the Georgia-South  
Carolina border, said particles of the radioactive metal were found 
on the workers' clothing and skin, but they have not determined 
whether the plutonium penetrated the workers' bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident occurred Wednesday while the seven were repackaging  
plutonium in a storage area, said Frank Jordan, a vice president 
for the site's main contractor, Westinghouse Savannah River Co. An 
eighth worker in the area was not contaminated. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers, who have been assigned to work in nonradioactive  
areas, must wait for results of numerous urine and fecal tests over 
the next four to six weeks to learn whether they inhaled or 
swallowed the metal. Even in relatively small doses, plutonium can 
cause cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have not determined why the area was contaminated.  
Westinghouse and Energy Department officials said they will 
investigate the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	An average of four SRS employees per year are found to have  
radioactive contamination on their skin, and about 60 each year are 
found to have contaminated clothing, Fran Williams, a Westinghouse 
vice president, said.

<HEADLINE> Indian Tensions Rise in So. Dakota </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINE RIDGE, S.D. (AP) -- It's been nearly three months since two  
Sioux men were found slain in a culvert near the Nebraska line, and 
many Indians doubt authorities even care whether they solve the 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, some Indian activists say the apparent standstill in  
the investigation only confirms their suspicion that white Nebraska 
lawmen helped kill Wilson Black Elk Jr. and Ronald Hard Heart or 
helped cover up the crime to make it seem as if Indians were 
responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just two dead Indians to them,'' Tom Poor Bear, who was  
Black Elk's half-brother and Hard Heart's cousin, said of the FBI. 
``If these were two white people who were murdered, this place 
would be swarming with FBI agents. They'd be turning over every 
blade of grass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deaths have led to a violent protest and heightened  
long-standing tensions between whites and the Oglala Sioux from the 
poor and desolate Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI says it is doing all it can. And the sheriff's  
department in Sheridan County, Neb., denies having any role in the 
killings or discriminating against Indians. But those statements do 
little to diminish the distrust on the reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	In a measure of how deep the distrust runs, the Sioux who  
believe white deputies were involved in the slaying can't cite any 
direct evidence. They believe the men were killed in Nebraska and 
their bodies were dumped on the reservation to make it seem as if a 
tribe member did it. But investigators have not said whether the 
bodies were moved. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the bad feelings are left over from the American Indian  
Movement's 1973 armed takeover of a trading post at nearby Wounded 
Knee in a protest over the government's handling of complaints 
about Indian affairs. In 71 days of unrest, two Indians were killed 
and a deputy marshal was wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Distrust of law officers also run high on South Dakota's eight  
other reservations, where unemployment often is staggering and 
alcoholism widespread. 
</P>
<P>
	In Mobridge, S.D., just across the Missouri River from the  
Standing Rock Sioux Indian Reservation, Indians have rallied to 
protest the way authorities have handled the death earlier this 
summer of Robert ``Boo'' Many Horses, 22, whose body was found 
face-down in a garbage can. 
</P>
<P>
	The autopsy found that Many Horses died of alcohol poisoning.  
Four white teen-agers who were drinking with him the night he died 
have been charged -- one with manslaughter, for allegedly stuffing 
him in the can. 
</P>
<P>
	Indians are angry that the defendants are free as they await  
trial, while three Indians accused of severely beating a white man 
near Pine Ridge in August were denied bail. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is deep-rooted racism in South Dakota, and it can't be  
denied,'' said Alfred Bone Shirt, who is on the Lakota Nation Human 
Rights Committee. Lakota is the name some Sioux call themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Indians have held a series of protests over both the Pine Ridge  
slayings and alcohol sales in tiny Whiteclay, Neb., where a few 
stores do a brisk business selling beer and booze to Sioux. Alcohol 
is banned at Pine Ridge, just two miles from Whiteclay. 
</P>
<P>
	During the first march, in June, several people attacked a  
store, threw soda, cigarettes and other items into the street, and 
set fires in the building. 
</P>
<P>
	Before a rally the following week, the town's 22 residents were  
evacuated, and 100 troopers met the marchers in riot gear. Several 
demonstrators were arrested for crossing a police line. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after, a group of Indians set up tents and tepees at ``Camp  
Justice,'' near a grove of stunted elm trees on a hill overlooking 
the spot where the bodies were found. Poor Bear and about a dozen 
others have vowed to stay there until the crime is solved. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I want to do is have my brother rest in peace,'' said  
Edward Hard Heart. ``Right now his spirit is wandering around, and 
he won't rest until we find out who killed him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few details of the investigation have emerged. The FBI has shown  
autopsy results to the families but said releasing the results 
publicly might compromise the investigation. Poor Bear, who helped 
identify Black Elk's body, said the man was severely beaten. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Vukelich, the FBI agent overseeing the investigation, said  
his agency and tribal police are making every effort to find who 
killed the men. A $15,000 reward for information has been offered. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because these remain in the unsolved category, they receive  
the highest priority,'' Vukelich said. ``I disagree that we're not 
doing all we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vukelich would not say whether Sheridan County law officers are  
being investigated. ``We are investigating all angles of this 
case,'' he said. ``That includes anybody who had any involvement in 
the crime scene.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheridan County Sheriff Terry Robbins said his department played  
no role in the deaths. As for allegations of racism, he said: ``I 
have no idea why that sentiment is there, other than we have a 
large influx of Native Americans into our county and there is a 
number of them arrested. We try to treat everybody as equals, no 
matter what race, color or creed.''

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices Plunge As Demand Weakens  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Natural gas futures took their steepest dive of the year  
Thursday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, sent tumbling by a 
report reflecting weakened demand as summer ends. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline and other energy prices also fell. In other markets,  
palladium advanced sharply, boosted by strong sales in the 
automobile industry which uses the metal heavily, and pork bellies 
retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas had its worst one-day decline since last December,  
dropping by nearly 10 percent on data showing that U.S. inventories 
are greater than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Gas Association reported late Wednesday that U.S.  
natural gas stocks rose 69 billion cubic feet last week to 2.521 
trillion cubic feet. Analysts had expected an increase of only 50 
billion cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Natural gas really got clobbered,'' said Bill O'Grady, an  
energy analyst for AG Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. Louis, saying the 
dip was to be expected after a long rise in prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors also were reacting to the fact that September and  
October traditionally are low-demand months for natural gas -- 
sandwiched between high summer demand for cooling and high winter 
demand for heating. 
</P>
<P>
	With the approach of the Labor Day weekend signaling Americans'  
traditional farewell to summer and high-mileage driving, gasoline 
futures also sank, taking crude prices with them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had pretty good numbers this week but they're probably the  
last batch of good numbers we'll get for quite awhile,'' O'Grady 
said of gasoline usage. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas for October delivery fell 26.6 cents to $2.471 per  
1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	October crude oil fell 50 cents to $21.49 a barrel; October  
heating oil fell 1.36 cents to 56.47 cents a gallon; October 
unleaded gasoline fell 2.07 cents to 63.51 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent Blend crude for October delivery fell  
31 cents to $20.80 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	Palladium prices hit a four-month high, boosted by bullish auto  
sales figures reported Wednesday by both General Motors and 
DaimlerChrysler. 
</P>
<P>
	GM said its August sales soared 64 percent over the same month a  
year ago, when it was recovering from a devastating strike, while 
DaimlerChrysler reported car and truck sales for August were 12 
percent higher than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Many car manufacturers use palladium in the manufacture of  
emission-control devices. 
</P>
<P>
	The metal's price also was buoyed Thursday by the dollar's  
weakening against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Since metals are dollar-based commodities, a rise in its value  
encourages selling to lock in profits. 
</P>
<P>
	December palladium futures rose $9.45 to $353.45 per ounce on  
the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork bellies fell the maximum 5 percent allowed on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. Analysts said prices were being pressured by 
rising pork production at a time when supplies already are 
plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
	February pork bellies fell 2.28 cents to 57.32 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Arkansas Charges 4 in Fetus Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Three young men hired by a pregnant  
woman's boyfriend kicked her in the belly and killed the baby, 
prosecutors said Thursday as they brought murder charges in the 
first test of Arkansas' new Fetal Protection Law. 
</P>
<P>
	The law, passed this year, makes it a crime to injure a fetus  
more than 12 weeks old. It allows exceptions for abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the law, prosecutors would have had to limit the charges  
to crimes against the pregnant woman, who was badly beaten. In this 
case, the boyfriend and the alleged assailants could receive the 
death penalty if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Shawana Pace, who was due to give birth any day, said she  
pleaded for the baby's life as she was kicked, choked and hit on 
Aug. 26. She said one of the attackers told her, ``Your baby is 
dying tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Pace, 23, saw her dead child and named the girl Heaven.  
</P>
<P>
	``She was a perfect baby, almost 7 pounds. It was like she was  
just sleeping,'' Ms. Pace said Thursday in her hospital room, where 
she was recovering from surgery to remove her spleen. She also 
suffered a broken left wrist, black eye and bruised face. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Pace, a junior studying psychology at the University of  
Arkansas at Little Rock, told police she believed the attack was 
set up by her boyfriend, Erik Bullock, 29. The assault occurred 
after she, her 5-year-old son and Bullock arrived at Bullock's 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Pace told police that Bullock had said he did not want  
children. The 5-year-old boy, who is not Bullock's son, was 
unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was afraid. He didn't want his parents to know'' about the  
pregnancy, Ms. Pace told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Bullock hired three of his friends -- Eric Beulah,  
20; Derrick Witherspoon, 17; and Lonnie Beulah, 15, all brothers 
from Pine Bluff -- to stage a robbery at his house. None of the 
suspects have made a court appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said all three later implicated Bullock in the attack.  
According to a police affidavit, Witherspoon said ``his brother 
Eric told him that Bullock wanted them to do something to Pace that 
would get rid of the baby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bullock and the three youths were charged with capital murder,  
which carries a sentence of life in prison or the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas is one of 26 states that, either through state laws or  
court precedents, allow prosecutors to bring charges in the death 
of a fetus. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we didn't have this statute at this time, we would be  
questioning whether or not the fetus is a person,'' prosecutor 
Melody Piazza said.

<HEADLINE> Ripken Hits 400th Homer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Cal Ripken hit his 400th career home run  
Thursday night, joining an exclusive circle of sluggers whose 
membership now stands at 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken connected off right-hander Rolando Arrojo in the third  
inning of the Baltimore Orioles' game against the Tampa Bay Devil 
Rays. The three-run homer, on a 1-1 pitch, landed in the left-field 
seats and set off a wild celebration at Camden Yards. 
</P>
<P>
	As Ripken rounded the bases, the scoreboard scrolled a list of  
all his home runs. He was greeted warmly by his teammates in the 
dugout, then came out and tipped his batting helmet to the standing 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd remained on their feet as the Devil Rays made a  
pitching change. Ripken used the delay to wave again to the 
appreciative crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	The shot, estimated at 372 feet, was his 16th homer of the  
season and first since July 25. He spent a month on the disabled 
list with nerve irritation in his lower back before being activated 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken returned from his second stint on the DL intent upon  
blocking out all thoughts about hitting No. 400 and moving closer 
to his 3,000th hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always try to downplay that,'' he said. ``The home runs, I'm  
tickled to death that I'm able to contribute and have that kind of 
success. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they come, they come and I'll be very happy about it. If  
they don't come, my career won't be any less fulfilling as a result 
of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he admitted to trying to hit one out in his last home game  
before going on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to hit a home run because I thought it would be great  
to do it here at home,'' he said. ``I was able to concentrate and 
put a good swing on the ball. But it seemed to take me out of my 
game a little bit, trying to swing hard and hit a home run every 
time. You can't hit a home run by swinging for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The home run gave Ripken 2,969 career hits. If he gets No. 3000,  
he will gain entry into an even tighter fraternity of hitters: 
those with 3,000 hits and 400 homers. 
</P>
<P>
	The only players to accomplish the feat are Hank Aaron, Willie  
Mays, Eddie Murray, Stan Musial, Dave Winfield and Carl 
Yastrzemski. Ripken and Yastrzemski would be the only ones on the 
list to play their entire career in the American League. 
</P>
<P>
	When it comes to durability, however, Ripken stands alone. His  
consecutive games streak of 2,632 games, which he voluntarily ended 
last season, is the longest such run in baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
	The 39-year-old Ripken hit his first homer on April 5, 1982,  
against Kansas City's Dennis Leonard. At the time, Ripken was 21. 
</P>
<P>
	He hit No. 100 off Texas' Dickie Noles on Aug. 15, 1985; No. 200  
on Aug. 21, 1989, against Milwaukee's Mark Knudson; and reached 300 
with a three-run shot against Milwaukee's Teddy Higuera on May 24, 
1994, at age 33. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken has homered against five Hall of Famers: Tom Seaver (3  
times); Don Sutton (3); Phil Neikro (2); Nolan Ryan (2); and 
Gaylord Perry (1).

<HEADLINE> Two Venezuelan Oil Executives Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Two more high-level executives  
resigned from Venezuela's powerful state oil monopoly on Thursday, 
following the company head's resignation in a dispute over 
production and management policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberto Mandini resigned Monday as president of Petroleos de  
Venezuela, the world's third largest oil company and one of the top 
two suppliers to the United States. He was replaced by company Vice 
President Hector Ciavaldini, a close ally of Venezuelan President 
Hugo Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez has said he wants to shake up Petroleos de Venezuela,  
which he has called a ``state within a state'' that enjoys an 
extravagant ``gold-card culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, a total of five executives have quit. including  
three vice-presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Antonio Marquez, communications director at Petroleos de  
Venezuela, and Antonieta Mendoza de Lopez, corporate affairs 
coordinator, are the latest to retire, a company official told Dow 
Jones Newswires. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez has moved to reverse a company policy aimed at expanding  
production, opting instead to reduce output in order to raise 
prices. Prices for Venezuelan oil hit a 12-year low last year but 
have more than doubled since February. 
</P>
<P>
	Some industry analysts said Chavez might endanger the company's  
reputation by filling key posts with people known more for their 
political loyalty than energy expertise. They said Ciavaldini had 
been promoted because of his political connections with Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
	Ciavaldini, a trained chemical engineer with a doctorate from  
the University of London, was appointed vice president of the 
company by Chavez in February.

<HEADLINE> Getting Cattle To Chew Their Kelp / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- Nobody has asked the cows, but Texas Tech  
researchers say a two-year research project indicates cattle might 
be better off chewing seaweed than grass. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers say cattle fed with seaweed meal are more  
resistant to disease, gain more weight and are more likely to be of 
a higher grade when their meat is processed and sold. 
</P>
<P>
	That could mean millions of dollars for farmers and ranchers,  
officials estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economic loss that infected grass has on beef, swine and  
dairy industries is an enormous problem,'' said Vivien Allen, a 
forage expert and agriculture professor at Texas Tech. 
</P>
<P>
	``Estimated losses to the beef industry alone due to fescue  
(grass) toxicity exceed $600 million annually. What we see is that 
the seaweed treatment has reversed some of the toxic effects of the 
infected fescue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study included more than 1,000 head of cattle that were fed  
either seaweed feed or common grass sprayed with seaweed extract. 
Any of the cattle that had previously contracted diseases from 
grass showed vast improvement, Ms. Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaweed contains high concentrations of vitamins A, D and E, but  
beyond that, researchers aren't exactly sure why it's good for 
cattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know it is good for people too, but like many things, we  
don't know why it is so good for disease prevention,'' Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranchers seemed skeptical but said they would give seaweed a try  
if it were available on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard of feeding cattle different types of forage, but  
seaweed?'' said Ray Herbert, a rancher near Dalhart. ``Seems like 
the cow would get a sick stomach. But I've tried strange things 
before and if the evidence is there and it was on the market, I'd 
try it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tech researchers say they discovered the benefits of seafeed by  
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, scientists working across the hall from Allen  
treated grass with different chemicals and extracts, trying to 
produce grass for golf courses that would resist disease and 
constant wear. Allen overheard them talking about the experiments. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen said she immediately realized the implications for cattle.  
</P>
<P>
	``Better grass means stronger animals,'' Allen said. ``First, we  
fed cattle grass treated with seaweed. Feeding the cattle seaweed 
was a big step and we were skeptical at first, but the results 
proved positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Pond, another researcher on the project, said a group of  
cattle who ate seaweed produced better cuts of meat then those fed 
hay. Better cuts are those with more fat evenly distributed 
throughout the meat, making it taste juicier and tastier, 
researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	``The quality grade appears to go up about a half grade in  
animals that have been seaweed-treated,'' Pond said. ``This 
translates into better beef, a benefit to both producers and 
consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The university has applied for a patent for producing seaweed  
feed and hopes to market it next year. The research has just been 
released for peer review.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky's Dad Asked To Aid Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's defense fund has played on  
the sentiments of many a Democratic sympathizer in an attempt to 
cover the Clinton family's legal bills, but at least one 
prospective donor was left cold: Monica Lewinsky's father. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Lewinsky, a Beverly Hills doctor who has contributed to  
the Democratic Party over the years, recently received a request 
from the Clinton Legal Expense Trust asking for help in paying off 
the $10.5 million in legal expenses of Clinton and his wife, 
Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewinsky wrote ``Return to sender'' on the envelope, scrawling  
underneath, ``You must be morons to send me this letter!'' 
according to a Lewinsky family friend who asked not to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Essaye, the fund's executive director, said Wednesday  
that he couldn't confirm the form letter was sent to Lewinsky but 
assumes it was. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just one of those things that happens,'' Essaye said.  
``I'm sorry to burden him with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fund mails its donation requests to lists of people  
recommended by a direct mail group, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's possible the same group is working with the Democratic  
National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than a month ago, Lewinsky's friend said, the DNC sent the  
father of the former White House intern a photograph of Clinton and 
Mrs. Clinton with a fund-raising plea and the message, ``Thank you 
for your understanding during the last year.''

<HEADLINE> Duquesne Reinstates 2 Hoops Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Duquesne reinstated two basketball players  
suspended earlier this summer after being indicted on federal 
charges in an alleged check and credit card fraud case. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon Ogunlesi and Jamal Hunter were suspended in June pending  
the outcome of their case. They were reinstated even though their 
court cases have not yet been tried. 
</P>
<P>
	The players pleaded innocent in June to charges they helped  
orchestrate a conspiracy that defrauded PNC Bank of nearly $36,000. 
Ten people, most of them Duquesne students, were named in the 
indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the charges, those involved bought and sold  
personal checks and debit cards, then used them to secure funds 
from bank accounts and purchase money orders. 
</P>
<P>
	The players were reinstated by the Rev. Sean Hogan, Duquesne's  
vice president of student life, ``pending the resolution of their 
legal matters,'' according to athletic director Brian Colleary. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kids know they're getting a second chance,'' Colleary  
said. ``Everybody makes mistakes. We felt it was prudent to give 
them a second chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ogunlesi, a 6-foot-11 transfer from Villanova, and Hunter, a 6-5  
forward originally recruited by Loyola, Md., have yet to play for 
Duquesne, which went 5-23 last season.

a higher grade when their meat is processed and sold. 
</P>
<P>
	That could mean millions of dollars for farmers and ranchers,  
officials estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economic loss that infected grass has on beef, swine and  
dairy industries is an enormous problem,'' said Vivien Allen, a 
forage expert and agriculture professor at Texas Tech. 
</P>
<P>
	``Estimated losses to the beef industry alone due to fescue  
(grass) toxicity exceed $600 million annually. What we see is that 
the seaweed treatment has reversed some of the toxic effects of the 
infected fescue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study included more than 1,000 head of cattle that were fed  
either seaweed feed or common grass sprayed with seaweed extract. 
Any of the cattle that had previously contracted diseases from 
grass showed vast improvement, Ms. Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaweed contains high concentrations of vitamins A, D and E, but  
beyond that, researchers aren't exactly sure why it's good for 
cattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know it is good for people too, but like many things, we  
don't know why it is so good for disease prevention,'' Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranchers seemed skeptical but said they would give seaweed a try  
if it were available on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard of feeding cattle different types of forage, but  
seaweed?'' said Ray Herbert, a rancher near Dalhart. ``Seems like 
the cow would get a sick stomach. But I've tried strange things 
before and if the evidence is there and it was on the market, I'd 
try it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tech researchers say they discovered the benefits of seafeed by  
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, scientists working across the hall from Allen  
treated grass with different chemicals and extracts, trying to 
produce grass for golf courses that would resist disease and 
constant wear. Allen overheard them talking about the experiments. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen said she immediately realized the implications for cattle.  
</P>
<P>
	``Better grass means stronger animals,'' Allen said. ``First, we  
fed cattle grass treated with seaweed. Feeding the cattle seaweed 
was a big step and we were skeptical at first, but the results 
proved positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Pond, another researcher on the project, said a group of  
cattle who ate seaweed produced better cuts of meat then those fed 
hay. Better cuts are those with more fat evenly distributed 
throughout the meat, making it taste juicier and tastier, 
researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	``The quality grade appears to go up about a half grade in  
animals that have been seaweed-treated,'' Pond said. ``This 
translates into better beef, a benefit to both producers and 
consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The university has applied for a patent for producing seaweed  
feed and hopes to market it next year. The research has just been 
released for peer review.

	VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) -- One of the world's leading  
ultra-triathletes was in a life-threatening condition today after 
he collapsed following an extreme two-day event during the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Vidmantas Urbonas, a 41-year-old Lithuanian, had damage to his  
heart, lungs and kidneys, probably due to the extreme exertion of 
the event, his doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're doing the best we can, but can't promise anything at  
this stage of his treatment,'' Antanas Vinkus, the hospital's 
director, told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Urbonas was hospitalized Sunday after completing a 52-mile run,  
the final stage of the three-race competition called the 
ultra-triathlon. Visibly in pain, he completed most of the race at 
a walk. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the competition, he completed a 223 mile bicycle race  
and swam 5 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, Urbonas, the 1998 world ultra-triathlon  
champion, gained attention for managing staggering physical feats. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, he swam the length of Lithuania's longest river,  
about 285 miles, despite doctors warnings that the week-long swim 
through the river's polluted waters could damage his health.

<HEADLINE>  Surreal Comedy Gets Buzz at Venice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VENICE, Italy (AP) -- You could hear a buzz in the air on Day 2  
of the Venice Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie generating the stir was a quirky, surreal comedy  
called ``Being John Malkovich,'' starring -- who else? -- John 
Malkovich, directed by Spike Jonze. 
</P>
<P>
	The film, which premiered Thursday, is Jonze's first feature  
film. But he already had a cult following thanks to a string of 
award-winning music videos for the Beastie Boys, Puff Daddy, Bjork 
and REM; commercials for Coca-Cola, Nike and Nissan; and short 
films featured at several festivals, including Sundance. 
</P>
<P>
	At first blush, Jonze seems an unlikely character to generate  
excitement. Despite the hip moniker, he's a short guy with a high, 
nasal voice who wears his fair hair brushed forward a la Bill 
Gates. 
</P>
<P>
	His real name isn't even Spike Jonze; it's Adam Spiegel. And his  
movie is, at heart, about wanting to be somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being John Malkovich,'' which also stars John Cusack, Cameron  
Diaz and Catherine Keener, is funny, original and almost impossible 
to explain. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the action takes place in the offices of the fictional  
Lester Corp. on the 7 1/2th floor of a New York office building with 
ceilings so low everyone walks around hunched over. To get there, 
you have to stop the elevator between two floors and use a crowbar 
to pry open the doors. 
</P>
<P>
	The office turns out to have a secret door, a portal into John  
Malkovich's head. Go through the door and -- presto! -- you're John 
Malkovich for 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The real John Malkovich says the story has very little to do  
with him. In fact, he joked at a standing-room-only news conference 
Thursday that being John Malkovich ``is less fun than you might 
imagine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the characters in the movie, however, being John Malkovich  
is a chance to realize their desires. These characters include a 
puppeteer played by Cusack, his wife, played by Diaz, and Cusack's 
vampish co-worker, played by Keener. There is also a chimpanzee 
with an ulcer and a 105-year-old man. 
</P>
<P>
	Malkovich first read the script, written four years ago by  
Charles Kaufmann, who had never even met Malkovich. 
</P>
<P>
	``I probably thought the title was a sort of one-line joke,''  
Malkovich said. ``Then I realized it was a 110-page joke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The movie pokes fun at a lot of things, including the sort of  
celebrity enjoyed by someone like Malkovich, whose credits include 
``Dangerous Liaisons,'' ``Of Mice and Men'' and ``Places in the 
Heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The movie also gets in licks on love, jealousy, gender, growing  
old and the effects of childhood trauma on chimps. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being John Malkovich'' is being screened at Venice in the  
``Dreams and Visions'' section of the festival, one of several 
showcases for fresh talent. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's festival, which ends Sept. 11, also features a new  
award: $100,000 and 20,000 yards of film to a first-time filmmaker.

<HEADLINE> Fraud Found in Food Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal and state officials are vowing to keep  
closer tabs on companies that supply meals to millions of children 
and adults at day-care centers after a lengthy investigation found 
providers funneling money into their own pockets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department's program provides about $1.7 billion  
annually to serve meals to about 2.4 million children and adults. 
But after a 2 1/2-year investigation called Operation Kiddie Care, the 
final audit released Wednesday by Inspector General Roger Viadero 
found severe problems. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, 44 people have been charged with defrauding the Child  
and Adult Care Food Program, and 28 have been convicted. The 
convictions resulted in orders for $18,000 in fines, $4.2 million 
in restitution and $1.1 million in forfeited assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Criminal activities included sponsors setting up fictitious  
day-care centers with fake names for children, putting no-show 
relatives on the payroll and extorting funds from legitimate 
day-care facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Shirley Watkins, undersecretary of agriculture, said failure to  
follow proper reporting procedures was to blame in some cases. But 
in cases that sparked criminal investigations in 14 states, she 
acknowledged that some providers simply were disreputable and must 
be removed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recognized we had some problems,'' she said. ``I'm  
committed to complying with this as aggressively as I need to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In California, which had 19 of the 44 criminal indictments,  
officials at the state Department of Education have reorganized 
their staff and are hiring five more auditors to keep closer watch 
over the providers. Officials also are going to start estimating 
where financial problems might crop up to catch them ahead of time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm totally committed to making improvements in our program so  
that these types of things are caught early on and that we deal 
severely with agencies that do commit fraud,'' said Glenn Ostapeck, 
who was hired as director of audits after federal investigators had 
completed most of their work. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the program, the federal government distributes funding to  
intermediaries, who are called sponsors. The sponsors spend part of 
the money for administrative costs and are supposed to pass along 
the rest to day-care centers for meals. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the worst cases, Kyung Ho Moon and Wan Hee Moon,  
husband-and-wife owners of Pacific Asian American Family Care Inc. 
in Long Beach, Calif., pleaded guilty to funneling payments to 
nonexistent workers and bogus businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Wan Hee Moon had spent a decade overseeing the program in  
Southern California as a manager at the state Department of 
Education. She was fired after being charged. 
</P>
<P>
	She was sentenced to three years in prison and her husband was  
given two years. They were ordered to pay $2.2 million in 
restitution, and they forfeited four properties, including a house 
that sold for $415,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In other cases, audits of years 1996 and 1997 revealed shoddy  
record-keeping and oversight that allowed problems to fester for 
years without required state-level audits.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Sign Deal for N.Y. House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. (AP) -- President Clinton and his wife signed a  
contract Thursday to buy a $1.7 million house in this New York City 
suburb, providing her the residency she needs to run for a U.S. 
Senate seat next year. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the Clintons will borrow  
$1.3 million from Bankers Trust Co. to purchase the five-bedroom 
house. The loan will be guaranteed in part by Terry McAuliffe, the 
president's friend and one of his chief fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
	The white, three-story wood frame home in the Westchester County  
town of Chappaqua was built in 1889 and features a swimming pool, 
five bedrooms, four bathrooms and two fireplaces. The top floor 
contains an exercise room. 
</P>
<P>
	The lot, just over an acre, is screened by evergreens at the end  
of a cul-de-sac called Old House Lane. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very pleased about the house, it's beautiful. We like it a  
lot'', Clinton told reporters as he left for an evening fund-raiser 
in Cazenovia, N.Y., for his wife's senatorial aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
	At $1.7 million, the Clintons agreed to pay slightly more than  
the list price of $1.695 million. They will pay about $26,000 a 
year in property taxes on their new residence, according to tax 
records. 
</P>
<P>
	``We appreciate everyone who helped make our search for a new  
home an enjoyable experience,'' the Clintons said in a statement 
issued while vacationing in upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The area offers plenty of golf courses and a predominantly  
Democratic town council. The town of 17,000 is known for excellent 
schools and beautiful houses. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is putting us on the map,'' said Bonnie Pactor, who lives  
a few streets away. 
</P>
<P>
	Other would-be neighbors worried that having a former president  
in residence would bring out the masses, like those in the stream 
of cars who stopped to look at the house this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a disaster,'' said Carol Thorsen, whose home is separated  
by a wooded area from the one the Clintons are considering. ``This 
town is too small. This is going to destroy the intimacy of the 
town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president and first lady will close on the house Nov. 1.  
``The Clintons will continue to live in the White House,'' Lockhart 
said. ``As with other presidents, this house will be their private 
home and they will spend as much time there as they can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the mortgage, McAuliffe -- a close friend of the  
president and his chief campaign fundraiser -- will put up $1.35 
million of his own money as collateral. The Clintons will make a 
down payment of $350,000, drawing on money from the blind trust 
established at the start of their presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said the home would be held in the names of both the  
president and first lady. They will have a five-year balloon 
mortgage which will adjust every six months, and after five years, 
they will have to pay off the loan or refinance it, he said. The 
beginning interest rate will be determined near the closing date. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton needs to establish residency in New York State by  
Election Day 2000 if she runs for the U.S. Senate seat being 
vacated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan. The first lady has yet to 
announce her candidacy officially. 
</P>
<P>
	Westchester County is a good choice if she runs, said Susan  
Tolchin, the county's director of communications. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are a county that is a microcosm of state of New York,''  
she said. ``For that reason, we're perfect for Hillary Clinton if 
she decides to run for Senate.... We are geographically located in 
a great place for a candidate who wants to run statewide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chappaqua, part of the town of New Castle, was originally  
settled by Quakers in the mid-1700s, said town historian Richard 
Neale. 
</P>
<P>
	New Castle became a town in 1791, separating from the town of  
North Castle when officials decided North Castle was too big. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took them too long to get from one end of town to the  
other, so they cut it in two,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chappaqua's topography made it a hard place to farm or  
overdevelop. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's rocky and hard to build here,'' Neale said. ``They had to  
make houses fit the character of the land.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To this day, the hamlet is mostly residential and there are few  
multiple-family dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
	Neale said he thought the Clintons will like living in  
Chappaqua. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only problem is, is the site they picked big enough to  
handle the operation?'' he asked. ``It's next to a main road, a 
handsome house but by no means a mansion.''

<HEADLINE> Republic New York Corp. Unit Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Republic New York Corp.'s securities unit is  
being investigated by federal prosecutors and bank regulators who 
are trying to determine whether assets were inflated in an 
investment fund that catered to Japanese investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The banking and financial services business has suspended James  
E. Sweeney, chief executive of Republic New York Securities Corp., 
and replaced the management of its futures trading division. 
</P>
<P>
	Worried investors sent shares of Republic New York down $7.18 3/4,  
or more than 10 percent, to $62.18 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republic has advised the relevant U.S. regulatory and law  
enforcement authorities and ... is working in full cooperation with 
them,'' the bank said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	State banking regulators and the U.S. Attorney's office declined  
to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Republic New York is in the process of being acquired by HSBC  
Holdings PLC of London for $10.3 billion. The investigation could, 
at the very least, delay the closing of the deal, according to 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
	While Republic New York would not name the client involved in  
the investigation, a person familiar with the investigation 
confirmed it is Princeton Global Management Co., a Princeton, N.J., 
investment fund popular with some large institutional investors in 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese investors may have placed as much as $1 billion in  
Princeton Global Management, according to a report today in The 
Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	The firm's phone number is unlisted, and executives could not  
immediately be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged errors were discovered in May by Japan's Financial  
Supervisory Agency, which searched the Tokyo offices of a Hong 
Kong-based brokerage called Cresvale International Ltd., which is 
an affiliate of Princeton Global Management, according to the 
person familiar with the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Supervisory Agency then contacted Republic New  
York and asked for information about the business between Princeton 
Global Management and Republic New York Securities. Republic said 
that led it to investigate and to contact U.S. authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	This is not the first run-in with regulators for Republic New  
York Securities or its CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Sweeney paid $25,000 to settle claims by the  
Securities and Exchange Commission that he violated ``soft dollar'' 
rules. Republic New York Securities paid $50,000 to settle related 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Soft dollar practices are arrangements under which stock  
brokerages provide investment managers free products or services, 
such as seminars and magazine subscriptions, and in exchange the 
investment manager funnels its trades to the stock brokerage.

<HEADLINE> Fleet, BankBoston Plan Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Department of Justice has approved a plan by  
Fleet Financial Group Inc. and BankBoston Corp. to sell off more 
than 300 bank branches to resolve antitrust concerns about their 
upcoming merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleet has been working to complete a takeover of BankBoston, and  
the approval of the Justice Department gets the plan over an 
important regulatory hurdle. 
</P>
<P>
	The two banks have agreed to sell $13.2 billion in deposits in  
306 branch offices in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island 
and Connecticut. The Justice Department said the sale was the 
largest divestiture in bank merger history. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said the branches will be sold to one large buyer,  
with the exception of 28 branches and $810 million in deposits that 
will go to small Massachusetts banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the agency did not identify the large buyer,  
Massachusetts Attorney General Tom Reilly said Sovereign Bancorp 
Inc. of Wyomissing, Pa., was working toward finalizing a deal with 
Fleet and BankBoston. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleet spokesman James Mahoney said that Thursday's decision set  
the stage for what he said would be a consumer-friendly 
divestiture. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the plan assures ongoing competition and choices for  
consumers in the New England market,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Mahoney nor representatives from BankBoston or Sovereign  
commented on reports that the Pennsylvania bank planned to move 
into New England. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing is official until it comes out on Sovereign Bancorp  
letterhead,'' said Missy Orlando, a Sovereign spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Sovereign Bancorp Inc. has $24.6 billion in assets and more than  
310 community banking and loan offices in eastern Pennsylvania, New 
Jersey and Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleet, the nation's ninth-largest bank, has $69.7 billion in  
deposits and $104.4 billion in assets. BankBoston, the country's 
15th-biggest bank, has $48.5 billion in deposits and $73.5 billion 
in deposits. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger, which would create the nation's eighth-largest bank,  
still needs the approval of the Federal Reserve Board.

<HEADLINE> Stars Defenseman Ludwig Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Dallas Stars defenseman Craig Ludwig  
has retired after 17 years in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a great ride, and I'm ready to step into another part  
of life,'' Ludwig said. 
</P>
<P>
	He told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram he will be a scout in the  
Stars' organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars had told him that he would not be offered a new  
contract for next season. He had talks with the Chicago Blackhawks 
and Detroit Red Wings about a contract to play another year, but he 
said he decided against joining another team because he felt he 
would be ``betraying'' the Stars. 
</P>
<P>
	So, he took the front-office job with the Stars.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think what it came down to was I really wanted to be a part  
of this organization and continue to build what they're building 
here,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old Ludwig played on two Stanley Cup champion teams,  
the 1986 Montreal Canadiens and last year's Stars.

<HEADLINE> Bengals Sign Leeuwenburg, Groce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Center Jay Leeuwenburg signed a one-year  
contract with the Cincinnati Bengals on Thursday, two days after he 
was released by the Indianapolis Colts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals also brought back fullback Clif Groce, whom they  
waived on Monday, by agreeing to a three-year contract. Fullback 
Nicky Sualua, who's been hampered by a strained knee ligament, 
agreed to an injury settlement and was waived. 
</P>
<P>
	Leeuwenburg, 30, was the Colts' most experienced offensive  
lineman. He started 37 consecutive games for the Colts and made 
every offensive snap last year for a line that allowed only 22 
sacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Leeuwenburg lost his job during training camp to second-year pro  
Larry Moore, prompting the Colts to release him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals have been trying to solidify their chronically weak  
offensive line and add to its depth. They added free agent guards 
Brian DeMarco and Matt O'Dwyer in the offseason and moved Rich 
Braham to center.

<HEADLINE> Suspect Arrested After Shootout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- A Boston man suspected of killing two  
women in a suburban Atlanta apartment was arrested Thursday after a 
shootout with police. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Pierce, 21, is accused of shooting his former girlfriend  
and her two friends who were in the Atlanta area attending college. 
The two friends died in the Aug. 26 shooting. The ex-girfriend, 
shot in the mouth, survived. 
</P>
<P>
	Police here met up with Pierce when they approached a parked car  
they believed was empty, checking it for a possible registration 
violation. When they got close, two men who had been lying down, 
sat up, said Brookline Police Chief Daniel C. O'Leary. 
</P>
<P>
	The car sped off. Police gave chase and when they surrounded the  
car, gunfire erupted. 
</P>
<P>
	One man got away. The other, Pierce, fired numerous shots at  
police before being hit in the leg, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pierce is accused of walking into an East Point apartment and  
shooting at the three 18-year-old Boston women, who were best 
friends and high school classmates. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrice Lassiter was killed. Monique Brown, who was to be a  
freshman at Clark Atlanta University, died Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The sole survivor, Shunae Allen, had been Pierce's girlfriend.  
She identified the suspect, who had studied at Morris Brown College 
in Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Europeans Recall Budweiser Bottles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Nearly six million bottles of Budweiser  
beer are being withdrawn from sale in 12 European countries because 
the bottles may break when opened, the company said today. 
</P>
<P>
	All twist-off top beer bottles in Spain, Portugal, Denmark,  
Sweden, Cyprus, Malta, Belgium, Netherlands, Latvia, Germany, and 
Switzerland were recalled, as well as many bottles in France, the 
company said. The recall began Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Budweiser bottles sold in the United Sates were not affected.  
</P>
<P>
	The 5.8 million bottles recalled were manufactured in Spain or  
Portugal, and filled at the company's Spanish brewery, said 
Anheuser-Busch's European director William McNulty. The bottles are 
marked as being best consumed before Aug. 15, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said that the top of some of the bottles is slightly  
larger than it should be, increasing the risk of breakage when they 
are opened. The company said it was alerted to the problem through 
customer complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12 countries affected account for 6 percent of the company's  
European sales, which are concentrated in Britain and Ireland, 
McNulty said. The recalled bottles represent less than 0.3 percent 
of Anheuser-Busch sales in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Budweiser bottles sold in Ireland, Greece and Italy were not  
affected by the recall. Bottles produced in Britain were also 
unaffected, although a small number of bottles imported from Spain 
have been recalled, the company said.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Machinists Approve Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing Machinists went to work today with a  
freshly approved contract that union members say signals a new era 
of mutual respect between company management and hourly workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The pact won 86 percent approval Wednesday night, the highest  
ever for a Boeing contract, union negotiator Dick Schneider told a 
cheering crowd after the votes were tallied. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been invited on a great journey by (Boeing chairman)  
Phil Condit,'' Schneider said. ``That invitation was to take this 
company into the next century in partnership. ... We have 
accepted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 26,842 to 4,328, with a 71 percent turnout from the  
44,000 members of the International Association of Machinists and 
Aerospace Workers in Washington, Oregon and Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Condit, who stepped in personally to end a prickly bargaining  
stalemate last weekend, lobbied hard for acceptance, telling union 
members the contract ``offers unprecedented job security, the best 
wages and retirement plan in the industry, and world-class 
benefits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Machinists interviewed outside polling places called the pact  
``a miracle'' and a morale-booster. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the climate in the business world right now, the  
competition with Airbus, the workers at Boeing got some recognition 
for their hard efforts,'' said Jeffrey Tazioli, who assembles wings 
for the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The old contract was to expire at 12:01 a.m. today. The  
Machinists went on strike over two of the last three contracts, 
most recently for 69 days in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing, the nation's No. 1 exporter, plans to deliver a record  
620 commercial planes this year. Meanwhile, a fierce rivalry with 
the European consortium Airbus Industrie has prompted a push to 
streamline operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The pressure to keep producing helped bring negotiators  
together. The company dropped its demands for a seven-day work week 
and more worker contributions to health-insurance premiums. It 
offered two annual wage increases of 4 percent and a third-year 3 
percent raise, as well as a 10 percent signing bonus worth $4,400 
to the average machinist. 
</P>
<P>
	``This contract was probably the best we've ever gotten,'' said  
Victor Hebert, a 737 quality inspector in Renton. 
</P>
<P>
	The only opposition to the agreement focused on retirement  
benefits and job security. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing offered a 25 percent increase in pensions, to $50 a month  
per year of service -- well below the 300 percent increase sought by 
the union. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract offer also guaranteed ``no layoffs as the direct  
result of subcontracting or offloading,'' but exempted ``commercial 
airplane strategic work placement requirements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders at the company and the union said the exemption covers  
work allocated to foreign workers as a condition of winning 
aircraft orders.

<HEADLINE> Suspects Held in Georgia Slaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- After being stripped, beaten with rocks and  
sticks and thrown down a ravine, 17-year-old Krystal Archer begged 
her three attackers to leave her alone. As she clung desperately to 
a tree, they set her hair on fire, pushed her down the ravine again 
and left her to die. 
</P>
<P>
	Battered and unable to walk, Miss Archer survived in the ravine  
for four days. But her attackers -- including her boyfriend -- 
returned again and again, each time hitting her with sticks and 
rocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, they returned to ``finish her off,'' police said,  
stabbing her several times and slitting her throat. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspects were identified as Timothy Curtis Cole, 21, and  
Michael Christopher Teal, 19, both of Covington, and Danielle 
Hubbard, 18, of Athens. They were arrested Tuesday night and were 
being held in Madison, about 50 miles east of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Madison County Sheriff Ken Pritchett said Thursday that one of  
the men, whom he would not identify, confessed to stabbing Miss 
Archer and slitting her throat. 
</P>
<P>
	The three were charged with felony murder and aggravated assault  
after Miss Archer's boyfriend, Cole, led authorities to the crime 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Pritchett, the sheriff's brother and deputy chief, said  
Teal and Miss Hubbard were dating and Cole and Miss Archer were 
dating. Miss Hubbard thought Miss Archer was ``eyeing her 
boyfriend,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The violence began when the two females began fighting in the  
woods. The fight escalated and the two men became involved. Over 
the next three or four hours, Miss Archer was stripped and forced 
to commit various acts, including sexual acts to her own body, 
Pritchett said. 
</P>
<P>
	She was hit with rocks and sticks. Three times, they threw her  
about 20 feet down into the ravine, which has about 2 feet of 
water. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was completely unclothed holding a small tree, begging  
them to leave her alone,'' Pritchett said. ``That's when one of 
them walked up and lit her hair on fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the third time, Miss Archer fell unconscious. The next day  
the three returned and found Miss Archer alive but unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
	``They beat her again with sticks and rocks and piled brush on  
top of her so she wouldn't be found,'' Pritchett said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Miss Archer's attackers returned on the third day, they  
threw rocks into the ravine, trying to hit her in the head and 
``finish her off,'' Pritchett said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the fourth day they returned with a butcher's knife from Miss  
Hubbard's parents' house. Miss Archer was still alive -- and awake. 
She had dragged herself about 15 yards and propped herself up. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the men stabbed her five or six times in the chest and  
neck and then slit her throat, Pritchett said.

<HEADLINE> ESPN Celebrates Milestone Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	George Grande vividly remembers the night ESPN made its debut.  
He had a one-day contract, and with all the emotion and 
difficulties that occurred, Grande wasn't sure he wanted to return. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Sept. 7, 1979, and Grande co-anchored the first show with  
Lee Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was unbelievably chaotic and there were plenty of technical  
problems,'' Grande said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Ley would join the cast two days later. Chris Berman wasn't  
tossing out nicknames for another three weeks. And Dan Patrick was 
nearly a decade away of coming aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were just looking for someone to anchor the first show  
and they offered me a full-time job after the first weekend,'' 
Grande said. ``It really wasn't a difficult decision for me because 
it was something that everyone dreamed of -- an all-sports 
network.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cable network's 20th anniversary is Tuesday, and it will air  
a three-hour special at 7 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	Grande ended up staying for 10 years, until he left to pursue a  
play-by-play career in baseball. He started with the Yankees and 
now works the Cincinnati Reds broadcasts for rival Fox Sports Net. 
</P>
<P>
	He still watches ``SportsCenter'' but more often than not, he  
turns off the sound. 
</P>
<P>
	``I watch for the highlights,'' Grande said. ``There's too much  
clutter now. I don't want to see a 30-second lead-in that has 18 
clever phrases. It seems like every anchor is just trying to outdo 
each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The emphasis placed on entertainment isn't the only change  
that's been made at ESPN through the years. 
</P>
<P>
	When Grande and Ley started, there was no TelePrompTer -- which  
feeds lines to the anchors. They had to do each show -- and they 
each did two per night and numerous updates -- with far less 
preparation than what goes on now. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't have the TelePrompTer until 1985 and it made us damn  
good broadcasters and forced us to really know our stuff because we 
had to ad-lib a lot,'' Ley said. ``But it hindered us because we 
couldn't put a lot of time into writing'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Grande left Bristol, Conn., in 1989, there was just ESPN.  
Now there are three more cable channels with the ESPN name, a 
magazine, a Web site and even a restaurant chain. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 1.4 million people subscribed to ESPN 20 years ago. Now  
more than 76 million can get the all-sports network. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anyone tells you they knew this would happen, they'd be  
lying,'' Ley added. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MAYNE MAN?:* When Kenny Mayne was called into the office of  
ESPN vice president-managing editor Bob Eaton, he was hoping for a 
raise. Instead, Mayne got a demotion -- and he's not quite sure why. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayne has worked with Dan Patrick for the past two years on the  
11 p.m. ``SportsCenter,'' the network's highest-profile show. 
</P>
<P>
	But Patrick's load has decreased now that he is host of a radio  
show, and Mayne's the big loser in the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayne has switched to the 1 a.m. ET slot most of the time -- and  
he will also work Friday and Saturday's 11 p.m. show -- while 
Patrick, Stuart Scott, Rich Eisen and Linda Cohn rotate at 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I was being called down for a pay raise or minor  
critiquing,'' Mayne said of being told of the demotion. ``I was 
kind of floored and didn't have much of a response. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like I'm bitter, though. Just disappointed.''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HERE FOR NOW:* Former Auburn coach Terry Bowden was supposed to  
face Florida State and his father, Bobby, in the first ever 
father-son college football matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	But Terry quit the Tigers job in the middle of last season and  
is now ABC's studio analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of Terry facing his father, it will be another brother  
making history. Tommy Bowden, the new coach at Clemson, will play 
his father Oct. 23 -- and if all goes well for Florida State, a win 
against his son would give Bobby his 300th victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Dad's 7-0, I'll root for him,'' Terry said. ``But if Dad  
has lost one and Tommy's doing well, I'll be on his side.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TUBE BITS:* ESPN unveils a new lineup and the yellow first-down  
line Thursday night. Lee Corso and Kirk Herbstreit will call the 
Oregon-Michigan State game along with Mike Tirico. ... Lou Holtz 
makes his debut as South Carolina coach Saturday at 7:30 p.m. EDT 
on ESPN. ... The first-ever NFL/Comic Relief Celebrity Golf 
Shootout is Sunday at 4 p.m. EDT on Fox. ... ESPN's one-hour early

<HEADLINE> Online Kidney Auction Stopped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The bidding for a human kidney offered on  
the Internet auction site eBay hit $5.7 million before the company 
put a stop to it Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Kevin Pursglove said eBay stopped the auction because  
the seller broke eBay's rules outlawing the sale of body parts. 
Selling your own organs is also illegal under federal law, a felony 
punishable by up to five years in prison or a $50,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you have an open trading environment with almost 6  
million registered users, you're likely to see somebody who tries 
to bend the rules, or to pull a prank on their fellow users,'' 
Pursglove said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seller, identified as ``hchero'' from Sunrise, Fla., started  
the bidding at $25,000 on Aug. 26. A message sent to his e-mail 
address was not immediately answered. 
</P>
<P>
	The description read: ``Fully functional kidney for sale. You  
can choose either kidney. Buyer pays all transplant and medical 
costs. Of course only one for sale, as I need the other one to 
live. Serious bids only.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A second kidney auction was posted Thursday afternoon starting  
at $4 million and had not received any bids. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously these are pranks. We believe that due to the wording  
in the other one that that was a prank and we don't want to leave 
anything to chance,'' eBay spokeswoman Kristin Seuell said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Thomas Reardon, president of the American Medical  
Association, said he was taken aback when he heard about the kidney 
auction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wow. Well, first of all, I'd question the ethics of any doctor  
who would participate in that kind of transaction,'' Reardon said. 
``Second of all, it's illegal to sell organs in this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	eBay has no system to spot questionable offers, instead relying  
on users to notify the company, Pursglove said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We get items we have to take down on a fairly frequent basis.  
From time to time, we'll get a kidney or a liver,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, a group of engineers tried to auction themselves as  
``high-priced, professionally trained cybergeeks'' for $3.14 
million. The group stopped its own auction without explanation, but 
not before receiving a number of bids. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, San Jose-based eBay banned the sale of guns  
and ammunition on the site, after people tried selling a missile, a 
bazooka, a rocket launcher and other military weapons.

<HEADLINE> Britney Spears Misses Meeting Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Britney Spears had plane problems that kept her  
from 1,000 fans at an autograph session. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-year-old singer was scheduled to appear Wednesday but was  
grounded in Memphis. Some of the fans -- mostly teen-age girls -- had 
camped out overnight, and the first 250 to arrive were given 
wristbands that would have allowed them to meet Ms. Spears. 
</P>
<P>
	The festive mood turned sour when fans realized Ms. Spears  
wasn't going to appear. Fans who held signs with admiring slogans 
replaced them with ones that read, ``Britney, get a watch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Spears, whose ``...Baby One More Time'' album has sold more  
than 5 million copies, made an evening performance at the 
BankBoston Pavilion.

<HEADLINE> Ski Towns Competing for Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- Vail Resorts disdained deeply discounted,  
wildly popular buddy passes offered by Colorado resorts a year ago. 
But it isn't taking any chances this year. 
</P>
<P>
	After posting a 16.2 percent decline in ski traffic, which cost  
Vail its crown as the nation's busiest resort, company officials 
are offering deals like the buddy pass program. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in business was blamed on a dearth of early season  
snowfall. But, Bill Jensen, chief executive operating officer for 
Vail Mountain, acknowledged, ``Vail is not immune'' to pressures 
from discounted prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Major resorts from Aspen to Winter Park have decided to offer  
the buddy passes again this year, creating a competition that 
analysts say has no match in the leisure industry, with the 
exception of airline fares. 
</P>
<P>
	With this year's discounted programs, a day's skiing will be as  
cheap as $10 or less at some resorts. Berthoud Pass, a small resort 
about 50 miles west of Denver, will charge less on days when there 
isn't any fresh snow. 
</P>
<P>
	Vail is offering 10-day and 20-day passes, with limited  
restrictions, for $269 and $499 respectively, or $26.90 and $24.95 
per day. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Aspen, which once described itself as the Mercedes of ski  
resorts, is widely advertising discounted tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside Colorado, resorts are generally holding the line on  
ticket prices, with season passes typically in the $1,000 mark in 
many premier areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day I see something new,'' said Kip Pitou, executive  
director of Ski Utah. Denver area resorts ``seem to be eating each 
other up instead of going out to get the rest of the market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called buddy passes were introduced amid much fanfare a  
year ago, when Winter Park, 60 miles west of Denver, reduced season 
passes to about $200 apiece if four were purchased together. 
</P>
<P>
	The price equaled season lift ticket costs in the early 1970s,  
before the advent of high-priced, high-speed lifts. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time ever, Breckenridge last year edged out Vail,  
its sister resort, in skier days. 
</P>
<P>
	Jensen, who ran Breckenridge until being transferred to Vail a  
few weeks ago, noted Vail suffered not only from the price war, but 
from the publicity about October arson fires allegedly set by 
eco-terrorists, and from a weak Canadian dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Ski Championships brought worldwide publicity but the  
specter of a resort clogged with ski racers and their entourages 
may have dissuaded skiers and boarders from coming, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The late arrival of snow may have been the biggest turnoff.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think snow had a huge impact,'' Jensen said. ``If the snow  
returns to a more normal cycle ... I would expect an increase in 
skier visits on that basis alone.''

<HEADLINE> 53 Deaths in Heart Drug Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. said it no longer plans to  
pursue a version of its hypertension drug to treat congestive heart 
failure after a study earlier this year yielded poor results. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, there were nearly twice as many deaths among  
patients taking the drug as there were among those given a dummy 
medicine, the pharmaceutical company said. The study was halted 
after 53 patients on the medication died in the first six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly spokesman Ed West said it is unclear whether the drug  
hastened the patients' deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	A different formulation of the Lilly drug is sold under the name  
Cynt and used in Europe and Asia to treat high blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Indianapolis-based Lilly was studying the drug, a form of  
moxonidine, with Solvay SA, a Belgian company. 
</P>
<P>
	The clinical trial, in which the drug was to be tested on at  
least 4,000 congestive heart failure patients, began in August 1998 
and was supposed to last two years. The trial tested a 
sustained-release formulation of the drug, meaning it was designed 
to be absorbed into the body slowly. 
</P>
<P>
	But the trial was halted in February after 82 deaths -- 53 people  
on the drug and 29 on a placebo -- occurred among the first 2,000 
patients enrolled. The study was being conducted at medical 
facilities around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Lilly had said last March that the study was being halted but  
did not provide details at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	West said the deaths were unfortunate but not unusual  
considering the severity of the patients' illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is no longer studying the drug for congestive heart  
failure. 
</P>
<P>
	West said Lilly has not sought to get U.S. approval for Cynt  
because it does not have any advantages over existing high blood 
pressure pills on the market.

<HEADLINE> How Argentina Jet Survivors Fared </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Carlos Bariboto's last-minute  
decision to ignore his seat assignment in the front of a Boeing 737 
and sit in the rear with his 7-year-old son saved both their lives 
when their flight ended in a fiery crash that killed 70 people. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always thought sitting in the back of the plane might save  
my life one day,'' said Bariboto, who escaped Tuesday's crash of 
Flight 3142 with only minor injuries. He was released from a 
hospital Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 64 of the 100 people on board the ill-fated flight  
operated by Buenos Aires-based LAPA airlines -- or Lineas Aereas 
Privadas Argentinas -- were killed, and there were also reportedly 
fatalities on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The city morgue confirmed it had received the bodies of 70  
victims, but it was not clear how many of them were killed on the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The jetliner burst through an airport fence, careered across a  
busy highway, dragging cars and heavy machinery, before exploding 
in flames alongside a golf course. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators raked through the twisted wreckage Wednesday,  
carrying away charred bodies in plastic bags. A crane hoisted 
sections of the crumpled fuselage, which came to rest just yards 
from two sand traps. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, technical experts arrived from the United States to  
assist the investigation. The team included specialists in aircraft 
systems on the Boeing 737, the world's most commonly used 
commercial airplane. 
</P>
<P>
	From the Vatican, Pope John Paul II sent a telegram offering  
condolences and prayers for the ``serenity'' of those who lost 
loved ones. President Carlos Menem and his cabinet attended a Mass 
for victims amid two days of official mourning. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors said at least 10 survivors had only minor injuries and  
were released from hospitals. Others were critically injured. 
Rescue workers said Wednesday the pilot and co-pilot were among the 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash near downtown Buenos Aires's Jorge Newberry airport  
was Argentina's worst aviation disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives of those unaccounted for crowded a downtown government  
office to press officials for any news of their loved ones. 
Exasperated, they complained of a lack of information and little 
cooperation from airline officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Roman Perez sobbed as he vented his frustrations about  
trying to determine the fate of his 24-year-old son, a university 
student who traveled to Buenos Aires to take a dental class. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard so many different things ... that he's injured,  
disappeared,'' he said. ``I'm tired of talking to the people at 
LAPA. All I want is an official list of passengers who got on the 
plane.'' Roman Perez said his only hope was that his son had gone 
to a friend's house after fleeing the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	LAPA President Andres Deutsch said in a television interview his  
company was doing all it could to account for the missing. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he didn't believe there was anything mechanically wrong  
with the 29-year-old aircraft. ``All of the motors and its 
components were working perfectly before take off,'' he told 
Cronica TV. 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested the crash may have been caused by birds sucked into  
the plane's engines during its attempted ascent. He also said one 
of the plane's two black boxes has been found. 
</P>
<P>
	For those who lived through the crash, survival was freakishly  
determined: whether by a last-minute decision to change seats, by a 
quick decision to flee the burning wreckage, or just by the luck of 
being in the right place on the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Amayo, a 47-year-old doctor, said he frantically yanked at  
his seat belt after the plane slowed to a halt and flames began 
rising outside his window, consuming the front end of the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was the only person seated in my row so I just rushed out  
the back door,'' he said. ``When I realized I was OK and in one 
piece, I turned around (towards the plane) and couldn't believe my 
eyes. I just stood there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also among the fortunate was 35-year-old Gabriel Vanegas, who  
said he felt he had been born again. He vowed to never forgot the 
day of the wreck. 
</P>
<P>
	``From here on out, I've got two birthdays a year,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Workers' Productivity Slows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Growth in the productivity of American workers  
slowed considerably in the spring, reflecting an easing in the 
overall pace of economic growth, even while the cost of their labor 
surged. 
</P>
<P>
	The potentially troublesome developments, detailed in Labor  
Department reports released Thursday, could cause new interest rate 
anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
	A third report, released by the Commerce Department, said orders  
to factories rose a strong 2.1 percent in July, the biggest 
increase this year, following a 0.8 percent gain in June. 
Economists lauded that as fresh evidence of a resurgent 
manufacturing sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets, already nervous about the August unemployment  
figures due out Friday, were rattled by the developments. A 
quarter-hour after the reports were issued the Dow Jones industrial 
average fell sharply. The Dow closed Thursday at 10,843.21, down 
94.67 points, amid continuing fears among investors that the 
Federal Reserve has not yet completed its efforts to ward off 
inflation by imposing higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported that productivity -- the amount of  
output for each hour of work -- increased at an annual rate of 0.6 
percent in the April-June quarter. That was the slowest quarterly 
increase since the second quarter of 1998, when productivity rose 
at a rate of 0.4 percent. The 0.6 percent rate also was far below 
the 3.6 percent rate in the first three months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised second-quarter figure showed that productivity  
growth was even slower than the 1.3 percent growth rate the 
government initially estimated one month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. manufacturers have been hard hit by a global financial  
crisis, which dampened overseas demand for U.S. goods and increased 
competition from a flood of cheaper imports. The recovery of the 
manufacturing sector will power economic growth in the months 
ahead, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the slowdown in productivity reflected the fact  
that the gross domestic product -- the total output of goods and 
services -- also slowed sharply to an annual rate of 1.8 percent in 
the second quarter of this year, compared to 4.3 percent in the 
first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, unit labor costs, considered a key measure of  
whether the rate of rising labor costs could ignite inflation down 
the road, sprinted ahead at an annual rate of 4.5 percent in the 
second quarter. That was the largest increase since the first 
quarter of 1994 when they also rose 4.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we saw in the second quarter was a clear warning sign  
that the tight labor markets are having an impact on labor costs 
and that adds to the belief that another hike in interest rates 
this year is a distinct possibility,'' said economist Joel Naroff 
of Naroff Economic Advisors. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tim O'Neill, chief economist for the Bank of Montreal and  
Harris Bank, said he expects a sharp increase in productivity 
growth for the current third quarter, coming from what he believes 
will be an increase in third-quarter GDP growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week the Federal Reserve bumped up interest rates but  
signaled that additional increases may not be needed unless the 
economy shows signs of overheating or if inflation flares. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Zandi, an economist with Regional Financial Associates,  
said the figures released Thursday ``would argue for more Fed 
tightening.'' But other economists said that additional economic 
data will offer a better barometer of whether the Fed raises rates 
again this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has warned that if productivity  
slows, wage pressures are likely to quickly surface, given that 
labor markets are at their tightest in nearly three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	In still another report, the Labor Department said the number of  
Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits last week 
rose by 4,000 to 289,000. Economists consider jobless claims level 
below 300,000 an indication of an extremely tight labor market. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the government will release its August unemployment  
report and many economists expect the rate -- now at 4.3 percent -- 
will return to a 29-year low of 4.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Minn. Doctor Admits Ramp Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	APPLE VALLEY, Minn. (AP) -- A doctor pleaded guilty Thursday to  
assault charges for running a 69-year-old woman off the road, then 
hitting her, because she cut him off on a highway. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for Thomas J. Valente entered the guilty plea for his  
client. Sentencing was set for next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I confronted and struck an elderly woman, which was an  
unthinkable act,'' Valente, 41, said in a statement entered into 
the court record. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he is getting counseling for ``an acute anger management  
problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia Hendrickson said Valente used his BMW to force her off

<HEADLINE> 2nd Suspect Tried in Immigrant Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Prosecutors may not be able to use their star  
witness in the case against a self-proclaimed white supremacist who 
admitted that he killed a West African immigrant at a bus stop 
because he was black. 
</P>
<P>
	Nathan Thill, 21, is accused of shooting Oumar Dia to death and  
paralyzing Jeannie VanVelkinburgh as she came to Dia's aid. 
</P>
<P>
	The first trial in the case ended with the murder conviction of  
Thill's companion, Jeremiah Barnum. Ms. VanVelkinburgh's testimony 
helped convict him, even though she cried from her wheelchair, 
screamed at Barnum, belched loudly and sometimes refused to answer 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	But in July, a judge overturned the verdict, ruling that the  
trial judge failed to control Ms. Van Velkinburgh on the stand and 
jeopardized Barnum's right to a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors are appealing the decision, but with jury selection  
for Thill's trial scheduled to begin Friday, they would not comment 
on whether they plan to call Ms. VanVelkinburgh again. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just trying to prosecute the case fairly,'' prosecutor  
Chuck Lepley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys did not return a telephone call seeking  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal analyst Andrew Cohen, a Denver attorney, noted prosecutors  
must decide whether Ms. VanVelkinburgh's testimony is crucial to 
their case. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is a witness who brings a lot to the prosecution ... but  
her credibility is in doubt and she might bring in a big risk,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thill could get the death penalty if convicted of ethnic  
intimidation, murder and attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Senegal, the slightly statured Dia was a hotel  
bellhop who sent his earnings home to support his family and fellow 
villagers. 
</P>
<P>
	After leaving work on Nov. 19, 1997, Dia, was waiting at a  
downtown bus stop along with Ms. VanVelkinburgh when Thill and 
Barnum approached. 
</P>
<P>
	Thill knocked a baseball cap from Dia's head, called him a  
racial epithet and asked him whether he was prepared to die, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. VanVelkinburgh has testified that Barnum put Dia in a  
headlock and told him he did not belong in downtown's ``white 
territory.'' She said Thill pulled out a gun and shot Dia several 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	When she tried to intervene, Ms. VanVelkinburgh said Thill shot  
her in the spine, pointed the gun at her head and pulled the 
trigger twice. 
</P>
<P>
	The weapon was empty.  
</P>
<P>
	After his arrest, Thill told reporters, police and prosecutors  
that he shot Dia because he was black. Thill acknowledged in news 
interviews that he was a white supremacist and Dia, in his 
bellhop's apparel, was ``in the enemy's uniform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver District Judge Federico Alvarez has said Thill's  
statements to police can't be used during the trial because he was 
not properly advised of his constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he said Thill's statements to the media may be used  
because Thill sought out reporters voluntarily.

<HEADLINE> Trinidad Sees De La Hoya Knockout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAJARDO, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Felix Trinidad made a final promise  
to his countrymen before leaving Puerto Rico for the biggest fight 
of his career: An early knockout of Oscar De La Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in the best physical condition of my life, and I can't see  
how De La Hoya could end the fight on his feet,'' Trinidad said 
Thursday. ``I'm going to knock him out after the sixth round.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad made the comments at a news conference at the El  
Conquistador Resort, his last appearance on the island before 
leaving Saturday to finish training in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	The two undefeated champions will fight Sept. 18 in a  
welterweight unification bout at the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad, the IBF champion, is 35-0 with 30 knockouts. De La  
Hoya holds the WBC title and is 31-0 with 25 knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I put my hands on a boxer he falls, and De La Hoya will  
be no exception,'' Trinidad said. ``He won't be able to take the 
punishment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Promoter Don King was in Puerto Rico to support Trinidad.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see anyone who could beat Tito (Trinidad). He's going  
to knock out De La Hoya in six rounds,'' King said. ``What I'm most 
interested in is that De La Hoya gets into the ring, doesn't get 
sick, or even a bruise, before the fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad is guaranteed $8.5 million for the fight, while De La  
Hoya will earn $15 million.

<HEADLINE>  Darryl Hitless in First Game Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There were no majestic home runs from Darryl  
Strawberry in his comeback. Not even a base hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a couple of strikeouts and a walk for the New York Yankees  
slugger in his first game back from colon cancer and a drug 
suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	``You always look for the situation to do something dramatic,''  
Strawberry said Thursday after the Yankees beat the Oakland 
Athletics 9-3. ``It just wasn't one of those days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry's fourth comeback in five years with the Yankees  
began with warm applause from the 33,147 fans, who remember the 
dramatic homers and the role Strawberry played on two World Series 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry's first major league at-bat since last Sept. 27, came  
leading off the second inning against Gil Heredia and offered no 
new memories. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry took a big cut at the first pitch, fouling it back  
onto the screen. After taking a called second strike and then a 
ball, Strawberry checked his swing on a fastball that nipped the 
outside corner. 
</P>
<P>
	John Shulock called him out and Strawberry walked back to the  
dugout after a brief discussion of the call. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to take some at-bats for me to make the  
adjustments,'' Strawberry said. ``When you haven't played at this 
level for this long, it takes more than one day to get back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry walked on five pitches in the third inning and was  
erased on a double-play grounder by Jorge Posada. 
</P>
<P>
	With a man on second and one out in the fifth, Oakland manager  
brought in left-hander Ron Mahay. Strawberry looked overmatched 
this time, again striking out on four pitches. He waved at strike 
three. 
</P>
<P>
	Chili Davis pinch-hit for Strawberry in the sixth.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was really good to be back, with all the guys pulling for  
me,'' Strawberry said. ``It was a good day overall for the club. We 
won the game. That's the most important thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The next month will be a test for Strawberry, as manager Joe  
Torre determines whether Strawberry can contribute in the 
postseason. He will get at-bats as a pinch-hitter and a few chances 
to start at DH or in left field as Torre rests his regulars down 
the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``He feels comfortable and it's just a matter of getting him  
at-bats,'' Torre said.

<HEADLINE> Computers Improve Weather Forecasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists have found a way to get weather  
forecasting computers to work together like a team, with each 
contributing by concentrating on its strength. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida State University researchers combined forecasts  
produced by computers around the world into what they call a 
``superensemble'' that produces results that are better than the 
sum of its parts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are seeking to demonstrate to the weather community that it  
can do so well it can become a useful product in the future,'' said 
T. N. Krishnamurti, leader of the project reported in Friday's 
edition of the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, in a forecast of windspeed over the United States  
three days in advance, errors in the various models ranged from 5.8 
mph to 10.1 mph with an average of 6.5 mph. The superensemble 
reduced the error to 5.6 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	In a forecast of hurricane winds three days into the future,  
computer errors ranged from 31.3 mph to 32.4 mph. It fell to 21.5 
mph with the superensemble. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't mean the superensemble can replace the other  
computers, though, Krishnamurti stressed: ``It cooperates with the 
others. It doesn't exist if they don't exist, if they improve it 
improves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Computer models are massively complex programs that use  
mathematical formulas to describe how the atmosphere works. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of readings of wind direction and speed, temperature,  
pressure, humidity, light, cloud cover and other variables at 
different altitudes are collected around the world and continually 
fed into the computers. With a series of such reports, the formulas 
can then calculate what the weather is doing at a particular 
moment, assess how it is changing and forecast that change into the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	Several important models are used in different countries, and  
the team studied their past successes and failures, calculating any 
biases. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, one model might consistently forecast too much or  
too little rain in an area while another might have trouble 
predicting the strength of the North wind. 
</P>
<P>
	When they find problem areas they give less weight to that  
portion of the forecast from that particular computer, and if 
another is better on a particular area it gets more weight. 
</P>
<P>
	Combining the forecasts, allowing for the strengths and  
weaknesses of each, allows them to produce a single new forecast 
they call the ``collective superensemble'' that is better than the 
average of those involved, Krishnamurti explained. 
</P>
<P>
	``So it's not just one model that it represents, it represents  
the best'' of all of them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zoltan Toth, who works on ensemble forecasting at the National  
Center for Environmental Prediction near Washington, said the 
report was very interesting. 
</P>
<P>
	``They look at all variables at all levels. I don't think anyone  
has attempted to do this,'' Toth said. ``It's primarily a bias 
remover,'' he said, confirming that removing biases can reduce the 
error in the forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	In his work on ensembles, Toth said, researchers use several  
computer models to produce a range of forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the computer forecast models being used in the Florida  
project are those from the Bureau of Meteorology Research Center 
and the Council of Industrial and Research Organizations, both in 
Melbourne, Australia; European Center for Medium Range Weather 
Forecasts, London; Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, 
Princeton, N.J.; Japan Meteorological Agency, Tokyo; Laboratory 
Meteorologic Dynamique, Paris; Max Planck Institute, Hamburg, 
Germany; National Center for Environmental Prediction, Washington; 
Research Provision Numerique, Montreal and United Kingdom 
Meteorological Office, London.

<HEADLINE> Cops Accuse Romanowski in Drug Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CASTLE ROCK, Colo. (AP) -- Douglas County authorities are  
recommending that felony criminal charges be filed against Denver 
Broncos linebacker Bill Romanowski, claiming he used fraud to get 
access to a controlled drug, Douglas County authorities said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for Romanowski denied the charges, and said Romanowski  
would fight the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The Douglas County sheriff's office said it is recommending that  
felony criminal charges be filed against Romanowski; with his wife, 
Julie; another woman; and Dr. Randall L. Snook of Littleton, Colo., 
over alleged misuse of the drug Phentermine. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug is usually prescribed to help severely obese people  
lose weight, but also acts as a stimulant to the central nervous 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	Sgt. Attila Denes, a sheriff's spokesman, said Julie Romanowski  
and the other woman obtained prescriptions from the doctor and then 
gave the Phentermine to Bill Romanowski for his personal use. 
</P>
<P>
	The Romanowskis, who live in Douglas County, couldn't be  
reached. A spokesman for the Denver Broncos declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The sheriff's office conducted the investigation along with the  
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Romanowski faces felony charges of fraud and deceit,  
conspiracy, and a misdemeanor charge of unlawful use of a 
controlled substance. 
</P>
<P>
	Julie Romanowski and Johnson face felony charges of fraud and  
deceit, as well as conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Snook faces the same charges along with a felony charge of  
unlawful acts and a charge of unlawful dispensing of a controlled 
substance.

<HEADLINE> Stargell Hopes for Hospital Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Hall of Famer Willie Stargell said Thursday he  
hopes to be released from a three-week hospital stay by Labor Day 
but declined to comment specifically about his health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Stargell, the Pittsburgh Pirates' career leader in home runs and  
RBIs, has been hospitalized in Pittsburgh since early August, 
undergoing blood tests and kidney dialysis, according to several 
Pirates sources. 
</P>
<P>
	A former Pirates teammate, who spoke on condition of anonymity,  
said Stargell has undergone dialysis for several years. Dialysis is 
used to eliminate impurities from the blood during kidney failure. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates declined again to comment specifically about  
Stargell's illness, but issued a statement he gave to a team 
official. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me begin by thanking my well-wishing fans for their  
concern after hearing of my hospitalization,'' Stargell said. ``I 
have, in fact, been in the hospital for three weeks for management 
of a recent illness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stargell denied an ESPN report that he will require  
hospitalization for another three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Recent reports speculate that I am to be hospitalized for at  
least three more weeks,'' he said. ``To the contrary, it is 
anticipated that I will be discharged to enjoy the upcoming holiday 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Again, thank you for your concern and trust that I am doing  
well,'' Stargell said. ``I look forward to resuming my position 
soon for the playoffs and the World Series as a special assistant 
to the general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	News of Stargell's illness caused phones to ring continuously at  
the Pirates' offices as concerned fans sought more information 
about his condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The 58-year-old Stargell spent at least several weeks in a  
Pittsburgh hospital, checking in under an assumed name, before 
being moved to another hospital, the sources said. He hopes to be 
discharged by this weekend, but did not say if he would be 
readmitted soon for further tests or treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1979 National League co-MVP has had recurring health  
problems for about 10 years, including heart trouble while he was 
an Atlanta Braves coach in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates front-office staff member who spoke to Stargell  
expected to talk to the Hall of Famer's wife, Margaret, but 
Stargell himself fielded the call from his hospital bed in 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates' official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,  
described Stargell as ``upbeat and positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pirates managing general partner Kevin McClatchy, who has  
cautioned team employees against commenting about Stargell's 
health, also issued a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We in the Pirates' family have always been respectful of  
Willie's personal request for privacy regarding his health,'' 
McClatchy said. ``The club has been aware of his health problems 
since he returned to the Pirates in 1997 and we have been 
sympathetic to his needs and wishes. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no greater icon for Pirates baseball and  
professionalism than Willie Stargell, and we hope that the media 
shows him the amount of respect that he deserves in this matter,'' 
McClatchy said. ``The entire Pirate ``Fam-A-Lee'' wishes him well 
in his recovery and we hope to see `Pops' back at the stadium very 
soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stargell, then a 38-year-old first baseman seen as several years  
past his prime, led the 1979 Pirates, nicknamed the ``Fam-A-Lee,'' 
to the franchise's last pennant and World Series title. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite aching knees that limited his mobility and playing time,  
Stargell hit 32 homers to share the NL MVP award with Keith 
Hernandez of St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	He also won the MVP awards in the NL playoffs and World Series,  
hitting the go-ahead homer in the Pirates' World Series Game 7 
victory in Baltimore. He hit a career-high 48 homers -- the most by 
any Pirates player in the last 49 years -- during the 1971 World 
Series title season. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Pirates' 1979 World Series championship trophy  
apparently was stolen from the Allegheny Club, a private restaurant 
located in Three Rivers Stadium, sometime late Wednesday or early 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The trophy originally belonged to the John W. Galbreath family,  
who owned the team in 1979. Following the deaths of Galbreath and 
his son, Dan, the former Pirates president, the trophy was sold to 
the Allegheny Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were investigating.

<HEADLINE> Police: Jim Brown's Wife Abused </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The wife of former pro football star Jim  
Brown pleaded with officers not to arrest him after she came to a 
police station and tearfully told them of a history of abuse in 
their two-year marriage, detectives testified Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Monique Brown was tearful, trembling but open in discussing what  
she described as incidents of abuse, some of which involved threats 
on her life, said Detective Brian Gasparian, the first detective to 
interview her after she called 911 in June. 
</P>
<P>
	But, Gasparian said, Monique Brown was concerned from the  
beginning about what would happen to her husband, who is on trial 
on misdemeanor charges of making a terrorist threat and vandalism 
for bashing her car with a shovel. 
</P>
<P>
	``She seemed upset. She was crying,'' Gasparian said. ``She  
asked me what was going to happen, if her husband was going to be 
arrested. I said I didn't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After further discussion, he said, ``She advised me that she  
didn't want him arrested. ... She said she wanted me to just take a 
report in case something were to happen in the future. Her eyes 
were red. She was kind of shaky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gasparian said Monique Brown, 25, related a long list of  
incidents in which Brown, 63, had given her a black eye, choked 
her, threatened her with a metal spear and, on the night of June 
15, bashed the windows out of her car. 
</P>
<P>
	The detective said she told him that two days before the  
incident she found her husband inebriated at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told her he had to drink to pass out to avoid killing the  
victim and her friend,'' Gasparian said, referring to a college pal 
of Monique Brown who was visiting the Brown home. ``(He said) he 
had to pray to God for strength not to kill the two of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to Monique Brown's account, Gasparian said, she stayed  
at a hotel that night and believed her marriage was over. But, the 
detective testified, she said she returned home the next day and 
quoted Brown as saying, ``Oh, you don't have to leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gasparian told the jury about Monique Brown's account of the  
June 15 argument in which she quoted Brown as saying that ``if he 
had not made a promise to her about not being physically abusive he 
would have broken her neck,'' then got a shovel and began hitting 
her car. Monique Brown then ran to a neighbor's house and dialed 
911. 
</P>
<P>
	During the interview, Gasparian said, she said Brown threatened  
her, saying, ``If she ever took him to court, he would kill her or 
have her killed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gasparian said that during the 45 minutes they talked Monique  
Brown seemed ``very nice'' and explained that ``she worked hard at 
the marriage, that she tries to make it work and be a good wife. 
She seemed to love her husband.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to make him happy, he said, she told him ``on  
occasion she had brought home another woman to have a relationship 
-- three people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The detective appeared embarrassed at talking about the  
situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Grace Kim Lee prodded him with questions, asking if  
Monique Brown said that her husband also brought women home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes,'' the detective said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Was she talking about sexual activities?'' Lee asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``Yes,'' the detective said.  
</P>
<P>
	``And in what context?'' Lee asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``In how she tried to make the marriage work and make it a happy  
marriage,'' Gasparian said. 
</P>
<P>
	On cross-examination, lawyer William Graysen asked if there were  
any other witnesses to corroborate Monique Brown's accounts of 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	The detective said there weren't.  
</P>
<P>
	``So all you know is what Mrs. Brown told you?'' the lawyer  
asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes,'' said Gasparian, who added under Lee's questioning, ``I  
believed her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Dennis McNeal said that the morning after Gasparian  
interviewed Monique Brown, she showed up at the station at 7 a.m. 
looking as if she hadn't slept all night. 
</P>
<P>
	``She told me she wanted to throw out the charges against Mr.  
Brown. She said she was back with him,'' McNeal said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What did she want to get across to you?'' Lee said.  
</P>
<P>
	``That she didn't want Mr. Brown to go to jail,'' McNeal said.  
</P>
<P>
	McNeal said she never denied any of the claims of abuse, nor did  
she say that her 911 call was false. 
</P>
<P>
	``She continually told me she wanted to drop the charges,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also said: ``She told me she was in an argument with Mr.  
Brown and he told her if he wasn't in a proper frame of mind he 
would snap her neck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside court, Monique Brown, who was excluded from court during  
the testimony, met her husband and they held hands for cameras as 
he complained about current domestic violence laws which he said 
require no proof when someone claims a terrorist threat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Under these laws she is now the boss of my life forever,''  
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She can pick up a phone and call the police and that's it. ...  
This law forever makes us totally unimportant in our home,'' he 
said, referring to men. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown's defense case opened with his 17-year-old daughter,  
Kimberly, testifying she never saw him commit any acts of violence 
against Monique Brown. She also insisted that any arguments between 
the two were started by her stepmother and portrayed her father as 
the peacemaker of the two. 
</P>
<P>
	On the night of the alleged abuse, she said she was  
eavesdropping on an argument between the couple and could hear 
Monique Brown's voice because it was raised. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was acting enraged, like going kind of crazy, yelling,  
cursing, accusing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, she said she heard glass breaking as the car windows were  
being smashed. 
</P>
<P>
	Kimberly was followed to the witness stand by Rudolph Johnson,  
who said he is chief of staff in one of Brown's businesses. Johnson 
said he spent every day at the Brown home and never saw Monique 
Brown with a black eye, choke marks or any other signs of physical 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	He also offered a ringing endorsement of Brown's character,  
saying, ``He's my surrogate father, my friend, my mentor. He helped 
me change my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In spite of that, he said he would never lie for Brown because,  
``he wouldn't want me to lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defense was to wrap up its case Friday.

<HEADLINE> Human Smuggling Can Be Dangerous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEMBROKE PINES, Fla. (AP) -- Death is the ultimate price refugees  
pay when they entrust their lives to smugglers, say new public 
service announcements to be broadcast throughout southern Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Border Patrol agents on Wednesday announced the campaign, which  
is aimed at reducing the number of Cubans, Haitians and other 
refugees who risk their lives by paying smugglers to bring them to 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since 1993, there have been more than 140 confirmed deaths of  
Cuban and Haitian migrants during attempted ocean crossings'' said 
Michael Sheehy of the Border Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents hope the U.S.-based relatives of migrants will take heed  
when they see the ominous scenes of people struggling in rough surf 
or listen to a somber radio spot detailing the dangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Gov. Frank Brogan characterized the smugglers as criminals  
who care only about making money. 
</P>
<P>
	``They treat people as nothing more than human cargo,'' he said.  
``They do not care at all about the lives of the desperate people 
they put on rafts and into small boats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The spots in English, Spanish and Creole were sent to 55  
television stations and 100 radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, the Immigration and Naturalization Service formed an  
anti-smuggling task force to focus on the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard has added two additional cutters to patrol the  
waters off the Florida Keys. The agency has stopped 1,181 migrants 
at sea this year, compared with 1,047 all of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Border Patrol has apprehended about 2,628 people since its  
fiscal year began last Oct. 1, compared with 1,041 refugees 
apprehended during the first 11 months of the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight people were convicted of alien smuggling last year  
compared with 43 since Oct. 1, agents said.

<HEADLINE> FCC Urges Low-Power FM Stations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A proposal to create thousands of new  
low-power FM radio stations nationwide would give voice to a 
greater diversity of views and need not compromise the quality of 
existing stations, the nation's top airwaves regulator said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission has proposed allowing  
low-power, low-cost radio stations, and its chairman, Bill Kennard, 
defended the idea before one of its most vocal opponents -- the 
National Association of Broadcasters -- at the group's meeting in 
Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC plan is meant to help churches, schools, city  
governments and community groups get on the air by licensing them 
to operate radio stations with low power levels from 1 watt to 
1,000 watts. 
</P>
<P>
	Commercial broadcasters argue that adding new low-power stations  
would cause significant interference with existing stations and 
degrade service to listeners. The NAB has commissioned studies that 
support this assertion. Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., chairman of the 
House Commerce telecommunications subcommittee, also has urged the 
FCC to halt efforts for low-power stations. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kennard said studies by FCC engineers using a wide range of  
inexpensive radios hold promise. They indicate that current 
interference standards can be used to develop an engineering 
solution for low-power radio, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't need to create a whole new set of interference  
standards, especially not just for the purpose of thwarting 
low-power radio,'' Kennard said in prepared remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC stopped licensing low-powered FM radio stations around  
1978 to help solidify regular FM stations. But the proposal offered 
earlier this year has sparked interest among hundreds of 
individuals and grass-roots groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard urged broadcasters to work with the agency on the  
technical components of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need cooperation, not confrontation,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Commercial broadcasters also say regulators are getting ahead of  
themselves by trying to introduce low-power stations without 
knowing how they will affect digital radio when that service is 
introduced. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kennard insisted that the FCC is committed to making digital  
radio a reality and that both objectives can be achieved. The 
commission plans to launch a formal proceeding into digital radio 
this fall, he said.

<HEADLINE> New Drug May Treat Malaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists have discovered a possible new drug  
for malaria, an antibiotic that seemed to cure mice by attacking 
the disease in a different manner than today's treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no way to know yet if the antibiotic, fosmidomycin, will  
help people with malaria. 
</P>
<P>
	But new treatments are urgently needed. Malaria kills up to 3  
million people a year and sickens another 300 million. A parasite 
spread by mosquitos, it is evolving to resist current medications. 
</P>
<P>
	German scientists discovered an enzyme present in malaria that  
appears crucial to how the parasite synthesizes hormones and other 
substances. 
</P>
<P>
	The antibiotic fosmidomycin happens to shut down the enzyme,  
called ``DOXP reductoisomerase,'' in bacteria. So lead researcher 
Hassan Jomaa of Justus-Liebig University and colleagues tested 
whether it also would target the enzyme in the malaria parasite. 
</P>
<P>
	They fed fosmidomycin to mice with malaria, and cured the  
rodents. 
</P>
<P>
	Fosmidomycin was developed by a Japanese company in the late  
1970s and testing showed it was safe for people, Jomaa said. But it 
has never been sold because it never before seemed to offer a 
benefit over other antibiotics, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to test fosmidomycin (against malaria) in humans as  
soon as possible,'' he said in an e-mail interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The downside: Fosmidomycin dissipates in the body very quickly  
so, if it does prove useful to people, repeated doses throughout 
the day would be needed.

<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKLIN, Tenn. (AP) -- Country singer George Jones returned to  
the scene of his near-fatal accident to film a music video. 
</P>
<P>
	The bridge on Highway 96 south of Nashville was used as the  
setting for the video to promote ``Band Of Angels,'' a duet with 
gospel music singer Vestal Goodman. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last time I was here at this bridge, when I hit it and had

Jones said Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Penguins Sign Wing Tom Chorske </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Tom Chorske, who played 26 games for three NHL  
teams last season, was one of three forwards signed Thursday by the 
Pittsburgh Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins open training camp Saturday, a day after new owner  
Mario Lemieux's takeover of the team is expected to be approved in 
U.S. Bankruptcy Court. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz has set a 9 a.m. hearing  
Friday to finalize the paperwork of a transaction that took nearly 
10 months to complete. Lemieux's purchase was approved Wednesday by 
the NHL Board of Governors. 
</P>
<P>
	Chorske, 32, was an unrestricted free agent who had three  
assists last season while playing for the New York Islanders, 
Washington Capitals and Vancouver Canucks. He has 114 goals and 117 
assists in 563 career NHL games. 
</P>
<P>
	Also signed were Greg Crozier, 23, who played with Michigan of  
the Central Collegiate Hockey Association last season, and Dylan 
Gyori, 20, a forward with Tri-City of the Western Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
	Crozier was the Penguins' third-round pick in the 1994 entry  
draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins have invited 63 players to camp.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Near End of Their Vacation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- A summer vacation that put President  
Clinton's lame-duck status on uncomfortable display neared a close 
Thursday with a pair of fund-raisers for the family's newly minted 
politician -- the president's wife. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons also waited to find out whether their offer to  
purchase a home in a New York City suburb was accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	While Clinton golfed, lounged and gave a handful of political  
speeches, much of the 16-day trip to Massachusetts and New York 
focused on Hillary Rodham Clinton and her presumed run for the 
Senate next year. Over the course of the trip, Mrs. Clinton 
expected to raise about $800,000 for her exploratory campaign 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	If she runs, Mrs. Clinton must live in New York by Election Day.  
If the Clintons have their way, home will be a Georgian colonial 
they toured last weekend in Westchester County. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources familiar with the Clintons' housing search said they  
made a bid on the house and were waiting to see if it is accepted. 
The Clintons offered less than the asking price of nearly $1.7 
million, but the sources would not detail the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	The 110-year-old house sits on a little more than an acre of  
parklike grounds, is located near a golf course and boasts a 
swimming pool, lush landscaping and an exercise room on the top 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The house apparently passed security muster this week. The  
Secret Service checked out the house with an eye to protecting 
Clinton when he is a private citizen. Former presidents have a 
small security detail. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has 17 months left in his second term, and is thinking  
about his future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can work for cheap,'' he told a New Yorker this week. ``I've  
got a good pension.'' At another point he noted, ``I'm looking for 
a new role.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons spent more than half of the vacation in New York,  
forsaking a second week on the Massachusetts resort island of 
Martha's Vineyard where they have been summer regulars during 
Clinton's more than six years in office. They are to head to Camp 
David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton seemed both delighted and unsettled by the enthusiastic  
reception Mrs. Clinton drew during their first joint trip to New 
York state since she formed the exploratory committee. It marked 
the first time that Clinton campaigned on her behalf and helped 
raise money for the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	But he plainly laments that his own time is waning and that he  
cannot run for president again. ``I hate it, actually,'' he told 
supporters last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	In upstate New York this week, the president watched as crowds  
chanted and cheered for Mrs. Clinton, and the route of his 
motorcade near the Syracuse-area golf course where he played 
Thursday was lined with signs that read: ``Go Hillary!'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the second time in a week, Clinton played the round with a  
group of eight instead of the traditional foursome. His party of 
upstate New York Democrats and business leaders included the 
majority leader of the New York Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton drove his own cart -- the only driving his cosseted life  
of limousines and helicopters allows him -- and went wide at the 
first turn off a paved cart path. 
</P>
<P>
	A gallery of club members at the Lafayette Golf and Country Club  
chuckled when Clinton headed the wrong way a few minutes later and 
had to pull a U-turn around a dead pine tree. Many of the carts in 
an unofficial motorcade behind him followed suit.

<HEADLINE> Johnson Will 'Let Loose' in 200M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Although Maurice Greene won the 200  
meters at the world championships, Michael Johnson is intent on 
proving he is still the fastest at that distance. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, the 400-meter world record finally his, promised  
Thursday to ``let loose'' in the 200 at tonight's Van Damme meet 
and establish himself again as the favorite to retain his Olympic 
title in Sydney next year. 
</P>
<P>
	After years of chasing the 400 world record, he finally  
succeeded in Seville, Spain, defending his world championship title 
and setting a world mark of 43.18 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	He planned to run his first post-Seville race in the 200 at the  
Van Damme. 
</P>
<P>
	``Usually when I run a good 400, a good 200 will follow,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not predict, however, that he would challenge his world  
record of 19.32 seconds in the 200. Surpassing the season's best of 
19.84 by Nigerian Francis Obikwelu would suit him just fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``My coach and I decided we are not going to think about any  
particular time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene won the Seville 200 title in 19.90, only the fifth-best  
time of the year. With a personal best of 19.86, there are 10 
runners ahead of him on the all-time list. Johnson has five times 
among the top dozen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would bet on me,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Certainly, everyone is expecting Johnson to win at the Van  
Damme, the sixth of seven Golden League meets. Greene decided to 
sidestep the event in the King Baudouin stadium, known for its fast 
curves, and race in Britain instead. 
</P>
<P>
	The absence of Greene put some of the focus on the men's 800 and  
women's 3,000, where Dane Wilson Kipketer and Romania's Gabriela 
Szabo have their eyes on a $1 million Golden League bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	The two champions have won all five Golden League meets so far,  
and if they continue their streak through the Van Damme and 
Tuesday's ISTAF Berlin meet, they will end up with $500,000 each as 
the overall jackpot would be sliced in half. 
</P>
<P>
	Steeplechase world record holder Bernard Barmasai also won his  
five races so far, but the IAAF kicked him out of the jackpot 
competition. He planned to run tonight, bent on winning his two 
remaining races to prove a point. Afterwards, he said he might sue 
the IAAF if the share of the jackpot is denied him. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAAF punished Barmasai for saying he colluded with a rival  
to determine the outcome of the Golden League race in Zurich. 
Barmasai denied he tried to fix the race. 
</P>
<P>
	American 100-meter world champion Marion Jones was the only  
other athlete with a perfect 5-for-5 performance, but the sprinter 
has not recovered from the back injury suffered during the 
semifinals of the women's 200 in Seville last week.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Fund-Raiser Backs House Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Golf buddy and political financier Terry  
McAuliffe has raised money for Bill Clinton's White House campaigns 
and presidential library, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's 
Senate bid and the couple's legal defense fund. 
</P>
<P>
	And now he's helping them share once again in the great American  
dream -- owning their own home. 
</P>
<P>
	McAuliffe is putting up $1.35 million as collateral to guarantee  
the money the Clintons are borrowing to buy their first home of 
their own since at least the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The president and Mrs. Clinton signed a contract Thursday to buy  
a $1.7 million house in Westchester County, about an hour north of 
New York City, and will put up the $350,000 down payment out of 
their own money. 
</P>
<P>
	McAuliffe -- a former investment banker who made a fortune in  
home building, telecommunications and title insurance -- is an 
important member of Clinton's inner circle, politically and 
personally. 
</P>
<P>
	He was national finance chairman of the Clinton-Gore campaign in  
1996 and co-chaired Clinton's inauguration the next year. He heads 
the effort to raise $125 million for the Clinton presidential 
library to be built in Arkansas and advised Mrs. Clinton when she 
was first considering a run for the Senate from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	After the 1996 election, Clinton asked McAuliffe to chair the  
Democratic National Committee. McAuliffe turned him down, in part, 
it was said, because of the controversy over fund raising and the 
record amounts collected by, among others, McAuliffe. A 
well-publicized McAuliffe memo was blamed by many for the access 
that later-embarrassing political donors had to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	But he remained a close personal friend of Clinton and his wife  
and was often a member of the president's weekend golf foursomes. A 
native of Syracuse, the has been with the Clintons nearly all this 
week during their vacation in upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you this -- I have no closer friends than the  
president and first lady,'' McAuliffe said Thursday night at a 
fund-raiser one of his friends from kindergarten was hosting for 
Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	McAuliffe also has helped Vice President Al Gore raise money,  
and was the chief fund-raiser for House Minority Leader Dick 
Gephardt in his 1988 bid for the White House.

<HEADLINE> Boivin Named Canadiens President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Businessman Pierre Boivin was named Thursday as  
the new president of the Montreal Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
	Boivin, whose appointment was made public at a news conference  
given by club owner Molson Inc., replaces Ronald Corey. Corey 
resigned in May after 17 years as president of hockey's most 
celebrated team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadiens are hoping Boivin can turn the Canadiens around  
financially. 
</P>
<P>
	Like other NHL clubs in Canada, the Canadiens have fallen on  
hard times, and owner Molson Inc. is under pressure from 
shareholders to have the hockey and entertainment division thrive 
as well as its beer business. 
</P>
<P>
	``He possesses valuable knowledge of the NHL and has first-hand  
experience with many of the issues that affect the NHL today,'' 
Molson chief executive James Arnett said of Boivin. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Pierre Boivin, we have a president who can deal effectively  
with the wide range of issues facing Molson and the Canadiens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boivin left his post as president of Canstar Sports this summer.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm definitely confident that with the current coaching staff  
and the current potential roster coming out of this year's training 
camp, that we will have an exciting and intense team on the ice,'' 
Boivin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I'm definitely confident that with Molson's commitment,  
and with everyone in the organization, we can once again win a 
Stanley Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canstar Sports, a Montreal-based company bought by  
sporting-goods giant Nike in 1994, is best known for its Bauer 
skates. 
</P>
<P>
	Boivin is known as a hockey fan as well as a hard-nosed  
businessman. 
</P>
<P>
	He was one of the principal negotiators when Nike purchased  
Canstar. He later presided over the closing of a skate plant in 
Cambridge, Ontario, and large layoffs at the company's main plant 
in Saint-Jerome, Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
	Boivin is also a former president of Norvinca, a Montreal  
company that distributed Nordica ski boots, high-end Look bicycles, 
Dynastar skis and Prince tennis equipment.

<HEADLINE> Aki Berg Returning to Kings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Restricted free-agent defenseman Aki  
Berg is returning to the Los Angeles Kings, having agreed to terms 
of a one-year contract with the NHL team. 
</P>
<P>
	Berg will earn $762,500 plus bonuses based on performance.  
</P>
<P>
	``Aki belongs in the National Hockey League and, more  
importantly, in Los Angeles,'' Kings general manager Dave Taylor 
said Thursday. ``We are very pleased to have him back. He's a big, 
young, mobile defender, and we're excited to add him to our 
defensive corps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berg played in his native Finland last year after failing to  
reach an agreement with the Kings. In 48 games with TPS Turku, the 
6-foot-3, 215-pounder had eight goals and seven assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Berg had two goals and 21 assists in 164 games over three  
seasons with the Kings. He became the youngest player in team 
history when he made his NHL debut on Oct. 7, 1995 at 18 years, two 
months and nine days. 
</P>
<P>
	Berg, the third overall selection in the 1995 NHL draft, is  
expected to be on hand for the start of training camp Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Cans of Party Spray String Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three California companies are recalling more  
than 900,000 cans of extremely flammable party spray string after 
one child was seriously burned. 
</P>
<P>
	When sprayed near an open flame the string catches fire, the  
Consumer Product Safety Commission said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	An 11-year-old boy suffered serious burns from flaming spray at  
his birthday party, causing permanent scars, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sprays, ``Crazy Ribbon'' and ``Crazy String,'' and are  
manufactured by Stelex Enterprises Inc., Major Import and LeSa Yang 
Family Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	They come in silver-colored cans, about 6.5 inches high, with a  
plastic tap matching the color of the spray. 
</P>
<P>
	Party and hobby stores sold the sprays nationwide for between $2  
and $4 from October 1996 through July 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission said customers should take the sprays away from  
children, stop using them immediately and return them to the store 
where they were purchased for a refund.

<HEADLINE> Former Colts QB Faces New Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Former Indianapolis Colts quarterback Art  
Schlichter, sentenced to serve at least four years in an Indiana 
prison for gambling convictions, will be released from prison 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Schlichter, who won early release by earning two college  
degrees behind bars, won't be going free. He'll be transferred to 
the Madison County Jail, where he faces new illegal gambling 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Madison County authorities allege that the 38-year-old  
Schlichter placed wagers with a Las Vegas bookie when he was jailed 
at the Correctional Industrial Facility in Pendleton last November. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Rodney Cummings issued warrants last week on four  
misdemeanor counts of illegal gambling stemming from the incidents. 
The case will be heard in Anderson City Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The four charges carry a maximum sentence of 180 days and a  
maximum $1,000 fine. If convicted, Schlichter could be ordered to 
serve consecutive sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlichter served two years and seven months behind bars -- less  
than half of his original sentence -- at the Pendleton facility. He 
took part in a Department of Correction program that rewards 
inmates who earn college degrees behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlichter has been in legal trouble for gambling-related  
activities since 1983, when the NFL suspended him for one year 
after learning bookies had threatened him over $150,000 in gambling 
debts. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlichter returned to the Indianapolis Colts in 1984 and was  
released following the 1985 season.

<HEADLINE> El Nino Not As Bad As Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For a while it seemed as though everything  
from tornadoes to toadstools and hailstorms to hemlines was being 
blamed on El Nino. Now, it turns out the periodic weather event 
produced a lot more good than bad. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the conclusion of climatologist Stanley A. Changnon, who  
calculated that while the 1997-98 El Nino can be blamed for 189 
deaths, it also can be credited with preserving 850 lives that 
would have been lost in normal winter and hurricane seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	And its $4.2 billion to $4.5 billion in damage is far outweighed  
by nearly $20 billion in benefits, Changnon reports in the 
September issue of the Bulletin of the American Meteorological 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you treat it as an economic outcome for the country ...  
most of the country benefited,'' Changnon said. 
</P>
<P>
	True, the El Nino weather phenomenon was blamed for major storms  
in California and, by some, for deadly tornadoes in Florida and an 
ice storm in the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	But it also produced an exceptionally mild winter in most of the  
Northern states and blocked Atlantic Coast hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I figured, just watching what was happening, that it was going  
to be a zero-sum game but it turned out far from that,'' Changnon 
said in a telephone interview from his Mahomet, Ill., home. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Glantz, an El Nino expert at the National Center for  
Atmospheric Research in Colorado, was skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a noble attempt but I wouldn't take the numbers to the  
bank,'' he said. ``I'm wary of trying to cost out weather events.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his paper, Changnon admitted there could be up to a 30  
percent variation in the costs and benefits cited, but noted that 
would still produce considerably more benefit than loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim O'Brien, director of the Center for Ocean-Atmosphere  
Prediction Studies at Florida State University, welcomed Changnon's 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	``El Nino is a good dude for the United States,'' O'Brien said  
in a telephone interview. ``In actuality, La Nina is worse for the 
United States, there are more hurricanes, there is an increase in 
tornadoes and they spread over a wider region ... there is 
drought,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	El Nino is a periodic warming of the water in the eastern  
Pacific Ocean, which shifts weather patterns arriving from that 
area and can affect the climate worldwide. La Nina, an abnormal 
cooling of the Pacific sea surface, is currently taking place. It, 
too, can affect the world's weather. La Ninas sometimes occur 
between El Ninos. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Changnon, as few as 100 people died in winter cold  
and storms during the 1997-98 El Nino, well below the average of 
850 in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Generally mild temperatures ``greatly reduced lives lost to  
extreme cold,'' Changnon wrote, and there also were fewer 
weather-related auto accidents and deaths in winter storms. 
</P>
<P>
	``El Nino's influence on the atmosphere led to the elimination  
of major Atlantic hurricanes during 1997,'' he added. That meant no 
lives lost compared to the average of 20 in recent years and it 
meant an enormous savings for home and business owners, governments 
and insurers. 
</P>
<P>
	The mild temperatures also saved businesses and homeowners  
millions of dollars they didn't have to spend on heating fuel, 
Changnon said, though that also can be calculated as a loss for 
utilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Lack of demand for heating fuel made oil a glut on the market,  
resulting in the price of gasoline dropping to as low as 80 cents a 
gallon in some parts of the country, O'Brien pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the economic benefits of the mild winter,  
Changnon reported, ``Thousands went out of doors more, millions 
went shopping, many altered their types of recreation, and almost 
everyone enjoyed better health than in normal winters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glantz raised the ``question of what is a normal year, which no  
one has defined. No one has calculated to the U.S. the cost of 
weather in a normal year. Extremes are going on every year,'' he 
commented. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's admirable that he tried to put numbers on this stuff,''  
Glantz concluded, but ``it's very hard to attribute weather 
events.''

<HEADLINE> Marshals Impound FBI Waco Evidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Previously undisclosed evidence in the FBI's  
1993 assault on the Branch Davidian cult near Waco, Texas, has been 
impounded by federal marshals as Justice Department officials begin 
seeking an outsider to conduct a new investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton wants an independent inquiry, White House  
spokesman Jake Siewert said today. ``The president is deeply 
concerned that the attorney general appears to have been misled and 
may have been lied to'' about what went on at Waco, Siewert said. 
</P>
<P>
	The marshals took custody of an infrared videotape recorded  
during the early morning of April 19, 1993, when FBI agents lobbed 
incendiary tear-gas canisters at a concrete bunker adjacent to the 
Davidians' compound, an FBI source said Wednesday, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after the incendiary canisters were fired, the wooden  
compound 50 yards away erupted in flames. Cult leader David Koresh 
and some 80 followers died during the inferno, some from gunshot 
wounds, others from the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI and Attorney General Janet Reno, who have been heavily  
criticized over the Waco tragedy, have said there was no evidence 
to suggest the blaze was set by the combustible canisters. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior Justice officials directed the marshals to seize the  
evidence Wednesday afternoon after being informed by the FBI that 
new information had been discovered in the files of the FBI's 
hostage rescue team at Quantico, Va., Justice and FBI officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	An audio track on the infrared tape picked up the voice of an  
agent seeking and receiving permission from a commander to fire 
incendiary tear-gas grenades at the bunker, an FBI source confirmed 
today, adding that nothing on the videotape conflicts with the 
FBI's position that the tear gas did not ignite the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno has decided upon an independent inquiry -- as recommended by  
the White House, the head of the FBI and several lawmakers -- 
instead of one run from within her department, the New York Times 
and The Washington Post reported. 
</P>
<P>
	An informal list of several potential outside candidates to head  
the probe was in circulation, and some of them have been contacted, 
a Justice source said Wednesday. Reno was out of the country on 
official business through today. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers said the fact that Justice dispatched marshals to  
seize evidence from the FBI -- which Justice officials characterized 
as a public rebuke -- further underlined the need for an independent 
probe. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just further evidence that the leadership of the FBI is  
giving the whole organization a needless black eye,'' Sen. Chuck 
Grassley, R-Iowa, who heads a Senate Judiciary subcommittee with 
FBI oversight, said in an interview. ``We've got a cowboy culture 
at the top of the organization that can easily impress you that 
their opinion is that they aren't responsible to anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., said: ``The spectacle created ... by the  
Department of Justice seizing evidence from one of its own agencies 
is further proof there is no substitute for a credible independent 
inquiry. The department has proven more than amply in the six years 
since the Waco incident that it is utterly incapable of policing 
itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Department sources said Reno and her top aides were angered at  
the latest twist in the newly resurgent Waco controversy. Just a 
week ago, the FBI was forced to retreat from six years of denials 
that it had used incendiary tear gas during the final hours of the 
51-day siege, which had begun in a bloody shootout when federal 
agents tried to arrest Koresh on weapons charges. 
</P>
<P>
	That belated admission about the incendiary tear gas has  
prompted an outcry on Capitol Hill, where congressional Republicans 
are readying hearings for the fall. A frustrated Reno also ordered 
an inquiry to determine why combustible tear gas was used against 
her orders. 
</P>
<P>
	Byron Sage, a retired FBI supervisor who was the agency's chief  
negotiator with Koresh during the standoff, said today Reno's 
orders were that incendiary gas not be used against the wooden 
compound for fear it would cause a fire. ``Those instructions were 
followed,'' Sage said on ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the latest disclosures, Sage said, ``The facts have  
not changed as far as what happened on the 19th of April or on the 
51-day effort prior to that. The military (incendiary) rounds that 
are in question were not directed toward the wooden structure -- 
that's a central issue that needs to be remembered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The newly uncovered Forward-Looking Infrared, or FLIR, tapes  
were turned up as part of FBI Director Louis Freeh's order that all 
files be searched for relevant information in advance of the 
investigation, the FBI source said. After the evidence was found, 
it was transferred to FBI headquarters in Washington, where the 
marshals took possession. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hostage Rescue Team was in charge of operations during the  
siege and the final tear-gas assault. 
</P>
<P>
	``Earlier this afternoon, senior main Justice Department  
officials learned from the FBI that the FBI had found additional 
materials in its possession regarding the shooting of military CS 
gas rounds on the morning of April 19,'' Justice spokesman Myron 
Marlin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice officials ``immediately directed the United States  
Marshals Service to take possession and inventory the materials,'' 
Marlin added. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI concurred, bureau spokesman John Collingwood said.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are anxious to identify and preserve for outside review and  
congressional oversight anything that may bear on the firing of the 
military gas rounds,'' Collingwood said. ``In the end, the only way 
we can completely restore our credibility is to identify every 
scrap of information we have and immediately turn it over to 
whomever is doing the review.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freeh, who wants to head off any perception of conflict of  
interest, earlier this week indicated support for an inquiry to be 
conducted without FBI or Justice Department involvement. Freeh took 
office more than four months after the 1993 fire.

<HEADLINE> Plantiffs Win 50 Percent of Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Individuals seeking damages in civil lawsuits  
had slightly better than a 50-50 chance of winning in cases 
resolved by a jury or a judge, according to government statistics 
released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs made up 52 percent of the winners in the 15,638 civil  
cases in 1996 that were decided by a jury or in bench trials. The 
cases, from the nation's 75 largest counties, were examined by the 
Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs in contract disputes enjoyed the most success,  
winning 62 percent of their cases. People who sued in tort cases 
such automobile accidents, vandalism and for medical malpractice 
won their cases 48 percent of the time. Plaintiffs in trials based 
on property lawsuits won 32 percent of the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, plaintiffs won 49 percent of jury trials during 1996,  
slightly less than the 52 percent who won their cases in 1992. 
Plaintiffs won 62 percent of cases decided by a judge in 1996. Data 
for bench trials was not collected in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Most civil cases are resolved before they reach the trial level,  
but the data from trial cases provided details about money awarded 
as damages. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, plaintiffs from the 75 largest counties who won their  
cases were awarded about $3 billion in compensatory and punitive 
damages. Slightly more than $2 billion was awarded in tort cases 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Half of all plaintiffs who won their cases were awarded $33,000  
or more. About 16 percent won more than $250,000 in total damages 
and an estimated 6 percent were awarded $1 million or more. 
</P>
<P>
	In several types of cases, such as in medical malpractice and  
employment discrimination, jurors were more likely than judges to 
award damages of at least $1 million.

<HEADLINE> Mo Vaughn: Why I Din't Join Brawl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Mo Vaughn said he didn't join his Angels'  
teammates in a bench-clearing brawl with the Cleveland Indians 
because he wasn't in the dugout when the altercation started. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in brawls all my career,'' Vaughn said before  
Anaheim's 8-1 loss Wednesday to Cleveland. ``If I was down on the 
bench, I would have been in the brawl. But I was in the clubhouse 
watching the game on TV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The brawl took place after Angels reliever Troy Percival gave up  
a three-run homer in the eighth inning Tuesday to Richie Sexson, 
capping a 10-run rally by the Indians, who won the game 14-12. 
</P>
<P>
	Percival then hit David Justice, igniting the fight as both  
benches and bullpens emptied. Both Percival and Justice were 
ejected. 
</P>
<P>
	After the fight, Percival suggested that not all of his  
teammates were willing to join him in the brawl. When asked to be 
specific, he said ``Look at the tape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A television camera showed Vaughn, who was the designated hitter  
and wasn't on the field for the fight, watching as order was 
restored from the corner of the Anaheim dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn not only defended himself but criticized Percival for  
hitting Justice. ``Be like a man,'' he said. ``You get rapped 
around, don't throw at a guy. Get the next guy out and get out of 
the inning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Batting instructor Rod Carew brought Vaughn and Percival  
together for a short meeting that seemed to bring the matter to a 
close. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mo and I are fine, there's no problem there,'' Percival said.  
``To me, it's a non-issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Vaughn nor Percival played Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Record Number Held Back in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- More than 21,000 students in the nation's  
largest school system will be forced to repeat a grade because they 
failed tests at the end of summer school, didn't take the required 
tests or never attended the summer classes at all. 
</P>
<P>
	When summer school results were first announced on Aug. 20,  
School Chancellor Rudy Crew said most of the children who attended 
summer school had passed their tests and would move on to the next 
grade. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, officials revealed that 14,000 of the 35,000  
students who had been told to attend summer school skipped the 
tests or never showed up at all. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were trying to funnel the information as we got it,'' said  
Karen Crowe, a Crew spokeswoman. ``There was nothing sinister 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1.1 million-student school system doesn't have a  
computerized system for tracking summer school attendance, Crew 
aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	Crew said Wednesday he will stand by his decision to fail the  
students -- more than 7,000 who failed the tests and the 14,000 who 
never attended summer school or dropped out before taking the 
tests. He has been a critic of social promotion, the practice of 
promoting students within their age group even if they are failing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The answer has to be very swift,'' Crew said. ``If you fail to  
go, if you take and ultimately do not pass the test, you will be 
held back.''

<HEADLINE> Packers' Bidwell Out for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Rookie punter Josh Bidwell needs further  
treatment for testicular cancer and will miss the 1999 season, 
Green Bay Packers GM Ron Wolf said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bidwell underwent surgery Wednesday, which appeared to be  
successful. But Wolf said early pathology results confirmed the 
punter will not be able to return in 2-4 weeks, as some published 
reports indicated. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers made the announcement moments before the start of  
their preseason game against the Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	``The prognosis is excellent,'' Wolf said. ``We expect him to be  
100 percent for the 2000 campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bidwell, the Packers' fourth-round draft pick from Oregon and  
the first punter drafted in 1999, was the only punter on Green 
Bay's roster. He also had been the primary holder for placekicker 
Ryan Longwell. 
</P>
<P>
	He practiced with the team Tuesday. Bidwell apparently noticed  
something was wrong a couple of days ago, reported it to a doctor 
and had an ultrasound exam Wednesday, resulting in the decision to 
do the surgery the same day. 
</P>
<P>
	``As more definitive results are available, a more specific  
treatment plan will be established,'' Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers claimed first-year punter Chris Hanson on waivers  
from the Cleveland Browns Wednesday to fill in for Bidwell. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Packers kept Bidwell as their only punter even  
though he hadn't lived up to expectations in exhibition games. Then 
he had his best performance last weekend at New Orleans, averaging 
43.5 yards on six punts. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-3 Bidwell's size and athleticism, along with his  
booming 46.0 yards-per-punt averaged during his senior season at 
Oregon, convinced the Packers to spend a fourth-round pick on him.

<HEADLINE> Hatch Denies Special Help for Kim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch did nothing out of  
the ordinary to help John Kim obtain permanent U.S. residency and 
nothing came of the effort, a spokeswoman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim, son of influential International Olympic Committee member  
Un-yong Kim, was indicted in the Salt Lake bribery scandal 
Wednesday for immigration fraud and lying to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch, who is seeking the Republican nomination for the  
presidency, was thrust into the scandal by Kim's lawyers in New 
York City, who reacted to the indictment by releasing an excerpt of 
a letter they said former Salt Lake bid president Tom Welch wrote 
to Kim. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter said Hatch in 1991 was ``prepared to provide special  
legislation if necessary to overcome any problems that John may 
have on his green card,'' according to Kim's lawyers, who refused 
Thursday to release a copy of the letter. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch spokeswoman Heather Barney said the senator has only a  
vague recollection of Kim, and only advised Welch on immigration 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch wouldn't comment himself because ``he is not willing to  
get in the middle of this mess,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch only rarely introduces legislation that would exempt a  
person from immigration rules. In pending congressional action, 
Hatch is helping obtain a green card for a woman with multiple 
sclerosis who had been facing deportation to Iran, Barney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, never  
introduced special legislation for Kim and doesn't recall being 
asked to do it, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim ended up getting his own green card or permanent resident  
visa. He was indicted Wednesday for fraudulently obtaining the 
document and using it 16 times to enter the United States from 1995 
to 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	A warrant was issued for his arrest, but Kim had returned to  
South Korea and said last week that he surrendered his visa at the 
U.S. embassy there. His wife and two children remain at a residence 
on New York's Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Kim held a ``sham'' job with Keystone  
Communications of Salt Lake City that didn't entitle him to a green 
card. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the charges, he was put on the Keystone payroll by  
the Salt Lake Bid Committee as part of a scheme to help him obtain 
his green card and to influence his father to vote for Salt Lake's 
successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim's lawyers said the Justice Department has a copy of Welch's  
letter, but Justice spokeswoman Carole Florman wouldn't confirm 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't talk about specific pieces of evidence until we get  
to court,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim's indictment was the second criminal case to grow out of the  
Olympic scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 3, Salt Lake City businessman David E. Simmons pleaded  
guilty to a federal misdemeanor tax charge. Simmons admitted he 
created Kim's bogus job at Keystone and was reimbursed by Kim 
himself and the Salt Lake Bid Committee for his salary. 
</P>
<P>
	Florman said the federal investigation is still active and will  
go ``wherever the evidence leads.''
