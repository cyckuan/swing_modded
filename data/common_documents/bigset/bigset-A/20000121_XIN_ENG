<HEADLINE> New UNESCO Head Pledges Priority to Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Asia-Pacific countries should
focus on reaching the unreached and improving the quality of
learning in terms of basic education, Koichiro Matsuura, Director-
General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO), said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Matsuura made the comment Thursday at the closing ceremony of
the four-day Asia-Pacific Conference on Education for All (EFA)
2000 Assessment, which reviewed the gains and obstacles to the EFA
goals, set by the landmark World Conference on Education for All
held in Thailand in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The conference noted that the region has made dramatic
achievements, especially in primary school enrollment, early
childhood education and illiteracy elimination.
</P>
<P>
However, some countries are still lagging behind due to
political instability, rapid population growth and economic
difficulties, according to Matsuura.
</P>
<P>
He pledged to give "absolute priority" to basic education
during his six-year term as the head of UNESCO. Matsuura was
elected UNESCO Director-General in November 1999.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 delegates from 41 countries attending the
conference agreed that greater political priority and funding for
basic education in the Asia-Pacific should be the bedrock for a
regional basic education strategy for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference after the closing ceremony, Kul Gautam,
Regional Director of United Nations Children's Fund, one of the co-
organizers of the conference, also stressed the importance to give
priority to education.
</P>
<P>
He lashed out on countries which "mobilize billions of U.S.
dollars a day for (the bombing of) Kosovo," instead of pouring
more money into education.
</P>
<P>
Gautam expressed concerns that some Asian countries reduced
education budget and increased military expenditures, noting that
military spending in Asia went up last year to 130 billion dollars
as a result.
</P>
<P>
To better address the EFA issue, the conference adopted a draft
framework for regional action to ensure quality learning to every
child, youth and adult without discriminating between boys and
girls, men and women, rich and poor, towns and villages.
</P>
<P>
The plan will be debated at the national level before being
finalized as a regional EFA strategy, which will feed into global
framework for action expected to be adopted at the World Education
Forum to be held in Dakar, Senegal between April 26 and 28.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Chief Executive
General Pervaiz Musharraf Thursday called upon all ministries of
his government to expeditiously identify new projects in the field
of economic cooperation to make use of the generous Chinese offer
for assistance.
</P>
<P>

visit to Beijing.
</P>
<P>

the assistance available under the "friendly and generous" support
of the government of China.

<HEADLINE> HIV Infection Spreads Rapidly in Vietnam's Northern Provinces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 20 (Xinhua) -- HIV /AIDS Infection has been
spreading rapidly in Vietnam's northern provinces, Vietnam News
Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A conference reviewing HIV/AIDS control in northern localities
in 1999 has sounded the alarm that the virus has been spreading
fast in the northern cities and provinces since 1998, particularly
in Hanoi,Hai Phong, Son La, Quang Ninh and Bac Ninh.
</P>
<P>
It was also reported at the conference that almost 66 percent
of the newly-discovered cases were drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
A total of 5,827 HIV carriers were detected nationwide in 1999,
and the number of HIV-positive cases detected by January 7 had
reached 17,150, of whom 2,972 had developed AIDS and 1,551 had
died.
</P>
<P>
It is particularly worrisome that around half of the HIV
carriers are under 30 years old.
</P>
<P>
The National AIDS Committee of Vietnam plans to set up funds to
support HIV/AIDS control activities in a number of organizations
and localities, and raise funds from the community, economic
branches,mass organizations, and religious organizations for the
task, said the committee's Vice Chairman Chung A at the two-day
conference which opened in Hanoi on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> China -- Model in Basic Education Development: UNESCO Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 20 (Xinhua) - China is a model country in many
ways in developing basic education, Victor Ordonez, Director of
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO)Principal Regional Office for Asia and the
Pacific, told Xinhua Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"In the past 20 years, China has done the nearly miraculous
feat of moving participation in schools from 30 to 40 percent to
over 95 percent," he said after the closing ceremony of the Asia-
Pacific Conference on Education For All 2000 Assessment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The conference reviewed the gains and obstacles in the Asia-
Pacific region to the goals of basic education set by the World
Conference on Education for All held in Thailand 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Ordonez said China has become a country that helps others in
terms of basic education, noting that UNESCO has sent a large
number of literacy directors from Nepal, Pakistan and other Asia-
Pacific countries to China to learn from it.
</P>
<P>
China's success in basic education should be attributed to the
strong political message from the central government to rural
villages, the continuity of leadership, the participation of local
community and the long tradition of strong respect for education
in its culture, Ordonez said.
</P>
<P>
"Once a UNESCO project gets approval from the Chinese
authorities and begins running, it is sure to finish; and once it
is finished, it is sure to continue and expand," Ordonez said.
</P>
<P>
He gave an example he encountered in China's northeastern Jilin
Province, saying a UNESCO project helping build seven schools in
the province has expanded to 24 schools and then to more than 200
schools by the provincial authorities without UNESCO's assistance.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for China's impressive achievement in basic
education is the smooth transition for children from pre-school
education to school study, he said.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the pre-school education system, namely kindergartens,
nurseries and day care centers, children in China face little
problem in adapting themselves to the school environment, Ordonez
said.
</P>
<P>
The UNESCO regional chief was also impressed by China's
protection of minority languages, saying it is very important to
the protection of minority nationalities themselves.
</P>
<P>
Despite the achievements, China still faces challenges as the
country has the world's highest number of out-of-school children,
which account for 4.2 percent of the country's 1.2 billion
population,Ordonez said.
</P>
<P>
There are also large disparity between coastal and inland
regions in terms of basic education, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, China has been aware of the problem and is
taking measures to overcome it.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Help Cyprus Solve Water Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. water experts will work
with their Greek and Turkish Cypriot counterparts to solve the
long-standing problem of water shortage on the island of Cyprus,
said a Cyprus official on Friday.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus Donald Bandler,
Cyprus Minister of Agriculture, Natural Sources and Environment
Costas Themistocleous said the water shortage issue is faced
equally by both communities on the island.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government is ready to contribute to promoting
bicommunal works to deal with the problem, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
While describing his meeting with Themistocleous as "useful and
productive", Bandler expressed U.S. willingness to help Cyprus find
a solution to the issue, adding that several ideas are under
consideration.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot and the
Turkish Cypriot communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake a failed pro-
Athens coup in Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> London The Costliest City In Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- London has become the most
expensive city in the European Union and the seventh in the world,
according to an international survey published Friday.
</P>
<P>
London first entered the world's top 10 most expensive places
in December 1997. The rise from ninth to 70th position in the
rankings over the past year is blamed mainly on the strong pound
and the relative weakness of the euro.
</P>
<P>
Bill Ridgers, the editor of the survey, said the results would
be taken as further evidence of the poor deal enjoyed by British
consumers compared to their European counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Business leaders voiced concern that rising living costs in
London are undermining the city's long-term economic prospects.
</P>
<P>
The most expensive cities globally are Tokyo and Osaka, which
have borne this distinctions since 1991. Japan's recent economic
recovery means Tokyo is now 30 percent more expensive than Hong
Kong, in third place.
</P>
<P>
The cheapest place to live in Europe is Bucharest, which is in
120th place. The two Indian cities of Delhi and Bombay have
usurped Tripoli in Libya as the cheapest in the world. They are
four times as cheap as Tokyo.

<HEADLINE> Italy to Provide 16 Million U.S. Dollars For Homeless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government will
provide 30 billion lire (about 16 million U.S. dollars) to help
the country's homeless this year, Italian Social and Family
Affairs Minister Livia Turco announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the end of a cabinet meeting to discuss the
homeless problem, Turco said that the money would be used to fight
the growing phenomenon in nine cities: Rome, Milan, Naples,
Palermo, Venice, Genoa, Bologna, Turin and Bari.
</P>
<P>
"The decision is an exceptional one. We owe it to those people
in difficulty and those who dedicate their lives to trying to
alleviate their problems. I would like to stress that this is the
first time in Italy that there has been a focus on this category
of people," she said.
</P>
<P>
She added that the money would be managed by the city councils
to boost the resources of public and voluntary organizations
working with the homeless and provide health care for those that
are sick.
</P>
<P>
"In this way, the homeless will be guaranteed shelter, a meal
and medical assistance," Turco said.
</P>
<P>
The plight of Italy's homeless population was highlighted this
month by the death in Rome of seven people in as many days.
</P>
<P>
The Vatican subsequently announced that four churches would be
used for handing out 500 meals a day to vagrants and the poor
starting at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Official estimates put the number of homeless in the capital
alone at 1,800 but charity groups insist that the real figure is
at least double that.

<HEADLINE> Russia Declares Nine Polish Diplomats Persona Non Grata </HEADLINE>

<P>
MOSCOW, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia Friday evening declared
nine members of the Polish embassy in Moscow "persona non grata"
and demanded they must leave Russia before January 28.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Polish ambassador to Russia received a
corresponding note at the Russian Foreign Ministry, which accounts
the decision to the activities of the diplomats incompatible with
their status and provisions of the Vienna Convention.
</P>
<P>
The move was a reply to the Thursday demarche of the Polish
government that expelled nine Russian diplomats from the embassy
in Warsaw.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Russia
will adopt the "most ruthless adequate measures" in response to
Poland's expulsion of Russian diplomats. He described Warsaw's
actions as "an unprovoked provocation."
</P>
<P>
"It is hard to say now whether the decision was adopted
immediately in Warsaw or by anyone's prompting. But in any case
the step injects an additional complexity in our relations with
Poland," Ivanov said.

<HEADLINE> Government Troops Trap Rebels in W. Uganda: Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Uganda People's Defense
Forces have surrounded the bases of the Allied Democratic Forces
(ADF) rebels in the western part of the country, a senior army
commander has said.
</P>
<P>
Chief of Staff of the People's Defense Forces, James Kazini,
told reporters in the western town of Bundibugyo that the
government troops can finish off the rebels very soon.
</P>
<P>
But he did not give any deadline, the Radio Uganda reported on
Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
A combined team of the government army and local defense units
have surrounded the ADF bases in the Rwenzori Mountains in their
Mountain Sweep Operation.
</P>
<P>
The commander said that over 60 ADF rebels have been killed and
many others captured by the government troops.
</P>
<P>
The Military High Command has sent reinforcement to the region
to ensure the safety of local residents and military barracks.
</P>
<P>
Last December, about 200 ADF rebels entered Uganda from the
Democratic Republic of the Congo to abduct and kill.
</P>
<P>
They attacked both civilian and security targets. More than 25
people were killed in their latest attack on a camp for the
displaced people.
</P>
<P>
The ADF rebels have been operating in the region since 1996.
They burnt more than 80 students to death in a surprise pre-dawn
attack on a technical college in the region in June of 1998,
committing the most infamous atrocity in the history.

remaining constraints that hamper private sector development in
the east African country.
</P>
<P>
Museveni assured private entrepreneurs that efforts would be

Meanwhile, he also urged the private sector to consider
strategic exploitation of the local abundant raw materials in
their industries so as to increase the country's competitiveness
on the international market.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Reverses Negative Economic Growth in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Preliminary data show that the
Zambian economy grew by two percent in 1999 compared with a two
percent negative growth in 1998, President Frederick Chiluba said
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba attributed the positive growth mainly to good
performance in transport and communication, energy, tourism and
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
However, the president noted that the four percent growth rate
anticipated at the beginning of last year was not realized due to
the declining contribution of the mining industry to the economy.
</P>
<P>
The mining industry contributed less to the economy due to low
volume of production caused mainly by the delays in privatizing
the remaining major assets of the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines
(ZCCM), and low copper prices.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said that his government will continue to promote
private section participation in the national economic
development.

<HEADLINE> Poor Nations Urged to Join in Globalization Trend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister
Frederick Sumaye Friday urged the poor countries like Tanzania to
actively join in the globalization trend.
</P>
<P>
It is useless to simply complain on the negative impact of the
globalization and the inequitable global trading system, Sumaye
said at a seminar on globalization in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Potential marginalization of the least developed countries
needs to be critically addressed as the world faces the new
economic trend of globalization, the prime minister noted.
</P>
<P>
The least developed countries should fight for better deal,
improve quantity and quality of the export and increase investment
in infrastructure and spending in the social sectors, Sumaye
stressed.
</P>
<P>
There is a need for a country like Tanzania to have requisite
technical capacity to analyze trade-related issues and make sound
trade and investment policies.
</P>
<P>
As the world faces the challenge of globalization, the least
developed countries' share in the world exports and imports
continues to fall down sharply.
</P>
<P>
The poor nations have also attracted a negligible share of
global flow of foreign investment and remain heavily dependent on
official development assistance to finance a large share of their
investment, the Tanzanian prime minister pointed out.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak decided on Friday to send Israeli experts to Washington to
report to the U.S. Administration about Israel's reactions to the
U.S.-drafted working document on the Syrian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
However, Barak has not decided on the makeup of the Israeli
expert team which is expected to arrive in Washington next week,
the Prime Minister's Office said.
</P>
<P>
The "working document" was prepared by the U.S. during the
second round of Israeli-Syrian peace talks held earlier this month
at Shepherdstown, West Virginia, the United States.
</P>
<P>
The document outlined the differences between the Israeli and
Syrian sides on all key issues that have been discussed during the
talks and suggestions by the U.S. for their settlement.
</P>
<P>
The key issues include borders, water, security arrangements and
normalization of ties between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria postponed their third round of peace talks
indefinitely which were scheduled for Wednesday in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
To push peace talks on the Syrian-Israeli track forward, the U.
S. has decided to ask the two countries to send experts to
Washington to report their comments and reactions to the document
and discuss the new date for the next round of talks.

<HEADLINE> Putin, Fischer Emphasize Importance of Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Acting Russian President and
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and German Vice-Chancellor and
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer stressed here Friday the
importance of bilateral relations, expressing the common wish to
further strengthen cooperation between their countries.
</P>
<P>
Russia has always attached much importance to the expansion of
cooperation with Germany and Europe as a whole, Putin said at a
Kremlin meeting with Fischer.
</P>
<P>
"Even several years ago the relations of Russia and Germany
could be regarded as a model, but unfortunately our cooperation
has slowed down lately," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Both Germany and Russia have reasons to count on a positive
development of bilateral relations," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
Fischer stated, in his turn, that German-Russian ties are of
vital importance and Berlin agrees with Moscow on fighting
terrorism in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"The German leadership does not contest Russia's rights and
duties to make efforts to combat international terrorism and
terrorism in Chechnya," he said.
</P>
<P>
Any isolation of Russia is dangerous, Fischer said at a Friday
evening meeting with the leadership of the Russian Memorial human
rights' group.
</P>
<P>
The meeting focused on the present state and prospects of a
civil society in Russia and the developments in Chechnya,
according to leading Memorial member Arseni Roginsky.
</P>
<P>
Roginsky said human right activists spoke for the permanent
presence of an international observer mission with broad powers in
the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
He explained the meeting by long-standing relations between
Memorial and the German Green Party to which Fischer belongs.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Clean Up Sloppy Paperwork After Mishandling Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian Department of Human
Resources Development is launching reform measures to clean up the
sloppy paperwork reported to have resulted in huge gaps of 1
billion Canadian dollars (about 691.2 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Announcing the reforms, Human Resources Minister Jane Steward
said in a statement made public Friday that "it's about making
sure we improve our management practices."
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after a recent audit found huge gaps in
job creation funds that the minister has acknowledged could open
the door to questions whether the funds were improperly spent,
according to the local media.
</P>
<P>
Reform measures include a two-tier performance pay scheme for
executives to intensify their work at the problem.
</P>
<P>
The department will also beef up training, conduct spot audits
across the country and use new computer programs to simplify the
management.

<HEADLINE> Greece: Simitis' Visit to Turkey Impossible at Present </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Greece Friday declined an
invitation by Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit towards his
Greek counterpart, Costas Simitis, for an official visit to the
neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that the Turkish premier's invitation
demonstrated a desire for bilateral communication at the highest
level, although such a meeting was not possible at present.
</P>
<P>
An answer would be forwarded to the Turkish government via
diplomatic channels, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit extended the invitation to Simitis during his meeting
with Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou in Ankara Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have closely gone to war
three times in the past 25 years over their territorial disputes
in the Aegean Sea and the Cyprus problem, but the two countries
have since late June begun to take some positive steps to improve
their strained relations.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou's three-day official visit to Turkey, the first by a
Greek foreign minister since 1962, signals the coming of a new era
in the relations between the two long-time rivals.
</P>
<P>
In Ankara, Papandreou signed with his Turkish counterpart,
Ismail Cem, four agreements for bilateral cooperation on tourism,
investment, security and the environment, and Cem will also visit
Athens in early February to sign the rest of the 10 cooperation
agreements.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Reply to Poland's Provocation Will Be Tough: Ivanov </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov late Friday warned that Moscow's response to Warsaw's "
provocation of expulsion of nine Russian diplomats will be most
tough."
</P>
<P>
Russia will adopt the "most ruthless adequate measures" in
response to Poland's expulsion of nine Russian diplomats," Ivanov
told a press conference held Friday at the end of his German
counterpart Joschka Fishcher's visit to Russia.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said the Polish government's decision "of course
disappointed us." He described Warsaw's actions as "an unprovoked
provocation."
</P>
<P>
"Russia has not (been) and will not be blind to such
provocation," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Russian minister noted that the Polish leadership's
decision came after "the Russian government discussed at a session
a set of measures on broadening relations with Central and East
European countries."
</P>
<P>
"This year we have planned serious steps in relations with
Poland, too," Ivanov said, adding that "a whole number of top-
level political contacts and a number of other steps" are in the
offing.
</P>
<P>
The minister said "the well-known action followed from Poland
in response to that." "It is hard to say now whether the decision
was adopted immediately in Warsaw or by any one's prompting. But
whatever they were, the step injects an additional complexity in
our relations with Poland," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that "the Polish leadership would serious
consider the situation and act in the interests of bilateral
relations and European stability."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, Russian Foreign Ministry sources said Moscow
may make an appropriate response Friday to Poland's pronouncement
of nine Russian diplomats as "persona non grata" due to alleged
spying activities.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Ministry warned the Polish government
Thursday that "a response is unavoidable in such situations."
</P>
<P>
However, Moscow may react Saturday "due to technical reasons,"
said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Poland's expulsion of Russian diplomats "demonstrates its
sycophancy toward NATO (the North Atlantic Treaty Organization),"
said the Foreign Ministry sources.
</P>
<P>
So called "friendly special services" even gave out some of the
Russian diplomats' names, the sources said.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The French city Strasbourg will
set up by 2004 a cultural center on Yiddish, the Germanic language
spoken by Ashkenazic Jews in eastern and central Europe, reported
Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
The city hall of Strasbourg said Friday that the center will be
built on the site of an old cinema in central Strasbourg and will
have classrooms teaching Yiddish, a small theater, a meeting hall,
exhibition rooms and a multimedia library.
</P>
<P>
Yiddish was spoken by 11 million people in Europe before the
outbreak of World War II in 1939.
</P>
<P>
The language was almost extinct in Europe at the end of the war
because of systematic extermination of Jews by Nazis.

<HEADLINE> Study: One in Five Marriages in Greece Ends in Divorce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 21 (Xinhua) -- One in five marriages in Greece
ends in divorce, according to a study by Greece's National
Statistics Service (NSS).
</P>
<P>
The rate of divorce is even higher in major cities around the
country, including the capital of Athens and the northern Greek
city of Thessaloniki, where one in three marriages ends in divorce,
the Athens daily newspaper Athens News reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Local experts warn that the country's divorce rate has
increased sharply in the past years. Between 1991 and 1995, the
divorce rate was estimated at 10 percent nationwide, but this rose
to 20.6 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In Athens, a total of 7,450 couples tied the knot in 1999 while
some 2,119 others divorced; this represents an increase of around
17 percent in the number of divorces in the capital compared to
previous years.
</P>
<P>
In Greece, the proportion of people who remarried for a second
time has since 1985 been on the rise, with as many as 85 percent
of people who divorce remarry a second time, and around 15 percent
of them remarry their former spouses.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Greece's divorce rate is far behind those in other
European countries, where for every two marriages there is one
divorce, but experts warn that this may soon be the case in Greece
too.

<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 21 (Xinhua) -- United Nations (UN) High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Sadako Ogata on Friday described
the plight of Burundi's refugees as "horrifying", South African
Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
"There are about 20,000 new refugees. Their stories are quite
horrifying. Government is putting people in camps," Ogata told
reporters after discussing with South African President Mbeki
about Africa's refugee crisis.
</P>
<P>
Ogata, who arrived in South Africa Wednesday, added that she was
"very pleased" with recently-appointed mediator Nelson Mandela's
new impetus to Burundi's peace talks and his condemnation of the
camps.
</P>
<P>
UN officials say that about 340,000 civilians have been forced
into camps in Burundi since 1993 in the civil war, which has
killed some 200,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Ogata is also expected to attend a meeting of the Informal
Advisory Group held in South Africa, a body formed in 1995 of
eminent international personalities to support the UNHCR's efforts
to assist the world's refugees.

<HEADLINE> 4,000 Angolan Refugees in Namibia to Be Repatriated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LUANDA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Some 4,000 Angolan refugees in
Namibia will be repatriated by the end of March, official source
said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Angolan Minister of Assistance and Social Reintegration Albino
Malungo told the National Radio station that his ministry is
currently making preparations for the repatriation of the
refugees.
</P>
<P>
According to Malungo, those refugees flowed into the Namibian
territory for dodging the rampant conflicts between the Angolan
government troops and the rebel soldiers of the National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) led by Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Malungo said that his ministry will dispatch in the following
days a mission to Namibia for discussing with the Namibian
government issues on the transportation of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that it could be difficult for some
refugees to come back to homeland with their goods, because they
had lost the goods when they were sent to Alzir by a humanitarian
organization subordinate to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
According to the source, due to the fierce conflicts, the
number of the Angolan refugees living in the Namibian city of
Alzir is far more than before, saying that before the burst of
conflict in the Angolan provinces of Cunene and Cuando Cubango,
there were 7,000 Angolans living in the city.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Sees Higher Inflation in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Inflation in Mozambique for 1999
was 4.8 percent, compared with a minus 1.3 percent in 1998,
according to the Mozambican National Statistics Institute.
</P>
<P>
But this inflation was entirely the result of price hikes
during the festive season late last year, the independent news
sheet "Metical" said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in 1999, the trend had been deflationary. Prices, as
measured by the Maputo Consumer Price Index, were actually
falling.
</P>
<P>
For the 12 month period from November 1998 to October 1999, the
rate of inflation was minus 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The December rise in prices was concentrated in the category
"food, drink and tobacco", where the increase was 7.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Essentially, this was due to the Christmas and New Year
holidays.
</P>
<P>
Taking 1999 as a whole, the category "food, drink and tobacco"
rose in price by 2.3 percent. This is the main determinant in the
overall rate of inflation since this category accounts for
slightly more than 75 percent of the basket of goods and services
used in calculating the consumer price index.
</P>
<P>
There was a 1.1 percent increase in the price of transport and
communications, and a 2.6 percent rise in the category of
"education, culture and recreation".

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) will try to do a better job to
help refugees in Africa, a senior UNHCR official said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Assistant High Commissioner Soren Jessen Petersen told a
briefing that the UNHCR would show greater concern to refugees and
the displaced in Africa in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Petersen said some 300 million U.S. dollars was budgeted for
the year 2000 to assist refugees in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR official is on a tour to African countries in
connection with his organization's plans for African continent in
the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
According to Petersen, the number of refugees in need of
assistance in Africa has reduced to about six million from seven
million last year.
</P>
<P>
The African countries where refugee problems are fairly
protruding include Sudan, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, Burundi, Angola and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The whole world has about 21.5 million refugees and displaced
people, the UNHCR said in its latest report.
</P>
<P>
Despite UNHCR's efforts, Petersen noted, the refugee problems
could not be solved unless regional conflicts are stopped and
solved by peaceful means.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Senior banking experts said
here today they believe the future looks good for the Asian
economy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar sponsored by the Hong Kong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation and another Hong Kong bank, senior economist
Stephen King and some other experts said they were optimistic
about the Asian economy for year 2000 and beyond as the global
economy is growing strong.
</P>
<P>
But King warned that the U.S. economy has been periodically
unstable and the sustained drop in the American stock market will
lead to a "hard landing" of the American economy in 2001, similar
to that of the Japanese economy in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
But some experts from the bank pointed out that the impact of
the recession in some economies on the global economy has been
exaggerated, for example, the influence of Japan's recession on
the world economy in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
They also believe the Chinese currency will remain stable.
</P>
<P>
Over 200 experts from overseas-funded enterprises, banks,

<HEADLINE> IAEA Inspectors Arrive in Baghdad on Routine Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 21 (Xinhua) -- A five-member team of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) arrived here Friday to
carry out the first routine inspection of Iraq's uranium stockpile
in more than a year.
</P>
<P>
The inspections are part of world-wide monitoring of nuclear
facilities by the Vienna-based U.N. agency and are not directly
related to the stormy U.N. campaign to disarm Iraq after the 1991
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
IAEA said earlier this month that although all weapon-usable
materials have been removed from Iraq in accordance with U.N.
resolutions adopted after the Gulf War, Iraq still has about 1.8
tons of low enriched uranium and several tons of natural and
depleted uranium.
</P>
<P>
This IAEA team is to conduct its mission in line with the Treaty
on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and has the
limited objective of verifying the nuclear materials, said IAEA.
</P>
<P>
U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq, of which IAEA was in charge of
the nuclear file, have been suspended since December 1998 when the
U.S.and Britain launched an air campaign against Iraqi targets to
retaliate what they said Iraq's non-cooperation with inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's cooperation with IAEA had been smooth before the U.S.-
British air war against it, and IAEA declared in its report to the
U.N. Security Council in October 1998 that it had found no evidence
that Iraq had produced nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The IAEA team is scheduled to begin its work at the end of this
week and return to Vienna by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted the resolution 1284 last
December requiring Iraq to allow a new arms control body to return
to the country in exchange of possible suspension of the sanctions
imposed on Iraq following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The resolution has yet to be implemented amid rejection from
Iraq and differences within the Security Council over choosing the
head of the new regime -- the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and
Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC).

<HEADLINE> Palestinians to Build Airport in Jericho </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 21 (Xinhua)-- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) is planning to build a new airport near the West
Bank city of Jericho, according to the Palestinian Aviation
Authority(PAA).
</P>
<P>
The airport will be built near Jericho even without an approval
from the Israeli side, Israel Radio quoted a PAA official as saying
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the signed agreements between PNA and Israel, the PNA is
entitled to have two airports, one in Gaza Strip and the other in
the West Bank, the official added.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has selected the West Bank city of Bethlehem or Jenin to
build the new airport, but all these plans have been rejected by
Israel, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He did not say when the construction work will begin, but said
Jericho has been picked up by the PAA for the new airport.

NEW DELHI, January 21 (Xinhua) -- India said on Friday that its
dialogue with the U.S. and other countries on nuclear issue is "

<P>
OTTAWA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Vancouver is to launch a five-
day campaign against syphilis outbreak Monday as "a North American
first," the National Post newspaper said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry of the country's western province of
British Columbia is bracing for a mass-treatment targeting at 8,
000 people at Vancouver's tough downtown east side.
</P>
<P>
Health-care workers will provide a new antibiotic called
azithromycin to prostitutes and their partners both at "harassment-
free drop-in clinics" and on the city's toughest streets, said the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The move is intended to head off a "five-fold" increase over
the last few years in rates of the sexually transmitted disease,
which can lead to blindness, mental illness and death, local
health officials were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Cases in the province have risen to 100 in both 1998 and 1999,
as compared with 16 to 18 recorded for previous years. The bulk of
the problem is in the Vancouver region, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Green-Faced Terracotta Warrior Makes His Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, January 21 (Xinhua) -- A green-faced terracotta warrior
made his debut in the Museum of Terracotta Warriors and Horses in
Xi'an today, easy to spot among his grey-colored comrades-in-arms
crafted more than 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The soldier with the green face was discovered last year in the
2nd pit of the tomb of Emperor Qin Shihuang, the first emperor of
China in the Qin Dynasty (221-206 BC).
</P>
<P>
"This is the only green-faced warrior we have found since over
1,300 terracotta warriors were unearthed over the past two decades.
The other warriors have pink faces," said Wu Yongqi, curator of
the museum in Xi'an, capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists were surprised to find the warrior, who is posed
in a kneeling position and shooting an arrow. His face has a green
cast, while his hair and eyes are black.
</P>
<P>
Some experts have concluded that the green face is simply a
craftsman's mistake, but others believe that the warrior was made
to represent another race with a different color skin. No theories
have been verified.
</P>
<P>
"Emperor Qin Shihuang himself was a man beyond comprehension.
The terracotta warriors have yet to be studied by experts," said
Wu Yongqi.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists say the terracotta figurines were decorated in
many colors including red, green, blue, yellow, purple and brown
over 2,000 years ago. But because of technological problems, most
of the figurines lost their colors.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and German scientists have developed a technique to
prevent the color of the terracotta warriors from fading.
</P>
<P>
Qin Shihuang's tomb has been called "the eighth wonder of the
world." The terracotta warriors and horses were discovered in
Lintong County of Shaanxi Province in 1974. Since then, more than
100 chariots, 600 clay horses, 8,000 clay warriors and a large
number of ancient weapons have been unearthed in three huge pits.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Senate President Backs Rule in Jimenez Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Senate President Blas
Ople has urged a thorough review of the country's extradition
treaties with other states even as he expressed his support for
the Supreme Court's recent ruling on the Jimenez extradition,
Philippine News Agency said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The High Tribunal recently upheld the right of Mark Jimenez,
former Presidential Adviser on Latin American Affairs, to be
furnished all documents from the United States which seeks his
extradition to face American courts on a host of cases filed
against him.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has accused Jimenez of tax evasion, mail
fraud and illegal contributions to the political campaign of U.S.
President Bill Clinton, among others.
</P>
<P>
Jimenez won the initial round of his legal battle when the
Supreme Court decreed the other day that he has the right to see
and read the charges against him which the Department of Justice
has withheld purportedly in accordance with he terms of the
Philippine-U.S.Extradition Treaty.
</P>
<P>
In supporting the Supreme Court's decision, Ople said the
Tribunal is right in upholding a Filipino citizen's "basic due
process rights over the government's ironclad duties under a
treaty."
</P>
<P>
He said the High Court's precedent-setting ruling "provides an
armor to any Filipino citizen who is the subject of an extradition
case, against deprivation of his liberty and his right to defend
himself."
</P>
<P>
"The ruling recognizes the constitutional rights of a Filipino
citizen and grants these rights to individuals facing difficulties
with other countries," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Ople, who chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from
1992 until he ascended to the Senate presidency last year, said
the review of the extradition treaties he called for could be done
simultaneously in Congress and in the Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
He said the Tribunal's decision inferred a flaw in the
Philippine-U.S. extradition treaty which showed a disregard for
the constitutional rights of citizens in its enforcement.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court ruling in effect upheld an earlier decision
by a Manila court which stopped in August 1999 the Department of
Justice from processing the extradition of Jimenez to the United
States.

TOKYO, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo

nations to gather opinions from their assigned countries for the
Group of Eight(G-8) annual summit to be held in Okinawa in July,
Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with the ambassadors, who just concluded an annual
four-day meeting in Tokyo, Obuchi also asked them to convey his
message to leaders of the Asia-Pacific countries that he intends
to "continue to build up personal ties of trust with them," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The ambassadors reaffirmed the importance of having Asia's
opinions reflected in the G-8 summit on July 21-23 in Okinawa.

Some envoys shared the view that in the context of the G-8,
Asian nations are interested in development, poverty and social
safety nets to deal with growing economic globalization, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The ambassadors also expressed the belief that the East Asian
economy is "starting to recover" from the prolonged financial
crisis, and they shared the view that Japan should study free-
trade agreements with other Asian nations and consider setting up
a proposed Asian Monetary Fund with a long-term prospective in
mind.

MADRID, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Spanish political parties and
the public strongly accused terrorist group Basque Homeland and
Freedom (ETA) of two car bombings Friday morning in the capital
city of Madrid.

success.

Madrid for a demonstration against ETA's terrorism Friday
afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Retaliate Poland on Envoys Expulsion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Moscow is to expel a group of
Polish diplomats in retaliation for Warsaw's decision to deport
nine Russian envoys, the Interfax news agency quoted sources in
the Russian intelligence services as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The number will be significant," said the sources, who added
that the expulsion order would come either Friday evening or
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Russia's response "will be tough," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The interfax also quoted the sources as saying that the West
was behind Poland's decision in a bid to "test" acting President
Vladimir Putin. "But it is the Poles who will pay the price."
</P>
<P>
The Polish government Thursday announced its expulsions of
Russian diplomats on spying charges.
</P>
<P>
The Polish Foreign Ministry summoned Russian Ambassador
Thursday and informed him that nine of his country's diplomats
were "persona non grata", because they were detected by Polish
security services engaging in "active espionage operations,"
according to an official statement.
</P>
<P>
Polish officials refused to elaborate what the Russians were
accused of, or to what degree it harmed the interests of the
Polish state.
</P>
<P>
It was unclear whether the spying activities had been directed
at Poland's NATO links, commercial targets, or other areas, and
whether the diplomats would have to leave Poland at once.
</P>
<P>
Challenging the Polish move, the Russian Foreign Ministry said
Thursday that it would respond to the banishment, describing it as
an "unprecedented step" which hurt bilateral ties.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Reception Marks Sino-Vietnamese Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- China highly values its
traditional friendship and relations of all-round cooperation with
Vietnam, and is ready to work jointly with Vietnam to further
promote Sino-Vietnamese friendly relations in the future,Chinese
Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said here today.
</P>
<P>
Tang made the remark at a reception this evening, marking the
50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that China and Vietnam are neighbors linked by
mountains and rivers, and the people of the two countries have a
time-honored friendship. He added that bilateral relations have
withstood the test of decades, and good-neighborliness has
characterized their relationship.
</P>
<P>
He said that leaders of the two countries have kept up a
tradition of exchanges since the normalization of bilateral
relations in 1991, and that this has been invaluable in
maintaining bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Tang referred to the Beijing summit between General Secretary
Jiang Zemin of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee and his Vietnamese counterpart Le Kha Phieu in February
last year. He said that during the meeting, the two leaders set
far-sighted guidelines for the two countries' future relationship,
marked by stability, good-neighborliness and all-round cooperation,
and signifying a new era of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that Premier Zhu Rongji also paid a visit to Vietnam

land border treaty signed at the end of last year contributed to
the further development of bilateral ties, he added.

new generation of leaders of the two countries has developed "
comrade-like and brotherly" Sino-Vietnamese relations, which were

<HEADLINE> China Sticks to Land Use Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- China will stick to its law on
land use in an effort to ensure sustainable economic growth and
social progress, said Jiang Chunyun, vice-chairman of the National
People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee here today.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting marking the first anniversary of the
implementation of the revised Land Use Law, considered as the
strictest in the world, Jiang said that arable land has been put
under special protection and the illegal use of land has been
controlled over the past year since the law was imposed.
</P>
<P>
The law requires that each province, autonomous region and
municipality guarantee that the amount of arable land under their
jurisdiction does not decrease, and that land quality is improved
at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China imposes tight reins on approving land use for
construction. The Land Use Law empowers only the central and
provincial governments with approval rights, and raises
compensation for land acquisition.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that many problems should not be neglected.
The arable land is still decreasing in some areas because of
construction. And the goal to maintain the total amount of
farmland has not been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Jiang emphasized that the implementation of the Land Use Law
and protection of farmland are of great importance to China's
sustainable economic and social development in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He said that an understanding of the Land Use Law should be
widely spread among Chinese citizens and everybody should be aware
of the importance of land protection. Illegal use of land should
be punished according to law, he said.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Urges Boost to Publication Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
has urged that the press and publication sector should be boosted
during the development of the socialist market economy, saying
material and ideological progress are equally important.
</P>
<P>
He described the press and publication departments as the
country's key publicity and ideological organs which should "arm
the people with scientific theories, guide the people in the right
direction, and inspire the people with outstanding works."
</P>
<P>
While reviewing the 1999 work in the field, Li said a group of
publications highlighting Deng Xiaoping Theory and the great
achievements of the country had created a healthy ideological
environment for the people.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that building the market economy did not mean
control of the press and the publication sector should be loosened.
</P>
<P>
He called on the sector to publish more affordable and useful
books for ordinary people, while abandoning the profit-above-all
mentality in order to keep the cultural environment "prosperous
but clean."
</P>
<P>
An annual meeting on the press and publication is ongoing in
Beijing to map out the new year's working plan.

<P>
MANILA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada has ordered his economic team to be more creative in
generating revenues, a senior official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Jose Pardo said in a radio interview that the
president also ordered all line agencies to make sacrifices in the
face of a cut of 22 billion pesos (550-million-dollars) in the
2000 budget.
</P>
<P>
"Why not make the effort attractive enough? It will induce the
buying public to demand receipts, and prompt retailers to pay
sales and excise taxes," Pardo quoted Estrada as saying.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the president wants the public to
participate actively and willingly in the government's revenue
generating efforts.
</P>
<P>
Pardo added that creative efforts would complement the "
realistic"revenue generation projections estimated by his
department for this year.
</P>
<P>
For 2000, the Finance Department has given the Bureau of
Internal Revenue a collection target of 397 billion pesos (9.9

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Fully Open Up Telecom Market in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Singapore will speed up the
liberalization process of its telecommunications market by
introducing full competition from April 1 this year, instead of
initializing the move two years later.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Communications and Information Technology (MCIT)
Yeo Cheow Tong made the announcement at a press conference Friday.
</P>
<P>
He also declared that Singapore will lift the existing direct
and indirect foreign equity limits of 49 percent for all public
telecommunications licenses with immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
The government had committed not to liberalize the
telecommunications market until March 31, 2002 which meant that
full market competition would be introduced only from April 1,
2002.
</P>
<P>
"Our phased liberalization approach has now led key global info-
communications players to perceive us to be less competitive and
attractive," Yeo said.
</P>
<P>
"To maintain Singapore's edge in the info-communications market,
the government must therefore act decisively to lift the two-year
moratorium period, and to accelerate the liberalization of the
telecommunications sector," he declared.
</P>
<P>
He said Singapore cannot afford to maintain the two-year
moratorium period because in the fast-paced info-communications
industry, even a few months can make a substantial difference.
</P>
<P>
The current two and the only two public basic
telecommunications services (PBTS) companies, SingTel and StarHub,
will get compensations for any loss of revenue resulting from the
accelerated liberalization timetable, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government awarded StarHub last year the second PBTS
license on the basis that there would be only two such licenses
till March 11,2002.
</P>
<P>
SingTel, StarHub's rival and the No.1 player in the market,
would have made investment decisions based on the government's
announcements that there will be managed competition during the
two years, Yeo said.
</P>
<P>
He said an international consultant will be engaged to advise
the government on the actual compensation amounts.
</P>
<P>
As for new-comers, he said, the government will not restrict
the number of licenses that may be awarded except where there are
spectrum and other physical constraints, he said.
</P>
<P>
"New entrants will be free to decide on the types of facilities
to build and own, and the types of services to offer,"the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
The government will evaluate license applications based on the
applicant's commitment to developing and investing in Singapore's
info-communications infrastructure, he said.
</P>
<P>
Singapore, aiming to be a leading info-communications hub in
the Asia-Pacific, decided in May 1996 on the present pace of not
fully liberalizing the telecommunications industry until April 1,
2002.

<HEADLINE> HK Banking Sector to Focus on Consultancy Study (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA) announced Friday that it will give priorities to
the study on deposit protection and credit register this year to
produce a set of recommendations to meet the needs of Hong Kong's
banking system.
</P>
<P>
David Carse, HKMA's deputy chief executive, told a press
conference that the work priorities in 2000 of the Hong Kong
banking sector will be given particularly to the implementation of
recommendations of the consultancy study on deposit protection and
credit register.
</P>
<P>
It will review in the first half of this year whether it is
safe to proceed with the first stage of interest rate deregulation
on July 1 and review the three-tie structure later in 2000, Carse
said.
</P>
<P>
The first stage of the study will consist of a report by
external consultants, aiming to appoint the consultants and for
them to start work before the end of March 2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the consultancy study on deposit protection is
to make recommendations on the most appropriate features of a
deposit insurance scheme for Hong Kong and to identify and
evaluate viable alternative means of deposit protection, according
to Carse.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the study is aimed at considering the relative costs
and benefits of deposit insurance and to produce a set of
recommendations on which of the possible options would best meet
the needs of the Hong Kong banking system and its depositors,
Carse explained.
</P>
<P>
"We are also looking for measures to finalize the guideline on
corporate governance, to implement risk-based supervisory approach,
and to develop policy on, and enhance supervision of, e-banking,"
Carse said.

<HEADLINE> HK Banking Sector to Focus on Consultancy Study (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 2000, the HKMA will remain the front-line regulator for
exempt dealers and will devote more resources to supervision of
the examination teams of information and technology specialists,
Carse noted.
</P>
<P>
The HKMA will also focus their efforts on monitoring the
progress on consolidation and banks' asset quality, on reviewing
policies on money laundering, and on enhancing financial
disclosure by banks, he added.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the performance of the Hong Kong banking sector in
1999, Carse said that the HKMA's main tasks of the past year were
preparations for Y2K issues, monitoring of asset quality, and
involvement in corporate workouts.
</P>
<P>
On the balance sheet developments, Carse said, Hong Kong banks
have had plentiful liquidity due to a continuing annual growth
rate of 8.2 percent in deposits and continued decline of 8.7
percent annually in domestic loans.
</P>
<P>
Carse said that as the economic recovery gathers pace, domestic
lending should also revive, believing that the increase in
November is the first sign of this.
</P>
<P>
The excess liquidity has also had a beneficial impact on
funding cost, though it is putting downward pressure on lending
margins, particularly on residential mortgages, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Carse warned that in setting the lending margins on
long-term loans, banks need to beware of the risk that funding
cost may rise.
</P>
<P>
As for profitability of local banks, Carse said that in
aggregate, pre-provision operating profits are expected to have
improved in 1999 due to the growth in average interest-bearing
assets, maintenance of the net interest margin and reduction in
operating expenses.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead to 2000, Carse said that the banks are generally
expecting a recovery in profits, driven by the expected reduction
in bad debt charge in 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Senate Thursday raised
a seven- man committee to investigate the role played by the Oodua
Peoples Congress (OPC) in Lagos' recent ethnic violence.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper Friday reported that
the panel comprising a member from each of the country's seven
geo-political zones was expected to submit its findings in a
fortnight.
</P>
<P>
The OPC is a radical ethnic group of the Yorubas, one of the
Nigeria's three largest nationalities.
</P>
<P>
The senators opened debate on the Lagos security situation last
 Wednesday basing on President Olusegun Obasanjo's letter to the
National Assembly. In the letter, Obasanjo called their attention
to his message to Bola Tinubu, governor of Nigeria's Lagos State.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, the president was angry with Tinubu's inability
to curb the surging violence in Lagos, Nigeria's economic hub,
and threatened to impose a state of emergency in the state.
</P>
<P>
Some House representatives last Sunday had asked the federal
government to ban the radical ethnic groups including Oodua
Peoples Congress (OPC) and Arewa Peoples Congress (APC), which
were believed to be behind the conflicts between the Yorubas,
Hausas and Ijaws, other two ethnic groups in the country in Lagos
recently, which had killed hundreds of people in recent months.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Chief Prosecutor Urges Arrest of Opposition Party Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar's Attorney
General has said he would not prosecute 18 opposition Civic United
Front (CUF) members on treason charges until two CUF leaders are
arrested and indicted.
</P>
<P>
"Without the arrest of the pair...there is no case," the
71-year- old Attorney General of Zanzibar Ali Mohamed Omar was
quoted as saying by the Guardian newspaper on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the Zanzibar government for refusing to grant police
permission to enforce the arrest warrant for the Secretary General
of CUF Seif Shariff Hamad and Vice-Chairman Shaaban Mloo issued by
his office 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the reason his office had to seek permission from
the government for the arrest of the two CUF leaders, Omar said it
is a political trial, not an ordinary case.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that all available evidence incriminated Hamad and
Mloo as having allegedly masterminded, plotted and led secret
meetings for the overthrow of the Zanzibar government.
</P>
<P>
The 18 CUF members denied they had plotted a coup against the
Zanzibar government when they appeared in court for the first time
after two years of detention.

<P>
KAMPALA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The 16 Ugandans released by
rebels Wednesday are undergoing treatment in Khartoum and will
come back home in a couple of days, a senior Ugandan official said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with Xinhua, State Minister for
Regional Cooperation Amama Mbabazi said: "They are still being
treated in a hospital in Khartoum, but they are coming back very

</P>
<P>
Reports here said that this was in response to Uganda's release

<P>
The Ugandans were abducted by the Khartoum-backed Ugandan rebel
group, Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), which has been operating in
northern Uganda from bases in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Stone Implements Found in Skeleton of Whale in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Debris of stone implements of
ancient human being have been found beside and in a whale skeleton
discovered by the archaeologists operating in central Angola,
experts said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in the world that a skeleton of sea mammal
was found with lithic materials, including shells, beside and in
its interior, according to an expert of the French-Angolan
archaeologic mission which is now operating in the central coast
province of Benguela.
</P>
<P>
Manuel Gutierrez, head of the mission, said the discovery is
even more important because the scientists have found in the
skeleton evidence proving that the sea animals have been serving
our ancestors as food for a long time.
</P>
<P>
"It is the first time in the history that the archaeologists
found the remains of whale with characteristics proving that they
were food of our ancestors," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Gutierrez, the archaeologic pit located in the
region of Baia Farta in the southern part of Benguela could be a
"center of attraction" for the archaeologists from all around the
world and others interested in the life of the ancestors.
</P>
<P>
The 5.64-meter-long bones will be sent to the National Museum
of Archaeology in the provincial capital city of Benguela, where
they will be kept under the same anatomical condition.
</P>
<P>
Paleontologist Claude Guerin estimated that the whale, the
species of which is not yet identified, is some 20 meter long and
weighs 50 tons. The age of the skeleton is estimated at 300,000 to
one million years.
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez and Guerin, experts respectively from the
universities of Paris-1 and Lyon, qualified the discovery as the
first of its kind registered in the history of archaeologic
research in all the world.
</P>
<P>
The lithic pieces found in the region of Baia Farta also
indicate that there were human beings living in the region over
two million years ago, they said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Calls for Help on Poverty Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa has called on international community to help the
indebted poor African countries implement poverty reduction and
growth strategy.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal in Libreville, Gabon, at an African summit
on economic growth and poverty reduction in Sub-Saharan Africa,
according to a copy of his speech published Friday by local
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said that financing of the Highly Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) program aimed at reducing the burden of debt should come
from proposed additional financial resources, not re-allocated
resources.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said the decline of Africa's share of the world trade
will only exacerbate poverty on the continent.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Trade Organization (WTO) statistics,
from 1990 to1996, African exports of goods grew by only 2 percent
on average compared with a world average of 7 percent and 10
percent for Asia.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa stressed that sustainable development should be
self-development, both for individuals as well as for states.
</P>
<P>
"We need to sensitize our people for self-development within a
conducive environment created by the government with the practical
support of donors," he added.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Cut Tariff on Raw material Import </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government is to
make more import duty concessions on raw materials to boost
capacity utilization, raise competitiveness and create employment
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The government intended to concede some 19 billion naira (about
1. 9 billion U.S. dollars) in customs duties and other charges,
the Guardian newspaper Friday quoted Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo as saying at a joint sitting of the National Assembly in
Abuja on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the duty on imported finished goods will be
increased to protect local industries, except that on fertilizer,
which will enjoy significant subsidy to enhance accessibility to
farmers, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Obasanjo, the country is also to embrace the
policy of return of excise duty on alcoholic beverages and
bleaching creams.
</P>
<P>
The re-introduction of the duty abolished over six years ago is
aimed to " safeguard the health of our citizens and offset part of
the financial burden on public health budget," he said.

<HEADLINE> Japan Donates to China's Crested Ibis Protection Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Grassroots Ground Aid
will donate 73,831 U.S. dollars to a center raising crested ibis
in Yangxian County in northwest China's Shaanxi Province,
according to an agreement signed between the two sides at the
Japanese embassy today.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to build 300 square meters of breeding
rooms for the birds and a publicity and education hall at the
center, according to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The crested ibis is an extremely endangered species, said an
expert in this field, adding that there are only about 200 of them
left, mostly in China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Yangxian County and its nearby areas are home to a large
proportion of the crested ibis family, said Wang Shousen, vice-
governor of the Shaanxi provincial government.
</P>
<P>
There are over 90 wild crested ibises in the province and 75
raised at the center, according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
China and Japan have been cooperating to protect the crested
ibis in recent years, and China presented a pair of the birds to
Japan during Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to Japan in
1998. The couple produced offspring last May, which aroused great
interest in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Nobuyuki Sugimoto, minister of the Japanese embassy in Beijing,
expressed the hope that the implementation of the program will
become a new opportunity for the Chinese and Japanese peoples to
strengthen their friendship.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Grassroots Ground Aid, which has been cooperating with
China for more than ten years, grants free aid and support for
selected programs in the fields of culture, education, and health
protection to underdeveloped countries and regions.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Red Cross Society of China
(RCSC) received 103 million yuan (12.4 million U.S. dollars) in
overseas donations in 1999 to benefit more than two million
disaster victims, according to a RCSC official.
</P>
<P>
The funds donated by foreign countries, as well as Hong Kong
and Taiwan, were spent on disaster-relief goods such as rice,
medicines, winter clothing and quilts, Wang Lizhong, vice
president of the RCSC, told the press today.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Civil Affairs showed that 2,966
people were killed and 353 million people affected last year by
natural disasters ranging from floods, earthquakes, wind storms,
and drought to hailstorms.
</P>
<P>
Economic losses caused by the disasters totaled 196.2 billion
yuan. More than 100,000 people lost their homes in earthquakes in
Shanxi and Liaoning provinces.
</P>
<P>
Wang Lizhong said the RCSC had published bank account numbers
for donations and donation hotlines, reported disaster conditions
to the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent
Societies, and submitted claims for international aid through the
United Nations.

BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Boundary demarcation is vital
to China's social stability, economic growth and national unity,
State Councilor Ismail Amat said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a working conference sponsored by the National Boundary
Demarcation Office, which opened here this morning, Ismail Amat
emphasized that boundary demarcation work should be strengthened
to maintain stability in the border areas.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, 84.7 percent of the 60,000 kilometers
of provincial borders and 94.5 percent of the 410,000-kilometer
boundaries between counties had been demarcated.
</P>
<P>
However, many boundary disputes still exist in China. A clear
demarcation of all provincial and county-level administrative
boundaries should be on top of working agenda this year, said Amat.

<HEADLINE> Turkish MPs to Be Banned From Wearing Headscarves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Turkish parliament's
Constitutional Affairs Committee adopted Thursday a motion to ban
legislators from wearing headscarves in the parliament, reported
Turkish Daily News on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The motion will be submitted to the parliament for approval.
</P>
<P>
Eleven members of the committee, all of them representing the
three ruling parties, presented the motion in Thursday's committee
meeting on adding sections to the parliament's bylaws pertaining to
the dress codes of the Grand National Assembly (parliament).
</P>
<P>
In the ensuing voting in the committee, the motion was adopted
by a narrow margin of 11 to 10. Three committee members were
absent.
</P>
<P>
Under the motion, a new paragraph will be added into the
parliament bylaws, explicitly stating that "Deputies shall take
part in Parliament's work with their heads uncovered."
</P>
<P>
If the parliament upholds the draft without making any
modifications, said the paper, deputies will no longer be able to
take part in parliament activities wearing headscarves.
</P>
<P>
A so-called headscarf crisis occurred on May 2, 1999. When the
new parliament, elected in April, convened for the first time, an
attempt by opposition Virtue Party's (FP) Istanbul Deputy, Merve
Kavakci, to take the oath wearing her headscarf was blocked by the
Democratic Left Party (DSP), the coalition government's senior
partner.
</P>
<P>
"This is not the place to challenge the state," DSP Chairman and
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said.
</P>
<P>
People wearing headscarves, a traditional Islamic costume, were
forbidden from entering public institutions in Turkey, a mostly
Muslim-populated but strictly secular country.
</P>
<P>
Later, the Council of Ministers (cabinet) decided to strip
Kavakci of her Turkish nationality on the grounds that she had
acquired United States citizenship without obtaining permission
from the Turkish authorities in advance.
</P>
<P>
An uproar erupted in the parliament and heated debates lasted
until the parliament's recess on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Chief Prosecutor Vural Savas
vehemently attacked the opposition Islamic Virtue Party and called
for its closure in his verbal presentations at the Constitutional
Court Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the Virtue Party is more involved in "fundamentalist
activities" than the banned Welfare Party (RP).
</P>
<P>
The Islamic RP was banned in January, 1998, on charges of anti-
secular activities and its leader, former Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan, was barred from politics for five years.
</P>
<P>
Savas, who successfully pushed through the case against the RP,
argued the FP has become a hub of anti-secular activities and is
still controlled by Erbakan. The FP was reported to be born out of
the dissolved RP two years ago.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus-Israel Arms Deal Reportedly on the Cards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli Defense Ministry
delegation visiting Cyprus this week has prepared the ground for a
significant arms purchase deal by the Cyprus government, local
newspapers reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The delegation had contacts with the Defense Committee of
Cyprus' House of Representatives (parliament), which were later
described as "interesting, friendly and truthful."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' Defense Ministry only confirmed that the delegation,
which arrived here on January 16 for a four-day stay, was here for
a series of contacts to strengthen and develop relations between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Secrecy surrounding the visit - not even the names of the
Israeli delegation were officially released - has led to wide media
speculation that a military agreement is on the cards.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said the delegation had assured Greek Cypriot
legislators that Tel-Aviv would sell Nicosia weapons systems
developed with Israeli know-how.
</P>
<P>
In the past it has been Israel's policy not to sell weapons to
Cyprus. Israel's regional ally Turkey is occupying the northern
third of the island and backs a breakaway Turkish Cypriot regime in
northern Cyprus, which is not recognized by other countries.
</P>
<P>
The delegation also told Cypriot parliamentarians that there
would not be a repeat of last year's violations of Cypriot airspace
by Israeli fighter jets during joint exercises with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' Defense Minister Socrates Hasikos is expected to visit
Tel-Aviv soon where he will have discussions on a military
cooperation deal with Israel, local newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' Defense Ministry and the Israeli embassy in Nicosia have
reportedly been working on such an agreement for months.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Tumble on Singapore Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Share prices tumbled on
Singapore Stock Market Friday following a one-day strong technical
rebound on Thursday as the weaker overnight close of the Dow Jones
Industrial Average dampened the market sentiment.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) fell 37.05 points to a
finish of 2,278.48 points, up from the intra-day low of 2,260.79
points.
</P>
<P>
Total volume rose to 446.28 million shares valued at 816.18
million Singapore dollars (487.33 million U.S. dollars). Losers
outnumbered gainers by 270 to 53 with 188 counters unchanged.
</P>
<P>
KianAnn was the most active stock which registered a turnover
of 48.16 million units. Kingboard was the second most heavily
traded stock which had 34.54 million shares done. Eastgate was the
next with 32.31 million counters changing hands.
</P>
<P>
Datacrft led gainers of the day, rising by 75 cents to close at
8.8 U.S. dollars. PacCent picked up 60 cents to finish at 17.9
Singapore dollars. OCBC edged up 20 cents to end at 14.2 Singapore
dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the slippery slope, SPH was the biggest loser, incurring a
loss of 130 cents to close at 32.3 Singapore dollars. Venture sank
90 cents to finish at 22.3 Singapore dollars. DBS fell 80 cents to
end at 21.9 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers attributed Friday's slump to a funds shift to other
markets as investors have done for some time.
</P>
<P>
They said Thursday's technical rebound, which came after four
straight sessions of losses, proved to be temporary.
</P>
<P>
They said the low volume this week also suggested that the
funds had not been active although there was some interest in
small capital issues.
</P>
<P>
Brokers pointed out that this was because investors always took
cues from Wall Street for market direction.

<HEADLINE> Children Traffickers Sentenced in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Fourteen offenders have been
sentenced to prison terms of between 20 years and 13 months for
their involvement in the biggest-ever children trafficking case by
the Provincial People's Court in Vietnam's southern province of An
Giang, Vietnam News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The children trafficking lasted from 1995 to the end of 1997 at
the center for caring the elderly and orphans under An Giang's Red
Cross Chapter, involving 14 offenders.
</P>
<P>
Bui Van Khanh, former chief of the Civil Status Registration
Office under the An Giang Provincial Justice Department, and
Nguyen Kim Thanh, former deputy director of the Obstetrics
Department of the An Giang Provincial Polyclinics, will be jailed
for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Pham Thanh Hai, former director of the center for caring the
elderly and orphans under An Giang's Red Cross Chapter, was
sentenced to eight years in jail.
</P>
<P>
All these three convicts were charged with trafficking in
children and accepting bribes.
</P>
<P>
According to the court indictment, Hai and his deputy Pham Van
Do handled 194 cases of child adoption by foreigners under a
government decree issued on November 30, 1994.
</P>
<P>
But only nine of these cases were legal as foreign parents made
direct contacts with the center to ask for permission to adopt 12
children.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 185 cases, which involved 199 children, were made
through a group of mediators.

<HEADLINE> Indian Govt Resumes Talks With Port Strikers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Talks resumed here Friday
between the Indian government and the five key trade unions
representing more than 100,000 port and dock workers on strike
across the country.
</P>
<P>
The strike, triggered by the government's rejection of the port
workers' demand for higher wages and better service conditions,
started at midnight Monday and has since seriously crippled India'
s all 11 major ports.
</P>
<P>
The port workers' federations returned to the negotiating table
after they received a government invitation for talks on Thursday,
the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
Shanti Patel, president of the All India Port &AMP; Dock Workers'
Federation, said the trade unions insist that the periodicity of
wage revision for the port workers should be retained at five
years instead of 10 years as proposed by the government.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government deployed the navy, territorial army and
coast guards to help the strike-hit ports handle cargo shipments.
Official sources said the operational efficiency had gradually
increased to 74 percent on Thursday from a mere 40 percent on
Tuesday, the first day of the strike.
</P>
<P>
However, a port management official estimated the economic
losses for the strike-hit ports at some half a million U.S.
dollars a day.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Promises to Compensate Firms' Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- A COMESA official has assured
its firms that the Common Market for the Eastern and Southern
Africa (COMESA) will compensate their losses if occurred when the
COMESA Free Trade Area (FTA) takes effect later this year.
</P>
<P>
The Post newspaper on Friday quoted COMESA Secretary General
Erastus Mwencha as saying it is unnecessary for people to
continually complain over the FTA when all aspects have already
been examined and protection granted on the regional and national
levels with a provision for compensation in the event of any
commercial loss.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA chief said he does not understand the continued
outcry from Zambia Association of Manufacturers (ZAM) that Zambia
will not benefit from the FTA.
</P>
<P>
All COMESA members are required to have zero tariffs by the end
of October this year to enable free movement of goods and services
within the region.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha challenged ZAM and others worried about FTA to produce
statistics to prove the non-profitability of FTA.
</P>
<P>
ZAM has warned that FTA will entail severe tax losses for
Zambia and further lead to job losses.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha however said: "Zambia is one of the chief exporters in
the region, I do not see how the free trade area would affect
business."

<HEADLINE> Switzerland Tops European Forest Scorecards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland takes the best care
of its forests in Europe, announced the World Wide Fund for Nature
(WWF) in a press release received here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Top-ranked Switzerland scores 62 out of a possible 100 points,
and Finland 61. Sweden, Austria and Slovakia are joint third,
according to WWF's European Forest Scorecards rankings of 20
countries.
</P>
<P>
WWF noted that wealth and supposed environmental awareness is
no guarantee of good forest care - Germany and France have similar
scores to those achieved by eastern neighbor Poland and
Mediterranean countries like Spain and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, WWF warned that all European countries must
take much better care of their forests.
</P>
<P>
"European countries are neglecting their forests," said Per
Rosenberg, Head of WWF's European Forest Program. "Even the
highest scoring country, Switzerland, only achieves 62 out of 100.
The average score is 51. This is far too low. All countries have
serious improvements to make in many areas of forest care."
</P>
<P>
Among the problems that need tackling in many countries are:
pollution, lack of semi-natural or undisturbed forests,
insufficient amount of protected forests, amount of pesticides and
herbicides being used on forests, and failure to leave dead wood
in the forest, a vital habitat for many animals and plants.
</P>
<P>
WWF European Forest Scorecards are based on international and
regional agreements signed by European nations. They are made up
of 99 separate elements covering a wide range of issues including
timber and other production, environmental care and quality,
social and cultural aspects of forest care, protected areas and
pollution. WWF European Forest Scorecards are unique in providing
comparable information on how Europe treats its forests.
</P>
<P>
"Forests are a unique and precious natural resource," commented
Per Rosenberg. "If cared for wisely, forests will offer jobs,
recreation, timber, water and natural heritage for the millennium
ahead. But Europe is not caring for its forests wisely. Action is
needed now."

<HEADLINE> Century-Old Beijing Hospital Famous in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Tongren Hospital,
founded in 1886, has earned its deserved fame, and the name "
Tongren" was recently officially recognized as a famous Chinese
trademark by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (
SAIC).
</P>
<P>
The historic records of the hospital revealed that the hospital
was founded in 1886 by an American church, Methodist Christ church,
which was headquartered in New York at that time.
</P>
<P>
Since its establishment, the hospital has specialized in
ophthalmology and the treatment of ear, nose and throat diseases,
becoming a recognized authority in these fields. The name "
Tongren" attracts tens of thousands of people from all over the
country every year.
</P>
<P>
Because of its fame, many phony medical companies have
attempted to use the name "Tongren," and incompetent doctors sold
themselves as "experts at the Beijing Tongren Hospital."
</P>
<P>
To fight against this, the prestigious hospital registered its
"Tongren" name with the SAIC in 1997, while making every effort to
expand its popularity among people.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the hospital say that recognition by the SAIC
offers Tongren a good opportunity to develop a thriving practice
made up of medical services, pharmacies, and other sectors.
</P>
<P>
Since 1989, the SAIC has registered dozens of famous trademarks,
mostly for commodities, and Beijing Tongren Hospital is the first
hospital to be granted the famous trademark in China.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Destroys Illegal Fireworks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Beijing today destroyed 200,000
yuan-worth of fireworks as it continues to enforce the ban on
firecrackers in the city during the traditional Spring Festival
which begins on February 5.
</P>
<P>
Since December 1993, when Beijing introduced the ban, fewer
people have been injured by firecrackers, which have been a
traditional Chinese way of celebrating festivals for centuries,
and there have been far fewer fires, according to a local
environment official.
</P>
<P>
But over the past two years, cases of illegally setting off
firecrackers in the city have increased, the official said.
</P>
<P>
This has caused a series of injuries, noise and air pollution,
and several fires resulting in heavy financial losses.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from local hospitals show that they received an
average of 215 patients injured by firecrackers last year, 17 more
than in 1998.
</P>
<P>
During the same year, the city's fire brigades received 278
reports of fires, 3.7 times that of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
However, many people are resentful of the ban because they
insist that firecrackers add to the enjoyment at festival time,
and have called on the municipal government to loosen their ruling.
Several other major cities across China have resumed the fireworks
custom after years of prohibition.
</P>
<P>
But Beijing's local authorities and legislature have reiterated
their firm stance against allowing the setting off of firecrackers
in the city.

<HEADLINE> HK Stocks Further Decline on Rate Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong stocks further
declined on Friday as worries over a U.S. interest rate hike and
falls in the U.S. market unnerved investors.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Hang Seng index lost 106.90 points, or 0.70
percent, to close at 15,108.41. Turnover was 15.116 billion HK
dollars (1.938 billion U.S. dollars), compared with Thursday's 16.
590 billion HK dollars (2.127 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Within the first six minutes of trade, the index fell 311.61
point or 2.05 percent to 14,903.70, the first time the index has
dipped below 15,000 points since November 25.
</P>
<P>
The sectoral sub-indexes of Finance, Utilities Properties and
Commerce &AMP; Industry all lost ground, dropping 1.26 percent, 0.46
percent, 0.18 percent and 0.58 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index went up 0.63
percent and Hang Seng China-Affiliated Corporations Index up 2.66
percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the market seems to be a little fragile now, and
the factors that drive Hang Seng index down are Wall street and
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Open Market Committee is expected to raise
rates by 25 basis points at its February 1-2 meeting, in what is
tipped to be just the first of several rate rises this year.

<HEADLINE> HK Releases Consumer Price Indices for December 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's consumer prices
in overall terms registered a year-on-year rate of decrease of 4
percent in December 1999, smaller than the decline of 4.2 percent
in November, a government statistics department said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department on Friday released
Hong Kong's Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures for December 1999.
</P>
<P>
The smaller year-on-year decline in the Composite CPI was due
to a moderated year-on-year decrease in the CPI(C), from 4.5
percent in November to 4.1 percent in December. This was largely
brought about by a smaller decrease in the prices of outerclothing,
particularly items at higher end, the statistics show.
</P>
<P>
As to the CPI(A) and CPI(B), the respective year-on-year
decreases were 2.9 percent and 4.9 percent in December 1999, same
as in November 1999.
</P>
<P>
The average monthly rate of change in the seasonally adjusted
Composite CPI during the 3-month period ended December 1999 was -0.
2 percent, slightly larger than the corresponding change of -0.1
percent recorded during the 3-month period ended November 1999.
</P>
<P>
As for the three sub-indices, the average monthly rates of
change in the seasonally adjusted CPI(A), CPI(B) and CPI(C) during
the 3-month period ended December 1999 were virtually nil, -0.2
percent and -0.4 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
A Government Secretariat spokesman noted that even with the
recent pick-up in consumer spending, prices for a wide range of
goods and services were still on a decline, reflecting continued
price discounts by the retailers concerned amidst keen competition
in the retail market.
</P>
<P>
For 1999 as a whole, the Composite CPI was down by 4.0 percent,
representing a distinct easing from the 2.8 percent rise in 1998,
the spokesman said, adding that this was in line with the downward
adjustment in costs and prices in the local economy over the past
year.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Urges to Use Oil Revenues on Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami has urged government officials to spend oil incomes as
investment on development programs rather than as expenditures on
daily life.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to local officials of the southern Hormozgan province
in an inspection tour Thursday night, Khatami said officials should
seek other sources to ensure the country's budget of current
expenditures, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said that his government had faced serious problems in
guaranteeing the budget of development programs in the 1998 fiscal
year since the country lost 5.2 billion U.S. dollars in oil
revenues due to the sharp oil price falls that year.
</P>
<P>
Iran is the second largest oil producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), with a daily yield of about
3.6 million barrels. Oil incomes provide over 80 percent of the
country's badly-needed foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Due to the severe oil price plunge in 1998 and early 1999, Iran
earned less than 10 billion dollars in the 1998 fiscal year which
ended on March 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
But experts expected that Iran can earn some 3 billion dollars
more than the 10.6 billion initially budgeted for the 1999 fiscal
year. Oil prices picked up on the world market following concerted
production cuts by OPEC members and non-OPEC oil producers since
1999.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said that his government will make efforts to solve the
country's economic problems, including bring down inflation.
</P>
<P>
In additional to its attention to the daily problems, the
government will also take fundamental steps to solve the general
problems in the third five-year development plan (2000-2005), he
said, without giving details.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin called on President
Ezer Weizman to take a vacation on Thursday, after police upgraded
their probe of his gift-taking to a full-scale criminal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Weizman's lawyer and a top aide both insisted he is innocent and
has no planes to step down.
</P>
<P>
Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein ordered the police and tax
authorities to launch the investigation into suspected business
links between Weizman and French millionaire Edouard Saroussi in
1983 and 1984. Rubinstein noted that these ties continued after
Weizman became a cabinet minister.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Yoav Yitzhak, the investigative journalist who broke the
original story about cash payments mad to Weizman by a French
businessman, revealed another scandal about Weizman on Thursday
that 3.5 million U.S. dollars had bee paid to Weizman's business
partner Rami Unger in 1984.
</P>
<P>
The money was allegedly paid in return for a pledge by Weizman -
made in the form of a note he signed in a restaurant - not to join
a national unity government headed by the Likud and thus to enable
Labor's Shimon Peres to become prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States reassured Palestinian Authority Chairman
Yasser Arafat on Thursday that it is still committed to helping
secure peace between Israel and the Palestinians and that it would
not allow the Syrian track to divert its attention from the final-
status negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- In a Yediot Aharonot poll, 39 percent of the Israeli public
said Weizman could remain in the office, while 41 percent of them
believed he should resign or take a vacation.
</P>
<P>
In another poll, 42 of 120 Knesset (parliament) members said
Weizman should step down or take a vacation.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Clashes Kill 16 Rebels in Northern Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government troops
killed 16 Tamil rebels in fresh clashes in the north of country
Thursday, the Defense Ministry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the rebels' casualties were reported from the
northernmost Jaffna peninsula, said R.P. Witana, military
spokesman for the ministry.
</P>
<P>
He said 13 rebels were killed in six separate clashes on
Thursday in different parts of the peninsula, the former
stronghold of the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (
LTTE) until 1996.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE, which is fighting for independence for minority
Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983, has intensified
their offensives in a bid to capture the Elephant Pass, a causeway
linking the peninsula with the rest of the island country.
</P>
<P>
The capture of the causeway is the first step of the LTTE's
attempt to regain control of the peninsula. But there appeared to
have been a stalemate due to the stiff resistance of government
troops.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said two LTTE rebels were killed in the northern
Welioya area when troops destroyed a rebels' bunker line with
rocket-propelled grenades.
</P>
<P>
He added that troops on an ambush killed one more rebel with
small arms in the northern Vavuniya region.

In addition to the Shopping Guide, the CEBP is sub-divided into

<HEADLINE> CAS to Attract Young Scientists to Western China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS) will increase the annual funding for the "Light of West
China" program, which is aimed at cultivating leading researchers
and scientists in western China, from three million yuan to five
million yuan (about 60 million U.S. dollars), said CAS vice
president Chen Yiyu here today.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the program is expected to attract more young
scientists to work in the western region.
</P>
<P>
CAS began the "Light of West China" project in 1996 to
encourage leading scholars and scientists to go west. The project,
covering seven provinces and autonomous regions including Gansu,
Qinghai, Xinjiang, Yunnan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, and Sichuan, has
helped economic and social development in these areas.
</P>
<P>
The program, which received 11.8 million yuan from the CAS and
three million yuan from local governments, and sponsored 40 young
people to pursue doctoral degrees, has been most successful.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the CAS will support young scientists at CAS
branches in central and eastern China to work two to three years
in western China, in a bid to stimulate exchange and cooperation
among young scientists.

<HEADLINE> 29 Major Chinese Cities Report Good Air This Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The quality of air in 29 major
Chinese cities was good this week, while that in some northern
cities was poor, the China Environmental Monitoring Center said
today.
</P>
<P>
In their weekly report issued today, the center said weak winds
in north China during the first half of the week were responsible
for the increased concentration of pollutants in the air, causing
serious air pollution.
</P>
<P>
Despite stronger winds later in the week that helped disperse
some of the pollutants, the air in most major cities in north
China was slightly worse than last week.
</P>
<P>
From January 14 to 21, the cities of Guilin, Wenzhou, Nantong,
Zhanjiang, Haikou, and Fuzhou reported excellent air, while Zhuhai,
Wuhan, Zhengzhou, Chengdu, Qingdao, Shanghai, and 16 other cities
in south China reported fairly good air.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin, Guangzhou, Changchun, Chongqing, and nine other cities
reported slightly polluted air.
</P>
<P>
Beijing and Shijiazhuang in north China, and Urumqi in
northwest China, reported unhealthy air, while Hohhot in north
China reported hazardous air.
</P>
<P>
Hohhot, Beijing, Shijiazhuang, Urumqi, and 24 other cities
listed suspended particles as the major pollutant.
</P>
<P>
Nitrogen oxide was the major pollutant in Shanghai, Guangzhou,
Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Wuhan, while Chongqing, Jinan, Guiyang,
Changsha, Yantai, and Qingdao reported sulfur dioxide as the main
culprit.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Considers Tax Cut to Woo Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is likely to
lower taxes to boost industrial production and foreign investment
in the country, the African newspaper reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted a senior official at the Treasury Ministry as saying
that the decision to lower taxes was reached at a joint meeting
among the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industries and
Commerce and Tanzania Revenue Authority this month.
</P>
<P>
But, this is still at the final stage of consideration by
various government organs before the new tax regime is announced,
said the official.
</P>
<P>
The drive towards harmonization of the tax regime in the
country was initiated jointly by the Confederation of Tanzania
Industries (CTI) and the Tanzania Investment Center (TIC) which
presented a list of proposals to the government pointing on
specific taxation not conductive to investors.
</P>
<P>
The proposals included the removal of Value Added Tax on
capital goods, strategies to curb tax evasion and trade mark
infringement.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Chief Expects Budget Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Sydney Olympic organizing
committee (SOCOG) chief executive Sandy Hollway on Friday expected
more budget cuts for the cash-strapped Sydney Olympic Games
despite a likely 50 million dollar (32.5 million US) rescue
package.
</P>
<P>
A deal between the International Olympic Committee, the
Australian Olympic Committee and the New South Wales government to
provide 50 million dollars is being negotiated.
</P>
<P>
But Hollway said even that offer, along with a 50 million
dollar contingency, would not be enough to solve the Game's budget
problems. SOCOG has now fallen 100 million dollars behind in
sponsorship projections.
</P>
<P>
"I think there would have to be a third element which is
savings, finding savings as well," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that any arrangements between the AOC, the IOC
and the government, or any draw on the provision we make on the
contingency, ought to be a substitute for us continuing to pare
down on costs and spending."
</P>
<P>
Hollway said personnel savings could be made with a slower
growth rate of staff, a lower level of paid employees at Games
time, and a more rapid drop-off of numbers after the Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Achieves Results in Anti-Poaching Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Police in southwest China's
Yunnan Province have achieved initial results since beginning
their campaign aimed at protecting wild animal resources.
</P>
<P>
Police already have uncovered 1,325 cases of poaching, arrested
261 suspects, rescued 2,799 wild animals, and seized 6,400 kg of
animal-related products and 1,000 furs.
</P>
<P>
The "No. 2 Southern Operation" was jointly launched by the
provinces of Guangdong, Fujian and Yunnan, and the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, areas known for their lush vegetation and
abundant wildlife.
</P>
<P>
The 10-day anti-poaching campaign in southern China is aimed at
cracking down on the thriving illegal trade in endangered species.
</P>
<P>
Beginning last Saturday, police, in cooperation with customs,
railway, and civil aviation departments, inspected railway and bus
stations, airports, border ports, markets, hotels and restaurants
searching for protected wild animals. Fifteen restaurants
allegedly featuring exotic cuisine also have been punished.
</P>
<P>
This campaign follows the first, which focused on preventing
the poaching of the endangered Tibetan antelope in the Hoh Xil
Nature Reserve in far western China, an area spanning parts of
Qinghai Province, and the Xinjiang Ugyur and Tibet autonomous
regions.
</P>
<P>
China closed this nature reserve on January 1 to protect this
endangered species prized for its fine fur used to make shawls.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan, known as the "kingdom of animals and plants," has 40
percent of China's wild animals species, and is one of the world's
richest areas of diversified animal and plant life.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Drive Against Consumption of Wildlife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The China Wildlife
Conservation Association (CWCA) initiated a campaign Thursday,
calling for the elimination of the "bad habit" of putting wild
animals on the dinner table to boost the on-going crackdown on
illegal poaching and trade of wild animals.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent nationwide survey conducted by the CWCA,
80 percent of the wild animals that are illegal hunted and traded
end up as dinner, and nearly half of the 23,000 people questioned
said had, on at least one occasion, eaten wild animal dishes.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which involved 21 major cities across China from
September to December 1999, found that wild animals were traded in
91 of the 218 markets surveyed, and consumed in 688 of the 1,381
restaurants surveyed.
</P>
<P>
Among the 53 species of wild animals that were illegally traded
and consumed, 14 are on China's protected species list, and most
of them are hunted in the wild.
</P>
<P>
The survey also indicates that the popularity consuming wild
animals in China is mostly based on the belief that these animals
are more nutritious than domestic ones, and therefore good for
health.
</P>
<P>
But experts have a different view. A report by the Chinese
Academy of Sciences, the Northeast University of Forestry based in
Jilin Province, and other research institutions, said that
diseases suffered by animals and the toxic elements in their
bodies can easily affect the people who eat them, sometimes with
fatal consequences.
</P>
<P>
What's more, many wild animals are poisoned to death by
poachers, and the poisons can remain in their bodies for a long
period of time, so it is extremely hazardous to consume such
animals, the report says.
</P>
<P>
CWCA Secretary-General Wang Fuxing said that his association
will carry out the campaign for a long time, and will hold various
activities this year to help change this "bad eating habit."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The China Insurance Regulatory
Commission (CIRC), the watchdog of China's insurance industry, is
seeking ways to boost international cooperation in order to
establish a legal system for the industry.
</P>
<P>
According to CIRC officials, China's insurance industry has
been developing rapidly since it resumed operation in the early
1980s, with a growing number of Chinese buying insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Chinese insurers are taking steps to provide
diversified services to meet the growing market demand.
</P>
<P>
The CIRC held an international symposium on insurance industry
supervision in Beijing recently, along with the Organization of
Economic Cooperation and Development. The participating experts
and officials from the two groups had extensive discussions on
supervision systems and the challenges facing China's insurance
industry.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Chinese insurance companies gained approval from the
central bank to purchase construction bonds issued by major
Chinese enterprises, and were granted indirect access to China's
capital market, both of which are helpful for the further
development of Chinese insurers.

<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- A Red Cross program aimed at
providing food to disaster-stricken people in the run-up to China'

</P>
<P>
Peng Peiyun, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress and president of the Red Cross Society

<P>
Four groups from the RCSC will be sent to disaster-stricken
areas in Qinghai, Shaanxi, Hebei, Shanxi, Zhejiang, Inner Mongolia,
Xinjiang and Tibet, along with truckloads of meat and edible oil
and flour.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, more than 20 provinces and autonomous
regions were struck by natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
To help people in these areas enjoy a happy Spring Festival
season, the RCSC initiated the program and called on its
subordinates across the country for support.
</P>
<P>
The RCSC also allocated 1.5 million yuan ( 181,000 U.S.
dollars) to buy meat, edible oil and flour to be sent to the
disaster-hit masses.
</P>
<P>
Peng expressed the hope that people in these areas will be
able to have a happy Spring Festival with help from the government
and various disaster relief organizations.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, RSCS Vice President Sun Aiming went to Yuhang and
Yongjia in East China's Zhejiang Province and delivered the
donated foods to the poor and weak there.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Grants Kenya $7 Million in Fight Against AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States has given
Kenya seven million U.S. dollars to boost its initiative in the
war against HIV/AIDS, according to a media report here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Visiting U.S. Director of the National AIDS Policy Sandra
Thurman disclosed this when she paid a call on Public Health
Minister Sam Ongeri here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Thurman said last year the U.S. government donated 100 million
dollars to Africa, Asia and other regions of the world in the
fight against HIV/ AIDS, adding that the U.S. commits 3.2 million
dollars to Kenya annually through non-governmental organizations
to control the spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Ongeri said the money granted by the U.S. government would help
fund the Kenya AIDS Control Program.
</P>
<P>
He said over 50 percent of hospital beds are occupied by
victims of the disease while the number of orphaned children as a
result of AIDS grows at an alarming rate in the country.
</P>
<P>
Ongeri also appealed to the U.S. government to support the
implementation of Kenya Poverty Eradication Strategy currently
being negotiated with the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund, which is aimed at reducing poverty, infant
mortality and HIV infection.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The drought in Turkana District
in northwestern Kenya is worsening with more areas reportedly in
need of emergency relief supplies, the Daily Nation newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
An early warning bulletin by the World Bank-funded Arid Lands
Management Project said that dry weather conditions continued into
December and the rains in November did not have any significant
impact on rangeland conditions in most parts of the district.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the worsening drought situation, more than
250,000 people were in need of food aid and the number was likely
to go up, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It added that 75 percent of the local population will be in
need of emergency relief aid if there is no improvement in
weather conditions in the next two months.
</P>
<P>
The nutritional condition of livestock in the affected areas
had deteriorated with deaths, especially of sheep and goats, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Turkana District Commissioner Peter Mooke said that there was
little hope of the situation improving in the next one year unless
the rains come.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government, the U.N. High commissioner for Refugees
and non- governmental organizations are taking steps to help the
local population in fighting the drought.

<HEADLINE> More Major U.S. Airlines Impose Domestic Ticket Surcharge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Two more U.S. major
airlines Thursday announced a 20-dollar surcharge on round-trip
tickets, bringing the number of the nation's top airlines that
join price-hiking to 5.
</P>
<P>
Delta Airlines and Northwest Airlines said that they will
surcharge 10 U.S. dollars for one-way trip and 20 dollars for
round-trip of all domestic flights. The surcharge doesn't apply to
international flights.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Continental Airlines imposed the fuel fee on
travel beginning February 1. United Airlines, the country's
biggest carrier, and No. 2 American Airlines followed suit
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Airline officials and Wall Street analysts said the surcharge
was warranted. Continental said its jet fuel costs in the fourth
quarter reached 259 million dollars, 50 percent higher than in the
same period a year before.
</P>
<P>
Increased fuel costs are a direct result of the highest oil
prices in nearly a decade, spawned by the production cutbacks by
major foreign oil countries. The price of the benchmark U.S. crude
oil this week flirted with the 30 dollar a barrel mark, reaching
the highest level since the Gulf War and more than doubling the
level a year ago.

<P>
KUNMING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The people living in the
earthquake-stricken areas of Yao'an County in Yunnan Province,
southwest China, are being provided with all necessities, and
there have been no instances of epidemic disease in the region,
according to the latest report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Schools in the area will be reopened on March 1 as scheduled,
the report added.
</P>
<P>
The Yunnan provincial government on Thursday decided to
allocate an additional 20 million yuan to the initial disaster-
relief fund of more than 10 million yuan for tents and the repair
of reservoirs and other basic facilities in Yao'an, which was
jolted by two strong earthquakes on January 15.
</P>
<P>
At present, emergency rescue operations have been completed in
Yao'an, 200 kilometers west of the provincial capital of Kunming,
and reconstruction has already begun.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan's civil affairs department has secured 700 tents, 2,000
quilts, and rice and other relief materials for Yao'an. The
Ministry of Civil Affairs also contributed 2,000 tents and
disaster-relief funds to the quake area.
</P>
<P>
The city of Shanghai has donated 13 million yuan to Yunnan, and
donations from Hong Kong now amount to two million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The two earthquakes measuring 5.9 and 6.5 on the Richter scale
occurred less than two hours apart, killing five people and
injured 1,544. The jolts also damaged 600,000 houses, with 40,000
collapsed, leaving more than 90,000 people homeless. Direct
economic losses are estimated at one billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
In Yao'an's history, the county was hit by a 6.5-magnitude
earthquake in 1962, and a 5.6-magnitude quake on August 14, 1992.

<HEADLINE> China's Consumer Goods Market Expected to Grow 7.4 Percent This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- China's consumer goods market
is expected to grow by 7.4 percent this year, which would be more
than last year, according to predictions by some market analysts.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that total retail sales of consumer goods hit 3.
11 trillion yuan last year, up 6.8 percent from 1998. If the
factor of lower prices is taken into consideration, the growth
rate in real terms was around 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Guo Shouzhong, an official with the information center under
the State Administration of Internal Trade, said that compared
with last year, sales prospects will be brighter this year.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will continue to enhance efforts to
stimulate domestic demand by the introduction of more favorable
fiscal and monetary policies.
</P>
<P>
Guo said the government's macro-control policies have taken
effect, and cited as one example that the country's stockpiles
have been reduced, and many state-owned enterprises are seeing
better economic returns.
</P>
<P>
Guo added that because the export environment will be better
than last year, the imbalance between supply and demand in the
domestic market will be eased to some extent.
</P>
<P>
However, Guo pointed out that price levels have dropped for 26
consecutive months since 1997, and last year's price level further
declined 0.3 percentage points from the 1998 figure despite
government micro-control efforts.
</P>
<P>
He also cautioned that if domestic demand does not increase and
non-governmental investment is inadequate, China's consumer goods
market cannot be expected to see much improvement.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Struggles through at Australian Open 3rd Round </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Two-time champion Pete Sampras
had to come from two sets down to beat Zimbabwean qualifier Wayne
Black and reach the fourth round of the Australian Open tennis
tournament at the Melbourne Park Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chasing a record 13th grand slam singles title, an out-of-touch
Sampras dug deep to win 6-7 (9-11), 3-6, 6-3, 7-5, 6-3 in a match
he rarely seemed to have control of.
</P>
<P>
After taking the first set in a tiebreaker, Black grew in
confidence, and seemingly in stature.
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until the seventh game of the fifth set that the
American edged to the front.
</P>
<P>
At 3-3 on Black's serve, Sampras took the second of three break
points the Zimbabwean offered to lead 4-3. He then served to go to
5-3 and broke again in the final game.
</P>
<P>
Sampras' fourth round opponent will be either Tim Henman of
England or France's Sebastian Grosjean.

<HEADLINE> China Vigilant Against Possible Polio Outbreaks in Qinghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Extensive immunization programs
have been carried out in Qinghai Province, northwest China, after
a rare case of polio was found last month in an ethnic rural area.
</P>
<P>
Some 134 medical workers have been sent to 154 villages in ten
towns of the Salar Autonomous County of Xunhua, where the rare
polio case was found, to contain the disease and ensure that all
children are vaccinated.
</P>
<P>
A 18-month-old boy in the town of Jiezi was the first reported
case. The virus is believed to have been brought in from outside
China.
</P>
<P>
Health experts are still not sure when and how the virus was
brought into the country, where the last reported polio case was
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Maojia, deputy director of the Xunhua Health Bureau, has
paid a visit to the 18-month-old boy, and has asked local health
department to remain vigilant.
</P>
<P>
Polio often inflicts children and young adults. It is an acute
infectious disease that attacks the motor nerves of the spinal
cord and brain stem, and sometimes results in muscular atrophy and
skeletal deformity.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey shows that most
urban residents in China are happy with the infrastructure
facilities and green belts in their cities.
</P>
<P>
As high-rise buildings and apartments become increasingly
conspicuous and roads replete with flashing night lights and green
belts across cities, a number of respondents said their cities are
becoming more like to international cities.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted at the end of last year in Beijing,
Dalian, Changchun, Harbin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, Jinan,
Zhengzhou, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Xi'an and Lanzhou, by the
Beijing-based China Mainland Marketing Research Company and 13
other information and consulting services firms.
</P>
<P>
Some 53.4 percent said they are satisfied with the development
of their cities, while 17 percent said they were not, according to
the sample survey.
</P>
<P>
Despite efforts to make cities more green, 57.8 percent of
urban residents are greatly concerned about air pollution, and 44.
9 percent of them would like to see improvement in the cleanness
of streets.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Forestry Department of Tibet
Autonomous Region recently approved a plan to create a state-level
natural reserve at the Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
The decision to establish the reserve was made on the basis of
a scientific survey, during which the Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon
was confirmed as the world's longest, deepest, and perhaps most
dangerous gorge.
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of the survey, scientists in Tibet and at the
Beijing-based Chinese Academy of Sciences drew up a detailed plan
for the protection of animal, plants and geological features at
the canyon.
</P>
<P>
The nature reserve will encompass 9,618 square kilometers in
southeastern Tibet where some 14,900 people now live. To protect
the canyon, the regional government has banned any form of
development before a scientific development program is worked out.

Gao Zongze, president of the Bar Association, said it is
inevitable that Chinese lawyers will become part of the

</P>

Apart from law, the training will also involve a broader
knowledge of international politics, economics, culture and

A qualified lawyer will be judged not only on his professional
knowledge of the law, but moral standards as well, and this is

<HEADLINE> CAS to Develop Natural Resources in West China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS) will use advanced technology to help areas in western China
develop the rich natural resources, said Chen Yiyu, vice-president
of the CAS.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has decided to step up development in
the western region of the country for an overall growth of the
national economy after the rapid development in the eastern and
southern coastal areas in the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
The western region of China covers Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu,
Qinghai, Yunnan and Guizhou provinces, Ningxia Hui, Xinjiang Uygur
and Tibet autonomous regions and the city of Chongqing, with a
total area of 5.4 million square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The CAS, the country's top research authority, plans to invest
250 million yuan (about 30 million U.S. dollars) and attract
talented personnel to develop the vast western China.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, the academy will focus on providing key
techniques suitable for the development the Qinghai Salt Lake, and
comprehensive utilization of oil, gas and other natural resources
in other parts of western China.
</P>
<P>
The Qinghai Salt Lake has a large amount of potassium,
magnesium, lithium and other resources of enormous commercial
value.
</P>
<P>
The chemical and petrochemical sector will be among those to
enjoy development priority.
</P>
<P>
The CAS will also promote the tapping and utilization of solar,
geothermal and wind energy in sparsely populated areas which lack
sufficient water and coal resources for power generation.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 21 (Xinhua) -- New T&AMP;T, Hong Kong's fastest-
growing fixed network telecom operator, announced Thursday that it
is spending a further 2.5 billion HK dollars (320 million U.S.
dollars) in the next five years to upgrade its telecommunications
network.
</P>
<P>
This is on top of the 2.7 billion HK dollars (346 million U.S.
dollars) it has already invested in Hong Kong over the past four
years, said Stephen Ng, the company's chairman and managing
director.
</P>
<P>
According to Ng, New T&AMP;T has recently signed a landmark
partnership agreement with China Telecom to inter-connect their
respective fiber optic networks, which will significantly increase
voice and data capacity to support the explosive growth in traffic
to and from the mainland.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, the company has already laid over one million
meters of fiber optic cable and is expected to increase this to 1.
35 million meters by the end of this year. Many of Hong Kong's
prime buildings have already been converted into "e-buildings" by
New T&AMP;T with advanced facilities and features.
</P>
<P>
New T&AMP;T became the first Hong Kong fixed telecommunications
services operator to join a multinational consortium last
September, laying an eight billion HK dollar (1.02 billion U.S.
dollar) trans-Pacific submarine fiber-optic cable linking Japan
and the U.S. that will more than double Hong Kong's total
international telecommunications capacity.
</P>
<P>
The company's e-connection's vision for 2000 has already
started to reshape the telecommunications market and will
consolidate its position as Hong Kong's number two telecom
provider.
</P>
<P>
New T&AMP;T is only one of many Hong Kong telecom companies that
are making big strides in contributing to the Hong Kong's
expansion of e-frastructure in a drive to build Hong Kong into an
e-business hub of the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
According to the Office of the Telecommunications Authority,
Hong Kong's total market for new business lines increased by 5.3
percent last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
Hong Kong plans to speed up the development of the Internet-
based infrastructure in a move to enhance its competitiveness as
an international financial center, a report released recently by
the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) showed.
</P>
<P>
The report recommends that to keep the leading position of Hong
Kong as an international financial center in terms of risk
mitigation, increased efficiency and cost reduction, Hong Kong
should put together an e-frastructure.
</P>
<P>
The e-frastructure will facilitate the development of e-trading
in securities and derivatives in Hong Kong and the Asia-Pacific
region, SFC Chairman Andrew Sheng told a press briefing here.
</P>
<P>
"With implementation of the e-frastructure Hong Kong can aspire
to become one of the leading centers for liquidity, clearing,
settlement and risk management in Asia and the portal for
strategic links with global markets in the region," Sheng said.
</P>
<P>
The report, which has been submitted to Financial Secretary
Donald Tsang, proposes an array of measures to facilitate and
accelerate the implementation of the e-frastructure.
</P>
<P>
Almost all of Hong Kong's large telecom and Internet companies
have joined their efforts to expand Hong Kong's e-frastructure.
The Pacific Century Cyberworks, Hong Kong's largest Internet
company by market value, is not pausing in its moves to widen its
presence in the cyber world.
</P>
<P>
"We want to lead the race for e-commerce, which has already
begun," said Francis Yuan, deputy chairman of the company, while
launching the new head office of iLink.net, a new network
management provider poised to tap the business-to-business e-
commerce in the Asia-Pacific region, which is estimated to be
worth 280 billion U.S. dollars by 2003.
</P>
<P>
CCT Telecom Holdings has also announced that it planned to use
750 million HK dollars (96.2 million U.S. dollars) of the proceeds
to finance the development of a local wireless fixed broadband
telecommunications network and a satellite-based external telecom
gateway.

The Hong Kong-based iLink.net will also focus on small and
medium-size enterprises to get on e-commerce as soon as possible,
according to iLink.net CEO Billy Tam.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's Secretary for Information Technology and
Broadcasting K C Kwong has recently called for joint efforts by
the academia, the industry and the government to promote the
development of electronic commerce in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Electronic commerce, fueled by the exponential growth in
Internet users worldwide and the advances in Internet computing,
was growing by leaps and bounds, Kwong said at the inauguration of
new Masters of Science programs on e-commerce and Internet
Computing launched by the University of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The government fully recognizes the importance of e-commerce
in driving our long-term economic growth," Kwong said, adding: "We
are committed to providing a favorable environment for e-commerce
to take hold and flourish in Hong Kong and are embarking on
various initiatives to achieve this challenging goal."
</P>
<P>
A report released by the Trade Development Council Thursday
said the role of Hong Kong as a financial and telecommunications
hub will be growing since more traffic will be generated between
the mainland and overseas through the region with the mainland's
entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, the number of Internet users has surpassed the
one million mark and is continuing to grow, and the volume of
Internet traffic in and through Hong Kong last year almost doubled
and the number of Internet users making purchases on-line
increased by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Industry estimates suggest that the total value of products and
services transacted over the Internet in Hong Kong will increase
from 60 million U.S. dollars in 1998 to 2.4 billion U.S. dollars
by 2003, indicating that Hong Kong is poised to ride on the
electronic commerce wave.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Establish Embassy in Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is planning to
set up an embassy in Algeria to reciprocate the latter's
establishment of its mission here, Foreign Minister Syed Hamid
Albar said Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said he would raise the matter during his visit to Algeria
which begins next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Malaysian ambassador to Italy is accredited to
Algeria.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the visit was to establish contacts with the new
leadership and to explore new areas of cooperation, he told a news
conference on his visits to Algeria, Oman and Egypt, beginning
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said that during his visit to Algeria, he is
expected to call on President Abdulaziz Bouteflika and Prime
Minister Ahmed Benbitour and his counterpart Youcef Youfi.
</P>
<P>
Total trade between Malaysia and Algeria in 1998 was 60.71
million ringgit (15.98 million U.S. dollars) and Malaysia exported
mainly textile, yarn, margarine and shortening, heating and
cooking equipment while Algeria's exports to Malaysia were
liquefied propane and butane and optical goods.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his visit to Algeria, Syed Hamid will first be in Omar
from January 21 to 23 to attend the Council of Ministers' Meeting
of the 19-member Indian Ocean Rim-Association for Regional
Cooperation (IOR-ARC) which was formed in Mauritius in 1995 with
its objectives including promoting sustainable growth and balanced
development of the region and its members.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the issues to be deliberated by the council
included new membership particularly Pakistan, headquarters
agreement, rules and procedures and the consideration of the
report of the Working Group on Trade and Investment.
</P>
<P>
"As a country situated close to the Indian Ocean, it is logical
for Pakistan to join the group," he said.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid will then pay a visit to Egypt from January 23 to 26,
which he said is a follow-up of the visit by Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad in 1998.

He added that Britain and China have great potential for
cooperation since they are complimentary in many fields.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Chinese vice premier thanked London for
its support in China's bid to join the World Trade Organization (
WTO), and hailed the development in bilateral relations following
Hongkong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
Blair stressed that his country attaches great importance to
its ties with China, and would like to further develop the
relations in not only the field of economy and trade, but also in
politics.
</P>
<P>
Wu met with Secretary of State for Trade and Industry Stephen
Byers on Thursday morning. He arrived here Tuesday for a five-day
official visit before traveling to Belgium and Switzerland on his
current Europe tour.

MANILA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) on Thursday adjourned the
first round of their two-day peace talks without any agreement,
the Business World reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
But they did manage to finalize and approve an agenda for the
second round of talks next month, again in Sultan Kudarat,
Maguindanao, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
MILF Vice chairman for political affairs Ghadzali Jaafar was
quoted as saying after the talks that the negotiators agreed to
meet again in February.
</P>
<P>
"This is only the first round of talks. We still have to meet
many, many times before we could come to a peace agreement," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Jaafar said the negotiators also adopted the agenda originally
set by the government and MILF technical working committees in a
meeting last year.
</P>
<P>
The agenda covers social, cultural, political and economic
issues aimed at solving the Bangsa Moro problem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Joseph Estrada said he will not hesitate
to order an all-out war against Moro secessionists if they persist
in launch offensives against military units in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The MILF has long been fighting for the establishment of an
independent Islamic state in Mindanao, which the government
opposes.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Four Thai soldiers were killed
and five others wounded when they set off a landmine in the
western province of Ratchaburi near the Myanmar border, the
Bangkok Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred on Wednesday when a company of soldiers
was moving towards a hill near a border pass, where a foreign
force was reported to have crossed the border into Thailand, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Two soldiers were killed instantly, the newspaper said. It was
not clear who planted the mine there, it said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Myanmar government forces began a drive
against minority rebels living in Myanmar's Karen state.
</P>
<P>
The rebel group is believed to provide shelters for the five
students who seized the Myanmar embassy in Bangkok last October.
</P>
<P>
Before the landmine explosion, the Thai army received a report
that about 100 armed men from the rebel group had crossed over
into the Thai territory following heavy fighting with the Myanmar
government troops.
</P>
<P>
The fighting caused village tribal people, mostly elderly,
women and children, to flee across the border to Thailand for
safety.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that about 100,000 Myanmar refugees, most of
whom are ethnic Karens, are currently residing along the Thai-
Myanmar border.

LANZHOU, January 21 (Xinhua) -- This year is expected to be a
good year for the state industrial sector in northwest China's
Gansu Province after an economic slump in the past two years.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT)
will provide 100,000 new telephone connections to subscribers this
year, the official Daily News reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
An official of the SLT told the newspaper Thursday that they
hoped to have a million connections within the next three years.
At present there are 600,000 connections.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the SLT was able to provide 133,173 connections and
considerably reduced the existing backlog. There will not be any
backlog within the next two years, he said.
</P>
<P>
The SLT provided only 20,000 connections in 1996, but it
supplied 72,000 connections the next year. The firm created a
record in 1998 by providing 143,075 new connections.
</P>
<P>
The SLT's immediate task is to expedite the provision of new
connections and meet the increased demand in the country, the
official said.

<HEADLINE> Australia's BHP Miners' Strike to Escalate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- A snap nationwide strike in
Australia by BHP coal miners is expected to escalate, with unions
claiming the company has slashed jobs and driven morale into the
ground, the Australian Associated Press (AAP) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
About 4,000 coal workers of the Broken Hill Proprietary (BHP),
Australia's largest mining company, in the states of New South
Wales and Queensland walked off the job Thursday for 24 hours in
support of West Australian iron ore workers.
</P>
<P>
The strike at BHP's Port Hedland and Newman sites began last
Monday night, in protest against attempts to remove collective
bargaining rights.
</P>
<P>
And the dispute is set to escalate, with coal miners
threatening further strike action, the AAP said.
</P>
<P>
Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU)
National Vice-President Howie Fisher said BHP coal miners would
return to work Friday afternoon, but the dispute was far from over.
</P>
<P>
"There's no doubt about it in my mind that there will be more
industrial action," he told AAP.
</P>
<P>
"Workers have no trust for BHP at all and morale is very low,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Queensland Mining Council Chief Executive Michael
Pinnock has criticized coal miners for taking strike action,
saying it was in contravention of the Workplace Relations Act.
</P>
<P>
He said it also coincides with negotiations between Australia
and Japanese buyers for new coal contracts.
</P>
<P>
"It couldn't have been at a worse time," he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt to Set Up Rehabilitation Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government said
it will not provide material compensation to victims of violence,
but will instead seek to compensate them by providing
opportunities for rehabilitation, the Indonesia Observer reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Women's Affairs Minister Khofifah Indar Parawansa said the
government was now making preparations to establish rehabilitation
centers.
</P>
<P>
"We simply do not have enough money for them. The government at
present has no money. I have talked with Vice President Megawati
Soekarnoputri two days ago," Khofifah was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Despite a lack of funds, Khofifah said the government was able
to provide rehabilitation or educational sponsorship to the
children of victims of violence in Aceh and other places.
</P>
<P>
She said her office had met with the Joint Fact-Finding Team (
TGPF) that investigated the May 1998 riots in Jakarta and other
cities, and they reached several agreements.
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed that their investigations must continue and
that the government must make preparations for the rehabilitation
of victims of violence," she said, adding that the rehabilitation
process will be carried out at hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Khofifah said her office will soon sign a memorandum of
understanding with the National Police and the Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Rehabilitation will not only be provided for victims of the May
1998 riots, but will also be provided for victims of violence
elsewhere in Indonesia, such as in Aceh, Ambon and Atambua (West
Timor).
</P>
<P>
Indonesia saw the worst looting and rioting in decades in
Jakarta and other cities from May 13 to 15, 1998. About 1,200
people died, and thousands of buildings and vehicles were damaged
or burnt during the riots.
</P>
<P>
The government set up the TGPF following the May 1998 riots
during which dozens of women of Chinese descent were raped.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Cuts Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Hungary's central bank
Thursday announced that it would cut its benchmark interest rate
by 1.5 percentage points, from 14.50 percent to 13.00 percent,
effective immediately.
</P>
<P>
The move was believed to mark the end of the government's tight
fiscal policy following the 1997 Russian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate for loans for more than one year was also
reduced by the same margin.
</P>
<P>
The rate cut is the bravest move of the central bank in recent
years, compared with many past cuts most often at half a
percentage point.
</P>
<P>
Only one day before, a 1.5-percentage point decline was
announced in the inter-bank overnight loan rate (from 15.75
percent to 14.25 percent) and in the two-week deposit rate (from
13.75 percent to 12.25 percent).
</P>
<P>
The bank's decision to cut interest rates is based on improved
economic performance of the country, said central bank governor,
Suranyi Gyorgy.
</P>
<P>
Hungary's inflation rate is declining year by year, while the
confidence of foreign investors is going up, he added.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, the move marked an end to the tight fiscal
policy introduced after the 1997 Russian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Economists and government officials believed that the bank's
decision will help ward off short-term foreign speculative capital
and is conducive to the government's inflation control targets.

SOFIA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Prime ministers of countries
bordering Yugoslavia are to start a four-day meeting in southern
Bulgaria on Friday to evaluate security risks in the Balkan region
and the impact of the situation in Yugoslavia on the region's
development prospects.
</P>
<P>
Initiated by Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan Kostov, the meeting
will gather Prime Ministers Ilir Meta of Albania, Ljubco
Georgievski of Macedonia, Mugur Isarescu of Romania, Zlatko Matesa
of Croatia, Viktor Orban of Hungary and Haris Silajdzic, co-
president of the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
It will also be attended by Javier Solana, EU representative
for security and common foreign policy, and NATO Assistant
Secretary-General Sergio Balanzino.
</P>
<P>
With no fixed program nor final document scheduled, the meeting
in Hissar, a southern Bulgarian spa resort, intends to send a
truly regional message to the international community, the
Bulgarian government said in a statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"As a country that played a key role in the period of the
Kosovo conflict, Bulgaria very naturally authored the initiative
for a free discussion on the future of peace," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The agenda of the Hissar meeting includes a review of regional
security factors in view of the latest developments in Kosovo, and
the impact of the situation in Yugoslavia on the prospects for
development of the region.
</P>
<P>
Problems arising during the implementation of the Stability
Pact, including the restoration of free navigation along the River
Danube, will also be discussed at the meeting.

<HEADLINE> 350,000 Residents Forced to Flee Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 20 (Xinhua) -- As a result of "ethnic
cleansing" by ethnic Albanian extremists, 793 people have been
killed in Kosovo and some 350,000 non-Albanian residents were
forced to flee since the KFOR peacekeeping forces entered the
Yugoslav province in June last year, the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Of the 793 victims, 705 were ethnic Serbs and Montenegrins, 63
were ethnic Albanians and the remaining 25 from other ethnic
groups, the ministry said in a report released to the foreign
diplomatic corps in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Among those driven out of their homes, 250,000 were ethnic
Serbs and Montenegrins, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry also accused the UN special mission and the KFOR
forces of failing to earnestly implement U.N. resolutions on
Kosovo, saying such a failure had led to the illegal entry of a
large number of illegal aliens and vehicles into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
During the seven months, about 200,000 foreigners illegally
entered Kosovo from neighboring Albania and Macedonia, of whom
many were members of international terrorist groups and crime
syndicates.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some 250,000 cars were illegally transported to
Kosovo from Albania and Macedonia, most of which were stolen, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia withdrew its troops and police force from Kosovo in
June last year after NATO conducted a months-long air strike
against the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Calm returned to the riot-torn
tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia on Thursday as the death toll
rose to five in the four days of riots, according to national
newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the West Nusa Tenggara police Capt. Agus Sutisna
said the five died of gunshots from security personnel who tried
to quell crowds that tried to set fire to residents' houses.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen people were injured in the riots after they resisted
security personnel despite warning shots.
</P>
<P>
The unrest occurred in Mataram, Lombok, following a religious
gathering protesting the protracted ethnic bloodshed in Maluku
province.
</P>
<P>
After the gathering, thousands of angry people destroyed places
of worship and houses. At least 10 places of worship were set
ablaze in the riots.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Observer quoted a resident as saying that
rioters only looked for Christians.
</P>
<P>
According to Antara News Agency, the mobs not only vandalized
and burnt down places of worship but also looted and torched shops.
Two warehouses which kept basic commodities at Cermen village were
also looted.
</P>
<P>
As of Thursday night, no arson or looting was reported. Over 1,
500 military and police personnel have been deployed to restore
order on the island. Security was tight at several entrances to
the island and its vicinity.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to prevent an escalation of the unrest, military chief
Admiral Widodo A.S. Thursday urged the public not to hold any mass
gatherings.
</P>
<P>
"I have ordered my officers across the country to ask local
leaders not to hold mass gatherings," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a group of eight Muslim clerics and a prominent
Islamic community leader issued a joint statement calling on
Muslims to end the violence.
</P>
<P>
The group called on the people of Lombok to "bring back unity
and brotherhood" to the island.
</P>
<P>
However, the exodus of refugees and tourists fleeing the riot-
torn Mataram continued, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Vows to Rescue More Children From Exploitation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian government plans
to prevent more children from being exploited in labor markets by
increasing the number of children involved in the Child Labor
Eradication program from 145,000 to 362,000, President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso announced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso made the remark during the signing of two agreements
here with the International Labor Organization.
</P>
<P>
Under the two new agreements, children below the age of 16 will
not be allowed to work, compared with the previous age line of 14.
They also seek the elimination of the worst forms of child labor.
</P>
<P>
The program forbids children's involvement in infantile
prostitution, slavery and drug trafficking, which causes extensive
damage to their mental and physical health, security and morality.
</P>
<P>
The program, which began in 1996, establishes that urban
children up to 14 years of age will be awarded 40,000 reals (
approximately 23 U.S. dollars) after they go to school instead of
working, while children in rural areas will be given 25,000 reals
(14 dollars) if they do so.

<HEADLINE> Silicon Valley Firm Releases New Chip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- A Silicon Valley startup on
Wednesday unveiled a family of "smart" computer chips that it
claimed may revolutionize the cyber world.
</P>
<P>
The chips, called the Crusoe, were developed by Transmeta, a
California-based company founded by chip designer David Ditzel in
1995.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference here, the company said the Crusoe chip
runs on low power and voltage, leading to longer battery life --
up to one full working day. The chip will power everything from
full-fledged laptop computers weighing as little as two pounds to
new types of emerging devices like "Web pads" and handheld
computers.
</P>
<P>
Unlike hardware-based chips, the Crusoe chip is a software-
based design. It removes the complexity and high expense of
designing a processor by putting that complexity into software
rather than into silicon.
</P>
<P>
As the technology backer of Transmeta, IBM has agreed to
manufacture Crusoe chips in its plants worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts praised the low-cost chip and said it might
shake up the semiconductor market and force industry leader Intel
to cut its prices and develop a rival chip.
</P>
<P>
The name Crusoe comes from the famous fictional traveler
Robinson Crusoe, who was washed up on an island after a shipwreck.

HAVANA, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Cuba expects 2 million foreign
visitors this year after tourist arrivals last year dropped by 50,

<HEADLINE> Poland's Banishment of Russian Diplomats Worsens Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, January 20 (Xinhua) -- Poland's expulsion of nine
Russian diplomats on spying charges Thursday worsened already
uneasy bilateral relations, with Moscow threatening to react to
the abjection.
</P>
<P>
The Polish Foreign Ministry summoned Russian Ambassador to the
ministry Thursday and informed him that nine of his country's
diplomats were "persona non grata" in Poland, because they were
detected by Polish security services engaging in "active espionage
operations," an official statement said.
</P>
<P>
Officials refused to elaborate what the Russians were accused
of, or to what degree it harmed the interests of the Polish state.
</P>
<P>
It was unclear whether the spying activities had been directed
at Poland's NATO links, commercial targets, or other areas, and
whether the diplomats would have to leave Poland at once.
</P>
<P>
Challenging the Polish move, the Russian Foreign Ministry said
Thursday that it would respond to the banishment, describing it as
an "unprecedented step" which hurt bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian side cannot leave unnoticed such explicitly
unfriendly and provocative action," the ministry said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Polish government should realize that appropriate response
measures become inevitable," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The relationship between Poland and Russia became uneasy after
Warsaw applied to join the NATO defense pact. Poland, a former
Warsaw Pact satellite of Russia during the Cold War, was accorded
membership of the Western alliance in March last year.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports quoted Polish ministry sources as saying
they expected some of their diplomats in Moscow would be expelled
in retaliation.
</P>
<P>
Polish Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek, on an official visit to
Portugal, said counter-intelligence agents had gathered detailed
proof of Russia's spying. He said he hoped that relations with
Russia would not be badly damaged.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Plans Stock Option Contracts with More SOE Managers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing municipal
government is to introduce stock option contracts on a trial basis
to more state-owned enterprises (SOEs) this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Mayor Liu Qi, ten more high-tech companies, key
enterprises and listed companies in Beijing will be selected this
year for the stock option contract experiment, a means the
government sees will help streamline SOEs of the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, SOE managers will obtain a certain amount
of stocks on installments at an agreed price during their tenure
and get returns two years after they leave their posts.
</P>
<P>
Only after the managers' performance is assessed as up to
agreed standards can they cash their stocks, according to Zhang
Xianping, a city official in charge of the experiment.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government last year selected ten companies as
the first group of SOEs to try the new reform measure. They are
now either busy with management system transformation or working
to draft details for carrying out the experiment, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The result of the reform measure is yet to been seen.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 20 (Xinhua) -- The first NBA slam dunk
competition in three years should be a good one, with the high-
flying Vince Carter heading an exciting six-man field.
</P>
<P>
Carter has been acknowledged as the heir apparent to Michael
Jordan as the most electrifying dunker in the NBA. The 6-6 guard
also leads all Eastern Conference players in voting for the All-
Star Game.
</P>
<P>
Also named to the slam dunk roster were Larry Hughes of
Philadelphia, Golden State's Antawn Jamison, Jerry Stackhouse of
Detroit, Houston rookie Steve Francis and Carter's teammate and
cousin -- Tracy McGrady of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
Jamison also has ties to Carter as both played for the
University of North Carolina from 1996-98. Stackhouse also is a
North Carolina product.
</P>
<P>
The NBA Slam Dunk will be on February 12 during All-Star
Weekend at Oakland, California. It has not been held since 1997,
when Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers won as a rookie out of
high school.
</P>
<P>
Last year's All-Star Weekend was canceled due to the lockout
and the previous season's dunk contest was scratched from the list
of events in favor of 2ball -- a team competition between NBA and
WNBA stars.
</P>
<P>
The six players will be competing for a $65,000 purse, with $25,
000 going to the winner. Second place is worth $15,000, third
place is worth $10,000 and fourth through sixth is worth $5,000.
</P>
<P>
Past champions include Jordan, fellow two-time winners
Dominique Wilkins and Harold Miner and the 5-6 Spud Webb. Larry
Nance won the first competition in 1984.
</P>
<P>
This year, TNT and NBA Entertainment will unveil a jump meter --
a new technological device that instantly measures the height each
player reaches when dunking.

<HEADLINE> Ruins Dating Back 3,800 Years Unearthed in Shaanxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Ruins dating back 3,800 years
were recently unearthed by archeologists in Shaanxi Province in
northwest China.
</P>
<P>
The ruins at Donglongshan, three kilometers east of the city of
Shangzhou in southeastern Shaanxi, are believed to belong to the
early Xia dynasty (21th-16th Century BC). This was the first such
discovery in the province.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the excavations will provide valuable
references for studying and accurately apportioning the lengths of
the Xia, Shang (16th to 11th Century BC), and Zhou (11th Century-
226 BC) dynasties, China's first three dynasties.
</P>
<P>
A team from the Shaanxi Provincial Institute of Archeology last
year uncovered 10 housing ruins, 37 tombs, a number of stone
knives with perforations, and stone axes, bone articles, and
pottery at the site. This followed the discoveries of several
ruins dating back to the Shang Dynasty and later Xia Dynasty at
the start of the excavation. The excavation began in 1997 covering
an area of 400 square meters.
</P>
<P>
Experts have found that a majority of the decorations on the
articles and pottery are unlike those unearthed at the Erlitou
Site, which is believed to have been the capital of the Xia
Dynasty, in central China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
But items unearthed earlier at Donglongshan are quite similar
to those found at the Erlitou Site.
</P>
<P>
Based on this, Yang Yachang, an assistant researcher in charge
of the excavation, believes that the newly found ruins were
created by a tribe in the early Xia Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
China's chronological records date from the year 841 BC during
the Western Zhou Dynasty (about 11th Century to 771 BC). Dating
the earlier Xia and Shang dynasties remains obscure because of the
lack of written records.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government organized a research project in 1996 in
an effort to discover this "missing history," which has inspired
many legends and anecdotes.

TIANJIN, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin recorded 24.8 billion

1998.
</P>
<P>
According to local customs, there were 10.9 billion US dollars
of imports, up 23.5 percent from 1998, mainly due to government's
policy adjustments and a crackdown on smuggling. There were 13.9

<P>
ANKARA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- A total of 29 people have been
killed and 119 others injured in traffic accidents caused by heavy
snowfalls in Turkey since last week.
</P>
<P>
The government continued to warn motorists of the danger of
driving on roads covered by ice and snow, urging them to carry
necessary equipment such as snow chains, the Anatolia News Agency
reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Due to the harsh winter conditions throughout the country, the
Turkish Football Federation suspended for a week matches scheduled
to be played in the Turkish Division Three Soccer League.
</P>
<P>
Istanbul Stock Exchange suspended its first session of trading
this week because snowfall hampered inner-city transport and many
brokers were unable to reach the stock exchange building.
</P>
<P>
Many minor roads linking villages are still blocked by heavy
snowfalls in eastern and central Anatolia as well as in the
northern Black Sea region, leading to the close of many schools in
these areas.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Airlines was forced to cancel a lot of flights,
especially those to and from airports in eastern and central
Anatolia.
</P>
<P>
Although the snowfalls have caused chaos and serious problems
for many people, farmers in southeastern Anatolia have been
enjoying the snowfall, which they expect will boost this year's
harvest.
</P>
<P>
Meteorology reports said that Turkey will remain under the cold
front until next Wednesday with temperatures expected to fall as
low as minus 12 degrees celsius.

<HEADLINE> Germany Understands Russia on Chechnya: Fischer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Germany does not question Russia
's Right to crush terrorism in the breakaway republic of Chechnya
and understands Moscow's position on the North Caucasus issues,
said German Vice-Chancellor and Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The German leadership does not question Russia's rights and
duties to apply anti- terrorist efforts in Chechnya," Fischer said
at a meeting with Russian acting President and Prime Minister
Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, who arrived here Thursday, stressed that "No one is
thinking of changing the Russian Federation's borders and
internationalizing the conflict."
</P>
<P>
Fischer believed that, "From a political viewpoint, it is very
important that observers from the Council of Europe be present in
the North Caucasian region."
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Putin stressed that the representatives of
international organizations who had requested trips to the region
got such an opportunity. They "saw for themselves the complexity
of the tasks being solved in the North Caucasus not only in the
military sphere but also in restoring the economy," said the
president.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the North Caucasus was in focus of the Friday'
s protracted meeting, said Sergei Prikhodko, deputy chief of the
Kremlin Staff after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Putin believed that a major task in Russia's relations with
Germany today is "to stem some recession and prevent political and
economic contacts (between the two nations) from interruption,"
Prikhodko said.
</P>
<P>
During Fischer's visit in Russia, the two sides also confirmed
that their bilateral political relations must not have breaks,
Prikhodko said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides came to this conclusion after the Moscow
negotiations between Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov from one side and Fischer from the other.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations resulted in an agreement that, after the
presidential elections in Russia, Russian-German top-level
consultations will be held, Ivanov told a Friday briefing on the
results of Fischer's visit.
</P>
<P>
Fischer in his turn pointed out Russia's important role in
European and global processes. In particular, as he put it, "the
war in Kosovo demonstrated that Russia played and will play an
important role in maintaining stability and peace in Europe."
</P>
<P>
The German Foreign Minister also expressed a hope that Russia's
relations with the West will improve. In Fischer's opinion, there
may also be certain progress in Russia's relations with NATO (the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization) in view of NATO's General
Secretary's visit to Moscow scheduled for February.

</P>
<P>
According to the Canadian International Development Agency (
CIDA),the minister made the announcement during a nine-day tour in
South Africa and its neighboring countries.

<P>
The contribution is delivered to a project funded by CIDA to
help address regional migration problems, which are linked to the
increased transmission of HIV/AIDS, conflicts and impoverishment.
</P>
<P>

programs by accelerating the spread of HIVE/AIDS, creating new
conflicts and resulting in greater poverty and inequality," said
Minister Minna.
</P>
<P>
The contribution enables Queen's University of Canada to bring
together decision makers from six southern African countries in

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Records Budget Surplus in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Department reported that revenue for December 1999 totaled
201.2 billion dollars while expenditures came to 168.1 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
December's surplus was bigger than the 32.5 billion dollars
projected by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).
</P>
<P>
For the first three months of fiscal year 2000, which began Oct.
1, the government is running a deficit of 20.6 billion dollars.
But a budget surplus is expected for all of 2000. The Clinton
administration is predicting a 142.5 billion dollars surplus for
fiscal 2000, while the CBO is expecting 161 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
For all of fiscal year 1999, which ended Sept. 30, the
government reported a record surplus of 124.4 billion dollars,
slightly more than previously estimated.
</P>
<P>
The surplus in 1999 followed a 69.2 billion dollars surplus for
1998.If a surplus materializes for fiscal 2000 as expected, it
would be the first time the government reported three consecutive
years of surpluses since 1947-1949.
</P>
<P>
In December, the government revenue from individual income tax
payments came to 94.54 billion dollars, compared with 75.99
billion dollars for the same month in 1998. Corporate income tax
payments totaled 44.95 billion dollars, up from 42.37 billion
dollars in December 1998.

<HEADLINE> Indian Demonstrators Take Ecuadorian Parliament Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Groups of Ecuadorian Indians and
of other ethnic and social background took Friday the National
Congress building, with the support of a group of young armed
forces members, to protest against the government's economic
policies and to demand the dissolution of the three powers of the
State.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators announced that they do not recognize the
authority of President Jamil Mahuad, and demanded the installation
of a joint military and civil governing board, at the same time
they demanded Mahuad's resignation and the dissolution of the
Parliament, the closing of the Supreme Court of Justice and the
derogation of the dollarization of the economy measures in force
in this country since January 10.
</P>
<P>
 Local radio reported that General of Division Carlos Moncayo
Gallegos, in charge of maintaining public order in the zone of the
capital of the country, had permitted the demonstrators enter the
Parliament building, but he had explained that he did not have any
relation with the rebellion of the young military personnel who
support the Indians uprising.
</P>
<P>
Moncayo told the press that the taking of the Parliament by the
indigenous groups and others is a show of the popular inconformity
that has been manifested with the taking of the legislative palace.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Armed Forces do not support the indigenous
groups position about the dissolution of the powers of the state,
but that they cannot either oppose them and cause damage to the
indigenous population.
</P>
<P>
He said that the support of a group of military personnel to
the indigenous demonstrators in the taking of the Parliament is
not an insubordination, but an interpretation of the defense of
the interests of the nation.
</P>
<P>
Moncayo denied that he had personally backed up the position of
the indigenous people by permitting their entrance to the
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
"I have not headed any revolt nor permitted the entrance of the
groups of indigenous people. What I did was to control the peace
and the tranquillity of the citizens, and in the first place, to
prevent a confrontation," said Moncayo.
</P>
<P>
The military personnel who took part in the revolt that ended
today with the taking of the National Congress will be subjected
to the military laws, he added.
</P>
<P>
It could be seen during the revolt of the indigenous people who
took the Parliament building that a group of young Ecuadorian
military personnel, commanded by Colonel Lucio Gutierrez and
Captain Cesar Diaz, backed up the attitude of the indigenous
people.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Ukraine Reach Accord on Gas Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Ukraine on Friday
here reached an agreement on Ukraine's natural gas debt payment
and the creation of a unified energy system of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During a one-day working visit in Moscow by Ukrainian Premier
Viktor Yushchenko, Ukrainian delegation and Russian natural gas
monopoly Gazprom agreed on a mechanism and deadlines for Ukraine
to pay arrears for Russian gas supply this year.
</P>
<P>
A protocol signed by Yushchenko and Gazprom chief executive Rem
Vyakhirev indicated "the correct calculation of the debts" and"how
to pay" them, said the Russian side.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine is to finish the calculations by February 1, Vyakhirev
said. "On February 1 or 2 they will report the results to us."
</P>
<P>
Money will make up a small proportion of the payments. The rest
will take the form of goods and Russian securities.
</P>
<P>
The goods will be worth a total of 500 million U.S. dollars,
Vyakhirev said. Russia has already received 275 million dollars
worth of goods, he added, meaning strategic bombers that Ukraine
is handing over to Russia. Three Tu-160 and three Tu-95 bomber-
planes have already arrived in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Proposals for Gazprom to buy stakes in Ukrainian enterprises
under privatization projects were not on the agenda for the talks
that preceded the arrears agreement, Vyakhirev said.
</P>
<P>
He also said a contract on more gas exports to Ukraine will be
made before Sunday.

<HEADLINE> IMF Urged to Help Palestine in Developing Economic Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat said Friday that his government needs the International
Monetary Fund to help it develop sound economic and financial
policies.
</P>
<P>
Visiting the IMF's Washington headquarters for the first time,
Arafat said the IMF already had provided advice that enabled the
Palestinian Authority to overcome many hurdles in establishing
institutions and laws.
</P>
<P>
"We still need that valuable help, support and technical
assistance of the IMF to help us develop a new financial and
economic structure," he said.
</P>
<P>
Before going to the IMF, Arafat held talks with World Bank
President James Wolfensohn.
</P>
<P>
Neither the bank nor the IMF provide financial aid to the
Palestinian Authority because it is not a member of either
organization. But both institutions help raise money for the
Palestinians with member governments and advise how these funds
should be spent.
</P>
<P>
Stanley Fischer, acting managing director of the IMF, greeted
Arafat in the marbled-floor atrium at IMF headquarters and said
the organization was working with the Palestinians on "setting up
an economic policy framework that will last for many years to come.
"
</P>
<P>
An IMF staff team will visit the West Bank and Gaza before the
end of January as part of the effort to develop a comprehensive
economic policy framework.

<HEADLINE> Britain Hands Back Ancient Sculpture To Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 21 (Xinhua) - The sculpted head of an Egyptian
queen was handed back to Egypt at the British Museum Friday, 10
year after it was smuggled to Britain.
</P>
<P>
The damaged sculpture, known as the Meryet Head, was part of a
haul taken out of Egypt by a restorer who received a six year jail
sentence in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The model of Nefertari, wife of Pharaoh Rameses II, dates back
to the 13th Century BC. It was smuggled into Britain 10 years ago
disguised as a cheap tourist souvenir.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the museum said: "The whole issue about
whether it should be returned to Egypt was pinned on whether it
was an original because its owner claimed that it was a fake. We
have been able to prove that it was an original."
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Ambassador Adel El-Gazzar told a press conference:
"The decision to return the head to Egypt represents an important
victory in the ongoing fight against the illegal trade in
archaeological artifacts around the world."
</P>
<P>
"We are sending a message and setting a precedent that both
Egypt and the UK are determined to pursue this illegal trade and
to bring to justice those who are involved," he added.

<HEADLINE> Italian Official Defends Management of Aid Mission to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Franco Barberi, Undersecretary at
the Civil Defense Department of the Italian Interior Ministry
Friday defended his management of a scandal-hit Kosovo
humanitarian aid mission, saying that cries for his resignation
were unjustified.
</P>
<P>
Italian Police Thursday detained four employees of the so-
called Rainbow Mission for Kosovo refugees in Albania on charges
of embezzlement, fraud and other crimes, but Barberi insisted that:
"My management of the Civil Defense Department, and not just the
Rainbow Mission has always been carried out with maximum
transparency."
</P>
<P>
"It is in our interests above all that all the details of this
sad affair are clarified," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It involves the entire department because it is a stain (on
our reputation), although it is always necessary to distinguish
between individual behavior and overall responsibility in an
agency," he continued.
</P>
<P>
"If I resign now, it would be like abandoning the ship in the
middle of a storm," he concluded.
</P>
<P>
Opposition demands for Barberi's resignation have been mounting
since Thursday, when Bari prosecutors ordered the detention of
four Mission workers, as the result of an investigation opened in
September into the Rainbow-run camp in Vlore of Albania.
</P>
<P>
Those detained included Massimo Simonelli, the field director
of the Italian aid mission in Albania who has served for 18 years
in the Civil Defence Department, and Luciano Tenaglia, the manager
of the Vlore camp.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors were also seeking Rhami Isufi, a 45-year-old
Albanian businessman from Vlore suspected of being an organized
crime boss.
</P>
<P>
Bari prosecutors were also swift to defend Barberi Friday
afternoon, saying that his delicate handling of the case and
collaboration with investigators had helped them enormously.
</P>
<P>
Public prosecutor Michele Emiliano said that Barberi had been
aware of the charges against the defendants and had, "by remaining
totally reserved, allowed the judicial authorities to lead the
suspects out into the open."
</P>
<P>
The Rainbow Mission was set up on April 1, shortly after NATO
started its air raids against Yugoslavia, to funnel the donations
of almost 70 million U.S. dollars and other aid offers to help the
hundreds of thousands of Albanian Kosovars fleeing their homes.
</P>
<P>
The Camp of the Regions at Vlore was opened on April 28 and
gave a temporary home to 5,200 refugees.
</P>
<P>
According to published statements by Simonelli, the Camp of the
Regions cost 30,000 lire (about 16 U.S. dollars) a square metre
compared to 21,000 lire in other camps. Daily expenditure in each
refugee came out to 1,800 lire per head.
</P>
<P>
The investigation into how the camp was run began after the
news weekly, Panorama, published a videocassette shot by an
Albanian cook showing the looting of the camp, apparently by
Albanians, on July 10 last year, the day on which the Italians
handed the facilities over to the Albanians.

<P>
The train was passing through a rail yard when a railroad
employee spotted flames shooting from a valve used to relieve
pressure in the tankers. It wasn't known what sparked the fire.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted local fire officials as saying that they
feared the fire threatened a half-million gallons of propane in
nearby freight cars. But crews managed to uncouple the others from
the burning tank, which contained about 33,000 gallons of liquid
propane.
</P>
<P>
It was unclear whether authorities would let the propane burn
itself out or whether they would attempt to extinguish the blaze,
the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Propane can travel up to two kilometers if it explodes,
depending on how much propellant it contains. It also can be
harmful if inhaled.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Boy's Grandmothers Arrive in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I came here to tell you all and to ask you to finish this
tragedy that has been so hard for us as a family, and to ask you
that our grandson can return as soon as possible," Quintana,the
boy's grandmother, said through an interpreter at the airport.
</P>
<P>
An Associated Press report from New York said that before
boarding the plane in Cuba, the women kissed and embraced Elian's
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who remained in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
He has said he does not want to have to visit the United States
to get his son. Cuban officials say they fear enemies of Cuba's
communist government will hinder his return to Cuba with a
subpoena to appear before Congress.
</P>
<P>
Dan Burton, an anti-Cuba Congressman who cosponsored the
notorious Helms-Burton Act against Cuba, said he will subpoenaed
Elian to decide whether the boy should be returned or not.
</P>
<P>
Elian was rescued on November 25 from sea near Florida after
his mother and stepfather were killed when their boat capsized in
an effort to come to the United States illegally.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) early
this month ruled that the boy belongs to his father and should be
returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
However, the boy's relatives in Florida insisted the boy should
stay in the United States. Anti-Cuban politicians in the United
States tried to use the boy to attack Cuba, saying the boy will
face both physical and mental harm if he returned to Cuba because
of the Caribbean islands' social system.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration believes that the boy should be
returned to Cuba and politics should be avoided in handling the
process.
</P>
<P>
In Miami, Elian's great-uncle Delfin Gonzalez said the family
has no plans to allow Elian to go to New York to meet his
grandmothers, but said they were welcome to come to Miami.

The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 99.59 at 11,251.71
for the fourth consecutive drop. The index fell 471.27 points or 4.

</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index fell 4.21 at 1,441.36 and the technology heavy Nasdaq
composite index rose 45.89 at 4,235.40, surpassing the record
closing high of 4,189.51 points set Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Blue chip stocks fell as rise in crude oil sparked fears of
inflation that would prompt the Federal reserve to raise interest
rates. Crude oil prices have risen more than 4 U.S. dollars a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange this week, climbing
toward 30 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve raised rates for the three times last year
to keep inflation at bay. Analysts believe the central bank
officials will likely raise rates again at the Open Market
Committee meeting on February 1-2.
</P>
<P>
But the Nasdaq index rose as investors moved their money away
from cyclical stocks into the big-name technology companies like
Cisco Systems.
</P>

The NYSE index fell 0.93 at 639.58. But the American Stock
