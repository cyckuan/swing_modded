<P>
LUANDA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. oil company Texaco has
expressed its interest in the liquefaction of natural gas in
Angola, official source said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Vice-president of Texaco John O'connor is now in Luanda for a
working visit, during which he met with the Angolan Minister of
Petroleum Botelho de Vasconcelos on a possible project of the
liquefaction of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
According to O'connor, the project will advance step by step,
and other oil companies will also participate in the development
of the enterprise.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue our work and we are sure that in near future
we will see the results of the work," said O'connor.
</P>
<P>
Angola, the second largest oil-producing country in Africa, is
also abundant in natural gas reserves. Due to the lack of
technology for handling the natural gas emitted from oil wells, 85
percent of the emitted gas has been burned on the spot.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Army Sends Reinforcements to Battlefield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government has sent
reinforcements to re-gain the control of Waco Cungo after the
rebels seized some strategic positions in the town.
</P>
<P>
A military source asking not to be identified said that fierce
fighting continued around Waco Cungo, southeast of Kwanza-sul
Province, but the rebels had gotten an upper hand after four days
of battles.
</P>
<P>
The military source hoped that the arrival of reinforcements
could help the Armed Forces of Angola (FAA) control the situation
in the central highland, where the government troops launched a
38-day general offensive against the rebels on September 18.
</P>
<P>
The counterattack on the town of Waco Cungo is the first
reported operation by the rebel National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) since the capture of major rebel
strongholds of Bailundo and Andulo in late October.

HARARE, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) taskforce on immunization in Africa has provided 228 million
U.S. dollars to support efforts by African governments to wipe out
polio by the year 2000, a WHO official said here on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Joint Appeal Made for Polio Vaccine in Bid to Eradicate Paralyzing Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Major organizations in the
global effort to eradicate polio issued here Friday a joint
emergency appeal for vaccines to root out the paralyzing disease.
</P>
<P>
Marking World Disability Day, Director-General of the World
Health Organization (WHO) Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, Executive
Director of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) Carol
Bellamy and former Director at Rotary International Carl-Wilhelm
Stenhammar made the extraordinary appeal to donor governments to
come forward with the necessary funding for the additional 700
million polio vaccines doses still needed for next year.
</P>
<P>
As part of a fast-track approach to eradicate polio by the end
of year 2000, additional vaccination campaigns have been scheduled
for extra doses of polio vaccine worth 50 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"We have a window of opportunity to eradicate polio forever,"
said Brundtland. "We are seizing that opportunity and accelerating
the campaign in the next 12 months to deliver a polio-free world
to the children of the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
"On this World Disability Day, we urge donors to invest in the
Polio Eradication Initiative which will bring annual savings of 1.
5 billion dollars to tackle other disabilities," she said.
</P>
<P>
Less than 50 countries are the key to success. These include 10
priority countries that account for most of the world's polio
cases: Afghanistan Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia,
Sudan, Bangladesh Ethiopia, India, Nigeria and Pakistan.

<P>
LONDON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The International Petroleum
Exchange (IPE) plans to launch futures contracts for electricity
in the second quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
The new markets - under the new electricity trading
arrrangements (NETA) due to begin in October 2000 - were discussed
at an industry working group Firday organised by the IPE.
</P>
<P>
A number of detailed issues were raised which include the
possibility of introducing cash settled contracts before NETA is
launched.
</P>
<P>
The IPE announced its attention to launch electricity contracts
for the new trading arrangements in May 1997 and has worked
closely with the industry subsequently to identify and meet its
requirements.
</P>
<P>
The UK Natural Gas futures contract was launched by the IPE in
January 1997. Many companies involved in the electricity sector
are already using this as a risk management tool.
</P>
<P>
Once the IPE launches electricity contracts, companies may be
able to offset their exposure across the two different markets and
reduce their transaction costs accordingly.

<HEADLINE> Bush Defensive in First Campaign Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Taxas Governor George W.Bush
was defensive on Thursday evening in the first nationally
televised campaign debate among the Republican presidential
hopefuls in Manchester, the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Republican presidential front-runner withstood repeated
criticisms about his positions on taxes, Social Security and other
issues from his rivals for the party's presidential nomination in
the debate.
</P>
<P>
Publisher Steve Forbes, who was the most aggressive, criticized
Bush for considering raising the Social Security retirement age
and also raised questions about George W. Bush's youth.
</P>
<P>
Bush, avoiding any major gaffes in his first face-to-face
meeting with the presidential contenders, stressed his record as a
two-term Texas governor. "I know how to lead," he said.
</P>
<P>
He refused to directly answer questions about whether he has
used illegal drugs, but he said that "I did some irresponsible
things when I was young and irresponsible."
</P>
<P>
Bush also had to defend his knowledge of foreign policy and his
record on the environment as well as his reading habits.
</P>
<P>
During the debate, the Republicans haggled over taxes, abortion,
Social Security and their qualifications for the White House.
</P>
<P>
The debate, the first of three debates this month, was held in
New Hampshire, a state that holds the first primary on February 1
for 2000 U.S. presidential election. Bush and his five rivals were
questioned by two television reporters.
</P>
<P>
Arizona Senator John McCain, who was considered to be the main
rival of George W. Bush, has closed the gap in some polls in New
Hampshire, but trails far behind Bush in other states. The other
three contenders are Utah Senator Orrin G. Hatch, talk show host
Alan Keyes and conservative activist Gary Bauer.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pak, India Have No Other Option But to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and India, the two
South Asian rival neighbors having a history of tension and wars,
should be keenly interested in dialogue for maintaining peace and
stability to ameliorate the lot of their impoverished peoples.
</P>
<P>
Following the exchange of usual hard-hitting statements in the
wake of last month's military takeover in Islamabad, the two
governments have signaled their willingness to resume their
stalled talks aimed at resolving their outstanding issues which
have bedeviled their relations during the more than 50 years of
their simultaneous independence.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts here noted that the two countries are
obviously divergent in their positions on the proposed dialogue
which has come to a deadlock since early this year.
</P>
<P>
After he assumed the office last month, Pakistan's Chief
Executive General Pervaiz Musharraf has on several occasions
offered "unconditional, meaningful and result-oriented dialogue"
with India, particularly on the main issue of Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf, who is concurrently chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff Committee and the army chief, also ordered the withdrawal of
additional Pakistani troops deployed along the international
borders in the wake of the Kargil crisis in disputed Kashmir area
in August which had brought the two nations to the verge of war.
</P>
<P>
The recent agreement between Pakistani and Indian border forces
not to alter the status of working boundary and to put an
immediate stop to firing across the border is a positive
development in the relations between the two estranged neighbors.
</P>
<P>
However, the Indian side has a different opinion on resuming
the stalled dialogue. Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
has said Pakistan must first take steps to restore confidence
before the two sides can start talking again.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the political change since the military coup on
October 12, Vajpayee said, "the ground reality is hardly conducive
to resumption of meaningful dialogue. Let Pakistan first take
steps to restore confidence and create the right atmosphere for a
meaningful dialogue."
</P>
<P>
He said if Pakistan was interested in resuming peace talks, it
should "first follow the Simla Accord and the Lahore Declaration
in true letter and spirit."
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe in entering into new agreements and simply
ignoring the previous ones," said Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani side, however, is rather critical of the Indian
position which "confines only to some provisions of its liking in
the bilateral agreements" for resumption of talks.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar said Pakistan will
honor and implement its obligations under the international
agreements, treaties and resolutions of the U.N. Security Council.
It cannot agree to conditions for dialogue based on "arbitrarily
selected provisions of some agreements or their unilateral
interpretations."
</P>
<P>
Analysts here are of the view that Pakistan and India will have
no other option but to talk in a bid to improve their strained
bilateral relations and to solve all of their outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
One would wonder that when the armies of both countries stare
eyeball-to-eyeball, when the main Jammu-and-Kashmir dispute
remains unresolved, and especially when the two are now nuclear
armed, what else can be if these are not sufficiently compelling
reasons for a sincere attempt at dialogue.
</P>
<P>
There is virtually no argument in the international community
after the respective nuclear detonation by India and Pakistan in
May last year that the main issue affecting the bilateral
relations between the two South Asian nations is Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Since their inception in 1947, Pakistan and India have fought
three wars, two of which directly on Kashmir, for which the two
peoples have paid heavy prices.
</P>
<P>
India accuses Pakistan of fomenting Muslim insurgency in
Indian-held Kashmir. However, Pakistan denies the charge and
maintains it provides "only moral, diplomatic and political
support to Kashmiri freedom fighters."
</P>
<P>
Irshad Ahmed Haqqani, former information minister and
commentator, said Pakistan has also been stressing for the
creation of a favorable atmosphere for the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
However, he said "by this we meant that India should stop human
rights violation in Kashmir and withdraw its troops from there."
</P>
<P>
"Neither country can make a straight offer or even come up with
a clear statement regarding talks without attacking conditions and
qualifications," Dawn, a major English daily, said recently in an
editorial.
</P>
<P>
It further said that "an effort should be made to clear not so
much the concrete barriers as the mental cobwebs to that the two
countries, their relations fraught and frozen during the whole
course of this year, can begin anew the process of talking to each
other."
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the two countries must have an inherent capacity
to move forward instead of remaining perpetual hostage to the
mental blockages of the past.
</P>
<P>
However, it is believed that any such effort must be grounded
in realism instead of an enthusiastic but vague desire for peace.
</P>
<P>
This is important because, without the will to tackle real
problems, tensions will remain high and peace and stability in the
region will be an elusive prospect.

<HEADLINE> UN Envoy to Visit Lebanon on Israeli Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-general Kofi
Annan's envoy Terry Larson is due in Beirut next Monday for talks
about the growing possibility of a unilateral Israeli withdrawal
from south Lebanon, foreign ministry sources said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The primary aim of Larson's visit to Lebanon is to assess what
role the U.N. could play in the event of an early unilateral
Israeli pullout from south Lebanon, the source added.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak recently repeated his pledge
to withdraw his troops from south Lebanon by July 7, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been in control of parts of Lebanon since 1978 and
set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with
the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese guerrilla'
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Larson will inspect the U.N. peacekeeping force and confer on
the spot with field commanders at the force' headquarters in the
southern border town of Naqoura.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said the envoy is likely to sound out Lebanon
about doubling the force' 4000-strength to include French and
other multinational peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.'s Interim Forces in Lebanon, which was installed
after the Israeli first invasion of Lebanon in 1978, consists
of soldiers from Ireland, Ghana, Nepal, Fiji, India, Finland,
Poland, France and Italy.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Researchers Find AIDS-Smallpox Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Canadian researchers have
discovered" an unexpected link" between AIDS and smallpox, opening
new frontiers for developing ways to block AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The finding clarifies why some people are immune to HIV
infection while enhancing hopes that human beings would eventually
eradicate AIDS as they did with smallpox in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Local media said Friday that the discovery was made by
researchers in the University of Western Ontario and the
University of Alberta.
</P>
<P>
The researchers have found that "the two most important human
plagues in history" use the same route of entry to invade cells.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion coincides with the fact that the AIDS virus, or
HIV, is not able to enter the cells of about 1 percent of
Caucasians, who do not have chemokine receptors as a result of
genetic mutation of 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
Scientists speculate that the mutation protecting people from
HIV emerged under an environmental pressure from an infectious
disease.
</P>
<P>
It was smallpox that likely caused this mutation to spread in
the human population, according to Canadian researchers.
</P>
<P>
People without this "lock" survived the epidemic hundreds of
years ago, passing the lucky mutation on to their descendants, who
then enjoy an immunity to AIDS as well, they said.
</P>
<P>
"People who have the mutation are otherwise healthy," said
Grant McFadden, a professor and world-renowned expert in pox
viruses with the University of Western Ontario.
</P>
<P>
"That means there might be tricks you could develop to mimic
the genetic mutation, and prevent people from getting HIV," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The "groundbreaking" discovery began with a series of
experiments in Professor McFadden's lab and with University of
Alberta graduate students brainstorming over beer, according to
local media reports.

KUWAIT CITY, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Four unidentified gunmen
in a stolen car fired several shots early Friday at soldiers
guarding the house of Kuwaiti Interior Minister Sheikh Mohamed
al-Khalid al-Sabah, an interior ministry statement said.
</P>
<P>
At about 04:30 (01:30 GMT), the guards noticed the car, whose
lights were off and had no front license plate, passing in front
of Sheikh Mohammed's mansion and making a full U-turn just in
front of the main gate of the house, the statement quoted a
security source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The interior minister is living in Fintas Area, some 40
kilometers south of the capital Kuwait City.
</P>
<P>
The source said the car matched the description of a vehicle
reported stolen the previous night which aroused the suspicions
of the guards, who stopped it and ordered those inside to step
out.
</P>
<P>
But instead of getting off, the source said the men fired
at the guards, who fired back forcing them to flee.
</P>
<P>
Patrols found the car abandoned about six hours later, in
which some empty cartridge clips and drugs were collected.
</P>
<P>
Search is underway for the four persons, the security source
said, without speculating if the incident has connection with the
nation-wide campaign against drugs.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's Interior Ministry launched a war against drugs
trafficking, dealing and abusing early October. Up to now, more
than 200 people have arrested and over 200 kilograms of various
kinds of drugs seized.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Minister vowed to continue the campaign until
the drug problem is up-rooted in the small Gulf emirate.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Criticizes Barak's Statements on Golan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League on Friday
criticized Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak for his recent
statement that the late Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin's
pledge to withdraw from Syria's Golan Heights is not binding.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Mohammad Zakareya Ismail, Arab League
Assistant Secretary General, also chided Barak for claiming that
relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions do not apply
to the occupied Palestinian territories and that no third party
should undertake any role in mediating the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Barak's remarks have astonished the Arabs as he has always been
"marketing his desire to push forward the peace process and to
attain regional stability and cooperation with Arab countries"
since his election in May, Ismail said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Barak's statements demonstrated Israeli
arrogance and excessive feeling of supremacy in disregard of the
international community and even the future and welfare of the
Israeli people.
</P>
<P>
Such arrogance will certainly frustrate not only the Arabs but
also the world community, which is exerting efforts to revive the
multilateral talks and the Middle East and North Africa economic
conference, the league official said.
</P>
<P>
Both events, which were suspended due to the hard-line policy
of the former Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, were
aimed at boosting economic cooperation between Arab countries and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Ismail warned that Barak's policies will lead the peace process
to a dead end.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between Syria and Israel came to a halt in
early 1996 due to disputes over Israel's withdrawal from the Golan
Heights, which was captured by the Jewish state in the 1967
Mideast War, and related issues.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have expressed interest in resuming the
negotiations. Syria insists that Rabin had promised to pull back
Israeli troops from the Golan and the talks be resumed on this
basis, while Israel maintains that the negotiations be restarted
without precondition.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The proximity talks
between the Greek Cypriot leader Glafcos Clerides and the Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash opened on Friday at the Headquarters
of the United Nations in New York.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said the U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan this morning met Clerides first and then he met
Denktash
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said there would be no further talks for Friday
and the talks would be resumed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. brokered proximity talks mean that Clerides and
Denktash are within reach but will not meet face to face, and U.N.
coordinators will shuttle between them.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. said the talks will focus on distribution of powers,
property, territories and other issues.
</P>
<P>
 The talks, aimed to prepare the ground for the later direct
talks, are expected to last a couple of weeks and the 15th of
December is the targeted date of the conclusion of the talks.
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. told the press that there will be no regular
briefings on the talks unless the U.N. Secretary-General feels the
need to do so.

<P>
LUANDA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States has complied
with the sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council
against the Angolan rebels and will help reinforce its
implementation, a U.S. diplomat said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with the Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos, visiting U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Richard Holbrooke
said that before his visit to Africa, he had discussed with Robert
Fowler, president of the Sanction Committee of the Security
Council, on the necessity of the reinforcement of the sanctions
against Jonas Savimbi's National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke announced that the U.S., which is to assume the
presidency of the U.N. Security Council next month, will convoke a
special meeting on the issue of Angola which he said will discuss
how to improve the implementation of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke said he was given a briefing of Angola's view on the
situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and
stressed that his country supports the peace accord signed in
Lusaka, Capital of Zambia, and its effective implementation.
</P>
<P>
His African tour designed to mediate the conflict in the DRC
began at Mali before he came to Angola. He will also visit
Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Rwanda, Uganda, the DRC
and Tunisia.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Divided on Iraq's Oil-For-Food Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council on Friday is continuing the consultations on the
U.N. oil-for-food program in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member Council is divided over whether the extension
should be for one week or another period of six months.
</P>
<P>
Before the Security Council, there are two options. One favors
an additional week extension of the current phase six of the
humanitarian program until next Saturday, which was proposed by
the United States and supported by Britain and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The other one seeks another six months' technical rollover of
the program, which is supported by Russia, France and China.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. officials, the Council will probably vote in
favor of the U.S.- proposed one-week extension of the program, but
only by a narrow margin.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food program, which began to be implemented in
late 1996, is aimed to ease the deteriorating humanitarian
situation in Iraq caused by the stringent U.N. sanctions against
it.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food program, Iraq is allowed to sell 5.2
billion U.S. dollars worth of oil in every six months to buy food,
medicine and other necessities for its people.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council on November 19 decided to extend the
current phase of the program for two weeks until December 4, a
stopgap of the Council. The six phase of the program began on May
25, 1999 and should have expired on November 20.

HARARE, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe said here Friday he is hopeful that the international
community will soon take steps to ensure effective implementation
of the peace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC).
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when presenting certificates to 103 local

</P>
<P>
"Zimbabwe remains committed to the promotion of peace in the
sub-region, the whole African continent and the the world at
large," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said this is evidenced by the deployment in recent years of
troops to the peace process in Mozambique, Somalia, Angola, Rwanda
and the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe also toured the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) Regional Peacekeeping Training Centre, which was opened
earlier this year.

to strengthen the efforts for regional cooperation, collective
self-defense and mutual understanding.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Sees Accessibility Key to Ensuring Opportunities for Disabled People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a message marking the International Day of Disabled Persons,
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said for more than half a
billion people in the world, accessibility could mean an education,
a job and a community that would otherwise be denied them.
</P>
<P>
"It is a key to the exercise of their civil, political, social
and cultural rights," Annan said, urging countries to build truly
accessible, caring and inclusive societies.
"This is a major concern of the United Nations, rooted in its
founding principle of the equality of all human beings."
</P>
<P>
As computer-based communications and learning are becoming more
widespread, special needs must be taken into account, the U.N.
chief said. Otherwise, the technological revolution would be lost
for many talented people and their contributions would be lost to
the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
In her statement, Gro Harlem Brundtland, director-general of
the World Health Organization (WHO), said it was necessary for U.N.
agencies to devise and implement a common agenda on disability.
</P>
<P>
"A more comprehensive effort is needed, at both the national
and international levels, linking prevention with rehabilitation
and equalization of opportunities," Brundtland said.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Office in Islamabad, Pakistan, said
that after 20 years of conflict, about 800,000 Afghans have become
disable due to war, landmines, polio and poor basic health care.
About half of the country's disabled population suffers from
sensory handicaps such as blindness, deafness and multiple sensory
impairment.

<P>
ABUJA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Some 154,800 farmers will benefit
from a farmer empowerment program to be launched by the government
next year, Nigeria's Agriculture Minister Alhaji Daura said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The program, which costs the government 11.5 billion naira (121
million U.S. dollars) annually, will enable beneficiaries to
procure oxen-drawn bullocks, plows and carts, the minister told a
visiting Japanese delegation.
</P>
<P>
He said each of the farmers will receive 75,000 naira (768 U.S.
dollars), which will be repaid over five years at an interest of
10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The development of agriculture is a major pillar of the
economic program of the new civilian administration, which was
inaugurated on may 29 this year.
</P>
<P>
Daura called for Japanese assistance in a planned program by
the government to cultivate rice whose quality could be compared
to that imported.
</P>
<P>
Japanese assistance would be in the area of pesticides and
machinery, he added.

<P>
The statement came in Gurirab's message to mark the
International day of Disabled Persons, which falls on December 3.
</P>
<P>
"Accessibility issues affects all of us," he said. "They are
essential to the full and effective exercise of the political,
civil, economic, social and cultural rights that are enshrined in
the Charter of the United Nations as well as various international
human rights instruments."
</P>
<P>
"Accessibility is not a technical term designating access to
public facilities or information services," he said. "It is an
underlying objective of social awareness which affects all
dimensions of human activities in all societies."
</P>
<P>
"On the eve of the new millennium, and with the rapid pace of
change, it becomes especially important that we promote
accessibility for all," he said.
</P>
<P>
This year's theme for the International Day of Disabled Persons
is "Accessibility for all in the new millennium." The General
Assembly designated the International Day on December 3, 1982. The
annual observance on December 3 provides the international
community with opportunities to consider the rich contributions
made by persons with disability to the societies in which they
live.
</P>
<P>
"There is growing awareness and support for comprehensive
approaches aimed at advancing the well-being of persons with
disabilities, particularly through the application of relevant
international conventions and ethics," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The international community needs to intensify its efforts to
strengthen national capacities and institutional capabilities of
developing countries to extend more opportunities by and for
persons with disabilities for their full and effective
participation in society and development," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our collective efforts should be focused on raising awareness
and promoting greater understanding of the practical development
needs of persons with disabilities," he said. "In this way we will
be able to further promote respect for human rights and encourage
concerted action to equalize opportunities by, for and with
persons with disabilities."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Gets No Response from Iran on Bomb Probing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Friday that it had asked Iran for cooperation on the probe into
the bombing of Kohbar Towers in Saudi Arabia in 1996, but had got
no responses.
</P>
<P>
"We have not received from the government of Iran the kind of
responses we have been hoping for," State Department spokesman
James Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
In August, President Bill Clinton sent a message to Iranian
president Mohammad Khatami through U.S. Assistant Secretary of
State Martin Indyk and Bruce Reidel of the National Security
Council, seeking cooperation for the investigation of the bombing
of Kohbar Towers, which killed 19 American servicemen.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the Iranian response had tended to be "hidebound and
unimaginative."
</P>
<P>
The United States, while seeking cooperation with Iran in
combating international terrorism, has been continuing its
accusation that the government of Iran reneges on promises to
abandon support for terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Iran, under the U.S. accusation, has reasonably refused any
suggestion about cooperation.
</P>
<P>
And Iran also has already denied its involvement in the bombing
of Kohbar Towers and Rubin could not but acknowledge that
Washington could not reach any conclusion regarding whether the
attack was directed by Iran.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Endemic Wolves on Verge of Extinction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The number of "Key
Keberos", Ethiopian endemic wolves, is declining remarkably in the
northern parts of the country, a wildlife conservation
organization said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Leykun Abune, leader of the National Parks Coordinating Team,
said that in some parts of the Semein Mountains, which is believed
to be the origin of the Ethiopian wolf, the endemic animal has
completely disappeared.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the sharp decline in the number of the animal to
deforestation, illegal hunting, rabies and hybridization of the
species with dogs in the area.
</P>
<P>
The total number of Ethiopian wolves in the area was less than
20, Leykun said, adding there were no more than 500 Ethiopian
wolves across the country.
</P>
<P>
According to Claudio Sillero, coordinator of the Ethiopian wolf
 conservation program, efforts have been underway to rescue the
endangered animals in the Bale Mountains National Park, Oromia
State.
</P>
<P>
A program involving the local farmers has been launched to
deliver the endemic animal from extinction, the coordinator said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are some 250 Ethiopian wolves in the Bale
Mountain National Park, Claudio said.

"They condemned those Burundian parties, including the
Government, that have demonstrated their commitment to continue
negotiations, and called on those parties that remain outside the
process to cease hostilities and for their full participation in
Burundi's inclusive peace process," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council recognized Burundi's "dire economic and
social conditions and the need for the donor community to expand
assistance for Burundi," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Security Council voiced a welcome to the
designation at the 8th Arusha regional summit of Mandela as the
new Facilitator for the Burundian peace process, the statement
said, adding that the Council members "were grateful for his
willingness to take on the task of searching for a peaceful
solution to the crisis and offered their full support."
</P>
<P>
Mandela was appointed as the new mediator in Burundi's fragile
peace process to replace Tanzania's former president Julius
Nyerere who died in October.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Security Council "encouraged all parties to show
flexibility and to cooperate fully with the new facilitator," the
statement said. "They looked forward to the earliest possible
resumption of the talks," which began in June 1998 and made little
headway.
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed that "only a negotiated settlement can
bring peace, stability and prosperity to Burundi."
</P>
<P>
Fighting between Burundian government troops and Hutu rebels
has killed more than 200,000 people since 1993, when Tutsi
paratroops killed Burundi's first democratically elected president,
a Hutu.
</P>
<P>
Hutus make up the majority of Burundi's 6.5 million people, but
the minority Tutsis have controlled the Central African country's
government, army and economy for all but four months since
independence in 1962.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi Friday expressed the belief that the relations
between his country and China in trade and investment would be
further strengthened in future.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in his office with the Chinese economic and trade
delegation led by Xu Bingjin, assistant minister of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation, Meles said that the promotion of
bilateral relations has been a priority in the work of the
Ethiopian Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is willing to further its relations with China in
various fields on the basis of mutual interest, Meles said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Meles appreciated the financial and
technical assistance that China had offered to Ethiopia, adding
that there still exists a great potential for cooperation between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that Ethiopia is expecting more Chinese
 entrepreneurs to invest in it and to get involved in technical
management in its enterprises.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Reject Week-long Extension of U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraq will reject a week-long
extension of the oil-for-food program considered by the United
Nations Security Council, the oil minister said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival to attend a meeting of Arab oil ministers, Amir
Muhammad Rashid said the possible decision is "an evil and
meanless step aimed at blackmailing the Security Council permanent
members which are trying to push the United States and Britain to
agree to lift economic sanctions."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under international trade embargo since its 1990
invasion of Kuwait. The U.N.-Iraqi oil-for-food program allows
Baghdad to sell 5.2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil every six
months to buy food and medicine for the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The planned one-week extension is not practical, Rashid said,
adding that if the U.N. Security Council adopts a relevant
resolution, Iraq would "turn it down just as (the country) did
with an earlier two-week extension proposal."
</P>
<P>
Iraq stopped exporting oil after the Security Council voted to
extend the program for just two weeks when the last six-month
phase expired on November 20.
</P>
<P>
The United States reportedly is pushing for the U.N. Security
Council to extend the program by one week when it votes on the
matter later Friday.
</P>
<P>
But three permanent council members, namely Russia, China and
France, oppose the United States and Britain on key aspects of the
comprehensive package. They support the usual six-month extension
of the oil-for-food program.

<HEADLINE> Honduras Asks UN, OAS to Send Observers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Honduras requested Friday
the presence of observers from the United Nations and the
Organization of American States (OAS), a preventive measure of its
crisis with Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
Honduran Foreign Minister Roberto Flores Bermudez denounced "
the disproportionate reaction maintained by Nicaragua" in an
urgent message sent to U.N. and OAS secretaries general Kofi Annan
and Cesar Gaviria respectively.
</P>
<P>
The crisis between Honduras and Nicaragua detonated Tuesday
after the Honduran Congress ratified a maritime limits treaty with
Colombia. According to Managua, it detaches from Nicaragua 130,000
square kilometers of its territorial waters in the Caribbean sea.
</P>
<P>
Flores Bermudez said that this Honduran legitimate action has
made Nicaragua use an undue tone and aggressivity against Honduras
that threatens the continuation of Central American integration.
</P>
<P>
"The Nicaraguan reaction shows a threatening attitude against a
sovereign juridical action realized by my government that deserved
the approval and welcoming from many representatives of the member
countries, including that of the president of our organization (
OAS) Permanent Council," said the communique.
</P>
<P>
Honduras establishes in the note that it proposed to Nicaragua
the road of dialogue for a solution, in a relaxed atmosphere and
through the procedures advised by international law, of any
disagreement or misunderstanding that the juridical act may have
created.
</P>
<P>
The Honduran authorities also protested officially before the
Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry the mobilization of troops of the
neighboring country, considering it imprudent and contrary to a
reduction of the tensions.
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguan Foreign Vice Minister Guillermo Arguello Poessy said
Thursday in a letter addressed to Honduran Foreign Minister
Roberto Flores Bermudez that Nicaragua has not ordered the
deployment of troops to its northern border with Honduras.
</P>
<P>
Honduran Defense Minister Edgardo Dumas said that Honduras has
not moved troops to the border and will maintain those that are
normally permanent in these sectors.
</P>
<P>
The Honduran armed forces suspended Thursday the operation
against drug trafficking they were realizing in the Platano River
biosphere, close to the border with Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of withdrawal of those forces is to prevent the
presence of armed personnel in that zone that could motivate
intentionally false interpretations," said Dumas.

<HEADLINE> Turnout Rate Reaches 80 Percent in Mozambique's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's second
presidential and parliamentary elections since 1994 ended its
first polling day on Friday satisfactorily with a turnout rate of
about 70-80 percent, Chairman of the National Elections Commission
Jamisse Taimo said.
</P>
<P>
He said that 90 percent of the 8,324 polling stations across
the country were opened for voters to cast ballots, only 10
percent of them failed to operate as a result of heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
According to Taimo, the central Zambezia Province, also the
second largest constituency with 49 parliamentary seats, was hit
hardest by heavy rains. The largest constituency is the Nampula
Province, which has 50 parliamentary seats out of the country's
total 250 seats.
</P>
<P>
According to the electoral law, the two-day polling may be
extended for a third day if there is any heavy rain discouraging
voters from walking to the polling stations or standing in queues,
he said, adding that the Technical Secretariat of the Electoral
Administration is considering this possibility.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The government and
the rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) started
Friday their fourth round of peace talks, expecting a Christmas
and New Year ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
"The truce is being considered by the FARC secretariat," said
Fabio Valencia Cossio, one of the government negotiators, after a
consultation with guerrilla spokesman Raul Reyes.
</P>
<P>
Colombian President Andres Pastrana proposed that all the
actors of the internal armed conflict should cease hostilities for
30 days, starting December 15.
</P>
<P>
The right-wing paramilitary groups also announced their
willingness to respect the truce, in the same way as the Self
Defense Group of the department of Antioquia, which accepted it
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We will abstain from carrying out any of our activities of a
political, military, or intelligence nature during the period
between December 15 and January 15," said the paramilitary group
in a communique.
</P>
<P>
The United Self-Defenses of Colombia (AUC), the biggest
paramilitary group, raised a condition for the truce that it must
be observed by the guerrilla as well.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the six government negotiators and the three of the
FARC's examined Friday the first of the 12 chapters of the agenda
that will be submitted to public debate.
</P>
<P>
The theme of respect for human rights is the first in the
agenda, but it is possible that others will be analyzed, said the
negotiator Valencia.

WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- After 11-month space flight,
U.S. NASA's Mars Polar Lander touched down Friday near the south
pole of the red planet, but scientists have not receive any signal
from the spacecraft yet, now they are still waiting for signals to
confirm the landing.
</P>
<P>
Along with the lander, the two little space probes called Deep
Space II, should also smashed into the planet at 400 mph.
</P>
<P>
U.S. scientists hope the 90-day mission will help them to learn
more about Mars' geology, climate and potential for supporting
life, including possibly future visits by humans. The Polar Lander
equipped with a robotic digging arm, will focus on analyzing soil
samples for signs of water, an important element for life.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth U.S. craft ever to have landed on the red
planet and the first time landing on the south pole area.
</P>
<P>
The 30 million Deep Space project is part of NASA's new
Millennium program, a series of inexpensive missions testing

WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. orders to factories for
manufactured goods dropped by 0.2 in October, reflecting a sharp
10.4 percent drop in demand for electronic and electrical
equipment, the Commerce Department said Friday.

However, orders for industrial machinery and equipment which
included computers jumped 1.7 percent, following a 0.7 percent
decline in September. And orders for transportation equipment rose
1.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Rejects Use of Force in Territorial Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan Foreign Minister
Jose Vicente Rangel said Friday that Venezuela will not use force
to resolve territorial disputes with other countries of the region.
</P>
<P>
Rangel made this statement when he was consulted about the
dispute Venezuela maintains with Guyana about the Esequibo
territory.
</P>
<P>
"We will never use force to recover national territory because
Venezuela has never been an aggressor country. We believe in
diplomatic negotiations and, for this cause, we have sent the case
to the procedures of good offices," said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
"There is not any possibility that Venezuela would assume an
aggressive attitude, as it was said in the Guyanese and Caribbean
communication media not long ago on the occasion of the Paris
Decision centennial," added Rangel.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela has been reclaiming the 159,500 square- kilometer
soil for the last 100 years. It was given to the former British
Guyana by the Paris Arbitrating Court, formed by two British
judges, one Russian, and two from the United States on Oct. 3,
1899.
</P>
<P>
The decision of the Paris Court made Venezuela recur in 1966,
exactly 65 years after the arbitrating decision had been
established and a little before Guyana had gained its independence
from Great Britain, to the United Nations in Geneva for its
mediation.
</P>
<P>
The case was put in the hands of the U.N. secretary general in
March of 1983, who appointed as mediator Grenadian Alister
McIntyre.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Russian Officials to Hold Talks on Iraq </HEADLINE>

<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Friday that Russian ambassador to the United Nations is back to
New York for talks with U.S. officials on a U.N. resolution to
allow Iraq to continue exporting oil and also permit the return of
U.N. weapons inspectors to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly hope that that discussion makes it possible for
us to move forward with the broadest possible support for a U.N.
resolution," State Department spokesman James Rubin said at a
briefing.
</P>
<P>
He said Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov spoke with U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright earlier in the day about the
latest development.
</P>
<P>
"So we would expect those consultations to intensify in the
coming week," said Rubin, adding that the United States has not
set a date for when it wants to present the resolution to the U.N.
Security Council for a vote.
</P>
<P>
We certainly believe that the time has come to move quickly to
a vote, and that we should move to a vote very, very, very soon,"
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Washington wants to link Iraq's ability to sell oil with the
return of U.N. inspectors to make sure Baghdad is not rebuilding
its program to develop weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Until a new weapons inspection policy is worked out, the
Clinton administration wants only a short-term extension for Iraq'
s oil-for-food program. Iraq opposes this idea and as a protest
has stopped shipping oil.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEATTLE, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Ministers from Latin American
and Caribbean countries at the third ministerial meeting of the
World Trade Organization (WTO) Friday officially expressed their
anger at the poor organization of the meeting to the United States.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique, the ministers expressed their "profound
surprise and resulting anger at the organization and lack of
concern for providing the high dignitaries and delegates"
attending the meeting "with minimum conditions of security, and
for allowing... physical and verbal aggression against its
distinguished guests."
</P>
<P>
A Colombian delegate was beaten by several protesters Tuesday
when the delegate tried to go to the Washington State Convention
and Trade Center, where the meeting was convened.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of protesters blocked and occupied the streets near
the conference venue in the city Tuesday. Delegates were stopped
from entering the meeting and some suffered from verbal and
physical aggression by the protesters.
</P>
<P>
An opening session for the meeting was canceled.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon has mobilized the National Guards, active duty
soldiers, including a small number of Special Forces troops, to
crackdown the protests in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of protesters rallied Thursday in front of the King
Jail in downtown Seattle, chanting slogans demanding the release
of more than 400 protesters arrested since the demonstration
started early this week.
</P>
<P>
The police used tear gas, rubber bullets and sticks to disperse
the demonstration and dozens were injured. Windows were smashed in
downtown and shops had to be closed.
</P>
<P>
The 24-hour-a-day curfew in downtown announced by Seattle Mayor
Paul Schell Tuesday remains in effect until midnight Friday after
the conference ends.
</P>
<P>
Trade ministers from 135 WTO members are meeting in the city to
define agenda for the next round of global trade talks. Many
delegates failed to reach the venue of the conference Tuesday due

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Jean-Michel Severino, World
Bank vice president for the East Asia and Pacific region since
1997, announced Friday that he would be leaving the World Bank by
March of 2000 to reunite with his family in France.
</P>
<P>
Severino, 42, was appointed vice president in 1997 and guided
the region through the East Asia crisis. He oversaw a dramatic
increase in lending, from 37 projects worth 4.9 billion U.S.
dollars in fiscal year of 1997 to 55 projects for 9.8 billion
dollars in fiscal 1999, the World Bank said.
</P>
<P>
"His departure is a great loss for me and his colleagues," said
World Bank President James D. Wolfensohn in a letter to staff. "We
value him as an outstanding contributor to our mission of
alleviating poverty, and as an excellent leader and manager."
</P>
<P>
Severino joined the World Bank in 1996 as director in the
Europe and Central Asia region, where he was responsible for
Bosnia. He will be returning to the Inspection Generale des
Finances, a body of the Ministry of Finance of France.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Once Again Extends Current Phase of Oil-For-Food Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council Friday night adopted a resolution by a narrow
margin to extend the sixth phase of the U.N. oil-for-food program
in Iraq for an additional week until December 11.
</P>
<P>
A total of 11 members of the 15-member Security Council voted
for the resolution, three abstained and one did not participate in
the vote.
</P>
<P>
China, Russia and Malaysia abstained and France did not
participate in the vote.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution was proposed by the United States by
which it sought to pressure the Security Council to reach
agreement on a new comprehensive policy towards Iraq in the next
week.
</P>
<P>
The move is a stopgap of the Security Council which failed to
hammer out the renewal of another six months of the oil-for-food
program.
</P>
<P>
The phase six of the program began on May 25, 1999 and should
have expired on November 20. The Council on November 19 decided to
extend the program for two weeks until December 4.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food program began to be implemented in late 1996
and is aimed to ease the humanitarian crisis in Iraq which has
been under stringent U.N. sanctions since its invasion of Kuwait
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, Iraq is allowed to sell 5.2 billion U.S.
dollars worth of oil in every six months to buy necessities for
its people.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Good jobless and inflation
reports propelled Wall Street stocks in the sky Friday, lifting
the Dow Jones industrial average close to the record high and
other two indexes to the new records.
</P>
<P>
The Dow closed up 247.12 or 2.2 percent at 11,286.18, the
second-biggest point gain of the year. That left the blue chip
index 40 points shy of the record closing high of 11,326.04 set on
August 25.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators also rose sharply. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rose 24.26 at 1,433.30 and the technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index rose 67.85 at 3,520.63, setting the new
records both.
</P>
<P>
The market rallied strongly as the labor Department reported
that the U.S. unemployment rate matched a 30-year low of 4.1
percent in November while average hourly earnings grew by a scant
0.1 percent to 13.41 U.S. dollars in the same month. The report
gave a fresh evidence that inflation remains under control despite
the tight labor market.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment report was closed watched on Wall Street
because recent economic data showed a mixed picture. Investors
were concerned about the hot economy when reports said new home
sales shot up 16.3 percent in October and consumer confidence
index rose more than five points in the same month.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE rose 9.57 at 646.73 and the American Stock Exchange
index rose 1.72 at 835.25. The Russell 2000 index of smaller
companies rose 4.14 at 464.58.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,828 up, 1,269 down and 467
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 984.62 million shares from 890.13
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Derby Manager Charged by FA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- English premier league football
club Derby County manager Jim Smith has been charged with
misconduct by the Football Association (FA) following an outburst
aimed at an assistant referee.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred during the Rams' Premiership fixture with
Manchester United last month, when he also described referee Mike
Reed's performance as "biased".
</P>
<P>
The veteran manager was angered after Birmingham official Reed
sent off Stefan Schnoor and booked four other home players at
Pride Park during the November 20 match, which United won 2-1.
</P>
<P>
Schnoor was dismissed for two bookable offences, first for
dissent towards an assistant referee and then a minute later after
fouling Dwight Yorke.
</P>
<P>
The red card was shown to the German after United players David
Beckham and Gary Neville ran up to the referee imploring him to
take action.
</P>
<P>
Along with the "biased" comment, Smith also said: "In my
opinion the referee wasn't going to do anything and reacted to two
United players' demands.
</P>
<P>
"The referee was on first-name terms with them but he doesn't
know our players well enough. He asked how Posh Spice was, where
they were eating tonight and then sent our fella off," he said.

<P>
LONDON, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Former world champion Jacques
Villeneuve said on Friday that he would stay at British American
Racing (BAR) next season.
</P>
<P>
Villeneuve made the statement after BAR confirmed that Craig
Pollock would be responsible for the management and running of the
business side of the team.
</P>
<P>
Villeneuve had repeatedly said that if his former school
teacher Pollock went he would follow and he had been widely tipped
to return to Williams -- the team with which he won the title two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
In a BAR statement, Villeneuve said: "...I believe that BAR,
having gone through very difficult times in 1999, now has the
management structure to be competitive very quickly.
</P>
<P>
"I am very much looking forward to being with the team during
the 2000 season."
</P>
<P>
Neither Villeneuve nor Brazilian team mate Ricardo Zonta
managed to register BAR's first point in F1 in a maiden season
during which Villeneuve said his car's reliability was "pathetic".
</P>
<P>
Next year BAR's cars will be powered by Honda engines.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan Foreign Minister
Eduardo Montealegre Friday addressed a note to his Honduran
counterpart, Roberto Flores Bermudez, protesting against the
deployment of Honduran troops on the border with Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
Montealegre said in his letter, "The Nicaraguan government has
learned that the Honduran army is realizing concentrations of
troops and materials as well as special deployments toward the
border with Nicaragua."
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan minister said that "such activities, besides
promoting instability and anxiety in our populations, do not
contribute to strengthening the friendly relations between the two
countries."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister told the press that Organization of
American States Organization (OAS) General Secretary Cesar Gaviria
talked personally with him, denying that the OAS had supported the
ratification of the Honduras-Colombia treaty.
</P>
<P>
The crisis between Honduras and Nicaragua detonated Tuesday
after the Honduran Congress ratified a maritime limits treaty with
Colombia. According to Managua, it detaches from Nicaragua 130,000
square kilometers of its territorial waters in the Caribbean sea.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called Friday for a peaceful
resolution and said the United Nations is ready to provide any
assistance.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general is following the issue closely and has
called on all parties concerned to continue their efforts to seek
a peaceful resolution of this controversy," said Annan's spokesman
Fred Eckhard.

<P>
SEATTLE, December 3 (Xinhua) -- African countries complained
Friday that they had been shut out of the consultations at the
critical stage of the third ministerial conference of the World
Trade Organization in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
"The ground rules that were accepted in Geneva as the way to
proceed are being undermined in Seattle by the powerful countries,
" Tetteh Hormeku from the Africa Trade Network said at a press
conference Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
He complained that the United States, the European Union and
Japan have transferred the negotiations away from the working
groups where the negotiations should be taking place into
corridors, the green rooms and super green rooms, where 25
ministers, instead of all 135, discuss the most difficult issues,
excluding most of the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"There is too much behind the scene cooking, this is just
nonsense," lamented a frustrated member of the Namibian delegation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) issued a
statement, saying that there is no transparency in the proceedings
and African countries are being marginalized and generally
excluded on issues of vital importance.
</P>
<P>
"If African delegates are unable to make their positions known
through the formal structures of the WTO, then they stand little
chance of making sure that these real issues are addressed," said
Mohau Pheko from South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The African Trade Network and the OAU urged non-government-
organizations and civil society groups in the United States and
the European Union to "call on their governments to behave
according to the rules and stop being big bullies."
</P>
<P>
Some African delegates even threatened not to sign any deal if
they are not seen to be transparent and not be able to join the
consensus required to meet the objectives of the on-going Seattle
conference, due to end late Friday.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists on Decoding of Chromosome 22 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Deciphering the complete
genetic sequence of chromosome 22 by a trans-national research
group is like opening the first page of the book of life, said
Chinese scientists.
</P>
<P>
"It is the first time for human beings to 'read' a chromosome
with complete gene sequence,' said Zhang Meng, director of the
Human Genome Research Center of the Institute of Genetics under
the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
He said that scientists from six countries including the United
States, Japan, Germany and China are joining forces to decipher
100,000 human genes within 15 years.
</P>
<P>
"It is like composing a 'dictionary', which can explain the
function of each kind of gene in the human body," said Zhang,
adding that the key to the whole project is the sequencing of DNA.
</P>
<P>
"The successful deciphering of the first chromosome has given
scientists more confidence in decoding other chromosomes, " he
added.
</P>
<P>
Chromosome 22 is the second smallest among 23 human chromosomes,
but its deciphering means a lot to scientists all over the world
who are participating in the human genome research project, said
Shen Yan, a research fellow from the Beijing Human Genome Research
Center.
</P>
<P>
He said that the research finding, which was made by a research
group with 216 scientists from the United States, Britain, Japan
and other countries, also indicates a general trend of trans-
national cooperation between scientists, especially for huge
research projects such as the human genome project.
</P>
<P>
"The finding will also help scientists observe causes for some
genetic diseases, because chromosome 22 contains some disease-
related genes," said Wu Xiyan, a researcher at the Shanghai Human
Genome Research Center.
</P>
<P>
Inspired by the success of scientists from other countries,
Chinese scientists are making harder efforts to accomplish one
percent of the gene sequencing, from the international human gene
project.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia to Partially Recast Presidential Votes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The presidential vote in 230
polling stations in western Macedonia, dominated by ethnic
Albanians, will be conducted again on December 5 because of
alleged voting irregularities, reports reaching here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the November 14 runoff of the presidential election,
opposition Social Democrats candidate Tito Petkovski was beaten by
center-right government candidate Boris Trajkovski by a margin of
some 75,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
The opposition party lodged complaints alleging irregularities
and fraud at polling stations in the mostly ethnic Albanian
regions.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, the country's electoral commission turned down
the party's claims, but the party immediately appealed to the
Supreme Court. The Court nullified the results in the 230 polling
stations, and the electoral commission selected a date for the
repeat election.
</P>
<P>
Some 160,000 people are eligible to vote in the disputed
districts. As most of them are ethnic Albanians, they will
probably vote for deputy foreign minister Trajkovski. It is
widely expected that the partial repeat election will not change
the outcome of the presidential election in this Balkan state.

<HEADLINE> Presidents of Visegrad Group Countries Hold Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Presidents of the four Visegrad
group countries held a summit in Gerlachov, Slovakia, on Friday
and agreed to play an active role in rebuilding southeast Europe,
while stressing that European security could not be divided, said
reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The four presidents, Rudolf Schuster of Slovakia, Vaclav Havel
of the Czech Republic, Aleksander Kwasniewski of Poland, and Goncz
Arpad of Hungary, said they believed that with the common goal of
returning to Europe, they need mutual support and concerted action.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary said
Slovakia's early entry into NATO and the EU would benefit the
prosperity and stability of central Europe and the whole continent.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, the four countries agreed to hold more than
one Visegrad summit annually at any needed time for the purpose of
strengthening mutual cooperation. The next summit will be held in
Poland.
</P>
<P>
The Visegrad group was formed as an organization of regional
cooperation in 1991 by Poland, Hungary and former Czechoslovakia
to strengthen their cooperation. Its members increased to four
after former Czechoslovakia divided into two countries in 1993.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, voices of strengthening cooperation became
stronger among the four countries. Senior official visits became
more frequent. Every year, the heads of the four countries hold a
summit and an informal "no tie" informal meeting.

<HEADLINE> China's Accession to WTO Accelerated, Shi Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEATTLE, December 3 (Xinhua) -- China's accession to the World
Trade Organization (WTO) has been accelerated during the third
ministerial meeting of the organization in Seattle, Shi Guangsheng,
Chinese Minister of the Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation,
said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a group of Chinese reporters, Shi, who came here to
attend the meeting on Monday, expressed his optimism over China's
eventual entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Shi met 16 U.S. senators, 29 U.S.
congressmen, leaders of farmers associations and prominent
businessmen. The agreement signed between China and the United
States last month on China's entry into the WTO was a major topic
during the meetings.
</P>
<P>
Shi said the politicians and businessmen told him that the U.S.-
China pact is a win-win agreement and will play not only a very
important role in developing the trade and economic relations
between the two countries, but also a historic role in stabilizing
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
They expressed their hope that the agreement will be
implemented and the U.S. Congress will approve the Normal Trade
Relations (NTR) status to China. They also expressed their
support for China's entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with 16 ministers from other countries and
European Union Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy, Shi said, "Those
countries which have not concluded negotiations on China's entry
into the WTO have indicated their desire to finish the talks as
soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese minister added that he and Lamy agreed that China
and the EU should resume their negotiations as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
China concluded negotiations with Canada late last month. Shi
said his country is closer to reaching agreement with another six
or seven countries during the meeting in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
On Taiwan's entry into the WTO, Shi reaffirmed that the
principles in the Chairman's Statement of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT) should be adhered to, that is to say,
China should join the WTO before Chinese Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Shi said Beijing will not dispute the entry of Chinese Taipei
as a separate custom zone into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with WTO Director-General Mike Moore, Shi
reaffirmed the position and Moore expressed his understanding and
support.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the chaos of the Seattle gathering caused by
the protests, Shi expressed his dissatisfaction. He had to cancel
some scheduled meetings on Tuesday due to the blockade by the
protesters.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, thousands of protesters occupied streets near the
Washington State Convention and Trade Center. The ministers and
delegates were stopped from entering the meeting by the protesters
and an opening ceremony had to be canceled.
</P>
<P>
"While some protesters enjoyed their freedom to block the roads,
the ministers were deprived of their freedom to move," Shi noted.
</P>
<P>
Many delegates and ministers made the similar complaint. Latin
American and Caribbean ministers signed a joint communique
expressing their anger at the United States for the violence
against some delegates by some protesters.
</P>
<P>
A Colombian delegate was held up and beaten by the protesters
when he tried to attend the meeting on Tuesday.

CARACAS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The second summit of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is scheduled
to be held in Caracas, capital of Venezuela, next summer,
Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel told a news
conference Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting had been planned in principle for March of next
year, but it will possibly be moved to April or May," Rangel said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the date and theme of the summit are yet to be
fixed by OPEC General Secretary Rilwanu Lukman, who will pay a
brief visit to Caracas on December 18.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which will be focused on stabilizing the changing
oil world market, had originally been scheduled three days after
the semiannual meeting of energy ministers of the cartel, also in
Caracas in March, when the group of 11 exporting countries would
decide whether to adjust production cuts that had taken the prices
to levels never seen in the last nine years.
</P>
<P>
Rangel said that one of the summit's main goals is to design a
permanent system to stabilize the market.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela is one of the five founding members of OPEC, set up
in September 1960.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Asks U.S. to Honor Migration Agreement, Return Cuban Boy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Referring to the U.S.-Cuba
incident related to the case of a five-year-old Cuban boy, top
Cuban legislator Ricardo Alarcon Friday urged the U.S. government
to respect the migration agreement signed between the two
countries in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the National Television, Alarcon,
president of the Cuban Popular Power National Assembly (Parliament)
, said that for a legal migration proceeding, the U.S. government
must comply with what has been established in previous agreements.
</P>
<P>
Elian Gonzalez, a five-year-old Cuban child, was the only
survivor of a boat which sank in Florida waters and took 14
illegal Cuban emigrants down with it on November 25.
</P>
<P>
The boy was found clinging to an inner tube in sea waters off
Miami, while his mother and his stepfather, who took him from Cuba
without the knowledge or permission of his natural father, had
both drowned.
</P>
<P>
Elian Gonzalez now remains on the U.S. territory, despite
requests by his father for his return.
</P>
<P>
Alarcon said that the rights of the boy's father have not been
respected as both Cuban and U.S. laws support parental authority
over minors.
</P>
<P>
Cuba and the United States will start a new round of talks on
December 13 to review compliance with the migration agreement and
other related issues.

<HEADLINE> Building Materials in Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 4 (Xinhua) -- China's building materials
industry is expected to rake in more profits this year, today's
China Daily quoted a senior industry official as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to the central government's policies to expand demand,
the country's building materials industry earned a net profit of 1.
57 billion yuan in the first ten months of the year," said Lei
Qianzhi, deputy director of the State Administration of Building
Materials Industry.
</P>
<P>
But, the industry suffered a loss before July, according to him.
</P>
<P>
"The industry is expected to earn 2 billion yuan in 1999," said
Lei.
</P>
<P>
The industry's value-added output amounted to 65.5 billion yuan
from January to October, up 11.6 percent from the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
The value-added output is expected to reach 87 billion yuan
this year, up 9.5 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
During the first ten months, cement output totaled 439 million
tons, up 12.8 percent from a year ago. Sheet glass output
amounted to 139 million crates, up 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The price for major building materials was a little bit higher
than that in 1998," noted Lei, adding that the exports of building
materials were on the rise.
</P>
<P>
China exported 1.84 billion U.S. dollars worth of building
materials in the first ten months of the year, up 4.5 percent from
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
High value-added products such as glass fiber and marble plates
continued to be major export items. These products were mainly
sold in Japan, the United States and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the progress, the overall situation of the building
materials industry was not optimistic," warned Lei, who explained
that the oversupply, irrational production mix and low profit
still hamper the further development of the industry.
</P>
<P>
According to him, China has closed cement and glass factories
with a total production capacity of 40 million tons and 15 million
crates in 1999 to improve the industry structure.
</P>
<P>
It will continue to close more small glass and cement factories
next year. The closure will help reduce an additional production
capacity of 50 million tons of cement and 15 million crates of
glass, according to Lei.
</P>
<P>
"China's possible accession to the World Trade Organization
will be a great challenge to domestic firms," he added.

<HEADLINE> Two Million Indonesians Addicted to Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- At least two million people in
Indonesia have been addicted to drug and 30 have died of overdose,
a local leading newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"At present, at least two million Indonesians have been
addicted to drug. Among them 1.3 million were Jakartans," the
Kompas daily reported, adding that 30 people have died of
overdose.
</P>
<P>
It also reported that at least 130,000 drug abusers in Jakarta
need special treatment.
</P>
<P>
"Most of them are teenagers. About 82 percent of them have
consumed (drug) intentionally," the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia was not a transit area, but had been a market
destination of the narcotics, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"Drug circulation in the country is controlled by an
international syndicate," police spokesman Brig. Gen. Erald
Dotulong was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Syndicate Cali of Columbia is allegedly involved in the
narcotics and psychotropics circulation in the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that the syndicate produced at least 955 to
1,150 tons of heroin in 1996 and the heroin products increased by
10 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
"40 to 50 kilograms of heroin are circulated in Indonesia per
month," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that the cocaine was supplied from
Columbia, while the heroin and morphine were supplied from the
gold-triangle through Bangkok, Thailand.
</P>
<P>
"The circulation have reached to district area," he added.

SEATTLE, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The third ministerial
conference of the World Trade Organization (WTO) entered into
overtime Friday as a battle between the United States and the
European Union over agriculture had tied up negotiators for almost
the whole day.
</P>
<P>
The organizing committee of the 135-member WTO ministerial
conference canceled a scheduled 6:30 p.m. closing news conference
by U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and WTO Director-
General Mike Moore.
</P>
<P>
Some delegates to the conference began to talk openly of the
possibility of failure as they sought agreement on contentious
issues to launch a new round of trade liberalization talks
beginning next year.
</P>
<P>
As the deadline passed, some delegates said they were preparing
to negotiate through the night for the second night running, while
others said the most likely outcome was failure.
</P>
<P>
A senior envoy from a developing country said, "In my 20 years
in this business, I've never known such a bad atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the evening, spokesman of both the European Union
and Canada expressed pessimism about whether the differences could
be bridged, complaining that the United States was demanding too
much in the area of reducing agriculture subsidies.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 4 (Xinhua)-- Thousands of people in the
troubled province of Aceh, Indonesia, sought refuge at mosques on
Friday ahead of the 23rd anniversary of the Free Aceh Movement
(GAM).
</P>
<P>
"The flow of the refugees starts from Thursday following the
shooting which claimed two lives of civilians. And about 3,500
residents from four villages in Samatiga district, West Aceh, keep
coming to seek refuge until late Friday," the Kompas daily
Saturday reported.
</P>
<P>
The anniversary of GAM is due to fall on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The daily also reported that most of Acehnese in Meulaboh,
capital of West Aceh regency, stopped their activities ahead of
the GAM commemoration.
</P>
<P>
"In Meulaboh all schools are closed, business activities
halted, and the main roads are so quiet and vehicles absolutely
are not seen. It is just like a dead city," the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Mosques in West Aceh were packed with refugees, the report
added.
</P>
<P>
"It looks like that refugees are so scared. They feel more
saver if they crowd around in one place," it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Aceh Governor Sjamsudin Mahmud and the provincial
police chief Bahrumsyah Kasman urged Acehnese to refrain and not
to be influenced by provocation.
</P>

They also urged Acehnese not to lower the Indonesian flag
during the GAM anniversary.
</P>
<P>
"Don't lower Indonesian flag of Merah Putih," the daily quoted
Mahmud as saying.

<P>
The daily also reported that at least 8,000 police had been
deployed to safeguard vital government installations in
anticipation that any possibilities may happen during the GAM
anniversary.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Port Bans Entry of Vehicles With Tinted Glasses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Motor vehicles with tinted
glasses have been banned in the protected area of southeastern
Bangladesh's Chittagong Port Area (CPA) to ensure security there.
</P>
<P>
"The entry of all vehicles with tinted glasses into the port
area is banned," a circular of the CPA was quoted as saying by a
report of The Bangladesh Observer newspaper on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Motor vehicles with tinted glasses are considered to be widely
used by miscreants for illegal activities, and security personnel
on duty are unable to see who are inside the vehicles as the
glasses are tinted, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"These vehicles are used by affluent veteran criminals in a bid
to avoid detection and to conduct various illegal activities in
the protected area of Chittagong," a senior security official
said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Department of the CPA took the remedial measure
following an spectacular increase in the incidents of theft,
pilferage and even extortion inside the port area, and members of
the armed forces have been stationed in the port area to maintain
law and order along with the port security staff and police,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
A section of unscrupulous people, who use cars with tinted
glass to make easy foray into the port area in the guise of
genuine port users, are also involved in illegal trafficking of
imported valuable goods out of the port, CPA Director (Security)
Lt. Colonel Amin Azim said.

He made the remarks at the 12th Governing Council Meeting of
the Center of Integrated Rural Development for Asia and the
Pacific (CIRDAP) held here Friday, official paper the New Light of
Myanmar reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Myanmar government has spent more than 17
billion kyats (56.6 million U.S. dollars) for the country's rural
development in the border areas in the last decade, constructing
more than 5,953.3 kilometers of roads, 101 bridges, 43 new
hospitals, 79 dispensaries and 43 rural health enters, 351
primary, 46 middle and 14 high schools.
</P>
<P>
The government also constructed 102 large, medium and small
dams and irrigation facilities all over the country in the
period, increasing the irrigated area by more than 603,405
hectares, he stated.
</P>
<P>
Poverty, low standard of living, lack of infrastructure,
inadequate economic and social facilities including education and
health facilities, and insufficiency of opportunities for
meaningful employment are some of the issues that all the CIRDAP
countries share, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
By assisting the national actions of member states, promoting
regional cooperation, providing necessary services including
research, training and information dissemination, CIRDAP has
proved to be of great benefit to all of us, he cited.
</P>
<P>
The goal of Myanmar government is to have equitable development
among the various regions of the nation, he said, adding that
Myanmar aspires to narrow the differences between the urban and
the rural areas as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
The CIRDAP, established in 1979 with its headquarters in Dhaka,
Bangladesh, is aimed at eradicating poverty in rural areas and
creating new job opportunities and enhancing economy and living
standard in the member countries.
</P>
<P>
CIRDAP member countries have a total population of 1.5 billion,
the majority of whom live in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar became the 12th member of the CIRDAP in 1995 which also
groups Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Iran,
Japan, Laos, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand
and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Shaanxi to Turn More Farmland into Forests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Shaanxi Province in northwest
China plans to turn one million ha of farmland into forests in the
coming 12 years to improve its ecological environment for
achieving the goal of sustainable economic development.
</P>
<P>
With the completion of the project which will involve an
investment of 20 billion yuan, Shaanxi's forest area will increase
by 2.93 million ha, and its forest coverage rate will be up from
present 28.8 percent to 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
By then, 97,900 square kilometers of land suffering from soil
erosion will be reclaimed.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, a farmer will get 100 kg of grain from the
State each year for turning every 0.07 hectares of farmland into
forest.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi's soil erosion land accounted for 50 percent of the
country's total. Each year, 920 million tons of sand is washed
into the country's two largest rivers, Yangtze and Yellow.
</P>
<P>
The deteriorating ecological environment caused by soil erosion
and desertification led to the frequent occurrence of disasters,
causing huge economic losses to Shaanxi.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five decades, the Chinese government had
implemented large scale forest construction projects in Shaanxi,
including the forest shelter project in north, northeast and
northwest China, a forest shelter project on the middle and upper
reaches of the Yangtze River, a soil erosion control project in
Yulin Prefecture and on the loess plateau.
</P>
<P>
By 1998, the province had reclaimed 70,000 square kilometers of
soil eroded land and planted more than 10 million ha of trees. It
had also set up 256,000 ha of nature reserves.

<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN December 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists recently
discovered an ancient well dating back to the Yuan Dynasty (1271-
1368) in Shilou County in north China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The well was discovered on a hill slope during the
reconstruction of a local water-conservancy project.
</P>
<P>
Covered by a slate, the well is about 70 cm in diameter and 182
meters deep. Carved on the bricks of the well mouth, are words
showing the year of the well's construction, and names of the
three workmen who built the well.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists pointed to three possibilities for the use of
the well as providing potable water source, storage or war trap.
</P>
<P>
The discovery will provide valuable clues for study on history
and social customs in the early Yuan Dynasty.

<HEADLINE> WTO Negotiations To End Without Agreement, Sources Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEATTLE, December 3 (Xinhua) -- The third ministerial
conference of World Trade Organization (WTO) will end late Friday
evening without achieving a detailed agenda for launching a new
round of trade negotiations beginning next year.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from Europe, Asia and Latin America in the Washington
State Convention and Trade Center said the United States and the
WTO would release a brief statement declaring an end to the
conference without an extensive communique.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, the conference entered into overtime as a
battle between the United States and the European Union over
agriculture had tied up negotiators for almost the whole day.
</P>
<P>
Organizing committee of the 135-member WTO ministerial
conference canceled a scheduled 6:30 p.m. closing news conference
by U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and WTO director-
general Mike Moore.
</P>
<P>
As the deadline passed, some delegates said they were preparing
to negotiate throughout the night for the second night running,
while others said the mostly outcome was failure.
</P>
<P>
A senior envoy from a developing country said, "In my 20 years
in this business, I've never known such a bad atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the evening, spokesman of both European Union and
Canada expressed pessimism about whether the differences could be
bridged, complaining that the United States was demanding too much
in the area of reducing agriculture subsidies.
</P>
<P>
The mission of the WTO conference in Seattle is to create a
prospering global economy, increasing the flow of goods and
services around the world.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from 135 WTO members are debating on the future
of the world trade inside the Washington State Convention and
Trade Center, and holding bilateral talks on related matters in
the nearby hotels. Everyone wants to get an advantage from the on-
going conference in Seattle.

<HEADLINE> China Allows Foreign Investors to Sponsor Hydro Stations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, December 4 (Xinhua) -- President of the U.S.-based Aes
Orient Inc. William Ruccius recently held discussions with
concerned departments of Qinghai Province on financing a
hydropower station on the upper reaches of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
The move indicated that the Chinese government has allowed
foreign investors to solely finance large and medium-sized
hydropower stations in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Aes TB Power Company Limited, which is jointly funded by
the Aes Orient Inc and the Hong Kong-based Truf Busy Group Limited,
has the intention to solely finance the Zhigangkala Hydropower
Station, which is to be located at the juncture of Jianzha and
Hualong counties.
</P>
<P>
The station will be the first medium-sized station solely
funded by a foreign investor and also the largest foreign-funded
project of Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
The station which will cost 1.4 billion yuan will have an
generating capacity of 192,000 kilowatts. It is only seven
kilometers away from the Lijiaxia Hydropower Station on the upper
reaches of the Yellow river.
</P>
<P>
The province's acting governor Zhao Leji said his government
will offer preferential policies for overseas investment in line
with the central government's move to develop central and western
parts of China during a meeting with William Ruccius.

<HEADLINE> Ozone Pact Good Example of Global Environmental Protection Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 4 (Xinhua) -- A senior United Nations
environmental protection official described the Montreal Protocol
on Substances that Deplete Ozone Layer as a good example of global
efforts to solve international environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
Shafqat Kakakhel, deputy executive director of the United
Nations Environment Program (UNDP), said in an interview with
xinhua during an ongoing ozone layer forum earlier this week that
he fully agreed that the protocol is the most successful
international agreement on environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Global consumption of ozone-depleting substances (ODS) has
dropped by 85 percent during the past 10 years thanks to the
joint efforts by signatories to the Montreal pact, involving about
170 countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ozone layer shields the Earth from the Sun's harmful
radiation, but chlorine and bromine compounds released by CFCs and
halons used in refrigerators have depleted part of it, causing
troubles for humans including skin cancer and cataracts.
</P>
<P>
The Montreal Protocol was worked out in 1987 to protect the
ozone layer by phasing out ODS like CFCs and halons by 2010.
</P>
<P>
"The industrialized countries now consume less than 15,000 tons
of ODS, a big reduction from a million tons in 1989. The
developing countries have almost the same consumption level now as
in 1989, even though they are allowed to increase their
consumption without a limit just to meet their basic domestic
requirements."
</P>
<P>
The Multilateral Fund, set up under the pact with funding from
developed countries, has successfully assisted over 110 developing
countries with approximately one billion U.S. dollars in the past
nine years, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the fund's Executive Committee concluded agreements
earlier this year with governments of China and India for phasing
out their CFC production capacity over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Brazil has announced the closure of their CFCs production
facilities and last year Russia also agreed to shut down its CFC
production units, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kakakhel, who is in Beijing for the 11th Meeting of the
Parties to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete Ozone
Layer, said the world is indeed looking for similar fomulas to
solve the other global environmental problems such as climate
change, loss of bio-diversity and desertification.

<HEADLINE> Zhongguancun to Be Built Into Leading Science Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 4 (Xinhua) -- "We're trying to build
Zhongguancun into one of the world's leading science parks, a hot
cake for both capital and human talents in 10 years," said Ren
Ranqi, deputy director of the Administrative Committee of the
Zhongguancun Science Park in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Established by the Beijing Municipal Government in 1997, the
Committee is committed to serving the 6,000 hi-tech companies in
Zhongguancun and the new ones to be set up in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
Ren believed a fine environment is vital to attracting capital
and talents. "Environment is productive," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of software, a system encouraging industrialization
of high technology is important. We're persuading the government
to give us more privileges such as those for Shenzhen and Shanghai,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Technology should integrate with capital. We're now
trying to attract risk capital."
</P>
<P>
A guarantee fund for risk capital have been set up in
Zhongguancun and risk capital is expected to be the best means to
support the application of technology in economic development.
</P>
<P>
As for "hardware environment", the deputy director said Beijing
is now working on improving infrastructures in the Zhongguancun
area, including several new roads and a railway line.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We're trying to make life here comfortable and
convenient. When their needs are met, the talents are sure to stay.
"
</P>
<P>
He also expected to attract overseas Chinese to work in
Zhongguancun.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the recent Sino-U.S. WTO accord, the deputy
director said opportunities would be far more than challenges, and
it would speed construction of the Zhongguancun Science Park.

<HEADLINE> Residents Told to Collect Used Dry Batteries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese citizens are told to
collect and recycle depleted dry batteries in a bid to improve the
environment.
</P>
<P>
Used batteries, now a major source of pollution, are piling up
in their billions each year across China and have mostly been
dumped as garbage in this country. Their dangerous contents have
leaked into surrounding air, soil and waters, said experts.
</P>
<P>
The recycling of waste batteries has been eclipsed in the
country since the "cultural revolution" (1966-76), said Zhou
Zhongfan, a senior engineer with the Chinese Research Institute of
Environmental Sciences, in an interview with "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
Last year, 14 billion batteries were used in China, only a
small fraction were retrieved through spontaneous public efforts,
said information from the State Environmental Protection
Administration (SEPA).
</P>
<P>
"A large quantity of mercury, cadmium, lead and other
pernicious materials from these waste batteries was released into
the surrounding environment, which gravely threatens public health
and ecology," said Zhou.
</P>
<P>
Even the small amount of retrieved batteries have not been
properly recycled to make them harmless and reusable, said the
engineer.
</P>
<P>
In China, the job of collecting waste batteries is handled by
private businessmen. There is no nationwide recycling network. So
more retrieval stations should be established to recycle depleted
batteries, Zhou suggested.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, there are now 300 garbage battery retrieving
stations. This year, the city plans to retrieve some 300,000 tons
of waste batteries, said an official with the Beijing Garbage
Recycling Center of the Municipal Sanitation Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Each batch of waste batteries to be retrieved is so small that
factories have a tough time using normal recycling means, the
official complained.
</P>
<P>
Each year, about 13,000 to 14,000 tons of zinc, or 13 percent
of the country's total zinc output, are used in producing dry
batteries. And the country can recover some 40,000 tons of zinc
through recycling depleted batteries.
</P>
<P>
There are 300 small battery factories in the country. They
waste resources, and could cause harmful pollution without
producing enough to justify their existence.
</P>
<P>
To enhance public awareness of this issue, SEPA is currently
drafting a governmental regulation to standardize the production,
distribution, transportation and disposal of waste batteries.
</P>
<P>
"Battery producers, consumers, and even the whole society
should share the responsibility of retrieving and recycling waste
batteries, instead of depending only on government orders," Zhou
added.
</P>
<P>
Since October, Beijing families have begun paying a sanitation
fee of three yuan per month to help the city's garbage recycling
drive.

<P>
CHENGDU, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Sichuan Province in southwest
China has applied to have its Qingcheng-Mountain-Dujiangyan scenic
spot, 70 kilometers northwest of the provincial capital of Chengdu,
included on UNESCO's World Heritage List.
</P>
<P>
The application has been approved by the State Council and
China's National Commission for UNESCO (United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization). The 5,4700-ha scenic spot
is a state-level tourist site that is under state protection.
</P>
<P>
Qingcheng Mountain is one of the country's four famous Taoist
mountains and 2,250-year-old Dujiangyan neighboring the mountain
is the world's oldest functioning irrigation project, which still
irrigates some 660,000 hectares of farmland.
</P>
<P>
To ensure a success for the application, the Ministry of
Construction and the provincial government of Sichuan have jointly
organized a group of experts to map out an environment protection
and administration plan for the site.
</P>
<P>
Since China joined UNESCO in protecting world culture and
natural heritage 14 years ago, some 22 scenic sites and cultural
centers have been included on the World Heritage List, ranking
tenth in the world. They include the Great Wall, the Palace Museum,
the terra cotta warriors of the First Emperor of the Qin Dynasty,
and the Huangshan Mountain.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Orders to Probe Student Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi has directed the immediate formation of a joint commission to
probe the frequent student riots in public universities.
</P>
<P>
The commission to be comprised of professionals has been given
four months to finalize its work and present its report to
President Moi, the Kenya Times newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"I'm concerned about the frequent riots at the state
universities which disrupted academic programs and led to
destruction of property worth millions of shillings," Moi told a
graduation ceremony at Moi University in central Kenya Friday.
</P>
<P>
There were five university student riots in the past month, in
which students stoned the passing-by cars, burned kiosks and
looted shops. The riots also led to university closures
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
Such acts of violence by students reflected bad politics,
intolerable moral decay and drug abuse in Kenya's society, Moi
said.
</P>
<P>
Rioting had become part of university culture, the president
noted, adding that students are free to air their grievances
peacefully instead of resorting to violence in order to be heard.

<HEADLINE> Thai Oil Refinery Fire Put Out, Five Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The fire at one of Thailand's
biggest oil refineries has been put out Saturday morning before it
claimed five lives and caused millions of baht of losses.
</P>
<P>
Firemen found one more body earlier Saturday at Thai Oil Co.
Ltd.'s refinery complex in Si Racha in the eastern province of
Chonburi, where an explosion late Thursday night and a fire
afterward had already killed four people.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 others were injured and had been taken to
hospital, Channel 9, the state television station, reported here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The blaze raged on for about 35 hours before a large quantity
of chemical foam was sprayed on four burning oil storage tanks in
the complex.
</P>
<P>
A Thai army plane shipped back 52,000 liters of foam from
Singapore Saturday morning, which was used to put out the fire.
</P>
<P>
Four oil storage tanks were completely burned down along with
more than 30 million liters of gasoline in them, causing the
220,000-barrel-a-day refinery some 500 million baht (12.9 million
U.S. dollars) losses.
</P>
<P>
Thai Oil has shut down the refinery indefinitely. Repairs to
the refinery would take seven to eight months, the company said.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the explosion is not yet known.
</P>
<P>
Officials expected limited environmental damage to the area
since a northeasterly wind has carried the thick black smoke and
fumes out to the sea.

<HEADLINE> Power Rationing to Continue in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Power rationing will continue
because the recent heavy rains have not raised water levels at
Kenya's hydro- electric power generation stations, the Kenya Power
and Lighting Company (KPLC) has said.
</P>
<P>
The water had been seriously depleted and a few days of
downpour would not significantly change the water levels, KPLC
spokesman Tony Sittoni said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The rationing would continue until consumers get an official
notice from the company, Saturday's East African Standard
newspaper quoted Sittoni as saying. .
</P>
<P>
Power rationing in the east African country has badly hampered
its industrial sector and caused inconvenience in people's daily
life in the past several months. It also scared off the potential
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kenya Association of Manufacturers has appealed to
the KPLC to ease power rationing by December 6 this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEATTLE, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Ministers from 135 members of
the World Trade Organization (WTO) Friday failed to launch a new
round of global trade talks as the third ministerial meeting of
the organization closed here.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the final plenary session of the meeting, U.S.
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, chairperson of the
meeting, announced that trade representatives of the WTO will
continue their negotiations in Geneva starting January 1, 2000 in
an aim to launch a new round.
</P>
<P>
"We don't lose the work, we got a built-in agenda, and we got
the mandate to continue doing some of this work," Mike Moore,
director-general of the WTO, told the 10-minute session.
</P>
<P>
The meeting even failed to issue a brief statement. Diplomats
say the failure is a heavy blow to WTO, which was set up five
years ago, as well as an embarrassment to the United States, which
hosted the conference.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the opening of the meeting, Barshefsky said failure is
not an option, saying she was confident that the meeting will
succeed and a new round will be launched.
</P>
<P>
Reasons leading to the failure include heavy controversies over
the agriculture between the European Union and the U.S., and
differences between the developed countries and developing
countries over a wide range of issues.
</P>
<P>
The meeting has been overshadowed by protests outside the
meeting. Thousands of protesters gathered each day in downtown
Seattle to protest against the meeting. An opening session has to
be canceled on November 30.
</P>
<P>
A Costa Rican diplomat told Xinhua that the big losers of the
failure are developing countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The South African National
Council Against Smoking has welcomed the draft tobacco regulations
published in the Government Gazette, according to South African
Press Associated reports.
</P>
<P>
"The draft regulations are a necessary, appropriate and
opportune response to a major public health hazard which kills
four million people worldwide every year," the council said in a
statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The industry's ability to recruit youngsters to smoking
through the promotion of pop concerts and sports should be ended
as soon as possible," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
South African Health Ministry noted that an estimated 25,000
South Africans die annually of diseases attributed to smoking.
Smokers lose about 12 years of their lives through the habit.
</P>
<P>
"These deaths are unnecessary and could be prevented, if people
can stop smoking and adopt healthy life styles," the minister said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that most children whose parents smoke, are
found to suffer from asthma, emphysema and pneumonia at an early
age. These diseases could reduce their life expectancy.
</P>
<P>
The National Cancer Registry also estimated that two million of
the 19 million children in South Africa would die prematurely from
diseases related to smoking.
</P>
<P>
Studies indicated an alarming increase of smoking among young
children, a habit encouraged by tobacco advertising and sport
sponsorships.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa has directed the Tanzanian Revenue Authority to
provide to the public special free telephone numbers on which
people can give names of suspected tax evaders.
</P>
<P>
The phone numbers should be publicized through newspapers,
radio and television possibly daily so that the public could help
in pinpointing the evaders, Mkapa said in the central town of
Dodoma Friday.
</P>
<P>
People volunteering information on the evaders should not be
forced to give their identities, the Daily News Saturday quoted
the president as saying.
</P>
<P>
Some business people are still evading paying due taxes, Mkapa
said, noting that the evaders are simply thieves denying the state
its capacity to serve its people.
</P>
<P>
These people are contributing to the lack of adequate medicines
in hospitals, denying the state its capacity to employ teachers
and repair roads, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said that these tax evaders degrade the country's
integrity by forcing the nation to be dependent unnecessarily.
</P>
<P>
The president cautioned Tanzanians against such elements,
saying that they should not be given a chance to destroy the
country's peace foundations laid by late founding president Julius
Nyerere.

MUSCAT, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Top Chinese legislator Li Peng
on Saturday left here for home after winding up his four-day
official goodwill visit to Oman, the last leg of his tour to six
African and Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
Before Li left, Omani State Council President Hamoud Al-Harthy
called on Li in Li's hotel suite to bid farewell.
</P>
<P>
He told Li, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress of China, that his visit was successful.
</P>
<P>
Al-Harthy also expressed his appreciation of China's Middle
East policy, calling it "wise" and "correct."

He said he hopes China will play a bigger role in the Middle
East peace process and in the safeguarding of peace and stability
in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Upon leaving Muscat, Li sent a message to Al-Harthy, expressing
his thanks for the warm reception he was given while staying in
Oman.
</P>
<P>
Li said that during his visit, he held friendly talks with
Al-Harthy and met Deputy Prime Minister Fahd bin Mahmoud and
other leaders of the Arab nation.
</P>
<P>
Li said the two sides had an in-depth exchange of views on
bilateral cooperation and other international issues of common
concern.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed his belief that his visit has deepened the mutual
understanding and friendship between the Chinese and the Omani
peoples and between the National People's Congress of China and
the State Council of Oman.
</P>
<P>
The visit will contribute to the further development of
friendly relations of cooperation between the two countries, Li
said.

NAIROBI, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Two Pakistanis have been
sentenced by Kenya's court to 10 years in jail for being found in
possesion of heroin valued at 13 million shillings (about 174,000
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The two Pakistanis and one Kenyan accomplice were also ordered
Friday to pay a fine of 39 million shillings (about 522,000

the Daily Nation newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The accused were first charged in October last year, together
with four others, after they were arrested at the Jomo Kenyatta
International Airport in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has reportedly taken some emergency
measures to curb drug trafficking and abuse, which is a serious
social problem in the east African country.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 110 Cars Impounded in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- A total of 110 cars suspected
to have been stolen from Zambia's neighboring countries have been
impounded in the past week by Zambian police in conjunction with
the International Police (Interpol).
</P>
<P>
Home Affairs Minister Peter Machungwa told parliament Friday
that "a team of investigators is actively investigating each
impounded motor vehicle to verify the status of each motor
vehicle."
</P>
<P>
The bona fide owners of the cars should not worry as their cars
would be returned to them after verification, Times of Zambia
newspaper Saturday quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
The exercise has since 1997 involved police officers from South
Africa, Mozambique, Malawi, Botswana, Tanzania, Lesotho and
Swaziland under the auspices of the Southern African Regional
Police Chiefs Cooperation Organization.
</P>
<P>
Machungwa said that criminals are becoming sophisticated with
some using the vast bush of Zambia's borders with its neighboring
countries to smuggle stolen cars.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian minister said that police has a constitutional
right to trace and confiscate property suspected to have been
stolen and apprehend perpetrators of such crimes. Zambia will not
be used as a haven for crime, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Machungwa urged vehicle buyers to clear cars through right
channels of Interpol in Lusaka as there are forged Interpol
certificates on clearance of motor vehicles being used by
tricksters.

JAKARTA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's net foreign

billion dollars in the week ending November 30 from 16.5 billion

<HEADLINE> Indictment of Pak Ex-PM Put Off Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The indictment of deposed
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and six other accused in a
plane hijacking case was put off till December 8.
</P>
<P>
Judge of Anti-Terrorism Court No. 1 Rehmat Hussain Jafri
Saturday accepted the prosecution's plea that after amendment to
the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) 1997, it needs more time to prepare
the chargelist against Sharif and others.
</P>
<P>
This was the second postponement of the indictment, which had
earlier been put off from November 26 to December 4.
</P>
<P>
On the arrival of Sharif and others, leaders and activists of
Pakistan Muslim League, the former ruling party headed by the
deposed prime minister, staged a noisy protest and raised a slogan
in favor of Sharif.
</P>
<P>
The former prime minister, who was accused of attempted murder,
hijacking and criminal conspiracy, Saturday termed the amendment
to Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 as mala fide.
</P>
<P>
The military government, which assumed power after a coup on
October 12, wants to appoint its hand-picked judge to preside over
the hijacking case, he said.
</P>
<P>
The military government amended the act three days ago,
extending the anti-terrorism courts' jurisdiction to cases of
"waging war or attempting to wage war against Pakistan" and
hijacking as well as a number of other offenses.

JAKARTA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Three people were wounded by
gunshots and four others injured after falling from a truck
Saturday in Sigli, Indonesia's Aceh province, as hundreds of
separatists drove through the town to mark the anniversary of the
Free Aceh Movement.
</P>
<P>
"The injured victims are under intensive care in Sigli
hospital," Antara News Agency quoted a source at the hospital as
saying.
</P>
<P>
It was the first incident reported during the celebration of
the 23rd anniversary of the movement. Earlier, some rumors said
clashes between the separatists and the military may have occurred
in the province during the celebration.
</P>
<P>
Antara reported Saturday from the spot that hundreds of people
in trucks and on motorcycles were stopped by security personnel in
front of the Pidie Military Command in the morning and gunshots

<HEADLINE> Iraq Rejects U.N. Extension of Oil-for-Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 4 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi foreign ministry
spokesman announced on Saturday that Iraq rejected the
U.N. Security Council resolution 1280 on extending for one week
the mandate of the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council Friday night adopted Resolution 1280
as a stopgap to extend the sixth phase of the U.N. oil-for-food
program in Iraq for an additional week until December 11.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was quoted by the Iraqi News Agency as saying
that "once again America and its ally Britain substantiated their
gross disregard of all global concepts and norms and their
despisement of other Security Council members, even the permanent
ones."
</P>
<P>
He said that the oil-for-food program was supposed to improve
the humanitarian condition of the Iraqi people, but it has been
used for purposes that have nothing to do with the declared
objectives, but for purposes designed to harm the interests of the
Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
"The best evidence on this is the contracts that have been put
on hold by the U.N. Sanctions Committee, totalled 733 contracts
until last week with an estimated value of 1 billion dollars
more," said the spokesman, stressing that the U.S. and Britain
were behind the obstruction of Iraqi contracts.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. and Britain want to build more pressure on other
Security Council permanent members to drag them for passing the
ill-fated British draft resolution," he added.
</P>
<P>
The British proposal recommends a conditional suspension of
the sanctions after Iraq agrees to allow U.N. weapons inspectors
to resume their work in the country and cooperate with them, and
put its oil revenues under the U.N. control.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has repeatedly rejected the proposal, arguing that it
does not lead to the lifting, or even the suspension of the
sanctions, but adds new conditions and restrictions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It was "impractical and illogical" to extend mandate of this
program for only one week.
</P>
<P>
"This Anglo-American practice will be a precedent in the
history of the Security Council and it is desirable as an example
for practice of hegemony and disregard of the international
community," he warned.
</P>
<P>
The sixth phase of the program, which started on May 25,
expired on November 20. On November 19, the Security Council
adopted resolution 1275 to extend the program for two weeks until
December 4, which was turned down by Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food program, Iraq is allowed to sell a
limited amount of oil every six months to buy food, medicine and
other humanitarian supplies to the Iraqi people under crippling
U.N. sanctions on the country since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh PM Asks Asian Parliaments to Base Secretariat in Dhaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina Saturday proposed that a permanent secretariat of the
newly-established Association of Asian Parliaments for Peace
(AAPP) be set up in the country's capital, Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
"If the executive council recommends the establishment of a
permanent secretariat for the association, we in Bangladesh shall
be more than happy to host it," she said at the first executive
council meeting of the AAPP, which was formally launched in
September this year.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, who is also president of the association,
called upon AAPP members to renew their commitment to peace and to
pledge full support, both material and financial, for its full
functioning.
</P>
<P>
She said that in the AAPP, "we see a holistic approach to peace
that will involve parliamentarians and civil society
representatives from across the (Asian) continent to promote
understanding and spearhead prevention, mediation and resolutions
of conflicts."
</P>
<P>
Hasina urged AAPP members to consider the human and financial
implications and the organizational setup of the association for
implementing the proposed set of activities, such as formulating
an Asian Charter of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
"We need peace in Asia to ensure the welfare of more than half
of the world's population," she said. "We have untapped resources,
we have determination, we have love for the people, especially the
poor, we cannot fail to attain and promote peace and we must not."
</P>
<P>
Cambodian National Assembly President Prince Norodom Ranariddh,
who is also vice-president of the AAPP, said the Cambodian
government pledged full support for the next AAPP conference,
which is to be hosted by Cambodia in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia believed that the AAPP would be the most important
leadership forum for peace and democracy in Asia for the next
millennium, he said.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the next conference focus on developing
practical strategies for building a sustainable peace not only in
Asia but also in the world.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan,
South Korea, Russia and Palestine and host Bangladesh attended the
one-day executive council meeting of the AAPP, which has around 30
members.

MANILA, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
taking steps to keep commodity prices at reasonable levels this
Christmas season, President Joseph Estrada said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a radio program, Estrada said he has already directed the
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to monitor closely the
market prices of basic commodities and run after erring traders
and profiteers.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he is forming a committee to look for ways to
bring agricultural produce directly from farmers to consumers so
the government could "eliminate" middlemen who reap windfall
profits by buying the goods from producers and then selling them
to retailers and consumers.
</P>
<P>
"The traders or middlemen are the ones earning windfall
profits. Worse, many of these middlemen are not even paying the
correct taxes," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are studying closely how we can deliver goods directly from
the farmers to the consumers," he added.

<HEADLINE> Price Uncertainty Causes More Panic-buying Among </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Panic-buying is increasing among
 Zimbabwean consumers who have become uncertain of commodity price
 fluctuations caused by the prevailing high inflation of more than
70 percent, the Zimbabwe Economic Society said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The society said in its latest bi-monthly newsletter that
business units are indexing prices of goods and services on the
basis of the year-on-year inflation rate, thereby fueling further
inflation increases.
</P>
<P>
Inflation in Zimbabwe had been caused by the budget deficit and
rapid growth in bank credit, structural deficiencies of the
economy and the rapid fall of the Zimbabwean dollar, the
newsletter said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no consensus as to what causes inflation in Zimbabwe
which has a cost push effect on prices of goods," it said.
</P>
<P>
The economic society outlined that the emergence of
monopolistic market conditions in the country had also been linked
to inflation as firms restrict output to force prices up.

<HEADLINE> Calls to Further Protect Ozone Layer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 4 (Xinhua) -- More than 120 countries have
appealed in a joint declaration for more effective action in
protecting the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Declaration has urged developed countries to
fulfill their international obligations under the Vienna
Convention and the Montreal Protocol by providing developing
countries with financial support and the technology to protect the
ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
The declaration was passed in Beijing late last night at the
11th Meeting of the Montreal Protocol by representatives from 123
countries. Getting rid of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and ODCs
needs to be urgently addressed amid growing ozone holes in the
earth's atmosphere. The international community decided in 1987 in
the Montreal Protocol to eliminate CFCs and ODCs by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The pact said that developed countries "have largely ceased
the production and consumption of CFCs from January 1, 1996",
while the developing countries "committed themselves to freezing
their production and consumption of CFCs at the average level of
the period 1995-1997, from July 1, 1999".
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenhua, director of China's Environmental Protection
Administration, said today that an extra 475.7 million U.S.
dollars will be raised for the Multilateral Fund to help poor
countries fulfill their ozone protection obligations.

<HEADLINE> Namibia's Ruling Party Far Ahead in Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The Namibian ruling South
West African People's Organization (SWAPO) and incumbent President
Sam Nujoma appeared to retain an even stronger grip on government
as indicated by 76 percent of the votes counted by Friday.
</P>
<P>
Election officials said 349,106 votes had been counted,
information from Windhoek said Saturday. Final results are said to
be announced Sunday.
</P>
<P>
SWAPO, which led Namibia's 23-year-long struggle for
independence from apartheid South Africa and has ruled since 1989,
appears to have improved its standing over the 72.7 percent it
took in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The official opposition Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, which
took 20 percent in the 1994 elections, has taken only 10 percent
so far in this year's election, as the votes were shared by a
strong new opposition party, the Congress of Democrats which took
nine percent of the vote so far.
</P>
<P>
Of the other five parties contesting the poll, only the United
Democratic Front looked like it would claim a token presence in
the 72-seat National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Two days of voting ended Wednesday in this southwest African
country with the size of Britain and France combined.
</P>
<P>
A controversial constitutional amendment allows 70-year-old
Nujoma to serve a third five-year term.

HARARE, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Various youth associations in
Zimbabwe have formed an umbrella body aiming to coordinate their
activities and reverse economic problems facing the young people,
a youth leader said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The new organization to be known as Zimbabwe Foundation for All

The organization was formed during a three-day national
workshop on building the nation through sustainably youth
development in Bulawayo, the country's second largest city.
</P>
<P>
"As youths we have discovered that lack of information,
expertise and unity are some of the reasons that have made us fail
to access bank loans to finance our projects," Sibanda.
</P>
<P>
"So we need to mobilize and organize youth organizations to
find solutions to the numerous problems facing us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sibanda added that his organization will set up structures

<HEADLINE> Algerian President Bars Harkis from Returning Homeland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Algerian President Abdelaziz
Bouteflika refused harkis, the Algerian soldiers who fought on the
side of France during the War of Independence of Algeria from 1954
to 1962, to return to Algeria, Bouteflika was quoted as saying on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview by the Figaro Magazine, Bouteflika said that
the harkis have chosen to stay in France since 1954, so Algeria is
no longer their country.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the harkis are "a French problem," he also
criticized the policy of the French government toward the harkis,
who he said are living in "ghetto".
</P>
<P>
"I don't have the impression that the policy of the ghetto in
which they (harkis) are confined supports whatever policy of
integration in the past, the present and the future," said
Bouteflika.
</P>
<P>
The French government has been boasting its policy of "
integrating" Algerians, blacks and other immigrants, but most of
them still live in their separate zones in Paris and other major
French cities, especially in the "banlieus", or suburbs.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Government to Withdraw Army From Unrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

LAGOS, December 3 (Xinhua) -- Solders deployed in Nigeria's
Bayelsa State in the wake of the gruesome murder of 12 policemen
in the area by yet unidentified militant youth have started
withdrawing on the order of the Federal Government, Defense
Minister Theophilus Danjuma said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Already, our troops deployed in Bayelsa have started
withdrawing on orders of the government. This is the way it should
be," the Guardian newspaper Saturday quoted the defense minister
as saying.
</P>
<P>
"When ordered by the government, we (soldiers) should intervene
as necessary and withdraw promptly when the desired results have
been achieved," Danjuma said, adding that the military should not
take sides in any conflict.
</P>
<P>
While noting the danger which unrest in some parts of the
country pose to Nigeria's nascent democracy, the minister said the
recent serious violations of the internal security system in the
country necessitated a lot of vigilance on all military personnel.
</P>
<P>
Various groups and individuals have criticized the government
for deploying the troops in the town since early last month.
</P>
<P>
But the soldiers' mandate was to arrest the erring youths that
killed the policemen, military sources said..
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government even threatened to impose a state of
emergency on Odi and other trouble spots in the state.

Zhang Guoguang, the governor of Liaoning, organized an
emergency meeting on November 26 and immediately adopted necessary
prevention measures.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Defense Ties With Others </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran's defense relations with
other countries are "fully transparent" and based on
internationally accepted principles, said an Iranian Defense
Ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Keyvan Khosrawi made the statement on Thursday in response to
recent remarks by U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen, who
called on developed countries to confine their defense and
diplomatic relations with Iran, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Khosrawi said that such words by U.S. officials, which were
viewed as blatant interference in the internal affairs of
independent countries, would not be welcomed as in the past.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. has failed in its attempts to confine
Iran's normal ties with other countries and this has proved the
success of Iran's detente policy at international arena.
</P>
<P>
Iran, while rejecting any attempt for the production,
proliferation and stockpiling of unconventional arms, is entitled
to all internationally recognized rights within the framework of
preserving its national security and developing the state's
deterrent capabilities, he said.
</P>
<P>
He termed the final approval of Iran's proposed resolution on
missile weapons by the U.N. General Assembly recently as another
success for Iran in introducing a comprehensive and
indiscriminative attitude related to missile weapons at global
level.
</P>
<P>
U.N. member countries welcomed the approval of the resolution
and this shows that the international community opposes to
employing the issue of missile weapons as a lever by a limited
number of countries to impose political pressure on independent
states, he added.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Foreign Policy Based on Detente: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi stated here on Saturday that the foreign policy of the
government of President Mohammad Khatami is based on the two
principles of detente and "dialog among civilizations."
</P>
<P>
All Iranian officials, including the supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei, have consensus over these two principles, Kharrazi
told the inaugural session of the conference on heritage of
ancient civilizations held by experts from Iran, Egypt, Greece
and Italy.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran is sincerely pursuing its policy of
minimizing and ultimately removing tension, and at the same time
it is following institutionalization of dialog, understanding,
consensus and cooperation among nations and cultures, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Dialog is not a selection, but an urgency, Kharrazi underlined,
adding that profound, precise and intellectual dialog of cultures
and civilizations can find just, humanitarian and academic
solutions to the most serious problems of the world.
</P>
<P>
To this end, dialog can set a prelude to peace, security,
development and justice, he said, governments, international
agencies and non-governmental organizations initiated various
efforts for the realization of the idea of dialog among
civilizations .
</P>
<P>
The U.N. General Assembly has designated the year of 2001
as "the year of dialog among civilizations" on a proposal
raised by President Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister said that in case the dialog is
based on reason, wisdom and tolerance, the result would be
consolidation of pillars of freedom, justice, human rights and
civic development both at national and international levels.
</P>
<P>
All through history the Iranian people have preserved their
interest in cultural exchanges with the outside world, he said, in
the continuation of such a historical tradition and in line with
realization of religious ideals and beliefs of the Iranians, Iran
is now the harbinger of dialog of civilizations and cultures.

<HEADLINE> Beckenbauer Appeals for Chinese Support for World Cup Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, Decemeber 4 (Xinhua) -- German soccer legend Franz
Beckenbauer urged China here on Saturday to support his country's
bid to host the 2006 World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Beckenbauer, who heads the German bidding committee, was on a
two-day visit to China as part of his Asian tour which had seen
him trotting around New Zealand, Thailand and South Korea to drum
up support for his country's bid.
</P>
<P>
He flies to Japan on sunday for the 2002 World Cup qualifying
draw.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident we will beat other contenders, including
England, to win the host rights of the 2006 World Cup," he said in
a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Beckenbauer said Germany has caught up with long-time major
rivals--on and off the field--in the bidding race.
</P>
<P>
"I must admit that England launched an publication offensive
earlier than ours," he said. "But now we have caught up, we have a
lot of friends over the world and we are visiting them to win
their support."
</P>
<P>
Wang Junsheng, vice-president of the Chinese Football
Association, held talks on Saturday with the former German star
and one of the all-time greats in soccer history.
</P>
<P>
Beckenbauer, a key member of the West German team who won the
1974 World Cup on their home soil, tasted the same glory in Italy'
90, this time as a head coach.
</P>
<P>
Bringing the 2006 World Cup to Germany will culminate his life-
long love affair with soccer, he said.
</P>
<P>
Germany are competing with four other countries -- Egland,
Morocco, South Africa and Brazil -- for the hosting rights, with
England and South Africa considered as their main rivals.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
SANA -- The unemployment rate has hit 14 percent in the Arab
countries which means that more than 12.5 million people are
jobless, according to latest estimates by the Arab Labor
Organization (ALO).
</P>
<P>
The governments of Arab countries are urged to draw up policies
and programs and allocate at least 62.5 billion U.S. dollars to
deal with the unemployment problem.
</P>
<P>
Each job opportunity costs some 5,000 dollars, according to
economic studies.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, the labor force in Arab countries was put
at 85 million with a growth rate of 3.5 percent annually. The ALO
attributed the rise to a growing number of youngsters and women
going to the labor market.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Last minute differences aborted the signing of an
accord between Jordan and Iraq on oil supplies by Iraq to Jordan
in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will resume their contacts on the accord
later this month or early next January, Al-Hayat daily Saturday
quoted an informed sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
After three-day talks, Jordan and Iraq reached Thursday evening
an accord under which Iraq would supply Jordan with oil and
petro-products worth 500 million U.S. dollars in the year
2000. Half of the oil and products would be provided at
preferential prices.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, Iraq would also offer Jordan free-of-charge
oil ranging in value between 200 and 250 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
No information was available on the set price per metric ton.
</P>
<P>
SANA -- Renewable water resources in Yemen are estimated at
2.5 billion cubic meters per year, said an official of the Yemeni
Water Resources General Authority.
</P>
<P>
The country's population has reached 18 million and the per
capita water consumption in Yemen stands at 140 cubic meters per
annum.
</P>
<P>
Irrigation relies increasingly on subterranean water besides
the surface water, the official added.
</P>
<P>
Water demand will reach 3.42 billion cubic meters in 2005 which
means that the gap between supply and demand will hit 920 million
cubic meters. The official predicted a water crisis in some
provinces such as Sana, Taiz and Hudaydah.

<HEADLINE> Hundred Percent Success Rate in Launching China's "Long March" Rocket Carriers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 4 (Xinhua) -- China has launched 17 of its "
Long March" rocket carriers since 1997 with a hundred per cent
success rate.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Li Jianzhong, head of the China
Rocket Carrier Technology Institute said China had two abortive
launches of its Long March rocket carriers in 1996 which affected
its reputation of successful launching of its rocket carriers.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the Institute later introduced a number of strict
quality control measures in designing the rocket carriers. In
November, China made a successful launch of its first unmanned
spacecraft "Shenzhou".
</P>
<P>
The capsule of "Shenzhou" landed in the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region on November 21 at 3:41 a.m., after a space
voyage of 21 full hours. The rocket carrier of the spacecraft was
a Long March-2F designed by the Institute. Sophisticated systems,
including failure prediction and failure-safe systems, on board of
the rocket carries ensured successful launches.

WASHINGTON, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Trade ministers from around the world Friday night broke off
efforts to launch a new round of global trade negotiations, after
failing to reach agreement on a wide range of issues, including
farm subsidies, protection against illegally priced imports and
labor rights in the world trading system.
</P>
<P>
-- More than two years after the election of a new Iranian
president raised hopes of a thaw between Washington and Tehran,the
Clinton administration has reluctantly concluded that Iran is
increasing the flow of arms and money to terrorist groups in a
effort to thwart the U.S.-sponsored Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States found itself isolated in Seattle on many
of the key issues that President Clinton has put at the top of his
trade agenda.
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton ordered a halt to live-fire military
training on the Puerto Rican island Vieques and an end to all
exercises there within five years unless residents agree to an
extension. The action failed to satisfy demands by Puerto Rican
leaders for an unambiguous declaration that bombing would not
resume and for a date when the Navy would leave.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Rains Cause Flooding in Southern Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Heavy rains have been
reported in most of southern and central Somalia, relieving the
thirst of farmers in the central regions but ruining the life of
others in the south.
</P>
<P>
Serious water shortage caused by lack of rain during the rainy
season had badly affected the subsistence of farmers and nomads in
some parts of central and southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
But now week-long heavy rains have put the town of Sablaleh in
Lower Shabelle region on the brink of a total devastation.
</P>
<P>
There is only one way left open for the town before it turns
into an island, according to Abdullahi Abshir, a
telecommunications facility owner in Sablaleh, about 275
kilometers south of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses on the ground said thousands of hectares of
farmlands have been inundated. Almost all of the main roads
linking the various parts of the capital are now full of rain
waters.
</P>
<P>
Pools and puddles lie everywhere making most of the buses and
private vehicles incapable of working.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, cables of electric and telephone wires have been
down in the water as the pedestrians waded through the water to
make to the markets to earn the daily living.
</P>
<P>
It is not only the rain water, but river Shabelle has itself
crushed its banks on three points pouring streams of water to the
town from the eastern side.
</P>
<P>
The local authorities are complaining about serious food
shortage for the people and lack of grazing land for the livestock
especially affecting the cattle and goats since the camel could
still survive on the trunks of the high trees.
</P>
<P>
A large convoy of food aid from the World Food Program also
remains stuck at Muddul Brava, about 205 kilometers south of the
capital, on its way to Bay and Bakol regions where serious food
shortages and famine stricken communities are being reported.

<HEADLINE> Russia Hails U.N. Resolution on ABM Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Russia Saturday hailed a
resolution adopted by the UN General Assembly on preservation and
compliance with the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM).
</P>
<P>
The adoption of the resolution on Wednesday demonstrates a
growing understanding that although few nations actually fulfill
the ABM Treaty, it is relevant to security of all countries, and
the international forums, primarily the United Nations, cannot
ignore a threat to the treaty, the Russian foreign ministry said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The ABM Treaty, signed by the United States and then Soviet
Union in 1972, limits the number of weapons and radar equipment
allowed for each country and regulates their type and location.
</P>
<P>
The UN General Assembly passed the resolution by a vote of 80
to 4 with 68 abstentions. The resolution, initiated by Belarus,
China and Russia, won support from many developing nations such as
Egypt, Colombia and Mexico. The United States, Israel, Albania and
Micronesia voted against.
</P>
<P>
"The voting results reflect a growing concern of the
international community over the fate of the ABM Treaty, a
backbone of worldwide strategic stability. It also provides a
foundation to the system of international agreements on nuclear
disarmament and non-proliferation," the Interfax news agency
quoted the statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. plans for creating a national anti-missile system in
violation of this treaty" triggered international apprehension,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"An adaptation of the ABM Treaty to a U.S. unilateral decision
concerning the anti-missile system would signify abandonment of
the document's key limitation and in effect destroy it. Russia, a
signatory of the treaty, would not participate in such actions,"
it said.
</P>
<P>
"History proves that any attempts to strengthen one's own
security at the expense of others are doomed to failure," the
statement warned. "An abolition of ABM and nuclear disarmament
treaties, which are tied to it, would prompt a lot of countries to
revise their priorities and security methods."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the U.N. resolution has given a definite and
timely signal to those who want to forego the treaty. Such actions
potentially undermine strategic stability and international
security including that of the United States," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that Moscow opposes an escalation of arms race
while it wants to further arms control process.
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to continue cooperation with the United
States in reducing strategic offensive weapons on the condition of
preservation and compliance with the ABM Treaty. The UN resolution
proves that the international community firmly supports our
position," the statement added.

<HEADLINE> Russia Rejects U.S. Protest Over Leberknight Detention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The report said that the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB)
plans to show footage related to the incident in two main
television channels,
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department summoned Russian Ambassador Yury
Ushakov to Washington on Friday to present a note of protest over
the detention of Cheri Leberknight, describing it as "unlawful"
and inappropriate and demanding explanations, Tass cited informed
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ushakov turned down the protest and cited evidence of Russian
security services that indicated Leberknight's spying activities
with her diplomatic status, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, FSB spokesman Alexander Zdanovich said that "
operational video recordings" of Leberknight would be shown on RTR
and NTV, two of Russia's largest television channels, on Saturday
night. FSB is the main successor to the Soviet KGB.
</P>
<P>
Leberknight, a 33-year-old female second secretary working in
the military-political section of the U.S. embassy in Moscow, was
asked to leave Russia by December 10 without being allowed to
enter Russia in the future.
</P>
<P>
"Leberknight collected information of interest to her among
Russian citizens, and she even did not loathe contacts with
recidivists, before whom she set the task of obtaining military-
political information in one of the entities of the Russian
Federation," Zdanovich said.
</P>
<P>
Leberknight, identified by Russia as a career officer working
for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), was briefly
detained by the FSB last Monday, after "being caught red-handed
receiving classified military-strategic materials from a Russian
citizen."

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, December 4 (Xinhua) -- The largest Hydro-electric
Power Station in China located in Eryan went on line today.
</P>
<P>
The power station has six generators with a total installed
generating capacity of 3.3 million kilowatts. It will generate 17
billion kwh of electricity annually, about a quarter of the
combined power supply of the Chongqing-Sichuan power grid.
</P>
<P>
Ertan, located on the Yalong River in southwest China's Sichuan
Province, ranks as China's second largest hydro-power project
following the Three Gorges Project on the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the power station involved 930 million U.S.
dollars in World Bank loans, the largest World Bank loan ever for
a single project.
</P>
<P>
Since the first generator starting running in August last year,
one more generator has starting every two and a half months,
setting a record of installing generators with 2.2 million
kilowatts in just a year, said Liu Junfeng, general manager of the
Ertan Hydro-electric Development Company.
</P>
<P>
Yalong River has 33 million kw of water resources which can
provide energy for 12 hydro-electric power stations.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Calls for Revaluation of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe urged economists and environmental development agencies to
devise appropriate methods of forest valuation to give natural
resources their rightful place in economic development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the National Tree Planting Day here Saturday,
Mugabe said the contribution of forest resources to the country's
economy is being underestimated at just over three percent of the
gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
"The economic value of forests has mainly been based on their
timber value to the exclusion of all the important ecological and
socio-cultural values," the president noted.
</P>
<P>
Conventional accounting procedures underestimates the
ecological role played by forest resources such as protection of
water catchments, providing shelter to wildlife and providing
traditional medicines and energy to rural people, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Inadequate recognition of the value of forests and their
contribution to the national economy further impeded sustainable
forest management and led to wanton deforestation, he added.
</P>
<P>
To counter this, the government would endeavor to allocate
adequate resources to ensure the implementation of forestry
programs, Mugabe said.

<HEADLINE> France Cool About Breakdown of WTO Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 4 (Xinhua) -- France is cool about the
breakdown of the talks on a new round of negotiations of the World
Trade Organization (WTO) in Seattle Saturday.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said that "an absence of
result" in the talks is better than "a bad agreement" at this
stage.
</P>
<P>
"Europe came to the negotiations with an ambitious, coherent
and constructive stand. It is right not to yield and not to accept
the launching of the talks under bad conditions," said Vedrine in
a communique.
</P>
<P>
However, he said France will continue to consult its European
Union partners on the future talks within the world trade
organization in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
"Wider talks, beyond agriculture, remain our ambition," he said,
while calling on the WTO to adapt its methods and function to the
forthcoming "wider and longer" talks.
</P>
<P>
The WTO talks broke down early Saturday morning mainly due to
an impasse between the United States and the European Union over
agricultural issues.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, leader of the right-wing neo-Gaullist Rally for
France Charles Pasqua hailed the breakdown of the talks as "good
news" for Europe.

<HEADLINE> Russian Federal Troops Surround Grozny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 4 (Xinhua) -- A top Russian commander said
Saturday that federal forces have completely surrounded Grozny,
capital of the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"I can report to you officially today that the city of Grozny
is completely blockaded," General Viktor Kazantsev, commander of
the forces carrying out the Chechen operation, told Russia's
independent NTV television.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, federal aircraft are bombing rebels in Grozny and
the town of Urus-Martan, a major gateway to Grozny.
</P>
<P>
Su-24 bombers and Su-25 attack planes flew 25 sorties to
Chechnya in the past day, the Interfax news agency reported
Saturday, citing the federal troops' headquarters in the North
Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
The raids created blockades in the Argun gorge and damaged
several bridges throughout Chechnya, the headquarters said.
</P>
<P>
Airstrikes were delivered on south-bound retreating militants.
Early reports show that 30 vehicles carrying extremists from Urus-
Martan to mountainous areas were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
As federal troops stepped up their assaults, Chechen rebels are
persevering in their attempts to infiltrate the federal-controlled
districts of Chechnya and neighboring North Caucasus republics,
the headquarters said.
</P>
<P>
Russian troops have reportedly captured 97 of 199 residential
areas of Chechnya, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The current campaign in Chechnya came after armed incursions by
Chechen rebels into neighboring Daghestan and a series of
terrorist bombings that claimed over 300 people in Moscow and two
other Russian cities. Chechen rebels were blamed for the blasts.
</P>
<P>
Federal authorities said Saturday that up to 2,500 militants
have assembled in southeastern Chechnya as Chechen warlords plan
to invade Daghestan again, take numerous hostages to force Moscow
to end the anti-terrorist operation, Interfax reported.

<HEADLINE> Housing Fair Opens in Suzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, December 4 (Xinhua)-- The Suzhou Industrial Park
Housing Fair opened today in Suzhou, Jiangsu province. 183,640 sq.
m. and 1,339 units are up for sale.
</P>
<P>
Jointly sponsored by Chinese and Singapore governments, a 70-sq.
km. residential area will be built in the industrial park in the
east part of Suzhou.
</P>
<P>
The Park is the largest cooperative project to date between
China and Singapore. During a bilateral conference in September,
vice premier Li Lanqing and his Singaporean counterpart Lee Hsien
Looug discussed the prospect of developing the Park.
</P>
<P>
The Suzhou city government has worked out preferential policies,
including financial subsidies to encourage people to move into the
new residential area. Before the fair was opened, more than 7,000
people already moved into the new housing area in the Park.
</P>
<P>
The residential area provides a clean environment,
transportation and other community services, said Shi Yuchu,
deputy director of the administration committee of the industrial
park. Population in the residential area is expected to reach 20,
000 by the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
Suzhou is renowned for its beautiful canals, bridges, pagodas
and gardens. To relocate residents from the old city district to
the new industrial park is part of the government's decision to
protect Suzhou's historical and cultural relics.
