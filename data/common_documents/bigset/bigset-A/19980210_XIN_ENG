<HEADLINE> Government Controls Distribution of Counterfeit Spirits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The State Bureau of
Technological Inspection (SBTI) called on all areas which have
reportedly received lethal counterfeit spirits from Shanxi
Province to immediately crack down on the distribution of related
products.
</P>
<P>
More than 5,000 cases of bottled spirits suspected of contain
fatal volumes of methyl alcohol have been confiscated in
Heilongjiang, Jilin, Hebei and Liaoning provinces, and in the
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Counterfeit spirits recently resulted in the deaths of 27
people and the hospitalization of an additional 200-odd people in
north China's Shanxi Province. Local industrial and commercial
departments have since seized 4,000 tons of bulk alcohol and more
than 10,000 bottles of spirits.
</P>
<P>
The SBTI issued a Sunday circular calling technological
inspection departments at all levels to reinforce regulations on
production and sales of spirits, tighten controls on alcohol,
especially products containing methyl alcohol, and crack down the
production and sales of counterfeit spirits.
</P>
<P>
The circular also requires local departments to determine
exactly where potentially fatal spirits have been distributed in
order to prevent further cases of poisoning.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities should launched surprise checks focused on
both retail and wholesale distributors dealing in bulk alcohol and
cheap spirits, according to an SBTI official. He underlined that
Sichuan, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui and
Hebei provinces, all of which are home to related manufacturers,
should pay special attention to the problem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local technological inspection departments should
closely monitor producers in accordance with relevant regulations,
especially township and private enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Authorities are encouraging consumers to report all cases
involving the production and distribution of counterfeit spirits,

<HEADLINE> US Says Gulf Allies to Support Military Attack on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen Monday expressed confidence that the U.S. Gulf
allies would provide support to a possible military strike against
Iraq if the on-going diplomacy to defuse the situation fails.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if diplomacy fails to solve the current Iraq
crisis over the UN arms inspection operations, Iraqi leader
"Saddam (Hussein) alone would be responsible for the consequences
and we are confident that our Gulf partners provide the necessary
support."
</P>
<P>
Cohen was speaking at a joint press conference here with his
Kuwaiti counterpart Sheikh Salem Al-Sabah at the airport before
leaving for Oman.
</P>
<P>
His current Gulf tour has been described as the last efforts by
the U.S. to drum up support from its Gulf Arab allies for a
military strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. is authorized under existing UN resolutions to
launch an unilateral military action if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said "Saddam Hussein must agree to allow unfettered,
unrestricted inspections on the part of the UN inspectors and
anything short of that would be undermining the credibility of
the UN Security Council resolutions and undermining its expertise
and effectiveness."
</P>
<P>
Cohen's visit coincides an initiative by the Arab League,
Russia, France and Egypt to draft a new proposal to end the
current Iraq-UN stand-off.
</P>
<P>
He said "if there is to be a diplomatic resolution, it would
have to measure up to the standards for which the UN set up for
itself -- unrestricted, unconditional access to all sites in Iraq
so that we can determine he (Saddam) continues to build on
chemical and biological weapons."
</P>
<P>
He said Washington would rather achieve a diplomatic solution
to the crisis, but "the window of opportunity is not getting
wider, it's getting narrower."
</P>
<P>
"At some point in time, we will come to the conclusion that we
have an opportunity to be successful or there is no chance for
success...at that time the president (Bill Clinton) has to make a
decision," Cohen added.
</P>
<P>
He said "Saddam holds the keys in his hands to this crisis. He
can resolve it tomorrow by abiding by the resolutions that are
required (by the UN)."
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the U.S.-Kuwaiti relations, Cohen said "our
partnership is strong and military relations are close" and
"Kuwait is willing us to demonstrate its (U.S.) commitment to
peace and security in the Gulf."
</P>
<P>
Cohen arrived in Kuwait on the second leg of his Gulf tour
earlier Monday following his visit in Saudi Arabia where he held
talks with King Fahd Ibin Abdul-Aziz in Saudi eastern coastal city
of Jeddah.
</P>
<P>
A statement circulated by the U.S. embassy in Riyadh said the
U.S. and Saudi Arabia reiterated that "if Saddam Hussein refuses
to comply with the U.N. Security Council resolutions, he alone
will be responsible for the consequences of his actions."
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the U.S. did not make the request to use Saudi bases
to launch a possible attack against Iraq. Sources said Saudi
Arabia privately refused to let the U.S. use its bases in the
Kingdom to launch any anti-Iraq attacks. Saudi Arabia advocates a
diplomatic settlement of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Kuwait, Cohen held talks with Kuwaiti Amir
Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah and Kuwaiti Defense Minister
Sheikh Salem Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
Washington said Kuwait and Bahrain agreed to fully support the
U.S. military actions. It sent 2,000 marine troops to Kuwait and
six more F-117A stealth fighters would arrive here later to join
the other six stealth fighters deployed last November. But Kuwait
so far did not publicly declare to allow the U.S. to use its
territories to launch a possible strike against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Fights to Restore Dented Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe is battling to restore
its image as a peace haven in southern Africa after recent riots
caused by worsening cost of living and violent demonstrations by
disgruntled ex-guerrillas pushed it to the brink of anarchy.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe Institute of Public Relations, the country's
image-makers body, Monday said it believes the future holds
greater promise despite the problems of recent months.
</P>
<P>
"Zimbabwe has a tall order to correct this negative trend and
the institute calls on all citizens of the country, corporate and
individual, to rally together and rebuild our image," said
Vice-president of the institute Ray Mawerera in Harare.
</P>
<P>
He cited what he said were positive factors that would help
restore confidence in the country's position as "the pride of
Africa".
</P>
<P>
These included the resumption in aid by the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund (IMF), the stabilization of the
Zimbabwean Dollar and a good rainfall season despite earlier
predictions of an El Nino-induced drought.
</P>
<P>
While moving in forcefully to restore law and order, the
government also opened itself to greater dialogue with stake
holders in the economy who included the business sector.
</P>
<P>
The government also mounted its own campaign explaining that
the proposed land reform was meant to forestall future violence
and anarchy as the land-hungry masses would eventually seek to
grab the land to correct an historical imbalance in which less
than one percent of the population owns more than 70 percent of
the agricultural land.
</P>
<P>
The tourism sector has launched a campaign in niche markets to
restore confidence in Zimbabwe as a tourist destination, as have
other organizations, all trying to convince the international
community that the country has a bright future despite recent
disturbances.

<HEADLINE> UN Inspection Work Continues in Iraq: Iraqi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraqi weapons of mass
destruction continued its inspection work on Monday without any
obstruction, an Iraqi official said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Iraqi News Agency, Husam Mohammed Ameen,
Director General of the Iraqi National Monitoring Directorate,
the Iraqi peer of the UNSCOM, said that 12 inspection teams have
entered 17 sites for inspection.
</P>
<P>
A biological team led by Diana Simon, an American, visited the
premises and store house of the General Pharmaceuticals and
Medical Supplies Company in Baghdad suburban area of
Dabbash. Another chemical team visited a proclaimed site, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi official said that all activities undertaken by the
U.N. inspection teams were conducted with the help and support of
the Iraqi side.
</P>
<P>
In New York, Iraqi permanent delegate to the U.N. Nizar Hamdoom
announced that his country would permit U.N. inspectors to enter
eight presidential sites, and that a 60-day period had been fixed
for inspection.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believed that Iraq may open its presidential
palaces to U.N. inspection on condition that this will lead to the
lifting of U.N. sanctions on Iraq and that delegates from
U.N. Security Council members will take part in the inspection
operations.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's denial of U.N. weapons inspectors access to its
presidential sites on ground of sovereignty has triggered off the
confrontation between Iraq and the U.S. which has threatened to
use force to coerce Iraq into complying with U.N. Security Council
resolutions.

LONDON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan said in
London early today that his country can not support any attack on
Iraq which would make ordinary people there suffer.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, King Hussein said: "I don't think I would support action
that would affect the people of Iraq. The people have suffered
enough."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he also called on the Baghdad government to ward off
the threat of force by allowing U.N. weapons inspectors free rein
to examine Iraqi arms installations.
</P>
<P>
"There has to be complete compliance," King Hussein said,
adding that the international community was in no mood to allow
Iraq to possess weapons of mass destruction.

UNITED NATIONS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today decided to cancel his planned trip to the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the press, Annan said the discussions and
search for a diplomatic solution to the crisis over Iraqi weapons
inspection had reached a critical stage and his presence was

</P>
<P>
"I am going to stay here and work with all concerned in search

Asked whether he had tried to reach the Government of Iraq and
how his efforts are going, the Secretary-General said he is in
touch with all the parties concerned, with all the governments who
have sent the envoys, and in some cases with the envoys
themselves. And he is also in touch with the Iraqi Government.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Watches Closely Military Build-up in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus is monitoring Turkey's
military build-up in the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north and
ready to make appropriate response to any eventuality, a
government spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It is no secret that Turkey continuously reinforces its
military strength in occupied Cyprus, both in quality and
quantity," Manolis Christofides said at a daily press briefing.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Cyprus will carry out a joint defense pact
signed with Greece in 1993 should any event happen in the north.
</P>
<P>
Under the pact, Greece will provide Cyprus with military
assistance in case the Mediterranean island is attacked.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island to protect
the Turkish Cypriot minorities after a failed coup by the Greek
Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkey maintains around 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus,
which declared unilaterally in 1983 a breakaway "Turkish Republic
of Northern Cyprus" recognized only by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the Cypriot government expects efforts to
settle the protracted Cyprus problem will be renewed in March
after the election of a new Cypriot president.
</P>
<P>
The year of 1998 has been described as a "key year" for both
the peace talks between the Cypriot government and the Turkish
Cypriots and the accession negotiations between Cyprus and the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
"The international community is beginning to loose its
patience and wants a solution (to the Cyprus problem)," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The increasing number of
divorced people who remarry indicates that the Chinese people are
exhibiting greater lenience to those who choose to marry one or
more times.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from civil affairs departments, the
862,000 Chinese couples who remarried in 1996 represented a
substantial rise from the 500,000 couples who remarried in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, the Chinese capital, Shanghai and Tianjin witnessed
an average 14.67 percent increase in second marriages during 1996,
compared to the nationwide average rate of only 4.61 percent.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 percent of the country's 18 million remarried couples
are over 50 years old, with couples ranging in the 30-49 age
group representing 45.72 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Urban areas have witnessed more second marriages than rural
areas. In addition, Chinese society has tended to place greater

<HEADLINE> Chronology of U.S.-Iraq Crisis Over Weapons Inspections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. military forces are
busy building up in the Persian Gulf, preparing a possible
military strike against Iraq following the country's stand-off
with the United Nations weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, however, said it is ready to resist and fight back any
U.S. military aggression.
</P>
<P>
Armed conflict may break out again in the Gulf region at any
moment.
</P>
<P>
The following is a chronology of major events in Iraq's
confrontation with the United States since the end of the 1991
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
January 1991 - The U.S.-lead multinational forces drive Iraqi
troops out from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
April 3, 1991 - The U.N. Security Council adopts resolution 687
at the end of the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The resolution urges Iraq to destroy or scrap all its research,
development and support facilities for chemical and biological
weapons, as well as all its ballistic missiles with a range
greater than 150 kilometers. The process is subject to
international supervision and on-site inspection.
</P>
<P>
The 25-nation U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) and its five
teams are established to monitor Iraq's dismantling of weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
During the following seven years, the UNSCOM inspection teams
travel to Iraq to implement the U.N. resolution, and conflicts
never end between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
October 23, 1997 - The United Nations adopts resolution 1134 to
prevent travel abroad by Iraqi officials who have hampered
U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
October 29 - Iraq announces that all Americans on United
Nations weapons inspection teams have one week to leave Iraq. It
adds that the U.S. U-2 spy plane has to be substituted for another
aircraft from a country which is not hostile to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
January 12, 1998 - Iraq blocks a U.N. inspection team led by
former U.S. Marine Scott Ritter, saying the team has too many
British and American members.
</P>
<P>
January 13 - The United States says it would launch unilateral
military attacks against Iraq if necessary.
</P>
<P>
January 19 - The U.N. chief weapons inspector Richard Butler
refuses Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's proposal to end weapons
inspections within six months.
</P>
<P>
January 20 - Butler reports to the U.N. Security Council that
Iraq has prevented the weapons inspectors from doing their job.
</P>
<P>
January 29 - U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright leaves
for Europe to seek support for U.S. military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
February 1 - U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen says that the
United States will launch a significant military strike against
Iraq as soon as President Clinton makes the decision.
</P>
<P>
February 3 - Washington says it cannot promise an Olympic truce
by suspending military strike against Iraq during the ongoing 18th
Olympic Winter Games in Nagano, Japan.

Republic of Congo (DRC), said Jean Baptiste Muhirwa, prefect of
Gisenyi.
</P>
<P>
"The victims inhabited Ngugo village, in Byahi sector, Rubavu
commune which extends on both sides of the border," Muhirwa told
Rwanda News Agency which sent a special message to Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that this attack, the second in two days in
northwestern Rwanda, was carried out at around 10:00 p.m. local
time, under heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
"The militia armed with guns and traditional weapons sneaked
into the village, broke into houses and started killing people.
</P>
<P>
"They indiscriminately hacked to death babies, women,
children, old people, regardless of the fact that they were
Tutsis or Hutus," Muhirwa noted.
</P>
<P>
It is said that 18 families were entirely wiped out during the
attack. The carnage could have continued had not the army
intervened after it was alerted by local residents.
</P>
<P>
According to the prefect of Gisenyi, the wounded are being
treated at Gisenyi hospital. Military sources reported Monday
that eight people remain unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
It is said that after the massacre, the Hutu insurgents
withdrew back to the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The raid on Byahi follows an attack on Jenda, in neighboring
Runengeri District in which 35 people, most of whom former
Rwandan Tutsi refugees were massacred.
</P>
<P>
For Gisenyi officials, the Hutu militia have become desperate
and have alienated local residents.
</P>
<P>
"They have failed to deliver the promises they made, and have
run short of means to launch an assault on the city like last
year," Muhirwa said.
</P>
<P>
"This explains their campaign of blind killings. They no
longer separate Hutus from Tutsis. They indiscriminately massacre
people; they kill just for the sake of killing," he underscored.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Refutes U.S. Annual Human Rights Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, February 9 (Xinhua) -- A Foreign Ministry spokesman
for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) refuted
Monday U.S. allegations about human rights problems in the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Carried by the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), the official
statement was in response to the U.S. State Department's annual
human rights report released January 30 and was.
</P>
<P>
Allegations about the DPRK were groundless, the spokesman said,
adding it is foolish for the United States, which is unable to
mind its own business, to act as a "judge of human rights."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. attempt to force the DPRK to change its system and put
pressure on it under the pretext of the non-existent problem is as
foolish as trying to "sweep the sea with a broom," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States is itself abusing human rights, the spokesman
said, and it is not accidental that as soon as the report came
out, various countries ridiculed the U.S. rights performance.
</P>
<P>
The report was motivated by the U.S. intention to put the world
under its control by interfering in other nations' internal
affairs and forcing "American values" on them, he said.
</P>
<P>
The American concept of human rights will never work in the
DPRK and the U.S. intention to exert pressure on the country with
"human rights problem" is only a daydream, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The more loudly the United States talks about the
DPRK's 'human rights problem,' the more strongly the Korean people
are determined to always defend their genuine socialist system,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> 155 German Professors Call for Delay of Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Worried about the failure of large
European states to meet the fiscal criteria for the single
European currency, the Euro, 155 German economics professors
Monday called for delaying the planned 1999 launch of the Euro for
a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
"The Euro is coming too early," said the professors in an open
letter sent to the German Frankfurt Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper
and the London Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
While admitting that there is no alternative for the common
currency, the professors argued that the current economic
situation in Europe is not fit for starting the Euro on the
planned date of January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Major European states, including France, Italy and Germany have
started too late and only half-heartedly to get their finance in
order for the Euro membership, they said.
</P>
<P>
Despite extremely low interest rates and the use of the
so-called "creative bookkeeping", these core Euro states have not
succeeded in bringing their budget deficit under the Euro limit of
no more than three percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in a
sustainable way, the professors said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the average public debt level of the European Union
has not been reduced but has risen by 15 percent since 1991, which
is also against the spirits the EU Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
The German professors also pointed to the rising unemployment
in Europe and warned that especially Germany and France, the two
driving motors for the European integration, are not well-equipped
at the moment for the structural changes and more heated
competitions after the start of the Euro.
</P>
<P>
As a conclusion, the professors said: "A controlled delay of
the Euro for a couple of years with agreed conditions for further
progress on fiscal consolidations must be considered as a serious
option."
</P>
<P>
They also argued that delaying the Euro will not be a
"catastrophe". "The long-term success of the Euro is more
important than the date for its introduction," they added.
</P>
<P>
Undaunted about the academic challenge, German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl insisted that the Euro will come on time and that
Germany will be able to make the grade for joining the Euro.
Meanwhile, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel also warned of
damages to the German economy in case of a Euro delay.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Not Intending to Attack Israel: Russian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Russia Monday conveyed to
Israel a message from Iraq that Baghdad has no intention of
attacking Israel over the current weapons inspection crisis.
</P>
<P>
The message was conveyed here by Russian Ambassador Mikhail
Bogdonov to Dan Tichon, Speaker of Israeli Knesset (Parliament).
</P>
<P>
The Russian envoy said Iraqi officials had informed Russian
diplomats in Baghdad that Iraq did not intend to take any military
actions against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Bogdonov described the current situation in Iraq as "complex."
He said that Russian President Boris Yeltsin has maintained close
consultations with United States President Bill Clinton and other
world leaders in a bid to avert a military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Russia believes there is no basis in
international laws for the use of force against Iraq. He also
said that the Russian Parliament has conveyed a message to the
international community against possible U.S.-British military
strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Bogdonov said the use of force would damage the United Nations'
authority in the region and called on the international community
to solve the Iraq crisis through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reassured
Israeli public that Israel has both military and civil
preparedness for any eventualities, although the possibility of an
Iraqi attack against Israel is very low.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a group of visiting Jewish religious leaders from
North America, Netanyahu also reiterated that Israel retains the
right of self-defense if it is attacked.
</P>
<P>
"I want to stress that everyone should take into account our
principle position of having the right of self-defense for Jewish
people and state. That's a right that we don't intend to
relinquish," he said.

LONDON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- British government unveiled a
plan on Monday to lay on a series of high-profile arts
spectaculars in Northern Ireland to boost peace there.
</P>
<P>
"What I want to do is to see if we can get some events in
Northern Ireland, really to use the goodwill that exists. In that
sense I am sure there will be some major events," Northern Ireland
Secretary Mo Mowlam said in Belfast, capital of the divided
province.

have no doubt that there is a willingness out there in the arts
world to do all they can," local report quoted her as saying.
</P>

Famous British artists like Luciano Pavarotti, Garth Brooks,
Elton John and Van Morrison were being considered for open-air
concerts on rolling parkland at Stormont, just outside the city,
in May or June.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Africa Witnesses Major Decline in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- In Africa, where the
refugee problem has been most serious in the world, the number of
refugees has decreased to 4.34 million in January, 1997 from
seven million in 1993.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed in a book called "The State of the World's
Refugees in 1997/98" which was launched here recently by the
United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
In the Horn of Africa alone, said the book, the refugee number
is now at 1.37 million. For example, Ethiopia provided asylum to
321,100 refugees from Somalia, Sudan and other countries at the
end of 1997, whereas Sudan is home to 380,000 refugees from the
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Armed conflicts, civil wars and tribe fightings as well as
serious droughts and natural calamities on the African continent
in the past decades were two major reasons which have forced tens
of millions of Africans to be displaced or become refugees, said
the book.
</P>
<P>
Refugee problem has seriously hindered the socio-economic
development of the continent. Most of African countries are
either refugee origins or refugee residences. Even more
complicated, many African countries are both refugee origins and
residences.
</P>
<P>
The book cited the decline of African refugees to the
returning of millions of refugees to their homelands after peace
was resumed in their countries in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
The resolution of conflicts and civil wars in the last few
years in some African countries has created favorable conditions
for the refugees to return to their home countries.
</P>
<P>
Following the peace agreements in Mozambique and Angola in
last few years, Liberians held a national election in July last
year and set up an elected government.
</P>
<P>
In east Africa, the two main war factions from war-torn
Somalia, Hussein Aideed and Ali Mahdi, also agreed in Cairo,
Egypt to hold a National Conciliatory Conference in Baidoa,
southwest Somalia to pave the way for a national unity
government.
</P>
<P>
The return of displaced populations can make an important
contribution to the economic recovery of war-torn states.
According to the UNHCR, the returnees act as a catalyst for
development. In rural areas it is the returnees who are
spearheading ideas for change.
</P>
<P>
This new willingness and confidence in change is not confined
to men. Returnee women have been in the forefront of opening new
businesses and playing a leading role in the long-distance trade
in goods from neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNHCR, the repatriation of large numbers of
African refugees are still going on. A program to repatriate
Liberian refugees started in last December. While some 100,000
Burundian refugees will return this year, the repatriation of
20,000 Ethiopians from Sudan will be completed this May.
</P>
<P>
The number of African refugees and displaced people will
certainly decline in the future under the repatriation programs
undertaken by the African countries with the assistance of the
UNHCR and the international community.

<HEADLINE> British Nationals in Kuwait Asked to Take </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The British Embassy in
Kuwait Monday asked British nationals in the Gulf emirate to take
precautions in light of the Iraq crisis.
</P>
<P>
British Ambassador Graham Boyce said the embassy has
instructed the British nationals to maintain a reasonable stock
of food and water at home and make sure that vehicles are in good
order and have sufficient fuel.
</P>
<P>
"Beyond that, we are reviewing the situation and will keep
giving regular advice to our community as the situation develops,"
Boyce added.
</P>
<P>
The situations in the Gulf are tense as diplomatic efforts of
the international community have not achieved tangible results to
defuse the Iraq crisis and the United States is stepping up its
military build-up in the region.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was triggered by Iraq's denial of U.N. arms
inspectors' access to presidential palaces to search for weapons of
mass destruction. The United States, backed by Britain, has vowed
to force Iraq to grant unfettered access through military attack.
</P>
<P>
However, the British Ambassador said that "we continue to
believe that there is no immediate threat of Iraqi offensive
action against Kuwait."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Embassy in Kuwait also has instructed the
American nationals to take necessary precautions and asked Saudi
Arabia to allow the Americans to enter the kingdom in case of an
emergency.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF to Be Further Involved in Ethiopian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- a United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) official said Monday that the agency
will further enhance its involvement in Ethiopia in health,
education and other social sectors.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Executive Director Carol Bellamy made the pledge
during talks with Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and
President Negasso Gidada, the Ethiopian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy, who arrived here Saturday evening for her first visit
to Ethiopia, said UNICEF will give priority to human resource
development in the country in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNICEF director, Ethiopia is among the top
three beneficiaries of UNICEF-sponsored programs after India and
Bangladesh and the first in terms of cooperation programs in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF regards with high esteem the cooperation it has forged
with Ethiopia, a country with a significant role in the region
and particularly in the Horn of Africa, Bellamy noted.
</P>
<P>
During her meeting with Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum
Mesfin Monday, Bellamy said UNICEF hopes Ethiopia to ratify the
convention banning the use of land mines.
</P>
<P>
Seyoum assured the UNICEF director that necessary measures
will be taken by the Ethiopian government to ratify the
convention, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Mafias Suspected to Be Behind Murder of French </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Mafia groups are widely suspected
to be the mastermind of the assassination last Friday of the
French prefect in the Mediterranean island of Corsica, Claude
Erignac, according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Erignac, who was appointed the prefect in
Corsica in January 1996, had blocked a suspected mafia
"godfather" and some other dubious figures from buying a closing
military garrison for a casino-hotel project, and refused to let
them increase slot machines in a gambling center.
</P>
<P>
Corsica, known for its tourist industry with gambling casinos,
hotels, and holiday islands, has some of its prominent landlords
and financial players linked with Italian mafias in
money-laundering, said the daily Le Monde.
</P>
<P>
Le Monde also said that mafias are taking advantage of the
weakness of the local government and the decade-long problem of
nationalistic unrests to control the local economy.
</P>
<P>
President Jacques Chirac, who made a brief stay in Ajaccio to
pay his homage to Erignac Monday, indirectly held mafia groups
responsible for the murder and called them enemy of the republic
and the French nation.
</P>
<P>
"The murderous folly, the politics of the worst, the mafia
intention, have used the arms of some people to kill Prefect
Claude Erignac, who is the incarnation and symbol of the state. We
will not tolerate that," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested two Moroccans after the assassination took
place Friday night accordance with testimony by a witness, but
officials indicated that the two men were more likely innocent.
</P>
<P>
The Corsican nationalist movement FLNC-Canal Historique has
also categorically denied any involvement in the killing.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Import Salt to Reduce Domestic Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has announced
that it will import 60,000 tons of salt from Djibouti and Yemen
to reduce salt price in the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency Monday quoted Mulugeta Haile, head
of domestic trade department under the Ministry of Trade and
Industry, as saying that the recent price hike will be reduced as
the result of the importation of the item.
</P>
<P>
Some 40 businessmen, who had obtained hard currency from the
National Bank of Ethiopia, have so far imported 4,700 tons of
salt, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The National Bank of Ethiopia has approved 2.2 million U.S.
Dollars to this end.
</P>
<P>
Preparations have been finalized to import additional 9,250
tons of salt, he said, adding that 52 other businessmen have
plans to import more than 30,000 tons of salt in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The price of salt that had soared to over 300 Birr (about
43.46 Dollars) per quintal has now been reduced to 110 Birr
(about 15.94 Dollars) due to the fact that businessmen have been
permitted to import uniodized salt, Haile said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Ruling Group Nominates Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli ruling hard-line
Likud group Monday decided to nominate Shaul Amor as presidential
candidate to compete against incumbent president Ezer Weizman.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by the Likud Knesset (parliament)
faction without the participation of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Amor is a leading Likud malcontent, having been passed over in
the allocation of executive posts. He is leading a particularly
aggressive campaign for the nomination and Netanyahu did not
antagonize him, given the government's shrunken parliamentary
majority.
</P>
<P>
Although the Likud faction has nominated its own presidential
candidate, this would not bind its parliament members to vote for
whoever they chose under the party regulations.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Knesset will vote in March for the new president and
Weizman is determined to seek another five-year term with the
strong support of the opposition Labor party.
</P>
<P>
Even within the ruling coalition government, the Third Way and
Yisrael Baaliya (Israel immigration party) have decided to
support Weizman for the new presidential competition.
</P>
<P>
Some Likud parliament members also said that there is no way
Weizman will be voted out of office in the Knesset vote next
month, and thus taking a stand against him would only aggravate
relations with him during his second term.
</P>
<P>
Likud Knesset faction chariman Meir Sheetrit explained on
Monday that the vote for an alternative candidate against Weizman
"is not a move against the president but something which the Likud
has no choice about."
</P>
<P>
Despite all its years in power, the Likud has never managed to
elect a president of its choice, due to divisions inside the
coalition.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Welcomes French Proposal to Defuse Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Jordan Monday expressed its
welcome to a French proposal to help defuse the crisis over arms
inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan Ibn Talal, Prime Minister
Abdul-Salam Majali and Minister of Foreign Affairs Fayez Tarawneh
voiced their support for the proposal during separate meetings
with Jean-Claude Cousseran, a French Foreign Ministry official in
charge of Middle East and North Africa Affairs.
</P>
<P>
They told Cousseran that Jordan sides with France to make
contribution to the international efforts to peacefully end the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
France has proposed that Iraq allow the arms inspectors of the
United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) to enter the
surroundings, such as gardens, of the presidential palaces rather
than the residential areas, such as bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has barred the arms inspectors charged with overseeing the
elimination of its weapons of mass destruction from searching
presidential premises for the banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
The United States, backed by Britain and some Gulf Arab
countries, has vowed to force Iraq to grant unfettered access to
the UNSCOM through military attack if diplomatic efforts end in
failure.
</P>
<P>
France, Russia, the Arab League and some other parties have
opposed U.S. military threat and are carrying out intensive
efforts to seek a peaceful solution to the Iraq crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian leaders and official told Cousseran that Jordan
is opposed to any possible U.S. attack and also insists that Iraq
fully comply with the U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Cousseran arrived here Monday and traveled to Israel late in
the day.
</P>
<P>
He said during the meetings that France believes that any
military actions against Iraq will aggravate tension in the Middle
East rather than solve problems.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he emphasized that it is the only way for Iraq to
avert a war by offering an acceptable initiative and acting in
accordance with the French proposal, which he said will meet the
demands of the arms inspections while safeguard Iraq's sovereignty
and dignity.
</P>
<P>
French Ambassador to Jordan Bernard Pajolete Saturday told
Jordan's official news agency that Iraq has accepted the essential
elements of the French proposal and that France is waiting for the
responses of the U.N. Security Council.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Leaders Blast Palestinians for Supporting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli leaders Monday
criticized the Palestinians for expressing support to Iraq in the
current U.N.-Iraqi crisis, saying this justifies Israeli demand
for the complete revision of the Palestinian Covenant.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a group of visiting Jewish religious leaders from
North America, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu voiced
disappointment with the Palestinian community for their public
expression of support to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians have been holding pro-Iraqi demonstrations in the
past week to condemn the United States for threatening to use
force against Baghdad. The demonstrations usually turned into
violent clashes with Israeli border soldiers at checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, two big demonstrations were held in the West Bank
cities of Ramallah and Jenin. In Ramallah, one Palestinian protester
was wounded by rubber bullets as Israeli soldiers tried to
prevent the stone-throwing protesters from marching to the
Israeli checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
In Jenin, protesters burned Israeli and American flags and
chanted slogans to call on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to
fire missiles against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said the behavior of the Palestinian community
showed the need for Israel to press the demand for revising the
Palestinian Covenant by annulling the clauses calling for Israel's
destruction.
</P>
<P>
He downplayed the prospect of quick breakthrough in the
upcoming talks between U.S. officials and Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators in Washington. He said Israel can not hold
negotiations with the Palestinian side if it refuses to recognize
Israel's existence.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu accused the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) of
even refusing to recognize Israel's existence in the school
textbooks which include maps showing no mark of Israel.
</P>
<P>
"How can you make peace with Israel when you educate your
children that Israel does not exist," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Palestinian National Council must move to
complete revising the Palestinian Covenant in order to achieve
progress in the peace process. "They have to decide, the
Palestinians, either for destruction of Israel, or for peace with
Israel," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai also
warned the Palestinians against making a "serious mistake" by
showing direct or indirect support to Saddam Hussein. He added
that Israel and the U.S. are in tight cooperation over the Iraqi
crisis, and Washington will provide all necessary assistance to
secure Israel.
</P>
<P>
In another development, PNA President Yasser Arafat issued a
call for solving the Iraqi crisis through diplomatic means
instead of threat of war. Arafat made the comment during his
meeting in Gaza with visiting European Commission President
Jacques Santer.

<HEADLINE> US Defense Secretary Visits Oman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen arrived in the Omani capital Muscat Monday evening
on a two-day visit as part of his tour to the Gulf region to rally
support for military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Omani News Agency monitored here said Cohen is expected to
meet senior Omani officials and deliver a message from
U.S. President Bill Clinton to Omani Sultan Qaboos Bin Said.
</P>
<P>
Oman is the second leg of Cohen's Gulf tour which has taken him
to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and will take him to the United Arab
Emirates, Qatar and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have threatened to launch military strike
on Iraq to force it to comply with the U.N. Security Council
resolutions and allow weapons inspectors unrestricted access to
all sites, including its presidential palaces.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have been beefing up their military forces in
the Gulf region preparing for an attack against Iraq if diplomatic
efforts fail to solve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
So far, Gulf Arab countries were far away from a joint stand
towards the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain and Kuwait have reportedly said they will allow the
U.S. to use their territory as launching pads for the possible
military strike against Baghdad while Saudi Arabia refused to do
so.
</P>
<P>
The stands of the UAE, Oman and Qatar were unclear. Oman's
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Yousef Bin Alawi Bin
Abdullah said the six Gulf Arab countries will hold a meeting
during the next few days in Kuwait to discuss the
Iraqi-U.S. crisis.

<HEADLINE> Private Sector to Join U.N. in Investment Flows to Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations and
the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) will work together to
boost investment flows into Africa and least developed nations.
</P>
<P>
This was announced at a press conference by officials of both
sides here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan met with some two dozen ICC
representatives, mainly from multinationals of developed countries
this morning and they reached agreement on the matter.
</P>
<P>
The two sides support a proposal that the U.N Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD) prepare a series of business
investment guides to the least developed countries with the
cooperation of the ICC.
</P>
<P>
The guides will contain information on investment opportunities
and conditions in the countries covered, while business input
through the ICC will ensure that the guides are relevant to local
business needs.
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials noted that integration of the least developed
nations into the global economy is a major challenge facing the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Of the 48 countries identified by the U.N as least developed,
33 are in Africa, currently attracting less than 1 percent of
global foreign investment flows.
</P>
<P>
The lack of information was considered to have an impact on the
slow investment flows in least developed countries and the guides
are seen to play an important role in filling the gap, officials
believed.

ABU DHABI, February 9 (Xinhua) -- A French special envoy

</P>

The United Arab Emirates' (UAE) Wam News Agency reported that

MOSCOW, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma
delegation headed by Liberal-Democratic Party leader Vladimir
Zhirinovsky stranded in Armenia pending permission to fly to
Baghdad through Iran, the Itar-Tass news agency reported on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Ilyushin-86, carrying 12 tons of relief supplies, 48 Duma
deputies and 120 Russian and foreign journalists, arrived in the
Armenian capital Yerevan on Sunday night and is still at the
airport awaiting U.N. clearance to continue its flight.
</P>
<P>
Zhirinovsky said that "the air-traffic controller of Yerevan's
airport has not so far received the permission officially".
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, diplomatic talks are under way to get Iran's
permission to fly through its territory.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, the delegation met chairman of the National
Assembly of Armenia Khosrov Arutyunyan, chairmen of the
parliamentary factions and standing commissions.
</P>
<P>
The Armenian parliament speaker welcomed the Russian delegation
and noted that friendly, business-like relations had been
established between the parliaments of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said Armenia wants to develop these relations and fill them
with new content pursuant to the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation
and Mutual Assistance between Russia and Armenia ratified by the
two countries' parliaments.
</P>
<P>
Zhirinovsky, speaking about the current trip of the Duma
delegation, noted that Armenia was the only country that agreed to
receive the Russian plane with humanitarian aid on board.
</P>
<P>
He said it was evidence of true friendship between the Russian
and Armenian peoples.
</P>
<P>
On the situation in the Middle and Near East Zhirinovsky

<HEADLINE> Mubarak's Advisor: Action Plan on Iraq Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Presidential Political
Advisor Osama Al Baz said Monday that diplomatic endeavors in the
coming few days are expected to crystalize an action plan to
defuse the deepening crisis over the U.N. arms inspection in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Baz made the remarks after he met with Arab League (AL)
Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid. They reviewed the results of
contacts the AL chief has made with various parties on the basis
of Cairo's initiative.
</P>
<P>
The initiative, put up by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in
his capacity as the last Arab Summit chairman, called for an
active and effective Arab movement toward a political solution to
the Iraq-U.N. standoff, according to the Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Moves to advance the Arab initiative are "in progress and
proceeding continuously," said Baz. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
But he denied any knowledge of convening another Arab summit to
defuse the crisis triggered by Iraq's denial of full access to
U.N. arms inspectors its presidential sites suspected of hiding
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"Holding a mini-Arab summit to resolve the Iraqi crisis is
premature," Baz told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"There is still room for a political solution, Arab contacts
will be intensified within the next few days to avert an
escalation to the stand-off," he said, referring to an action plan
co-sponsored by the Arab League and France.
</P>
<P>
The plan, yet to be presented to the U.N. Security Council,
deals with conditions for inspecting sensitive sites as part of
international efforts to prevent the confrontation from erupting
into a U.S. military strike.
</P>
<P>
Baz said the plan has "not taken its final shape" at the
U.N. Security Council, adding that its viability "will depend
on the results of contacts to take place in the coming few days."
</P>
<P>
On the visit of Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf
to Egypt starting from Wednesday, Baz said Baghdad's stance on the
crisis will be examined during his talks here with AL and Egyptian
officials.
</P>
<P>
The presidential advisor stressed that "it is important to
know the attitude of the Iraqi government day after day because
the time factor is important and crucial at this stage."
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, the AL chief has met with Iraqi leaders
as well as Russian, French and Turkish diplomats in Baghdad, held
talks with the U.S. ambassador in Cairo and consulted with
permanent delegates of the AL's member states.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- China attaches much importance
to the development of its relations with Belgium and hopes to have
a sustainable and long-term relationship with it, Chinese Vice
Premier Li Lanqing said here today.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remark Monday during his meeting with Belgian Prime
Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene. Li arrived here Sunday with a
delegation of around 50 people. He is scheduled to leave for
Denmark on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Li said he and Philippe Maystadt, Belgian vice prime minister
and finance minister, agreed at their meeting earlier Monday that
both sides should make substantive efforts in order to further
develop their bilateral economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
China paid much attention to the planned visit by Dehaene to
China within this year in order to make it a success, Li said.
</P>
<P>
In response, the Belgian prime minister said that the Belgian
government would do all it can to further promote the development
of the relationship between the two countries, adding that Belgium
also hoped to play a constructive role in the development of
relations between China and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Dehaene said Belgium had noted and admired the achievements
China had made in its economic reform and construction.
</P>
<P>
Belgian enterprises had entered the Chinese market and the two
countries should make joint efforts in order to further enhance
their economic and trade ties, Mr. Dehaene pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed at the meeting that it was of great
significance to strengthen the cooperation between China and
Europe at a time when the world was going in the direction of
multipolarization.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Li expressed his support for the EU's
planned economic and monetary union (EMU), scheduled for launch on
January 1, 1999. He held out hope that euro would play an active
role in the world's financial system.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice premier also briefed Mr. Dehaene on both the
financial crisis in East Asia and China's current economic reform.
</P>
<P>
Dehaene praised China's efforts to make Chinese currency
Renminbi stable during the Asian financial turmoil, which he
believed had in turn played an important role in ensuring the
stability of both Asian and world economies.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to Belgium and Head of Mission to the
European Union Song Mingjiang, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of
China Wang Yingfan and Diplomatic Advisor to Belgian Prime
Minister Frank Geerkens Monday attended the meeting.

KHARTOUM, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Sudan has decided to close its
border with Eritrea to ward off the infiltration of Sudanese
opposition groups, local radio stations reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Governor of Sudan's Kassala State Ibrahim Mahmoud Hamid was
quoted as saying that the decision is one of the measures for the
purpose. But he did not mention the other measures.

Sudanese opposition groups have reportedly infiltrated from

roads.
</P>
<P>
Rumors have it that it is the Eritrean troops that have
infiltrated into Kassala State, and that the Sudanese troops are
fighting against them along the border of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea accused Sudan of supporting its opposition group
Islamic Jihad Movement and severed diplomatic relations in
1994. Since then, Eritrea has been providing support and shelter
to the armed Sudanese opposition groups, which are fighting to
topple the Islamic Sudanese government.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Heading for Downtown Freetown: Officer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior officer of the west
African peac keeping force (ECOMOG) said here Monday that the
sub-regional force is now heading for the center of Freetown,
capital of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Brig.-Gen. Abdul-Ome Mohamed, ECOMOG Chief of Staff, said his
troops had embarked on an "utter retaliation" to the unprovoked
attack initiated by the junta forces over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
"They initiated the attack and we'll carry it to the logical
conclusion to ensure vantage positions where our soldiers would
not be attacked," he told newsmen.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the ECOMOG troops is now heading for Kissoh,
the major supply port of the junta forces after the capture of
some "strategic areas" in the embattled country.
</P>
<P>
"We are now working hard to capture Kissoh base where the
junta gets its supplies," the chief of staff said, adding that
his men had advanced toward the city center of Freetown and would
continue moving.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed said that the fighting broke out last Thursday when
an ECOMOG soldier ran into land mines, losing his legs in the
process, while on patrol to Kossoh.
</P>
<P>
After that, the patrol was rained with "concentrated fire", he
said, adding: "we can't tolerate this unprovoked attack or
unnecessary killing of Nigerians."
</P>
<P>
According to Mohamed, some soldiers were wounded and others
lost their lives as a result of the onslaught. But he did not
disclose concrete figures.
</P>
<P>
However, the British Broadcasting Corporation Monday night
quoted a junta source as putting the casualty figures at no fewer
than 109, with dozens being killed, on the Sierra Leone side.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, people in Freetown are confused due
to lack of reliable news about the latest development.
</P>
<P>
It said that Freetown has become a dead city with shops and
schools closed down. there is few food on the market and the
prices have gone up drastically.
</P>
<P>
The fighting which started again Monday afternoon accompanied
with heavy artillery fire is continuing, the report said.

<HEADLINE> More Congolese (K) Refugees to Return Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Another batch of
refugees, approximately 750 from the Democratic Republic of
Congo, will leave Tanzania for their motherland by boat on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The voluntary repatriation of Congolese refugees should be
completed before the end of this year," Sadako Ogata, United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), told a press
conference here Monday.
</P>
<P>
To date, 18,741 Congolese have been assisted to return home
since last September, said Ogata, who arrived in Dar es Salaam on
February 7.
</P>
<P>
The press conference was held Monday afternoon soon after
Ogata's meeting with 43 ambassadors and representatives of
international organizations on the situation of refugees.
</P>
<P>
The situation of refugees in the Great Lakes region has turned
for the better over the past one year, she said, adding that some
500,000 refugees from Rwanda, the majority of refugees in
Tanzania, had gone back by last December.
</P>
<P>
As of December 31 last year, the total refugee population in
Tanzania was 346,703, according to UNHCR statistics.
</P>
<P>
However, the UNHCR chief acknowledged that problems still
remain in Africa's Great Lakes region. Of the 347,000 refugees
now in Tanzania, 268,000 are from Burundi.
</P>
<P>
It is unsafe for the Burundi refugees to go back because of
the military conflicts in their country, said Vincent Parker, a
senior external relations officer of UNHCR in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Ogata visited Tanzanian former president Julius Nyerere in his
home village Sunday. Both of them believe that the peace process
in Burundi is very important.
</P>
<P>
"No matter how much we try to help refugees, the solution will
not come until the peace process materializes," she said.
</P>
<P>
"So I have a lot of hopes and at the same time we have to have
patience, and try to help the refugees," she added.
</P>
<P>
She also stressed the importance to maintain the "civilian
characters" of the refugee camps, saying that UNHCR will help
train policemen to separate "combatants and or people who are
engaging activities that are not proper" from the civilian
refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
Last year Burundi accused Tanzania of training military
personnel at refugee camps while Tanzania flatly refuted the
allegations.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has also been irked by some refugees who have engaged
in unlawful activities, such as stealing cattle, hijacking buses,
robbing and even killing passengers.
</P>
<P>
The top U.N. refugee official also appealed to the
international donors to assist the affected community in Tanzania
which has hosted so many refugees for such a long time.
</P>
<P>
Ogata, who is on her seventh visit to Tanzania, will later go
to Burundi, Rwanda, Democratic Republic of Congo and Ethiopia on
similar missions.

<HEADLINE> UAE Backs Peaceful End to Iraqi Crisis: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) Monday said his country backed a
peaceful solution to the Iraq-U.S. standoff on arms inspection,
the UAE's Wam News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with visiting French envoy Jean de Jalinestee,
UAE's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Sheikh Hamdan Bin
Zayed al-Nahyan said the UAE hoped that the crisis could be solved
through peaceful means and it supported efforts made by Russia,
France and the Arab League in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The French envoy, who paid a visit to Iraq last week to help
defuse the crisis triggered by Iraq's denial of full access to
U.N. arms inspectors its presidential sites suspected of hiding
weapons of mass destruction, arrived here Monday afternoon on a
Gulf tour.
</P>
<P>
A diplomatic solution will help avoid "dangers of new military
confrontation" in the Gulf region, the UAE minister said. However,
he made no comments on the possible U.S. military strike on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Washington has threatened that it would take military action
against Iraq to force Baghdad to comply with U.N. Security Council
resolutions and allow weapons inspectors unimpeded access to all
sites.
</P>
<P>
Of the six Gulf Arab states, Kuwait and Bahrain have reportedly
said they were willing to let the U.S. hit Iraq from their
territories while Saudi Arabia refused to do so. The stances of
Qatar, the UAE and Oman were unclear.
</P>
<P>
The six Gulf Arab states will hold a meeting in Kuwait in the
next few days to discuss the Iraq crisis, Oman's Minister of
State for Foreign Affairs Yousef Bin Alawi Bin Abdullah said
Sunday.

<HEADLINE> White House Spokesman Criticizes Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- White House Press Secretary
Mike McCurry, in a speech at Harvard University Monday, blamed the
"frenzied environment" of media competition for causing
speculation and misinformation about the ongoing investigation
into U.S. President Bill Clinton's alleged affair with a former
intern.
</P>
<P>
"There's an awful lot of commentary that's designed to help
people form conclusions, but in this situation there aren't many
facts available to form those judgments," news reports quoted
McCurry as telling an audience at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
He said the public is skeptical about all the controversy in
part because they have an investment in the president.
</P>
<P>
"I believe they find it troubling and they do want the
information. But I think they're a little alarmed at how little
factual, helpful information they're getting from the news
reports," McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
He said competition "is ever more intense" among news
organizations in a climate where "opinion can quickly outrace
fact."
</P>
<P>
He said what has been referred to as a "media feeding frenzy"
has made matters worse. He said, "We have seen the tendency for
opinion to masquerade as fact, and perhaps evidence that people
who have larger purposes are deliberately misleading the American
people by providing incorrect information."
</P>
<P>
McCurry said the competition among news agencies has risen to
new and "very alarming heights," and has resulted in some
newspapers having to retract stories.
</P>
<P>
He said the American people as a result have "become ever more
disenchanted" with Washington politics.

<HEADLINE> S. African Housing Project Hampered by Lack of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 9 (Xinhua) -- South African
government's goal of building one million new houses in its first
term of office was being hampered by lack of resources, Housing
Minister Sankie Mthembi-Mahanyele said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We can't do it without funding, that is the reality," South
African Press Association (SAPA) quoted her as saying in Cape
Town.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2.9 billion Rand (590 million U.S. Dollars) a year
should have been allocated over five years in order to reach the
target.
</P>
<P>
This had not happened as a result of a funding shortfall of
one billion Rand (204 million Dollars), Mthembi-Mahanyele told
reporters and diplomats.
</P>
<P>
The building of one million low-cost houses in five years
constituted an important part of the new government's ambitious
Reconstruction and Development Program launched in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In his state of the union speech at parliament opening Friday,
South African President Nelson Mandela publicly admitted for the
first time that the one million target might not be attainable.
</P>
<P>
However, Mthembi-Mahanyele told SAPA that she believed the
government would come very close to reaching the target next
year, and that it would definitely be reached by March 2000.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that more than 400,000 houses were close to
completion or had been completed. With 700,000 subsidies already
allocated, this figure would increase dramatically in 1998.
</P>
<P>
She denied that housing was no longer the government't
priority, as it was when it came into power in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it is a question of housing not being a
priority, it is a question of whether the country wants to go
into debt or not, and what is best for the country at the moment.
</P>
<P>
"Do we increase debt or do we work toward reducing the
deficit?" she asked.
</P>
<P>
She ruled out an increase in taxes as a way of raising funds,
but said other measures were being looked at.
</P>
<P>
Mthembi-Mahanyele declined to elaborate on this issue, saying
that this was a matter for Finance Minister Trevor Manuel's
budget speech in March.
</P>
<P>
When the target was first set in 1994, the government had
estimated a housing backlog of 1.5 million houses. By mid-August
the following year, it realized that the backlog was 2.9 million.
This figure was increasing by 780,000 a year.

<HEADLINE> World Leaders to Meet to Tackle Millennium Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the world's major
industrialized countries are to gather in Britain to discuss how
to tackle the "Millennium Bug," The Independent said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper reported that following talks between British
Prime Minister Tony Blair and U.S. President Bill Clinton in
Washington last week, it was agreed that the issue should be put
on the formal agenda of the G-8 meeting in Birmingham in May.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said in an exclusive story that Tony Blair is
mobilizing world leaders behind a campaign for urgent action after
a warning that the "Millennium Bug" could provoke a 250 billion
pound (400 billion U.S. dollar) global recession.
</P>
<P>
The problem is that many computer systems are unable to
distinguish between the years 1900 and 2000, because the year
component of their programs is recorded by just two figures.
</P>
<P>
That will cause chaos on New Year's Day 2000 because millions
of computers across the world are programmed to "think" that the
year 00 means 1900.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Proposes to Form New UN Inspection Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Arab League chief Ahmed Esmat
Abdel-Meguid said Monday the organization has proposed that a new
team be set up specifically for inspecting eight of Iraq's
presidential palaces, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid told reporters that the proposal demands that the
head of the team should be appointed by Secretary General Kofi
Annan of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Iraq has accepted the proposal, under which
Baghdad would open 68 sites, including eight presidential
compounds, to the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of
eliminating its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, part of an Arab action plan to be submitted to
the U.N. Security Council, also entails a demand that Iraq comply
with the U.N. resolutions in a bid to maintain its dignity and
sovereignty, Abdel-Meguid added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has barred the arms inspectors of the UNSCOM from
searching presidential palaces suspected of hiding the banned
weapons.
</P>
<P>
The United States, backed by Britain and some Gulf Arab states,
has threatened to force Iraq to grant unfettered access to the
arms inspectors by military attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League and some other parties of the international
community have been making efforts to mediate a peaceful solution
to the Iraq crisis.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid will discuss on Thursday with Iraqi Foreign
Minister Mohammed Saeed el-Sahhaf possible outcomes of the
diplomatic efforts.
</P>
<P>
El-Sahhaf, due to arrive here Wednesday, is also expected to
hold talks with his Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa and convey a
message about the issue from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.

<P>
PARIS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Magdalena Maleeva of Bulgaria
was eliminated by a French qualifier Emilie Loit in straight-sets
in the opening round at the Paris Indoor Open here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Loit, 18, whose powerful left-handed shots shocked the world's
29th-ranked player Maleeva 6-0, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
"I can't explain what happened," said Maleeva.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously she's a good player, but that must be the worst
match I have ever played. It is very disappointing since it was a
match I shouldn't have been beaten."
</P>
<P>
Loit, who ranked far behind her experienced opponent with
234th, had never beaten a top-100 player before.
</P>
<P>
"Just getting into the main draw from the qualifying was an
exploit in itself. It is fabulous to have got into the second
round and to have beaten a player as good as Maleeva," Loit said.
</P>
<P>
She plays compatriot and fourth-seed Nathalie Tauziat in the
second round.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China's Civil Aviation Transport Continues to Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The number of air passengers
climbed by 1.3 percent on a yearly basis in 1997 to 56.3 million,
according to a national civil aviation conference held today in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1.25 million tons of cargo and mails were
transported by air in 1997, up 8.4 percent on 1996.
</P>
<P>
The total transport volume for civil aviation stood at 8.67
billion ton/km, up 7.5 percent on the previous year.
</P>
<P>
However, the growth rate for civil aviation transport has
declined over the past few years. Statistics show a 13 percentage
point drop in growth between 1994-1997 when compared to the
1991-1993 period. The annual growth rate for 1994-1997 was 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
Chen Guangyi, director of the Civil Aviation Administration of
China (CAAC), said that China's civil aviation sector has "entered
a stage of appropriately rapid growth" following an extended
period of major increase. He noted that the new stage reflects
the laws of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He noted a record 1,023 days of perfect flight safety, and two
million arrivals and departures during 1997, the best safety
record in the history of China's civil aviation sector.
</P>
<P>
CAAC presented safety awards to a number of airlines, including
Xiamen Airlines and China Eastern Airlines, during today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
Chen projected that the 1998 aggregate transport volume for
civil aviation will reach 9.5 billion ton/km. A total of 61
million people will travel by air, and the volume of cargo and
mail will reach 1.38 million tons.

<HEADLINE> Duma Denies Russian Link in Assassination Attempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Russian State
Duma on Tuesday denied the allegation that there might be "a
Russian hand" in the assassination attempt on Georgian President
Eduard Shevardnadze.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Seleznyov, Chairman of the State Duma, said the
Georgian leadership should not have revealed the suspicion against
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Considering the economic and social situation in Georgia, there
may be "extremists who are not satisfied with the situation and
who may intend to solve it by trying to assassinate the
president." he said.
</P>
<P>
The speculation about Russian citizens being involved in the
assassination was inadmissible, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Lukin, Chairman of the Duma's Committee on
International Affairs, told reporters that the assisination will
cause much emotion in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
It is very important that President Shevardnadze himself should
separate the emotional aspect from real long-term relations
between Georgia and Russia, he said.
</P>
<P>
All statements alleging that Russian citizens might be involved
in the attempt "have to be sustained by serious evidence", Lukin
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Georgian President Shevardnadze survived unharmed an attempt on
his life Monday night when his motorcade was enroute to his
residence.
</P>
<P>
Some earlier reports said the terrorist killed in the exchange
of fire was a resident of Khasavyurt with a Russian passport.
</P>
<P>
However, the Russian Interior Ministry's spokesman said a
Russian passport can be bought in any major city across the
Commonwealth of Independent States.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Production Falls Slightly in EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The growth of industrial
production in the European Union fell slightly in the latter half
of last year compared with the former half, Eurostat reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The statistical agency of the 15-nation union said in its
monthly industry report that the data of industrial production for
the three months to October 1997 showed that the growth of the
European industrial economy fell to 1.0 percent, from 1.5 percent
in July last year.
</P>
<P>
The EU had enjoyed a period of rapid expansion in industrial
production in the first six months of 1997 when growth rate went
up from 0.8 percent to 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the growth was not maintained as Italy led the decrease
from a development peak of 1.9 percent to 1.0 percent while
Europe's industrial powerhouse Germany witnessed little change in
the rate of increase of industrial production.
</P>
<P>
The German growth had been around 1.0 percent in between August
and October.
</P>
<P>
Spain was exceptional in that it almost kept up its increase
rate at 2.4 percent after four successive months of growth equal
to or greater than 2.5 percent in between April and July.
</P>
<P>
Eurostat, however, gave more positive development to Ireland,
Luxembourg, Portugal and Sweden that had managed growth rates at
4.4 percent, 2.9 percent, 1.5 percent and 2.6 percent respectively
for the August-October period.

BANGKOK, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States Tuesday
announced that it will increase its military education and
training funding by 25 percent for Thailand to 1.9 million U.S.
dollars for 1998.
</P>
<P>
The increase of U.S. Defense Department's 1998 international
military education and training (IMET) program for Thailand was
announced by U.S. Ambassador to Thailand William Itoh at his
meeting with Thai Prime Minister and Defense Minister Chuan
Leekpai Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The increase is also a result of the discussions between Chuan
and U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen during Cohen's visit to
Thailand last month and it makes IMET program for Thailand the
largest in the world, the U.S. Embassy said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
According to the IMET program, the royal Thai Armed Forces send
officers for training in the U.S. and U.S. experts come to
Thailand to train Thai military personnel.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy said that during the program's more than 40
years of existence, over 21,000 Thai military personnel have

MOSCOW, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Russia should watch out for
some western countries which are increasing political and economic
infiltration into other members of the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS), a Russian minister said Tuesday.
</P>

In an interview with the newspaper, Rossiiskiye Vesti, Russian
First Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov said some western
politicians never hide the goal they want to achieve in the CIS
region. That is to weaken Russia's influence upon other former
Soviet countries and to split the CIS.
</P>
<P>
Pastukhov, who is in charge of Russia's relations with the CIS,
pointed out that some western countries are openly sowing
dissension, encouraging other CIS members to drift apart from
Russia.
</P>
<P>
"Other independent countries on former USSR territory are
moving towards the West rather than just drifting apart from
Russia," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the loans received by other CIS members from third
countries almost doubled to 25 billion U.S. dollars, compared with
the small sum of loans they got from Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russia's share in these countries' foreign trade also declined
sharply to less than 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Along with expanded economic and trade cooperation, these CIS
members also developed political and military ties with western
countries, Pastukhov said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Sees Lower Poverty Incidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Trade Secretary
Cesar Bautista said Tuesday that the incidence of poverty in the
country is expected to have dropped further to 30 percent in 1997
despite the present currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
Bautista said the country has a number of hardworking and
intelligent people who can see their way through even during this
time of crisis which is believed to have slowed down the economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
"The number of Filipinos who see opportunity as the twin of
crisis and who climbed up the ladder of prosperity has been
growing," he said.
</P>
<P>
The deregulatory policies under the present administration gave
the private sector the self-reliance and dynamism to compete under
the rules of open markets, Bautista stressed.
</P>
<P>
The trade chief said high-skilled Filipino workers have been
attracting foreign investors to locate in the country,
particularly in the area of information technology.
</P>
<P>
Official data show incidence of poverty in the country declined
from 44.2 percent in 1983 to 35.5 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
According to Bautista, the gross income per Filipino grew from
10,000 pesos (379 U.S. dollars) in 1983 to 17,700 pesos (670
dollars) in 1997 while inflation rate declined from 23 percent in
1985 to 5.1 percent in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Israel Prepared for Eventuality: Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Israel is prepared to
defense itself and all military defense facilities would be in
place during the next few days, said Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai made the remarks in his address to a gathering at
Bar-Illan University while Commenting on the possibility of Iraq's
missile attack on Israel in the event of U.S. military strike
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Israel does not know when the U.S. military action against Iraq
will take place, but it should be prepared for eventuality, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Although Israel is not involved in the U.S.-Iraqi
confrontation, the U.S. military action against Iraq would have
serious implications for Israel, he said, adding that Israel must
be prepared.
</P>
<P>
Information received by Israel indicated that Iraq has a
number of missile launchers and some chemical and biological
weapons, but no body knows how Iraq would react after being
attacked by the U.S.-led military forces, he said.
</P>
<P>
The standoff between Iraq and the United States was triggered
by Iraq's denial of free access to U.N. arms inspectors its
presidential sites suspected of hiding weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The United States has threatened to resort to force if
diplomatic efforts fail to end the confrontation.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Iran's acquisition of missile development
technology, Modechai said that it was Russia who help Iran in
developing such technology.
</P>
<P>
He urged Russia to stop providing such technology to Iran
because Iran's missiles could pose more threat to Israel than
that of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
During the last few days, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu held a series of consultations with cabinet ministers
and top military brass to discuss the Iraq crisis, but no
specific plan of action has been announced.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government believed that the possibility of Iraqi
attack against Israel is low, urging Israelis to remain
calm.

<HEADLINE> France Warns Turkey Against Intervention in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- In an oblique warning to Turkey
Tuesday, France warned against military intervention in northern
Iraq to stop an influx of Kurdish refugees if a military strike is
mounted against Iraq by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Without naming Turkey, French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne
Gazeau-Secret said any such military intervention in Iraq from a
foreign country should be condemned.
</P>
<P>
France has repeatedly called on Turkey to stop military
operations against Kurdish rebels, the PKK, in northern Iraq. The
region has been out of the control of the Iraqi government since
the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman also reaffirmed France's support for the
territorial integrity of all countries in that region, including
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Reports by two Turkish private television stations, ATV and
NTV, say from 5,000 to 7,000 Turkish troops entered northern Iraq
last weekend to create a ``buffer zone.''
</P>
<P>
Turkey and the Democratic Party of Kurdistan, one of the two
major Kurdish factions in northern Iraq, have denied the reports.

DAMASCUS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad met Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf
Tuesday to discuss the current Iraq-U.N. crisis over weapons
inspection.
</P>
<P>
This was al-Assad's first meeting with an Iraqi official since
diplomatic ties between the two countries were severed in 1980
when Syria sided with Iran in the eight-year Iran-Iraq War
(1980-88).
</P>
<P>
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa also attended the
meeting and said his government believed "there is still room for
a diplomatic solution."
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi foreign minister arrived here Monday, starting his
Middle East tour that will also take him to Jordan, Egypt and
Lebanon in a bid to rally support in the face of possible
U.S.-British military strike on Iraq.
</P>

The U.S. and Britain have threatened to launch air strike on
Iraq to force Baghdad to grand U.N. inspectors unfettered access
to sensitive places suspected of hiding weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
"Resorting to force will not lead to a result," al-Sahhaf said
here Monday.

<HEADLINE> Russian Pairs Domiante Figure Skating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian duos dominated the
pairs figure skating at the 18th Olympic Winter Games here Tuesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
Oksana Kazakova and Artur Dmitriev led another Russian pair Elena
Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze to finish first and second in the
event, with 1.5 and 3.5 points respectively.
</P>
<P>
World champions Mandy Wotzel and Ingo Steuer of Germany came third
at 4.0.
</P>
<P>
Kazakova and Dmitriev had an outstanding and expressive teamwork.
Skating to the music of Passacaglia composed by G.F. Haendel, a
flawless performance in Tuesday's free skating earned them one perfect
6.0, five 5.9s and two 5.8s in presentation from a panel of nine
judges, three 5.9s and five 5.8s in tactics. Only the applause and
cheers from the crowds brought them back to the reality from a world
of fantasy after finishing their artistic performance.
</P>
<P>
It is the second Olympic gold medal for Dmitriev, who won the event
at the Alvertville Games with another partner.
</P>
<P>
"It's a completely different medal. Maybe first medal was more
difficult for pressure, but this medal is more difficult for
everything and physical also."
</P>
<P>
Their coach Tamara Moskvina admitted that the pair gave a thrilling
performance in free skating. "They gave a great enjoyment by their
skating. The public liked them and I was very thrilled because it was
mature men and women skating with great passion and power."
</P>
<P>
"It was difficult to win the gold, (as they have) different
personalities, different styles," she added.
</P>
<P>
Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze, second after the short programme,
jumped to the second through free skating, in which they brought to
the crowds an emotional performance.
</P>
<P>
The Russian pair, gold medal winners at the Champions Series final
last year, made a slight fault in their last composition in free
skating, which cost them the gold.
</P>
<P>
Berezhnaya bursted to tears and wept when sitting in the corner
in which skaters anxiouly waited for their scores.
</P>
<P>
To win the silver had been an exceptional tough job for Berezhnaya,
who just recovered from brain surgery after nearly dying two years ago
when her former partner's blade sliced into her skull as they
practiced side-by-side camel spins during a practice session. She
spent a month in a Latvian hospital and had to re-learn how to talk.
</P>
<P>
China made a breakthrough in pairs figure skating with Shen Xue and
Zhao Hongbo finishing fifth. It is the first time that Chinese pair
entered into the top six in Olympic figure skating.

WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- The Pentagon said it was sending up to 3,000 more American
soldiers to Kuwait. A senior military official said the Pentagon
planned to use the new troops to bolster Kuwait's defense against
possible retaliation by Iraqi forces. Secretary General Kofi Annan
canceled a trip to the Middle East in order to remain at United
Nations headquarters to help work toward a diplomatic end to the
confrontation with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright began the
Administration's final push for Senate approval of NATO expansion,
as President Clinton prepared to submit documents for expansion to
the Senate for ratification. The senate is expected to vote in
March to approve the addition of Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic to NATO.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- California and its neighbors in the Pacific Northwest have
discovered that their dependency on once-booming Pacific Rim trade
may have some drawbacks as the Asian monetary crisis ripples
across the ocean.
</P>
<P>
-- The Clinton administration's difficulty in winning
international support for a military strike against Iraq has been
compounded by links between the Iraq issue and several other
critical but seemingly unrelated foreign policy decisions that are
also on the table. Issues as varied as the future of the Middle
East peace process and President Clinton's desire for expanded
trade negotiating authority are parts of the equation as the
administration calculates how to proceed against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Sierra Leone's capital came under air and artillery attacks
by Nigerian peacekeeping troops, who have been fighting a junta
since President Kabbah was toppled in May. The Nigerian commander
said his forces had captured areas on Freetown's outskirts and
were driving on the center of the city.

trillion rupiah by the end of 1999 and to 3 trillion rupiah by
2003," said Bank Indonesia Governor Soedradjad Djiwandono, quoting
President Soeharto at the Bina Graha presidential office here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Soedradjad hoped the decision, which was made after
one-and-a-half-hour meeting of the Economic and Monetary
Resilience Council headed by Soeharto, will boost the merger of
private banks in the country.
</P>
<P>
The central bank governor said the present number of banks,
212, is exceedingly large. "The increase of the minimum capital
requirement is aimed at improving the efficiency and management of
banks," he said.
</P>
<P>
General Chairman of the National Banks Association Subowo said
that when the new decision gets to be fully implemented, the
number of banks by December would be around 28.
</P>
<P>
Subowo said that to deal with the problem of lack of capital,
private banks can take various steps like merger, acquisition or
invitation of foreign investors to join their banks.
</P>
<P>
According to him, there are only 10 or 11 banks in Indonesia
which have total assets of up to one trillion rupiah.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Coup Plotters May Face Trial This Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-six persons, including
civilians and women, are going to be tried in connection with a
foiled coup plot uncovered by the Nigerian government last
December, the military said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A special military tribunal of seven members from the three
services of the armed forces is expected to open the trial within
this week in Jos, capital of central Nigeria's Plateau State,
according to a senior officer.
</P>
<P>
"The trial will last about one month," Rear Admiral Festus
Porbeni, chief of administration of the defense headquarters,
told a news briefing this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The inauguration of the trial will be done openly and the
press will be allowed to cover it, he added.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal, set up in accordance with a law promulgated in
1990, is led by Sammuel Victor Malu, the former
commander of the west African peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG
operating in Liberia and Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Atop the list of the 26 persons are the country's former
number two figure, Chief of General Staff Oladipo Diya,
former Communications Minister Tajudeen Olanrewaju and
former Works and Housing Minister Abdulkarim Adisa.
</P>
<P>
The coup plotters were screened out a special investigation
board in nearly one month's probe. At least 60 people were
invited by the panel during the investigation.
</P>
<P>
The military government announced on December 21 last year the
uncovering of the coup plot and 12 people, including Diya,
Olanrewaju and Adisa have since been held.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry has also disclosed foreign involvement in
the plot to violently overthrow the government.
</P>
<P>
But Porbeni refused to comment, saying that the matter is left
for the Foreign Ministry to deal with.
</P>
<P>
The military has said earlier that all those to face trial
would be allowed access to "lawyers of their choice".

<HEADLINE> Philippines, US Sign Visiting Forces Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines and the United
States Tuesday finally signed an agreement on the status of
visiting forces which will enable the two countries to resume
joint military exercises.
</P>
<P>
The Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA), signed by Philippine
Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon and U.S. Ambassador to Manila
Thomas Hubbard, will provide legal protection for U.S. service
members visiting the Philippines for military exercises.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was concluded after more than two years of
negotiations. Contentious issues, particularly those regarding
jurisdictions over law violations by visiting soldiers of either
side, delayed its early conclusion.
</P>
<P>
The accord, which will take effect after being ratified by the
Philippine Senate, will pave the way for the resumption of the
long-suspended joint military exercise and training for Filipino
and American forces in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Siazon said earlier the accord will be submitted to the Senate
after the Philippines' May 11 general elections so that it will
not be used as an election issue.
</P>
<P>
All U.S.-Philippine military exercises were halted in December
1996 after Manila ended a legal provision shielding U.S. military
personnel from prosecution by Philippine courts for crimes
committed by American servicemen during the military maneuver in
the country.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Patent Applications Up in Recent Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- China has witnessed a
significant rise in the number of patent applications in recent
years, with over 110,000 applications filed in 1997 alone, up 10
percent on 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Patent Office of China reports that the number of
applications from domestic enterprises received in 1996 was up by
71 percent on 1995, and grew by 31 percent during the first ten
months of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Foreign patent applications have also been subject to rapid
growth, with a 45 percent rise in 1996 and 21 percent increase for
the first 10 months of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The rapid rise in patent applications indicates the healthy
growth of the country's inventiveness and creativity, as well as
an improved awareness of patent rights and increasing market
competition on the part of Chinese enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Related growth is also indicative of the fact that China has
improved its reputation for patent protection, and has beefed up
efforts to attract more foreign investors, according to a patent
official.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the use of patented techniques, especially
innovations in strategic areas, has produced desirable economic
and social benefits.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 96 of 100 patented techniques published in
the handbook released by the Patent Office of China have yielded a
total output value of 48.3 billion yuan (6 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
A recent survey revealed that the total outpout value for 73
patented products which have won state gold medals and awards for
outstanding achievement hit 14.15 billion yuan, with profits and
taxes standing at 3.89 billion yuan. The official noted that a
number of major patented techniques have entered the international
market.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 10 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki Tuesday called on the United States to
pressure more on Israel to ensure advancement of the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that necessary pressures be brought to bear
(on Israel) to ensure that this process moves on," Mbeki said
after meeting Asaad Abdel-Rahman, a special envoy of Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa was unhappy with the position of the
Israeli government, which was not demonstrating a commitment to
the Oslo peace agreement, South African Press Association
reported.
</P>
<P>
"We must all be of one mind that the principal obstacle to
progress is on the Israeli government side," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Mbeki declined to specify what steps the United
States should take. "If we had an idea of that kind (about the
necessary U.S. steps), I believe it would be more important to
communicate it directly to them first," he said.
</P>
<P>
The South African government was in regular contact with both
the Palestinian authority and the Israeli government on the peace
process, and would like to see faster movement towards finding
just and stable peace in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
But Mbeki said he or President Nelson Mandela would not get
more directly involved in the matter at this stage.
</P>
<P>
"It might be necessary another day, but as of now we think
that the role that the United States is playing is important," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Rahman is visiting South Africa to try to win more
support from the Third World countries for the endangered Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said the Palestinians were hoping for a "strong persuasion
process" to inform world leaders how grave the situation in the
Middle East is. He warned that the situation in the region could
explode at any moment.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 10 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo has called on the United States not to resort
to the use of force against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Alfred Nzo made the call while speaking to reporters in Cape
Town on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"When military action is imposed on that situation, the people
who will continue to suffer is the ordinary old man, woman and
child in Iraq, as happened in the past," Nzo said.
</P>
<P>
"We are for the solution of problems peacefully, not for bombs
raining on a peaceful population because the bombs won't kill
(Iraqi president) Saddam Hussein. They will kill innocent
civilians," he continued.
</P>
<P>
Nzo declined to speculate on whether relations between South
Africa and the U.S. would be affected should the latter bomb
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Vice-President Al Gore is due to visit South Africa at
the end of this month for a meeting of the binational commission,
to be followed by President Bill Clinton in March for a state
visit.
</P>
<P>
Last week, South African President Nelson Mandela criticized
U.S. policy on Iraq, stressing that Washington should stop
regarding itself as the world's policeman.
</P>
<P>
South Africa supported the UN resolution calling for Iraq's
capacity to produce arms of mass destruction to be destroyed, Nzo
added.
</P>
<P>
It was hoped that the longstanding investigation by the UN
team would have been completed by now, "because the completion of
the mission is closely associated to the question of removing the
sanctions that is affecting the Iraqi people," Nzo said.

NAGANO, Japan, February 10 (Xinhua) -- World record holder Hiroyasu
Shimizu became the hero for the host Japan on Tuesday when he sprinted
to win the men's 500m speed skating at the 17th Olympic Winter Games
here Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Hiroyasu, leader after first-day race on Monday, staged yet another
nearflawless display of skating around the M-Wave Olympic indoor oval
in crossing the line in an Olympic record time of 35.39 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Shimizu, standing at 1.61 meters, had a aggregated time of one
minute 11.35 seconds, 0.49 seconds faster than Canada's Jeremy

</P>
<P>
Shimizu punched the air with fists after crossing the line and shed
tears after the race, which was watched by Japanese Crown Prince
Naruhito and Princess Masako.
</P>
<P>
It was the first Olympic speed skating gold and the first
individual gold in 26 years for Japan.
</P>
<P>
Japan's last individual Olympic gold medal was won by Yukio Kasaya
in the ski jumping at the 1972 Sapporo Games before they claimed an
Olympic title in the 1994 Lillehammer Games in the Nordic Combined
team event.
</P>
<P>
The race was marred by Dutch skater Erben Wennemars, who earlier

</P>
<P>
Larissa Lazutina of Russia won the day's first gold medal when she
defeated harsh weather conditions to take the women's cross country
5km classical race.
</P>
<P>
After crossing the finishing line, the 32-year-old veteran bursted
to tears for her first Olympic individual gold.
</P>
<P>
"I have been waiting for the gold for a long time," she said.
</P>
<P>
With the victory, Lazutina, silver medalist in the 15km classical

5.9s and five 5.8s in tactics Wednesday evening.
</P>

after the events were cancelled or postponed in the first two days.
</P>
<P>
In the men's combined slalom event, Mario Reiter, combined bronze
medalist in 1997 World Championships, dominated two runs and built up
an aggregate lead of nearly two seconds over defending Olympic
champion Lasse Ajus of Norway for the concluding section of downhill
race which was planned for Thursday.
</P>

YINCHUAN, February 10 (Xinhua) -- With the rapid development of
telecommunications in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in
northwest China, telegraphs are giving way to telephone calls.
</P>

At the Posts and Telecommunications Office in Yinchuan, capital
of Ningxia, fewer customers can be seen at the telegraph counter.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Somali faction leader
Hussein Mohamed Aidid has left his country in an unexpected visit
to Libya, sources from his headquarters said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Aidid accompanied by four of his officials flew from
the dusty airstrip of Km-50 Tuesday morning to respond to an
official invitation from the Libyan leader Moamar AI-Kadafi.
</P>
<P>
It is not yet known the scope behind the three-day visit.
However, independent sources confirmed that the Libyan government
has invited Mogadishu's main faction leaders including Ali Mahdi
Mohamed, Osman Ali Atto and Mohamed Qanyare Afrah to pay the
visit.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports said the other three faction leaders have
submitted their apologies for the inconvenience to a Libyan envoy
who visited Mogadishu in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
The faction leaders are engrossed in pacifying the capital and
finding easy ways for the establishment of Mogadishu's
administration and the opening of the air and sea ports. Hussein
Aidid has left the country at a very crucial moment when many
important decisions need to be made.
</P>
<P>
The crucial issues include the settlement of the conflicts in
Mogadishu and in the southwestern regions of Bay and Bakol while
the deadline for the forthcoming National Reconciliation
Conference is drawing near.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Economy Dipped in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian economy saw a
slide last year after enjoying three years of picking up.
</P>
<P>
Figures were released by Constantin Chirca, vice chairman of
Romania's National Commission of Statistics, at a press briefing
on the country's economic situation for 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1997 totalled 249.75
trillion lei (about 30 billion U.S. dollars), some 6.6 percent
less than 1996, Constantin said. Despite this, agricultural
products kept growing and the foreign trade deficit was less than
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
He said the main reasons for the drop in GDP were the
depressions of industrial production and service trades, which
dropped 5.9 and 11.2 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The total agriculture production increased three percent last
year and the foreign trade situation improved because of the
increase of exports and decrease of imports.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate of 1997 reached 151.4 percent, much higher
than the 56.9 percent in the former year, the vice-chairman said.
</P>
<P>
Because of this, the unemployed totalled 880,000 last year, 8.8
percent or two percent higher than 1996, he said.

<HEADLINE> Controls Remain Despite Abandonment of Credit Quota Ceilings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The abandonment of credit
quota ceilings represents a significant reform in the macro
control of the country's financial sector, and in no way indicates
a change in appropriately tight monetary policies or a loose
credit control.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by a senior official from the People's Bank of
China (PBOC) here today.
</P>
<P>
On January 1 this year, the PBOC replaced credit quota ceilings
for state-owned commercial banks with a new management system
based on asset-to-liability and risk management.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that the goal of the reform measure is
to ensure commercial banks practice self-discipline and further
improve the quality of credit.
</P>
<P>
He said that China will continue to pursue appropriately tight
monetary policies, and the abandonment of credit quota ceilings
will not lead to excessive rises in the overall credit volume.
</P>
<P>
Practices in recent years fully demonstrate that the PBOC has
the ability to use indirect regulatory methods to cope with the
macro financial situation, and that commercial banks have
basically established necessary mechanisms for internal credit
controls, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
He added that the abandonment of credit quota ceilings will not
lead to excessive investments in fixed assets.

the Hong Kong-based Chinese institutions and mainland-funded firms
have done in maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and
boosting cooperation and exchanges between Hong Kong and inland
areas in the fields of economy, trade, science and technology,
education and culture.
</P>
<P>

institutions should adapt themselves to the new situation of "one
country, two systems", actively exploring new ways to accumulate
experience under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's theory.
</P>
<P>
Qiao urged these Chinese institutions to continuously study and
abide by the Basic Law, respect and support the SAR government and
refrain from interfering in what falls within the autonomy of the
SAR, so as to contribute more to Hong Kong's prosperity and
stability and development and the country's reform, opening and
modernization.
</P>
<P>
Present on the occasion were Qiao Shi's wife Yu Wen, Deputy
Secretary General of the NPC Standing Committee Liu Zhen, Deputy

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Drift Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market
drifted lower Tuesday as buyers remained on the sidelines during
the initial stages of the profit reporting season.
</P>
<P>
A lack of positive overseas leads and profit taking
opportunities after Monday's strong market also contributed to the
all ordinaries index fall of 17.3 points to 2668.0.
</P>
<P>
"Buyers are standing aside waiting for these profit
announcements coming out. There is a bit of a concern about the
impact Asia might have on these reports," Steve Mayne from Nevitts
said.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said the Commonwealth Bank interim result due out
Wednesday would be closely watched as a guide to market prospects,
particularly in the vital banking sector.
</P>
<P>
Reports from some second tier companies were released Tuesday
and over recent days, but brokers said these had not had an
impact.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index fell 25 points to 4535.9, with falls
in retailer Coles Myer and media giant News Corporation among the
more noticeable.
</P>
<P>
Coles dropped 11.9 cents with similar falls in many other
retailing stocks after Monday's news that electronics and music
retailer Brashs was placed in the hands of administrators.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said profit taking was greater in resource stocks,
which combined with lower commodity prices to lead the all
resources index down 11.8 points to 1183.3.
</P>
<P>
BHP was the main sufferer among the major resources, falling 32
cents, Rio Tinto was the most traded stock by value and fell 15.4
cents on volume of 2.90 million shares, WMC dropped 10 cents.
</P>
<P>
The gold index lifted 7.1 points to 1173.2 as the bullion price
rose 0.55 per ounce to 299.45 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
National turnover Tuesday was 269.16 million shares at a value
of 735.64 million Australian dollars (482.87 million U.S.
dollars), with falls bettering rises 594 to 446.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique, S. Africa in Dilemma Over Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Though talks over the power
supply to South Africa from Mozambique's Cahora Bassa hydro-power
station is making headway, there are still obstacles for a final
solution.
</P>
<P>
Casimiro Francisco, Director of the National Energy Bureau of
Mozambique said that South Africa has agreed to separate the
power price from the inflation in the country, the two sides are
still quite apart from reaching a final agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Cahora Bassa Hydro-power Station in Mozambique, built in
the late 70s, claims to be one of the largest power station in
Africa. It was designed to supply power to South Africa at a very
low price as both sides agreed.
</P>
<P>
But the power station was heavily damaged in the 80s during
the civil war in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Though Mozambique has invested about 120 million U.S. Dollars
in revamping the power station and repairing the lines linking
South Africa and the power station, South Africa still refuses to
buy electricity from it.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has linked inflation with the price of
electricity from the station, but analysts said that South
Africa's high electric energy production is the main reason for
its refusal to buy power from Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
It is said that South Africa itself can produce 39,000
mega-watts of electricity every year, 5000 mega-watts more than
it needs.

<P>
-- President Jacques Chirac, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and
other government and parliament figures paid hommage Monday to
Claude Erignac, the prefect of Corsica who was assassinated. Many

the island.
</P>
<P>
-- Deputies of the National Assembly will vote Tuesday the draft
law on 35 hour work week. The law is expected to be adopted by the
parliament after two weeks of debate in which the leftwing majority
succeded in holding on to their position. The law, to be presented
to the Senate on March 3, plans to reduce weekly working time to 35
hours by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- During a ceremony in memory of Claude Erignac, the prefect of
Corsica assassinated last Friday, President Jacques Chirac said that
France will not tolerate this kind of assassination which
jeopardizes the authority of the French state and the integrity of
the country.
</P>
<P>
-- The riots in Indonesia caused by rising prices and a fear of
shortage of daily necessities are targeting the wealthy Chinese
community. On the island of Flores, hundreds of ethnic Chinese had
to take shelter in army barracks and police stations on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Eastern China Expanding Overseas Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Economically-developed Jiangsu
Province in eastern China has been making an effort since 1992 to
increase economic cooperation overseas and has economic and
technological cooperation projects in more than 120 countries and
regions, mainly in Asia and Africa, according to the Provincial
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Committee.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, the province had 49 companies specializing
in international economic and technological cooperation, compared
to only two in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the province signed new international economic and
technological cooperation contracts worth 860 million
U.S. dollars, and did 845 million U.S. dollars worth of business,
up 18.1 percent and 24 percent, respectively, from the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
It also sent 22,300 people overseas for labor projects, a 31
percent increase over 1996, and 34,400 people from Jiangsu worked
on various international economic and technological cooperation
projects abroad.
</P>
<P>
As its investment structure improves, the province's overseas
economic and technological cooperation changes. Overseas
cooperation has gone from mainly labor exports to larger
contracts, sub-contracting and general project contracting, and
from providing simply physical labor to technological and
administrative services.
</P>
<P>
The areas of overseas cooperation have also grown from
construction to agriculture, power, building materials, road and
bridge building, petrochemicals, and coal.

<HEADLINE> Denmark Extends Transitional Aid to S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Danish government
would extend its transitional development assistance to South
Africa for three years with an allocation of 100 million Rand
(20.4 million U.S. dollars), visiting Danish Prime Minister Poul
Nyrup Rasmussen said in Cape Town on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A five-year transitional development aid totaling 106 million
dollars from Denmark is due to expire at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Denmark was among the first countries to provide transitional
aid to South Africa after the 1994 democratic election.
</P>
<P>
After talks with South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki,
Rasmussen also announced a further 32.6-million-dollar aid for
environmental projects, according to South African Press
Association.
</P>
<P>
Explaining his government's decision to extend its
transitional aid, Rasmussen said: "I think it would be wrong at
this stage of our cooperation that we say `good-bye, thank you,
nice to see you, and now we have business-to business market
economy as we have with all other countries of the world.`"
</P>
<P>
On South Africa's negotiations with the European Union (EU)
for a free trade agreement, Rasmussen said his government would
do all it could to assist and support South Africa to ensure it
was signed this year.
</P>
<P>
An agreement with the EU was fundamental for Europe if it
wanted to demonstrate that, like Denmark, it was prepared to back
South Africa's transition.
</P>
<P>
In view of the fact that South Africa is still in transition,
the agreement should recognize a positive net advantage for South
Africa's development, he said.
</P>
<P>
The South African side proposed that a free trade process
would be completed in 12 years with the EU reducing its tariffs
at a faster pace.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said development assistance was very important and
critical for South Africa's transition, but that the government
did not believe this should be a permanent situation.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly we have to depend to an increasing extent on our own
resources."
</P>
<P>
On increased economic ties with Denmark, Mbeki said there
should be greater participation from Danish companies and that a
ministerial delegation would visit Denmark later this year to
market South Africa.
</P>
<P>
During his week-long stay in South Africa, Rasmussen is also
expected to meet President Nelson Mandela, National Assembly
Speaker Frene Ginwala, Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo and some other
cabinet ministers.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Hits Hard Blow on Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stephen Selby, Director of Intellectual Property said at a
press conference Tuesday: "Over the last 12 months, Hong Kong has
brought in three comprehensive new localized laws to protect
intellectual property to the highest international standards."
</P>
<P>
The three new laws, passed on June 27, 1997, are Copyright
Ordinance, Patents Ordinance and Registered Designs Ordinance.
</P>
<P>
Selby said that the Geneva-based World Intellectual Property
Organization (WIPO) had praised Hong Kong for its endeavors in
building up a complete intellectual property protection system.
</P>
<P>
Two more laws are expected to come into effect in 1998,
including Prevention of Copyright Piracy Bill and Trade Mark Bill,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong established a computerized patent search system in
1997 to make applications much more efficient.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, from June 27 to December 31 last
year, the Intellectual Property Department received 1,179
applications for standard patents, 30 for short-term patents, and
960 for industrial designs.
</P>
<P>
As to the implementation of the law, Selby said that Hong Kong
Customs seized 4.6 million suspected pirated compact discs in
1997, a five-fold increase over the previous year. Hong Kong court
put 256 people in prison for trading pirated and fake goods last
year, three times the number of people jailed for the same reason
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
An enforcement force of intellectual property rights protection
under Hong Kong Customs now comprises 188 officers, more than
doubling the number in 1993, according to the SAR official.
</P>
<P>
The director reviewed that his department had made great
efforts over the past year to promote the value of intellectual
property protection, by spending hundreds of hours and thousands
of Hong Kong dollars in teaching publicity materials, visiting
secondary schools and talking with university students.

<P>
CANBERRA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- More Australians are now
supporting a republic in the country, the latest bulletin Morgan
poll showed.
</P>
<P>
The poll, held during the first days of the Constitutional
Convention last week, found 52 percent of Australians aged 14
years or over wanted a republic, up one percent since December.
</P>
<P>
A further 37 percent thought Australia should remain a
monarchy, a fall of one percent, while 11 percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
But the number of people who would prefer a popularly-elected
head of state was down six percent over the past six months to 68
percent.
</P>
<P>
Republicans at the Constitutional Convention are struggling to
find unity on the issue of whether a head of state should be
elected by the people or a two-thirds majority of parliament.
</P>
<P>
The poll, to be published in the bulletin Wednesday, found both
a head of state chosen by a two-thirds majority of parliament or
the McGarvie model for a panel of eminent Australians to select a
list of candidates would have failed if put to a referendum this
month.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 642 people showed 50 percent of voting
Australians supported a republic under both models.
</P>
<P>
But only 57 percent of them were aware of the role of the
British monarch in appointing and dismissing the governor-general
on the advice of the prime minister.

the "M-Wave".
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Japanese, who set the world record of 35.39 seconds
at the World Cup in Calgary, Canada two years gao, skated to his
roaring home crowds with another new Games record of 35.59 seconds in
the second and final run race, collecting a winning time of one minute
and 11.35 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Shimizu led the first run race on Monday in 35.76 seconds and broke
the old Games record of 36.33 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Aftger making the Japanese Winter Olympic history and stepping down
the medalists podium, Shimizu skated around the rink flying the
national flag with tears streaming down his face.
</P>
<P>
"My long dream has come true," Shimizu said. "But, I had no idea
whether this was really happening or not.
</P>
<P>
"I want to report this to my late father, but can not find any word
at the moment."
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Wotherspoon of Canada, who placed seventh in 36.04 in
Monday's race, came bake strongly with 35.80 seconds to win the silver
medal in a total time of 1:11.84.
</P>
<P>
Wotherspoon's countryman Kevin Overland took the bronze after he
finished a disappointed performance of 36.08 in the second run race
for a total time of 1:11.86 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Overland placed second on Monday in 35.68, a mere two-100ths of a

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Against Military Action on Iraq: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister
Rafic Hariri said here Tuesday his country is against military
action on Iraq and wants Baghdad to cooperate with United Nations'
weapon inspection missions.
</P>
<P>
"We are totally against the war and also we are totally with
the implementation of UN and Security Council resolutions,"
Hariri, who arrived here Monday for a two-day visit, said during a
luncheon talk here while responding to questions on Lebanon's
stand on the current UN-Iraq standoff.
</P>
<P>
Hariri said Lebanon would like to see Iraq cooperating with the
UN inspectors who are in Baghdad to ensure that all Iraqi
mass-destruction weapons have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
However, Hariri said, as regards compliance with UN Security
Council resolutions, the Lebanese people could not understand the
double standards of some countries involved in assessing the Iraqi
situation.
</P>
<P>
"Israel is not implementing the resolutions of the United
Nations and they are not respecting all that they have agreed upon
-- and nobody is criticizing them or punishing them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the luncheon, the visiting Lebanese prime minister
said that Malaysia can emerge stronger from the current regional
financial crisis as it has a strong economy, leadership and social
unity.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Malaysia has strong fundamentals to overcome its
problems, including having a budget surplus, an acceptable debt
level, not too high interest rates and a low rate of inflation.
</P>
<P>
He said the Asian financial crisis would equip Malaysia with
the experience to resist similar crisis in the future, adding that
Malaysia's financial turmoil was a ripple effect from problems
faced by its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Hariri identified the areas where Malaysians could invest in
Lebanon which included high technology and semi hi-tech
industries, saying Malaysian investors should not view Lebanon as
a single market but a springboard to the Arab countries.

NEW DELHI, February 10 (Xinhua) -- India's tyre exports to
Pakistan have increased and crossed 200 million rupees (5.33
million US dollars) within a few months of revival of tyre
exports, Press Trust of India (PTI) said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
India's tyre exports to Pakistan, which were revived in August
last year, have been put at 204.1 million rupees (5.44 million
dollars) by an Automotive Tyre Manufacturers Association (ATMA)
data until December 31 last year.
</P>
<P>
The picking up of Indian tyres by Pakistan was also reflected

percent during the first nine months of the current financial year
(April 1, 1997-March 31, 1998).
</P>

India's total tyre exports during this period increased to

rupees (134.24 million dollars) during the same period last year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Singapore Receives 7.2 Million Visitors in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Singapore received a total
of 7.2 million visitors in 1997, representing a fall of 1.3
percent compared with the previous year, the Singapore Tourism
Board (STB) announced on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It attributed the decline to the regional economic and the haze
threat that took place between August and November in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The STB also predicted that visitor arrivals to Singapore this
year will fall to just 6.5 million visitors. And the sharpest drop
in the number of arrivals is expected to come from the Asian
region.
</P>
<P>
However, Yeo Khee Leng, Chief Executive of the STB, said at a
press conference that he expected an increase in tourists from
Europe, North America and Oceania in the year.
</P>
<P>
On hotel occupancy rates, he said that it declined to 79.5
percent last year from 82.2 percent in 1996, thus putting pressure
on room rates.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Diplomatic Solution Preferred to Gulf Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Deeply concerned by the
escalating gulf crisis, the international community is stepping up
diplomacy for a peaceful solution, believing that U.S. air
strikes on Iraq would only lead to growing tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
Three U.S. aircraft carriers and more than 400 U.S. aircraft
are already in the region to handle the attack mission. More than
30,000 American soldiers in the region are reported to have been
put on the alert.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a British aircraft carrier has arrived in the
gulf. U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen has declared that if
the United States decided to use force against Iraq, the attack
would be carried out on an ever large scale.
</P>
<P>
The on-going standoff between the United States and Iraq, which
arose out of the U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq, has been
brewing for quite some time.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure its oil supply from the oil-rich gulf
region, the United States has adopted a policy of "containment"
toward both Iraq and Iran since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Because of the seven-year-old U.N. sanctions, Iraq has suffered
a loss of 120 billion U.S. dollars in oil exports alone while more
than 1 million Iraqi women and children have lost their lives due
to shortage of food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, which is eager to seek an early end to the sanctions, has
finally lost its patience after the United States has repeatedly
succeeded in preventing an early end to the U.N. weapons
inspections.
</P>
<P>
According to relevant U.N. resolutions, the punishing sanctions
imposed on Iraq cannot be lifted until the inspectors certify that
Iraq has eliminated all its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Blaming the United States for being solely responsible for the
country's sustained suffering, Iraq began to argue with the
U.S. side over the weapons inspections issue and refused to grant
U.N. inspectors free access to what it considers sensitive sites
of national sovereignty concerns.
</P>
<P>
A defiant Iraq embarrassed Washington and made its hackles
rise. Washington threatened to teach Baghdad a lesson.
</P>
<P>
By launching a fresh military attack, Washington attempts to
strike two birds with one stone -- further weaken Iraq and contain
Iran -- so that it can maintain its long-term military presence
in the gulf region.
</P>
<P>
But in today's world, peace is the trend of the times and the
desire of the people. Resorting to force can hardly win
international support.
</P>
<P>
The canvassing made by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright to seek support for the U.S.-initiated military attack
against Iraq ended in vain.
</P>
<P>
Most countries in the world, except a few like Britain and
Israel, have opposed military action.
</P>
<P>
In the U.N. Security Council, China, Russia and France stand
for a sober, fair and objective treatment of the state of
affairs. They held that Iraq's national sovereignty, dignity and
security should be respected, while Iraq should completely and
conscientiously implement the relevant resolutions adopted by the
U.N. Security Council and closely cooperate with the U.N. weapons
inspectors for an earlier lift of the U.N.-imposed sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the United States pursues double standards in the
Middle East -- containing Iraq while being biased in favor of
Israel although both have violated U.N. resolutions, has deeply
hurt the feelings of the Arab people.
</P>
<P>
Proceeding from their common stand of nationalism, most Arab
countries are against military action against Iraq. Most Gulf
nations, which have experienced war tragedies, are in favor of a
peaceful solution. Saudi Arabia and Turkey, two key U.S. allies,
have disagreed with the United States on using their military
bases for raiding Iraq.
</P>
<P>
People of insight believe that the use of force would not
help end the crisis. Instead, it would aggravate regional tension
and make the problem even more complicated.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, it would cause more sufferings to the Iraqi people
and be detrimental to the strategic interests of the United States
in the region.

LONDON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has built up big stocks of
the nerve gas Agent 15, which is designed to stupefy enemy forces,
Defense Secretary George Robertson told MPs Monday.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- As the U.S. administration tries to formulate a coherent
policy toward Iraq, it faces a familiar dilemma: anything it
proposes is either too soft for its critics in the Republican-led
Congress, or too hard for its allies and United Nations partners.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Pressure for the European single currency to be delayed will
intensify when Neil Kinnock, one of Britain's European Union
Commissioners, launches a report attacking the EU for imposing
such projects. He said Europe is taking a huge risk in forcing the
pace of economic and political integration.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- A new framework of national tests to measure children's
learning at almost every stage in primary school was announced

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for Turkish Troop Pullback From Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran Tuesday called on Turkey
to withdraw its troops from northern Iraq, saying the deployment
of Turkish forces in the area would add tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) quoted Foreign Ministry
spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi as saying the Turkish military
buildup in northern Iraq would only aggravate the situation in
the region since the Iraqi crisis is escalating and there is a
possible U.S. military attack against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that Iran calls for an immediate
withdrawal of Turkish troops from northern Iraq, adding that
Iran's principled stand is that the full territorial integrity of
Iraq should be respected.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has planned to set up a "security zone" in northern Iraq
in order to block the Kurds, especially the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party which is fighting a separatist war against Ankara,
from entering Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the Gulf has entered a "critical stage" as the
U.S. and Britain are sending more military forces to prepare a
military strike on Iraq in case the U.S. demand for unconditional
and unrestricted U.N. arms inspection in Iraq is not met.
</P>
<P>
It was believed here that with a U.S. military strike on Iraq
seeming more likely, Turkey and Iran, the two Iraqi neighbors, are
anticipating a flood of Iraqi refugees into their borders.
</P>
<P>
The two have expressed serious concern over the situation.

<HEADLINE> Israel Joining Italy for Turkish Chopper Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Italian companies
are jointly working to win Turkey's 3.5-billion-dollar helicopter
gunship bid, local newspaper Daily News said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Aircraft Industries (IAI) proposes to provide the
A-129 chopper with advanced avionics and electronic weapons
integration systems while the Italian Augusta company is to
produce the rest parts of the chopper.
</P>
<P>
This partnership is similar to that Israel had earlier with
Russia to compete for the helicopter bid with the KA-50, said the
defense officials who declined to be named.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the two-side Israeli participation
in the bid aims to increase its possibility of winning the defense
contract which also attracts some other Western arms companies.
</P>
<P>
Israel has got the contracts to help upgrade the aged F-4
and F-5 jets of the Turkish Air Force.
</P>
<P>
The McDonnell Douglas and Boeing Company, Bell-Texon of the
United States, Rostvertol of Russia as well as the Eurocopter
Company will also participate in the competition.
</P>
<P>
Reliable defense sources said that the final decision on the
bid will be announced late this year.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Turkey signed two military cooperation agreements in
1996, enabling Israel to play a more active role in the lucrative
 Turkish defense projects.
</P>
<P>
The rapidly increasing Israeli-Turkish military cooperation has
draw harsh criticism from Iran and the Arab world, which
accuses Ankara of forming a military alliance with the Jewish
state.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Industrial Production Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's industrial
production in the first half of the current 1997-98 fiscal year
increased by 12.2 percent compared to the same period of the last
fiscal year, the independent United News of Bangladesh (UNB)
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi Finance Minister S.A.M.S. Kibria attributed the
growth to the necessary support extended by the government to the
industry, UNB said.
</P>
<P>
Term leading for developing new industrial capacity stood at
102 billion taka (2.22 billion US dollars) at the end of December
1997, representing more than 20 billion taka (434.80 million
dollars) over the year.
</P>
<P>
During the period, the working capital to the industry rose by
15 percent to 100 billion taka (2.17 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Besides, the country's foreign exchange reserves on February 1
this year stood at 1.731 billion dollars, which was "quite
adequate to import foodgrains as much as needed," UNB quoted the
finance minister as saying.

<HEADLINE> Fake Shillings in W. Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A large amount of counterfeit
Uganda Shillihgs appeared in Bushenyi district in western Uganda,
The New Vision reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Amos Tumusiime, the Bushenyi deputy resident district
councilor, and an official in the district security office
confirmed the report to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Most of them are banknotes worth of 1,000 Shillings and 10,000
Shillings (some 1150 Uganda Shillings are the equivelent of One
U.S. dollar). They were first identified two weeks ago, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Intelligence reports noted the flood of the counterfeits
coninsided with the infiltration by rebels of the Allied
Democratic Forces (ADF) into the district. The rebels are trying
to assist their sympathisers to buy votes in local council
elections.
</P>
<P>
Three people have been arrested in connection with the
circulation of the fake notes.
</P>
<P>
ADF is a rebel group acting in the west. It had some 1,500
fighters in its ranks in November 1996 but now the number of the
rebels is dropping to hundreds.

<HEADLINE> HK Equity Funds Register Highest Net Inflows in Late </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong received the
largest net inflows of equity funds in the second half of last
year, which amounted to 188.42 million U.S. dollars, Chairman of
the Hong Kong Investment Funds Association (HKIFA) Peter Lord said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
As to why Hong Kong equity funds managed to attract relatively
strong inflows, Lord said: "To analyze the trend, we need to split
the six-month period into two, i.e. the pre-currency crisis (in
East Asia) and the post-crisis period."
</P>
<P>
"In the former period, or from July to mid October, Hong Kong
equity funds was almost invariably the sector with the highest
monthly net inflows. The net inflows for these four months
accounted for 98 percent of the sector's six-month net total," he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, the Asian financial markets maelstrom had
arrested this trend. In the last two months of 1997, while Hong
Kong equity funds managed to continue to register net inflows,
they just petered out to a trickle -- at 1 - 2 million U.S.
dollars per month, he added.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the sharp drop in net inflows, Lord said: "The
continued deepening of the Asian crisis, and its spill-over effect
on the local economy, as well as signs of asset deflation all
dented the local investment sentiment."
</P>
<P>
The weakening of the investment sentiment was not only felt in
the Hong Kong equity sector, but was experienced by almost all
funds sectors in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Bond funds consistently registered net inflows from July to
December of last year, amounting to 157.39 million U.S. dollars.
Cash funds came third, after the equity and bond funds, in net
sales by attracting new money of 48.37 million U.S. dollars during
the same period.
</P>
<P>
Explaining why cash and bond sectors managed to attract steady
inflows, Lord said: "With the debacle in a number of the Asian
markets, investors understandably were more eager to look for a
safe haven to park their money and to weather the storms."
</P>
<P>
The HKIFA consists of 45 fund management companies as full
overseas members. It has about 40 associate members including
trustees and other professionals which are involved in the
creation and administration of funds.

<HEADLINE> Bank Fraud Rampant in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The bankers Association of
Zambia has said that the problem of fraud has reached an alarming
rate in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Financial Mail Tuesday quoted association Chairman Ian Knapman
as saying that unlike robbery cases, fraud cases have not been
receiving so much attention in the press.
</P>
<P>
The criminals have now become sophisticated and the problem
needs to be addressed seriously, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called for cooperation from banks, government, courts and
customers.
</P>
<P>
The association has been working on the establishment of a
credit reference agency to curtail repeated frauds and create a
data base at the central bank, the Bank of Zambia (BOZ), for
dismissed workers.
</P>
<P>
Police statistics shows that from 1991 to 1995 a total of
15,054 cases were reported countrywide, out of which 2,381
convictions were secured, with 721 acquittals.
</P>
<P>
BOZ Chief Security Commandant Norbert Mumba said that last
year there were attempts to steal close to 3.5 billion Kwacha
(about 2.5 million U.S. Dollars) from the banking sector and of
these attempts, approximately 60 to 70 were staff related, about
1.1 billion Kwacha (about 790,000 dollars) loss was actually
occasioned.
</P>
<P>
"This figure is a gross understatement of both the potential
and real losses as most organizations do not openly declare these
for fear of adverse publicity," Mumba said.

<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- China's first bookstore on the
Internet now allows many Taiwanese to get a look at some mainland
titles for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Authorities on Taiwan have banned the sale of mainland books in
bookstores on the island, but the China Modern Bookstore, which
was established on the Internet last August, provides services
around the world, and Taiwanese can order mainland books over the
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
So far, some 25 percent of orders are coming from Taiwan,
according to the China Publishing Industry Trading Corporation,
the sponsor of the bookstore.

"This is a new means for people across the Straits to increase
exchanges and contacts," says Sun Ou, a company staff member.

<HEADLINE> EU Project to Boost Tourism in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) is to
provide 140 million Kenyan Shillings (about 2.4 million U.S.
Dollars) to help boost Kenya's tourism heavily suffering from
tribal violence, poor infrastructure and El Nino rains.
</P>
<P>
The EU has agreed to finance a project dubbed "National
Tourism Master Plan," which was mapped out by the Kenyan
government with foreign donors in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The plan entails provision of scholarships to strategic
institutions, rehabilitation of the environment, and expanding
some training facilities in the industry, local press reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The project's specific purpose is to support the
establishment of a revised and sustainable tourism base in Kenya,
thus addressing the most structural problems affecting the
country's current tourism development strategy," said the report.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Utalii College will benefit from equipment worth 50
million Shillings (0.86 million Dollars) under the EU fund. The
equipment includes computers, vehicles and expansion of training
facilities.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Signs New Oil Deregulation Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos Tuesday signed into law a new oil deregulation bill that has
been ratified by the two chambers of Congress.
</P>
<P>
"Our public is assured that the Constitutional parameters set
by the Supreme Court are upheld in this law," Ramos said in an
obvious reference to the old oil deregulation law nullified by the
Supreme Court last November.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the signing ceremony, Ramos added that the new
law went further than the court's requirement that fair
competition should be ensured in the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
According to the new law, a single and uniform tariff of three
percent is imposed and collected on both imported crude oil and
refined petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
The new law also gives President Ramos the authority to
determine the date of full deregulation earlier than the
five-month buffer period, except for the liquefied petroleum gas,
kerosene, regular gasoline and other socially sensitive items.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the signing of the new law would pave the
way for the Philippines to exit from the International Monetary
Fund's 35 years of economic tutelage.
</P>
<P>
The deregulation of the oil industry was part of a
comprehensive tax reform the country must complete before quitting
the International Monetary Fund.

<HEADLINE> S. African Disabled Opens Petrol Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A petrol station run by
disabled people, the first of its kind in South Africa, opened
Monday in Durban, KwaZulu Natal Province.
</P>
<P>
The station, owned by the Natal Blind and Deaf Society
(NBADAS), employs six deaf petrol attendants, one partially
sighted supervisor and an able-bodied manager, local press
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Petrol attendants communicate through lip reading and are
armed with note pads to take customer's orders.
</P>
<P>
Without having to say a word, the customer fills in what
petrol he wants, how much he wants, the amount he is going to pay
and whether he needs the oil, water, battery or tyre pressure
checked, the report said.
</P>
<P>
KwaZulu Natal Premier Ben Ngubane participated in the opening
ceremony. He said the Natal Blind and Deaf Society's activities
were a rich design of services which were the epitome of
empowerment.
</P>
<P>
The achievement by the disabled illustrated that empowerment
was about practical things, he said.
</P>
<P>
NBADAS President Arvind Kissoon Singh said the petrol station
was owned by all deaf and blind people and any profits from the
station would be used for empowerment and other programs for
them.

<HEADLINE> Annan Suggests UN Liaison Office in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- While heavy fighting is
continuing in Sierra Leone, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi
Annan has proposed the setting up of a UN liaison office in the
embattled west African country.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council Monday, Annan also
suggested the council send 10 military observers to Sierra Leone
in order to monitor the implementation of the Conakry Peace
Accord, which provides for the restoration of the ousted elected
government on April 22 this year.
</P>
<P>
The proposed liaison office would initially comprise officials
in charge of political, military and humanitarian affairs, and
human rights and information officials could be added if needed,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The team of military observers will mainly be mandated to
assess the situation in Sierra Leone and report to the
international community the development in the implementation of
the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
It will also help build mutual trust among parties concerned
and coordinate moves aimed to restore Sierra Leone's legitimate
government ousted in the coup last May and the delivery of
international relief materials.
</P>
<P>
Deeply concerned over the deteriorating situation in Sierra
Leone, the UN chief called on parties concerned to take positive
actions to earnestly implement the peace accord for an early
restoration of the elected government there.
</P>
<P>
Annan's report followed briefings by the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS) Committee of Five on Sierra Leone to
him and the Security Council late last week.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued by the committee at the end of the
briefings emphasized that the ECOWAS plan still remained the best
framework for the resolution of the crisis in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS has proposed three options to settle the issue by way
of dialogue, sanctions and embargo and the possible use of force
to compel the coup plotters to leave power.
</P>
<P>
A peace accord was signed in Conakry, Guinea last October and
both ECOWAS and UN have imposed sanctions against the junta, but
the military government still refused to quit office on the
agreed date of April 22.
</P>
<P>
Heavy fighting has resumed near the Sierra Leone capital
Freetown since last Thursday between the junta forces and the
ECOWAS peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG chief of staff said here Monday that the
peacekeepers had gained in the battle and were advancing towards
the city center of Freetown.

<HEADLINE> PM: Pakistan, China Share Common on International Fora </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and China share
common interests on international fora and "will always stand on
the side of international justice," Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sharif made the remarks during an interview with a group of
Islamabad-based Chinese correspondents before his departure for
Beijing on a week-long China tour.
</P>
<P>
Sharif noted that peace and development are the two main
subjects of the world today. However, "world peace and development
are still threatened by power politics," he said.
</P>
<P>
"War and poverty still plague people in some parts of the
world," Sharif said, adding that Pakistan and China "will always
stand on the side of international justice."
</P>
<P>
He also said that "we will, as always, adhere to an independent
foreign policy for peace, and hope to live in harmony with people
around the world."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, along with China, "are keen to see the world move
towards multipolarity, a just international order and an equitable
global economic system," the prime minister added.
</P>
<P>
Sharif noted that the Pakistani-Chinese relations have been
exemplary in the past decades and the two countries will enter
into the 21st century with even stronger ties.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to sustain our close and coordinated relations and
work for the betterment and promotion of a just, rational and
equitable international political and economic order," said the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
On Pakistan's foreign policy, Sharif said that the overall
framework of it encompasses two important elements: peace and
security, economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
"In this broad context we are making serious and sincere
efforts to remove the underlying causes of tension in the
sub-continent through my initiative of a dialogue with India," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is "also exerting energetic efforts to bring about a
broad-based government in Afghanistan" and hoped the long-running
Afghan issue will be solved peacefully, said Sharif.

<HEADLINE> Budget Cut Squeezes Israeli Overseas Missions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Israel will close its
embassies in Paraguay and Nepal as well as some other overseas
missions due to financial cut, local newspaper The Jerusalem Post
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Aviv Shir-On as
saying that 15 overseas missions would be shut by the start of the
1999 fiscal year because of budgetary cut.
</P>
<P>
Appearing before the Knesset (Parliament) Foreign Affairs and
Defense Committee, the ministry's Director-General Eitan Bentsur
said the consulates in Toronto of Canada, Philadelphia of the
United States and some others in North America would also likely
be closed.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that protests had been lodged to the ministry
by Jewish community in these areas. He also expressed regret over
the closure of embassy in Katmandu because a number of Israelis
travel to Nepal upon completing their military service.
</P>
<P>
A committee of senior Foreign Ministry officials headed by
Bentsur has been charged with deciding which diplomatic facilities
abroad must be shut this year.
</P>
<P>
Ministry officials believed that the consequences of closing
Toronto consulate would be mitigated due to the geographical
proximity of the embassy in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
As for the U.S., the ministry is contemplating the
establishment of "mega-consulates" which would serve relatively
large sections of the country, instead of conventional facilities
scattered across the continent.

NAIROBI, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Rift Valley Fever infections
have subsided in Kenya as a team of medical experts observed only
14 suspected infections after touring 28 areas in one week, the

(WHO), was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mosquitoes could not multiply in dry seasons, hence the
reduction of infections to both humans and animals, he noted in
Nairobi Monday after touring north-eastern Kenya affected by the
killer disease.
</P>
<P>
However, the international health agencies and local
organizations should continue their efforts to create public
awareness of the disease and its transmission modes, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The people in these affected areas seemed to heed information
that cautioned them, they have stopped slaughtering sick
animals," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Rift Valley Fever has so far claimed almost 400 lives in
Kenya and 80 in southern Somalia, according to the WHO
estimation.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Bars Schools without Toilets from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Sixty-schools in
Zanzibar have been barred from re-opening as most of the students
in the Indian isles resumed their classes on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar Deputy Commissioner for Education, Uledi Juma Wadi,
said on Monday the schools have been running without toilets,
affecting the cleanliness of the environment and the health of
students and teachers, according to the Daily News Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Zanzibar authorities closed down all institutions of
learning in last December following an outbreak of cholera that
killed more than 170 people in the Indian isles.
</P>
<P>
Health officials attributed the sources of the cholera
outbreak, the worst since 1859, to the lack of latrines and
improper disposal of waste.
</P>
<P>
Wadi said the schools will not be permitted to re-open unless
they comply with hygienic standards set by the government.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will take resolute action against any
institutions that have violated health regulations, he said.

<HEADLINE> Law Is Gaining More Respect In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The law in China is getting a
significantly greater amount of respect after 20 years of reforms
and opening-up, Sun Wanzhong, vice-president of the China Law
Society, told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
Improvements in China's legal system have continued in that
time, he said, and the role of law in all aspects is more
recognized not only by high ranking officials but also by ordinary
citizens.
</P>
<P>
Sun, who is a former director of Legislative Affairs Bureau of
the State Council, says that a legal framework suited to the
socialist market economic structure, with more than 1,000 laws and
regulations, has begun to take shape and China recognizes that a
market economy means an economy guided by law, and that better
markets and better investment opportunities come from a better
legal system.
</P>
<P>
China's efforts in this for the past two decades have also
contributed to human rights protection, he said.
</P>
<P>
For more than 2,000 years, morality was regarded as more
important then law in ruling the country. But since its founding
in 1949, New China has been trying to increase awareness of the
law.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Businessmen Threaten to Boycott Loans Payment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Business groups in Mindanao,
one of the three main islands in the Philippines, have threatened
to stop paying their loans until the central bank orders banks to
cease from implementing high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency reported on Tuesday that the
decision was made by business persons in Mindanao during a meeting
held in Davao city in the south recently.
</P>
<P>
The report said the business groups passed a resolution asking
the central bank to stop banks from imposing high interest rates
even when loans were made at a time when rates were only at 16 to
17 percent.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the prime lending rates of commercial banks ranged
from 28 percent to 32 percent as a result of the currency crisis,
allegedly killing the country's business people and the
manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
So far, a total of 21 companies in Metro Manila have applied
for moratorium for loan payment for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of the Philippines is making efforts to reduce
the prime lending rates. The bankers association said its 57
member banks have agreed to lower the rates by one percent per
week in the next two months.

<HEADLINE> China's Energy Development Goals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- China has set a target of
meeting energy resource demands by the year 2010 to guarantee
rapid economic and social development, according to a senior State
Planning Commission official.
</P>
<P>
China will establish an energy resource storage system and have
rational regional distribution in the coming years and will work
on improving science and technology and the harmonious development
of energy resources and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
China's energy development plans still call for a series of
energy conservation policies, and it will give equal attention to
exploitating energy resources and conserving energy.
</P>
<P>
Energy development will focus on power and be based on coal,
with an expansion of petroleum, gas and nuclear power and
renewable energy resources.
</P>
<P>
Before the turn of the century, China's coal sector will shift
its focus westward and a greater effort will be made to expand the
Shenfu and Dongsheng coalfields. In petroleum, priority will be
given to oil and gas exploitation in the western part of China and
in offshore areas. There will be energy-supply bases nationwide,
with Shanxi, Shaanxi, Heilongjiang, and Guizhou provinces, and the
western part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region as major coal
suppliers. The Daqing and Shengli oilfields will remain the
country's main oil sources.
</P>
<P>
The country will speed up development of hydroelectric power
stations in river valleys and the power stations near coal
mines. The upper reaches of the Yellow River and the middle and
lower reaches of the Yangtze River will be used to supply
hydroelectric power nationwide. It will also look into developing
geothermal, wind, solar, and tidal energy.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, China will balance supply and demand in
energy resources by the year 2000, and the current net export of
23 million tons of coal will increase by the end of the century,
but net imports of oil will see no rapid increase.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that by the turn of the century, the total
consumption of unrenewable energy resources will be equal to 2.07
billion tons of coal, and coal output will be 1.45 billion tons
and oil and gas production, 150 million tons and 25 billion
cu.m. respectively.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Resettlement Needs $3.2m a Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Resettlement needs 3.2 million
U.S. Dollars in Zambia per year, Financial Mail reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The local weekly newspaper quoted deputy minister in the
vice-president office David Saviye as saying that the Department
of Resettlement requires an annual budget of 4.5 billion Kwacha
(about 3.2 million dollars) to manage 58 resettlement schemes
across the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that since the government started the resettlement
program in 1991 it has settled 6,000 families comprising 37,000
family members.
</P>
<P>
The government makes land previously designated as state land
available to the needy Zambians who want to be resettled to earn
a living, he said.
</P>
<P>
He described the program as successful because the
resettlement schemes have a concentration of social services
including communal water supply, health centers and access roads
for easy delivery of agricultural inputs and farm produce to the
markets.
</P>
<P>
The mechanism of making land available to the needy Zambians
create opportunities for self-employment and enable them to
contribute to agricultural development, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, 30,000 applications have been
received and the government has issued 900 title deeds and
recommended another 1,500.

<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Sergei Fedorov was caught by
surprise when he received invitation to play in Russian ice hockey
team at the Nagano Olympic Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
"I am just glad to come at the last minute and play for Team
Russia," he said at press conference on Tuesday. "I believe it will be
highly intense games. Participants and fans will have a lot of fun."
</P>
<P>
Fedorov was invited to play after an injury to N.Y. Ranger Alexei
Kovalev opened a spot on the Russian's team roster. "It took me 12
hours to think it over," said Fedorov. "I am excited and pleased it's
happening and I'm proud to represent my country."
</P>
<P>
Having not yet played in the NHL this season, Fedorov was
optimistic about his future with the league. "It's very simple. I'd
really like to regain my career with the NHL. I don't know how it's
going to be done, but at some point I would like to return and play
for the NHL." But right now, his focus remains on the upcoming games
and representing his country.
</P>
<P>
Fedorov noted he has undergone intense training with a concerted
emphasis on speed. "I've been specifically working out the month of
January and half of December because I thought I would be playing in
the National Hockey League," said Fedorov who is known as one of the
fastest skaters in the League. "I've been skating the last three weeks
very intense on the ice, an hour and a half, couple hours a time.
Obviously, off the ice an hour and a half, two hours, all kinds of
drills were included... I've been concentrating on my speed."
</P>
<P>
When being asked why he was not on the original Russian team, he
said:"Bottom line is I'm here to represent Russia. It doesn't matter
whose choice it was. I'm just so anxious to get back on the ice and
play a competitive game."

KAMPALA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Gray parrots, a wild bird
living mainly in Ssese Islands in Lake Victoria, southern Uganda,
are on sale in pet shops in Dubai, a report from the Middle East
city said.
</P>
<P>
Gray parrot is not the only wildlife on sale in the Middle
East city. Ugandan bred rabbits are also on high demand at pet
shops in the city. The retail price for an Ugandan bred rabbit
cost 1,500 Dirhams (some 391 U.S. Dollars), comparing a gray
parrot for 1,000 Dirhams (some 261 U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Another rare bird, the white colored cockatoo, costs 1,500
Dirhams (some 1,304 U.S. Dollars) a head.
</P>
<P>
All these African wildlives are smuggled by individuals
despite ban from Ugandan authorities. Uganda is a country which
signed in the international trade in endangered species
convention which imposed a world wide ban on animal and bird
trafficking.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, U.S. Start Talks on F-15 Jet Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and the United States
have started talks on Turkey's plan to buy 20 to 40 U.S.-made F-15
fighters, local newspaper Daily News reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted senior officials from the Turkish General
Staff, who spoke on condition of anonymity, as saying that a
visiting delegation from the Boeing Company has started the
discussion with the Turkish side on the deal.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Defense Industry Undersecretary and the General Staff
have set up special working teams respectively to follow the
project.
</P>
<P>
"F-15 Eagle jets are planned to replace the Turkish Air
Force's aged warplanes under the country's tactical and
strategical plans for the 21st century," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believed that Turkey's decision to buy F-15 jets
was in response to a deal between Greece and the United States to
sell 40 U.S.-made F-16 fighters to Athens.
</P>
<P>
The double-engine F-15 jet, 60 million U.S. dollars for each,
is equipped with more advanced electronic guiding and more
powerful fire systems than the single-engine F-16, according to
defense experts.
</P>
<P>
The United States had imposed an arms embargo on Turkey on the
ground of Ankara's poor human rights record, but it was lifted
late last year.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, two traditional rivals, have long been at
odds over a bevy of issues, including airspace limits over the
Aegean Sea, the sea-bed mineral rights as well as the protracted
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have been importing advanced weapons,
especially warplanes, from the United States and other Western
countries in an effort to gain the upper hand in the Aegean and
Cyprus.

<P>
NAIROBI, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Production of tea, Kenya's
leading foreign exchange earner, fell 14 percent last year to
220.72 million kilograms from 257.16 million kilograms in 1996,
local press reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Leading brokerage house Africa Tea Brokers (ATB) said drought
in the first half of last year and heavy rains since October
blamed on the El Nino weather phenomenon adversely affected the
tea field.
</P>
<P>
Bad roads had also complicated transport to markets, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
However, "the (tea) crop figure for the month of December 1997
has been announced at 25,875,373 kg, showing an increase of
2,366,910 kg or 10 percent over the same month in 1996," ATB
said.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Musalia Mudavadi said last week that tea
output would probably increase to bumper levels this year because
recent rains had been followed by a spell of dry weather which
helped the faster growth of green tea.
</P>
<P>
"Rainfall continues in most tea-growing areas but lately there
have been longer periods of drier weather. Temperatures are
warmer and (tea) growth continues vigorously," said the brokers.

<P>
In an interview with a group of Chinese correspondents based in
Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan, Sharif said Pakistan and China
have close cooperation in economic and commercial fields, and this
cooperative relationship will be further strengthened in the years
ahead.
</P>
<P>
Sharif is scheduled to leave for China on a week-long visit
Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister noted that in recent years many significant
projects between Pakistan and China had been completed. Several
other projects are in various stages of completion, he said.
</P>
<P>
"These projects, we believe, are very beneficial for the
development of Pakistan's economy particularly as these involve
transfer of technology, and technical know-how," said Sharif.
</P>
<P>
The government led by the Pakistan Muslim League (N) has
announced several economic and fiscal measures to develop the
country's infrastructure, industrial, and service sectors since it
came to power after a landslide victory in the elections in
February 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government has recently announced a new
investment policy which offers attractive incentives for both
foreign and domestic investors.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that Chinese corporations and companies would take
advantage of these incentives and join hands with Pakistani
entrepreneurs," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
"This would obviously be a leap-forward in economic cooperation
between Pakistan and China," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said that during his visit to China, several concrete
proposals, including building roads and refineries and thermal and
hydropower projects, would be offered to China.
</P>
<P>
Sharif highly appreciated China's reform and open policies, and
the modernization drive initiated by late Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping who, Sharif said, was "a great world leader and a great
man of vision."
</P>
<P>
"China has embarked on the crucial second phase of economic
development and modernization with an eye on the 21st century and
a more influential role in the international community," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said the 15th National Congress of the Chinese Communist
Party held in last September has decided to focus on economic
development and restructuring. "These are steps in the right
direction," he added.

<HEADLINE> Africa Urged to Map out Industrial Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Sub-Saharan Africa is urged
to map out a new industrial strategy as its industrialization has
been deeply unbalanced with six countries contributing almost
three-quarters of Manufacturing Value Added (MVA).
</P>
<P>
While South Africa alone accounts for 58 percent of MVA, the
five next most industrialized states -- Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire,
Kenya, Nigeria and Zimbabwe -- account for 16.5 percent, says a
Newslink Africa writer in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, four-fifths of Sub-Saharan Africa's industrial
production is classified as low-technology and the shares of
capital intensive, hi-tech sectors have declined over the years.
</P>
<P>
Structural adjustment in the region, sponsored by the World
Bank after the Cold War, has not succeeded in creating the right
policies for industrial development through the private sector
and new global partnerships, the writer noted.
</P>
<P>
Thus the crucial challenge facing African government policy
makers and aid agencies is to map out a better industrialization
strategy for the next century.
</P>
<P>
Such a strategy should aim to develop Africa-generated
industry, promote regional industrial relationships and
strengthen agro-industrial linkages across the continent.
</P>
<P>
However, African leaders have been aware of the importance of
such a new strategy and reached agreement that without balanced
industrial progress, Africa will be left behind in the race for
development.
</P>
<P>
They adopted in June summit of the Organization of African
Unity the Harare Declaration on African Industrialization, vowing
to overcome economic and social constraints and achieve a greater
stake in the global marketplace.
</P>
<P>
This shows a good political will to the creation of new
strategy but it takes time for the continent to go on the right
track of a balanced geography industrialized structure, the
writer says.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan wants to have
stronger bonds of friendship with China, Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif said here Tuesday before leaving for China on a
week-long visit.
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to entering into the 21st century with even
stronger bonds of friendship. We aim to further deepen our
understanding in the years ahead," Sharif said in an interview
with a group of Chinese correspondents based in this capital city.
He is scheduled to leave for China in the evening.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said his China tour "is aimed at reiterating
our traditional friendship with China, discussing bilateral
relations and exploring new avenues of economic cooperation."
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan and China enjoy long standing ties of friendship.
Exchange of high level visits is a regular feature of our
relations," said Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited Pakistan in December 1996
while the president of Pakistan paid a return visit to China in
April 1997, Sharif said, adding "my visit (to China) forms part of
these high level contacts."
</P>
<P>
Sharif, who will visit China for the fifth time, expressed his
satisfaction with the sound development of the bilateral relations
between Pakistan and China during the past decades.
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply satisfied with our bilateral relations which
encompass all fields," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of the diplomatic ties in 1951,
Pakistani-Chinese relations have progressed on friendly basis to
the mutual benefit of the two nations, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It has been long and steady friendship. This friendship has
never wavered despite vicissitude of time and dramatic changes in
the world scenario," he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister noted that Pakistan and China helped and
supported each other on a number of occasions.
</P>
<P>
"We deeply appreciate China's unstinted support to Pakistan on
critical junctures and its significant contribution towards
Pakistan's goal of self-reliance," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan has also done its bit by standing-by China on issues
which vitally concern her such as Tibet, Taiwan and human rights,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan and China will be celebrating the golden
jubilee of their diplomatic relations in 2001, "We are confident
that in that year our exemplary friendship would be enriched even
further."
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the current world trend, he said, "We will
be closely working towards promotion of peace and cooperation and
economic and social growth not only in our region but also in the
world at large."

<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Roland Silva, chairman of
UNESCO's Council of International Historical Sites and Ruins,
arrived in Beijing yesterday to do a study of the Summer Palace
and the Temple of Heaven, whose names were submitted by the
Chinese government for inclusion on UNESCO's World Heritage List.
</P>

The Summer Palace was built in the mid-18th century,
burned by British and French soldiers in 1860, and rebuilt in
1886. Its buildings and lakes are part of China's largest imperial
garden, which attracts from 40 to 50 million tourists a year.
</P>
<P>
The Temple of Heaven, in the southern part of Beijing, was
where 22 emperors of the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911)
dynasties held services to pray for a good harvest, and is an
important example of an ancient sacrificial structure.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's Great Wall and Forbidden City are two of the 19

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's Human Rights
Commission (HRC) is investigating complaints of alleged "slave
conditions and salaries" being offered to local workers by a
South African chain store in Lusaka, according to The Post.
</P>
<P>
The paper today quoted Lavu Mulimba, HRC chairman for
information, education and communications as saying in a
statement released here Monday that the commission has decided to
investigate the matter following several complaints by the staff
of Shoprite Chechers.
</P>
<P>
HRC has received complaints from a number of workers at the
chain store "alleging the existence of near slave labour
conditions and treatment not benefiting the dignity of human
beings," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It said the HRC is appealing to members of the public to make
submissions on the allegations against the chain store's
management.
</P>
<P>
Shoprite Checkers, the biggest chain store and supermarket in
Lusaka, recently came under attack from the Commerce, Trade and
Industry Minister Enoch Kavindele over the alleged slave
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Shoprite Checkers managing director Mauritz Alberts denied the
minister's claims and challenged him to prove his charges.
</P>
<P>
Earlier local reports also said that the South African chain
store offers its staff an average monthly pay of 40,000 Kwacha
(about 28 U.S. Dollars) while they should earn a maximum pay of
60,000-70,000 Kwacha every month in accordance with the local
labour law.

<HEADLINE> Saudis not to Allow Use of Bases to Strike Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia refused to
allow the U.S. to use its air bases to strike Iraq, Saudi Deputy
Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Prince Sultan Ibn
Abdul-Aziz said Monday in Saudi Red Sea coastal city Jeddah.
</P>
<P>
His statement, the first made by a Saudi official publicly
regarding the Iraq-U.N. standoff, came after a short visit of the
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen to the kingdom, Kuwait News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Prince Sultan said this decision was taken when the U.S. forces
launched strike against Iraq in 1996 in retaliation for violation
of a ban on the entry of Iraqi military to the Kurdish security
zone in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia categorically refused the U.S. request to use
Saudi bases to strike Iraq at that time when the U.S. threatened
to attack Iraq for its troops incursion into the U.N. protected
safe haven for the Kurds in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is hosting about 4,000 American troops.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Prince Sultan denied that the U.S. asked for using
Saudi air bases to strike Iraq. Cohen also denied, before ending
his visit in Kuwait, that the U.S. has requested using Saudi bases
for a possible military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"It is not my intent to make such a request because we don't
think it's necessary," said Cohen.
</P>
<P>
So far the U.S. and Britain have amassed a fleet of 17
warships including four aircraft carriers and more than 400
aircraft in the Gulf region in preparation to launch a strike
against Iraq in case the U.S. demand for unconditional and
unrestricted U.N. arms inspection in Iraq is not met.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prince Sultan reiterated his country's support for
the U.N. Security Council resolutions and called on "the Iraqi
ruler to abide by these resolutions."

<HEADLINE> Australia Supports U.S.-Led Attack Against Iraq: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Australia would contribute to
any U.S.-led military operation against Iraq, but still hopes a
military action would not be necessary, Prime Minister John Howard
said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"If it does become necessary for a United States-led coalition
to use force, then Australia has decided it will make a
contribution to that effort," Howard was quoted by the Australian
Associated Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
Howard said he would contact U.S. President Bill Clinton
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister made the announcement after a cabinet
meeting Tuesday to discuss a weekend request by Clinton for
Australia's support for the proposed military operation against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"I ask the Australian people to understand the reasons for the
government's decision, to see it in the context of our national
interest and to give its support to the government's decision,"
Howard said.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic efforts would be intensified, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We fervently hope that military action will not be necessary
and we will continue all of the diplomatic efforts that have been
undertaken and they will be intensified over coming days," Howard
said.
</P>
<P>
When asked how many people would be committed to a potential
Gulf conflict, Howard said: "We're looking here at about 250
maximum of Australian personnel ... the special units of about 100
to 110."
</P>
<P>
Many countries, including permanent members of the United
Nations Security Council such as Russia, France and China, as well
as Middle East nations are opposed to military actions against
Iraq.

<P>
Rabbi Arthur Schneier, president of the Appeal of Conscience
Foundation, Archbishop Theodore McCarrick of the Roman Catholic
Archdiocese of Newark, and the Rev. Don Argue, president of the
National Association of Evangelicals, are here on an 18-day visit
as guests of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The three religious leaders, in describing the religious state
of affairs in the US, said that religious faith is very important
in American society.
</P>
<P>
Professor Zhuo Xinping, of CASS's Institute of World Religions,
told the visitors that Chinese scholars prefer to study religious
issues as a part of culture to avoid possible political and
ideological obstructions.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Dai Kangsheng of CASS said that there has been great
progress in religion in China since the country initiated the
policy of reforms and opening up, and, even though there are still
some problems, religions in China has had a golden period in the
past two decades, and there are now more than 100 million
Buddhists, Taoists, Christians, Moslems, or believers in other
faiths in China.
</P>
<P>
He said that the historical, cultural, and other background of
ethnic groups should be considered in studying religion in China
to reach a more objective conclusion.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese scholars answered questions about religious freedom
in China, and Rabbi Schneier said that he hopes to get Chinese
books on religion published in the US.
</P>
<P>
China's only national center for academic research on religion
is the Institute of World Religions, which was founded in 1964 and
has 63 researchers specializing in religion.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Bankers Association to Cap Yields on Deposits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Bankers Association of the
Philippines (BAP) confirmed Tuesday that it had agreed to cap
yields on special deposits to only one percent over Treasury-Bill
rates.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it is urging some member banks to refrain from
giving out high interest rates on time deposits, saying this only
triggers the pushing up of lending rates in the market.
</P>
<P>
BAP President Deogracia Vistan said these moves are expected to
lower cost of funds and help reduce prime lending rates which
soared to as high as 31 percent due to the currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
They were also in response to the threat of central bank
governor Gabriel Singson who said he would control interest rates
by regulation if banks continue ignoring his warnings to lower
these rates.
</P>
<P>
Vistan said he had asked the banks to lower prime lending rates
by one percent per week, starting this week, until the target of
25 percent is finally attained.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the 57 member banks under the BAP have already
voluntarily agreed to lower their lending rates in due time, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"This is one way of policing ourselves and that we even asked
the help of the central bank to enforce this move," he said.
</P>
<P>
Vistan added that the prime lending rates could even be lower
if the rates of Treasury-Bills are reduced to acceptable levels.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Details Added Chinese Consultations With Gulf States On Iraq Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- China's Assistant Foreign
Minister Ji Peiding met this morning with the ambassadors of Gulf
Co-operation Council (GCC) states Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United
Arab Emirates, Oman, Bahrain, and Qatar to discuss the current
weapons inspection crisis in Iraq, and afterwards met with the
Iraqi ambassador.
</P>
<P>
Ji told the ambassadors that Chinese President Jiang Zemin is
deeply concerned about the worsening situation of the weapon
inspection crisis in Iraq and that China always believes that
disputes should be resolved by peaceful means and it is not in
favor of resolving the crisis by force.
</P>
<P>
China holds that resorting to force can only result in serious
casualties and will intensify disagreements and even lead to more
serious consequences, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that this does not conform to the desire of the
countries in the region to restore peace and development as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
China believes that Iraq should implement relevant UN
resolutions completely and earnestly and that it should fully
cooperate with the UN and carry out its commitments, Ji said.
</P>
<P>
But, weapon inspections should not drag on indefinitely and
Iraq's progress in implementing relevant UN resolutions should be
assessed objectively and in time.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi is a member of the UN and its sovereignty and security
concerns should be respected, and humanitarian issues of the Iraqi
people also need to be settled as soon as possible, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China, as a permanent member of the UN
Security Council and a friend of the countries concerned, does not
want to see a further worsening of the situation and has made all
kinds of positive efforts to resolve the current crisis by
peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen, in a discussion with US Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright over the phone and in a message to Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tareq Aziz, clearly stated China's position and appealed
the two sides to adopt a restrained and flexible attitude to ease
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The GCC ambassadors thanked the Chinese government for the
briefing and expressed appreication of China's objective and fair
position and its efforts toward a peaceful settlement of the
crisis. They noted that their countries are willing to continue to
maintain close contacts with China and improve coordination.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi ambassador said that the Iraqi government thanks the
Chinese government for its positive efforts toward a peaceful
settlement of the Iraqi crisis.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
formally asked New Zealand for assistance in the event of military
action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The request came at a meeting between NZ Foreign Minister Don
McKinnon and U.S. Ambassador to New Zealand Josiah Beeman earlier
on Tuesday, Radio NZ reported.
</P>
<P>
McKinnon said New Zealand has been asked to join a coalition of
countries which will provide support for multinational military
action if necessary.
</P>
<P>
He said the request will be considered by the ministers
concerned in the next few days and discussed by the cabinet next
Monday.
</P>
<P>
But he hoped that the United Nations rather than the United
States will take the lead in action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that New Zealand will offer a low-level
contribution as it did during the Gulf war.

<HEADLINE> NZ Urges Regional Support for Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Treasurer
Winston Peters has told a business audience in Sydney that the
whole region must continue to help Asian countries restore
financial stability.
</P>
<P>
Peters was quoted by a TVNZ report Tuesday as saying the exact
impact of the Asian financial crisis on New Zealand remains
uncertain as it is still unfolding.
</P>
<P>
He said some sectors in New Zealand have already been hard hit,
such as tourism and forestry, but the market-led depreciation of
the NZ dollar will raise the competitiveness of New Zealand's
exports.
</P>
<P>
The treasurer pointed out that the Asian crisis has not changed
New Zealand's basic fiscal strategy, with running surpluses and
repaying debt still at the core.
</P>
<P>
But he said it will be irresponsible not to consider all
possible reconfigurations to preserve the health of the economy
and the operating surplus.
</P>
<P>
"As in all businesses and occupations, if plans need to be
changed by emerging events, they will be," he stated.

<HEADLINE> Baby In Controversial Heart Transplant Dies in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A Rome baby, who battled 11 days
for life after a controversial heart transplant, died Monday.
</P>
<P>
Doctors in Rome's Bambin Gesu Hospital said that Maurizio died
of an infection brought on by an insufficient blood supply to the
intestines.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the hospital thanked the parents of the donor
child, Gabriele, who was born without a brain in Turin on January
14 this year.
</P>
<P>
Gabriele's heart was removed and flown the following day to
Rome where it was transplanted to Maurizio, who was born a few
hours earlier with life-threatening heart defects.
</P>
<P>
Gabriele was expected to live only a few days, but he surprised
many by surviving until January 29 amid a flurry of bio-ethical
debates and criticism of the parents.
</P>
<P>
Before Gabriele's death, his parents received hate mail because
the media reported they had allowed the hospital to induce labor
despite knowing that the child had no brain in order to donate his
organs.
</P>
<P>
It was later learned that they had refused an abortion in
obedience to the Catholic Church's ban on abortion.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference on the day of their son's death, the
parents showed a letter from Pope John Paul II comforting them for
refusing to submit to an abortion.

this year.
</P>
<P>
Priority is being given to infrastructure, reorganizing and

overseas-backed enterprises a key problem to solve this year in a
bid to improve the investment environment, and will pay attention

<HEADLINE> Holyfield Would Fight Bean before Lewis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Heavyweight champion Evander
Holyfield said Monday he would rather fight Vaughn Bean than
Englishman Henry Akinwande in his next mandatory title defense
before the end of May.
</P>
<P>
"If I had my choice it would be Vaughn Bean," Holyfield said of
defending his International Boxing Federation (IBF) crown against
its number one ranked challenger.
</P>
<P>
Akinwande is the top-ranked World Boxing Association (WBA)
challenger but Holyfield does not like the idea of defending his
WBA crown against him because it would raise a conflict for their
mutual trainer Don Turner.
</P>
<P>
Holyfield was honored as the Boxer of the Year at the ESPY
awards show at Radio City Music Hall.
</P>
<P>
Holyfield has not fought since stopping Michael Moorer to unify
the WBA and IBF titles in November. Last June, Holyfield beat Mike
Tyson in their rematch when the former heavyweight champion was
disqualified for twice biting him in the ear.
</P>
<P>
Holyfield plans on getting back to the gym starting Tuesday in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
While negotiations for a unification fight with World Boxing
Council (WBC) champion Lennox Lewis fell apart last month over
money, Holyfield said that is the fight he really wants.
</P>
<P>
"The best fight for me is definitely Lennox," Holyfield said
of the Englishman who defends his title against American Shannon
Briggs on March 28 in Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
Holyfield is still optimistic that a fight with Lewis can
still be made for later this year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Firm Lowers Semiconductor Market Projections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS Angeles, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Amid the continued
financial crisis in Asia, an American market research firm has cut
a preliminary forecast for this year's worldwide semiconductor
market by 15 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dataquest Corp., based in San Jose, California, has lowered its
previous forecast of 175 billion dollars to 160 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The volatile situation in Asia has caused Dataquest to
reevaluate all the markets within the semiconductor industry,"
said the company whose formal forecast will be completed in April.
</P>
<P>
"In 1998, worldwide electronic equipment production is likely
to decline from our previous forecast of 1,009 billion dollars to
953 billion dollars," sad Dataquest, adding that it means that
sector will grow only about 3 percent instead of the 9 percent
previously forecast.
</P>
<P>
Dataquest said the worldwide semiconductor market is likely to
decline about 10 billion dollars from its earlier forecast "solely
because of the decrease in electronic equipment production."
</P>
<P>
In addition, the firm said, the semiconductor forecast could be
further reduced by another 3 billion dollars to 5 billion dollars
due to the potential lower costs of dynamic random access memory
(DRAM) manufacturing in South Korea and the devaluation of the
won. Lower cost of DRAM manufacturing would result in its lower
market prices.
</P>
<P>
The net result of the two factors -- 10 billion dollars and 5
billion dollars is that the 1998 semiconductor could be as low as
160 billion dollars, resulting in a growth of 7 percent versus its
previous forecast of 17 percent growth, Dataquest said.
</P>
<P>
Throughout 1997, the firm said, DRAMs were priced at a level
near their manufacturing cost, a minimum that must be followed if
antidumping measures are to be avoided.
</P>
<P>
Dataquest sees a continuing overcapacity in 1998, forcing
manufacturers to continue efforts to keep prices low to win the
fight for their share of their customers' business.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Ornamental Fish Exports Up in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has made 370 million
rupees (about 6 million U.S. dollars) from ornamental fish exports
in 1997, a 19-percent increase over 1996, the Sri Lanka Customs
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The customs said the growth in export earnings was mainly due
to the expansion of the existing markets in the importing
countries as well as access to new markets in other countries.
</P>
<P>
Export value of live tropical fish was 310 million rupees (5
million dollars) in 1996, compared with 28 million rupees (451,613
dollars) in 1985.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade there has been a significant increase in the
market for Sri Lankan tropical fish, particularly in Europe and
the United States, according to customs officials.
</P>
<P>
About 75 percent of the fish exported from Sri Lanka were
marine fish varieties, such as invertebrates.
</P>
<P>
At present nearly 70 percent of the ornamental fish exports
come from collections from the sea and the balance from
aquiculture, the officials said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 10 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will increase its
international flight charges by an average of 15.2 percent
beginning on February 15.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean Ministry of Construction and Transportation
announced Tuesday that Korean Air Lines and Asiana Airlines will
boost their charges by 5 percent on Seoul-Europe routes and 10
percent on Seoul-Asia routes.
</P>
<P>
The two South Korean-flagged airlines will also raise their
charges by 15 percent on Seoul-Japan routes, 25 percent on
Seoul-Oceania routes and 30 percent on Seoul-North America routes.
</P>
<P>
The Seoul-Beijing flight fare will rise to 260,800 won (about
180 dollars) from 236,400 won (162 dollars) while the price from
Seoul to Hong Kong will grow to 416,800 won (288 dollars) from
379,900 won (262 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the price rise to the won's sharp
depreciation against the U.S. dollar, caused by the current
financial crisis ailing the country.
</P>
<P>
Since late 1997, South Korea has been in serious financial woes
triggered by corporate failures and bad loans of financial
institutions.

<P>
COLOMBO, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Dalada Maligawa (Tooth
Relic Temple) in the central mountain city of Kandy reopened
Tuesday to Sri Lankan pilgrims after a closure of two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The temple was closed on January 25 after a massive truck bomb
attack by Tamil rebels on that day.
</P>
<P>
The entrance, outer wall, roof and some other parts of the
temple sustained extensive damage due to the explosion, which
killed at least 17 people and injured many others.
</P>
<P>
The decision to keep the temple open for pilgrims was taken at
a meeting of the Dalada Maligawa Advisory Committee recently.
</P>
<P>
Rehabilitation work of the temple has been going on.
</P>
<P>
President Chandrika Kumaratunga has allocated 20 million rupees
(322,581 U.S. dollars) from her presidential fund for the
reconstruction project.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has set up a Dalada Maligawa
Restoration Fund, which collects donations from people for the
reconstruction of the temple.
</P>
<P>
The reconstruction work is estimated to take about two years to
complete.
</P>
<P>
The temple, where Sri Lankan Buddhists go to pay their homage
to the sacred tooth relic believed to be belonging to the Buddha,
is regarded as one of the most important symbols of the country.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Party Leader: Readjust Investment Structure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 10 (Xinhua) -- General Secretary of the
Vietnamese Communist Party Le Kha Phieu said Monday Vietnam should
readjust investment structure, pouring capital and technology into
projects of high economic returns, Vietnamese newspapers reported.
</P>
<P>
The Party leader made the remark when addressing over 1,000
veteran revolutionaries here.
</P>
<P>
Phieu admitted that "there remained shortcomings in
implementing resolutions of the party and the government,"
stressing that the party and the government "would exert efforts
to overcome those weaknesses."
</P>
<P>
The party leader stressed the need to boost agricultural
production in food, livestock breeding, forests and fishery.
</P>
<P>
He noted that developing agriculture would ensure the people's
well-being, and national political, social and economic stability.
</P>
<P>
Phieu said the fourth plenum of the Communist Party Central
Committee stressed the need to mobilize and bring internal
strength and resources into full play while effectively using
international support and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said investment should be made to increase competitiveness
of Vietnam-made goods, especially export items, and should not be
put into projects that are not urgent and require huge investment
and long period of implementation.
</P>
<P>
To fulfill the above-mentioned tasks, the party leader said, it
is necessary to boost people's right to democracy and mastery.

BUCHAREST, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Romania's economy slumped
throughout the year 1997 with the gross domestic product (GDP)
decreasing 6.6 percent, a senior government official said Monday.

Constantin Chirca, deputy chairman of the national statistical
commission, said Romania's GDP last year amounted to 30 billion
U.S. dollars, with per capita of 1,330 dollars.
</P>
<P>

percent and during the first 11 months, trade deficit was narrowed
by 528 million U.S. dollars over a year ago.

He also said the country faced a high inflationary pressure
with inflation reaching 151.4 percent in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Pilot's Error Called Cause Philippines' Air Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The pilot's error rather than
mechanical troubles may have caused the Philippines' worst air
disaster on February 2 in which 104 people were killed, local TV
SNN reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said Air Transportation Office officials had made
sure that the ill-fated DC-9 plane had met safety standards before
taking off. It said it might be the pilot's error that resulted in
the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
However, the actual cause of the accident is still to be
decided by experts. The black box of the plane, which was
retrieved by rescuers Monday morning, is expected to be sent to
Canada for its manufacturers there to determine the cause of the
disaster.
</P>
<P>
The black box, formally called the flight data recorder,
contains important information including air speed, flying
direction, engine power and rate of descent of the plane before
the crash.
</P>
<P>
Rescue operations are continuing the mountain area in Misamis
Oriental Province where the plane crashed. So far a total of 73
cadaver bags containing body parts and personal belongings of the
victims have been brought down from the site.
</P>
<P>
Forensic experts from the Philippines and European countries
have identified around 30 of the victims. Some of the mangled body
parts have begun to decay because of the weather.
</P>
<P>
Emotional relatives of the victims are still waiting in Cagayan
de Oro city which the plane was bounding for when it went down.

<HEADLINE> Vegetable Prices Rise as Sri Lanka Tightens Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Vegetable prices will continue
to soar as security precautions in and around the Sri Lankan
capital of Colombo have affected vegetable transportation into the
city, a local market expert said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Police restriction on the number of trucks entering the city
has resulted in a decline in vegetable supply, said T. A.
Dharmaratna, head of the Marketing and Research Division of the
Kobbekaduwa Agricultural Research and Training Institute (KARTI).
</P>
<P>
Dharmaratna said one kilogram of carrot was sold in Colombo at
84 rupees (1.35 U.S. dollars) while people in other parts of the
country could get the same amount of carrot for around 50 rupees
(0.81 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Papaya, a popular fruit, costs around 45 rupees (0.73 dollars)
per kilogram, 50 percent up from weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
About two or three weeks ago, people could buy a kilogram of
leek at around 50 rupees. However, they now need to pay some 90
rupees (1.45 dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to a study conducted by the KARTI, prices of almost
all vegetables, when compared with last year, have gone up. The
price of carrot has jumped by 163 percent from the 32 rupees per
kilogram last year.
</P>
<P>
Dharmaratna blamed poor production as the major factor leading
to the high prices.
</P>
<P>
However, due to the security measures imposed during the
country's Golden Jubilee celebrations in the past few weeks,
vegetable supplies dropped further.
</P>
<P>
The authorities have restricted the number of trucks entering
or moving around Colombo for fear of possible infiltration of
rebel suicide bombers.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) often
use truck bombs for suicide attacks on government targets.

<HEADLINE> More Chinese High School Students to Go Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- China plans to sent more high
school students abroad for the 1998/99 school year, today's
China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Educational Association for International Exchange
(CEAIE) and AFS Intercultural Programs, the world's largest and
longest-standing student exchange program, are discussing the
specific number of Chinese students to be sent to 10 host
countries, said a Chinese official.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in history, China sent 28 high school
students last year to foreign countries including the United
States, Switzerland, Norway, Germany, Italy, Australia, and New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The action was taken under a program jointly sponsored by AFS
Intercultural Programs and the CEAIE under the State Education
Commission, aiming to let Chinese students learn more about life
and culture of other countries, told CEAIE official Wu Zaofeng.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that candidates must be students in senior high schools
anywhere across the country. Students selected must pass an
interview with the AFS and the CEAIE.
</P>
<P>
Candidates must have an enquiring mind, be keen to examine
their nature and value system, and be able to withstand the
difficulties of being absorbed into a different culture, AFS
International President Richard Spencer was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Students are not supposed to gain significant academic
achievements, but the intercultural experience and maturity will
certainly boost their chance of entering universities after
returning to China, Spencer said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Campaign War Starts in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Election fever is gripping the
Philippines as the campaign period officially started Tuesday for
the presidential contenders to promote their candidacies in the
country's May 11 general elections.
</P>
<P>
As many as 73 persons had filed their certificates of candidacy
for president with the Commission on Elections (Comelec) as of
Monday, the deadline for the filing of candidacy for national
posts, according to the poll body.
</P>
<P>
Aside from dozens of "nuisance" candidates, there are nearly a
dozen "serious" ones supported by various political parties. But
it is widely believed that the field for the May polls is
dominated by three contenders -- Vice President Joseph Estrada,
Speaker of the House of Representatives Jose de Venecia and Manila
Mayor Alfredo Lim.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, a long-time retired action film star, enjoys
popularity among ordinary voters because he used to play Robin
Hood-style toughies in his younger days.
</P>
<P>
He has led many opinion polls since early last year although
some businessmen were reportedly concerned over his win in the
coming polls because of his pro-poor image and alleged lack of
experience in dealing with economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
Another major candidate is de Venecia, the standard-bearer
picked up by President Fidel Ramos for the ruling Lakas-NUCD
party. Ramos' support, the powerful state machine and the ruling
party's nationwide grassroots network give de Venecia a
considerable advantage over his rivals.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, one of the most popular politicians in the country, is
barred by the constitution from running for re-election and must
step down on June 30 when his term ends.
</P>
<P>
The start of the campaign period further erased speculations
that Ramos might try to stay beyond 1998. The constitution
provides for a single six-year term for the president.
</P>
<P>
Lim, a well-known effective crime-buster, followed Estrada and
de Venecia. He is running under the Liberal Party on a platform of
restoring peace and order in the country which has seen a surge in
crimes like kidnapping and drug trafficking in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Lim, who declared his presidential bid only last December, has
performed well in recent approval surveys. He enjoys the strong
support of former President Corazon Aquino and, reportedly,
influential Manila Archbishop Haime Sin.
</P>
<P>
Besides the three, other potential major candidates include
former Defense Secretary Renato de Villa of the Democratic Reform
Party, Senator Raul Rocco of the Democratic Action Party and
Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago of the People's Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
Political observers, however, predicted that some candidates
may lose steam during the 90-day campaign period due to lack of
fund and poor campaign management. The prolonged financial crisis
is expected to hamper fund raising by some candidates, they said.
</P>
<P>
The pressing task for the candidates now is to present their
platforms, especially their economic policies, to the electorate
which has already felt the bite of the financial crisis, observers
said.
</P>
<P>
A nationwide survey conducted recently by an independent
pollster showed that economy is the top issue for the forthcoming
general elections during which voters will also elect part of the
bicameral congress and new local governments.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the already seven-month-long currency crisis,
the country is facing an economic slowdown, increasing
unemployment and rising inflation. The next president will have
to face the challenge of revitalizing the crisis-battered economy.
</P>
<P>
And only the presidential candidate with the best funded and
managed campaign and best-received platform will emerge triumphant
in the showdown on May 11, observers said.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Issues Eurobonds for 543 Million Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian Central Bank
announced Monday that it will issue Eurobonds on Brazil for some
543 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian Eurobonds will be refundable on March 3, 2003.
This is the first bond issuance by Brazil in the international
market since October when the Asian financial crisis hit the world
stock exchanges in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian Central Bank announced Monday that the annual
interest rate of these Eurobonds is 8.625 percent, 3.90 percent
higher than similar bonds issued by France, and 4.17 percent
higher than similar bonds issued by the U.S., and also 0.05
percent higher than bonds issued by Argentina a week ago in the
European market under the same conditions.
</P>
<P>
"Paribas" and "SBC Warburg Dillon Read" will undertake the
sale of these bonds as part of a program directed by the National
Treasury of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
These two foreign banks were appointed on January 30 by Brazil
as joint lead managers and joint bookkeepers of the first issuance
of Brazilian Eurobonds.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, Brazil issued bonds for 19.1 billion
U.S. dollars in the international market in 1996 and about 20
billion U.S. dollars last year. It is expected that the amount
will exceed 20 billion U.S. dollars this year.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Announce New Exchange Rate System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
soon announce a new foreign exchange rate system to stabilize
prices of priority imports and help restore order to the country's
economy, a Bank Indonesia official said.
</P>
<P>
Miranda Gultom, a director of Bank Indonesia, the central bank,
said here Monday that the government is currently examining the
possibility of adopting the Currency Board System (CBS) which
would directly peg the rupiah (national currency) to the U.S.
dollar, the local press reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Gultom said several other countries and regions, including Hong
Kong and Argentina, have already adopted the system. The
Indonesian government is now studying the CBS as well as other
systems.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing in a system is that it should take
account of the conditions of the existing currency market, the
efficiency and productivity of the real sector," she added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bank Indonesia Governor Soedradjat Djiwandono
confirmed that the bank is now studying the CBS as a possible
replacement for the existing free float foreign exchange system.
But no decision has yet been made to actually apply it.
</P>
<P>
President Soeharto also confirmed the plan of Bank Indonesia on
Tuesday, saying, "We have to determine a stable exchange rate to
enable import-dependent manufacturing companies to facilitate
stable imports of basic necessities."
</P>
<P>
Soeharto said Indonesia has an adequate level of foreign
exchange reserves to support imports of raw materials which are
components for export-oriented companies.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah closed at 9,600/9,800 to the U.S. dollar Monday,
slightly lower than last week's close of 9,400/9,600.
</P>
<P>
In early July last year when monetary crisis started in
Southeast Asia, the rupiah traded at 2,400 per dollar.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said recently that Indonesia's foreign
exchange reserves stood at 19.06 billion dollars as of the end of
last month, enough to cover 4.7 months of imports.
</P>
<P>
The president said the government had used some of its foreign
reserves to intervene in the currency market to prop up the rupiah
against the dollar, but such interventions were not effective
since the dollars injected into the market were immediately
absorbed by speculators.
</P>
<P>
"Now we will take other steps that can kill them
(speculators)," Soeharto asserted.

<HEADLINE> US Urged to Stop Accusation Against Taiwan-Born Scientist (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Seven academicians of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences today called on the American
scientists to uphold justice and help Dr. Peter H. Lee, a
Taiwan-born Chinese American, be free from persecution in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
In an open letter released here today, the Chinese
academicians said that more than one month ago, the foreign media
reported that Dr. Peter H. Lee who worked first at Los Alamos
National Laboratory in the State of New Mexico and then at TRW in
the State of California, has been accursed of a crime by FBI and
arrested by the US Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
The accusation against him was allegedly that during his visit
to China in 1985, he provided this country with "some detailed
data related to use of lasers to simulate nuclear detonations, and
then in 1997 he gave the Chinese scientists "a lecture related to
his research work at TRW", they said.
</P>
<P>
The seven academicians who signed the letter are Chinese
physicists Gan-chang Wang, Da-heng Wang, Xi-de Xie, Jia-er Chen,
Nai-yan Wang, Zhi-zhan Xu and Xian-tu He.
</P>
<P>
So far, Dr. Lee has been forced to confess his so-called being
guilty and could face a maximum federal prison sentence of 15
years and a 250,000 US dollar fine if he's sentenced on February
23, 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the letter, some of the seven Chinese physicists
invited and hosted Dr. Lee for the academic exchange schedules and
conferences, some knew him as an eminent scientist and attended
his lectures, and some are academic leaders and research experts.
</P>
<P>
The physicists said that they are greatly shocked, for they are
clear that in 1985 and 1997, Dr. Lee successively delivered
lectures relating purely to basic research and never dealt with
so-called "data that might function as important military
applications to China."

The letter said that in January 1985, Dr. Lee gave lectures on
laser fusion which did not go beyond the contents that had been
published in the academic journals, such as "Laser focus" etc., by
American scientists around 1981, which was far from interpretable
as relevant to any secrecy "to simulate nuclear detonations."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, as a matter of fact as early as
in 1964, an idea on laser fusion had been proposed by the
scientists in China.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the laser fusion research has been conducted in
China accordingly and international exchanges took place as well,
adding "through this means we were acquaint with Dr. Lee," the
letter said.
</P>
<P>
In May of 1997, in his lectures, Dr. Lee talked about the
microwave backscattering from sea surface. He offered his papers,
which had already been published in the journals such as IEE
Proc.- Radar, Sonar Navig. and Applied Optics, they said.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing in the lectures during his visit went beyond the
findings in these academic papers," the letter stated.
</P>
<P>
The seven Chinese scientists said they could not help asking
why such ordinary academic exchanges have been imaginarily charged
with providing so-called "detailed data to China relating to use
of lasers to simulate nuclear detonations".
</P>
<P>
They said that the Sino-US relationship has gained a better
impetus due to Chinese President Jiang Zemin's successful visit to
the United States last year and US President Clinton's forthcoming
visit to China.
</P>
<P>
"At this moment, we do not like to see some people still
trying to jeopardize the friendly relationship between our two
nations in the academic circles."
</P>
<P>
They said that they are deeply concerned about the occurrence
of this event and sincerely appeal to the American People,
particularly American scientists, to free Dr. Lee from the
innocent persecution, which would benefit the healthy development
of the Sino-US relationship.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)
capped a fruitful year of co-operation with China in 1997 by
launching four new aid projects, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
IFAD signed an agreement last September to provide a loan of
26.5 million US dollars to help finance an integrated agricultural
development project in east China's Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
In another agreement, the WFP would provide food commodities
valued at 12.7 million US dollars to assist a poverty alleviation
program in Haidong Prefecture of northwest China's Qinghai
Province.
</P>
<P>
The other two items, concerning agricultural development and
the supply of tonics for women and children, have also received
approval from WFP. The total assistance is expected to be valued
at 4.74 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
With a total of 1.183 billion US dollars, the two international
institutions have aided 72 poverty-alleviation and food projects
in China, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
For example, the WFP 2708 Project in Qinghai Province, covering
six mountainous counties with a population of 260,000, included
the digging of 492 kilometers of irrigation ditches. Throughout
the course of the four-year project, 2.63 million trees were
planted. Tree planting helps to conserve water and prevent soil
erosion.
</P>
<P>
After the completion of WFP 3355 project in land-locked Gansu
Province, the forestry coverage increased from six percent to 11
percent and the annual precipitation increased 3.8 millimeters in
the project area, the newspaper reported.

<HEADLINE> Skiers Complain about Combined Slalom Course Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Very icy conditions of the
men's combined slalom course drew some complaints from skiers no
sooner than the first run of event completed Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
"It was really hard, very icy. It is impossible to get an edge in
ice that hard," said Ed Podivinsky of Canada, one of the contenders
for the event at Hakuba and 13th place after the first run.
</P>
<P>
"The event is favoriting the slalom skiers heavily over the
downhill. The downhill is easy here, and the slalom today was really
difficult. It is really unfair that the slalom skiers have such an
advantage," the Canadian added.
</P>
<P>
Lasse Kjus of Norway, who recorded the second fastest time of 48.09
seconds in the first run of the combined slalom, said: " The course
was much too icy. I was really sliding around."
</P>
<P>
Austria's favortie Hemann Maier was also unhappy, saying that "the
course was scandalous and setting had far too many turns and was too
tricky. The course was already broken and bad by the time that I went
down."
</P>
<P>
Maier sliped on the bottom third of the course and almost went out
of the race. He recovered to finish but with a time three seconds
more than leading Mario Reiter of Austria.
</P>
<P>
In combined esciplines making up the combined
should be the same level of difficulty in order to ensure fair
conditions for skiers who primarily do slalom, or those who primarily
do downhill.
</P>
<P>
In the top ten Tuesday, most of the skiers were slalom specialists.
</P>
<P>
Both competitions of the downhill and combined slalom, orginally
scheduled on last Sunday and Monday but were forced to postpone
because of heavy snow and fog. The combined slalom was rescheduled to
be held Tuesday but the downhill has not been recheduled yet.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien said Monday that his country supports the use of military
force against Iraq if diplomacy fails.
</P>
<P>
In an emergency debate in the House of Commons on Iraq,
Chretien said that he believed that Canada should support military
action if Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein does not comply.
</P>
<P>
However, the prime minister also stressed that military force
"is always the last resort."
</P>
<P>
If there is a military action, Canada will lend military
support, "not combat troops, but it will mean a Canadian presence
in the action against Saddam Hussein," Chretien noted.
</P>
<P>
But opposition leaders didn't seem ready to join Chretien in
supporting the U.S. military action.
</P>
<P>
Preston Manning, leader of the Official Opposition, listed six
conditions he said were necessary for military involvement by
Canada, and four of them have not been met.
</P>
<P>
Bloc Quebecois leader Gilles Ducceppe maintained that any
military intervention must be led by the United Nations, not
simply the United States.
</P>
<P>
Alexa McDonough, leader of the New Democratic Party, said that
Canada should "be on the side of those who seek to resolve this
crisis through negotiation and common sense."

YANGON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has introduced
ecotourism in an effort to promote tourism without harming the
nature by opening a mountain resort in the Kyaukpadaung area,
Mandalay Division.
</P>
<P>
The 232-square-kilometer Popa Mountain Resort, which was

The resort with eight rest houses, undertaken by the Woodland
Travels Co. Ltd., is the only green place in the arid region, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, to promote its tourism industry, Myanmar has opened
some islands including the Thahtay Island in Kawthaung to foreign
investors to build resorts. A resort hotel, the first of its kind,

<HEADLINE> Clinton Lawyer Files Leak Complaint in Federal Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton's private lawyer Monday filed a complaint with the U.S.
District Court asking for action in stopping alleged leaks from
independent counsel Kenneth Starr in the Monica Lewinsky
investigation.
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman says the complaint is under seal.
</P>
<P>
Attorney David Kendall said Friday he would file the
complaint. He alleged that illegal leaks from Starr's office are
corrupting the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Starr is using a federal grand jury here to probe whether
Clinton urged a former White House intern, 24-year-old Monica
Lewinsky, to lie under oath about an alleged affair with the
president.
</P>
<P>
Disclosure of grand jury information by an officer of the court
violates the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and is punishable
by a contempt of court citation.
</P>
<P>
Starr has vigorously denied that his office is the source of
the leaks, saying he had found no reason to believe that the leaks
have come from his office, but he said he would conduct his own
investigation.

<HEADLINE> Asian Crises Have Little Impact on Austrian Economy: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The economic and financial
crises in some Asian countries had little impact on the economy of
Austria, said a report released by the Institute for Economic
Research in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
Experts with the institute said in the monthly report on
economy for February that the Austrian economy has maintained the
momentum for growth since the beginning of 1998. Enterprisers
even estimated that most of the economic indices were better than
those in last October.
</P>
<P>
They said that except the construction sector, most industries
are recovering, and, in particular, the indices for the basic raw
material industry and the chemical industry "are more positive."
Even the sector of consumer's goods, which has been under the
pressure of low demands, showed signs of growing.
</P>
<P>
Given that only a quite small part of the Austrian exports goes
to Asia, the crises there had little impart on the export of
Austria. But they might have some impact on tourism in this
European country.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Bank Threatens to Control Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Tired of resorting to moral
suasion, the Central Bank of the Philippines has threatened to
assert its legal authority and re-impose controls on banks'
interest rates, the local press reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson was quoted as saying he
wants commercial banks to bring down their lending rates and if
they do not do this, he will probably do it by regulation.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's threat is seen as its latest
"carrot-and-stick" approach to force banks to lower the rates they
charge on loans.
</P>
<P>
During the past few months, the banks have failed to cut their
rates despite the central bank's repeated calls. As a result of
the currency crisis, the prime lending rates soared to 30 percent,
dealing a heavy blow to the country's business community and
manufacturing industry.
</P>
<P>
Singson cited presidential decrees which give the central bank
the legal mandate to change or remove the ceilings on interest
rates, but he was quick to add that such a move is not tantamount
to placing a cap on lending rates.
</P>
<P>
To address the interest rates problem, the Bankers Association
of the Philippines (BAP) has submitted a letter to Singson,
promising to cut the rates step by step to 22-23 percent by March
9.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on Singson's threat, BAP President Deogracias
Vistan said the BAP is prepared to deal with any move of the
central bank, but he added that re-imposing controls is not the
right solution.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Praises Air Crash Rescuers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos praised rescuers working in the massive search and rescue
operations of the country's worst air disaster in which 104 people
were feared killed.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers Tuesday quoted Ramos as saying he urged all
those involved in the task of recovery, identification and
disposition "to carry on with infinite patience and determination"
until the end of the humanitarian mission.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also lauded the management and personnel of the Cebu
Pacific Airlines to which the ill-fated CD-9 jet plane belongs,
adding that "the manner by which the concerns of the relatives of
the victims have been attended to is commendable."
</P>
<P>
The president also ordered investigators to look into the crash
to "pinpoint responsibility" so the government can take "proper
punitive, corrective and preventive actions."
</P>
<P>
So far rescuers had brought down 73 bags containing body parts
and personal belongings of the victims by helicopters from the
crash site at the mountain area of Claveria Town in Misamis
Oriental.
</P>
<P>
Jesus Dureza, general supervisor of the rescue operations, said
19 more body bags are expected to be brought down. He added that
the five crew members and 99 passengers aboard the plane were
believed all dead.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the United States, Britain and the Philippines
have reportedly identified some 30 of the crash victims using
forensic and DNA technique, but they only revealed the names of
five. They said the process of identifying the decaying mangled
body parts could take up to six months.
</P>
<P>
During the past two days, the rescuers recovered both the
cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder, also called
black box of the plane.
</P>
<P>
The black box, which contains important information including
air speed, flying direction, engine power and rate of descent
before the crash, would be sent to Canada for its manufacturers
there to check the cause of the air disaster.
</P>
<P>
The jet plane was bound for Cagayan de Oro city on the southern
island of Mindanao from Metro Manila when it slammed onto a
mountain in Misamis Oriental Province on February 2.

WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- An American Airlines plane
was heavily damaged in landing as it missed a runway at the
International Airport in Chicago Monday, but no one of the 121

</P>
<P>
The Boeing 727 landed 200 meters short of the runway and

<HEADLINE> International Phone Calls Not So Common In Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Nearly three out of ten
Shanghai residents have never made an overseas telephone call, a
recent survey that appeared in Sunday's Xinmin Evening News found.
</P>
<P>
Of those polled, 29 percent had never made a phone call
overseas, and of the people who often make overseas calls fewer
than 30 percent make more than three calls each day.
</P>
<P>
The high cost of phone calls is the primary reason for the low
numbers. People also worry about possible disputes over telephone
charges, which usually take a long time to settle.
</P>
<P>
The increasing use of e-mail, which can send a large amount of
information at a low cost, is putting a further squeeze on long
distance calls.

<HEADLINE> Garbage Handling to Be Free of Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The pollution-free handling of
garbage is gaining momentum in the Chinese capital, with new
campaigns being launched and new facilities being built, today's
"China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
citizens in Beijing's four central districts will bid farewell
to dustbins by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Instead, they will have to take their bags of garbage to
collecting carts. Then the carts will take the refuse to 715
garbage collection centers scattered in the city.
</P>
<P>
Now throughout the capital, removing dustbins is the first step
in Beijing's campaign to improve garbage handling.
</P>
<P>
By last year, about 35 percent of Beijing's daily 12,000-tons
of garbage was treated pollution-free, according to the
statistics from Beijing Environmental Sanitation Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, with a 40-million-mark grant from Germany and 200
million yuan (24 million US dollars) from the local government,
work had been completed on two sanitary landfill sites, two
garbage transfer stations and one special treatment center where
garbage can be fermented and turned into organic fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
The second stage of construction is expected to wind up in
Beishenshu and An'ding sanitary landfill sites by the end of the
year. With financial support by a grant from Spain, the city will
also set up a new sanitary landfill site in Liulitun in Northest
Beijing's Haidian District.
</P>
<P>
With new facilities, it is expected that about 60 percent of
the capital's daily garbage will be treated pollution-free.

<HEADLINE> US Republicans Say Air Strikes on Iraq Not Enough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republican lawmakers
said on Monday that air strikes on Iraq alone was not enough to
change the political pattern of Iraq and urged the Clinton
administration to consider more options for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
"There are a number of things that can be done between just
pure diplomacy and military action," Senate Majority leader
Trent Lott said. His remarks represented increasing voices of
the Republicans in Congress.
</P>
<P>
Lott listed some other options like imposing a no-fly zone
across all Iraq, supporting opposition movements in Iraq and
launching a "Radio Free Iraq" propaganda program.
</P>
<P>
"We should be supportive of democratic factions wherever we
can find them in Iraq. We could consider expanding the no-fly
zone and no-drive zone regions... I would like for us to try to
find ways to limit his ability to spew his venom to his people
and have a 'Radio Free Iraq,'" he said.
</P>
<P>
A senior administration official said the ideas being posed
by Lott and others were on a menu being considered by the
administration, but, for the moment, only as possibilities after
air strikes.
</P>
<P>
Republican senator John McCain advocated strikes designed to
inflict serious damage on Iraq's elite Revolutionary Guard forces
as well as strikes aimed at severing Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein's links with his people.
</P>
<P>
McCain also advocated expanded propaganda broadcasts into
Iraq, expansion of the no-fly and no-drive zones, and logistical
support of Iraqi opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
"The time for talks may be over," McCain said. "Diplomacy has
failed thus far ... The only viable military option is to
inflict serious damage ... And we should be prepared to act
alone if necessary."
</P>
<P>
Republican Senator Chuck Hagel believed that military option
alone will not work, which he said must be combined with political
action.
</P>
<P>
Lott said the Senate might take up the Iraq resolution later
this week. The resolution has been postponed for voting for a
second week because of differences over the goal of the possible
air strike.

<HEADLINE> Albright Says New NATO Members Support U.S. on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said on Monday that Poland, Hungary and the
Czech Republic -- three invitees to join the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) -- support the U.S. in taking action against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
During a speech on NATO enlargement at a Washington think tank,
Albright said, "They all said they are ready to support us as
appropriate should military become necessary."
</P>
<P>
Albright said foreign Ministers Jaroslav Sedivy of the Czech
Republic, Laszlo Kovacs of Hungary and Bronislaw Geremek of Poland
informed her of their nations' positions on the Iraq crisis during
a meeting at the State Department.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton plans to ask the Senate Wednesday
to ratify a decision by all the 16 alliance members to admit the
three former Warsaw Pact nations.
</P>
<P>
The support expressed by the three foreign ministers for the
U.S. is apparently a bid to gain a quick approval of the plan by
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
The United States has amassed some 300 combat aircraft and
nearly 20,000 troops in the Middle East, gearing up for a
large-scale air campaign should Iraq continue to block U.N.
inspections of sites allegedly used to produce chemical and
biological weapons. However, it has gained few support from its
allies.

ATHENS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government Monday
established a team of ministers in order to tackle its problem
with protesting farmers who have blockaded the country's northern
highways for a week.
</P>
<P>
The five-member team, headed by Greece's Agricultural Minister
Stephanos Tzoumakas, invited the representatives of farmers to
have talks with them in the Agricultural Ministry building
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Farmers have been blocking Greece's national highways in the
prefectures of Thessaloniki, Pieria and Imathia, causing serious
disruption to traffic.
</P>
<P>
They have warned that they would continue blockades until their
demands are met for state subsidies and cheaper petrol for
agricultural use.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Stresses Cooperation With Ukraine on Nuclear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States will
likely allow its firms to construct civilian reactors in Ukraine
if Kiev does not provide nuclear reactor turbines to Iran, the
State Department said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We want to be able to increase our economic cooperation with
Ukraine," said State Department spokesman James Foley. "Peaceful
nuclear cooperation is possible. And we have made clear our strong
desire Ukraine not provide" the turbines to Iran, he added.
</P>
<P>
Washington has been pressing Ukraine, the third largest
recipient of American aid at 300 million U.S. dollars annually,
not to sell the turbines to Russia, who intends to install the
turbines at an Iranian nuclear power facility.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration is willing to sign an accord with
Kiev on so-called peaceful nuclear cooperation _ a congressional
requirement for allowing American firms to construct civilian
atomic reactors abroad.
</P>
<P>
The agreement would reduce Kiev's dependency on Moscow for
nuclear equipment as well as fuel, and it would allow firms like
Westinghouse Electric Corp. to bid on a planned 1.2 billion U.S.
dollars project to complete two Russian-designed atomic power
plants.

<HEADLINE> Albright Stresses US-European Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said Monday that the trans-Atlantic partnership
is the "strategic base" to meet the challenges in the world.
</P>
<P>
"However old or new the challenges we face, there is still one
relationship that more than any other will determine whether we
meet them successfully, and that is our relationship with Europe,"
Albright said while addressing the New Atlantic Initiative, a
think tank based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
"The trans-Atlantic partnership is our strategic base, the
drive wheel of progress on every world-scale issue when we agree,
and the brake when we do not," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), Albright said that Poland, Hungary and the
Czech Republic will be "part of a trans-Atlantic partnership that
is not only broader, but also deeper."
</P>
<P>
NATO leaders decided in July to accept Poland, Hungary and the
Czech Republic by 1999. The decision needs to be ratified by the
U.S. Senate and Clinton plans to send it there Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Canada and Denmark became the first NATO
members among the 16 to ratify the decision.
</P>
<P>
"If the Senate says yes to a larger NATO..., that will be a
vote for a continued American engagement in Europe," Albright
said.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a signal that America will defend its values,
protect its interests, stand by its allies, and keep its word,"
she added.

<HEADLINE> New Drug to Offer Relief for Asthma Sufferers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The first drug in two decades to
offer a new way of controlling asthma symptoms was launched Monday
in Britain, local newspapers reported.
</P>
<P>
The tablet, montelukast, which is to be sold under the brand
name Singulair, is intended as an add-on treatment with existing
drugs to reduce day and night-time attacks.
</P>
<P>
For more than 20 years, the standard treatment for asthma, the
only treatable chronic condition in the Western world which is on
the increase, has been inhaled steroids.
</P>
<P>
Trials of montelukast have shown that when used with inhaled
steroids together, it cuts asthma attacks by half as compared to
those who used only inhalers.
</P>
<P>
Three-and-a-half million people in the UK are estimated to
suffer from asthma, including 1.5 million children aged two to 15.
</P>
<P>
The epidemic is caused by chemicals in the body which cause
airways to tighten when asthmatics come in contact with certain
allergens.
</P>
<P>
The new drug is targeted at chemicals in the lungs that produce
asthmatic symptoms. By reducing the inflammation of the lungs and
opening up the tubes in the organ, it can allow the patient to
breathe more easily.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Reviewing Compromise Campaign Finance Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- Democrats in the U.S. Senate
are reviewing a compromise proposal to impose new curbs on the
political use of union dues and corporate funds to advance
campaign finance legislation expected to return to the Senate
floor by early March.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, put forward by Senator Olympia Snowe, a
Republican, is an alternative to broader restraints on union
political activity being sought by Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott and other Republican lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
Snowe said in an interview Monday she hopes that "we can create
middle ground on this whole issue."
</P>
<P>
She said she was "trying to bridge the gap" between supporters
of campaign finance legislation and the concerns on the Republican
side about "leveling the playing field in term of the role unions
play."
</P>
<P>
Campaign finance legislation, which fell victim to dueling
filibusters last fall, is scheduled to return to the Senate floor
either later this month or early in March.
</P>
<P>
The legislation is expected to face obstacles in both the
Senate and House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
The main element of the bipartisan Senate legislation, crafted
by Senators John McCain, a Republican, and Feingold, would ban
so-called "soft money" contributions to the national political
parties from corporations, labor unions and wealthy individuals.
</P>
<P>
It also provides for stricter disclosure of political donations
and includes a provision designed to strengthen the current
prohibition on donations from foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Lott and other Senate Republicans are seeking to attach a
provision requiring unions to obtain written permission from
individual members before using their dues for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
They said that organized labor spent millions in compulsory
union dues on political activity in 1995 and 1996, much of it
aimed at defeating Republican candidates and electing Democrats.
</P>
<P>
When Lott first proposed restrictions on union dues last fall,
Democrats countered that similar curbs should apply to
organizations such as the Christian Coalition, which typically
spend heavily to elect Republicans.

<HEADLINE> Annan Recommends Setting Up of UN Office in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today expressed his intention to reestablish a United
Nations liaison office in Sierra Leone and recommended that the
Security Council consider sending as many as 10 military staff to
the country.
</P>
<P>
In his latest report to the Security Council, the
secretary-general stopped short of recommending the establishment
of a United Nations peacekeeping operation in Sierra Leone, saying
that such a force would be premature.
</P>
<P>
Instead, he called for placing the immediate focus on
implementing a peace agreement which would restore the legitimate
government to power.
</P>
<P>
The government of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah was overthrown
by a military junta on May 25, 1997. Although the junta remains in
power, the two parties did sign a peace agreement on October 23,
1997. Under the agreement, the junta agreed to the restoration of
President Kabbah to power on April of this year.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief stressed in his report that his special envoy to
Sierra Leone, Francis G. Okelo, was prepared to assist in efforts
to implement the agreement.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the United Nations liaison office in
Sierra Leone will initially have a small staff, including a
political officer, a military officer and a humanitarian officer.
Eventually, the office could be expanded to comprise human rights
and information officers.
</P>
<P>
The proposed military liaison cell, if established, would
assess and report on the situation in Sierra Leone and coordinate
regional and international efforts in the country.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general said such a cell would signal the
commitment of the international community to the implementation of
the agreement and would serve as an important confidence building
measure.
</P>
<P>
The report printed a dire picture of the humanitarian situation
in Sierra leone, noting no food has come in the country since last
May's coup. In the absence of new supplies of food aid, commercial
food is increasingly scarce and expensive.
</P>
<P>
The security situation is highly volatile in the countryside,
according to the report. While the junta has control in Freetown,
intensified guerrilla-style actions are being conducted by an
organization called the Civil Defense Unit which is comprised of
traditional hunters.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general expressed particular concern about the
extremely tense situation in the southern town of Bo. He said
civilians have reportedly been attacked and killed in the road to
Bo.
</P>
<P>
A United Nations team is in Sierra Leone assessing the
humanitarian situation and the impact of sanctions on the
civilians population. The UN chief said the team should facilitate
the early start of cross-border humanitarian relief efforts in
order to alleviate the suffering of innocent civilians.

<HEADLINE> More UK Firms in Favor of Britain Joining EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 9 (Xinhua) -- British companies that favor
Britain joining the European economic and monetary union (EMU) now
amount to 48 percent, compared with only 30 percent last year, the
Financial Times reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a significant minority, 34 percent of those
companies, now still retains their objections to Britain being
inside the euro zone. Last year, 41 percent were against such a
move.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that many firms are coming to the conclusion
that the risks of being out are greater than they thought a year
ago now that participation in EMU is likely to be broader.
</P>
<P>
Citing a report by the Bank of England, the newspaper also said
that small companies in Britain have made only limited
preparations for EMU during last year because those companies are
unsure of what is required.
</P>
<P>
The bank warned that even small companies trading only
domestically will feel the knock-on effect of the euro through the
supply chain from January 1999.

<HEADLINE> UN Warns Potential Tragedy in S.Sudan With Gov't </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 9 (Xinhua) -- The Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs announced today that as of
February 4, the government of the Sudan denies humanitarian
agencies access to recently displaced populations by suspending
all flights into the Bahr el Ghazal Region of the southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 100,000 displaced -- mainly women and children --
were reported to be fleeing the civil conflict that flared up in
and around the towns of Wau, Aweil and Gogrial over the past week.
</P>
<P>
The displaced people were said to be gathering in a number of
locations in Bahr el Ghazal, but were reported to be week, hungry
and in urgent need of assistance in the form of food, medicines
and shelter materials.
</P>
<P>
The office said these flight suspensions are putting the lives
of vulnerable civilians at great risk. The people displaced have
been walking for several days without food and with little water
and are exhausted.
</P>
<P>
The flights ban covers almost half of the population of the
southern Sudan and has a serious impact, not only on the
war-affected population, but also on hundreds of thousands of
women and children living in Bahr el Ghazal, one of the most
deprived areas in the South, which was already experiencing a
severe food deficit before the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
The office said that with little or no medicines on the ground,
wounded civilians caught in the conflict have no chance of
receiving medical care. Cases of diarrhoeal diseases are already
reported among children in the move.
