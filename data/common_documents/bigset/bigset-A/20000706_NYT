TAKING ON LAZIO OVER ABORTION
</HEADLINE>
  By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York affiliate of the National Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League said Wednesday that it would
broadcast a 30-second advertisement that is intended to cast doubts
about the abortion record of Rep. Rick Lazio, the Republican
candidate for Senate. The group, which has endorsed Lazio's
Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, said it would spend
$50,000, a relatively modest amount, buying time on cable stations
with sizable audiences of women.
</P>
<P>
   TITLE _ ``One Question.''
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER _ Sheinkopf Ltd., which is usually allied with
Democratic candidates and committees.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN _ The commercial opens with a shot of Ross
DeMarco, a member of the abortion rights group. She is sitting with
her hands clasped, speaking to the camera. It cuts to text _ ``How
Would Lazio Vote on Judges?'' _ before showing footage of the
Supreme Court confirmation hearings of Robert Bork, a conservative
judge who was rejected by the Senate. It then superimposes a
headline from The New York Post referring to Lazio as being a
``master of ambiguity'' on abortion and cuts to more text _ ``Would
Lazio Oppose Anti-Choice Judges?'' It ends with a telephone number
for the abortion rights group.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT _ ``I have one question for Rick Lazio,'' DeMarco
says. ``How would he vote in the United States Senate when it comes
to the Supreme Court and abortion? Like most New Yorkers, I believe
it's a woman's right to decide. One Supreme Court decision could
rob us of this choice. Now Rick Lazio is saying he can't promise
New Yorkers he'd oppose anti-choice judges. So how would Rick Lazio
vote on Supreme Court nominations? It's a simple question. New
Yorkers deserve an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY _ Lazio generally supports abortion rights, but he
opposes the use of government money to pay for abortions, and he
has also voted to ban the procedure that abortion critics refer to
as ``partial birth'' abortion. As the advertisement states, Lazio
has declined to pledge to vote against Supreme Court nominees
opposed to abortion rights. In recent days, though, he has
emphasized that he would consider abortion views in deciding
whether to confirm them. ``I just don't think there ought to be any
litmus test,'' he said on the campaign trail Wednesday. Clinton has
said she would not vote for a nominee opposed to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD _ The advertisement is clearly directed at suburban
women, a constituency that strongly favors abortion rights, and one
that Clinton has had a difficult time wooing. The Clinton campaign
and its allies have repeatedly sought to depict Lazio as too
conservative for New York. But because Lazio generally supports
abortion rights, the abortion rights group is forced to make a more
nuanced attack to draw a distinction between the two candidates,
focusing on his position on judicial nominees, rather than on
abortion itself. The commercial thus seeks to link Lazio to the
possibility of a more conservative Supreme Court that would be
hostile to abortion. The question is whether this strategy will
galvanize suburban women, given that they have lived for so long
under the landmark 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has also tried to turn the abortion issue against Clinton
by asserting that her opposition to banning ``partial birth''
abortion is extreme and does not jibe with the views of most New
Yorkers and even some prominent Democrats, including Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, who is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is the difference between NARAL and myself is that I
support the ban on partial-birth abortion,'' Lazio said Wednesday.
``They are strongly opposed to the ban. And that defines the
difference between Hillary Clinton, NARAL and me. I think my
position is a mainstream position.''

TURNAROUND OF PARADE SHIPS IS DEFENDED 
</HEADLINE>
  By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An official of the Fourth of July Parade of Sails on
Wednesday defended decisions by two captains to turn 27 tall ships
around before reaching Upper Manhattan, a move that disappointed
thousands of eager spectators.
</P>
<P>
   The defense came as Mayor Rudolph Giuliani suggested that the
organizers of Operation Sail may have barely managed to execute the
whole event.
</P>
<P>
   The captains of the Eagle, from the U.S. Coast Guard, and the
Cisne Branco, from Brazil, led separate turnarounds of two lines of
ships on the Hudson River, said Gregory Perrin, vice president of
Operation Sail, the nonprofit group that put on the event.
</P>
<P>
   Both captains turned around farther south than scheduled to make
sure their ships had time to dock safely, before the tides changed,
he said. The other tall ships followed their lead.
</P>
<P>
   But one OpSail executive, Paul Welling, a retired Coast Guard
vice admiral, said that while the dozen ships docking on the East
River had to turn around early to take advantage of ideal tidal
conditions, those docking on the Hudson should not have had to turn
around.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people in Upper Manhattan and northern New Jersey
were let down when the full parade did not go all the way up to the
George Washington Bridge as they had expected. Most of the
four-masted Class A ships measured more than 300 feet in length and
were the most impressive in the parade.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference at P.S. 48 in the Washington Heights
section of Manhattan, Giuliani declined to address the turnaround,
but said that there were tensions between the city and Operation
Sail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not have the greatest relationship with OpSail, so I am
not about to defend them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did note from the complaints that I got from the people who
worked with OpSail that this was not a terribly well-managed
operation. Now, they pulled it off, it worked. But there were times
in which it almost looked like it wasn't going to work at all.''
</P>
<P>
   But Perrin said that ``all the operations went off without a
hitch.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the turnaround, the captains could have been reacting to
a number of variables, including currents and wind conditions, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The captain of a vessel is ultimately responsible for the
safety of that vessel,'' Perrin said. ``Whatever variables came
into play, OpSail is not in a position to question the decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The captains wanted to get their ships to their berths during
slack water, an eight-minute window of time when the tide is not
coming in or going out, Perrin said. On the East River especially,
the water can be treacherous at other times, and tall ships cannot
be maneuvered easily into the narrow piers.
</P>
<P>
   Welling said that if the dozen ships docking on the East River
had missed slack water, they would have had to wait several hours
for the tide to shift and then use tug boats.

EDITORIAL: RENDEZVOUS AT CAMP DAVID  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, July 6:
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's convening of a summit meeting between
Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian leader,
Yasser Arafat, next week will usefully quicken the pace of Mideast
peace negotiations two months ahead of the deadline both sides have
set for a final agreement. As Clinton noted Wednesday, standing
still is not an option in the quest for Middle East peace. Like
Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel and President Anwar Sadat
of Egypt when they gathered at Camp David at President Carter's
invitation 22 years ago, Barak and Arafat must summon the courage
to make difficult compromises or risk losing a historic opportunity
to end the half-century-old conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has long sought such a meeting, believing it could help
hold together his fractious Cabinet and revive a negotiating
momentum that has been ebbing. Wednesday's resignation threat by
Interior Minister Natan Sharansky underscored Barak's problems.
Arafat also recognizes that only the two top leaders can make the
decisions necessary for peace. But he had argued that more
groundwork needed to be laid in lower-level talks before a useful
summit meeting could be held.
</P>
<P>
   Those lower-level talks have now reached their limit. Forward
movement has stalled, leaks about possible Israeli territorial
concessions have raised resistance and both sides have resorted to
strident rhetoric over a possible Palestinian declaration of
statehood. Under these circumstances, the White House was right to
move for an early meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The main issues to be resolved are competing claims to
Jerusalem, borders between Israeli and Palestinian territory, the
future of Jewish settlements and the rights of Palestinian
refugees. Settling them will require compromises that will leave
neither side happy but that both sides can live with.
</P>
<P>
   The Camp David meetings begin next Tuesday and could run
anywhere from a few days to a few weeks, with President Clinton
participating on a regular basis. Any peace agreement between
Israel and the Palestinians produced under his auspices would
enhance Clinton's place in history. But the importance of achieving
Mideast peace should transcend personality or partisanship. Gov.
George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee,
would be wise to give full support to Clinton's peacemaking
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Achieving a final agreement between Israel and the Palestinians
would crown decades of Mideast diplomacy and resolve the central
conflict between Israel and its Arab neighbors. Much of the
preliminary work is done, but the remaining issues are
excruciatingly difficult. The passage of time is unlikely to make
them easier to resolve.

NONPROFIT PAY REFLECTS MALE-FEMALE DISPARITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. - Average earnings for women are 73 cents on
the dollar compared with men, the National Committee on Pay Equity
said in April.
</P>
<P>
   That's an unfair use of total pay figures, countered the
Employment Policy Foundation in May: Compare earnings of full-time
workers 21 to 35 - especially single women - and there's no pay gap
at all.
</P>
<P>
   While advocacy groups played a statistical tug of war about
whether men earn more than women, the new ``2000 Salary and
Benefits Survey of Greater Kansas City Area Nonprofit
Organizations'' pulled together some interesting numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The data tend to endorse the Pay Equity group's contention.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, commissioned by the Center for Management
Assistance, collected compensation data from 251 area nonprofits of
all sizes and purposes. The center's executive director, Carol
Suter, was surprised at the findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``On average, there is very competitive pay for men working in
nonprofits compared to those working in the for-profit sector,''
Suter said. ``But that's not so for women.''
</P>
<P>
   The center, which provides management assistance to area
nonprofits, found that men made an average of 21 percent more than
women in directly comparable positions. Some examples of mean
salaries:
</P>
<P>
   Executive director: $70,164 for men, $50,138 for women.
</P>
<P>
   Associate director: $69,100 for men, $42,285 for women.
</P>
<P>
   Development director: $51,823 for men, $40,972 for women.
</P>
<P>
   Finance director: $49,091 for men, $36,366 for women.
</P>
<P>
   In only one nonprofit job category - human resource director -
did women's salaries equal or exceed men's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps,'' Suter theorized, ``women working in that capacity
know better than people in other kinds of positions what
competitive rates of pay are, so they know what to ask for when
they're hired.''
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Management Assistance is not a political group,
and it takes no formal position on gender equity. But its survey
results speak volumes.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit industry traditionally is dominated by women
employees. While the American work force is 44 percent women, the
Kansas City area nonprofit sector work force is 66 percent women.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-one percent of area nonprofits are headed by women; 67
percent of their upper management teams are women. Apparently, the
``sisterhood'' isn't powerful enough to elevate its members' pay to
the level of male counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   The disparity raises questions.
</P>
<P>
   Is employment in nonprofits consciously or unconsciously viewed
as an extension of the volunteer work that so many women do without
pay?
</P>
<P>
   Does it matter that it's a nonprofits survey? Would the pay
disparity look the same in the for-profit sector, but we just don't
know it because we don't see the numbers?
</P>
<P>
   And, if nonprofit pay is competitive with for-profit pay for
men, why does the industry appear willing to hang the old
``sackcloth and ashes'' expectation on women who choose careers in
nonprofits? Why are women not worth market value, too?
</P>
<P>
   The apparent inequities deserve scrutiny by nonprofit boards
that set compensation.

CLINTON TO TALK ABOUT HEALTH CARE AT UNIVERSITY OF
MISSOURI-COLUMBIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - President Clinton will give Missouri a warm
endorsement as a model for health-insurance reform Thursday and
indirectly, at least, turn up the political heat on Sen. John
Ashcroft a notch.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will tell a University of Missouri-Columbia audience
that Congress must pass a patients' bill of rights, which gives
consumers more choices in health care and gives them authority to
sue their insurance providers for bad service.
</P>
<P>
   The House last fall passed a bill Clinton backs, but the Senate
is a vote short of following suit. Supporters saw Ashcroft, a
Missouri Republican, as a key swing vote, although Ashcroft voted
for a different plan last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president wants to do everything possible to highlight the
importance of this issue and to swing a few votes,'' said Chris
Jennings, deputy assistant to the president for health policy.
``Missouri has taken a leadership role in the patients' bill of
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Tim Harlan, a Columbia Democrat who sponsored a 1997
Missouri law similar to the bill that passed in the U.S. House,
said, ``He clearly wants to get some grass-roots support for the
bill and we've had three years experience with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will share the speaking platform at Jesse Auditorium
with Harlan and Gov. Mel Carnahan, who is trying to unseat
Ashcroft. The president's appearance may prove to highlight the
difference between Ashcroft and Carnahan on the issue. Last week,
Carnahan's campaign blasted Ashcroft for not backing a ``real''
patients' bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the president's trip, the Missouri Republican
Party said it smacked of using public dollars for political gain.
It is a private event, with tickets distributed by Carnahan,
Clinton and the university, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously a quick political hit intended to benefit Mel
Carnahan and any other Democrat willing to participate in the
charade,'' state party Executive Director John Hancock said in a
press release late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political party that illegally used a Buddhist temple to
shake down campaign contributors in 1996 is using the University of
Missouri to shake down taxpayers this year,'' Hancock said,
referring to Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan spokesman Jerry Nachtigal said that Republicans ``were
looking for a parade to rain on,'' and that nothing is improper
about the president's speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding is this was a White House call on where this
would be held,'' Nachtigal said. ``They looked over sites and liked
the size of this one. This is not a campaign event for the
governor. He is here to talk about health care and that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Farinella, manager of Carnahan's campaign, said they had
nothing to do with Clinton's appearance. ``They announced it to
us,'' he said. ``I'm sure it's about trying to pass a strong
patients' bill of rights. It's important in our view, too, to get
that bill passed.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Hilton, spokesman for Ashcroft's Senate office, said that
``bipartisanship and constructive effort are indispensable'' to
enacting a patients' bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Partisan pep rallies, closed to the public, won't get the job
done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft is one of three senators whom the American Medical
Association announced last month it was focusing on as the 50th and
deciding vote to pass the House bill. The proposal failed by three
votes in the Senate on June 8.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Ashcroft voted instead for an amendment that critics
said doesn't give patients much leverage to sue their insurance
carriers. Ashcroft disagreed, saying it sets a $10,000 penalty for
carriers that fail to meet obligations and permits recovery of up
to $350,000 in damages in federal court only.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the House bill, however, want lawsuits handled in
state courts and want unlimited damages. Critics say that would
lead to excessive and expensive lawsuits, with costs passed on as
higher premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan signed the 1997 Missouri law that removed immunity that
health-maintenance organizations had from lawsuits. Harlan said
there has been only one apparent suit in Missouri since the law
passed.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri law also required HMOs to give patients more
options on getting tests and seeing specialists. It set up a
third-party review process to resolve disputes over health-care
decisions. In the past three years, about 300 appeals have been
filed and the outcome has been split about evenly in favor of
patient and insurers, Harlan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri law applies to people who are covered by
health-maintenance organizations, which Harlan said amounts to
about 40 percent of all insured state residents. The other 60
percent, not covered by the state law, are in self-insurance plans
in which employers pay medical bills directly.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate versions of proposed federal laws would cover people
in self-insurance plans but not those in traditional insurance
programs. The House bill would cover both, which the insurance
industry opposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the critical question,'' AMA chairman Ted Lewers said
late last week. ``Who do you want in charge of your health
insurance? Big insurance, which is more interested in profits than
in patients. Or your own physician, who you know will put patients
first?''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Cohen, at the Health Insurance Association of America,
responded that it is doctors who are concerned about making money.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is being sold in the guise of patient rights is really
about other issues, such as reimbursements to providers,'' Cohen
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the House bill would duplicate and complicate state
laws that already exist in Missouri and some other states: ``The
bill has a number of onerous, redundant and unnecessary
requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   While much of the concern centers on insurer restrictions on
patient and doctor options in making health-care decisions, Cohen
said overall service remains very high.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this perception that insurance companies deny care,
but 97 percent of claims submitted are paid right off the bat,''
Cohen said. ``It's hard to see how reality and myth line up here.''

EDITORIAL: EUROPE'S ROLE IN COLOMBIA  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, July 6:
</P>
<P>
   In Madrid Friday, officials from industrialized nations and
international organizations are meeting to discuss what, if
anything, the rest of the world should do for Colombia now that
Washington is giving it $1.3 billion _ much of it in the form of
helicopters. The group, which is largely European, will not spend
the money to match Washington's influence in Colombia. But a
well-financed European program with input from Colombian society
can help to minimize the chance that the military aid will weaken
the civilian government, increase violence against peasants and
harm the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Although Washington's package does contain $200 million to
strengthen Colombia's threadbare civilian government _ such as
aiding the judicial system _ these programs could be crushed by an
infusion of military aid at a time when the civilian leadership is
dangerously weak. Military aid strengthens armies, and officers may
become even more willing to defy the government.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. package contains conditions that require respect for
civilian rule. For example, officers must stop aiding the brutal
paramilitary groups moving into the coca regions. The president,
however, can waive these conditions on ``national security''
grounds. The Europeans should insist this waiver not be used, and
they should make their own financial contribution to improving the
justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's aid also depends heavily on fumigation of
coca-growing areas, possibly with a risky new biological agent,
according to a report in Thursday's Times by Tim Golden. Fumigation
has driven coca production farther into the jungle and turned
peasants into supporters of the guerrillas. European nations should
finance pilot crop substitution projects, which could be more
effective and lasting.
</P>
<P>
   Europe should also support the peace process, which may not
survive a widening of the war. European nations should use their
credibility with the guerrillas to emphasize the importance of
ending kidnappings and coca trafficking. They can also finance
development projects, which the Colombian government has endorsed
and which can make peace talks more acceptable to the guerrillas.
One of the biggest obstacles to peace is the guerrillas' fears that
they will be massacred if they become civilian politicians _ the
fate of thousands of former guerrillas in the mid-1980s. Europe
should support human rights programs and strengthen the
government's efforts to prosecute death squads.

CALIFORNIA MAY MISS OUT ON GAS PRICE BREAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 &HT;    By BRENT HOPKINS AND ERIK NELSON  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Gasoline prices in the Los Angeles area could soon
hit $2 a gallon, even as much of the rest of the nation enjoys
relief, analysts who follow the petroleum industry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   With prices now averaging $1.68 a gallon in Southern California,
any disruption - such as a refinery fire like one last year in
Torrance - would shoot prices to $2, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's any hiccup at all in the production pipeline, we're
going to see an effect on pricing,'' said Jeff Spring of the
Automobile Club of Southern California. ``There's very little
margin for error.''
</P>
<P>
   Burgeoning demand for gas by cash-flush California vacationers
and the rising price of crude oil have driven up pump prices,
despite recent increases in foreign oil production, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   And gas supplies that would otherwise go to California have been
siphoned to the Midwest, where federal regulatory action has
mandated the switch to cleaner-burning fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Some motorists seem resigned to paying the price, especially
those who drive for a living.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prices go up, but our wages don't, so it's putting a
strain on us. I have to continue, I have no choice,'' said Jonathan
Marquez, 39, who sometimes has to fill up his Ford Aerostar twice a
day while working as a messenger.
</P>
<P>
   The pump price increase has crept up on the Southland because
highly competitive gas station operators have taken only bare-bones
profits, or none at all, said Tom Kloza, publisher of the New
Jersey-based Oil Price Information Service, a trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very quietly the West Coast wholesale price has advanced 15 to
20 cents since June 15,'' ``The wholesale cost at terminals is
about $1.25 (a gallon) in California right now. When you add on
taxes and freight and whatever, it's close to $1.70.''
</P>
<P>
   But station operators no longer will forgo profits, predicted
Tim Hamilton, franchise issues director for AutoCal, a nonprofit
trade association for Southland gas stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public has got about 6 more cents right now that they
haven't seen yet. These dealers have eaten it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tajinder Chahal, general manager of the Woodland
Hills Carwash, a Union 76 affiliate, the profit on gas is minor.
``What we make on gas is really low,'' Chahal said. ``It's only a
couple cents a gallon.''
</P>
<P>
   That number is borne out - to the penny - in the most recent
weekly survey by the state Energy Commission, which found that
dealers were making 2 cents on a gallon of gasoline, while
refineries were making 36 cents. The rest goes to taxes and other
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are out-of-business numbers. Unless you're Amazon.com,
you can't run a business that loses money. They're going to be
forced by economics to raise prices,'' Kloza said.
</P>
<P>
   Refineries producing California's unique summer blend of
cleaner-burning gasoline - formulated to meet state and federal
air-pollution regulations - are operating at full tilt and reaping
profits, Kloza said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every refiner is doing very, very well and every oil producer
is doing very, very well,'' Kloza said.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline producers defended the increases, saying they are
responding to rises in the price of crude oil and the demand for
cleaner gas. ``There's just not that much supply available,'' said
Cheryl Burnett, a spokeswoman for London-based BP Amoco.
</P>
<P>
   However, Barnett conceded that gas prices are higher in areas
where there are relatively fewer stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oftentimes the prices between areas of the state are related
to competition,'' Barnett said. ``Los Angeles has more stations,
there's more competition, therefore the prices are lower.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Bay Area, where stations tend to be fewer and more
isolated from each other, consumers already pay more than $2 a
gallon for grades except regular unleaded, which costs about $1.90,
Kloza said.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron's Frank Gorell wouldn't predict where prices were
headed, but described current price pressures, such as the price of
crude oil, the output of refineries, demand from vacationers and
farmers doing summer planting, as a layer cake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The layers of this cake all push in the same direction,'' he
said, ``upward.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also said that a little longer than a year ago, prices
were lower than those during the Great Depression, when adjusted
for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   And Claudia Chandler, assistant executive director of the
California Energy Commission, disputed dire price predictions
because of Saudi Arabia's promise to increase production, thereby
driving down the cost to refiners. She said Saudi price cuts would
be followed by price cuts of Alaskan crude, which supplies 41
percent of California's oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the factors right now are not pointing to $2 per gallon,
barring any serious refinery problems,'' she said, such as those
that caused Northern California prices to jump 15 cents
``overnight'' last week.
</P>
<P>
   Some San Fernando Valley motorists said higher prices had
compelled them to be more selective in their buying habits,
including whether they will continue to drive sport-utility
vehicles and pickups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably get a diesel the next time I'm in the market,''
said Jim Rodnumsky, 43, as he paid $60 at Novak's Chevron to fill
up his Ford F-350, which he uses in his work for Cablecam Systems.
``It's less convenient, but I need this for my job, so I can't do
anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kloza said most motorists aren't matching their words with
actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angry motorists railing against high prices ... just has not
been followed by real action,'' he said. ``So far, it hasn't had a
significant impact on demand. People are driving just as much as
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone has benefited from the up-swing in gas prices, it is
bulk-retailer Costco, which offers gas to its members. Though lines
are long at the Van Nuys location, customers keep coming, snared by
the low prices - $1.53 per gallon for regular unleaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best deal I can find in L.A., so it's worth the
extra five minutes,'' said Brad Pressman, 33, of Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Like most customers, he's unhappy about the increase, but
willing to ride it out until the price drops down again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until they can invent an electric car that can go as fast as
my Corvette, I'll keep paying for gas.''

CATHOLIC CHURCH LOOKS TO HIKE NUMBER OF LATINO PRIESTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Also moving in the ``a'' national news file.) 
 &HT;    By STEVE CARNEY  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As Catholics from throughout the United States
gather in Los Angeles today for an unprecedented cross-cultural
get-together, they're concerned that the explosive growth of their
Latino membership isn't reflected in their priesthood.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 40 years, Latinos have accounted for 71 percent of
the growth in the Catholic Church in the United States. More than a
third of the church's total membership is now Latino, as compared
with only 4 percent of priests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The growth in the last 10 years has been so great, we haven't
been able to keep up with it,'' said Ronaldo Cruz, executive
director of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops'
Secretariat for Hispanic Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the average ratio of priests to Catholics is 1 to
1,200, while for Latino priests and parishioners it is 1 to 9,900.
</P>
<P>
   Serving that burgeoning and vital minority is only one of many
topics on the menu for Encuentro 2000, a four-day gathering that
starts today at the L.A. Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   The conference, subtitled ``Many Faces in God's House,'' and
expected to draw 4,400 church leaders and members, is the only
national gathering of its kind planned for 2000, a pivotal Jubilee
Year for the church, as decreed by Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a unique moment in the Catholic Church,'' said Sister
Mary Ann Walsh, spokeswoman for Encuentro 2000. ``It's the first
time we have called Catholics of all races and all ethnic
backgrounds together. It's a chance to look at the church and where
we are now.''
</P>
<P>
   And Los Angeles is the ideal place for that self-examination
because it's such a cross-cultural crossroads itself, with
Catholics from Cambodia, Egypt, Samoa, the Philippines, Central and
South America, Syria, Lebanon and other points around the globe all
residing here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have just about every ethnicity and every language and
every type of Catholic here,'' said Tod Tamberg, director of media
relations for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very proud of our ethnic makeup. It's a strength, and
it's really a skill to master to live as one Christian family, to
say, How do we work together, and how to we become one family?''
</P>
<P>
   Because of its large Latino Catholic population - by far the
largest in the country - Los Angeles does better than most dioceses
in serving Latino immigrants, Tamberg said. Officials from dioceses
nationwide have come calling for advice, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz said the church has three main approaches to recruit more
Latino priests: have current priests mentor potential Latino
seminarians, ask Latino families to encourage their children to
consider the priesthood, and reach out to young men directly at
colleges and high schools.
</P>
<P>
   According to a new study by the National Conference of Catholic
Bishops, 83.5 percent of church leaders surveyed said their
dioceses ``have yet to develop effective programs to reach Hispanic
youth.''
</P>
<P>
   And though Spanish-language services and Latino cultural
programs are increasing, church officials say more are needed, as
are more Latinos in leadership positions.
</P>
<P>
   If the Catholic Church doesn't cater to immigrants' needs, then
there are plenty of small evangelical churches sprouting in ethnic
communities that will - and already are.
</P>
<P>
   There's no way of telling how many immigrants who were
practicing Catholics in their home countries joined storefront
churches upon arriving in the United States. But more than half of
the bishops and other church officials surveyed in the Latino study
in 1998 called proselytism a ``very significant'' challenge,
compared with only 11.5 percent in 1990.

KREUTER BEGINS HIS SUSPENSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The two-month saga that began when Chad Kreuter
entered the stands and took part in a May 16 fight at Wrigley Field
took a major step toward a final resolution Wednesday when the Los
Angeles Dodgers catcher dropped his appeal and began serving his
eight-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter, through the players association, filed his second
appeal of the suspension when Paul Beeston, chief operating officer
for baseball, upheld Frank Robinson's original ruling last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to drop the appeal was Kreuter's, though it was
something the Dodgers wanted him to do for the past week. The
timing makes sense because of the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Todd Hundley had Monday and Tuesday off to rest him for
the five games that remained heading into the break. Kreuter will
finish serving his time by sitting out the three-game series with
the Angels after the break. He'll return July 16.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kreuter, who is also facing a civil suit, said he
believed the suspension was harsh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I needed to appeal it because I wasn't happy with
the outcome, in the first place, but I felt I needed to (serve the
suspension) because I want to be a team player and do what's best
for this ballclub,'' Kreuter said. ``I'm not happy with what has
gone on. I was on a baseball field, playing baseball, and I was
struck in the back of the head and my cap stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the victim in this thing and I've been made out to be
more of the villain. So I'm not too thrilled with how the
circumstances have turned out, especially since the guys that have
come to my aid, not all of them have been vindicated.''
</P>
<P>
   By dropping the appeal, it leaves three Dodgers with appeals
pending in Gary Sheffield, F.P. Santangelo and Carlos Perez, each
suspended five games.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield remains adamant about appealing his suspension, which
he'll do next week while he's in Atlanta at the All-Star game.
Sheffield's appeal will be heard by commissioner Bud Selig.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the players association continue to speak with
Santangelo and Perez about dropping their appeals. Two Dodgers
sources said it's likely Santangelo would drop his appeal as early
as today. A baseball official said Perez will likely drop his
appeal because he's a pitcher, and it would only cost him one
start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think (Kreuter's decision) has any affect on anyone
else,'' said Gene Orza, associate general counsel for the players
association. ``My suspicion, and it's really nothing more than
that, is the Dodgers want to move on, and I think the players want
to move past it. I think Carlos and F.P. will drop their appeals,
but in Sheffield's case, he fully plans to follow through.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the reason Kreuter appealed Beeston's decision last week
was to protect himself against a civil suit that's been filed. The
wording of the decision caused some concern, but Orza and Robert
Manfred, executive vice president of labor relations and human
resources for baseball, will meet today to change the wording.
</P>
<P>
   But Kreuter said that dropping his appeal in no way means he
agrees with the punishment. It was handed down May 24 after Kreuter
was allegedly struck in the back of his head and had his cap stolen
by a fan.
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter says he went into the stands to hold the person until
security arrived. The episode exploded into a melee for which 16
players and three coaches were suspended by Robinson, vice
president of on-field operations. Eleven players and coach Glenn
Hoffman had their suspensions overturned by Beeston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that we have a position in baseball where we
have a Hall of Famer (Robinson) that should be respected by all of
us players, who is respected as a baseball player, that he's put in
position to be a bad guy,'' Kreuter said. ``It's unfortunate
because you don't want a guy that's done what he's done in this
game to be put in that position of being the cop, or the judge and
jury of any of the things that (happen) on the field. You hate for
a guy of that stature to be in that position.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Leyritz will act as Hundley's backup, and Dave Hansen is the
emergency catcher. Hundley should be aided in that he just had two
days off and the All-Star break will give him three more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to have a whole bunch of suspension dates after
the All-Star break,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``If
Hundley wasn't healthy, I'd postpone it (by continuing the appeal).
If you have to serve it for eight days, and there's not much chance
for redemption, then you need to serve it and get it past you. I've
made no secret of that to Chad.''

STATE PANEL RECOMMENDS IMPEACHING NEW HAMPSHIRE CHIEF JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (RECASTS with other articles of impeachment, comment from Brock's
lawyer)   
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A committee of New Hampshire lawmakers voted Wednesday
night to recommend that Chief Justice David Brock of the State
Supreme Court be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to recommend impeachment of Brock on accusations
that he had committed perjury as he defended himself against
charges of ethical improprieties came on a 17-5 vote of by the
Judiciary Committee of the State House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also endorsed two other articles of impeachment
charging that Brock called a lower-court judge in 1987 in a case
involving a powerful state senator, something Brock has denied, and
that he solicited comments from a fellow justice about that
justice's divorce case, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   The full House is scheduled to decide on the committee's
recommendations on July 12. If the House votes for impeachment, the
trial, which would be the first such Supreme Court impeachment
proceeding in New Hampshire since 1790, will begin in the state
Senate in August.
</P>
<P>
   Two other articles of impeachment against Brock, one accusing
him of letting disqualified justices take part in deliberations and
the other saying the sum of his actions warranted impeachment, both
failed, The AP reported.
</P>
<P>
   The chief justice has denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Brock's lawyer, David Barry, said Wednesday night that the
committee had lowered the threshold for impeachment too far.
Historically, he said, officials have been impeached for willful
misconduct, not poor judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``An impeachment of the chief justice based on the evidence
found will stand out as a historical aberration,'' Barry was quoted
by The AP as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also decided against impeaching or reprimanding
two state Supreme Court justices, Sherman D. Horton Jr. and John T.
Broderick Jr., who were also accused of ethical missteps.
</P>
<P>
   The committee voted 19-3 against impeaching Horton and 16-6
against admonishing Broderick. Both had been accused of failing to
turn in the colleague who tried to intercede in his own divorce
case and of discussing cases from which they had recused themselves
because of possible bias.
</P>
<P>
   But state Rep. Cynthia J. Dokmo, a Republican who is one of
several lawyers on the committee, said, ``Whether we impeach them
or not, their reputations are forever damaged by this process.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire judicial crisis began with an ugly divorce,
the split between a state Supreme Court justice, W. Stephen Thayer
III, and his wife, Judith, a former chairwoman of the state Board
of Education. Judith Thayer appealed aspects of the case up to the
very court on which her former husband sat, and its justices,
unable to rule on their own colleague, had to appoint a special
panel of other judges to hear the case.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 4, according to a report by the state attorney general,
Thayer, who has since resigned, vehemently objected to the choice
of a particular judge for that panel. In response, Brock tried to
prevent the court clerk from calling that judge but was too late.
</P>
<P>
   That incident, which the court clerk reported to a judicial
conduct committee, prompted a broader inquiry into the court's
practices by the state attorney general, Philip T. McLaughlin. It
found a worrisome pattern of justices' being allowed to comment on
cases even when they had excused themselves because of potential
conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Although the court had already issued new rules on recusals, the
incident also raised strenuous protests from court critics across
the state, many of whom were already contending that the court
overstepped its bounds in a major 1997 ruling that revamped the
state's heavily local system of financing schools. Lingering anger
among lawmakers over that decision could mean trouble for Brock as
the Legislature decides his fate, political analysts here say.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the court in the Legislature moved this spring for an
inquiry into whether any justices should be impeached, and the
Judicial Committee of the House took up the question in April. It
has since heard testimony laying bare some of the innermost
workings of the court.
</P>
<P>
   Another, somewhat dusty case figured prominently in the
discussions: accusations that in 1987, Brock intervened in a case
involving a powerful state senator and commented that the senator
held some control over justices' pay raises. Brock denies making
the call.

RANGERS COMPLETE SWEEP OF A'S
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Oakland Athletics starter Mark Mulder threw
32 pitches in the first inning last night, and most of them were
pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   He walked David Segui after getting ahead 0-2 in the count, but
other than that, he pretty much had the Rangers off-balance for the
entire inning. Only a couple of balls were hit hard.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't stop the Rangers from putting together one of the
weakest seven-run rallies imaginable and riding it to a 9-4 victory
over the Athletics at The Ballpark in Arlington. The victory
allowed the Rangers to sweep the three-game series and improved
their season record to 7-2 against the second-place Athletics. The
Rangers are 33-40 against everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good start, being able to sweep these guys,'' first
baseman Rafael Palmeiro said. ``It gives us hope. It gives
everybody hope.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers also finished 6-3 in a nine-game stretch that
consisted of six against Oakland and three against the Seattle
Mariners, keeping alive their flickering hope of remaining in
contention in the American League West.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had periods like this all year,'' manager Johnny Oates
said. ``What we're looking for is two months like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers starter Kenny Rogers took advantage of the early support
to run his winning streak to six games. Rogers, who hasn't lost
since May 24 in Kansas City, allowed four runs on 10 hits in
eight-plus innings and threw 114 pitches. He's still hoping to
pitch Sunday on three days' rest against the San Diego Padres, but
Oates isn't sure.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the victory, Rogers was unhappy with the way he pitched.
A foot through a wall in the clubhouse emphasized that displeasure,
even though he raised his record to 9-5 with a 4.13 earned-run
average.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt terrible out there,'' Rogers said. ``But the offense
gave me room for error. I struggled with my location on anything I
threw. It was more them making outs than me making good pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulder threw 131 pitches. Despite the rough start, he still
managed to hang around for 62/3 innings and give up 15 hits, the
most in one game by a pitcher in the major leagues this year.
</P>
<P>
   Mulder, after striking out Luis Alicea to start the first, got
himself into trouble on what should have been a routine out. Rusty
Greer hit a grounder to first baseman Jason Giambi, who flipped to
Mulder covering the bag. But Mulder somehow barely missed stepping
on the bag, and first base umpire Brian Gorman ruled Greer safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got it with the side of my foot,'' Mulder said. ``But at the
last minute, I said, let's make sure, and when I went back to hit
it again, I missed it. So the umpire, of course, is going to think
I missed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro followed with a soft single into center that sent Greer
to third, and Ivan Rodriguez brought him home with a sacrifice fly.
Chad Curtis followed with a grounder off the third-base bag that
went for a run-scoring double. Gabe Kapler was walked
intentionally, but Mike Lamb, starting a 3-for-4 night, blooped a
single to left, scoring two runs. Scott Sheldon doubled off Jeremy
Giambi's glove in deep right to score two more. Alicea made it 7-0
with a solid double into the left-field corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really felt good,'' Mulder said. ``I was hitting my spots,
but I still gave up a seven-spot in the first inning. All I needed
was one out, and I couldn't get it. That's tough to come back from
with Kenny out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Greer, ``We hit some balls, but I don't know if more than
one or two of them were right on the screws. We had good placement
out there, but right now we'll take anything we can get.'' nn

SUDDENLY, THE YANKEES FIND THEIR LAUGHER ISN'T SO FUNNY
</HEADLINE>
  By LIZ ROBBINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The domination was clear and seemingly complete after
six innings Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees had taken a 10-0 lead over the Baltimore
Orioles, which was refreshing for a team stumbling through a summer
swoon, a team that had gone 10-15 in June and had lost its last
five games at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a 10-0 lead was like diving into a swimming pool on a
steamy day. But the Yankees lingered too long in the shallow end,
and by the end of the seventh inning, they were sweating again,
their lead down to just 10-6. But the Yankees bounced back to score
two runs in the eighth, and they eventually wiped their brows with
a 12-6 victory over the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Yankees desperately needed the victory, which put
them four games above .500 at 41-37 and moved them within a
half-game of first-place Toronto in the American League East, the
Orioles' six-run seventh inning exposed their weaknesses in the
bullpen again.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' newly named All-Stars Derek Jeter and Bernie
Williams were scorching. Williams extended his hitting streak to 15
games and instigated the scoring barrages with leadoff doubles in
the second and sixth innings. Jeter made typically astounding
throws from the shortstop hole and then homered in the fifth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Pettitte (9-4), who pitched a complete-game shutout against
Detroit in his last outing, was dominating Wednesday night through
six shutout innings. Pettitte, who has won four of his last six
starts, left with one out in the seventh, but not before he had
given up a two-run home run to Charles Johnson, a triple to Luis
Matos and a walk to Brady Anderson. That was enough for manager Joe
Torre as he took Pettitte out to the roar of the 40,031 fans who
appreciated the value of a solid outing.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander Jason Grimsley, whom Torre had mentioned as a
strong possibility to start Saturday's day game against the Mets at
Shea Stadium, relieved Pettitte. But Grimsley heard a much
different reaction when he walked off the mound after recording
just one out, hanging his head to boos.
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley gave up a run-scoring single to Mike Bordick, the first
batter he faced, then outfielder B.J. Surhoff cracked a double that
scored Bordick. Albert Belle drove in a run with a groundout and
Jeff Conine singled Surhoff home for the sixth run of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Torre called for the left-hander Mike Stanton. Will Clark
singled on his only pitch for his second hit of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander Jeff Nelson finally snuffed the rally. Johnson
slapped a ground ball that ricocheted off Nelson's foot, and Jeter
collected it and rifled to second for the force.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth inning, Pettitte escaped the only other danger he
faced. He walked Johnson, and Mark Lewis slapped a ground ball deep
into the hole at shortstop. But Jeter was there, and he threw
across his body to get Johnson at second.

KILLER ALGAE BLOOMS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAGOON
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ A noxious species of ``killer algae'' that has
destroyed marine life across thousands of acres of the
Mediterranean seabed has now invaded a coastal lagoon near San
Diego and threatens to spread swiftly unless the fast-growing pest
can be controlled.
<P>
   A task force of scientists from federal and state wildlife
agencies, joined by other environmental specialists, is testing
techniques to wipe out the invading algae before the dangerous
bright green weed spreads along the California coast.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have compared the spread of the invading algae to
``unrolling a carpet of Astro Turf across the bottom of the sea,''
causing ``ecological and economic devastation'' in its path.
</P>
<P>
   The deadly pest was detected last month by divers monitoring the
growth of transplanted eel grass in a program to restore a lagoon
beside the Cabrillo Power Co. plant in Carlsbad, about 20 miles
north of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe that a strain of the nasty plant, known
scientifically as Caulerpa taxifolia, was first cultivated years
ago by biologists at the Stuttgart zoo aquarium in Germany because
it made a highly decorative cover for the aquarium's artificial
ocean bottom.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, the evidence indicates, clones of the same invading
species apparently were dumped into the Mediterranean from the
Monaco aquarium, and the algae began its swift attack. From an
original patch of less than a square yard, the infestation spread
wildly, covering more than 1,000 acres by 1992 and 10,000 acres by
last year, with patches of the weed established along the
Mediterranean coast of France, Spain and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Before the lagoon invasion was discovered in California three
weeks ago, the aggressive weed was unknown anywhere along the
coasts of North and South America, according to Andrew N. Cohen, a
marine biologist at the San Francisco Estuary Institute in
Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   The importation or sale of the invasive algae was banned last
year in an executive order from President Clinton. But in a
telephone briefing from San Diego Wednesday, Robert Hoffman of the
National Marine Fisheries Service warned that clumps of the algae
are still being sold to hobbyists by aquarium dealers. Dumping the
contents of home saltwater aquariums into storm sewers _ a common
practice _ could threaten to spread disaster for coastal marine
life, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1998 letter to Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt that
triggered the federal ban _ two years before the plant was first
detected in the Carlsbad lagoon _ nearly 100 environmental
scientists warned Babbitt that the algae can grow almost anywhere
in the ocean down to depths of 250 feet and on sandy and rocky sea
bottoms in both protected bays and along rocky coasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allowing the release of this organism into the Mediterranean
was an act of environmental mismanagement that threatens
catastrophic changes and the loss of biological diversity in one of
the most valued marine ecosystems,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This killer algae smothers local aquatic plants just as
effectively as if we had bulldozed them out,'' said Linda Sheehan,
Pacific region director of the Center for Marine Conservation, a
national environmental group.
</P>
<P>
   In the Carlsbad lagoon, one thick patch of the invading algae
now covers an area about 30 by 60 feet, while nine other small
patches are growing around it, according to Hoffman. The thick turf
covers all kinds of bottom-dwelling life _ including native
seaweeds, corals, sponges, and many species of clams, shrimp and
small fish, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the seaweed is harmless to humans, it contains a toxin
that can interfere with the eggs of many marine animals and can
kill many microscopic marine organisms.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists from the government and private agencies working
now to wipe out the invasion in the Carlsbad lagoon are testing
several chemicals they hope will work, Hoffman said. The plan is to
cover each of the nine small patches of algal turf with tarpaulins
and then drench the area with either copper sulfate or chlorine.
</P>
<P>
   The attack will kill everything living within the patch, Hoffman
said, but just how the larger invaded area can be cleansed remains
a question. In any event, he said, the team hopes to start
attacking the invasion within the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Caulerpa invasion in the lagoon was first identified by
marine biologist Rachel Woodfield, who works for Merkel &AMP;
Associates, a San Diego environmental consulting firm employed by
the power company to oversee the lagoon restoration project.
</P>
<P>
   In the Mediterranean, fishing nets and boat anchors have spread
the invasion. ``Even a tiny piece of the algae broken off can
regenerate a new plant, making eradication by mechanical means
nearly impossible,'' Woodfield said.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition of agencies trying to stem the invasion in the
Carlsbad lagoon urged the public Wednesday to notify any local
office of the California Department of Fish and Game if the algae
species is observed anywhere along the coast.

TURNAROUND OF PARADE SHIPS IS DEFENDED 
</HEADLINE>
  (CORRECTS to OpSail in grafs 2,3,7)  
 By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An official of the Fourth of July Parade of Sails on
Wednesday defended decisions by two captains to turn 27 tall ships
around before reaching Upper Manhattan, a move that disappointed
thousands of eager spectators.
</P>
<P>
   The defense came as Mayor Rudolph Giuliani suggested that the
organizers of OpSail may have barely managed to execute the whole
event.
</P>
<P>
   The captains of the Eagle, from the U.S. Coast Guard, and the
Cisne Branco, from Brazil, led separate turnarounds of two lines of
ships on the Hudson River, said Gregory Perrin, vice president of
OpSail, the nonprofit group that put on the event.
</P>
<P>
   Both captains turned around farther south than scheduled to make
sure their ships had time to dock safely, before the tides changed,
he said. The other tall ships followed their lead.
</P>
<P>
   But one OpSail executive, Paul Welling, a retired Coast Guard
vice admiral, said that while the dozen ships docking on the East
River had to turn around early to take advantage of ideal tidal
conditions, those docking on the Hudson should not have had to turn
around.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people in Upper Manhattan and northern New Jersey
were let down when the full parade did not go all the way up to the
George Washington Bridge as they had expected. Most of the
four-masted Class A ships measured more than 300 feet in length and
were the most impressive in the parade.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference at P.S. 48 in the Washington Heights
section of Manhattan, Giuliani declined to address the turnaround,
but said that there were tensions between the city and OpSail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not have the greatest relationship with OpSail, so I am
not about to defend them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did note from the complaints that I got from the people who
worked with OpSail that this was not a terribly well-managed
operation. Now, they pulled it off, it worked. But there were times
in which it almost looked like it wasn't going to work at all.''
</P>
<P>
   But Perrin said that ``all the operations went off without a
hitch.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the turnaround, the captains could have been reacting to
a number of variables, including currents and wind conditions, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The captain of a vessel is ultimately responsible for the
safety of that vessel,'' Perrin said. ``Whatever variables came
into play, OpSail is not in a position to question the decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The captains wanted to get their ships to their berths during
slack water, an eight-minute window of time when the tide is not
coming in or going out, Perrin said. On the East River especially,
the water can be treacherous at other times, and tall ships cannot
be maneuvered easily into the narrow piers.
</P>
<P>
   Welling said that if the dozen ships docking on the East River
had missed slack water, they would have had to wait several hours
for the tide to shift and then use tug boats.

 CALIFORNIA FUMBLES OVERSIGHT OF PRISON INMATES' MEDICAL TESTS  &HT;     By SABIN RUSSELL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO _ A California laboratory that processed medical
tests for thousands of state prisoners in the 1990s was shut down
by health inspectors in 1997 for faking results on screens for
AIDS, hepatitis and other serious diseases.
<P>
   But more than three years later, there is little evidence of any
attempt by the California Department of Corrections to retest
inmates or notify them that their test results were faked, a
Chronicle investigation has found.
</P>
<P>
   Without retesting, potentially thousands of prison inmates who
had lab work done by B.C.L. Clinical Labs could have lacked crucial
information about their health and missed beneficial treatments.
They also could have infected other inmates or could have been
released back into society with diseases they did not know they
had.
</P>
<P>
   Prompted by The Chronicle's inquiry in March, Department of
Corrections authorities are looking into the matter but have yet to
turn up documents describing any retesting plan.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Donna Wilson, chief of quality programs for the department's
Health Care Services Division, said she believes individual prison
medical officers took the appropriate steps to retest any prisoners
whose health was in question.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I hope we will be able to document is that they did
undergo an organized approach to appropriately retest,'' said
Wilson, who has worked for the department since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But a review of the records of more than a dozen female inmates
shows only two cases of retesting. One woman was given another HIV
test 13 months after her initial test, and another woman was
retested for a thyroid condition but not for other possible
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Prison rights attorneys who learned about the B.C.L. case from
The Chronicle said they doubt any retesting was ever undertaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really unconscionable,'' said Donna Willmott,
litigation coordinator for Legal Services for Prisoners with
Children, a San Francisco law office for low-income women inmates.
</P>
<P>
   The closing of B.C.L. Clinical Labs, situated in the Los Angeles
suburb of Santa Fe Springs, is described in federal and state
documents obtained by The Chronicle through state Public Records
Act requests.
</P>
<P>
   They reveal for the first time how a reckless medical testing
laboratory _ which had been warned by prison officials for late and
shoddy work since 1995 _ won low-bid contracts to run thousands of
medical tests on state prisoners and faked the results in a scam
inspectors call ``dry-labbing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tipped off by the chief medical officer at Chuckawala Valley
State Prison in Imperial County, inspectors paid a surprise visit
to B.C.L. labs on Dec. 10, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   They found a jumble of idle equipment. There was evidence that
lab operators were simply making up results on vital medical tests
for thousands of prisoners _ tests for AIDS, hepatitis and cancer _
and typing them into a computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we caught them with their hand in the cookie jar,''
said Tom Barr, an investigator for the Laboratory Field Services
branch of the California Department of Health Services.
</P>
<P>
   Under its authority to regulate medical laboratories, the
federal Department of Health and Human Services suspended B.C.L.'s
license in January 1997 and revoked it on May 1, 1997. The
company's owner and manager, Parveena Ahkter, and her brother,
Ayazur Rahman, were fined $20,000 but are believed by investigators
to have fled the country shortly after the lab was raided.
</P>
<P>
   Seven state prisons received notices from federal regulators in
March 1997 warning that the problems at B.C.L. labs posed
``immediate jeopardy'' to patients.
</P>
<P>
   Lab results ``may not represent an accurate diagnosis of your
patients' condition and may require immediate follow-up,
particularly in the area of Pap smears and HIV testing,'' the
notice said. ``This information is being provided to you to enable
you to make an informed decision regarding patient retesting and
future testing.''
</P>
<P>
   Prisons notified were: Northern California Women's Facility,
Stockton; Calipatria State Prison, Calipatria; Lancaster State
Prison, Los Angeles; Chuckawala Valley State Prison and Ironwood
State Prison, Blythe; Central California's Women's Facility,
Chowchilla; and Deuel Vocational Institute, Tracy.
</P>
<P>
   The Corrections Department's Wilson said there may be no
directives from top department administrators to retest inmates
because medical decisions were delegated to each prison. ``The
contracts were institution-specific,'' she said. ``... Any and all
problems would been have handled by each institution.''
</P>
<P>
   At one facility, Chuckawala Valley State Prison, prison doctors
sent some test samples to local hospitals to be reprocessed after
the doctors realized they could not rely on B.C.L. test results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone, from the doctors and nurses on down, was fully aware
of the problem with B.C.L,'' said Dr. John Culton, Chuckawala's
chief medical officer. ``We'd gotten to the point where we were
looking for errors and were retesting anything that seemed
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Culton said he urged state health inspectors to check out the
company. He believes any prisoner whose lab results were suspect
was retested at his facility. But he acknowledged that he never put
any formal ``cleanup'' work down in writing.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is clear: Any program to retest would have been
large-scale and costly.
</P>
<P>
   One of the prison facilities, Central California Women's
Facility, calls itself the nation's largest women's prison, with
2,600 inmates. Records show that from July to November 1996, just
before it was closed, B.C.L. labs billed the facility $161,000 for
thousands of medical tests, including Pap smears to detect cervical
cancer, AIDS tests, biopsies and urinalyses.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Department of Corrections authorities have been unable to
produce records showing that the state prison system took any steps
to retest those prisoners whose test results were suddenly called
into question.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of The Chronicle, staff members at Legal Services
for Prisoners with Children examined medical records of 100 women
inmates at Central California Women's Facility and Valley State
Prison, both in Chowchilla.
</P>
<P>
   The records were from an unrelated case brought by the San
Francisco group against the Department of Corrections alleging
inferior medical care of inmates. The case was settled and resulted
in an agreement by the prison systems to adhere to a new set of
rules for caring for prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The review turned up the charts of 13 women who had medical
tests conducted by B.C.L. in the six months before it closed. Only
two of the charts showed any evidence of retesting _ that of a
woman who had a second HIV test nine months after B.C.L was raided
and another of a woman who was retested for a thyroid condition but
not for other problems.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Corey Weinstein, a San Francisco physician who consults with
advocacy groups on prison medical issues, said that if more women
had been retested, it would have been reflected in their files.
``If it's not on the charts, it didn't happen,'' he said. ``Medical
professionals are taught: You write everything down.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein said it would not surprise him if no retesting was
done anywhere in the system after the warnings. ``These medical
staffs tend to be very demoralized. They are not involved with the
patients in a way that would protect them from this kind of
malfeasance by another provider.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how long B.C.L. had been faking medical test
results. But a search of Department of Corrections records shows
that B.C.L. was identified as a poor performer as early as July
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators at Robert J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San
Diego warned the new lab only 11 days after it started what was to
have been a yearlong contract for up to $100,000 in testing
services. Among the complaints: A doctor had found 20 spelling
errors in a standard form B.C.L. provided to check off tests
performed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of lab are we dealing with?'' scrawled a Donovan
staff member in a worried memo to the chief lab technician.
</P>
<P>
   After repeated warnings and complaints, the contract was
terminated on Aug. 28, 1995, for failure to provide testing
materials as promised and failure to report test results in a
timely manner. California State Prison in Sacramento dropped B.C.L.
for similar reasons in October 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not stop other California prisons from signing up
B.C.L., which sometimes bid for the state business at half the
price charged by competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The December 10 inspection uncovered shocking conditions at
B.C.L. labs. Documents obtained by The Chronicle describe a
laboratory in disarray, with testing equipment that didn't work,
was out-of-calibration or lacked proper reagents for conducting
tests of blood and urine. At one point during the inspection,
investigators asked a technician to start one of the machines, a
Hitachi blood chemistry analyzer. When the machine was turned on,
it began to pour fluid onto the floor. ``We were all standing in
reagents,'' said Barr.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Health Services considered criminal charges
against the labs' operators, but no one was ever prosecuted.
Indeed, the two-year sanction imposed on B.C.L. labs by federal
authorities would, in theory, have permitted the operators to
reopen for business in April 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Oh, for the simple life of a sailor _ being battered
by storms, struggling with broken equipment, subsisting largely on
dried bread.
</P>
<P>
   After three hectic days in New York, the crew of the Ukrainian
schooner Bat'kivshchyna, the little ship that almost didn't make it
to OpSail 2000, seemed to have grown a little weary &UR;  &LR; of
semi-celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like New York,'' Vadim Biriukovich, at 14 the youngest
member of the crew, said on Wednesday as an endless line of
tourists waited to clamber aboard and hand him $15 for a
Bat'kivshchyna T-shirt. ``But sometimes when you get sick of the
people, it's pressure on you and you want to be somewhere alone.
Also, I am getting homesick. But I'm not complaining.''
</P>
<P>
   His grandfather and the captain of the ship, Dmytro Biriukovich,
was also doing his best not to complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is great, better than small town,'' the captain said
as he was hustled off the boat, docked at West 44th Street just
below the carrier Intrepid, to attend a reception at the Ukrainian
consulate, ``but I'm tired here.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, New York has been very, very good business
for the grossly underfinanced Bat'kivshchyna (pronounced
bat-keev-SHIN-a), which endured a three-month, 8,000-mile voyage
involving pretty much every hardship between stem and stern to take
part in Tuesday's grand Parade of Sail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need these T-shirts!'' Roy Kellogg, the captain's
son-in-law, barked into a borrowed cell phone. ``We need them now!
He's sending us partial shipments.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Kellogg, a Canadian-born public relations
consultant who has been coordinating the voyage from on land,
emerged with big news.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally found a sponsor,'' he announced, and introduced
Andrei Hartt, the U.S. importer of Soomska Ukrainian vodka, winner
of two of the four top spots in the most recent Beverage Trade
Institute competition in the flavored vodka category.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsorship deal involves an undisclosed amount of cash and
a large amount of merchandise, Kellogg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's provided three cases right now for New York,'' Kellogg
said, ``and will supply a party of 500 people with vodka _ that's
about 250 bottles _ in Connecticut, and provide vodka in Halifax
and Portland.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a huge sponsorship,'' Kellogg added, ``but the crew
will love the vodka. That's why we're selling T-shirts: to get the
crew vodka. You should see how much they drink.''
</P>
<P>
   The little sightseeing that crew members have had time for has
been mostly a blur.
</P>
<P>
   ``The buildings here fantastic,'' said Gena Vovk, the souvenir
concessionaire. ``Times Square is unbelievable. And I saw a nice
dog made of flowers, in Rockefeller Center.''
</P>
<P>
   In the four days' shore leave he has left, Vadim Biriukovich
said he hoped to visit the Virgin Megastore in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to find the Sex Pistols' album for what they won the
award on MTV,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The pomp of the Fourth of July seemed to have made little
impression on him. ``I don't want to lie to you,'' he said when
asked about Tuesday night's fireworks. ``I expected some kind of
picture _ something like `2000' or maybe American flag.''
</P>
<P>
   But Katya Dvornichenko, a crew member and 21-year-old philology
student, was more than contented.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my dream to see fireworks above the Statue of
Liberty,'' she said. ``I saw that. Now since that time I have no
more dreams. I do not know what to dream now.''

 FOX URGED TO PLACE ENVIRONMENT HIGH ON AGENDA  &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Earlier this year, as Vicente Fox revved up his
campaign for president, few people paid attention to his
increasingly frequent promises to include ecological considerations
at nearly every stage of government.
</P>
<P>
   A conservative, pro-business candidate who is also an
environmentalist? Ridiculous, just empty rhetoric, more of Fox's
usual moralizing, critics said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after Fox's surprise victory in Sunday's election, Mexicans
are taking a second look _ and many are concluding that he may turn
out to be the country's most green-friendly president ever.
</P>
<P>
   Since his triumph, Fox has repeated and expanded on his pledges
to end Mexico's severe problems with air and water pollution,
making mention of the issues in nearly every speech and interview.
</P>
<P>
   But a backlash has started _ ironically enough, from some
environmental groups, while business leaders, who would stand to be
hurt by stepped-up enforcement of pollution controls, have been
virtually mum on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Harsh criticism is raining down on the small Green Ecologist
Party, which joined with Fox's National Action Party (PAN) to form
the Alliance for Change that swept him to victory. The Green
Party's leader, Jorge Gonzalez Torres, has long been controversial
among Mexico's small yet vocal environmental community, and
speculation that Fox might anoint him czar of Mexico's
environmental ministry disturbs some.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez Torres was almost inseparable from Fox on the campaign
trail, appearing at countless rallies. At Fox's victory celebration
Sunday night, the Green leader was at his elbow and gave his
introductory speech.
</P>
<P>
   He is one of the key advisers who have influenced Fox to adopt
an environmental stance that advocates:
</P>
<P>
   -- A substantial increase in funding and new policing powers for
PROFEPA, the agency that investigates and enforces pollution laws.
</P>
<P>
   -- A sharp reduction in logging of old-growth forests, and an
increase in commercial reforestation.
</P>
<P>
   -- Inclusion of pollution as a negative cost when calculating
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   -- Special tax breaks to industry for installing environmental
controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will make Mexico's environment, its water and forests, a
national-security issue,'' Fox said Tuesday. ``We will turn around
the concept of development to include the environment as a factor
in economic and social decisions _ not as a separate sector, but as
an essential element in creating sustainable economic and social
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Gonzalez Torres says he maintains close links with the
U.S. Green Party and praises its presidential candidate, Ralph
Nader, his party is much more centrist and cautious than its
northern counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   Many critics say Gonzalez Torres _ who ran for president in 1994
but received only 1.5 percent of the vote _ is more small-time
political operator than environmentalist.
</P>
<P>
   There have been suspicions for years that the formation of the
Green Ecologist Party was aided and abetted by former President
Carlos Salinas as a tactic for dividing voters opposed to the
long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). Gonzalez
Torres also has been criticized for running his party in an
authoritarian manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Green Party has never been known for taking strong
ecological stands, and for that reason no major Mexican
environmentalists are members,'' said Alejandro Calvillo, director
of Greenpeace Mexico. ``If Gonzalez Torres is given a major role in
the government it will be a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, a coalition of 65 environmental groups went further,
calling Gonzalez Torres an ``opportunist'' and warning that his
party had ``usurped'' the environmental cause.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez Torres is highly controversial even within Fox's inner
circle, with some advisers trying to veto him from any job in the
new government. ``It would be a tragedy if he is named to any
important position,'' one top Fox adviser, who requested anonymity,
said last night.
</P>
<P>
   Others defend him, arguing that many of his critics have tight
links with the PRI and with government environmental authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Green Party is not perfect, but it has played a
constructive role in many issues,'' said Homero Aridjis, president
of the Group of 100 and Mexico's best-known environmentalist.
</P>
<P>
   Aridjis cited the role of Green Party congressional legislators
in forcing President Ernesto Zedillo to halt a controversial salt
extraction project by Mitsubishi Corp. in whale wintering areas in
Baja California.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening now is a political offensive, as many people
are fighting over government power in the new administration _
keeping their jobs, getting new ones, getting a piece of the pie,''
Aridjis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what's important now is that Fox has shown a real
sensitivity toward environmental issues,'' he added. ``I'm very
enthusiastic about the new administration. Fox could really help
solve Mexico's horrible pollution problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez Torres said he is being attacked merely because his
often-lonely, 20-year campaign to inject environmentalism into
mainstream politics has finally been successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been at the forefront of these issues for many years,
and now there is a great possibility that Mexico will have its
first environmentalist government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he hopes to influence the Fox administration to
increase support for mass transit, electric vehicles, environmental
education in public schools and cooperation with the United States
to clean up pollution along the border.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez Torres rejects the charges of political opportunism,
noting that his party has never flinched in its animal-rights
crusade to stop bullfighting and hunting. The crusade has been
highly unpopular in macho Mexico, and Fox has declined to endorse
it _ although his coalition's congressional candidates reluctantly
agreed to forsake bullfight appearances during this year's election
race.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not Gonzalez Torres gets a top job in the new regime,
his Green Party will likely have considerable influence. By running
on the same parliamentary election list as Fox's PAN, the Green
Party will reap a big harvest of seats in the new Congress _ five
in the Senate and 16 in the Chamber of Deputies.

TMS EXPECTED TO ADD CART RACE TO 2001 SCHEDULE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The addition of a Championship Auto Racing
Teams open-wheel race to the 2001 schedule at Texas Motor Speedway
will be announced Tuesday, an industry source said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   TMS has booked a news conference for a ``major announcement''
regarding next season at The Movie Studios at Las Colinas in
Irving. Bruton Smith, the owner of TMS and chairman of Speedway
Motorsports Inc., is scheduled to attend. The source said that
Bobby Rahal, CART's interim president and chief executive officer,
also would attend.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Gossage, vice president and general manager of TMS, would
not confirm that CART was poised to join the track's lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of weeks ago, I said the next time I had anything to
say on the record \Rabout CART\S, it would be that they're either
coming or not coming here,'' Gossage said. ``So, we'll be on the
record Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   The addition of CART to the TMS schedule would make it the first
facility to play host to both the FedEx Championship Series and the
rival Indy Racing Northern Light Series. The Indy Racing League has
competed at TMS since its inaugural season of 1997. Last month,
Gossage and IRL founder Tony George signed a sanctioning agreement
that will continue to give TMS the first race after the
Indianapolis 500 in June and the season finale each year through
2004.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already have one of the busiest schedules in the country
that any superspeedway has,'' Gossage said. ``As we sit here, we
already have announced our Winston Cup weekend \Rfor 2001\S, two
IRL dates and the American Le Mans Series. We've got four major
weekends already. It goes back to what we've always said, that this
wasn't going to be just another speedway.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of a race in this market, CART historically has
posted strong TV ratings in Fort Worth-Dallas. Gossage and former
CART president and CEO Andrew Craig negotiated on a CART date in
the summer of 1996. But a variety of issues _ including the extreme
speeds generated by CART's turbocharged V-8 engines through TMS'
24-degree banked turns _ prompted Gossage to go with the IRL.
</P>
<P>
   Talks between TMS and CART accelerated after Craig's resignation
from the post of president and CEO on June 16. Rahal, a team owner
and member of CART's Board of Directors, was appointed Craig's
interim replacement by his fellow board members. Rahal could not be
reached for comment yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after taking over for Craig, Rahal said, ``Job one is
the schedule. Job one, day-to-day, is to raise the level of
awareness of open-wheel racing in this country, especially CART
racing.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day Rahal replaced Craig, Gossage said he would contact
Rahal and extend an invitation for CART to race at the 1.5-mile
quadoval.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not had any meetings with Rahal or anybody in CART. I
haven't been up there \RTroy, Mich.\S and they haven't been down
here,'' Gossage said yesterday. ``That does not mean that I haven't
had telephone conversations. I'm trying not to say anything. But
it's just a real exciting time right now for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Rahal said last month that he wanted to have the series' four
engine manufacturers look into ways of reducing horsepower to
provide a better show on the series' oval tracks.
</P>
<P>
   CART currently races on a temporary 1.527-mile street circuit in
downtown Houston. The Texaco Havoline Grand Prix of Houston is
scheduled for Oct. 1 as Round 18 of a 20-race schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Rahal announced last month that CART would not return in 2001 to
either the Homestead-Miami Speedway, near Miami, or Gateway
International Raceway, near St. Louis. Both are oval tracks.
</P>
<P>
   An industry source said CART was looking to schedule an early to
midseason date at TMS.
</P>
<P>
   Homestead served as the 2000 season opener, on March 26. But
such a late-March date would put a 2001 CART race into close
proximity to the NASCAR Busch Grand National and Winston Cup
weekend at TMS. Those races are scheduled for March 31-April 1,
2001.
</P>
<P>
   This year's final CART event at Gateway International Raceway is
scheduled for Sept. 17. While that would fit TMS weather-wise, a
mid-September date would put a CART race in proximity to the 2001
IRL season-ender, scheduled for Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   CART also has announced the addition of a race in Mexico for
next season, and is rumored to be heading to Germany and England
for oval-track events. With those additions and that of TMS, CART
could operate with a 22-race schedule next season.
</P>
<P>
   That would be consistent with the plan Rahal outlined last
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the need to go beyond 20 races,'' said Rahal, a
three-time series champion and winner of the 1986 Indy 500. ``I
think ultimately 20 to 24 races is possible. A lot of good circuits
are interested in hosting us. We have to start aligning ourselves
in stronger markets here and overseas as well.''

   &UR; INTERNATIONAL _ (Moved in ``i'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE-CHEAP-GASOLINE (London) _ Paul Cheringou, a Frenchman,
gets his in Spain. In London, Ken Reddy, a Briton, prefers to pop
over _ or rather under _ the Channel to France for his. And in
Berlin, Monika Brauer, a German, finds Poland a favored venue for
hers. What these cross-border voyagers have in common is the quest
for (relatively) cheap gasoline. And what drives them to traverse
international frontiers just to fill the tank is one of Europe's
most pervasive yet surreptitious taxes. By Alan Cowell.

<P>
   RACE-HIP-HOP (Undated) _ Billy Wimsatt, 27, was born as rap
music was being invented by blacks and Latinos in the South Bronx.
What began as party music became their cry of ghetto pain and their
great hope for a way out. And as hip-hop blossomed into the radiant
center of youth culture, Billy Wimsatt and lots of other white kids
found in it a way to flee their own orderly world by discovering a
sexier, more provocative one. Elliott Wilson, a young black man,
had never met Billy Wimsatt, but their lives had traced similar
trajectories across the hip-hop landscape. By N.R. Kleinfield. (The

   CALIF-PRISONS (Los Angeles) _ The California state prison
system, which led the huge national prison-building boom for years,
has recorded the first decline in its inmate population in more
than two decades, according to state officials. The drop, although
tiny, has already caused some officials to say that it is time for
California to temporarily halt a prison buildup that inspired other
states across the country, and had a big impact on the state
budget. By Don Terry.

   &UR; CAMPAIGN _ (Moved in ``p'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   GORE-GUNS (Washington) _ This year, Al Gore has placed gun
control front and center in his campaign. He has attacked George W.
Bush as a pawn of the NRA and proposed an array of tough laws,
including licensing new handgun buyers, limiting gun sales to one a
month and banning inexpensive and easily concealed handguns. But in
promoting his own gun agenda, Gore's campaign has largely
air-brushed away an early record in Congress of fighting
gun-control legislation. Gore and his supporters argue that his
embrace of gun control was a heart-felt response to a rising tide
of gun violence in the late 1980s. Gore himself credits Mrs. Brady
_ whose husband, James, was partially paralyzed by a bullet meant
for President Reagan _ with helping to change his views. A review
of Gore's record over 24 years suggests that his journey through
the gun-control wars has been more complicated than either side
admits. By James Dao.

wealthy people whose philanthropy is directed at sweeping change
and who usually choose to start a new charity, said Paul G.
Schervish, director of the Social Welfare Research Institute at
Boston College. But this kind of giving is now spreading among the

Increasingly, it looks as if old-economy principles are saving the

between North and South Korea has waned considerably in the few
weeks since their leaders held a summit and a symbolic truckload of
Coca-Cola crossed the DMZ, heralding potential economic and
investment opportunities. Experts say it will take more than
tempting products or business plans to get Pyongyang to grant

</P>

   BRITAIN-EURO (London) _ Under pressure from business over its
indecision over joining the euro, Britain has rejected claims that
foreign companies are withdrawing or reducing their investments in

warehouse where it keeps costumes fearing that Ron Protas, its
former artistic director, would take them. Protas, whom Graham
herself chose, is working to prevent the company from performing
any of Graham's dances. Many of the troupe's 17 members have been

starting with the apartment Ms. Bohn was living in when Mr. Fiore
met her 21 years ago. Three years ago, they took on their riskiest
project. They bought a bank. The gamble was a true test of personal
and professional ties. Only the stout of heart would spend $2
million on a 1907 Beaux-Arts bank, with landmark status and an

his own home here, some 50 miles east of Washington, was almost his
undoing. On the lawn behind the house lie several 30-foot-long
curved steel girders. Has Moore acquired a Richard Serra sculpture?
``Actually,'' he explained, ``those are some of the pieces that
didn't work.'' Pieces, that is, of Moore's house, in which 77
girders _ many of which are curved and all of which were usable
only if correctly formed to within one-sixteenth of an inch _
collide. Assembling the house, in a style Moore has dubbed
``industrial baroque,'' took more than nails. As Moore's wife,
Patricia, observed, ``Other people have a family doctor; we have a
family welder.'' By Fred Bernstein.

EDITORIAL: A FINE FOURTH, WITH ONE FLAW  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, July 6:
</P>
<P>
   It was a day of tall ships, mighty explosions and big numbers.
To begin with, there were more than 30,000 craft of all sizes in
New York Harbor and adjoining waters, including 300 military
vessels and 27 spectacular tall ships that a lot of people did not
get to see. There were a million spectators, thousands of sailors,
12,000 cops, and one president. At the end of the day, 60,324
shells _ 150 tons of pyrotechnics in all _ were fired into the air
on both sides of Manhattan Island, providing a deafening
exclamation point to the biggest Fourth of July celebration the
city has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   There were some touching moments. On the carrier John F.
Kennedy, Attorney General Janet Reno swore in 19 new U.S. citizens,
including Rosa Norales-Nunez, a crew member and native of Honduras.
Norales-Nunez was chosen to introduce President Clinton, who then
reciprocated with a message of welcome and a plea to all Americans
``never to close the golden door behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   As was true of earlier OpSails, the tall ships provided the
day's centerpiece _ and, this time around, its biggest
disappointment. The Indonesian barque Dewaruci reached New York via
the Indian Ocean, the Red Sea, the Mediterranean and the North
Atlantic _ but, like the rest of the really big ships, could not
muster the energy to make it as far as the George Washington
Bridge. The bridge had been widely advertised by the organizers of
OpSail as the flotilla's eventual destination, and thousands of
people gathered in Harlem and at upriver locations on the New
Jersey side to see these majestic giants sail by. But many of the
big ships, led by the Eagle, a U.S. training vessel, began turning
around at about 47th Street. Some went farther, but none reached
the bridge.
</P>

   OpSail officials said that the prospect of unfavorable tides had
raised fears that the big ships would not make it back to their
berths. But tides are not all that difficult to predict. In the
future, the organizers should either start the procession at a
different time or be a bit more honest in their advertising. It was
one glitch in an otherwise glorious day.

<P>
   You know that baseball has expanded too much when you can fill a
32-man All-Star roster and still leave quite a few worthy players
off the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees manager Joe Torre was able to swell his American League
roster for Tuesday's game to 32 by selecting replacements for the
injured Pedro Martinez and Manny Ramirez, yet he still couldn't
find a way to get the White Sox's Frank Thomas, armed with a robust
.340 average, 25 home runs and 75 runs batted in, on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the requirement of at least one player from each team,
Torre gave berths to Tampa first baseman Fred McGriff (.272
average) and Minnesota outfielder Matt Lawton. First base is a deep
spot in the A.L. this year, which makes one wince at McGriff's
selection.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Giambi deservedly won the fan voting and becomes the
second former Dirtbag in the game (Steve Trachsel was the first),
and Toronto's Carlos Delgado and Kansas City's Mike Sweeney are
also having big years. Jim Thome, who finished second in fan
voting, wasn't selected, and Mo Vaughn and Rafael Palmeiro were
also bypassed.
</P>
<P>
   With Cal Ripken's status for the game undecided, Torre handed
two reserve spots to the Angels' Troy Glaus (deserved) and the
Indians' Travis Fryman (marginal). Toronto's Tony Batista might
have been more deserving than Fryman.
</P>
<P>
   Torre also selected his own catcher, Jorge Posada, when the
Orioles' Charles Johnson might have been more deserving.
</P>
<P>
   The N.L. decision-making reflected the game's locale, Atlanta,
and the person doing the picking, Braves manager Bobby Cox. It's
safe to say there were pitchers more deserving of a bid than Tom
Glavine (Florida's Alfonso Alfonseca) and outfielders more
deserving than Andrew Jones (Steve Finley).
</P>
<P>
   Four players earned berths by nature of the must-have team rule:
Mike Lieberthal (Philadelphia), Ryan Dempster (Florida), Shane
Reynolds (Houston) and Bob Wickman (Milwaukee). The Padres' lone
bidwent to Trevor Hoffman, who was deserving.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest oversight was Florida second baseman Luis Castillo,
who is hitting .351 with 35 steals, but there's a logjam of great
N.L. second basemen this season. Jeff Kent, Edgardo Alfonzo and
Jose Vidro are all deserving. It would have been nice to see the
Padres third baseman and ex-Fullerton star Phil Nevin make the
team, but he hit under .200 in June. ...
</P>
<P>
   The fans deserve a lot of credit for voting non-traditional
candidates like Giambi and Dye into the A.L. starting lineup. Cal
Ripken and Ken Griffey Jr. earned spots on their rep, which is
understandable and tolerable. ...
</P>
<P>
   Glaus and Darin Erstad deserve their berths on the A.L. team,
but it's still amazing to realize all-time Angel Tim Salmon has
never been on the A.L. All-Star team. ...
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield and Kevin Brown of the Dodgers are also
deserving, especially Sheffield, who is having a career season. But
he also isn't turned on by these things (neither is Brown), and it
would have been nice to see Eric Karros, who has comparable power
numbers, make his first All-Star team. ...
</P>
<P>
   One way to get around this problem is to eliminate the one
team/one-man concept when it comes to selecting the 30-man roster.
One player from each team without a representative could then be
added. Who cares if that causes a 35-man roster? Not me. ...
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Dodgers/Angels report: Mike Piazza was selected to start at
catcher for the seventh consecutive season, and Pedro Martinez is
only skipping the game and the starting nod because the Red Sox are
paranoid about his health. Meanwhile, the two big names that left
the Angels in the offseason were named to the team, St. Louis
outfielder Jim Edmonds and Cleveland pitcher Chuck Finley.
</P>
<P>
   Here's hoping Edmonds gets to bat against Finley and Disney
execs are forced to watch. ...
</P>
<P>
   Cox took only two relievers and only has one shortstop, Barry
Larkin. Torre took four closers. Giambi's election was the first
for an A's player since Mark McGwire and Jose Canseco were elected
in 1992. Royals outfielder Jermaine Dye will be the first Royals
starter since ... George Brett? No, Bo Jackson. ....
</P>
<P>
   Hoop buzz: Grant Hill is leaning toward signing a free agent
deal with Orlando. But Spurs' free agent Tim Duncan hasn't
committed whether that will play a part in his decision to play in
Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   The real hot talk is the status of Tracy McGrady and Eddie
Jones. McGrady is the guy most G.M.s want most, and Jones' name
seems to pop up in every trade rumor. The latest has him being
traded to Chicago, but Miami's interested, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers would like to obtain Miami's P.J. Brown and/or
Portland's Brian Grant. But a Brown-for-Glen Rice deal, or any
other, isn't likely until Hill, Duncan and McGrady have landed.
Boston also wants Indiana's Austin Croshere. ...
</P>
<P>
   Richard Williams is in agony because daughters Venus and Serena
must play each in the Wimbledon semis. Better he should look
forward, because both of his daughters are playing better than
Lindsay Davenport, who plays Jelena Dokic in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   The problems with men's tennis are underscored by the fact Pete
Sampras didn't face a single seeded player enroute to the men's
semifinals, and semifinal opponent Vladimir Voltchkov isn't seeded,
either. Andre Agassi gets the difficult Pat Rafter in the other
men's semifinals. ...
</P>
<P>
   The anti-all-star? Kenny Lofton got the most votes of anyone not
on the team, with 1,126,846. McGriff, Lawton and
man-without-a-position DH Edgar Martinez didn't make the top 10 (or
20) at their positions.
</P>
<P>
   The N.L. player with the fewest votes? Lieberthal with 282,695.
And what does it say that Sheffield had the second-fewest with
292,277? ...

EDITORIAL: POLICE TRAINING AND SEXUAL ASSAULT 
 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, July 6:
</P>
<P>
   New York City's police seem to be making a conscientious effort
to find and punish those officers who did such a poor job of
protecting the women who were attacked by marauding bands of young
men in Central Park last month. This is a healthy development in a
department that tends to blame others when it gets into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The department announced this week that it would discipline nine
police officers, including six supervisors. Although none are
likely to be fired, Police Commissioner Howard Safir seems serious
about punishing officers who failed to aid citizens in trouble. But
there are clearly more systemic problems that need addressing.
Among other things, Safir must reach into the police academy itself
and strengthen that part of the training regimen that deals with
sexual harassment and violence toward women.
</P>
<P>
   Several women charged that police officers whom they approached
to report the assaults did nothing at a time when direct action
might have prevented further attacks. Of the nine officers cited
for misconduct, two were accused of failing to respond properly
when the women told them about sexual assaults. One of these is
accused of refusing to write a report when a victim walked into an
East Side station house to say that she had been assaulted. In
addition, four commanding officers who were at the scene will
receive letters of censure, which become a permanent part of their
personnel files. Three civilian employees will be disciplined for
failing to properly classify 911 calls received regarding the
melee. Safir's procedural recommendations dealt mainly with
tactical issues, urging commanding officers to use helicopters and
different ways of managing crowds.
</P>
<P>
   New techniques are fine, and better preparation for possible
disturbances after the big Puerto Rican National Day parade would
have been useful. But what happened also suggests that the police
may not have been as sensitive to issues of gender relations, as
well as to the special dangers like sexual harassment that women
face, as they are to other issues. Some have also wondered whether
the officers' indifference was reinforced by the fact that most of
the young women were black and Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   These attitudes need to be more effectively dealt with in the
police academy, where new and more intensive training is clearly
needed on issues of gender relations and gender-related violence.

DODGERS BEAT PADRES, PLOT A DIRECTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Los Angeles Dodgers managing general partner and CEO
Bob Daly will be at his Dodger Stadium office in late July, talking
with the team's hierarchy about a trading-deadline move.
</P>
<P>
   The move figures to involve a starting pitcher, but whether one
is coming or going could depend heavily on the next three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   If the path of the Dodgers' 7-5 win against San Diego on
Wednesday at Qualcomm Stadium is any indication, the Dodgers will
be looking to acquire a pitcher to make a playoff push. They
rallied from a five-run deficit thanks to four homers to end a
losing streak at three games, and they still believe the postseason
is possible.
</P>
<P>
   Starter Darren Dreifort and Mark Grudzielanek began the comeback
with home runs in the fifth inning. Todd Hundley tied the game 5-5
with a three-run homer (No. 16) off reliever Carlos Reyes in the
sixth inning, and San Diego-raised Eric Karros broke the tie in the
top of the eighth with a two-run homer off Matt Whiteside.
</P>
<P>
   Karros, who played at Patrick Henry High here, has 24 homers and
69 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers possess that type of comeback ability, but their
play remains inconsistent. A loss would have put the Dodgers
(42-40) at .500 for the first time since April 8, but the recent
poor play hasn't made Daly ready to restructure the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't contemplate making any changes, not as far as
personnel (front office and on-field staff),'' Daly said. ``I'd
like to win some more games. We may make some player moves that
(general manager) Kevin (Malone) is working on, but for every 10
players discussed, you're lucky if you make one.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nobody on the Dodgers, as far as personnel is
concerned, that has to worry about their jobs. We're going to
finish out the year and hopefully do a lot better. I'd like to see
everybody kick a little more butt. That would be nice, to get
everybody fired up a little bit, but not for threatening anybody.
After the All-Star break, everybody gets their juices going, and I
think it would be good to get them going a little faster.''
</P>
<P>
   How the Dodgers decide to attack the last week of the month,
leading up to the July 31 trading deadline, could hinge heavily on
whether the right-handed Dreifort turning things around.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Dreifort is having a miserable time heading into his
free- agent season. He's 1-6 with a 7.03 ERA in his last 10 starts
after beginning the season 3-1 with a 2.59 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two weeks, the Dodgers have been determining the
market value of the 28-year-old, though a deal isn't imminent.
They're also analyzing whether they can compete for the division or
wild-card spot with Dreifort, Eric Gagne and Carlos Perez in their
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will make player changes if the right changes come along,
and they're hard to make because everybody wants the same thing _
pitching,'' Daly said. ``They either want starting pitching or
relief pitching, and very few teams want to pick up money so you
have to creatively figure outa way to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we thought we could bring the right player to the Dodgers
who could help us this season and give us a much better chance to
finish first or in the wild card, would we (add payroll)? The
answer is yes. But we have to find that player, and what are we
giving up in return? We would make a move and add payroll if we had
to.''

BELL'S THREE-RUN SHOT RINGS UP ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Alex Rodriguez is the glitz and glamour of the Seattle
Mariners, and he threw in some pop with two home runs in their 6-4
victory Wednesday night over the Anaheim Angels before 17,369 at
Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's second homer of the night _ off losing pitcher Brian
Cooper (3-3) _ was estimated at 455 feet, but the home run that
made the difference did not come from Rodriguez, who will start at
shortstop next week for the American League in the All-Star game.
</P>
<P>
   David Bell's three-run homer off Cooper in the fifth inning
turned a 3-2 game into 6-2 and propelled the Mariners to their
second win in three games with one to go in the series. Mariners
starter John Halama (8-4) improved to 3-0 lifetime vs. the Angels,
including 2-0 with a 2.31 ERA this season.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper was coming off his first major-league shutout over the
A's, but couldn't make it out of the fifth inning Wednesday. He
went 4 innings and gave up six runs and nine hits.
</P>
<P>
   The victory increased the Mariners' lead in the AL West to
three-and-a -half games over Oakland and seven over the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez hit his first home run in the first inning and might
have received an indirect assist from Rickey Henderson. Henderson
singled to open the game and was on first with one out and
Rodriguez at bat.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper's first pitch to Rodriguez was a pitch-out, but
Henderson, always a threat to steal, stayed put. On a 2-2 pitch,
Rodriguez went the other way, hitting the ball over the fence in
right-center field for a 2-0 Mariners lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels got it back an inning later when Darin Erstad, one of
two Angels All-Stars, ripped a two-out, two-run double down the
right-field line to tie the game at 2. Both runs were unearned
because second baseman Mark McLemore dropped Bengie Molina's popup
earlier in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, however, knocked Cooper out of the game in the
fifth. First, Rodriguez hit a 455-foot home run on Cooper's first
pitch of the inning. Then, after singles by Edgar Martinez and John
Olerud, Bell hit a three-run homer for a 6-2 Mariners lead,
spelling the end of the night for Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Halama found a groove. After allowing a leadoff
single to Vaughn in the third inning, Halama retired the next 10
Angel batters, the streak ending on Garret Anderson's broken-bat
single to center with one out in the sixth.

 INTERPOL TO GET BAY AREA HELP FOILING HACKERS  &HT;     By CARRIE KIRBY 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A Menlo Park, Calif., consulting firm is working
with Interpol, the international police organization, to create a
worldwide network that would act as an early warning system to help
companies protect themselves from cyber attacks.
</P>
<P>
   AtomicTangerine, a 7-month-old commercial spin-off of the
nonprofit SRI International, plans to spend millions of dollars on
the Web-based system, which companies and organizations would use
free of cost, said chief executive Jonathan Fornaci.
</P>
<P>
   Although few details have been worked out, an agreement was
reached when Fornaci visited the organization's headquarters in
Lyon, France, last week. Fornaci said the system would be
operational October 18.
</P>
<P>
   However, in a phone interview with the Associated Press,
Interpol Secretary General Raymond Kendall said that Interpol will
decide by mid-October whether to accept the company's proposal. He
said the agency needed to explore the legal and technical
implications of the project.
</P>
<P>
   If a partnership is reached, it would be the first time the
international police agency has paired with a private company to
fight Internet crime, Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
   Interpol would make available vast amounts of its data on
Internet crimes in its 178 member nations, which include the United
States, and in turn, it would have access to information gathered
by private companies, said Fornaci.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a company gets attacked (by hackers), they would share
that information,'' Fornaci said. Many companies avoid reporting
hacker attacks because they fear damage to their stock value or
their reputation. Using the system, companies would be guaranteed
anonymity and therefore feel free to report details of attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Interpol and AtomicTangerine announced their intention to work
together at an Internet Defense Summit the consultancy co-hosted
last month, which was attended by Interpol representatives as well
as people from Microsoft, AT&AMP;T and other large companies. Via
satellite link from Brussels, Kendall told summit attendees that
``the private sector must defend itself because government agencies
do not have the technology to do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   AtomicTangerine had just invested $20 million in a free
information service called NetRadar, which provides warnings about
potential hacking threats worldwide. For its project with Interpol,
the company plans to create a broader version of NetRadar, along
with an infrastructure that would let worldwide companies report
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall said he is willing to consider AtomicTangerine's offer
because cybercrime is largely uncharted territory for most law
officers _ and governments have found it difficult to coordinate
cross-border efforts to combat this new phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``In police terms, usually when you come across a new type of
crime, the general reaction is to create a special group,'' Kendall
said. ``But there's a limit to how you can transform police
officers or detectives into technicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Interpol has about a half-dozen investigators devoted to
Internet crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my personal opinion that everything that's done in this
area develops very quickly,'' Kendall said in explaining the
reasoning behind a possible partnership with AtomicTangerine. ``So
the response has to be very quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Cybercriminals leave the digital equivalent of fingerprints, but
investigators need to move quickly to uncover them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governments are no longer in a position to be all things to
all people,'' Kendall said. ``The response of the private sector
will be fast because they have an incentive to be fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Justice Department,
lack the staff to investigate and prosecute most cybercrimes _ from
break-ins to data destruction and theft to damaging viruses.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, cybercriminals are breaking into or paralyzing Web
sites with little fear of retribution, costing the private sector
hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   While it may seem strange that Interpol would choose a
little-known startup as a crime-fighting partner, Fornaci said that
the joint project would be built on technology and expertise
created by SRI International, which spun off AtomicTangerine in
January. SRI International, Menlo Park's third-largest employer,
has been around for a half-century and received the first message
ever sent on Arpanet, predecessor to the modern Internet. SRI is
also credited with inventing the computer mouse.
</P>
<P>
   AtomicTangerine already runs a similar information network on a
smaller scale for its International Information Integrity
Institute, a group of about 75 international companies and
government entities that includes the National Security Agency.
Known as I-4, the invitation-only group was started in 1986 by SRI.
</P>
<P>
   Interpol, known formally as the International Criminal Police
Organization, was founded in 1923 to track fugitives and
investigate international crime. Its representative in the United
States is the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

 WINEMAKER WINS RIGHT TO LABELS  &HT;     By PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Wine brands that suggest the contents of a
bottle come from Napa, Calif., when they actually come from
elsewhere may be perfectly legal, according to a key ruling handed
down Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   An administrative law judge for the Treasury Department's Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms dismissed charges by the bureau
that Bronco Wine Co. violated the law by putting ``Rutherford
Vineyards'' and ``Napa Creek'' brand names on wines that did not
necessarily contain grapes from either area.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ruled that Bronco Winery, which is based in Ceres,
Calif., only used labels that were approved by ATF.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a victory for the industry,'' said Fred Franzia,
co-owner and chief financial officer for Bronco Winery. He said
there is an obvious distinction between a brand name or trademark
and a contents label: ``No one assumes Hawaiian Punch is from
Hawaii or London Fog raincoats are from London.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was sharply criticized by many Napa winemakers. ``It
is fundamentally unfair to use a brand name with viticultural
significance on a bottle of wine where the grapes do not come from
that area,'' said Tom Shelton, CEO of Joseph Phelps Vineyards in
St. Helena, Calif., and chairman of the Napa Valley Vintners
Association's Winegrowers Appellation Committee. ``In my mind, it's
consumer fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Wineries cannot make up potentially misleading monikers for
their wines today. To qualify as Napa Valley wine, at least 85
percent of grapes must come from the valley. To qualify as Napa
County wine, the percentage is 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is a loophole for geographic brand names that
existed prior to 1986 before rules were revised to make wine
labeling and advertsing more accurate. As a result, hundreds of
labels with geographic connotations were grandfathered. These
include Bronco's ``Rutherford Vineyards,'' ``Napa Creek,''
``Domaine Napa'' and ``Napa Ridge'' brands.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Bronco paid more than $40 million to Beringer for
its well-known Napa Ridge brand, which for at least 15 years has
produced wine with little or no Napa grape content.
</P>
<P>
   Franzia said the main attraction is the name, not the inventory,
and the price would have made no sense if Bronco were required to
bottle high-priced Napa County Chardonnay or Cabernet instead of
similar varieties from Lodi, Calif., and elsewhere that cost
one-half to one-quarter the price.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the favorable ruling by the administrative law judge,
Bronco's wine labeling battles are not over. The ATF director could
have a different view of the case or the ruling could be appealed
in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The issue also is subject to proposed California legislation.
Last Thursday, Assembly Bill 683, backed by the Napa Valley
Vintners Association, was proposed to require wine bearing a Napa
appellation to contain at least 75 percent Napa-grown grapes.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation ``is designed to correct what we view as an
oversight in BATF regulations and is not a vendetta against Fred
Franzia,'' said the association's Shelton.
</P>
<P>
   Vintners association attorney Richard Mendelson added, ``We
believe the California Legislature has the authority if not the
responsibility to protect consumers from misleading or deceptive
labels.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Governmental Organization Committee voted 8 to 1 for
similar legislation. But dissenter Don Perata (D-Oakland) said
there could be problems as a result of the administrative law
judge's ruling Wednesday and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   He believes federal laws take precedence over California law on
wine labeling, noting that some wineries in other counties view
Napa County vintners' legislative efforts as a push for ``unfair
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All sides agree this is prologue to a protracted `Falcon
Crest'-style court fight,'' Perata said.
</P>
<P>
   Bronco and Franzia are no strangers to court contests. In 1993,
Franzia plead guilty to federal fraud charges over passing off
about 1 million gallons of inexpensive wine as premium zinfandel.
</P>
<P>
   Bronco produces 44 million gallons of wine a year and sells much
of it to other bottlers. Recently, it has been buying brands and is
about to open a huge bottling plant at the Napa County Airport to
increase its Napa Valley capacity.

 MAC Q&AMP;A: UPDATES MAY THAW COLD IMAC  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: My iMac with Mac OS 8.6 often freezes up solid; the only way out
is to turn off the power. I can prevent the problem by
disconnecting both the printer (an HP LaserJet 6L) and the Imation
SuperDisk floppy drive, but of course this rather sharply limits
what I am able to do. When I reconnect either peripheral, I must
accept the likelihood of a hard freeze and loss of data since the
last save, or loss of a Web connection.
</P>
<P>
   Are there patches that might resolve this problem?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: For starters, a simple suggestion: Save your work before you
connect either of those peripherals!
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, there better be a way to resolve your problems _
they sound intolerable. The first step is to make sure you have the
latest software for both the peripherals and the iMac. You can find
the latest drivers and firmware updates for the Imation drive at
 &LR; www.super &LR;   &LR; disk.com/sc/scdl.html &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The LaserJet model you mention was designed for use with Windows
PCs, not Macs. It connects to the computer via a parallel port,
something Macs have never had. If you're really using a LaserJet 6L
with your iMac, it must be via Infowave Software's PowerPrint USB
adapter and software. And lo and behold, a quick trip to Infowave's
download page ( &LR; ftp.infowave.com/pub/UPDATES/powerprint &LR; ) reveals a
file called OS8.6-USBfix, which sounds as if it could be just what
you need.
</P>
<P>
   As for the iMac, Apple has released several updates that might
also be relevant to the problems you're experiencing. Which one you
should install depends on the iMac model and Mac OS version you
have. There's a guide of sorts at
 &LR; til.info.apple.com/techinfo.nsf/artnum/n58174?OpenDocu &LR; 
 &LR; ment&AMP;software &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   If I'm reading it correctly, though, the only thing you might
need to add, because Mac OS 8.6 includes most of the other fixes,
is something called Mac OS ROM Update 1.0, which you can read about
at  &LR; til.info.apple.com/techinfo.nsf/artnum/n60408 &LR;  and download
from  &LR; asu.info.apple.com/swupdates.nsf/artnum/n11476 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   If you happen to be connecting the printer and floppy drive via
a USB hub connected to your iMac, you should also check the hub
vendor's site to see if a software or firmware update is available.
Several early hubs had problems with Apple's implementation of USB.
</P>
<P>
   If the problem persists after you've updated all your software,
let me know and I'll go over some basic troubleshooting techniques
in a future column.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I'm running Mac OS 8.5 on a Power Mac G3 with a 15-inch display.
Is there any way to enlarge an Internet screen even though it may
require scrolling? Too much stuff, too small type and wrong
contrast turn me off on many Internet sites that I would like to
pursue.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: You've got several problems wrapped together there. To fix
``wrong contrast,'' all I can suggest is that you try fiddling with
your brightness and contrast settings, either on the monitor itself
or in the Monitors control panel.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``too much stuff,'' you can always tell your browser not
to display graphics and other non-text items. In Netscape Navigator
or Communicator, go to the Edit menu, choose Preferences, click on
the Advanced category and uncheck ``Automatically load images and
other data types.'' In Internet Explorer, go the Edit menu, choose
Preferences, click on the Web Content category (under Web Browser)
and uncheck pictures and other items you want to eliminate.
</P>
<P>
   If you also want to block banner ads (as well as cookies and
other stuff), try WebFree ($20 shareware from
 &LR; www.falken.net/webfree &LR; ) or WebWasher (free for home and education
use, $29 for business users after 30-day evaluation, from
 &LR; www.webwasher.com &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   Too-small type also has several solutions. If you use Internet
Explorer, go to Preferences again, choose the Language/Fonts
category and increase the point size. In the Netscape browsers, go
to Preferences, then choose Fonts under Appearance and increase the
size for both variable- and fixed-width fonts.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, you can leave the font size as is and instead
switch your monitor to a lower resolution, which will make
everything on screen look bigger. Just open your Monitors control
panel or click on the Monitor Resolution tile in the Control Strip
(the one with the black-and-white checkerboard icon) and choose
lower numbers than what you have now.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; TIP OF THE MONTH
</P>
<P>
   You may have heard about the Hunger Site
( &LR; www.thehungersite.com &LR; ), a Web site where you can, in effect,
donate food to the hungry just by clicking on a button. (The site's
sponsors contribute enough money to pay for a quarter of a cup of
food to the United Nations World Food Programme for every click on
the button, except that only one click per user per day counts.)
Now, several similar sites have sprung up: The Rainforest Site
( &LR; www.therainforestsite.com &LR; ), WebReLeaf ( &LR; www.webreleaf.com &LR; ) and
the multi-cause FreeDonation.com.
</P>
<P>
   The operators of these sites apparently hope to make money for
themselves with these schemes, but their business models also
produce real help for good causes. My only problem is that too
often I forget or never get around to visiting these sites and
making my daily clicks.
</P>
<P>
   Now that problem has a solution _ a free utility called iDonate.
You click once on its Donate button, and it automatically makes a
virtual click at the appropriate spot on any or all of the sites
mentioned above (or so the developers say _ I can't verify exactly
what the program does). Best of all, you can set it to run
automatically every time you start up your Mac.
</P>
<P>
   You can download a copy at
 &LR; www.donation-manager.com/download.html &LR; .

 SMALLER GAME FIRMS SCORE IN COURT AGAINST SONY  &HT;     By KELLY ZITO 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ One might expect two tiny software firms facing
a snarl of million-dollar lawsuits from Japanese electronic titan
Sony to buckle under.
</P>
<P>
   But armed with a spate of recent legal victories and millions in
sales, two California companies that make programs that ``emulate''
Sony's PlayStation on a PC are emerging from the fringes of the
video-game industry and gaining palpable respect in the process.
</P>
<P>
   At last year's Electronic Entertainment Expo, the video-game
world's premier trade show, ``everything was whispered,'' said
David Herpolsheimer, president of Hollywood softwaremaker Bleem
Inc. Video-game developers ``would come up to us and say, `This is
really cool.' But they didn't say it too loud because they (were)
afraid of Sony. This year (at E3), it was incredible to see how
things changed. We were welcomed and accepted and these companies
were seeing that we're not pirates or hackers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bleem's eponymous product and the Virtual Game Station, from San
Mateo's Connectix Corp., let consumers play select PlayStation
titles such as Grand Turismo on their PCs at one-third to one-half
the price of the PlayStation console (Connectix also makes a
version for Macs).
</P>
<P>
   Video-gamers have welcomed the products with open arms,
according to the companies. Since its launch last year, Bleem has
sold about 300,000 units. Connectix would not disclose an exact
sales figure but said its Virtual GameStation has sold between
66,000 and 110,000 units.
</P>
<P>
   Sony, worried that its intellectual property may be on the line,
has filed a slew of lawsuits against the firms. But so far, the
courts have sided with the Davids, not Goliath.
</P>
<P>
   In May, a judge in U.S. District Court in San Francisco tossed
out seven of the nine counts in a copyright suit Sony filed against
Connectix in January 1999. In that suit and in others, Sony claims
emulators cheapen its brand and infringe on its copyrights because
the software is ``reverse engineered'' _ created by taking apart
Sony's hardware and examining how it functions.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are still wrangling over the remaining trade
secret and unfair competition claims. Last Thursday, Sony dropped a
separate patent suit against Connectix, filed in February, but then
refiled six of the 11 claims the next day to avoid ``procedural
issues that may have been appealable.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the flip-flop, Pamela Samuelson, a law professor at the
University of California at Berkeley, says there is marked momentum
in favor of Connectix _ and by extension, Bleem. Much of it stems
from the early 1990s, when many of the so-called ``interoperability
wars'' were originally fought.
</P>
<P>
   ``The courts over the years have said that if all you're trying
to do is allow people to play games they already own on their own
machines, that's good for consumers and that's good for
competition,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sony, known for fiercely guarding its technology, doesn't see it
that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to assert that we have a legal obligation to
protect our intellectual property,'' said Sony spokeswoman Molly
Smith, ``and we're going to continue to move forward with this type
of litigation to make sure we're doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   The company did not respond to repeated requests for a more
in-depth interview about the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The reason the company has filed so many, however, ties directly
into the ubiquity of its signature gaming machine.
</P>
<P>
   It's estimated that 1 in 5 U.S. households has a PlayStation.
And with hundreds of titles on the market for the machine, Sony has
become a ripe target for the emulator companies.
</P>
<P>
   While most of Sony's games start off tied to the PlayStation
console, many end up on computer desktops because developers make
versions playable on PCs. Regardless of the eventual format, Sony
wants the PlayStation disks to run only on the PlayStation console.
</P>
<P>
   Sony and some outside developers say that stance benefits
consumers because the games are built for the console, which means
seamless function and better customer support.
</P>
<P>
   But others say that strategy, and the lawsuits, are Sony's
attempts to dominate video gaming as the company positions its
PlayStation 2 _ due out this fall _ as the Internet and
entertainment hub for the home.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Funk, editor of Electronic Gaming Monthly, notes Sony is
trying to block emulators and simultaneously expand the reach of
the PlayStation hardware. Earlier this month, the company said it
would license the PlayStation 2 ``chip sets'' to third-party
hardwaremakers.
</P>
<P>
   If the initiative goes as planned, PlayStation games could
surface on TV set-top boxes, Internet appliances or wireless
devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to broaden the accessibility of their platform, but
only on their terms,'' Funk said. ``The emulators simply take the
ball out of their court.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuelson is even more blunt. ``Sony is essentially trying to
create a monopoly position for themselves,'' the law professor
said.
</P>
<P>
   Others say Sony has cause for its rash of legal filings.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bleem and Connectix say their products require an original
PlayStation title for play on the PC. But Silicon Valley
intellectual property attorney Rich Gray says copying a PlayStation
CD is a relatively easy endeavor once it's loaded onto a PC. The
next step is a rash of counterfeit games that threaten the
company's software sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Sony, (the lawsuits) are not so much about making a lot of
money as it is keeping the games tied to a platform where it's
difficult to make and use illegal copies of the games _ which are
the real cash cows,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, ``Sony has the right to enforce their copyright,''
Gray said. ``If that means they're preventing someone from playing
it on another platform, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Herpolsheimer and Connectix chief executive Roy McDonald
deny the piracy charge and say their products actually stimulate
Sony sales. The theory goes that if someone has a PC, likes
PlayStation games, but doesn't want to buy the console, they'll buy
an emulator (Connectix's Virtual Game Station sells for $50; Bleem
is priced at $30; PlayStation sells for $99) and some Sony titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our product contributes to Sony's profitability,'' McDonald
said. ``It's generally understood in the gaming industry that
virtually all the profit is in the software, not the platform
itself. Our product creates new consoles for Sony.''
</P>
<P>
   Sony might dispute that. But one thing is for sure: Emulators
threaten the fees Sony garners from outside game developers _ one
of the most lucrative sources of revenue for the company, which
enjoys $63 billion in worldwide sales a year. About 11 percent of
that figure comes from PlayStation-related hardware, software and
licensing.
</P>
<P>
   It's estimated that companies like Redwood City's Electronic
Arts Inc. pay a $10-per-game licensing fee to Sony. For that, their
games are played on a console that has sold more than 25 million
units in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   If more consumers buy emulators, developers might switch
allegiance to Microsoft _ which doesn't charge licensing fees for
PC games and is trying to recruit developers for its X-box console,
due out next year.
</P>
<P>
   There is also an issue of quality.
</P>
<P>
   Not all emulated games look the way they do on the PlayStation.
Both Bleem and Connectix have a list of recommended titles that
have been tested with the emulator. While the recommended
PlayStation games look similar to, and in some cases better than,
those played on the console, those not recommended can look blocky
and have glitches in the sound effects. And customer support, for
Bleem anyway, is funneled mainly through its Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Though some expect Bleem and Connectix to prevail in their legal
skirmishes with Sony, the prospects for Bleem and Connectix in the
video-game arena are clouded. Though Virtual Game Station isn't
Connectix's main focus (the company also makes PC emulators for
Macs), a Sony restraining order tied it up in legal limbo for a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Herpolsheimer says the lawsuits cost Bleem its profits last year
_ about $1.5 million _ and ``poison pilled'' the company with
video-game developers in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most video-game developers are cagey when the topic of
emulators comes up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ain't got a dog in that fight; that's a hardware battle,''
said Jeff Brown, spokesman for Electronic Arts.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, editor Funk says emulators aren't likely to top
any software best-seller list.
</P>
<P>
   But he says emulation technology is another step toward a gaming
world where the game itself, not the device, takes center stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There comes a point where you turn the hardware into the
equivalent of a telephone and what matters is the content on the
other end of the line,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Until that happens, the legal death match will continue. At E3,
Bleem unveiled an emulator that will let gamers play PlayStation
titles on the Dreamcast console from Sega _ Sony's archrival. The
Bleem product for Dreamcast is due out later this month. Nintendo,
the gaming giant behind the Pokemon phenomenon, has avoided the
fray by sticking to a cartridge format for its N64 console.
Cartridges are generally trickier to emulate or copy.
</P>
<P>
   Sega has remained mum on the topic. And though Sony will not
comment on whether it will take legal action, many video-game
insiders expect it.
</P>
<P>
   For Herpolsheimer, who thinks one of these emulator cases will
eventually end up in the U.S. Supreme Court, even the rumor of
another Sony lawsuit is reason enough to continue pumping out
Bleem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd probably be done with PlayStation if Sony didn't keep
suing us and costing us money,'' Herpolsheimer said. ``It's almost
like we have to keep selling it.''

 CHANGES IN MEXICO MAY HURT U.S. FIRMS  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ President-elect Vicente Fox's pledge to improve
the livelihood of workers in Mexico played well with voters, but
the promise could have a serious impact on the many U.S. companies
with manufacturing facilities south of the border.
</P>
<P>
   If Fox succeeds in boosting Mexican workers' wages, U.S.
manufacturers, including a number of Silicon Valley technology
enterprises, may be forced to look elsewhere for the cheap labor
that helps keep their products competitive on store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Over the long run, though, higher pay for Mexican workers may
end up expanding the market for U.S. goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that changes the economic status quo would be a
challenge,'' said Ruben Barrales, chief executive of San Jose,
Calif.'s Joint Venture: Silicon Valley Network, a coalition of
local companies and governments. ``It may mean that for really
cheap labor, companies will have to go to other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive, has said he will strive to
ensure that incomes rise higher than the rate of inflation _ now
running about 10 percent _ during his first year in office.
</P>
<P>
   However, this may be easier said than done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still Mexico,'' said John Schick, director general of the
Mexico Consulting Group, a San Francisco firm that advises U.S.
companies on investing in the country. ``Things are not really
going to change for another generation.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he predicted that Fox will offer a variety of
incentives to woo U.S. high-tech firms, and that Mexico may
eventually prove to be a more-attractive overseas outpost for
Silicon Valley than low-overhead rivals like China and India.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things change fast in the Valley, and Mexico allows people to
just hop on a plane and get down there,'' Schick said. ``Compared
to China or India, it is so much easier to do business.''
</P>
<P>
   Exports accounted for nearly a third of Mexico's gross domestic
product last year, up from 13 percent in 1993, before the North
American Free Trade Agreement with the United States and Canada was
implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican government officials say that about half the 3.3 million
jobs created since 1995 are export-related and that such jobs
usually pay better.
</P>
<P>
   The tech boom in the United States has not been lost on
growth-hungry Mexico's economic planners, and there has been a
concerted effort in recent years to attract more technology
enterprises to the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very aggressive about it,'' said Douglas Smurr,
director of the California Office of Trade and Investment in Mexico
City. ``And people have been very impressed with the amount of
skilled labor in Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of these skilled workers _ young, well-educated people in
their 20s and 30s _ are now flocking to Guadalajara, where what
some call a ``Little Silicon Valley'' has taken root as an
increasing number of tech companies open plants in the area.
</P>
<P>
   In just one example of Guadalajara's attractiveness to U.S. tech
manufacturers, Milpitas, Calif., electronics-maker Solectron Corp.
said recently that it may hand pink slips to as many as 850 of the
1,500 workers at its Georgia plant as it expands operations in the
Mexican city.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which produces cellular phones as a subcontractor
for other manufacturers, cited cheaper labor as being its chief
reason for the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a difficult decision driven by changing market
conditions,'' Fred Forsyth, president of Solectron Americas, said
in a statement. ``Simply put, most of our competitors and customers
have already moved cell phone manufacturing to lower labor-cost
geographies, and we must take this action to remain competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Higher wages in Mexico would undercut this advantage. But Andrew
Rose, a professor of international trade at the University of
California at Berkeley's Haas School of Business, said it would
ultimately be a plus for the United States if Fox prevailed in
raising Mexican wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Higher wages mean higher demand for our products,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, he dismissed the suggestion that Mexico can compete
with the likes of China and India for the lion's share of excess
tech production from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's economy, Rose said, is simply too well-developed to
allow creation of the sort of tech sweatshops that have popped up
in China and India.
</P>
<P>
   He and other observers agreed that the most likely scenario is
that Mexico will continue the economic reforms begun under previous
presidential administrations, and that Fox will probably succeed in
attracting more foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man is a businessman,'' said the Mexico Consulting Group's
Schick. ``He thinks as an entrepreneur. This is bound to be good.''

 VISA USA MOVING HEADQUARTERS TO SAN FRANCISCO  &HT;     By KELLY YAMANOUCHI 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Visa USA announced plans Wednesday to shift its
headquarters to downtown San Francisco from Foster City, Calif., in
a move designed to bring it closer to member banks and ease
commuting problems for its employees.
</P>
<P>
   The new office, which will take up four floors at 123 Mission
St., will house 200 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The first contingent of employees is expected to move into the
new headquarters in November with a second and final group
scheduled for April.
</P>
<P>
   The giant financial services company said it is making the move
in anticipation of rapid growth and worsening traffic conditions
around the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the chief executive officer and executive management,
six other departments will make the move: advertising and brand
management, consumer products, corporate relations, emerging
technologies, e-Visa and smart cards.
</P>
<P>
   Some Visa USA and Visa International employees will continue to
work at 900 Metro Center Blvd. in Foster City.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is leasing the new office space for seven
years through real estate agency Michael Lydon &AMP; Co., says that the
addition of the San Francisco location may lead to a regional
network of work sites from which employees can choose.
</P>
<P>
   Visa USA, which also has offices in San Mateo and Hayward,
employs about 710 in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a presence in San Francisco really helps us,'' said
Susan Forman, a vice president at Visa USA and head of the
transition efforts. ``We're really behind in this move. It will
make us a better employer in this area.''
</P>
<P>
   With Caltrain, Muni, Muni Metro and BART transit locations
nearby, Visa USA hopes that the office will be more convenient to
employees who are fed up with rush-hour traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't improve the commute for everyone, but it will improve
for some,'' Forman said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the San Francisco move, the company is
considering options to ease the commute for employees _ including
carpools and vanpools, telecommuting, alternative work schedules,
and a satellite office outside San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really doing this because we want to retain and attract
talent to Visa,'' Forman said. ``With the current pressures of the
new economy, with the commute becoming worse and worse in this
area, we feel that we need to become a more flexible employer.''
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Hauptman, spokeswoman for the San Francisco Chamber of
Commerce, said Visa's move makes sense. ``San Francisco is the
leading financial center on the West Coast,'' she said. ``The
public transportation systems are getting better and better all the
time. Muni is showing vast improvement.''

MEDIA BYTES: HEAR THE ONE ABOUT THE COMEDY WEB SITE THAT MADE
A  PROFIT?
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAN FOST 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ How many comedy sites does it take to make money
on the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   Ummm ...
</P>
<P>
   Why did the comedy site try to turn a profit when it knew Net
content was a hopeless business?
</P>
<P>
   Come on, these are the jokes, folks _ and while they may not get
me a job with Jay Leno, they're at least as funny as some of what's
passing for humor online these days.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't really laugh too much while I surfed around
 &LR; www.comedyworld.com &LR; , the site started by San Francisco's Comedy
World. The company announced last week that Sandra Bernhard and the
Canadian comedy troupe Kids in the Hall will participate in the
site, so maybe things will get funnier.
</P>
<P>
   But the business plan has raised some serious money _ $10
million from the venture capital firm Attractor and private
investors, including ZDNet chief executive officer Dan Rosensweig
and Cnet CEO Shelby Bonnie.
</P>
<P>
   That business plan, like many of the new content plays, involves
distributing the content over not only the Internet, but also
television, radio and even wireless devices like cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not really building a Web site,'' Comedy World CEO Jody
Sherman said. ``We're building a media network.''
</P>
<P>
   But he does acknowledge that the Web stands at the core of the
operation. And that makes sense: Comedy World hopes to use the low
cost of Web distribution to create a cult hit online. If it can do
that, it could then sell that hit to television at much more
favorable terms than if it started shopping untried concepts to
entertainment execs.
</P>
<P>
   It's an interesting idea, but it may have trouble working.
``It's a way to blow a lot of money on a Web site, or not much
money on a production company,'' said Malcolm Maclachlan, a media
and e-commerce analyst for IDC. ``Web economics are not working out
too well in the entertainment space, so they're looking at the Web
as a tool, rather than their main means of distribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Other sites are making it work on a smaller scale. For instance,
the Onion ( &LR; www.theonion.com &LR; ) _ a truly funny satire of newspapers
_ has ads on its site, and also has off-line counterparts, like a
print edition and a book. A relatively new site, Modern Humorist _
at  &LR; www.modernhumorist.com  &LR; _ also has plans to branch into other
media.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to create a brand, more than create hits,'' said
Michael Colton, Modern Humorist's co-editor and co-founder and a
former reporter for Brill's Content and the Washington Post. The
company is seeking book deals, putting pieces online and on the
radio, and writing funny pieces for hire that run in magazines and
other Web sites (such as a parody that Fortune magazine ran called
``MisFortune'').
</P>
<P>
   His model is the old National Lampoon, which used a print
magazine to launch radio, stage and screen ventures in the 1970s.
He hopes to build a similar stable of talented humor writers, using
the Web as a base.
</P>
<P>
   Colton said Modern Humorist has venture backing in the ``low
seven figures.'' He was on the road covering the presidential
primaries for Brill's when his partner had the meeting with Carlin
Ventures; Colton listened in ``from a cell phone in the bathroom of
John McCain's campaign bus. I could barely hear as I rocked back
and forth on the Straight Talk Express.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the more popular sites for humor is at
 &LR; www.comedycentral.com &LR; , the Web home of the cable channel Comedy
Central. But that's a different proposition, using the Web to
promote a broadcast property by, for example, allowing users to
download previews of ``South Park'' bits.
</P>
<P>
   The Humor Network operates online only, but it takes advantage
of the Internet's biggest killer app: &QL; 
e-mail. With its flagship site at  &LR; www.joke-of-the-day.com &LR; , the
New York company sends out a joke to more than 1 million people
every day. The way I figure, the Internet became popular in no
small part because of people e-mailing each other jokes (usually
dumb ones, but that didn't stop many of my friends).
</P>
<P>
   Comedy World has about 45 people working in its Financial
District office, primarily in Web development, marketing and
business development, and it has a studio in Los Angeles where it
creates and produces the content. And it's a lot of content: 18
hours a day of live programming, much of it featuring comics like
Bobby Slayton, Sue Murphy and CEO Sherman's favorite, the duo of
Travis Clark and Greg Behrendt, who host ``The Manversation'' every
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   It also has a variety of other jokes and gags, many sorted by
topic. And how's this for a Web advantage: You can search for a
word, like ``lightbulb,'' and find 16 relevant jokes.
</P>
<P>
   So to share Comedy World's sparkling wit, and leave you
laughing, here's a short sample: Why did the spider cross the road?
</P>
<P>
   To get to another Web site.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest you do the same.
</P>
<P>
   HAIL TO ``THE CHIEF'': Because I'll someday be working for the
Hearst Corp. _ assuming, of course, that Hearst's deal to buy The
Chronicle goes through, maybe even during my lifetime _ I found it
worthwhile last week to meet with David Nasaw, author of ``The
Chief,`` an acclaimed new biography of William Randolph Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to know: Did Hearst ``horse-trade'' his editorial pages
for business or political favors, as the publisher of the San
Francisco Examiner, his once-flagship newspaper, is now accused of
doing? Nasaw's answer: Not exactly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chief was above that,'' Nasaw said. ``He didn't do favors.
He expected politicians to do favors for him. He wouldn't have sold
his editorials to anybody. They were his pages. He would not have
engaged in this kind of horse-trading.''
</P>
<P>
   I was also interested in Nasaw's analysis of Hearst as the
builder of the first true media powerhouse, the forerunner of
today's megamedia operations. In his heyday, Hearst boasted 20
million readers for his newspapers, magazines, news services, radio
shows and newsreels _ 1 out of every 5 Americans. By comparison, a
combined 7 million people watch network anchors Dan Rather, Peter
Jennings and Tom Brokaw each night _ and the population has doubled
since Hearst's day.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hearst's attempt to use that media power to foster his own
ambitions and promote his own opinions changed the shape of the
media forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't interested in objectivity. He was interested in
advocacy journalism,'' Nasaw said. ``If you didn't like it, you
could read another newspaper. ... He wrote and signed his own
editorials, and put them on the front page.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearst took many unpopular views. ``He was against American
involvement in World War I, and he was against the New Deal,''
Nasaw said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the negative poster boy for advocacy journalism,'' Nasaw
said. ``It's totally gone because of him. You don't see (Rupert)
Murdoch writing editorials. You know there's strong opinions there.
You know Ted Turner has strong opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   But the modern moguls keep their views out of their
publications, Nasaw said: ``They all learned from Hearst.''

NO DEALS ON TABLE, SAYS DALY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The Los Angeles Dodgers have a $90 million payroll,
are two games above .500 and certainly are not playing up to
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But Dodgers managing general partner and CEO Bob Daly is a
patient man who doesn't make changes without putting loads of
thought into it.
</P>
<P>
   So before the Dodgers rallied to score the final seven runs in a
7-5 win at San Diego on Wednesday to end a losing streak at three
games, Daly spoke about the club's plans for the second half of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   And he said the only changes coming during the season would be
in player personnel and not in the front office or with the
on-field staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't contemplate making any changes, not as far as
personnel (front-office and on-field staff),'' Daly said. ``I'd
like to win some more games. We may make some player moves that
(general manager) Kevin (Malone) is working on, but for every 10
players discussed, you're lucky if you make one.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nobody on the Dodgers, as far as personnel is
concerned, that has to worry about their jobs. We're going to
finish out the year and hopefully do a lot better. I'd like to see
everybody kick a little more butt. That would be nice, to get
everybody fired up a little bit, but not for threatening anybody.
After the All-Star break, everybody gets their juices going and I
think it would be good to get them going a little faster.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' win against the Padres could be the spark that
ignites a nice run to the break, especially with all-star
right-hander Kevin Brown closing out the series today.
</P>
<P>
   Starter Darren Dreifort and Mark Grudzielanek began the comeback
from a 5-0 deficit with solo homers in the fifth inning and
switch-hitting catcher Todd Hundley, who's started three of the
five games on the road trip, tied it 5-5 with a three-run homer
(No. 16) off reliever Carlos Reyesin the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego-reared Eric Karros broke the tie in the top of the
eighth with a two-run homer off Matt Whiteside. Karros, who played
at Patrick Henry High, has 24 homers and 69 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big hit was Hundley, tying the ballgame and giving us an
opportunity to win,'' Karros said. ``He's got to be in the lineup
every day. That's the bottom line. What he provides for this
offense, and that's not to take anything away from Chad (Kreuter),
but Hundley can turn the game around with one swing. He can do it
any at-bat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers (42-40) possess that type of comeback ability, but
their play remains inconsistent. They avoided falling to .500 for
the first time since April 8. Even so, the Dodgers are six games
behind Arizona and in fourth place, and team officials plan to add
a starting pitcher at the trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will make player changes if the right changes come along,
and they're hard to make because everybody wants the same thing _
pitching,'' Daly said. ``They either want starting pitching or
relief pitching, and very few teams want to pick up money so you
have to creatively figure out a way to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we thought we could bring the right player to the Dodgers
who could help us this season and give us a much better chance to
finish first or in the wild card, would we (add payroll)? The
answer is yes. But we have to find that player, and what are we
giving up in return? We would make a move and add payroll if we had
to.''

SONICS GO INTO FULL-COURT PRESS TO RETAIN LEWIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It is good to be able to concentrate on the topic of
Rashard Lewis' future.
</P>
<P>
   At 20 years old, Lewis is the best example of what can happen to
a talented high school basketball player when he is drafted by an
NBA team.
</P>
<P>
   If the league is in trouble because Michael Jordan is playing
golf and the incoming rookies have little or no college experience,
watching a player like Lewis flower isn't a bad alternative.
</P>
<P>
   The fresh legs. The willingness to put your head down and learn.
</P>
<P>
   The games when suddenly _ even in playoff contests featuring
Karl Malone, John Stockton and Gary Payton _ Lewis' bounce and
promise are the most impressive things to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just shows you what a lot of hard work can get you,''
Lewis said Wednesday at the Sonics training facility. ``Not being
drafted right away, being drafted in the second round, people
saying you weren't going to make it, a lot of the negative things _
it just shows you how much hard work can help you. Being a nice guy
and being yourself helps in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got the game to play in the NBA, if you've got the
heart and the work ethic, you can make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years into his pro career, Lewis emerged last season as
something just short of the Sonics' saving grace.
</P>
<P>
   In a sketchy second half of the season, just around the time
when nearly every other Sonics player was in a huff, confused,
depressed, playing poorly, not talking or throwing VCR remote
controls, Lewis soared.
</P>
<P>
   We are not talking about ignorance is bliss.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is a sharp guy. He's also nice, hard-working and, as much
as he might hate the reputation, sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   His quiet resolve has helped him grow and improve at a rate that
critics of the NBA's youth movement never dare predict.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I played at the end of the season, a lot's going to be
expected of me this season, so that's the reason I'm working out. I
feel like I could have done better,'' Lewis said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is working out with the Sonics' L.A. summer league squad.
Everyone hopes that Lewis' willingness to play this summer is an
indication that the coveted free agent will re-sign with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis places great importance on the chance to play, to be a
starter, to be a star.
</P>
<P>
   His primary consideration will be ``where would I be playing the
most, where would I be starting. It won't be totally financial. No,
I wouldn't say that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics are desperate to re-sign Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   A host of NBA teams, depending on which way the free-agent
dominoes fall, will call with offers _ some, no doubt, offering
more than the Sonics' initial $3.9 million bid.
</P>
<P>
   If Tracy McGrady leaves Toronto, the Raptors might come up with
as much as $5.5 or $6 million. Now that Detroit appears about to
lose Grant Hill, the Pistons might ante up. Same with the Bulls.
Maybe even the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the teams with salary cap room will call, and probably
everyone else who doesn't have cap room, too,'' Sonics president
Wally Walker said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone understands what Lewis has done for himself since being
drafted by the Sonics with the 32nd overall pick in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's paid his dues, and now all the people who missed the boat
want to jump on the bandwagon,'' Sonics assistant coach Dwane Casey
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has proved everyone wrong. He has worked hard. He's gone
from being a second-round pick to being the kind of guy people talk
about as a franchise player.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of a full-court press to make sure Lewis understands how
much he is wanted in Seattle, Sonics owner Barry Ackerley took
Lewis out for a private talk the other day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only other player Mr. Ackerley has ever done that for is
Gary Payton, so I think Rashard understood how important he is to
the entire organization. He is the top priority,'' Casey said.
</P>
<P>
   Payton, although he has not called Lewis like he said he was
going to, has been a strong advocate. Payton has said Lewis is a
main option on the team, a 6-foot-10 small forward who should be
scoring 20 points and getting marquee billing in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone worried that the All-Star point guard's volatile
nature has negatively impacted the soft-spoken Lewis, Lewis has
grown up enough to be able to handle Payton.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just Gary being Gary,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hearing him say I can score 20 and play 30-plus minutes does
make a difference. He is our leader. He's the captain of this team.
We are going to follow him. He's going to be the one who leads us
to wherever he's going to lead us to,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes Gary a while to respect a lot of young guys. Toward
the end of the year, he gained a lot of respect for me, and that
was a good feeling, and very important for me. That helped me play
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis also has a great rapport with Casey and Nate McMillan, two
teachers who have helped Lewis accelerate his NBA learning process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nate and Dwane are the big part of this team. Without them,
I'm not sure what would have happened. They're great assistant
coaches. They're here for you and help you in any way you need.
They're always addressing things,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics have identified Lewis as an emerging star with a
limitless future.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, they might be able to convince Lewis that they can
do as much for him as he can for them.

RODRIGUEZ HOMERS TWICE TO POWER MARINERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ There's nothing like being picked the creme de
la creme.
</P>
<P>
   Or so it seems for Alex Rodriguez, whose bat had looked just a
little sluggish.
</P>
<P>
   That was before Tuesday, when he was named the starting
shortstop for the American League All-Star team. Once again
recognized as the best of the best, Rodriguez has celebrated with
typical Rodriguez fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   He had two homers Wednesday night to help carry the Mariners to
a 6-4 victory over the Anaheim Angels at Edison Field. The night
before, he homered in his first at-bat and added a sacrifice fly
later in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been feeling pretty good about what I'd been doing for a
week or two now,'' Rodriguez said after homers Nos. 23 and 24.
``The last couple of days, though, it all came together.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night he homered with a man on in the first, then hit
a solo shot in the fifth that was the trigger for a four-run
inning, the bigger blast being a three-run bomb by David Bell.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the solo homer to left that had the Mariners talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``That might be the longest ball I've seen hit all year,''
manager Lou Piniella said. ``That was huge. But what we've seen the
last two nights is why Alex is an All-Star. He's a good player, and
tonight was a great example of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Together, Rodriguez and Bell got starter John Halama (8-4) out
to a 6-2 lead. And the long ball helped the Mariners add another
game to their lead in the AL West. With Oakland losing in Texas,
Seattle has a 3{-game lead over the A's, the Mariners' biggest lead
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't only the long ball that proved the salve for the
wound left by the late loss to the Angels on Tuesday. The Mariners
got a nice game from Halama, who allowed just two earned runs, and
terrific relief work from Brett Tomko (21/3 innings) and Kazuhiro
Sasaki, who put the Angels away with a big ninth inning, cutting
through the heart of the Angels offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the two relievers did was huge,'' pitching coach Bryan
Price said. ``Tomko came in with the bases loaded (in the sixth
inning) and went right after the hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomko induced a popup from Benji Gil, and that was the last best
chance for the Angels to strike. Anaheim got almost nothing against
Tomko in the seventh and eighth, and Sasaki retired Scott Spiezio,
Mo Vaughn and Tim Salmon, each as the potential tying run, in the
ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bullpen has been our backbone here all year,'' Rodriguez
said. ``You can't say enough about what they've done for us.
They're a big reason why we're where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Sasaki did walk the first man he faced, Darin Erstad.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you need to know about Kaz you can get by watching his
mound demeanor,'' Price said. ``He's comfortable in what he does,
and he's doing it extremely well.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, so is Halama. Wednesday night was one of those times.
He might have been pitching to stay in the rotation. If so, he did
a creditable job. The two runs he allowed in the second inning were
unearned, thanks to a dropped pop fly by Mark McLemore. Halama
wasn't threatened again until the sixth, when all manner of hits
cheap and freakish showed up to chase him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pitched the game I had to pitch; I threw strikes, made them
swing,'' Halama said. ``In the sixth, they had to swing, and some
of the balls they hit just found the holes. There's nothing I can
do about that.''
</P>
<P>
   With Seattle holding a 6-2 lead entering the bottom of the
sixth, bad luck caught up with Halama. Garret Anderson singled, and
from that point on, the Mariners' lead began to burn off faster
than sunscreen on a 90-degree Southern California day. Benjie
Molina singled to left with two outs. Then Adam Kennedy beat out a
single to shortstop, loading the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Edgard Clemente singled to right, bringing home one run. And
Erstad chopped a grounder that hung in the air like a balloon left
over from the Fourth of July, refusing to come down until another
run had scored and Erstad was safely at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only walked one man all night,'' Halama said. ``I'm happy
with the job I did. Some of those infield hits and choppers no one
can do anything about.''
</P>
<P>
   Price went a step further, saying ``with any kind of luck at
all, that might have been the best inning John pitched the entire
game. But the bounces don't always go your way.''
</P>
<P>
   With the bases loaded and the game on the line, Tomko took over.
He got Gil to pop out _ to McLemore, who squeezed this one good.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth inning, Sasaki struck out Vaughn on a high
fastball, then got Salmon to pop out to McLemore.
</P>
<P>
   The M's are a season-best 16 games over .500 (49-33) and the
winners of four of their past five, 12 of 15 and 22 of 30.

RODRIGUEZ, BELL RING UP ANGELS
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Alex Rodriguez is the glitz and glamour of the
Seattle Mariners, and he threw in some pop with two home runs in
their 6-4 victory over the Anaheim Angels on Wednesday night in
front of 17,369 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's second homer of the night _ off losing pitcher Brian
Cooper (3-3) _ was estimated at 455 feet, but the home run that
made the difference did not come from Rodriguez, who will start at
shortstop next week for the American League in the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   David Bell's three-run homer off Cooper in the fifth inning
turned a 3-2 game into 6-2 and propelled the Mariners to their
second win in three games with one to go in the series. Mariners
starter John Halama (8-4) improved to 3-0 lifetime vs. the Angels,
including 2-0 with a 2.31 ERA this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``A-Rod (Rodriguez) is a good hitter and he's going to hit
pitches,'' Cooper said. ``I looked at the tape and the first homer
was a good pitch. The next homer was a first-pitch fastball....
I'll give up a solo homer. But I hung a change-up to Bell and that
really killed me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the first home run he's hit in his life,'' Angels
manager Mike Scioscia said of Bell, who has six homers this season
compared to 24 by Rodriguez. ``It's not like saying the sky fell
because he hit a homer. (Cooper) made a mistake and when you make a
mistake it can hurt you.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper was coming off his first major-league shutout in a win
over the A's but couldn't make it out of the fifth inning
Wednesday. He went 4 innings and gave up six runs and nine hits,
but after the game he said he felt as good as he has all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference was when I made good pitches, they fouled them
off, and when I made a mistake, they didn't miss many,'' Cooper
said. ``I wasn't concerned about the three runs because I know we
can score and the bullpen's solid. I thought I could get into the
sixth or seventh giving up three or four runs. But then Bell hits
the home run ... you can't give up three-run bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory increased the Mariners lead in the AL West to
three-and-a-half games over Oakland and seven over the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez hit his first home run in the first inning with Rickey
Henderson on first for a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels got it back one inning later when Darin Erstad, one
of two Angels All-Stars, ripped a two-out, two-run double down the
right-field line to tie the game 2-2. Both runs were unearned
because second baseman Mark McLemore dropped Bengie Molina's popup
earlier in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper escaped trouble in both the second and fourth innings
despite a couple of errors _ one physical and one mental _ by
second baseman Adam Kennedy. In the second inning, the Mariners'
Mike Cameron hit a grounder to third baseman Troy Glaus that might
have started an inning-ending force play at second. Glaus' throw
was slightly to Kennedy's right, and Kennedy dropped the ball for
an error. However, Cooper was able to escape by striking out
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, with Bell on first base, Robert Machado bunted to
Glaus, who fielded the ball cleanly with his bare hand. But he
didn't throw to first because Kennedy was late getting to the base.
First baseman Mo Vaughn had come toward the plate when Machado
squared to bunt.
</P>
<P>
   But Cooper got out of that jam, too. He made a diving stop on a
grounder by McLemore, then threw out McLemore at first for the
first out. With the runners now on second and third, Henderson his
a sharp one-hopper to Benji Gil at shortstop. The runners had to
freeze and Gil threw out Henderson for the second out.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper got out of the inning when Cameron flied to center.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, however, knocked Cooper out of the game with four
runs in the fifth, all four coming on the home runs by Rodriguez
and Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``His command was good, he just lost it for a time,'' Scioscia
said of Cooper. ``He's gone through stretches where he gets out of
whack, but he's been able to make adjustments and get out of it.
Unfortunately tonight he couldn't make adjustments before they had
six runs on the board.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels got a pair of RBI singles by Edgard Clemente and
Erstad in the sixth, but Brett Tomko (2 scoreless innings) and
Kazuhiro Sasaki (scoreless ninth, 18th save) closed it out.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Hero of Mexican election was Ernesto Zedillo
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The big winner in the Mexican election was Mexico itself, but
the hero of the election was not the successful presidential
candidate, Vicente Fox. It was the outgoing president, Ernesto
Zedillo, whose party's nominee got walloped.
</P>
<P>
   Candidate by default six years ago when the anointed nominee of
the Institutional Revolutionary Party _ PRI in its Spanish language
acronym _ was assassinated, straight-arrow Zedillo stuck to reforms
already tentatively under way and added more, in the end securing
the means and atmosphere that could lead to a peaceful transition
of power.
</P>
<P>
   Could, and did.
</P>
<P>
   Thus ends 71 years of sham democracy, in which PRI come to
perpetuate itself in power through bribery, fraud and simple
muscle, all behind a gloss of democratic forms. In recent years,
that patina has looked more like the sheen of flop sweat.
</P>
<P>
   PRI has long been far more institutional than revolutionary. The
no-succession constitution, in practice, failed to prevent the
entrenchment of power represented by the previous, open-ended reign
of Porfirio Diaz. The party's inner circle hand-picked presidents
who differed in appearance but not in purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Among the results: a stymied economy shuddered by periodic
crises, police and court systems funded under the table and endemic
patronage corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Fox and his National Action Party face formidable challenges in
untangling economic, social and political systems in which PRI and
the state have become so intertwined that often only the subtle can
tell where one ends and the other begins.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, voters outfitted the nation with a Congress in
which power is split among three parties, and while the electorate
was choosing the presidential candidate of a conservative party,
Mexico City voters elected the candidate of the leftist Democratic
Revolutionary Party to their powerful mayoralty.
</P>
<P>
   The only coherent command from that muddle is ``change.'' It
will take an exceptional leader to define the change and assemble
and sustain a constituency for it.
</P>
<P>
   It is promising that all early indications point to a civil
transition, as Zedillo has promised. (And maybe even one less
marred than usual by outgoing retainers grubbing pesos at every
political checkpoint.)
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, little has become the PRI so much in recent years as
the manner of its leaving. Zedillo's predecessor, Carlos Salinas de
Gortari, though he fled into exile from financial corruption
charges, initiated electoral reforms, responding to domestic and
international pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo added political and judicial reforms and used the 1994
financial crisis to install structural economic changes that have
stabilized the economy, making political change more possible and
its promise more credible.
</P>
<P>
   The risk now is that Fox has raised popular expectations so high
the inevitable shortfalls will be disillusioning rather than just
disappointing. A wise U.S. policy will calculate what it can do to
help reduce that risk.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: HI-DEF TV GOES BLURRY
 &HT;    Moving in (k) Commentary and (l) lifestyle categories for
release Sunday, July 9.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Where would we be today if the TV networks had
decided back in the early 1960s to end their occasional colorcasts
and let us continue to watch their programs on small
black-and-white receivers?
</P>
<P>
   Americans nowadays own some 250 million television sets, largely
color models. That's because the TV moguls met the challenge posed
by the Hollywood big screen.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, today's top-end video picture is a lot more blurry
and a lot less bright.
</P>
<P>
   TV broadcasters have reneged on their pledge to Congress and the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to roll out high-definition
TV (HDTV) by the middle of the decade. They've come up with another
idea for how to use the public spectrum, allotted for HDTV
broadcasts and worth tens of billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC is partly to blame, because it allowed digital signals
to be transmitted in 18 different formats, none of which is readily
compatible with today's cable boxes. No wonder that HDTV sets,
which must be able to convert each format, cost so much and sell so
poorly. (You can get a dazzling picture on a $750 computer
monitor.)
</P>
<P>
   Now Disney, which owns ABC, has dealt a one-two punch to
prospects for a major breakthrough in picture and sound quality
during any reasonable time frame.
</P>
<P>
   Some 20 months after the first HDTV broadcasts began, ABC has
pulled the plug on HDTV ``Monday Night Football'' for the coming
season. With even fewer HDTV shows to watch _ there weren't all
that many anyway _ would-be buyers have yet another reason to
remain off the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   On top of this programming pullback, Disney-ABC wants the FCC to
uproot the current digital TV standards and replace them with
another system that's being used in Europe. In late June, the
agency agreed to study the matter. Any such switch would render
obsolete the 120,000 or so pricey sets in pioneering hi-tech U.S.
households.
</P>
<P>
   Some insiders suggest there's other agenda at work for the
switch, beyond the allegedly poor urban reception problem cited by
Disney and its industry allies as reason enough to make a
standards' switch.
</P>
<P>
   Using the European method to send out digital video signals
would enable broadcasters to marketing six-way ``multiplexed''
non-HDTV programming to urban cable customers. Only one of the
``plexes'' would be free.
</P>
<P>
   By using a common decoder box, they could band together in each
city to offer a degraded, but still acceptable, digital signal, on
a wireless subscription basis, that would effectively replicate
what cable now offers.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers also suspect broadcasters would like consumers to
forget about HDTV so they don't have to spend the money on a fully
featured upgrade. Says Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who chairs the
Senate Commerce Committee: ``Having first lost the auction value of
the spectrum, the public now has no real certainty of what they're
likely to get in return or when they're likely to get it. And I
won't accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the broadcasters are a wily lot, and McCain is but one
voice. So if you're keen on the clear glories of HDTV, you might
need to stay de-tuned awhile longer.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: An apology for everything
 &HT;    For release July 9, 2000.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With each passing day, we are exposed to newer and more
imaginative forms of political correctness. It is obvious that
there are no bounds, no time limits. Last week, the Hartford
Courant, the nation's longest continuously published daily
newspaper, apologized in a front page story for accepting
advertising from 1764 until 1823 for the sale of slaves and the
capture of runaways.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's discovery of its past, it said, was rooted in an
apology earlier this year by Aetna, the Hartford-based insurance
company, for selling policies to slave owners.
</P>
<P>
   This is but another in a growing series of apologies for
centuries- and millenniums-old abuses of people because of their
race, their religion or their thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody seemingly is demanding of everyone else some sort of
apology, certainly due but somewhat outdated. If it makes the
Hartford Courant feel good about apologizing, then more power to
them. Same for Aetna.
</P>
<P>
   So let's talk about getting some more apologies. Take runaway
slaves. It would be nice for the descendants of Andrew Jackson to
apologize for his military forays into then Spanish Florida in 1818
to capture slaves who had run away from Georgia and Alabama
plantations and been accepted by the Seminole Indians.
</P>
<P>
   His high success rate got him a military governorship of Florida
once Spain ceded it to the United States and, eventually, the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   I have first-hand knowledge (and microfilm printouts) of
newspapers in Miami in the 1920s and 1930s accepting advertising
for apartment houses and hotels that included the language
``restricted'' or ``Gentiles only.'' Is an apology due for that as
well?
</P>
<P>
   There are as many apologies due for wrongdoing as there probably
are days remaining in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Truman, when he died in 1972, still was waiting for the
Japanese to apologize for Pearl Harbor, and so are the rest of us
to this very day.
</P>
<P>
   The pope has apologized to the Jews for earlier Christian
targeting of them in the betrayal of Jesus Christ, the Germans have
apologized (and paid dearly in cash) for the Holocaust, Bill
Clinton has apologized to us for being caught lying and to Monica
for taking advantage of her misplaced passion, Bill Buckner has
apologized a thousand times to Red Sox fans for letting that ball
slip through his legs in the 1986 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's John Rocker who, no matter how many times he
apologizes for his stupid remarks, will not find redemption because
people won't let it happen. And, besides, he's a blockhead.
</P>
<P>
   I would imagine the Hartford Courant stirred the pot more by
admitting its old role than cooled it.
</P>
<P>
   Can you imagine those staid Connecticut Yankees being told in
the year 2000 that slaves once were hawked through their daily
newspaper? They probably thought they were clean of the filth of
slavery, that only the South had its hands dirty. And now the local
newspaper exposes them and itself!
</P>
<P>
   Likely, similar advertising was taking place in newspapers all
over the North then, but those papers haven't survived to
apologize. Let's find out who they were, anyway. Let's expose some
more of those Yankees for their hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   I will assure you that apology is not what today's
African-American population is most in need of. Yes, it's
politically correct to cleanse yourself of assumed earlier sins _
even if you or your antecedents, most of whom still were in Europe
or Latin America during the American slavery era, and being
periodically bopped over the head themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But ghettos replaced slave plantations (in the North, too) and
they, like the old plantations, didn't alter too much the
lifestyles of the people who live there, except on paper.
</P>
<P>
   As a people, we constantly are angry with each other over
something and insistent on apology as if that can correct the
previous wrong done. I'm not contending that an apology is a
complete waste of time but I recommend as a better way of
correcting things, the motto of my old (Southern) high school: Non
verbis sed operis (not words but deeds).
</P>
<P>
   (Gee, I hope I got that right. If not, I apologize.)

 &HT;    RESENDING TO CORRECT FOURTH PARAGRAPH FROM BOTTOM
 &HT;    COMMENTARY: An apology for everything
 &HT;    For release July 9, 2000.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With each passing day, we are exposed to newer and more
imaginative forms of political correctness. It is obvious that
there are no bounds, no time limits. Last week, the Hartford
Courant, the nation's longest continuously published daily
newspaper, apologized in a front page story for accepting
advertising from 1764 until 1823 for the sale of slaves and the
capture of runaways.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's discovery of its past, it said, was rooted in an
apology earlier this year by Aetna, the Hartford-based insurance
company, for selling policies to slave owners.
</P>
<P>
   This is but another in a growing series of apologies for
centuries- and millenniums-old abuses of people because of their
race, their religion or their thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody seemingly is demanding of everyone else some sort of
apology, certainly due but somewhat outdated. If it makes the
Hartford Courant feel good about apologizing, then more power to
them. Same for Aetna.

 &HT;    A trip to the vet leaves the cats stressed
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cats are in dire need of psychological counseling. They have
post-traumatic stress syndrome after a recent foray to the
veterinarian, a trip that's been delayed far too long because I
knew it would be unpleasant.
</P>
<P>
   Otto, the 13-pound street tomcat who adopted me three years ago,
and Kiki, the 5-pound Siamese step-cat who regards me as the evil
step-owner, are confirmed homebodies. I can predict almost to the
minute where you will find either of these cats at any given time:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  6 a.m. They are on the back porch impatiently waiting for me
to get my lazy rear up and feed them their allotted can of cat
food. Kiki will be at the door, nudging it with her pea brain in
vain hopes it will somehow miraculously open. Otto will be
stretched out in my Adirondack chair.
</P>
<P>
   If I sleep in on a weekend until, say, 7 a.m., I still often
must get up and feed the cats or they'll meow and raise a ruckus
until sleep is impossible.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  7:30 a.m. Kiki will come inside to eat dry cat food while Otto
will go on an early morning rat-hunting expedition.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lunchtime: Both cats will come inside as soon as somebody
comes home to let them in. Otto will sleep the rest of the
afternoon in my desk chair. Kiki sleeps in the game room on the
futon. There are slight variations in sleeping spots, but only
slight.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Dusk: Both cats sleep on the back porch, with occasional bouts
of chasing each other around the yard, interspersed with serious
snoozing and occasional bug-catching.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  NIghttime: Otto hunts rats while Kiki sleeps on top of the
fence, safe from predators. She doesn't weigh much more than a fat
squirrel.
</P>
<P>
   If we leave town, we must make arrangements for someone to house
sit the cats, even if children are still home. We made the mistake
of leaving the cats inside with a litter box once. They went nuts
trying to get outside, clawing up carpet by the doors. Similarly,
they go nuts trying to get inside after a day or so if we're gone,
scratching the paint. A house sitter is cheaper than new carpet and
paint.
</P>
<P>
   These cats are Republicans. They don't like change. That is my
only excuse for having gone two years without taking them to the
vet. The only thing worse than a mad cat is a mad woman, and it's a
close call. Besides, they're both healthy as can be, which was
confirmed by the vet once I finally got them there.
</P>
<P>
   Kiki went first. I snatched her up and wrestled her into the
cat-carrier, with a loud wailing and gnashing of teeth. Hers, too.
By the time I picked her up at lunch (I actually took a vacation
day to deal with hauling cats to the vet), she had turned into a
feline version of Linda Blair in ``The Exorcist.'' The assistant at
the clinic informed me I would have to help get her out of their
cage and into mine, because she was hissing and clawing at
everything in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, Kiki does not like me, either. We have an uneasy
relationship. She loves my wife, tolerates Otto, but has little use
for any other living creature in the world. So it did not reassure
her to have me saying, in that stupid kitty voice you have to use,
``That's OK, Kiki, we're just going to go home, now.''
</P>
<P>
   Rrreahhhh! I don't know how to spell that sound cats make when
freaked, but you get the idea. I asked if the clinic had any thick
gloves. Kiki would rip me apart just as quickly as a stranger.
Another employee took charge and cornered her and had her in my
cat-carrier in no time. I got home, gave her some more canned food,
and she has spent the last several hours sleeping in the garden and
casting a baleful eye in my direction.
</P>
<P>
   Otto, on the other hand, acted like this was a day in the park.
I put him in the cage with no problem. He meowed a few times on the
way to the clinic, but nothing untoward. He stood on the table,
took his shots and happily accepted ear scratching from all the
two-legged creatures in the room with him. Then he got back in the
cat-carrier, came home, ate some lunch and crashed. But he's still
a bit miffed and cool toward me, whom formerly he thought of as
king of the world _ at least as much as any cat does of its owner.
</P>
<P>
   Both cats were pronounced fit and healthy, though Kiki has a
tartar problem with her teeth, making another appointment
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   I guess Otto has done a better job flossing. Probably it's all
those rat bones.

 &HT;    Are you missing a beagle?
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was sitting in my recliner Sunday afternoon trying to decide
what was the most important task at hand; clean out the car or mow
the backyard. Neither one of the these chores should be tacked
without a fair amount of thought. Sometimes, if I think about them
long enough, it's time for bed.
</P>
<P>
   The wife was in the kitchen mopping the floor (obviously unaware
that such jobs need hours of study before diving into them) when
she called me in a tone that could only mean one thing: She wanted
me to do something that involved work.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out that when she opened the door into the garage, there
on the mat was a dog. But not just any dog, a beagle, a beagle with
no collar. I've had beagles all my life. I've raised beagles. I
have two beagles in the backyard right now. Now a beagle with no
collar is not surprising. The breed is known for slipping collars.
What was out of character was that she wasn't running, nose to the
ground. Obviously, this beagle had run until she couldn't run
anymore and ended up in our garage.
</P>
<P>
   She gladly came inside, checked out every room, and decided she
would bed down in the den. Trying to move a beagle is like trying
to move a towsack with two pigs in it. Try to pick her up and she'd
roll over onto her back. Finally, we were able to get her out the
door into the backyard so she could meet her dog hosts.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest daughter made a sign that said; ``Found, one
beagle,'' and taped it to the mailbox. Beagle owners spend a good
deal of their time tracking down their wayward dogs. We figured it
wouldn't be long until the owner showed up.
</P>
<P>
   I was about ready to settle back down into mentally debating the
finer points of car cleaning verses mowing when the youngest
daughter brings me what looks like a tiny black pebble. She says
it's a bug. I smushed it and the blood that oozed out left no doubt
that what we had here was a tick. Our beagle visitor must have
picked up a load of them on her run and now she had spread them
into every room of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Quick as a flash I jump into action. I have the girls start
vacuuming. Tell the wife to redouble her efforts on mopping and I
got out the flea and tick powder.
</P>
<P>
   The dogs hate to be dusted almost as much as I hate to do it; I
usually end up with more powder on me than on the dogs.
</P>
<P>
   So the house is covered in ticks, I'm covered in flea power and
our dogs are wondering why there's a strange animal in the
backyard.
</P>
<P>
   I'm beginning to wonder if her owners are out of town for the
weekend. The beagle, however, seems to be perfectly content to
sleep and eat.
</P>
<P>
   Check and see if you're missing a beagle. If so, I think I may
have yours, ticks and all. This whole episode has put me way behind
in fully understanding the merits of car cleaning and grass mowing.

 &HT;    Exposing the flaws in the system
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If he had been an upstanding citizen, Ernesto Miranda would
undoubtedly have passed through life with little notice.
</P>
<P>
   Because he wasn't, Miranda, a repeat offender, lent his last
name to a litany repeated nightly on television and in real life.
``You have the right to remain silent,'' it begins.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, Miranda, who dropped out of school in the eighth grade,
was arrested on a charge of rape. The victim was an 18-year-old
woman in Phoenix with mild mental retardation. Two hours after
entering a police interrogation room, Miranda signed a confession.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, no one bothered to tell Miranda what people with
money to hire a good lawyer would have been told: He didn't have to
talk.
</P>
<P>
   At trial, Miranda's lawyer objected to the admission of the
confession, but was overruled. Sentenced to 20 years, Miranda
appealed. In 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that if criminal
defendants are not properly advised of those rights, any statements
they make are inadmissable.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda was not carried out of prison on anyone's shoulders. On
retrial, he was convicted on evidence other than the confession.
Paroled in 1972, he wore out the revolving door on Arizona's
prisons. Miranda died in a bar fight in 1976, having wasted most of
his 34 years of life. What survives him is the warning that bears
his name. That fundamental right was upheld last week by the U.S.
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Clarence Earl Gideon was the kind of fellow most of us would
avoid if we saw him on the street. Gideon had seen the inside of a
lot of jail cells since running away from home at 16 to become a
hobo.
</P>
<P>
   Like Miranda, he dropped out of school in the eighth grade. And
like Miranda, Gideon cast a long shadow over the nation's criminal
justice system. He contributed this piece of the litany: ``You have
the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney one will
be appointed for you''
</P>
<P>
   Arrested in 1961 on a charge of breaking into a Florida pool
hall, the 51-year-old Gideon told the judge he wanted a lawyer but
couldn't afford one.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad, the judge said. Guilty, the jury said.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Gideon's handwritten petition, U.S. Supreme Court
ruled that ``in our adversary system of criminal justice, any
person hauled into court, who is too poor to hire a lawyer, cannot
be assured a fair trial unless counsel is provided for him. This
seems to us to be an obvious truth.''
</P>
<P>
   On retrial, Gideon was acquitted. Later, Gideon _ who obviously
had no trouble overcoming humility _ told a judge: ``I believe I've
freed more people than Jesus Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   This savior, however, died in obscurity in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   David Ruiz is a career armed robber who first ran afoul of the
law at 16. Like Gideon and Miranda, Ruiz is no candidate for
citizen of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Ruiz, a native Austinite, distinguished himself by
being the lead plaintiff in the longest-running prison reform
lawsuit in the nation. As a result of that suit, the courts ruled
that even convicts have fundamental rights.
</P>
<P>
   Released in the mid-1980s, Ruiz came home to something
resembling a hero's welcome. He found honest work for a while, but
evidently couldn't stay away from his former life. He took part in
the armed robbery of a bar in East Austin, was convicted and sent
back to prison. He is still there.
</P>
<P>
   No, these aren't heroes. The cracks and fissures in the criminal
justice system, however, are usually exposed by people you wouldn't
invite to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   That brings us to Gary Graham, whom some are naively painting as
some kind of hero. He wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Graham shot people and he robbed and he raped. But he protested
to the last that he didn't commit the murder that landed him on
death row.
</P>
<P>
   He went to trial five months after arrest and the trial that
cost him his life lasted less than week _ start to finish. It is
highly doubtful that the defense investigation was either vigorous
or thorough in that short a time.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the Graham execution note that his conviction was
reviewed by 20 different courts and upheld. That kind of unwavering
faith in the infallibility of the criminal justice system demands
belief that O.J. Simpson is innocent.
</P>
<P>
   A society's values are reflected in the way it metes out justice
to its poorest and even its most loathsome citizens. To turn a
blind eye to the brutal realities of the system's imperfections is
to lower ourselves to the level of those who don't blink an eye or
feel the least bit of remorse for the damage they do.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Whenever a celebrity is involved in a small aircraft crash or
even a scare in the skies, a journalistic colleague of mine
displays none of the semi-authentic empathy you'll see oozing from
other media types.
</P>
<P>
   Nope, my friend snorts and raises an I-told-you-so eyebrow, and
puts a new twist on a familiar quote:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just another example of the self-cleaning oven of
Darwinism, taken to its highest level,'' she says matter-of-factly.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean to dehumanize these talented if self-indulgent
artisans and their propensity for zooming around in their own
flying machines. When someone like singer John Denver dies in a
bizarre flying accident, it's obviously the most terrible,
unspeakably heartbreaking tragedy for these immensely talented
individuals and for anyone who knows them and cares about them _
not to mention the millions of fans who feel the loss on some
level.
</P>
<P>
   But let's be honest; let's admit that when famous people have
these kinds of mishaps, some of us withhold at least a portion of
our sympathy because we believe that only odds-defying daredevils
and reckless thrill-seekers will repeatedly take to the skies in
relatively tiny toys that seem to burn and crash with more
regularity than, say, 747s.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the stories of two machismo-tinted actors who recently
had to make emergency landings _ Mr. Dirty Dancing, Patrick Swayze,
and Harrison Ford, he of the deadpan delivery, steadfast reluctance
to talk to the media (a personality trait he's revealed in perhaps
300 interviews with the media) and the mysteriously goofy and quite
butch haircut and earring.
</P>
<P>
   Short guys first. In June, Swayze was flying his 1978
twin-engine Cessna 414-A from Van Nuys, Calif., to Las Vegas when
he was forced to make an emergency landing in a half-finished
subdivision in central Arizona, hitting a light pole and tearing
off part of a wing.
</P>
<P>
   Swayze walked away uninjured _ but the story didn't end there.
</P>
<P>
   First we heard reports that Swayze was engaging in ``erratic
behavior,'' that he had bloodshot eyes and that police were unable
to question him for 12 hours after the crash-landing.
</P>
<P>
   Then three men who at first denied witnessing the crash said
they actually helped Swayze remove a half-consumed 30-pack of beer
and a nearly empty bottle of wine from the plane before they all
went to a hotel. The men were charged with failing to tell police
about this alleged behavior, but as of this writing Swayze hasn't
been charged with anything.
</P>
<P>
   And now we've been told Swayze's seemingly befuddled condition
could have been caused by a broken clamp on a pressure hose in the
cabin, combined with his habit of chain-smoking. God, don't tell
the kids about this or they'll start simulating it at rave parties.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, Harrison ``Han Solo'' Ford was flying his
Beechcraft Bonanza over Nebraska when he encountered dangerous wind
shear and had to make a quick landing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was potentially a very dangerous situation,'' said an
official at the Lincoln Municipal Airport. ``He's either very
experienced or darn lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   (The airport official's name: John Kennedy if you can believe
it. Which brings to mind another celebrity pilot, JFK Jr., whose
inexperience possibly cost him, his wife and his wife's sister
their lives in a plane crash.)
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Ford has been ``lucky.'' Last fall,
he was learning how to fly a Bell 206 JetRanger helicopter at the
Van Nuys airport when it went down in a dry riverbed about 45 miles
northwest of Los Angeles. Neither Ford nor his instructor were
harmed.
</P>
<P>
   And while Swayze and Ford were breathing sighs of relief from
their near-tragedies, two well-known horse racing jockeys in Great
Britain were doing the same. Italian-born racing legend Frank
Dettori and Ray Cochrane were in a Piper Seneca aircraft when it
crashed at Newmarket and burst into flames near a racetrack. The
pilot was killed, but the jockeys managed to escape with cuts and
bruises and some broken bones, but no life-threatening injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The beloved John Travolta, who for years has talked about his
passion for flying his own planes, has been equally fortunate on at
least two occasions.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1999, Travolta's plane was forced to make an
emergency landing at Logan International Airport in Boston when an
engine on his Boeing 707 overheated.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years prior to that, Travolta was in the vicinity of
Washington, D.C., at the controls of a Gulfstream II turbojet
carrying a half-dozen passengers when the electrical system failed,
the lights went out and the radio died. Air traffic at four
airports was suspended as Travolta tried to rendezvous with a USAir
Boeing 727 to follow it ``home.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Transportation Safety Board, the
planes narrowly avoided a midair collision. Finally Travolta
managed to navigate his way to safety, making an emergency landing
that did some damage to his plane but left him and his precious
human cargo intact.
</P>
<P>
   Other celebs who have survived emergency landings: Rod Stewart;
Jimmy Buffett (who actually swam to safety after his plane went
down); Kirk Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the list of famous figures who weren't so fortunate in
(mostly) small planes and helicopters is much longer. It includes
the aforementioned Denver, Collins, and JFK Jr.'s three-person
party, as well as Payne Stewart; Otis Redding; Hale Boggs; Rick
Nelson; John Tower; Knute Rockne; Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and
the Big Bopper; Rocky Marciano; Thurman Munson; Sen. John Heinz;
eight members of Reba McEntire's band; Will Rogers; Stevie Ray
Vaughan; Patsy Cline; Jim Croce, and several members of Lynyrd
Skynyrd.
</P>
<P>
   Some celebrities, including Aretha Franklin and John Madden,
refuse to fly commercial airlines, let alone small aircraft.
Others, e.g., Wayne Gretzky and Luther Vandross, hate flying but
endure it because they have to. Of course that's irrational and of
course they're more at risk on trains or on the highways, but you
consider the above roster and you wonder if the grounded
celebrities are the ones exercising true logic.

 By ERIC WILSON 
 From W magazine) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ While Liz Claiborne _ the company _ has grown into a
$2.8 billion apparel giant over the past 10 years, to the point
that someone buys a product created by the company five times every
second, Liz Claiborne _ the woman _ hasn't really thought about
clothes much more than five times in the entire decade.
 &HT;    She's been more concerned with the fate of elephants in Myanmar,
fish and eagles in Madagascar and European brown bears in the
Carpathian Mountains of Romania, among a roster of other wildlife
conservancy issues, all of which she and her husband and business
mentor, Art Ortenberg, have championed since they willfully
divorced themselves from the apparel industry 11 years ago to
pursue adventures in the West.
 &HT;    It would hardly be fair to call the couple's retirement an
inactive one, yet to most of the industry, having heard hardly a
peep from the designer since she left, the idea of Liz Claiborne as
a person has simply faded into a legend behind what has become one
of fashion's most powerful corporations.
 &HT;    The persona issue is one that Liz Claiborne, the woman, has had
to deal with, as well.
 &HT;    ``Today, it doesn't really mean that much to me,'' she said
recently, breezing into the offices of the Liz Claiborne and Art
Ortenberg Foundation, located 15 stories above the Liz Claiborne
flagship on Fifth Avenue.
 &HT;    ``It's another part of me that isn't at the front of my
awareness these days,'' she said. ``When I'm in Montana and someone
comes up to me and says, 'Aren't you Liz Claiborne?' it takes me a
second to realize what they are asking.''
 &HT;    Claiborne is 71 and looks nearly the same as she did when she
retired. She is tan and wears a black T-shirt and pants, a white
Liz Claiborne jeans jacket and big, red Liz Claiborne glasses, all
of them kept from her days at the helm of the company.
 &HT;    The only thing not Liz Claiborne about her is a white Polo Sport
cap, which she wears to mask the result of chemotherapy treatments
for a rare cancer that affects the lining between the abdomen and
the reproductive organs, with which she was diagnosed three years
ago.
 &HT;    She is near the end of her treatments and doing well, Claiborne
said, and recently accepted the Council of Fashion Designers of
America's Humanitarian Award for the work she and Ortenberg have
done through their foundation.
 &HT;    The foundation devotes a substantial portion of its funds to
Third World countries, supporting more than 50 conservation
programs in the United States, Africa, Asia and Central and South
America.
 &HT;    To a large degree, Claiborne is still fed up with a number of
things about the fashion industry. Always outspoken during her
career, Claiborne often complained about women's roles in the
industry and department-store chargebacks, and during this
interview last week, she made it clear that her view of the
industry has not necessarily improved with age:
 &HT;    
 &HT;     QUESTION:  What have you been up to for the past decade?
 &HT;     LIZ CLAIBORNE:  We happened to have been enjoying the benefits
of having been in the fashion industry, meaning monetarily, and
enjoying our lives. We're very involved in the foundation. We have
ranches in Montana, and then we have a house in St. Barths.
 &HT;    We hadn't planned Montana. We had planned the West. Art had felt
it would be nice to have a place out West, and I couldn't have
agreed more _ I'd always loved horses. Art's assistant at the time
was helping to plan a trip to Canada and she had subscribed to a
magazine called the Hideaway Report. She said, ``On your way to
Canada, why don't you stop off, because it sounds like the kind of
place you'd like.''
 &HT;    And yes, we never got to Canada. We stayed there and we bought a
lodge that took in paying guests. We discovered it was for sale and
we bought it, almost on the spot, after four days. It was perfect
for us. We love Montana because it's different than other areas of
the West, such as Colorado and New Mexico, that are very populated
areas. Montana is tiny.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  Have you maintained any connections to the fashion
industry?
 &HT;     A:  Not at all, except for friends. When we left, we left.
 &HT;    I gather the industry is very different today. It's not as much
fun. It's harder and everything is concentrated. I know I
complained about it then, but I'll complain about it today. The
stores are overstocked. It's hard to find individual looking
things. There's quite a sameness going on, but I guess that always
existed. I'm sure 10 or 15 years ago, I'd be saying the same thing.
 &HT;    But I gather from some of my old friends that it's not as much
fun as it used to be. There was at least some discussion of style
then and what really is important from a fashion point of view for
the department store. Today, I gather, it is all the bottom line.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  How does it feel to be Liz Claiborne today?
 &HT;     A:  Honestly, it feels pretty good. We did achieve a wonderful
company and what we have been able to do with the money we made out
of that company is something Art and I are both very proud of and
will continue to be proud of as it goes further. I'm 71 and I feel
pretty good.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  Do you feel women's roles in fashion have changed?
 &HT;     A:  I feel that hasn't really happened, except for a few
exceptions _ and one really publicized one _ and certainly at the
company, referring to Liz Claiborne, it hasn't really happened.
 &HT;    There is a glass ceiling. All the top echelon of people who
really make the decisions are male, but the second string is a very
open position for women. I still feel the minute it comes to real
heavy business types of decisions encompassing a whole company or a
whole department store, there are very few women who are in
control, except for Linda Wachner, who I was referring to earlier,
who's having her own problems, none of which have to do with being
female.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  How do you feel about that situation? (Calvin Klein sued
Wachner, his biggest licensee, last month, over what he called
trademark violations and breach of fiduciary duty. Wachner
countersued.)
 &HT;     A:  I have to say I'm really on Calvin's side. I can't help but
be on Calvin's side. In this country in particular, you have very
little control over your designer name once you have sold it or
licensed it.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  What do you find in stores today?
 &HT;     A:  I hate to name names, but I gravitate toward a few
designers, though I will shop at stores that are not department
stores.
 &HT;    I'll shop at the Banana Republic because they have some simple
things that I like. I shop at Ralph Lauren a lot these days. He has
a taste level and that all-American look, and I admire him for
being able to change while maintaining that taste level.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  When Liz Claiborne first started opening its own stores,
you said New York would not be an ideal location. Today, the
Claiborne flagship is downstairs.
 &HT;     A:  That was a coincidence. We were in this space before the
store was, and, as a matter of fact, we got a letter from the
gentleman who was the head of retail, apologizing and saying,
``You're not going to be happy about this, but we're moving in.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  One of the greatest successes of Liz Claiborne during your
tenure was the creation of a line of clothing that women could wear
to the office _ career clothes. It's an interesting point where we
are today, when men and women alike are having a difficult time
understanding how to dress themselves casually for careers.
 &HT;     A:  I would think so. There were certain codes then, although
we never had a code. Although the company became known for career
dressing, it was never one of my principals going into business.
 &HT;    Having been a designer all my adult life, I didn't feel you had
to dress in this business suit as a woman and try to be competitive
with men in your dress. I felt you could dress in a much _ not
softer, but less tailored way _ and more colorfully.
 &HT;    We never really were an Evan Picone or a Jones in their navy
blue suits. I never was considered good at that, but I felt women
did want to look put together and should look put together at the
office, so what we tried to do was to pre-digest looks and put them
out so that they were highly understandable and they would put them
together the way they wanted to. They were never sold as units,
they were always sold as separates, but color coordinated, which
was one of the keys, and the way it was displayed was terribly
important, which is why today I say it is more difficult because
everything looks like a bargain basement, no matter what the price.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  When you started your business, did you ever think you
would be a star?
 &HT;     A:  No. It was at an event when I used to travel the country a
lot and do fashion shows and personal appearances. It had gotten to
the point they had scheduled me very tightly _ I had to do a
breakfast show, a luncheon show and fly to another city to do an
evening show. Once the plane was late getting to the other city,
something like an hour and a half, and I thought, ``Well they've
gone ahead with the show,'' and when I landed they greeted me and
said, ``If you can rush there, everybody is still waiting.''
 &HT;    I changed in the hotel room in about two seconds flat and went
out, and when I walked in that room, the applause. I still get
emotional about it, because it was the first time I realized it was
like being a star for a short while.
 &HT;    It was a great feeling, but it was a feeling also of
responsibility when you have women reacting that way and depending
on you. They were very quick also to write me when they didn't like
me. In one year, I got bombarded for a season when they didn't like
their clothes. They didn't buy them and they told me so, so you
realize that you've got to measure up.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  What do you think was the most important contribution you
have made to American fashion over the years?
 &HT;     A:  I think fashion and quality at a price, before it was
readily available. There were the designers, and then there was
what was called better sportswear, which was uptight stuff. There
wasn't much in between.
 &HT;    And responding to that woman out there. She wasn't a kid. She
was somebody who was working, whether she was a teacher or in a
business environment or a nurse, and somehow I had a rapport with
her and understood what she needed.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  You once said your parents were displeased when you told
them that you wanted to be a dress designer.
 &HT;     A:  Rather. My father was very old-fashioned, to the point
where I never went to school, because it wasn't mandatory in Europe
for a girl to go to school, particularly an American citizen.
(Claiborne grew up in Brussels.) He wanted me to be a painter.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  Once the company became successful, did he change his
opinion?
 &HT;     A:  I think he was proud of the success of the company, but he
wouldn't invest in it. He never told me so, but I'm sure he was
proud of me.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  How are you doing with your treatments?
 &HT;     A:  I'm at just about the end of it, but they still want me to
have a few more treatments, and it gets a little bit more difficult
as you get to the end, because your body has had so much, and it
takes a little bit longer to recuperate.
 &HT;    But I feel great and when I first heard I was going to have to
go through chemo, I thought, ``Oh my God, this is terrible,'' but
it's not that bad. It really is not, and I'd like to be able to
tell everybody that. So, you spend a bad day or two or three bad
days a month. Anybody can do that.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  Would you ever design again?
 &HT;     A:  I still love fashion, mind you, and I love clothes. I'll
never get over that, and thank God for the fashion industry, but
no, it's not for me anymore.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  Any other thoughts?
 &HT;     A:  It used to be very exciting to work in the fashion industry
from every point of view, and the business point of view as well,
because if you didn't sell, there was no point in being in
business. I think my biggest kick as a designer was seeing my
clothes walk down the street, and being able to recognize my
clothes on so many people. That was a big thrill.

 COMPILED THE EDITORS AT FAIRCHILD PUBLICATIONS 
 From WWD, W magazine and DNR 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 DONNA'S NEW CAMPAIGN FULFILLS HER DREAM  
 &HT;    ``It's always been a dream of mine to do movies,'' said Donna
Karan, describing the cinematic quality of her fall Collection
campaign.
 &HT;    ``I've always seen my company as a moving experience, as opposed
to a still, from the very first (campaign) shot of a moving car.''
 &HT;    For fall, Karan returns to storytelling in her new ads that
feature actors Milla Jovovich and Gary Oldman, who appeared
together in the film ``The Fifth Element.''
 &HT;    The ads focus on the relationship, emotions and lifestyle of the
couple, unlike recent campaigns that were more product-focused,
said Trey Laird, executive vice-president and corporate creative
director.
 &HT;    ``It's been good that we've done it,'' said Laird of his past
campaigns, ``but sometimes you need to step back and give a healthy
dose of good brand imagery.''
 &HT;    For fall, the company hired Mikael Jansson to photograph, got
the assistance of creative director Fabien Baron and stylist Karl
Templer, hired the actors and headed to France.
 &HT;    ``We set it up like a movie and shot it in Paris. We tried to
capture a relationship between these two characters and what was
going on in their lives,'' Laird said.
 &HT;    ``They make you think, `Do they really get along?''' said Karan.
``Definitely, it's intense. It's like any relationship today. I
wish I had more photographs to show all the aspects of their lives.
The two of them have a chemistry.''
 &HT;    Eight-page inserts will break in the September issues of Vogue,
W and Vanity Fair, and spreads will run in the New York Times
Magazine, Harper's Bazaar, Wallpaper and V. Ads will also appear in
the October issue of Details.
 &HT;    
 SPARKLING DONATION  
 &HT;    Because Elizabeth Taylor was recently proclaimed a Dame of the
British Empire, her fragrance licensee, Elizabeth Arden, is
celebrating by making a donation to her AIDS foundation.
 &HT;    Through August, the company will donate a portion of the
proceeds from sales of Elizabeth Taylor Sparkling White Diamonds.
 &HT;    ``We wanted to honor Dame Elizabeth with a meaningful gift,''
said Susan Taylor, managing director, Elizabeth Arden, U.K. ``We
believe we will be able to donate a substantial sum by the end of
the summer.''
 &HT;    Elizabeth Taylor Sparkling White Diamonds, which launched in the
United States last year, is now available at the 90 branches of
Debenhams throughout the United Kingdom.
 &HT;    
 Golden Greek  
 &HT;    Several biographers have tried in vain to figure out Stavros
Niarchos, the Greek shipping tycoon who died in 1996. But an
upcoming memoir by John Frangoulis, the longtime captain of
Niarchos' yacht, the Creole, should shed more light on the
reclusive billionnaire.
 &HT;    Frangoulis details many of Niarchos' eccentric habits, including
his insistence that his favorite van Goghs be on board the boat
whenever he was _ never mind that they'd be ruined by the sea air.
 &HT;    Then there was Niarchos' habit of swimming nude while an armed
guard stood on deck, checking for sharks.
 &HT;    The book, due out later this year in Europe, also has photos of
the Creole's many illustrious guests _ including the Duchess of
Windsor, who clearly wasn't the type to pack light. For one brief
stay on the boat, she showed up with 12 Vuitton steamer trunks.
 &HT;    
 MANHATTAN TRANSFER  
 &HT;    One of Los Angeles' reigning nightlife impresarios, Sean
MacPherson, is heading to New York.
 &HT;    The man behind such haunts as Smalls, the Olive, Swingers and
Bar Marmont plans to open his first New York restaurant next year
at an unspecified downtown location.
 &HT;    To help him navigate the local terrain, he'll be partnering with
Eric Goode of Bowery Bar fame.
 &HT;    ``I have a good feeling about this one,'' MacPherson says.
 &HT;    
 ROYAL BABES  
 &HT;    Prince William isn't the only pinup in the British royal family.
In the past few months, two of William's female cousins have been
setting male teens' hearts aflutter with their blond looks and
trendy fashion sense.
 &HT;    Gabriella Windsor, the 19-year-old daughter of Prince and
Princess Michael of Kent, had the British tabloids panting when she
appeared at the Badminton Horse Trials in a tight-fitting sweater
and leather Stetson. (Windsor's good looks are shared by her
brother Frederick, a model featured in the latest Burberry
campaign.)
 &HT;    Meanwhile, royal rebel Zara Phillips, 18, delighted the
paparazzi at a recent horse race by wearing a chic jacket and
thigh-high skirt.
 &HT;    Phillips, the daughter of the Princess Royal and Mark Phillips,
is dating jockey Richard Johnson; she has agreed to remove her
tongue stud in exchange for his vow to give up smoking.
 &HT;    
 FIELD DAY  
 &HT;    It's no secret that Hollywood movie stars have been earning
extra cash by appearing in ads on Italian TV: Harrison Ford has
plugged Fiat, Catherine Zeta-Jones has campaigned for Alfa Romeo
and even Brad Pitt has deigned to promote Damiani jewelry, secure
in the knowledge that the commercials would never be shown
Stateside.
 &HT;    But Kevin Costner has reportedly broken a longstanding taboo by
allowing his upcoming shoe commercial to appear in the United
States.
 &HT;    In fact, the new ad, for the mid-range Italian shoe company
Valleverde, will reportedly debut in America this fall and air
later in Europe. The commercial shows Costner walking in a field,
helping a child take its first steps.
 &HT;    
 FETISH SCENT RELAUNCHED  
 &HT;    NEW ORLEANS _ Grammy-award-winning singer Christina Aguilera is
expanding her range with a line of color cosmetics.
 &HT;    The 19-year-old international pop star is partnering with the
Boca Raton, Fla.-based New Dana Perfumes Company on a relaunch of
its teen brand Fetish.
 &HT;    The collection, expected to rollout in January, has been renamed
Fetish by Christina Aguilera. Packaging will carry the slogan
``What a Girl Wants,'' after her hit single.
 &HT;    Aguilera snagged the Grammys' ``Best New Artist'' award earlier
this year and also appeared in the Super Bowl half-time show with
Enrique Iglesias.
 &HT;    Aguilera also has promotional contracts with Levi's and recently
inked a deal with Coca Cola. With Fetish, however, she is directly
involved in product design and packaging.
 &HT;    ``I am definitely going to have a say in the products,''
Aguilera said. She has already swapped the brand's lavender
packaging for black with silver components. ``I've always been a
lover of fashion, and I enjoy playing with makeup.''
 &HT;    This time last year, as part of the Renaissance Cosmetics
Company, Fetish was in Chapter 11. p

 (Three color slides) 
 From W magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Giorgio Armani is justly celebrated for his sleek, feminine and
sophisticated style. He got Hollywood hooked on Armani, and many
loyalists, such as Michelle Pfeiffer and Jodie Foster, wear his
clothes around the clock.
 &HT;    So it isn't surprising that, in a season when accessories are in
the forefront of fashion, the designer is relaunching a terrific
collection of handbags, shoes and small leather goods.
 &HT;    ``It's a very exciting time in fashion, and accessories are a
part of that,'' Armani says. ``People are looking for ways to make
a fashion statement, not a loud, in-your-face statement, but one
that suggests their personalities and styles. Accessories are
decorative. They enhance a wardrobe, but they never become the
wardrobe.''
 &HT;    The collection consists of cleanlined pieces, many in vibrant
shades and exotic skins.
 &HT;    ``Color is wonderful,'' the designer says. ``And exotic skins
add texture and patterns, making beautiful accents for my
clothes.''
 &HT;    According to Judith Collinson, executive vice-president of
Barneys New York, ``This line is very cohesive. There is a creative
energy throughout. There's also a retro feeling to some of the
handbag designs, which is new.''
 &HT;    The looks, which Kal Ruttenstein, senior vice-president for
fashion direction at Bloomingdale's, describes as ``strong, sexy,
up-to-date and exciting,'' range from elongated python clutches in
wild colors like fuchsia and orange to bare stiletto lizard sandals
in a pale mint hue.
 &HT;    There are also more ladylike offerings: small structured
top-handle bags in ostrich and alligator or lizard mid-heel pumps,
along with colored beaded handbags and shoes for evening that
perfectly complement the designer's drop-dead eveningwear.

 SOAP STARS  
 &HT;    It has been in business since 1695, so it's pretty safe to say
that French soap and fragrance maker Roger &AMP; Gallet knows a lot
about the art of making soap.
 &HT;    Its newest products, Gardener's Special Soaps, come in such
flavors as Cherry Tomato, Lettuce and Carrot; they contain actual
vegetable extracts and smell good enough to bathe in. Available at
Henri Bendel, Nordstrom, Bloomingdale's and Marshall Fields.
 &HT;    
 MRS. FROSTY  
 &HT;    In the thick of summer, just the idea of wearing makeup can make
anyone break into a sweat. To the rescue: Aveda's new Cooling
Calming Cover Sheer Face Tint (a foundation) and Aveda Cooling
Calming Color Eye/Cheek Tint (a blush).
 &HT;    They not only keep you polished but also promise to lower body
temperature by five degrees _ thanks to formulas that contain
almost 50 percent water. And when the heat's on, this is definitely
a good thing. Aveda, (800) 283-3224.
 &HT;    
 WILD CARD  
 &HT;    With her first foray into makeup, Iman _ the Somalian
supermodel, mother-to-be and wife of David Bowie _ proved that she
knew how to do basic, wearable makeup. Now, with her creation of
I-Iman Makeup, she's showing the world her uninhibited side.
 &HT;    For this collection, Iman has unleashed a few tricks of her
trade, such as I-Matte, a gel spray that instantly seals makeup,
and I-Shimmer, an iridescent powder with glorious shine in a
rainbow of shades. Exclusively at Sephora.
 &HT;    
 CRYSTAL LIGHT  
 &HT;    When mineral makeup was first introduced a few years ago, it was
dismissed as a quirky trend.
 &HT;    Francie Willis, the owner of the Urban Retreat Day Spa in
Houston, is setting out to change that with Franche, her extensive
collection of water-resistant mineral makeup with freeze-dried
vitamins.
 &HT;    Particularly appealing is Lip Luscious, an iridescent gloss made
from plant-derived liquid crystals. Available at Henri Bendel and
at (877) 372-4243. c.2000 Fairchild Publications

LINDA BITES BACK: SUES CALVIN FOR $500 MILLION

 &HT;    
 By VICKI M. YOUNG 
 From DNR 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ Judicial resolution of the nasty brawl between Calvin
Klein Inc. and The Warnaco Group Inc. can be reduced to just one
key central issue: Did CKI's biggest licensee have any rights to
sell CK trademarked products to off-price membership clubs?
 &HT;    On June 26, Linda Wachner's Warnaco Group filed a countersuit in
Manhattan federal court against Calvin Klein Inc. seeking $500
million in damages, charging Klein with an ongoing and intentional
breach of its obligations to Warnaco, under several licensing
agreements.
 &HT;    Warnaco is suing both CKI and Calvin Klein, personally, for
defamation and trade libel, seeking at least $50 million in
compensatory and punitive damages.
 &HT;    The libel and defamation claims arise from the designer's June 5
appearance on ``Larry King Live.'' The suit says that during the
Larry King show, Klein attacked ``the quality of the (jeanswear)
product'' produced by CKI, asserting that it had been
``compromised'' and announced that ``we want our license back, and
we want it to be in the hands of a responsible manufacturing
company.''
 &HT;    CKI, in its original lawsuit, claimed that Warnaco was eroding
the Calvin Klein jeanswear and underwear lines through a flood of
discounting and other unauthorized sales and practices ``that are
the equivalent of counterfeiting.''
 &HT;    Warnaco, however, claimed in the court filing that CKI has no
right under any agreement with Warnaco to approve channels of
distribution, and that Warnaco has every right to sell Calvin Klein
jeanswear through its distribution channels.
 &HT;    ``CKI and Warnaco agreed that each would utilize distribution
outlets that were consistent 'with the reputation and prestige of
the trademarks.' In fact, CKI expressly reserved the right for it
or any of its licensees to sell Calvin Klein trademarked
products... 'in the mass merchandise market and channels of
distribution.' Warnaco expressly reserved the right to sell certain
Calvin Klein trademarked underwear in the mass merchandise
market.''
 &HT;    According to Warnaco, the warehouse membership clubs such as
Costco sell high-end fashion and accessories designs by Prada,
Gucci, DKNY, Cartier, Movado, among others.
 &HT;    In fact, Warnaco's answer to the CKI lawsuit contains 18 pages
showing the breadth of products being sold on Costo.com, including
those by Coach, Prada, Gucci Rush, Tag Heuer, Movado, Chanel, DKNY,
Tommy Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren, in addition to Calvin Klein Jeans,
cK1, Eternity by Calvin Klein and Escape by Calvin Klein.
 &HT;    The firm also said that these stores also sell and continue to
sell an array of CK-branded products made and distributed by other
licensees.
 &HT;    Warnaco is seeking a declaratory judgment to confirm those
licensees' rights to distribute CK product in the membership clubs.
 &HT;    A spokesman for CKI said, ``As the CKI complaint lays out, the
company believes that product was sold to a number of unauthorized
channels and the company believes that the evidence will show that
Warnaco knew it was unauthorized.''
 &HT;    In the original May 30 complaint by CKI, the company charged
that except for a one-time deal in which Warnaco was given the okay
to sell at a membership club to clean up inherited problems in the
distribution channel, ``since 1997, CKI has never approved Costco,
BJ's or Sam's Club as appropriate channels of regular distribution
for close-outs, seconds, or irregulars of Calvin Klein goods _ much
less sales of first-quality goods.''
 &HT;    Also in the Warnaco countersuit, the company charged that a
proposed sale on June 8, 2000, of almost $400,000 of CK jeanswear
to Mode Shirmax Fashions, a Canadian retail chain, fell through
``specifically because of statements'' made by the designer during
the Larry King interview.
 &HT;    Shirmax, Warnaco said, had projected that it would order $1.15
million in jeanswear in 2001. Another customer in Venezuela,
Warnaco said in the suit, ``reduced its order for Calvin Klein
jeanswear from $1.5 million to $500,000.''
 &HT;    The suit also charges CKI and the designer with timing the
filing of its lawsuit to coincide with a speech he gave last month
at the Fairchild CEO Summit, a gathering of fashion industry and
press planned months in advance, where, the suit claims, he
``falsely accused'' Warnaco of counterfeiting CKI apparel.
 &HT;    And, in an apparent attempt to show that CKI officials had no
prior problems with Warnaco's distribution practices _ a key
complaint and a major focus of CKI's own suit against Warnaco _ a
Warnaco press release describes a letter that Klein and his
partner, Barry Schwartz, wrote to Warnaco Oct. 6, 1999, thanking
Warnaco for its ``efforts to make our projects with you so
successful and to ask for your continued support as we move on to
the next level of creativity, productivity and rewards.'' The
letter was referring to the strategic options CKI was about to
explore in its attempt to sell or find a partner.
 &HT;    In response, CKI issued a statement saying: ``Warnaco's
announcement is a thinly veiled attempt to divert attention from
the fact that Warnaco has been systematically violating its
agreements with Calvin Klein Inc. In fact, the letter Warnaco
distributed today to substantiate its claims of support for its
activities by Calvin Klein was a courtesy form letter sent to
dozens of people on the same day last fall announcing Calvin Klein
Inc.'s exploration of strategic options _ a weak reed, indeed, on
which to base a counterclaim.''
 &HT;    The legal jab arises from the May 30 lawsuit filed by CKI and
the Calvin Klein Trademark Trust against it biggest licensee,
Warnaco, and Wachner. Warnaco and CKI are co-owners of the Calvin
Klein Trademark Trust, which owns the Calvin Klein marks.
 &HT;    The main thrust of the CKI suit _ which alleges federal
trademark violations and breach of fiduciary duty and contracts _
centers on CKI's allegations that Warnaco infringed upon and
diluted the Calvin Klein underwear and jeanswear trademarks in the
U.S. by selling unauthorized CKI goods to off-price warehouse
clubs, such as Costco, Sam's Club and BJ's Wholesale.
 &HT;    And the battle apparently is raging outside the courthouse, as
well. According to sources, CKI is trying to stop a multimillion
dollar order that Costco placed with Warnaco this spring. The
Calvin Klein Jeans order is reportedly about to go into production.
 &HT;    Warnaco also disclosed that it and CKI reached a tentative
agreement in April on a $900 million purchase price for the
company, but that Warnaco withdrew because of disagreements over
the scope of the acquisition agreement.
 &HT;    Since then, Warnaco charged, ``Mr. Klein and CKI embarked on the
inconsistent and self-destructive strategy of attacking The Warnaco
Group _ the very same entity that had once saved them from
financial ruin and now provides them in excess of $85 million
annually.''
 &HT;    The Calvin Klein jeans and underwear business under Warnaco's
umbrella represent about $1 billion in sales. Last year the
jeanswear license generated revenues just under $700 million.

 By ERIC WILSON 
 From W magazine) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ While Liz Claiborne _ the company _ has grown into a
$2.8 billion apparel giant over the past 10 years, to the point
that someone buys a product created by the company five times every
second, Liz Claiborne _ the woman _ hasn't really thought about
clothes much more than five times in the entire decade.
 &HT;    She's been more concerned with the fate of elephants in Myanmar,
fish and eagles in Madagascar and European brown bears in the
Carpathian Mountains of Romania, among a roster of other wildlife
conservancy issues, all of which she and her husband and business
mentor, Art Ortenberg, have championed since they willfully
divorced themselves from the apparel industry 11 years ago to
pursue adventures in the West.
 &HT;    It would hardly be fair to call the couple's retirement an
inactive one, yet to most of the industry, having heard hardly a
peep from the designer since she left, the idea of Liz Claiborne as
a person has simply faded into a legend behind what has become one
of fashion's most powerful corporations.
 &HT;    The persona issue is one that Liz Claiborne, the woman, has had
to deal with, as well.
 &HT;    ``Today, it doesn't really mean that much to me,'' she said
recently, breezing into the offices of the Liz Claiborne and Art
Ortenberg Foundation, located 15 stories above the Liz Claiborne
flagship on Fifth Avenue.
 &HT;    ``It's another part of me that isn't at the front of my
awareness these days,'' she said. ``When I'm in Montana and someone
comes up to me and says, 'Aren't you Liz Claiborne?' it takes me a
second to realize what they are asking.''
 &HT;    Claiborne is 71 and looks nearly the same as she did when she
retired. She is tan and wears a black T-shirt and pants, a white
Liz Claiborne jeans jacket and big, red Liz Claiborne glasses, all
of them kept from her days at the helm of the company.
 &HT;    The only thing not Liz Claiborne about her is a white Polo Sport
cap, which she wears to mask the result of chemotherapy treatments
for a rare cancer that affects the lining between the abdomen and
the reproductive organs, with which she was diagnosed three years
ago.
 &HT;    She is near the end of her treatments and doing well, Claiborne
said, and recently accepted the Council of Fashion Designers of
America's Humanitarian Award for the work she and Ortenberg have
done through their foundation.
 &HT;    The foundation devotes a substantial portion of its funds to
Third World countries, supporting more than 50 conservation
programs in the United States, Africa, Asia and Central and South
America.
 &HT;    To a large degree, Claiborne is still fed up with a number of
things about the fashion industry. Always outspoken during her
career, Claiborne often complained about women's roles in the
industry and department-store chargebacks, and during this
interview last week, she made it clear that her view of the
industry has not necessarily improved with age:
 &HT;    
 &HT;     QUESTION:  What have you been up to for the past decade?
 &HT;     LIZ CLAIBORNE:  We happened to have been enjoying the benefits
of having been in the fashion industry, meaning monetarily, and
enjoying our lives. We're very involved in the foundation. We have
ranches in Montana, and then we have a house in St. Barths.
 &HT;    We hadn't planned Montana. We had planned the West. Art had felt
it would be nice to have a place out West, and I couldn't have
agreed more _ I'd always loved horses. Art's assistant at the time
was helping to plan a trip to Canada and she had subscribed to a
magazine called the Hideaway Report. She said, ``On your way to
Canada, why don't you stop off, because it sounds like the kind of
place you'd like.''
 &HT;    And yes, we never got to Canada. We stayed there and we bought a
lodge that took in paying guests. We discovered it was for sale and
we bought it, almost on the spot, after four days. It was perfect
for us. We love Montana because it's different than other areas of
the West, such as Colorado and New Mexico, that are very populated
areas. Montana is tiny.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  Have you maintained any connections to the fashion
industry?
 &HT;     A:  Not at all, except for friends. When we left, we left.
 &HT;    I gather the industry is very different today. It's not as much
fun. It's harder and everything is concentrated. I know I
complained about it then, but I'll complain about it today. The
stores are overstocked. It's hard to find individual looking
things. There's quite a sameness going on, but I guess that always
existed. I'm sure 10 or 15 years ago, I'd be saying the same thing.
 &HT;    But I gather from some of my old friends that it's not as much
fun as it used to be. There was at least some discussion of style
then and what really is important from a fashion point of view for
the department store. Today, I gather, it is all the bottom line.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  How does it feel to be Liz Claiborne today?
 &HT;     A:  Honestly, it feels pretty good. We did achieve a wonderful
company and what we have been able to do with the money we made out
of that company is something Art and I are both very proud of and
will continue to be proud of as it goes further. I'm 71 and I feel
pretty good.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  Do you feel women's roles in fashion have changed?
 &HT;     A:  I feel that hasn't really happened, except for a few
exceptions _ and one really publicized one _ and certainly at the
company, referring to Liz Claiborne, it hasn't really happened.
 &HT;    There is a glass ceiling. All the top echelon of people who
really make the decisions are male, but the second string is a very
open position for women. I still feel the minute it comes to real
heavy business types of decisions encompassing a whole company or a
whole department store, there are very few women who are in
control, except for Linda Wachner, who I was referring to earlier,
who's having her own problems, none of which have to do with being
female.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  How do you feel about that situation? (Calvin Klein sued
Wachner, his biggest licensee, last month, over what he called
trademark violations and breach of fiduciary duty. Wachner
countersued.)
 &HT;     A:  I have to say I'm really on Calvin's side. I can't help but
be on Calvin's side. In this country in particular, you have very
little control over your designer name once you have sold it or
licensed it.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  What do you find in stores today?
 &HT;     A:  I hate to name names, but I gravitate toward a few
designers, though I will shop at stores that are not department
stores.
 &HT;    I'll shop at the Banana Republic because they have some simple
things that I like. I shop at Ralph Lauren a lot these days. He has
a taste level and that all-American look, and I admire him for
being able to change while maintaining that taste level.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  When Liz Claiborne first started opening its own stores,
you said New York would not be an ideal location. Today, the
Claiborne flagship is downstairs.
 &HT;     A:  That was a coincidence. We were in this space before the
store was, and, as a matter of fact, we got a letter from the
gentleman who was the head of retail, apologizing and saying,
``You're not going to be happy about this, but we're moving in.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  One of the greatest successes of Liz Claiborne during your
tenure was the creation of a line of clothing that women could wear
to the office _ career clothes. It's an interesting point where we
are today, when men and women alike are having a difficult time
understanding how to dress themselves casually for careers.
 &HT;     A:  I would think so. There were certain codes then, although
we never had a code. Although the company became known for career
dressing, it was never one of my principals going into business.
 &HT;    Having been a designer all my adult life, I didn't feel you had
to dress in this business suit as a woman and try to be competitive
with men in your dress. I felt you could dress in a much _ not
softer, but less tailored way _ and more colorfully.
 &HT;    We never really were an Evan Picone or a Jones in their navy
blue suits. I never was considered good at that, but I felt women
did want to look put together and should look put together at the
office, so what we tried to do was to pre-digest looks and put them
out so that they were highly understandable and they would put them
together the way they wanted to. They were never sold as units,
they were always sold as separates, but color coordinated, which
was one of the keys, and the way it was displayed was terribly
important, which is why today I say it is more difficult because
everything looks like a bargain basement, no matter what the price.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  When you started your business, did you ever think you
would be a star?
 &HT;     A:  No. It was at an event when I used to travel the country a
lot and do fashion shows and personal appearances. It had gotten to
the point they had scheduled me very tightly _ I had to do a
breakfast show, a luncheon show and fly to another city to do an
evening show. Once the plane was late getting to the other city,
something like an hour and a half, and I thought, ``Well they've
gone ahead with the show,'' and when I landed they greeted me and
said, ``If you can rush there, everybody is still waiting.''
 &HT;    I changed in the hotel room in about two seconds flat and went
out, and when I walked in that room, the applause. I still get
emotional about it, because it was the first time I realized it was
like being a star for a short while.
 &HT;    It was a great feeling, but it was a feeling also of
responsibility when you have women reacting that way and depending
on you. They were very quick also to write me when they didn't like
me. In one year, I got bombarded for a season when they didn't like
their clothes. They didn't buy them and they told me so, so you
realize that you've got to measure up.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  What do you think was the most important contribution you
have made to American fashion over the years?
 &HT;     A:  I think fashion and quality at a price, before it was
readily available. There were the designers, and then there was
what was called better sportswear, which was uptight stuff. There
wasn't much in between.
 &HT;    And responding to that woman out there. She wasn't a kid. She
was somebody who was working, whether she was a teacher or in a
business environment or a nurse, and somehow I had a rapport with
her and understood what she needed.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  You once said your parents were displeased when you told
them that you wanted to be a dress designer.
 &HT;     A:  Rather. My father was very old-fashioned, to the point
where I never went to school, because it wasn't mandatory in Europe
for a girl to go to school, particularly an American citizen.
(Claiborne grew up in Brussels.) He wanted me to be a painter.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  Once the company became successful, did he change his
opinion?
 &HT;     A:  I think he was proud of the success of the company, but he
wouldn't invest in it. He never told me so, but I'm sure he was
proud of me.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  How are you doing with your treatments?
 &HT;     A:  I'm at just about the end of it, but they still want me to
have a few more treatments, and it gets a little bit more difficult
as you get to the end, because your body has had so much, and it
takes a little bit longer to recuperate.
 &HT;    But I feel great and when I first heard I was going to have to
go through chemo, I thought, ``Oh my God, this is terrible,'' but
it's not that bad. It really is not, and I'd like to be able to
tell everybody that. So, you spend a bad day or two or three bad
days a month. Anybody can do that.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  Would you ever design again?
 &HT;     A:  I still love fashion, mind you, and I love clothes. I'll
never get over that, and thank God for the fashion industry, but
no, it's not for me anymore.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     Q:  Any other thoughts?
 &HT;     A:  It used to be very exciting to work in the fashion industry
from every point of view, and the business point of view as well,
because if you didn't sell, there was no point in being in
business. I think my biggest kick as a designer was seeing my
clothes walk down the street, and being able to recognize my
clothes on so many people. That was a big thrill.

 From WWD, W magazine and DNR 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 DONNA'S NEW CAMPAIGN FULFILLS HER DREAM  
 &HT;    ``It's always been a dream of mine to do movies,'' said Donna
Karan, describing the cinematic quality of her fall Collection
campaign.
 &HT;    ``I've always seen my company as a moving experience, as opposed
to a still, from the very first (campaign) shot of a moving car.''
 &HT;    For fall, Karan returns to storytelling in her new ads that
feature actors Milla Jovovich and Gary Oldman, who appeared
together in the film ``The Fifth Element.''
 &HT;    The ads focus on the relationship, emotions and lifestyle of the
couple, unlike recent campaigns that were more product-focused,
said Trey Laird, executive vice-president and corporate creative
director.
 &HT;    ``It's been good that we've done it,'' said Laird of his past
campaigns, ``but sometimes you need to step back and give a healthy
dose of good brand imagery.''
 &HT;    For fall, the company hired Mikael Jansson to photograph, got
the assistance of creative director Fabien Baron and stylist Karl
Templer, hired the actors and headed to France.
 &HT;    ``We set it up like a movie and shot it in Paris. We tried to
capture a relationship between these two characters and what was
going on in their lives,'' Laird said.
 &HT;    ``They make you think, `Do they really get along?''' said Karan.
``Definitely, it's intense. It's like any relationship today. I
wish I had more photographs to show all the aspects of their lives.
The two of them have a chemistry.''
 &HT;    Eight-page inserts will break in the September issues of Vogue,
W and Vanity Fair, and spreads will run in the New York Times
Magazine, Harper's Bazaar, Wallpaper and V. Ads will also appear in
the October issue of Details.
 &HT;    
 SPARKLING DONATION  
 &HT;    Because Elizabeth Taylor was recently proclaimed a Dame of the
British Empire, her fragrance licensee, Elizabeth Arden, is
celebrating by making a donation to her AIDS foundation.
 &HT;    Through August, the company will donate a portion of the
proceeds from sales of Elizabeth Taylor Sparkling White Diamonds.
 &HT;    ``We wanted to honor Dame Elizabeth with a meaningful gift,''
said Susan Taylor, managing director, Elizabeth Arden, U.K. ``We
believe we will be able to donate a substantial sum by the end of
the summer.''
 &HT;    Elizabeth Taylor Sparkling White Diamonds, which launched in the
United States last year, is now available at the 90 branches of
Debenhams throughout the United Kingdom.
 &HT;    
 Golden Greek  
 &HT;    Several biographers have tried in vain to figure out Stavros
Niarchos, the Greek shipping tycoon who died in 1996. But an
upcoming memoir by John Frangoulis, the longtime captain of
Niarchos' yacht, the Creole, should shed more light on the
reclusive billionnaire.
 &HT;    Frangoulis details many of Niarchos' eccentric habits, including
his insistence that his favorite van Goghs be on board the boat
whenever he was _ never mind that they'd be ruined by the sea air.
 &HT;    Then there was Niarchos' habit of swimming nude while an armed
guard stood on deck, checking for sharks.
 &HT;    The book, due out later this year in Europe, also has photos of
the Creole's many illustrious guests _ including the Duchess of
Windsor, who clearly wasn't the type to pack light. For one brief
stay on the boat, she showed up with 12 Vuitton steamer trunks.
 &HT;    
 MANHATTAN TRANSFER  
 &HT;    One of Los Angeles' reigning nightlife impresarios, Sean
MacPherson, is heading to New York.
 &HT;    The man behind such haunts as Smalls, the Olive, Swingers and
Bar Marmont plans to open his first New York restaurant next year
at an unspecified downtown location.
 &HT;    To help him navigate the local terrain, he'll be partnering with
Eric Goode of Bowery Bar fame.
 &HT;    ``I have a good feeling about this one,'' MacPherson says.
 &HT;    
 ROYAL BABES  
 &HT;    Prince William isn't the only pinup in the British royal family.
In the past few months, two of William's female cousins have been
setting male teens' hearts aflutter with their blond looks and
trendy fashion sense.
 &HT;    Gabriella Windsor, the 19-year-old daughter of Prince and
Princess Michael of Kent, had the British tabloids panting when she
appeared at the Badminton Horse Trials in a tight-fitting sweater
and leather Stetson. (Windsor's good looks are shared by her
brother Frederick, a model featured in the latest Burberry
campaign.)
 &HT;    Meanwhile, royal rebel Zara Phillips, 18, delighted the
paparazzi at a recent horse race by wearing a chic jacket and
thigh-high skirt.
 &HT;    Phillips, the daughter of the Princess Royal and Mark Phillips,
is dating jockey Richard Johnson; she has agreed to remove her
tongue stud in exchange for his vow to give up smoking.
 &HT;    
 FIELD DAY  
 &HT;    It's no secret that Hollywood movie stars have been earning
extra cash by appearing in ads on Italian TV: Harrison Ford has
plugged Fiat, Catherine Zeta-Jones has campaigned for Alfa Romeo
and even Brad Pitt has deigned to promote Damiani jewelry, secure
in the knowledge that the commercials would never be shown
Stateside.
 &HT;    But Kevin Costner has reportedly broken a longstanding taboo by
allowing his upcoming shoe commercial to appear in the United
States.
 &HT;    In fact, the new ad, for the mid-range Italian shoe company
Valleverde, will reportedly debut in America this fall and air
later in Europe. The commercial shows Costner walking in a field,
helping a child take its first steps.
 &HT;    
 FETISH SCENT RELAUNCHED  
 &HT;    NEW ORLEANS _ Grammy-award-winning singer Christina Aguilera is
expanding her range with a line of color cosmetics.
 &HT;    The 19-year-old international pop star is partnering with the
Boca Raton, Fla.-based New Dana Perfumes Company on a relaunch of
its teen brand Fetish.
 &HT;    The collection, expected to rollout in January, has been renamed
Fetish by Christina Aguilera. Packaging will carry the slogan
``What a Girl Wants,'' after her hit single.
 &HT;    Aguilera snagged the Grammys' ``Best New Artist'' award earlier
this year and also appeared in the Super Bowl half-time show with
Enrique Iglesias.
 &HT;    Aguilera also has promotional contracts with Levi's and recently
inked a deal with Coca Cola. With Fetish, however, she is directly
involved in product design and packaging.
 &HT;    ``I am definitely going to have a say in the products,''
Aguilera said. She has already swapped the brand's lavender
packaging for black with silver components. ``I've always been a
lover of fashion, and I enjoy playing with makeup.''
 &HT;    This time last year, as part of the Renaissance Cosmetics
Company, Fetish was in Chapter 11. p

 (Three color slides) 
 From W magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Giorgio Armani is justly celebrated for his sleek, feminine and
sophisticated style. He got Hollywood hooked on Armani, and many
loyalists, such as Michelle Pfeiffer and Jodie Foster, wear his
clothes around the clock.
 &HT;    So it isn't surprising that, in a season when accessories are in
the forefront of fashion, the designer is relaunching a terrific
collection of handbags, shoes and small leather goods.
 &HT;    ``It's a very exciting time in fashion, and accessories are a
part of that,'' Armani says. ``People are looking for ways to make
a fashion statement, not a loud, in-your-face statement, but one
that suggests their personalities and styles. Accessories are
decorative. They enhance a wardrobe, but they never become the
wardrobe.''
 &HT;    The collection consists of cleanlined pieces, many in vibrant
shades and exotic skins.
 &HT;    ``Color is wonderful,'' the designer says. ``And exotic skins
add texture and patterns, making beautiful accents for my
clothes.''
 &HT;    According to Judith Collinson, executive vice-president of
Barneys New York, ``This line is very cohesive. There is a creative
energy throughout. There's also a retro feeling to some of the
handbag designs, which is new.''
 &HT;    The looks, which Kal Ruttenstein, senior vice-president for
fashion direction at Bloomingdale's, describes as ``strong, sexy,
up-to-date and exciting,'' range from elongated python clutches in
wild colors like fuchsia and orange to bare stiletto lizard sandals
in a pale mint hue.
 &HT;    There are also more ladylike offerings: small structured
top-handle bags in ostrich and alligator or lizard mid-heel pumps,
along with colored beaded handbags and shoes for evening that
perfectly complement the designer's drop-dead eveningwear.

 SOAP STARS  
 &HT;    It has been in business since 1695, so it's pretty safe to say
that French soap and fragrance maker Roger &AMP; Gallet knows a lot
about the art of making soap.
 &HT;    Its newest products, Gardener's Special Soaps, come in such
flavors as Cherry Tomato, Lettuce and Carrot; they contain actual
vegetable extracts and smell good enough to bathe in. Available at
Henri Bendel, Nordstrom, Bloomingdale's and Marshall Fields.
 &HT;    
 MRS. FROSTY  
 &HT;    In the thick of summer, just the idea of wearing makeup can make
anyone break into a sweat. To the rescue: Aveda's new Cooling
Calming Cover Sheer Face Tint (a foundation) and Aveda Cooling
Calming Color Eye/Cheek Tint (a blush).
 &HT;    They not only keep you polished but also promise to lower body
temperature by five degrees _ thanks to formulas that contain
almost 50 percent water. And when the heat's on, this is definitely
a good thing. Aveda, (800) 283-3224.
 &HT;    
 WILD CARD  
 &HT;    With her first foray into makeup, Iman _ the Somalian
supermodel, mother-to-be and wife of David Bowie _ proved that she
knew how to do basic, wearable makeup. Now, with her creation of
I-Iman Makeup, she's showing the world her uninhibited side.
 &HT;    For this collection, Iman has unleashed a few tricks of her
trade, such as I-Matte, a gel spray that instantly seals makeup,
and I-Shimmer, an iridescent powder with glorious shine in a
rainbow of shades. Exclusively at Sephora.
 &HT;    
 CRYSTAL LIGHT  
 &HT;    When mineral makeup was first introduced a few years ago, it was
dismissed as a quirky trend.
 &HT;    Francie Willis, the owner of the Urban Retreat Day Spa in
Houston, is setting out to change that with Franche, her extensive
collection of water-resistant mineral makeup with freeze-dried
vitamins.
 &HT;    Particularly appealing is Lip Luscious, an iridescent gloss made
from plant-derived liquid crystals. Available at Henri Bendel and
at (877) 372-4243. c.2000 Fairchild Publications

LINDA BITES BACK: SUES CALVIN FOR $500 MILLION

 &HT;    
 By VICKI M. YOUNG 
 From DNR 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ Judicial resolution of the nasty brawl between Calvin
Klein Inc. and The Warnaco Group Inc. can be reduced to just one
key central issue: Did CKI's biggest licensee have any rights to
sell CK trademarked products to off-price membership clubs?
 &HT;    On June 26, Linda Wachner's Warnaco Group filed a countersuit in
Manhattan federal court against Calvin Klein Inc. seeking $500
million in damages, charging Klein with an ongoing and intentional
breach of its obligations to Warnaco, under several licensing
agreements.
 &HT;    Warnaco is suing both CKI and Calvin Klein, personally, for
defamation and trade libel, seeking at least $50 million in
compensatory and punitive damages.
 &HT;    The libel and defamation claims arise from the designer's June 5
appearance on ``Larry King Live.'' The suit says that during the
Larry King show, Klein attacked ``the quality of the (jeanswear)
product'' produced by CKI, asserting that it had been
``compromised'' and announced that ``we want our license back, and
we want it to be in the hands of a responsible manufacturing
company.''
 &HT;    CKI, in its original lawsuit, claimed that Warnaco was eroding
the Calvin Klein jeanswear and underwear lines through a flood of
discounting and other unauthorized sales and practices ``that are
the equivalent of counterfeiting.''
 &HT;    Warnaco, however, claimed in the court filing that CKI has no
right under any agreement with Warnaco to approve channels of
distribution, and that Warnaco has every right to sell Calvin Klein
jeanswear through its distribution channels.
 &HT;    ``CKI and Warnaco agreed that each would utilize distribution
outlets that were consistent 'with the reputation and prestige of
the trademarks.' In fact, CKI expressly reserved the right for it
or any of its licensees to sell Calvin Klein trademarked
products... 'in the mass merchandise market and channels of
distribution.' Warnaco expressly reserved the right to sell certain
Calvin Klein trademarked underwear in the mass merchandise
market.''
 &HT;    According to Warnaco, the warehouse membership clubs such as
Costco sell high-end fashion and accessories designs by Prada,
Gucci, DKNY, Cartier, Movado, among others.
 &HT;    In fact, Warnaco's answer to the CKI lawsuit contains 18 pages
showing the breadth of products being sold on Costo.com, including
those by Coach, Prada, Gucci Rush, Tag Heuer, Movado, Chanel, DKNY,
Tommy Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren, in addition to Calvin Klein Jeans,
cK1, Eternity by Calvin Klein and Escape by Calvin Klein.
 &HT;    The firm also said that these stores also sell and continue to
sell an array of CK-branded products made and distributed by other
licensees.
 &HT;    Warnaco is seeking a declaratory judgment to confirm those
licensees' rights to distribute CK product in the membership clubs.
 &HT;    A spokesman for CKI said, ``As the CKI complaint lays out, the
company believes that product was sold to a number of unauthorized
channels and the company believes that the evidence will show that
Warnaco knew it was unauthorized.''
 &HT;    In the original May 30 complaint by CKI, the company charged
that except for a one-time deal in which Warnaco was given the okay
to sell at a membership club to clean up inherited problems in the
distribution channel, ``since 1997, CKI has never approved Costco,
BJ's or Sam's Club as appropriate channels of regular distribution
for close-outs, seconds, or irregulars of Calvin Klein goods _ much
less sales of first-quality goods.''
 &HT;    Also in the Warnaco countersuit, the company charged that a
proposed sale on June 8, 2000, of almost $400,000 of CK jeanswear
to Mode Shirmax Fashions, a Canadian retail chain, fell through
``specifically because of statements'' made by the designer during
the Larry King interview.
 &HT;    Shirmax, Warnaco said, had projected that it would order $1.15
million in jeanswear in 2001. Another customer in Venezuela,
Warnaco said in the suit, ``reduced its order for Calvin Klein
jeanswear from $1.5 million to $500,000.''
 &HT;    The suit also charges CKI and the designer with timing the
filing of its lawsuit to coincide with a speech he gave last month
at the Fairchild CEO Summit, a gathering of fashion industry and
press planned months in advance, where, the suit claims, he
``falsely accused'' Warnaco of counterfeiting CKI apparel.
 &HT;    And, in an apparent attempt to show that CKI officials had no
prior problems with Warnaco's distribution practices _ a key
complaint and a major focus of CKI's own suit against Warnaco _ a
Warnaco press release describes a letter that Klein and his
partner, Barry Schwartz, wrote to Warnaco Oct. 6, 1999, thanking
Warnaco for its ``efforts to make our projects with you so
successful and to ask for your continued support as we move on to
the next level of creativity, productivity and rewards.'' The
letter was referring to the strategic options CKI was about to
explore in its attempt to sell or find a partner.
 &HT;    In response, CKI issued a statement saying: ``Warnaco's
announcement is a thinly veiled attempt to divert attention from
the fact that Warnaco has been systematically violating its
agreements with Calvin Klein Inc. In fact, the letter Warnaco
distributed today to substantiate its claims of support for its
activities by Calvin Klein was a courtesy form letter sent to
dozens of people on the same day last fall announcing Calvin Klein
Inc.'s exploration of strategic options _ a weak reed, indeed, on
which to base a counterclaim.''
 &HT;    The legal jab arises from the May 30 lawsuit filed by CKI and
the Calvin Klein Trademark Trust against it biggest licensee,
Warnaco, and Wachner. Warnaco and CKI are co-owners of the Calvin
Klein Trademark Trust, which owns the Calvin Klein marks.
 &HT;    The main thrust of the CKI suit _ which alleges federal
trademark violations and breach of fiduciary duty and contracts _
centers on CKI's allegations that Warnaco infringed upon and
diluted the Calvin Klein underwear and jeanswear trademarks in the
U.S. by selling unauthorized CKI goods to off-price warehouse
clubs, such as Costco, Sam's Club and BJ's Wholesale.
 &HT;    And the battle apparently is raging outside the courthouse, as
well. According to sources, CKI is trying to stop a multimillion
dollar order that Costco placed with Warnaco this spring. The
Calvin Klein Jeans order is reportedly about to go into production.
 &HT;    Warnaco also disclosed that it and CKI reached a tentative
agreement in April on a $900 million purchase price for the
company, but that Warnaco withdrew because of disagreements over
the scope of the acquisition agreement.
 &HT;    Since then, Warnaco charged, ``Mr. Klein and CKI embarked on the
inconsistent and self-destructive strategy of attacking The Warnaco
Group _ the very same entity that had once saved them from
financial ruin and now provides them in excess of $85 million
annually.''
 &HT;    The Calvin Klein jeans and underwear business under Warnaco's
umbrella represent about $1 billion in sales. Last year the
jeanswear license generated revenues just under $700 million.

 (Color slides and B&AMP;W map available.) 
 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By LARRY ROHTER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Superlatives come quickly to mind when talking about Sao Paulo.
With 18 million people in its metropolitan area, this is the
largest city in Brazil, the largest in South America, indeed the
largest in the Southern Hemisphere.
 &HT;    It boasts of having the largest population of Japanese descent
of any city outside Japan, the largest of Lebanese descent of any
city outside the Middle East, the largest of Italian descent of any
city outside Italy, and more wealth than any city in what used to
be called the third world.
 &HT;    Paulistanos, as residents of the city are known, have always
taken pride in the cosmopolitan environment they have constructed
around them during the past century, but rarely more so than now.
 &HT;    All year long, Brazil is marking the 500th anniversary of the
arrival of the first Portuguese expedition to the New World, and
Sao Paulo, with a melting-pot population that personifies the
Brazilian ideal of racial democracy, is a focal point of the
commemorations.
 &HT;    Those who come to Sao Paulo expecting to find a laid-back
seaside tropical resort in the style of Rio de Janeiro or Salvador
are in for a shock. Sao Paulo is a very different kind of Brazil:
aggressive, sprawling and resourceful, with a different climate,
including temperatures that can drop to near-freezing at night
during the Southern Hemisphere winter (June through September).
 &HT;    Instead, Sao Paulo's charms are distinctly urban: restaurants,
museums, concerts, nightclubs, parks and window shopping along
Avenida Paulista, the main commercial boulevard. So are the
problems the city confronts, including poverty, crime and police
brutality. But even a confirmed Tropicalist like the pop singer
Caetano Veloso was forced to confess that, as he wrote in a homage
to the busiest intersection in Brazil's busiest city, ``Something
happens in my heart every time I turn the corner of Ipiranga and
Sao Joao.''
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    The magnificent exhibition known as ``Brazil+500'' is the
largest show of Brazilian art ever assembled, spread over an area
larger than the Louvre in four separate buildings. With some 15,000
pieces on display, it is hard to talk about highlights, but the
sections focusing on Indian, folk and Afro-Brazilian art have drawn
especially lavish praise from local and international critics.
Admission is $5.75 on weekdays and $8.50 on weekends, at 1.8 real
to the dollar. Telephone (55-11) 573-6073. Until Sept. 7 at
Ibirapuera Park.
 &HT;    To mark the 500th anniversary of the Portuguese arrival, leading
Brazilian and Portuguese pop musicians are offering a monthly
series of free joint concerts at Ibirapuera Park. On July 30,
Gilberto Gil, Maria Joao and Mario Laginha will perform together,
with Ney Matogrosso and Marta Dias scheduled for Aug. 13 and Gal
Costa and Madredeus closing the series on Sept. 9.
 &HT;    Sao Paulo has numerous music halls featuring Brazil's top
artists, with performance schedules published in newspapers and
monthly English-language tourist guides. One winter highlight
promises to be a number of shows by the brilliant pop singer Marisa
Monte at the Palace, Avenida dos Jamaris 213 in Moema. She will be
performing weekends from July 27 through Sept. 9, with tickets $10
and up; (55-11) 5643-2569.
 &HT;    No rivalry in international soccer is more intense than that
between Brazil, which has captured the World Cup four times, and
Argentina, which has won it twice. The national teams of the two
countries will play each other on July 26 at the 80,000-seat
Morumbi Stadium, Sao Paulo's largest, at Praca Roberto Gomes
Pedrosa 1, Jardim Leonor, as part of the qualifying round for the
2002 World Cup. Call (55-11) 3749-8000 for information about
tickets (prices to be announced shortly before the match).
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    Ibirapuera Park is to Sao Paulo what Central Park is to New York
City: an island of green and calm amid traffic and skyscrapers. It
has numerous museums and pavilions, many of them designed by the
renowned Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer, and open spaces that
include lakes and playgrounds, which draw large crowds of families
on weekends. The planetarium, $2.85, is especially interesting
because it displays the constellations of the Southern Hemisphere.
The park is open daily, 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.; (55-11) 574-5177.
 &HT;    Exhibitions in which venom is extracted from snakes are no
longer offered to the public, but the Instituto Butantan, Avenida
Vital Brasil 1500 in the Butanta area, remains perhaps the city's
most popular tourist attraction.
 &HT;    One of the world's leading reptile research centers, it has a
collection of more than 60,000 animals, and its small museum
features live spiders and scorpions as well as poisonous snakes
with exotic names like jararaca and mussurana. Open Tuesday through
Sunday, 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Admission is 85 cents; 55 cents for
children; (55-11) 813-7222.
 &HT;    The Memorial to the Immigrant, at Rua Visconde de Parnaiba 1316
in Bras, is the Brazilian equivalent of Ellis Island. Nearly three
million people from 60 different countries, including the United
States, came through this processing center during the 91 years it
operated before closing in 1978, and their contributions to
Brazilian society are honored in thorough, fascinating exhibits in
a somewhat nondescript complex of brick buildings done in
neo-Classical style. Open Tuesday through Sunday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Admission $1.15, half price for children; (55-11) 6693-0917.
 &HT;    Installed in one of the city's uglier buildings is its best
museum, known as the MASP, or Museu de Arte de Sao Paulo. The
collection here is said to be the largest and most impressive in
Latin America, with European masters like Rembrandt, van Gogh,
Goya, El Greco and Monet as well as leading Brazilian artists such
as Portinari, Anita Malfatti and Tarsila do Amaral. On Sunday an
antiques and arts and crafts fair is held on the square outside the
museum. Open Tuesday through Sunday, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; admission
$5.75. Avenida Paulista 1578; (55-11) 251-5644.
 &HT;    Also on Sundays, the ``Discover Sao Paulo'' program offers three
bus tours departing from the Praca da Republica downtown. The Green
route shows visitors parks and gardens, the Cultural itinerary
visits the principal museums, and the Historic tour stops at old
homes and monuments. Tickets _ $2.85; $1.15 for children _ are sold
at tourist offices or through (55-11) 6971-5000.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    By Brazilian standards, Sao Paulo hotels can be absurdly
overpriced. Rates mimic those of New York, with service and
amenities that cost half as much in Rio de Janeiro or Salvador. But
on weekends, when business travelers leave, rates at major hotels
can drop by 30 percent.
 &HT;    Few of Sao Paulo's hotels are more reliable or convenient than
the Crowne Plaza, just off Avenida Paulista at Rua Frei Caneca 1360
in Cerqueira Cesar. Remodeled not long ago, it has 220 rooms and
large beds and bathtubs in which to sink at the end of a long day.
A standard double starts at $198 a night through the chain's
``Summer Options'' program. Telephone (55-11) 253-2244 or (800)
227-6963; fax (55-11) 251-3121.
 &HT;    In the 1970s, the Grand Hotel Ca D'Oro, Rua Augusta 129 in
Consolacao, was the most elegant place to stay in Sao Paulo. The
neighborhood has fallen on hard times, but the 265 rooms, most
still decorated in the same style as they were back then, are
large, and the Italian restaurant on the ground floor is one of the
best in town. Doubles are $150, breakfast included; (55-11)
236-4300, fax (55-11) 236-4311.
 &HT;    Budget: Sao Paulo is awash in what are known as ``flats,''
apartment hotels aimed primarily at the long-term business visitor
but also available to the tourist. One especially good option is
the Parthenon chain, which operates a score of these residential
hotels. Rooms at some, such as the Parthenon St. Germain on Rua
Padre Joao Manuel 202 in Cerqueira Cesar, start at $60, with
breakfast. The top price at this chain is $100. Call (800) 111790
for reservations; fax (55-11) 883-2476.
 &HT;    The Best Western Porto do Sol, Rua Tutoia 77 in Cerqueira Cesar,
is halfway between Avenida Paulista and Ibirapuera Park and
convenient to many good restaurants. Its 198 rooms, while simple,
are as clean and attractive as those of its much more expensive
neighbors. A double starts at $100, with an ample breakfast buffet
of tropical fruits and juices; (55-11) 3059-5000, fax (55-11)
3059-5193.
 &HT;    Luxury: Big, swaggering, always crowded and boasting such
curiosities as a restaurant specializing in Danish cuisine, the
Maksoud Plaza Hotel, Alameda Campinas 150 in Bela Vista, has become
something of a landmark since it opened 20 years ago. But the
imposing atrium and 415 rooms are starting to show their age, and
there is a certain air of snobbery that can be disconcerting.
Doubles from $350; (55-11) 253-4411, fax (55-11) 253-4544.
 &HT;    On the other side of Avenida Paulista, at Alameda Santos 1123,
sits the Inter-Continental Sao Paulo. The 193 rooms here are larger
than those at several other luxury hotels, the atmosphere is one of
cool efficiency, and there are many good places to eat within
walking distance. Doubles are normally $400, but some are available
through Sept. 15 at the ``Summer Options'' price of $200. Telephone
(55-11) 3179-2600 or (800) 327-0200; fax (55-11) 3179-2669.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    Year after year, Baby-Beef Rubaiyat is the runaway winner in
every survey of Sao Paulo's best churrascarias, restaurants
specializing in grilled meat. The cuts may seem unfamiliar to the
American palate, but the meat here is extraordinarily tender and
lean, perhaps because the restaurant has its own ranch where it
raises cattle, hogs, sheep and chicken. Of the two branches, the
more convenient is at Alameda Santos 86 in Paraiso. Dinner for two
with beer, about $65; (55-11) 289-6366.
 &HT;    In theory, Antiquarius, Alameda Lorena 1884 in Cerqueira Cesar,
specializes solely in Portuguese cuisine. But one of its signature
dishes is a singular mixture of Lusitanian and Brazilian
ingredients: a startlingly delicate codfish moqueca, or stew, laced
with coconut milk. The atmosphere is charmingly rustic. Dinner for
two with a bottle of sparkling Portuguese vinho verde: about $125;
(55-11) 282-3015
 &HT;    The menu at Amadeus, Rua Haddock Lobo 807 in Cerqueira Cesar, is
devoted to seafood in all its forms, freshly caught just off the
coast less than 50 miles away. Traditional Brazilian sauces, which
make liberal use of coconut milk, palm oil, onions, tomato and
peppers, are the main feature, but a terrific shrimp curry is also
on the menu. Dinner for two with a bottle of Brazilian wine is
about $110; (55-11) 3061-2859.
 &HT;    In a city blessed with dozens of excellent Italian restaurants
and cantinas, Massimo, at Alameda Santos 1826 in Cerqueira Cesar,
stands at the head of the class. The osso buco is so tender it
almost melts off the bone, and the cheeses, eggplant, peppers and
olives used in the antipasto are extraordinarily fresh. Dinner for
two is about $125 (no credit cards accepted); (55-11) 284-3011.
 &HT;    For cheap, appetizing eating, Paulistanos often turn to
restaurants offering food by the kilogram, most of which charge
$4.50 to $5.50 a pound. There is a large concentration of these
self-service buffet-style cafeterias in Rua Augusta. One that
stands out for its varied menu and mouth-watering desserts is the
Parque Avenida Grill, Avenida Paulista 1776; (55-11) 283-0201.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By NICOLE KRAUSS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The first time I was in the Peloponnesus, it was midwinter, and
out of the low fog that was everywhere goatherds seemed to appear
and dissolve as if in a Theo Angelopoulos film. The narrow roads
etched into the mountainside threatened to fall off into clouds.
 &HT;    At every switchback turn, a small, mailbox-like shrine with
faded icon, biscuits and half-empty bottle of Fanta seemed placed
to ensure safe passage.
 &HT;    Despite the cool air, the orange groves along the roadside were
fragrant, and as I walked between the rows of trees, the silence
was punctuated by the thud of ripe oranges dropping. The
archaeological sites _ and often it seemed the peninsula itself _
were empty of people.
 &HT;    Aside from the phantom goatherds and the men in the kafeneia
smoking and fingering their knotted worry beads, the most evident
signs of life were the occasional smoldering heaps of rubbish that
slid down the mountainside like scree.
 &HT;    In that strange weather there was something almost threatening
about the loom and lunge of the mountains. Alone among the ruins of
Olympia or Epidaurus, I couldn't shake a feeling of eerieness and
half expected, at any moment, to encounter some ancient shade
walking among the broken columns.
 &HT;    It's no surprise that at times the Peloponnesus seems haunted.
The Isle of Pelops is named for the boy slaughtered and cooked by
his father, Tantalus, and served to the gods. Brought back to life
by the outraged Zeus, Pelops eventually became a king.
 &HT;    Later a curse was put on him by a man he tricked, so that for
generations the House of Pelops was plagued by murders and
vendettas, by the same grisly plots compulsively repeated.
 &HT;    But in spring the Peloponnesus changes. It is as if the curse
lifts with the fog and the valleys and hillsides suddenly flower.
With 6,000 species of flowering plants, Greece has some of the most
extensive flora of any European country. The fields fill with
larkspur, anemones and asphodel, with stalks of giant fennel in
whose slow-burning pith Prometheus brought fire to the Earth. Pink
and white oleanders hem the roads, and house fronts are decorated
with shocks of bougainvillea.
 &HT;    But despite the abundance of flowers and the bright sun, much of
the Peloponnesus retains a kind of severity year-round: even in
that fabled idyll, Arcadia, the barren mountain peaks are always
present. The occasional monasteries built into sheer cliff faces
remind the traveler of the isolation of the place.
 &HT;    This time I returned to the Peloponnesus in June, to rent a
house with a friend on the beach with no address or phone. Aside
from this, its most remarkable detail was the blowzy red lampshade
that hung, with its delusions of grandeur, over the kitchen table.
Everything else about the house was simple and rustic.
 &HT;    Its only luxury was the garden, so packed with oleanders, lemon,
fig and pomegranate trees that it threatened to engulf the cottage
in its green embrace. In Greece it is impossible to forget that
everything must eventually fall to ruin; what little remains
depends on freak chance or the serendipity of archaeologists.
 &HT;    Behind the garden walls that backed up onto a grove of
lime-washed olive trees, Ben and I spent whole days reading.
Clothes became mostly useless. Even as we read about ancient
Greece, civilization seemed to stall or slip a notch.
 &HT;    We told time by the constantly changing light or the sounds
around us: the clatter of cicadas or the bells from the small
church where the priest sang his drafty evensong, the doors on all
sides of the cruciform church thrown open to his congregation of
zero. Only in the evenings, when the stubborn heat finally began to
give in, would we venture out to swim in the clear Ionian Sea.
 &HT;    Our house was on the western coast of the Mani, the middle of
the three southern switchblades of land that jut into the sea. It
was partly Patrick Leigh Fermor's exhaustive book ``Mani,''
published in the 1950s, that originally drew us to the place; the
house we rented outside the little town of Stoupa was only a few
miles away from his.
 &HT;    Mr. Fermor describes the map of the southern part of the
Peloponnesus as ``a misshapen tooth fresh torn from its gum with
three peninsulas jutting southward in jagged and carious roots.''
The middle carious root _ a description that conjures not only its
shape but also its character _ is the Mani.
 &HT;    The sharp spine of the Taygetos mountain range rips down its
length, and on its hard, boulder-strewn plateaus a fierce and
passionate race of people lived in a perpetual state of war.
 &HT;    Descended from Spartans, Slavs, and Frankish crusaders, the
Maniots' way of life revolved around bloody family feuds waged with
yataghans (short Turkish sabers with double-curved blades), axes
and muskets; when a feud was on a Maniot could not leave his house
without dodging a volley of bullets.
 &HT;    The Maniots lived in austere stone tower houses, the better to
aim at and pick off a neighbor. They were feared by other Greeks,
many of whom still keep a wide berth of the peninsula. Not much
remains of the Maniots now, having killed off or tired each other
out, and their surviving progeny packed up and moved to Athens. The
wrecks of their domestic fortresses _ sometimes whole villages of
them _ seem outcroppings of the very rock that forms the wild and
lonely hills.
 &HT;    On weekends we explored the Peloponnesus _ often on overnight
trips _ in a car we rented in Stoupa, the town where Kazantzakis
created the larger-than-life character Zorba. On our first
excursion we headed south, deep into the Mani. We stopped for an
early breakfast at the Krifos Kipos taverna in the tiny fishing
village of Agios Nikolaos and watched the caiques come in, hung
with kerosene lanterns and laden with the morning's catch of fish.
 &HT;    The serenity was only occasionally punctured by cries of the
ubiquitous traveling salesmen who advertise their wares, whether
watermelons or plastic chairs, from megaphones mounted on the roofs
of their trucks.
 &HT;    After Agios Nikolaos the road climbs inland into the mountains
before cutting back to the coast to descend on the Bay of Limeni,
where the white-capped sea bites deeply into the cliffs. In the
Maniot town of Areopolis (named, appropriately, for the god of war)
the cobbled streets are lined with tower houses whose whitewashed
rooms look out onto slopes of prickly pear.
 &HT;    Nearby are the caves of Pirgos Dirou where, for less than the
mythical gold coin, a gruff Charon punted us on a skiff through the
miles of stalactite-hung grottoes said to extend inland as far as
Sparta.
 &HT;    After Areopolis the Mani becomes more desolate; this stretch of
the Taygetos is dubbed the Kakovounia, or Evil Mountains. In
summer, the temperature rises until it reaches the sort of heat
that breeds hallucinations or madness. Nothing much grows there
except for scrub or scorched grass, yet it is tremendously
beautiful.
 &HT;    At the highest points clusters of tower houses still stand vigil
above the sea. And everywhere the ruins of stout stone walls
criss-cross the plateaus: surreal boundaries that mark one share of
nothingness from the next. We passed a dust-covered mason breaking
stones by the roadside in the noonday sun, but he spoke no English
and we spoke little Greek and so we couldn't extract from him the
reason for that infinite network of senseless walls. But he happily
posed for a picture.
 &HT;    After the ghost town of Vatheia _ whose tower houses have been
converted into an eccentric hotel _ the peninsula narrows toward
its end, Cape Tainaron, the location of the mythical gates to the
Underworld. The beaches widen (Marmari is one of the most
beautiful) and the sea, surprisingly warm, breaks in tremendous
waves. By the time we arrived at the very tip of the cape it was
already evening.
 &HT;    Around the ruins of the Temple of Poseidon the wind bent the
gold grass toward the sea; directly above us the sky was stamped by
the first sliver of moon. Somewhere nearby was the cave where
Hercules supposedly descended to the Underworld to bring back the
three-headed dog, Cerberus. But we stopped short of finding it,
feeling some things are better left to the imagination.
 &HT;    The Peloponnesus has some of the finest classical ruins in the
world. The acoustics in the amphitheater of Epidaurus _ one of the
greatest sites _ are so perfect that even from the uppermost tier a
whisper from the stage is audible.
 &HT;    When I brushed my foot along the circle that marks center stage
a twang rang out as from an amplified steel guitar. Behind the
theater are the vast ruins of the spa where invalids came from all
over the Hellenic world to convalesce with the aid of therapeutic
baths, poultices and miraculous cures.
 &HT;    In the mountains of Arcadia, up a winding road of treacherous
hairpin turns, is the limestone Temple of Bassae, erected around
420 B.C. _ in the middle of nowhere _ by Ictinus, the architect of
the Parthenon. In Pylos, in the remains of Nestor's Palace, you can
stand in what's left of the great hall where Telemachus came to ask
for news of his father. The most remarkable surviving detail of the
ruins is an intact terra-cotta tub, last bathed in some 3,000 years
ago.
 &HT;    In the northeast region of the Peloponnesus is Mycenae, first
excavated in the 19th century by Heinrich Schliemann, the
indigo-merchant-turned-archaeologist who discovered Troy. Upon
opening the most elaborate of the royal tombs, he wrote to the King
of Greece, ``I have stared into the face of Agamemnon.''
 &HT;    From 1400 to 1200 B.C. Mycenae was the most powerful kingdom in
Greece. In the rooms of the ruined palace there, Clytemnestra and
her lover, Aegisthus, murdered her husband in a bath to avenge the
sacrifice of her daughter; her children Orestes and Electra, in
turn, murdered Clytemnestra.
 &HT;    To me, the most moving ancient site in the Peloponnesus is
Olympia. The first time I was there it was February and raining,
and I was alone in the place. It made such an impression on me
that, as the summer was running out, I insisted on a last trip to
see it again. Every four years, for almost 1,200 years, athletes
made a pilgrimage to this quiet grove of pines to strive to achieve
the heights of human strength, grace, speed and agility.
 &HT;    Although the hippodrome has long since sunk into the silt of the
Alfios River, the temples and most of the buildings remain, as does
the short-distance track. It is around 600 feet long, with hills
for specta tors on either side and stone slabs cut with grooves
where the runners crouched before the start signal. No one else was
around when we were there so we took our sandals off and raced each
other barefoot, neck and neck, pounding the ground packed down by
time and countless ancient races.
 &HT;    But history did not end on the Peloponnesus with the fall of
Greece. The landscape is scattered with signs of all who followed
the invasion of the Romans: Goths, Avars and Slavs, the Byzantines,
Franks, Turks and Venetians. After the perfection of Praxiteles'
sculptures or still-extant geometry of a Grecian temple, these
medieval ruins may seem crude and insubstantial.
 &HT;    But atop the rock of Monemvasia, inside the 13th-century
Byzantine church with its humbled frescoes, one suddenly feels the
illumination of those dark ages, sensing the very pattern of
history itself with its endlessly repeating eras of chaos and
order.
 &HT;    And even as one is constantly aware of all that has been lost,
there are also reminders of what is continuous: the
thousand-year-old monastery of St. John the Baptist outside the
mountain town of Stemnitsa, for example, where the monks waved down
to us from their hawk's perch to offer us coffee and a bowl of
Turkish de light.
 &HT;    At the end of each of our weekend excursions _ to the southern
tip of the Mani, to Monemvasia, Olympia, Arcadia _ we found
ourselves eager to return to our small house. After such a close
study of the ravages of time, there is a certain comfort in a place
where nothing seems to happen.
 &HT;    The day's only events were the start or finish of a book, the
evening baptism in the Ionian, and our meals at the house or our
favorite taverna, Agrogiali, usually accompanied by a carafe of
retsina, the local wine made with pine resin.
 &HT;    Under the influence of that good drink, with the sun gone down
leaving the houses glowing like lamps, a poem by Constantine Cavafy
came to mind.
 &HT;    ``That we've broken their statues,/that we've driven them out of
their temples,/doesn't mean at all that the gods are dead.'' The
poem ends with an ethereal figure in rapid flight, winging across
the hills: a further explanation, perhaps, for the occasional
ghostliness of the place.
 &HT;    -----
 SIDEBAR: IN A LAND HAUNTED BY A LONG HISTORY  
 LOGISTICS  
 &HT;    The airport at Kalamata, around 30 miles from Stoupa, has
flights from Athens on Olympic Airways. Travelers can also fly into
Athens, then take a bus or rent a car. There are frequent (if
rickety) buses to all major towns. A hydrofoil connects Piraeus and
Monemvasia.
 &HT;    Some of the classical sites in the Peloponnesus can be reached
on a day trip from the Mani, but an overnight stay is needed for
Epidaurus and Mycenae.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    The Peloponnesus is largely untouched by tourism, which means
there are almost no luxury hotels. Renting a house is probably the
best option. We found ours advertised in The New York Review of
Books.
 &HT;    There are also a number of small, charming and relatively
inexpensive inns. The Thomeas Travel Agency in Stoupa, (30-721)
77689; fax (30-721) 77571, can help with accommodations. A studio
for two people with bath and cooking facilities runs about $42 a
day in high season (July through September); a two-bedroom villa,
around $70 (at 360 drachmas to the dollar). Ask for Bob Barrow, an
English expatriate who published his own book about the Mani.
 &HT;    In the Mani, Limeni Village, near Areopolis, (30-733) 51111, fax
(30-733) 51182, perched on a cliff overlooking Limeni Bay, has
spectacular views. Its 35 rooms are in replicas of tower houses; a
restaurant with a terrace overlooks the sea. There is also a
swimming pool. Doubles cost $64 in July and August, with buffet
breakfast, $50 the rest of the year.
 &HT;    In Vatheia there are lodgings in restored ruins of tower houses
atop a rocky escarpment, with sweeping views down to the ocean.
Information: (30-733) 55244. A double is $44 in summer, $39 in
winter.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    Lela's Taverna in Kardamyli, (30-721) 73541, is run by a
wonderful woman (and an excellent cook) who used to be the
housekeeper for Patrick Leigh Fermor, author of the fascinating
book ``Mani.'' The tables are under a grape arbor overlooking the
sea. Dinner for two with house wine, around $20. Dinner nightly;
open all day on weekends in summer.
 &HT;    The Rapteas family run Agrogiali, (30-721) 77335, formerly a
taverna and now an ouzeria serving drinks, snacks and sweets. It's
on the southern end of the main beach. At the Krifos Kipos taverna
in Agios Nikolaos, you can sit at a table on the marina or under
the enormous plum tree in the back garden.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The amphitheater at Epidaurus, built in the 4th century B.C., is
spectacularly well preserved, and the site also includes the ruins
of an ancient therapeutic center. Open daily from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m.;
admission $4.15. There are also concerts in the theater during July
and August. Call (30-753) 22009 for a schedule.
 &HT;    Near the west coast of the Peloponnesus, the ruins at Olympia,
(30-624) 22517, are open 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily except Monday, when
hours are noon to 7 p.m. The museum is also excellent. Combined
ticket, $5.55.
 &HT;    The site at Mycenae, (30-751) 76585, is open 8 a.m. to 7 p.m.
daily; admission $4.35.
 &HT;    One of the most unusual medieval ruins is Monemvasia, built on a
massive rock that rises dramatically from the sea, off the east
coast of the Peloponnesus. For information, call the local tourist
agency, Malvasia Travel, (30-732) 61752.

THAT FLYING SENSATION

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY JERRY HAINES  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    However unfashionable it may be to admit it, I like to fly on
commuter airlines. I like to feel the water when I swim, I like to
taste the food when I eat, and I like to feel as if I'm flying when
I fly.
 &HT;    This is not a knock on the big airlines or their efficiency in
transporting billions of passengers or their safety records. But,
really, as you pass from the passenger lounge to the ``people
eater'' to the plane, and then back again at your destination, can
you really say that you have flown? Wasn't it more like being in a
series of large rooms?
 &HT;    It's just that in one of them they project movies of aerial
scenery outside the windows, and once in a while a burly stagehand
bounces the room on the director's cue of ``Looks like we're gonna
have a little turbulence, here, folks.''
 &HT;    Personally, I am delighted when I note on my itinerary the
asterisk that leads me to the footnote, ``Operated by
Somebody-You-Never-Heard-Of Airlines'' _ notwithstanding the big
corporation's logo on the plane or the masthead on the in-flight
magazine.
 &HT;    My expectations are validated when, at some stopover, I am
advised that my connecting flight is at D-78. At the very end of
the concourse, I take the escalator down, and suddenly it's as if
I'm in a different airport. There are no admirals' clubs or sports
bars here; the ceilings are low, and there is no music system. In
contrast to the gates upstairs, which are city blocks apart, the
gates here are all in one big room.
 &HT;    The boarding announcements override one another, like competing
rug merchants shouting out bargains in a bazaar. (I expect them to
try to talk me out of my destination: ``You don't want Duluth, my
friend. Evansville is right for you. I could take 30 percent off
that fare.'') There are no monitors or electronic signs. Rather,
gate agents manually insert cardboard numbers on a display board.
 &HT;    The only available food here is from vending machines. But the
food upstairs is overpriced, underseasoned and hyperfatty _ even if
it does come on a lettuce leaf. Eat your Cheez Doodles and drink
your Dr Pepper.
 &HT;    Passengers in the bullpen seats strain to sort out the
information about their respective flights. (``Did she say,
'Wichita' or 'Wichita Falls'?'') When we do board, there is little
ceremony. There is no separate loading of celebrities into first
class (indeed, the concept of first class on a commuter flight
would provoke giggles), and the entire process takes only about 10
minutes. Often the gate agent will walk us to the plane. I wonder
whether the agent is going to fly the plane, too.
 &HT;    I love these walks out to the plane. Like kindergarten kids on a
field trip, we stay close together as we follow our agent across
the Tarmac. And we're actually on the Tarmac. Little tractors and
baggage carts zip around us like deerflies as we keep a wary eye
out for approaching Airbuses. We can hear the plane engines and the
yelling of crew members. We can smell the jet fuel and feel the
prop wash. It's a sensory experience that has all but disappeared
as the airline industry strives to make air travel as
nonthreatening as possible.
 &HT;    The seating inside the plane is cramped, but at least it makes
sense to have 20 cramped seats on a small plane instead of hundreds
of them on a 747. And there are no middle seats; in fact, sometimes
a seat is both ``aisle'' and ``window.''
 &HT;    It is true that there is less space for carry-on luggage and
that we'll end up checking it. But, unlike passengers on the big
planes, I can see the guys loading it. And they can see me seeing
them. Further, when I get to where I'm going, I will just pick up
my luggage at planeside and roll through the terminal to the taxi
stand, while the people from those big planes stare at the empty,
revolving carousel and curse.
 &HT;    Many of the planes are prop jets, so that I actually can see the
engines start and the propellers begin to spin. (I wish they were
real propeller engines, though, so that starting them would sound
like that climactic moment in ``Casablanca,'' where the plane
engine starts with a whining kick.)
 &HT;    Like their counterparts on the airborne cruise ships, flight
attendants on these planes (usually only one) do the little drill
about seat belts and emergency exits and seat cushions that are
usable as flotation devices, but people actually pay attention
here. The attendant then plops into the jump seat and the plane
taxis out toward the runway.
 &HT;    As with the boarding, the taxiing seems more efficient. This
plane doesn't need help pushing back from its parking space any
more than a cabdriver needs help pulling away from the curb. The
pilot just puts down the flag on the meter and we're off for a
drive across the concrete.
 &HT;    A lot of the passengers appear to be regulars _ sales
representatives, tech reps and other itinerants who have gotten to
know the flight attendants and who kibitz with them. The plane
shudders in the backwash of a launching wide-body, then it's our
turn, and we are effortlessly airborne.
 &HT;    The flight itself is closer to the ground, and we can see the
scenery. (I had flown dozens of times into Ronald Reagan National
Airport, for example, but not until I flew there by commuter plane
was I truly impressed by Washington's memorials, the Pentagon and
those bobsledlike turns that planes must take as they approach
along the Potomac.)
 &HT;    Of course that same low altitude means that in bad weather, the
pilot can't get us above it. We are simply in it, and we can only
endure it. We macho types pretend not to be alarmed as the contents
of our soda glass hover above the glass momentarily when we hit an
air pocket.
 &HT;    ``Hey, at Busch Gardens you'd have to pay 10 bucks for a ride
like this,'' we joke (and then resume mumbling prayers). I try to
think of it as my Authentic Flying Experience. Real mashed potatoes
have lumps; real flying has bumps.
 &HT;    Soon we sense the impending landing (in our ears --
pressurization sometimes is a scarce commodity), and we return our
seat backs to their full upright position (as opposed to the
91-degree position we used for relaxing).
 &HT;    We're down quickly, the pilot does that little prop-reversal
thing that halts the plane on a dime, and we chug over toward the
terminal, where we stop several yards from the building. I expect
the pilot to caution, ``Now, everyone remember where we parked.''
 &HT;    I wonder whether the pilots, flight attendants and gate agents
are happy here in the farm club. Do the pilots dream of setting
down a 747 at Narita or Charles de Gaulle or Leonardo da Vinci? Do
the flight attendants look enviously toward the big ships that have
entire teams to do all of the things that one person does on a
commuter flight? Do the gate agents aspire to a life upstairs where
one might see the sun and buy $6 pizza slices?
 &HT;    I surely hope not. I hope they enjoy it as much as I do. Now if
they'd only let me sit up front with the pilots.

 By ADELE MALOTT 
 Condensed from The Mature Traveler Newsletter 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 CORRECTION  
 &HT;    A recent Mature Traveler column reported that Hilton's Senior
HHonors program has been extended to include Doubletree, Hampton,
Homewood Suites and Embassy Suites. This is incorrect. The Senior
HHonors membership program for those ages 60 and older is valid
only at Hiltons and Conrad International Hotels. For more details,
call (800) 432-3600, or visit www.hilton.com on the Web.
 &HT;    -----
 &HT;    I love to hear from readers _ especially when their questions
are ones that will benefit many mature travelers.
 &HT;    Here's a selection of questions that recently crossed my desk.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR TMT:  
 &HT;    Your book, ``The Mature Traveler's Book of Deals,'' refers to
the French Carte Vermeil railroad pass, but I can't find any other
references to it. What can you tell me about it? _ Tom Lowell, San
Antonio, Texas
 &HT;    
 &HT;    DEAR MR. LOWELL:  
 &HT;    It's probably a bit hard to find since it has a new name, Carte
Senior, and it replaces the two earlier Carte Vermeil travel cards.
Travelers ages 60 and older can buy a Carte Senior for 290 francs _
the equivalent of about $42 U.S. _ at a French railway station to
get reductions of up to 50 percent off standard rail prices. The
pass is good for a year.
 &HT;    Carte Senior holders also are entitled to 30 percent off the
standard price for all train trips in 23 European countries that
use the Rail Europe Senior plan.
 &HT;    You will need to bring an identity photo in addition to your
passport when applying for a Carte Senior pass at the ticket
office. The Web site www.sncf.fr gives some background but does not
reveal a ticket price until you have made a reservation.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR TMT:  
 &HT;    I am planning a round-trip train ride to San Diego, Calif., in
August. Please help me with information about train travel. _ Tom
Ladner, Levittown, Penn.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR MR. LEVITTOWN  
 &HT;    First, call Amtrak, (800) 872-7245, to see about travel dates
and fares. Amtrak discounts its railfares by 15 percent for those
ages 62 or older. However, the fare you pay depends on how full the
train is.
 &HT;    For example, when I recently checked with Amtrak, senior fares
for a chair ticket from your area to San Diego ranged from $356.50
to $898 _ and the latter price was for a nearly full train. Of
course, a compartment costs more.
 &HT;    Here are two possible routes:
 &HT;    Take the Amtrak Three Rivers from Trenton, N.J., to Chicago,
where you will transfer to the California Zephyr, which will take
you via Denver to Oakland. There you will board the Coast Starlight
to travel along the California coast to Los Angeles, where you will
get on the San Diegan for the last leg of the trip.
 &HT;    Or, take the Nutmeg to New York, where you will transfer to the
Three Rivers to go to Chicago. In Chicago, you will board the
Southwest Chief, which travels cross country via Albuquerque, N.M.,
to Fullerton, a Los Angeles suburb, where you will board the San
Diegan.
 &HT;    For more information, call the San Diego Convention and Visitors
Bureau at (619) 232-3101.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR TMT: 
 &HT;    My wife and I have some travel questions that we hope you can
answer:
 &HT;    1) Whom should we contact to arrange traveling between England
and France by train?
 &HT;    2) What is the procedure for obtaining a National Parks Golden
Age Passport?
 &HT;    _ A.E. Lockert, Jr. Nashville, Tenn.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR MR. LOCKERT:  
 &HT;    1) To book travel on Eurostar (under the English Channel),
contact your travel agent or Rail Europe, which is the North
American supplier of European rail products. Call (800) 438-7245,
or www.raileurope.com on the Web.
 &HT;    2) If you are 62 or older you can buy a lifetime Golden Age
Passport for $10. Passports are available at any national park, or
you can contact the National Park Service, P.O. Box 37127,
Washington, D.C. 20013; www.nps.gov.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE.)
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR TMT:  
 &HT;    To whom should I write to get a travel itinerary for Helen, Ga.?
Your help is greatly appreciated.
 &HT;    _ Ethel Spade, West Palm Beach, Fla.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR MRS. SPADE:  
 &HT;    First call your travel agent and ask about motorcoach companies
that plan trips to Helen. Or ask the agent if he/she knows a travel
club or church group going to Helen that you could call.
 &HT;    If the travel agent can't help, I would contact information
centers and ask which motorcoach companies include a Helen
itinerary.
 &HT;    Try contacting:
 &HT;    _ Alpine Helen-White County Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau, P.O.
Box 730, Helen, Ga. 30545; (706) 878-2181.
 &HT;    _ Helen Welcome Center, City Hall - Chattahoochee St., Helen,
Ga. 30545; (706) 878-2521.
 &HT;    _ The Georgia Tourist Division, (404) 656-3595.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE.)
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR TMT: 
 &HT;    I read your column every Sunday and enjoy it very much. But I
have a suggestion: In future articles, could you give the distances
from major airports to town centers and include if public transport
is available? Many of us prefer not to rent cars.
 &HT;    One of your columns reads, ``Banff is easily accessible via
90-minute drive from Calgary airport!'' A 20-minute trip by cab,
bus or shuttle is a more reasonable distance. _ John Lancaster,
Doylestown, PA.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR MR. LANCASTER:  
 &HT;    I will be happy to work airport/city center information into
future articles when it is appropriate. The handy reference book
``Salk International's Airport Transit Guide'' is also a great
help. For a current copy of the book, call Magellan's at (800)
962-4943. The price is $9.95 and includes shipping and handling.
 &HT;    The guide gives the kind of information you want and includes
average prices for shuttles and cabs as well as where to get them
and which routes are recommended.
 &HT;    Regarding the Banff to Calgary transfer: There are shuttles that
run regularly between the two points, giving you a chance to relax
and enjoy the scenery.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR TMT:  
 &HT;    My sister and I are planning a trip to New York to visit Ellis
Island to see our parents' names are on the immigrants' wall. We
want an escorted tour that lasts about three days. We'd like to be
escorted from the airport to our hotel and then to Battery Park,
etc. The only travel company I have located includes four extra
days in New York. Do you know of any of short length? _ Eileen
Wozneski, Palm City, Fla.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR MS. WOZNESKI: 
 &HT;    I recommend that you work with Gray Line of New York, (800)
669-0051. Gray Line does offer airport transfers from each airport
to most hotels in Manhattan for rates ranging from $16 to $19 per
person.
 &HT;    And Gray Line has a number of escorted tours within the city.
Several incorporate visits to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis
Island with other attractions.
 &HT;    For senior travelers, I always recommend the Big Apple Greeters,
(212) 669-2896. It's not a tour, but is made up of local volunteers
who showcase those parts of New York they know best.
 &HT;    The Greeters prefer to be contacted a minimum of 10 days before
any planned trip so they can match your needs with the available
volunteers' specialities.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Readers are invited to submit questions and comments to Adele
Malott, c/o The New York Times Syndicate, 122 East 42nd St., 14th
Floor, New York, N.Y. 10168. Send Adele a postcard from your trip
with ideas, questions and information on the bargains you find for
seniors.

 &HT;    
 By WILLIAM T. TOMICKI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;     Q:  My wife and I are headed to Melbourne, Australia. Can you
recommend a culinary hot spot there?
 &HT;     A:  You couldn't find a more popular restaurant than the sleek
Radii at the Park Hyatt Melbourne, where chef Paul Wilson is
earning rave reviews.
 &HT;    This vibrant, multilevel experience with an open kitchen has a
wood-fired oven, bar and cigar lounge. Chef Wilson prepares what he
calls ``modern cuisine'' using quality produce true to its natural
flavor.
 &HT;    This is exciting food of superb quality. Expect dishes such as
scallops in a citrus beurre blanc; cassoulet of blue eye and clams;
and sauternes custard. There's also rotisseried leg of lamb,
risotto, roasted trout, grilled chicken and duck. The menu is
brave. Wines are fairly priced at Radii and service is impeccable.
All dishes are designed to share. Desserts are extravagant.
 &HT;    For more information, call 9224-1211.
 &HT;     Q:  I am planning a three-week trip to China in September. I am
having trouble finding anyone who understands the exchange rates
and how to do it. I am aware that you can bring a limited amount of
money in or out, but where do you get it? I am trying to avoid long
lines and hassles at the airport, and my bank tells me they do not
trade in this currency. Help!
 &HT;     : . Regarding the pre-purchase of Chinese currency, there are
two official names for the currency, renminbi (RMB) and kuai.
 &HT;    Our sources at Export International Currency Express do not
advise on pre-purchasing large amounts of RMB because the rate is
not very favorable compared to exchanging in China. The CITIC bank
in Beijing, on Jiangguomenwai Street, is very efficient.
 &HT;    However, Export International Currency Exchange can arrange for
a smaller amount to be made in advance to hold you over until you
can reach a proper bank. You can contact them at (888) 278-6628.
Best wishes for a wonderful trip through China.
 &HT;     : . My husband and I are looking for a quick getaway to the
Arizona desert. Do you know of any value-priced packages at nicer
resorts?
 &HT;     A:  The Royal Palms Hotel and Casitas is offering a variety of
well-priced packages for those seeking some rest and relaxation in
the desert. The Phoenix property is managed by Destination Hotels
and Resorts and is part of a collection of distinctive upscale
hotels and resorts known for their luxurious standards and
exceptional recreational opportunities.
 &HT;    The Royal Romance package, which costs $279 for two days and one
night, includes Plaza Suite accommodation and sensual amenities
such as champagne and chocolate-covered strawberries.
 &HT;    The Royal Tee, which starts at $269 for two days and one night,
includes daily breakfast and a round of golf at one of several top
golf courses in the area.
 &HT;    The Royal Treatment, $399 for two days and one night, includes
Plaza suite accommodation, and an in-room or cabana massage for
each guest, as well as complimentary use of the fitness center.
 &HT;    For those looking for accommodations only, the Royal Palms is
offering a summer promotional rate of $149 per room, per night. For
reservations or more information, call (800) 672-6011.
 &HT;     Q:  I've been to Africa once before, but I felt very much like
a tourist the entire time and left feeling unsatisfied. I'd like to
try again, but I really want to get a feel for the various local
cultures and really experience Africa. Any suggestions?
 &HT;     A:  The best way to experience local culture anywhere is to
just immerse yourself in it. Bush Homes of East Africa offers a
``true African experience'' by housing guests at private residences
and ranches so they can experience the personable hospitality of
Kenyans and witness their lifestyle.
 &HT;    Visitors get the chance to mix with villagers by learning about
local farming customs, regional wildlife, and join in with the
daily life of the nomadic Ndorobo people. This is definitely NOT
your average safari trip.
 &HT;    For more information on prices and locations, visit
www.bush-homes.co.ke on the Web.
 &HT;    This trip _ and more like it _ can be found in the Spring/Summer
2000 Specialty Travel Index, $10 per year for two issues. Send
orders to info(AT)specialitytravel.com.
 &HT;     Q:  My niece has been working at a quality golf resort, but she
feels her career is stalled. She has an excellent eye for design
and loves the sport. Any suggestions on how she might kickstart her
career and remain in this exciting industry?
 &HT;     A:  Your niece may be a perfect candidate for the new Master's
Degree in Golf Course Architecture at Edinburgh College of Art in
Scotland _ see www.eca.ac.uk. The one-year program has the full
blessing of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club. With St. Andrews just
one hour from Edinburgh, students will carry out fieldwork at the
Old Course and many of Scotland's hidden gems. Tuition is
approximately $12,175.
 &HT;    Contact Edinburgh College of Art, Edinburgh, Scotland. telephone

 &HT;    Readers are invited to submit questions to William Tomicki, P.O.
Box 5148, Santa Barbara, Calif. 93150. Although he cannot answer
each query individually, selected questions will be included in his
column. Mr. Tomicki, who logs over 150,000 miles each year, is the
publisher of ENTREE, a travel newsletter.

SHOPPING AROUND: PLANNING FAMILY TRAVEL ON THE WEB

 (Color slide included.) 
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Still haven't planned a summer family getaway?
 &HT;    Then get on the Web. There are some great sites out there that
are fast, efficient and can help save money. Some can help reveal a
cheaper airfare or car-rental deal. Others can aid in unearthing
the perfect hotel or inn. So take these steps to get the best
vacation value this summer.
 &HT;    For those who can't decide between a cottage by shore, a
national park visit, or a trip to Florida, do a little research.
Disney's site, Family.com (www.family.com), has vacation advice of
all kinds, helping travelers plan trips by location and by type.
 &HT;    Anyone looking for an inexpensive family restaurant in
Yellowstone National Park, a bed &AMP; breakfast in Vermont or a hotel
in Chicago that will accept the family dog should go to Fodor's
(www.fodors.com), the Web site of the famed guidebooks. It's
well-organized, detailed and opinionated.
 &HT;    Also have a look at Arthur Frommer's Budget Travel
(www.frommers.com), where there is loads of information about
underrated and inexpensive places such as Portugal and Greece.
 &HT;    Frommer and his staff seek out low-cost ways to take vacations
that just seem expensive, like beach holidays. They also look for
unusual and cost-saving options, such as volunteer vacations with
the Sierra Club.
 &HT;    Fodors travel guides are connected to Concierge.com
(www.concierge.com), the Web site of Conde Nast publications, a
good resource for bed &AMP; breakfasts, resort hotels and lakeside
retreats. For those who want a peek at more luxurious vacations,
``Travel + Leisure''s Web site (www.pathfinder.com/travel/TL) has
the current issue and back issues available through a good search
engine.
 &HT;    If a vacation paradise must include sand and palm trees,
Pleasant Hawaiian Holidays (www.pleasanthawaian.com) are
discounters who can put together a range of well-priced
air/hotel/transfer deals to the islands, utilizing a large stock of
hotels and condos. Their sister company, Pleasant Mexico Holidays,
can do the same south of the border.
 &HT;    For the world beyond, check out Time Out (www.timeout.com),
which is like going online with an English accent. This site takes
the best of Time Out's city guides and city listing magazines and
puts them on the web.
 &HT;    Rough Guides (http://travel.roughguides.com) are written with
the independent traveler in mind and Lonely Planet
(www.lonelyplanet.com) set the standards for such travel. Then look
at BootsnAll.com (http://216.110.36.72/cgi-bin/gt/index.shtml),
which refers to itself as ``The Ultimate Resource for the
Independent Traveller,'' with a host of first-person stories by
young people traveling cheaply around the world.
 &HT;    The Europe-bound should head to Rail Europe's site
(www.raileurope.com), a godsend for anyone who has tried to plan a
rail journey through Europe. This site has schedules and fares for
point-to-point train fares, Eurailpasses, multi-country passes,
single country passes and rail 'n' drive passes. They also offer
Eurostar tickets from London to Brussels or Paris.
 &HT;    For getaways to American cities, check out discount hotel
brokers like Quikbook (www.quikbook.com) and Hotel Reservations
Network (www.180096hotel.com). Figure on discounts from 15 percent
to 40 percent off published rates in major city hotels, based on
availability, of course.
 &HT;    Once the hotel is booked, have a look at CultureFinder.com
(www.culturefinder.com), which has thousands of listings for opera,
ballet or theater performances in dozens of cities around the
country. In some cases, event tickets can be ordered online. Both
Digitalcity (www.digitalcity.com) and Citysearch.com
(www.citysearch.com) have a city-by-city list of restaurants and
shops, as well as sightseeing, arts and other entertainment. These
sites can make a visitor feel like local.
 &HT;    Biking, hiking and multisport vacations with the family are a
terrific way to spend a week or two outdoors with like-minded
families. But it can be daunting to sort through and evaluate
hundreds of similar-sounding adventure companies. So visit G.O.R.P.
(www.gorp.com), an acronym for the Great Outdoor Recreation Pages,
which has adventure travel stories and links to dozens of
outfitters who offer hiking, biking, kayaking and white water
rafting trips.
 &HT;    For those who have to fly, check out upcoming deals and sales on
the Web sites of American Airlines (www.aa.com), Continental
(www.flycontinental.com), United Airlines (www.ual.com), Delta
(www.delta-air.com), TWA (www.twa.com), USAirways
(www.usairways.com) and Northwest (www.flynwa.com).
 &HT;    Both Expedia.com (www.expedia.com) and Travelocity
(www.travelocity.com) have fast and sophisticated fare-finders.
They also offer short-term deals, sale fares and specials. It's
relatively quick and easy to book an entire vacation on these
sites, from airline seats to hotel rooms and car rentals. But
price-sensitive shoppers should also take a look at Lowestfare.com
(www.lowestfare.com), 1Travel.com (www.onetravel.com) and
Cheaptickets.com (www.cheaptickets.com).
 &HT;    As for specialized tickets, such as around-the-world tickets and
discounted business class tickets, look at TicketPlanet.com
(www.ticketplanet.com). Finally, for those with a yen to go cheaply
to Japan, China or other Asian destinations, Chisholm Travel
(www.chisholmair.net) is the best source.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By LARRY ROHTER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Superlatives come quickly to mind when talking about Sao Paulo.
With 18 million people in its metropolitan area, this is the
largest city in Brazil, the largest in South America, indeed the
largest in the Southern Hemisphere.
 &HT;    It boasts of having the largest population of Japanese descent
of any city outside Japan, the largest of Lebanese descent of any
city outside the Middle East, the largest of Italian descent of any
city outside Italy, and more wealth than any city in what used to
be called the third world.
 &HT;    Paulistanos, as residents of the city are known, have always
taken pride in the cosmopolitan environment they have constructed
around them during the past century, but rarely more so than now.
 &HT;    All year long, Brazil is marking the 500th anniversary of the
arrival of the first Portuguese expedition to the New World, and
Sao Paulo, with a melting-pot population that personifies the
Brazilian ideal of racial democracy, is a focal point of the
commemorations.
 &HT;    Those who come to Sao Paulo expecting to find a laid-back
seaside tropical resort in the style of Rio de Janeiro or Salvador
are in for a shock. Sao Paulo is a very different kind of Brazil:
aggressive, sprawling and resourceful, with a different climate,
including temperatures that can drop to near-freezing at night
during the Southern Hemisphere winter (June through September).
 &HT;    Instead, Sao Paulo's charms are distinctly urban: restaurants,
museums, concerts, nightclubs, parks and window shopping along
Avenida Paulista, the main commercial boulevard. So are the
problems the city confronts, including poverty, crime and police
brutality. But even a confirmed Tropicalist like the pop singer
Caetano Veloso was forced to confess that, as he wrote in a homage
to the busiest intersection in Brazil's busiest city, ``Something
happens in my heart every time I turn the corner of Ipiranga and
Sao Joao.''
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    The magnificent exhibition known as ``Brazil+500'' is the
largest show of Brazilian art ever assembled, spread over an area
larger than the Louvre in four separate buildings. With some 15,000
pieces on display, it is hard to talk about highlights, but the
sections focusing on Indian, folk and Afro-Brazilian art have drawn
especially lavish praise from local and international critics.
Admission is $5.75 on weekdays and $8.50 on weekends, at 1.8 real
to the dollar. Telephone (55-11) 573-6073. Until Sept. 7 at
Ibirapuera Park.
 &HT;    To mark the 500th anniversary of the Portuguese arrival, leading
Brazilian and Portuguese pop musicians are offering a monthly
series of free joint concerts at Ibirapuera Park. On July 30,
Gilberto Gil, Maria Joao and Mario Laginha will perform together,
with Ney Matogrosso and Marta Dias scheduled for Aug. 13 and Gal
Costa and Madredeus closing the series on Sept. 9.
 &HT;    Sao Paulo has numerous music halls featuring Brazil's top
artists, with performance schedules published in newspapers and
monthly English-language tourist guides. One winter highlight
promises to be a number of shows by the brilliant pop singer Marisa
Monte at the Palace, Avenida dos Jamaris 213 in Moema. She will be
performing weekends from July 27 through Sept. 9, with tickets $10
and up; (55-11) 5643-2569.
 &HT;    No rivalry in international soccer is more intense than that
between Brazil, which has captured the World Cup four times, and
Argentina, which has won it twice. The national teams of the two
countries will play each other on July 26 at the 80,000-seat
Morumbi Stadium, Sao Paulo's largest, at Praca Roberto Gomes
Pedrosa 1, Jardim Leonor, as part of the qualifying round for the
2002 World Cup. Call (55-11) 3749-8000 for information about
tickets (prices to be announced shortly before the match).
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    Ibirapuera Park is to Sao Paulo what Central Park is to New York
City: an island of green and calm amid traffic and skyscrapers. It
has numerous museums and pavilions, many of them designed by the
renowned Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer, and open spaces that
include lakes and playgrounds, which draw large crowds of families
on weekends. The planetarium, $2.85, is especially interesting
because it displays the constellations of the Southern Hemisphere.
The park is open daily, 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.; (55-11) 574-5177.
 &HT;    Exhibitions in which venom is extracted from snakes are no
longer offered to the public, but the Instituto Butantan, Avenida
Vital Brasil 1500 in the Butanta area, remains perhaps the city's
most popular tourist attraction.
 &HT;    One of the world's leading reptile research centers, it has a
collection of more than 60,000 animals, and its small museum
features live spiders and scorpions as well as poisonous snakes
with exotic names like jararaca and mussurana. Open Tuesday through
Sunday, 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Admission is 85 cents; 55 cents for
children; (55-11) 813-7222.
 &HT;    The Memorial to the Immigrant, at Rua Visconde de Parnaiba 1316
in Bras, is the Brazilian equivalent of Ellis Island. Nearly three
million people from 60 different countries, including the United
States, came through this processing center during the 91 years it
operated before closing in 1978, and their contributions to
Brazilian society are honored in thorough, fascinating exhibits in
a somewhat nondescript complex of brick buildings done in
neo-Classical style. Open Tuesday through Sunday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Admission $1.15, half price for children; (55-11) 6693-0917.
 &HT;    Installed in one of the city's uglier buildings is its best
museum, known as the MASP, or Museu de Arte de Sao Paulo. The
collection here is said to be the largest and most impressive in
Latin America, with European masters like Rembrandt, van Gogh,
Goya, El Greco and Monet as well as leading Brazilian artists such
as Portinari, Anita Malfatti and Tarsila do Amaral. On Sunday an
antiques and arts and crafts fair is held on the square outside the
museum. Open Tuesday through Sunday, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; admission
$5.75. Avenida Paulista 1578; (55-11) 251-5644.
 &HT;    Also on Sundays, the ``Discover Sao Paulo'' program offers three
bus tours departing from the Praca da Republica downtown. The Green
route shows visitors parks and gardens, the Cultural itinerary
visits the principal museums, and the Historic tour stops at old
homes and monuments. Tickets _ $2.85; $1.15 for children _ are sold
at tourist offices or through (55-11) 6971-5000.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    By Brazilian standards, Sao Paulo hotels can be absurdly
overpriced. Rates mimic those of New York, with service and
amenities that cost half as much in Rio de Janeiro or Salvador. But
on weekends, when business travelers leave, rates at major hotels
can drop by 30 percent.
 &HT;    Few of Sao Paulo's hotels are more reliable or convenient than
the Crowne Plaza, just off Avenida Paulista at Rua Frei Caneca 1360
in Cerqueira Cesar. Remodeled not long ago, it has 220 rooms and
large beds and bathtubs in which to sink at the end of a long day.
A standard double starts at $198 a night through the chain's
``Summer Options'' program. Telephone (55-11) 253-2244 or (800)
227-6963; fax (55-11) 251-3121.
 &HT;    In the 1970s, the Grand Hotel Ca D'Oro, Rua Augusta 129 in
Consolacao, was the most elegant place to stay in Sao Paulo. The
neighborhood has fallen on hard times, but the 265 rooms, most
still decorated in the same style as they were back then, are
large, and the Italian restaurant on the ground floor is one of the
best in town. Doubles are $150, breakfast included; (55-11)
236-4300, fax (55-11) 236-4311.
 &HT;    Budget: Sao Paulo is awash in what are known as ``flats,''
apartment hotels aimed primarily at the long-term business visitor
but also available to the tourist. One especially good option is
the Parthenon chain, which operates a score of these residential
hotels. Rooms at some, such as the Parthenon St. Germain on Rua
Padre Joao Manuel 202 in Cerqueira Cesar, start at $60, with
breakfast. The top price at this chain is $100. Call (800) 111790
for reservations; fax (55-11) 883-2476.
 &HT;    The Best Western Porto do Sol, Rua Tutoia 77 in Cerqueira Cesar,
is halfway between Avenida Paulista and Ibirapuera Park and
convenient to many good restaurants. Its 198 rooms, while simple,
are as clean and attractive as those of its much more expensive
neighbors. A double starts at $100, with an ample breakfast buffet
of tropical fruits and juices; (55-11) 3059-5000, fax (55-11)
3059-5193.
 &HT;    Luxury: Big, swaggering, always crowded and boasting such
curiosities as a restaurant specializing in Danish cuisine, the
Maksoud Plaza Hotel, Alameda Campinas 150 in Bela Vista, has become
something of a landmark since it opened 20 years ago. But the
imposing atrium and 415 rooms are starting to show their age, and
there is a certain air of snobbery that can be disconcerting.
Doubles from $350; (55-11) 253-4411, fax (55-11) 253-4544.
 &HT;    On the other side of Avenida Paulista, at Alameda Santos 1123,
sits the Inter-Continental Sao Paulo. The 193 rooms here are larger
than those at several other luxury hotels, the atmosphere is one of
cool efficiency, and there are many good places to eat within
walking distance. Doubles are normally $400, but some are available
through Sept. 15 at the ``Summer Options'' price of $200. Telephone
(55-11) 3179-2600 or (800) 327-0200; fax (55-11) 3179-2669.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    Year after year, Baby-Beef Rubaiyat is the runaway winner in
every survey of Sao Paulo's best churrascarias, restaurants
specializing in grilled meat. The cuts may seem unfamiliar to the
American palate, but the meat here is extraordinarily tender and
lean, perhaps because the restaurant has its own ranch where it
raises cattle, hogs, sheep and chicken. Of the two branches, the
more convenient is at Alameda Santos 86 in Paraiso. Dinner for two
with beer, about $65; (55-11) 289-6366.
 &HT;    In theory, Antiquarius, Alameda Lorena 1884 in Cerqueira Cesar,
specializes solely in Portuguese cuisine. But one of its signature
dishes is a singular mixture of Lusitanian and Brazilian
ingredients: a startlingly delicate codfish moqueca, or stew, laced
with coconut milk. The atmosphere is charmingly rustic. Dinner for
two with a bottle of sparkling Portuguese vinho verde: about $125;
(55-11) 282-3015
 &HT;    The menu at Amadeus, Rua Haddock Lobo 807 in Cerqueira Cesar, is
devoted to seafood in all its forms, freshly caught just off the
coast less than 50 miles away. Traditional Brazilian sauces, which
make liberal use of coconut milk, palm oil, onions, tomato and
peppers, are the main feature, but a terrific shrimp curry is also
on the menu. Dinner for two with a bottle of Brazilian wine is
about $110; (55-11) 3061-2859.
 &HT;    In a city blessed with dozens of excellent Italian restaurants
and cantinas, Massimo, at Alameda Santos 1826 in Cerqueira Cesar,
stands at the head of the class. The osso buco is so tender it
almost melts off the bone, and the cheeses, eggplant, peppers and
olives used in the antipasto are extraordinarily fresh. Dinner for
two is about $125 (no credit cards accepted); (55-11) 284-3011.
 &HT;    For cheap, appetizing eating, Paulistanos often turn to
restaurants offering food by the kilogram, most of which charge
$4.50 to $5.50 a pound. There is a large concentration of these
self-service buffet-style cafeterias in Rua Augusta. One that
stands out for its varied menu and mouth-watering desserts is the
Parque Avenida Grill, Avenida Paulista 1776; (55-11) 283-0201.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By NICOLE KRAUSS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The first time I was in the Peloponnesus, it was midwinter, and
out of the low fog that was everywhere goatherds seemed to appear
and dissolve as if in a Theo Angelopoulos film. The narrow roads
etched into the mountainside threatened to fall off into clouds.
 &HT;    At every switchback turn, a small, mailbox-like shrine with
faded icon, biscuits and half-empty bottle of Fanta seemed placed
to ensure safe passage.
 &HT;    Despite the cool air, the orange groves along the roadside were
fragrant, and as I walked between the rows of trees, the silence
was punctuated by the thud of ripe oranges dropping. The
archaeological sites _ and often it seemed the peninsula itself _
were empty of people.
 &HT;    Aside from the phantom goatherds and the men in the kafeneia
smoking and fingering their knotted worry beads, the most evident
signs of life were the occasional smoldering heaps of rubbish that
slid down the mountainside like scree.
 &HT;    In that strange weather there was something almost threatening
about the loom and lunge of the mountains. Alone among the ruins of
Olympia or Epidaurus, I couldn't shake a feeling of eerieness and
half expected, at any moment, to encounter some ancient shade
walking among the broken columns.
 &HT;    It's no surprise that at times the Peloponnesus seems haunted.
The Isle of Pelops is named for the boy slaughtered and cooked by
his father, Tantalus, and served to the gods. Brought back to life
by the outraged Zeus, Pelops eventually became a king.
 &HT;    Later a curse was put on him by a man he tricked, so that for
generations the House of Pelops was plagued by murders and
vendettas, by the same grisly plots compulsively repeated.
 &HT;    But in spring the Peloponnesus changes. It is as if the curse
lifts with the fog and the valleys and hillsides suddenly flower.
With 6,000 species of flowering plants, Greece has some of the most
extensive flora of any European country. The fields fill with
larkspur, anemones and asphodel, with stalks of giant fennel in
whose slow-burning pith Prometheus brought fire to the Earth. Pink
and white oleanders hem the roads, and house fronts are decorated
with shocks of bougainvillea.
 &HT;    But despite the abundance of flowers and the bright sun, much of
the Peloponnesus retains a kind of severity year-round: even in
that fabled idyll, Arcadia, the barren mountain peaks are always
present. The occasional monasteries built into sheer cliff faces
remind the traveler of the isolation of the place.
 &HT;    This time I returned to the Peloponnesus in June, to rent a
house with a friend on the beach with no address or phone. Aside
from this, its most remarkable detail was the blowzy red lampshade
that hung, with its delusions of grandeur, over the kitchen table.
Everything else about the house was simple and rustic.
 &HT;    Its only luxury was the garden, so packed with oleanders, lemon,
fig and pomegranate trees that it threatened to engulf the cottage
in its green embrace. In Greece it is impossible to forget that
everything must eventually fall to ruin; what little remains
depends on freak chance or the serendipity of archaeologists.
 &HT;    Behind the garden walls that backed up onto a grove of
lime-washed olive trees, Ben and I spent whole days reading.
Clothes became mostly useless. Even as we read about ancient
Greece, civilization seemed to stall or slip a notch.
 &HT;    We told time by the constantly changing light or the sounds
around us: the clatter of cicadas or the bells from the small
church where the priest sang his drafty evensong, the doors on all
sides of the cruciform church thrown open to his congregation of
zero. Only in the evenings, when the stubborn heat finally began to
give in, would we venture out to swim in the clear Ionian Sea.
 &HT;    Our house was on the western coast of the Mani, the middle of
the three southern switchblades of land that jut into the sea. It
was partly Patrick Leigh Fermor's exhaustive book ``Mani,''
published in the 1950s, that originally drew us to the place; the
house we rented outside the little town of Stoupa was only a few
miles away from his.
 &HT;    Mr. Fermor describes the map of the southern part of the
Peloponnesus as ``a misshapen tooth fresh torn from its gum with
three peninsulas jutting southward in jagged and carious roots.''
The middle carious root _ a description that conjures not only its
shape but also its character _ is the Mani.
 &HT;    The sharp spine of the Taygetos mountain range rips down its
length, and on its hard, boulder-strewn plateaus a fierce and
passionate race of people lived in a perpetual state of war.
 &HT;    Descended from Spartans, Slavs, and Frankish crusaders, the
Maniots' way of life revolved around bloody family feuds waged with
yataghans (short Turkish sabers with double-curved blades), axes
and muskets; when a feud was on a Maniot could not leave his house
without dodging a volley of bullets.
 &HT;    The Maniots lived in austere stone tower houses, the better to
aim at and pick off a neighbor. They were feared by other Greeks,
many of whom still keep a wide berth of the peninsula. Not much
remains of the Maniots now, having killed off or tired each other
out, and their surviving progeny packed up and moved to Athens. The
wrecks of their domestic fortresses _ sometimes whole villages of
them _ seem outcroppings of the very rock that forms the wild and
lonely hills.
 &HT;    On weekends we explored the Peloponnesus _ often on overnight
trips _ in a car we rented in Stoupa, the town where Kazantzakis
created the larger-than-life character Zorba. On our first
excursion we headed south, deep into the Mani. We stopped for an
early breakfast at the Krifos Kipos taverna in the tiny fishing
village of Agios Nikolaos and watched the caiques come in, hung
with kerosene lanterns and laden with the morning's catch of fish.
 &HT;    The serenity was only occasionally punctured by cries of the
ubiquitous traveling salesmen who advertise their wares, whether
watermelons or plastic chairs, from megaphones mounted on the roofs
of their trucks.
 &HT;    After Agios Nikolaos the road climbs inland into the mountains
before cutting back to the coast to descend on the Bay of Limeni,
where the white-capped sea bites deeply into the cliffs. In the
Maniot town of Areopolis (named, appropriately, for the god of war)
the cobbled streets are lined with tower houses whose whitewashed
rooms look out onto slopes of prickly pear.
 &HT;    Nearby are the caves of Pirgos Dirou where, for less than the
mythical gold coin, a gruff Charon punted us on a skiff through the
miles of stalactite-hung grottoes said to extend inland as far as
Sparta.
 &HT;    After Areopolis the Mani becomes more desolate; this stretch of
the Taygetos is dubbed the Kakovounia, or Evil Mountains. In
summer, the temperature rises until it reaches the sort of heat
that breeds hallucinations or madness. Nothing much grows there
except for scrub or scorched grass, yet it is tremendously
beautiful.
 &HT;    At the highest points clusters of tower houses still stand vigil
above the sea. And everywhere the ruins of stout stone walls
criss-cross the plateaus: surreal boundaries that mark one share of
nothingness from the next. We passed a dust-covered mason breaking
stones by the roadside in the noonday sun, but he spoke no English
and we spoke little Greek and so we couldn't extract from him the
reason for that infinite network of senseless walls. But he happily
posed for a picture.
 &HT;    After the ghost town of Vatheia _ whose tower houses have been
converted into an eccentric hotel _ the peninsula narrows toward
its end, Cape Tainaron, the location of the mythical gates to the
Underworld. The beaches widen (Marmari is one of the most
beautiful) and the sea, surprisingly warm, breaks in tremendous
waves. By the time we arrived at the very tip of the cape it was
already evening.
 &HT;    Around the ruins of the Temple of Poseidon the wind bent the
gold grass toward the sea; directly above us the sky was stamped by
the first sliver of moon. Somewhere nearby was the cave where
Hercules supposedly descended to the Underworld to bring back the
three-headed dog, Cerberus. But we stopped short of finding it,
feeling some things are better left to the imagination.
 &HT;    The Peloponnesus has some of the finest classical ruins in the
world. The acoustics in the amphitheater of Epidaurus _ one of the
greatest sites _ are so perfect that even from the uppermost tier a
whisper from the stage is audible.
 &HT;    When I brushed my foot along the circle that marks center stage
a twang rang out as from an amplified steel guitar. Behind the
theater are the vast ruins of the spa where invalids came from all
over the Hellenic world to convalesce with the aid of therapeutic
baths, poultices and miraculous cures.
 &HT;    In the mountains of Arcadia, up a winding road of treacherous
hairpin turns, is the limestone Temple of Bassae, erected around
420 B.C. _ in the middle of nowhere _ by Ictinus, the architect of
the Parthenon. In Pylos, in the remains of Nestor's Palace, you can
stand in what's left of the great hall where Telemachus came to ask
for news of his father. The most remarkable surviving detail of the
ruins is an intact terra-cotta tub, last bathed in some 3,000 years
ago.
 &HT;    In the northeast region of the Peloponnesus is Mycenae, first
excavated in the 19th century by Heinrich Schliemann, the
indigo-merchant-turned-archaeologist who discovered Troy. Upon
opening the most elaborate of the royal tombs, he wrote to the King
of Greece, ``I have stared into the face of Agamemnon.''
 &HT;    From 1400 to 1200 B.C. Mycenae was the most powerful kingdom in
Greece. In the rooms of the ruined palace there, Clytemnestra and
her lover, Aegisthus, murdered her husband in a bath to avenge the
sacrifice of her daughter; her children Orestes and Electra, in
turn, murdered Clytemnestra.
 &HT;    To me, the most moving ancient site in the Peloponnesus is
Olympia. The first time I was there it was February and raining,
and I was alone in the place. It made such an impression on me
that, as the summer was running out, I insisted on a last trip to
see it again. Every four years, for almost 1,200 years, athletes
made a pilgrimage to this quiet grove of pines to strive to achieve
the heights of human strength, grace, speed and agility.
 &HT;    Although the hippodrome has long since sunk into the silt of the
Alfios River, the temples and most of the buildings remain, as does
the short-distance track. It is around 600 feet long, with hills
for specta tors on either side and stone slabs cut with grooves
where the runners crouched before the start signal. No one else was
around when we were there so we took our sandals off and raced each
other barefoot, neck and neck, pounding the ground packed down by
time and countless ancient races.
 &HT;    But history did not end on the Peloponnesus with the fall of
Greece. The landscape is scattered with signs of all who followed
the invasion of the Romans: Goths, Avars and Slavs, the Byzantines,
Franks, Turks and Venetians. After the perfection of Praxiteles'
sculptures or still-extant geometry of a Grecian temple, these
medieval ruins may seem crude and insubstantial.
 &HT;    But atop the rock of Monemvasia, inside the 13th-century
Byzantine church with its humbled frescoes, one suddenly feels the
illumination of those dark ages, sensing the very pattern of
history itself with its endlessly repeating eras of chaos and
order.
 &HT;    And even as one is constantly aware of all that has been lost,
there are also reminders of what is continuous: the
thousand-year-old monastery of St. John the Baptist outside the
mountain town of Stemnitsa, for example, where the monks waved down
to us from their hawk's perch to offer us coffee and a bowl of
Turkish de light.
 &HT;    At the end of each of our weekend excursions _ to the southern
tip of the Mani, to Monemvasia, Olympia, Arcadia _ we found
ourselves eager to return to our small house. After such a close
study of the ravages of time, there is a certain comfort in a place
where nothing seems to happen.
 &HT;    The day's only events were the start or finish of a book, the
evening baptism in the Ionian, and our meals at the house or our
favorite taverna, Agrogiali, usually accompanied by a carafe of
retsina, the local wine made with pine resin.
 &HT;    Under the influence of that good drink, with the sun gone down
leaving the houses glowing like lamps, a poem by Constantine Cavafy
came to mind.
 &HT;    ``That we've broken their statues,/that we've driven them out of
their temples,/doesn't mean at all that the gods are dead.'' The
poem ends with an ethereal figure in rapid flight, winging across
the hills: a further explanation, perhaps, for the occasional
ghostliness of the place.
 &HT;    -----
 SIDEBAR: IN A LAND HAUNTED BY A LONG HISTORY  
 LOGISTICS  
 &HT;    The airport at Kalamata, around 30 miles from Stoupa, has
flights from Athens on Olympic Airways. Travelers can also fly into
Athens, then take a bus or rent a car. There are frequent (if
rickety) buses to all major towns. A hydrofoil connects Piraeus and
Monemvasia.
 &HT;    Some of the classical sites in the Peloponnesus can be reached
on a day trip from the Mani, but an overnight stay is needed for
Epidaurus and Mycenae.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    The Peloponnesus is largely untouched by tourism, which means
there are almost no luxury hotels. Renting a house is probably the
best option. We found ours advertised in The New York Review of
Books.
 &HT;    There are also a number of small, charming and relatively
inexpensive inns. The Thomeas Travel Agency in Stoupa, (30-721)
77689; fax (30-721) 77571, can help with accommodations. A studio
for two people with bath and cooking facilities runs about $42 a
day in high season (July through September); a two-bedroom villa,
around $70 (at 360 drachmas to the dollar). Ask for Bob Barrow, an
English expatriate who published his own book about the Mani.
 &HT;    In the Mani, Limeni Village, near Areopolis, (30-733) 51111, fax
(30-733) 51182, perched on a cliff overlooking Limeni Bay, has
spectacular views. Its 35 rooms are in replicas of tower houses; a
restaurant with a terrace overlooks the sea. There is also a
swimming pool. Doubles cost $64 in July and August, with buffet
breakfast, $50 the rest of the year.
 &HT;    In Vatheia there are lodgings in restored ruins of tower houses
atop a rocky escarpment, with sweeping views down to the ocean.
Information: (30-733) 55244. A double is $44 in summer, $39 in
winter.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    Lela's Taverna in Kardamyli, (30-721) 73541, is run by a
wonderful woman (and an excellent cook) who used to be the
housekeeper for Patrick Leigh Fermor, author of the fascinating
book ``Mani.'' The tables are under a grape arbor overlooking the

THAT FLYING SENSATION

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY JERRY HAINES  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    However unfashionable it may be to admit it, I like to fly on
commuter airlines. I like to feel the water when I swim, I like to
taste the food when I eat, and I like to feel as if I'm flying when
I fly.
 &HT;    This is not a knock on the big airlines or their efficiency in
transporting billions of passengers or their safety records. But,
really, as you pass from the passenger lounge to the ``people
eater'' to the plane, and then back again at your destination, can
you really say that you have flown? Wasn't it more like being in a
series of large rooms?
 &HT;    It's just that in one of them they project movies of aerial
scenery outside the windows, and once in a while a burly stagehand
bounces the room on the director's cue of ``Looks like we're gonna
have a little turbulence, here, folks.''
 &HT;    Personally, I am delighted when I note on my itinerary the
asterisk that leads me to the footnote, ``Operated by
Somebody-You-Never-Heard-Of Airlines'' _ notwithstanding the big
corporation's logo on the plane or the masthead on the in-flight
magazine.
 &HT;    My expectations are validated when, at some stopover, I am
advised that my connecting flight is at D-78. At the very end of
the concourse, I take the escalator down, and suddenly it's as if
I'm in a different airport. There are no admirals' clubs or sports
bars here; the ceilings are low, and there is no music system. In
contrast to the gates upstairs, which are city blocks apart, the
gates here are all in one big room.
 &HT;    The boarding announcements override one another, like competing
rug merchants shouting out bargains in a bazaar. (I expect them to
try to talk me out of my destination: ``You don't want Duluth, my
friend. Evansville is right for you. I could take 30 percent off
that fare.'') There are no monitors or electronic signs. Rather,
gate agents manually insert cardboard numbers on a display board.
 &HT;    The only available food here is from vending machines. But the
food upstairs is overpriced, underseasoned and hyperfatty _ even if
it does come on a lettuce leaf. Eat your Cheez Doodles and drink
your Dr Pepper.
 &HT;    Passengers in the bullpen seats strain to sort out the
information about their respective flights. (``Did she say,
'Wichita' or 'Wichita Falls'?'') When we do board, there is little
ceremony. There is no separate loading of celebrities into first
class (indeed, the concept of first class on a commuter flight
would provoke giggles), and the entire process takes only about 10
minutes. Often the gate agent will walk us to the plane. I wonder
whether the agent is going to fly the plane, too.
 &HT;    I love these walks out to the plane. Like kindergarten kids on a
field trip, we stay close together as we follow our agent across
the Tarmac. And we're actually on the Tarmac. Little tractors and
baggage carts zip around us like deerflies as we keep a wary eye
out for approaching Airbuses. We can hear the plane engines and the
yelling of crew members. We can smell the jet fuel and feel the
prop wash. It's a sensory experience that has all but disappeared
as the airline industry strives to make air travel as
nonthreatening as possible.
 &HT;    The seating inside the plane is cramped, but at least it makes
sense to have 20 cramped seats on a small plane instead of hundreds
of them on a 747. And there are no middle seats; in fact, sometimes
a seat is both ``aisle'' and ``window.''
 &HT;    It is true that there is less space for carry-on luggage and
that we'll end up checking it. But, unlike passengers on the big
planes, I can see the guys loading it. And they can see me seeing
them. Further, when I get to where I'm going, I will just pick up
my luggage at planeside and roll through the terminal to the taxi
stand, while the people from those big planes stare at the empty,
revolving carousel and curse.
 &HT;    Many of the planes are prop jets, so that I actually can see the
engines start and the propellers begin to spin. (I wish they were
real propeller engines, though, so that starting them would sound
like that climactic moment in ``Casablanca,'' where the plane
engine starts with a whining kick.)
 &HT;    Like their counterparts on the airborne cruise ships, flight
attendants on these planes (usually only one) do the little drill
about seat belts and emergency exits and seat cushions that are
usable as flotation devices, but people actually pay attention
here. The attendant then plops into the jump seat and the plane
taxis out toward the runway.
 &HT;    As with the boarding, the taxiing seems more efficient. This
plane doesn't need help pushing back from its parking space any
more than a cabdriver needs help pulling away from the curb. The
pilot just puts down the flag on the meter and we're off for a
drive across the concrete.
 &HT;    A lot of the passengers appear to be regulars _ sales
representatives, tech reps and other itinerants who have gotten to
know the flight attendants and who kibitz with them. The plane
shudders in the backwash of a launching wide-body, then it's our
turn, and we are effortlessly airborne.
 &HT;    The flight itself is closer to the ground, and we can see the
scenery. (I had flown dozens of times into Ronald Reagan National
Airport, for example, but not until I flew there by commuter plane
was I truly impressed by Washington's memorials, the Pentagon and
those bobsledlike turns that planes must take as they approach
along the Potomac.)
 &HT;    Of course that same low altitude means that in bad weather, the
pilot can't get us above it. We are simply in it, and we can only
endure it. We macho types pretend not to be alarmed as the contents
of our soda glass hover above the glass momentarily when we hit an
air pocket.
 &HT;    ``Hey, at Busch Gardens you'd have to pay 10 bucks for a ride
like this,'' we joke (and then resume mumbling prayers). I try to
think of it as my Authentic Flying Experience. Real mashed potatoes
have lumps; real flying has bumps.
 &HT;    Soon we sense the impending landing (in our ears --
pressurization sometimes is a scarce commodity), and we return our
seat backs to their full upright position (as opposed to the
91-degree position we used for relaxing).
 &HT;    We're down quickly, the pilot does that little prop-reversal
thing that halts the plane on a dime, and we chug over toward the
terminal, where we stop several yards from the building. I expect
the pilot to caution, ``Now, everyone remember where we parked.''
 &HT;    I wonder whether the pilots, flight attendants and gate agents
are happy here in the farm club. Do the pilots dream of setting
down a 747 at Narita or Charles de Gaulle or Leonardo da Vinci? Do
the flight attendants look enviously toward the big ships that have
entire teams to do all of the things that one person does on a
commuter flight? Do the gate agents aspire to a life upstairs where
one might see the sun and buy $6 pizza slices?
 &HT;    I surely hope not. I hope they enjoy it as much as I do. Now if
they'd only let me sit up front with the pilots.

 (Color slide included.) 
 By ADELE MALOTT 
 Condensed from The Mature Traveler Newsletter 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 CORRECTION  
 &HT;    A recent Mature Traveler column reported that Hilton's Senior
HHonors program has been extended to include Doubletree, Hampton,
Homewood Suites and Embassy Suites. This is incorrect. The Senior
HHonors membership program for those ages 60 and older is valid
only at Hiltons and Conrad International Hotels. For more details,
call (800) 432-3600, or visit www.hilton.com on the Web.
 &HT;    -----
 &HT;    I love to hear from readers _ especially when their questions
are ones that will benefit many mature travelers.
 &HT;    Here's a selection of questions that recently crossed my desk.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR TMT:  
 &HT;    Your book, ``The Mature Traveler's Book of Deals,'' refers to
the French Carte Vermeil railroad pass, but I can't find any other
references to it. What can you tell me about it? _ Tom Lowell, San
Antonio, Texas
 &HT;    
 &HT;    DEAR MR. LOWELL:  
 &HT;    It's probably a bit hard to find since it has a new name, Carte
Senior, and it replaces the two earlier Carte Vermeil travel cards.
Travelers ages 60 and older can buy a Carte Senior for 290 francs _
the equivalent of about $42 U.S. _ at a French railway station to
get reductions of up to 50 percent off standard rail prices. The
pass is good for a year.
 &HT;    Carte Senior holders also are entitled to 30 percent off the
standard price for all train trips in 23 European countries that
use the Rail Europe Senior plan.
 &HT;    You will need to bring an identity photo in addition to your
passport when applying for a Carte Senior pass at the ticket
office. The Web site www.sncf.fr gives some background but does not
reveal a ticket price until you have made a reservation.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR TMT:  
 &HT;    I am planning a round-trip train ride to San Diego, Calif., in
August. Please help me with information about train travel. _ Tom
Ladner, Levittown, Penn.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR MR. LEVITTOWN  
 &HT;    First, call Amtrak, (800) 872-7245, to see about travel dates
and fares. Amtrak discounts its railfares by 15 percent for those
ages 62 or older. However, the fare you pay depends on how full the
train is.
 &HT;    For example, when I recently checked with Amtrak, senior fares
for a chair ticket from your area to San Diego ranged from $356.50
to $898 _ and the latter price was for a nearly full train. Of
course, a compartment costs more.
 &HT;    Here are two possible routes:
 &HT;    Take the Amtrak Three Rivers from Trenton, N.J., to Chicago,
where you will transfer to the California Zephyr, which will take
you via Denver to Oakland. There you will board the Coast Starlight
to travel along the California coast to Los Angeles, where you will
get on the San Diegan for the last leg of the trip.
 &HT;    Or, take the Nutmeg to New York, where you will transfer to the
Three Rivers to go to Chicago. In Chicago, you will board the
Southwest Chief, which travels cross country via Albuquerque, N.M.,
to Fullerton, a Los Angeles suburb, where you will board the San
Diegan.
 &HT;    For more information, call the San Diego Convention and Visitors
Bureau at (619) 232-3101.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR TMT: 
 &HT;    My wife and I have some travel questions that we hope you can
answer:
 &HT;    1) Whom should we contact to arrange traveling between England
and France by train?
 &HT;    2) What is the procedure for obtaining a National Parks Golden
Age Passport?
 &HT;    _ A.E. Lockert, Jr. Nashville, Tenn.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR MR. LOCKERT:  
 &HT;    1) To book travel on Eurostar (under the English Channel),
contact your travel agent or Rail Europe, which is the North
American supplier of European rail products. Call (800) 438-7245,
or www.raileurope.com on the Web.
 &HT;    2) If you are 62 or older you can buy a lifetime Golden Age
Passport for $10. Passports are available at any national park, or
you can contact the National Park Service, P.O. Box 37127,
Washington, D.C. 20013; www.nps.gov.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE.)
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR TMT:  
 &HT;    To whom should I write to get a travel itinerary for Helen, Ga.?
Your help is greatly appreciated.
 &HT;    _ Ethel Spade, West Palm Beach, Fla.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR MRS. SPADE:  
 &HT;    First call your travel agent and ask about motorcoach companies
that plan trips to Helen. Or ask the agent if he/she knows a travel
club or church group going to Helen that you could call.
 &HT;    If the travel agent can't help, I would contact information
centers and ask which motorcoach companies include a Helen
itinerary.
 &HT;    Try contacting:
 &HT;    _ Alpine Helen-White County Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau, P.O.
Box 730, Helen, Ga. 30545; (706) 878-2181.
 &HT;    _ Helen Welcome Center, City Hall - Chattahoochee St., Helen,
Ga. 30545; (706) 878-2521.
 &HT;    _ The Georgia Tourist Division, (404) 656-3595.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE.)
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR TMT: 
 &HT;    I read your column every Sunday and enjoy it very much. But I
have a suggestion: In future articles, could you give the distances
from major airports to town centers and include if public transport
is available? Many of us prefer not to rent cars.
 &HT;    One of your columns reads, ``Banff is easily accessible via
90-minute drive from Calgary airport!'' A 20-minute trip by cab,
bus or shuttle is a more reasonable distance. _ John Lancaster,
Doylestown, PA.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR MR. LANCASTER:  
 &HT;    I will be happy to work airport/city center information into
future articles when it is appropriate. The handy reference book
``Salk International's Airport Transit Guide'' is also a great
help. For a current copy of the book, call Magellan's at (800)
962-4943. The price is $9.95 and includes shipping and handling.
 &HT;    The guide gives the kind of information you want and includes
average prices for shuttles and cabs as well as where to get them
and which routes are recommended.
 &HT;    Regarding the Banff to Calgary transfer: There are shuttles that
run regularly between the two points, giving you a chance to relax
and enjoy the scenery.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR TMT:  
 &HT;    My sister and I are planning a trip to New York to visit Ellis
Island to see our parents' names are on the immigrants' wall. We
want an escorted tour that lasts about three days. We'd like to be
escorted from the airport to our hotel and then to Battery Park,
etc. The only travel company I have located includes four extra
days in New York. Do you know of any of short length? _ Eileen
Wozneski, Palm City, Fla.
 &HT;    
 &HT;     DEAR MS. WOZNESKI: 
 &HT;    I recommend that you work with Gray Line of New York, (800)
669-0051. Gray Line does offer airport transfers from each airport
to most hotels in Manhattan for rates ranging from $16 to $19 per
person.
 &HT;    And Gray Line has a number of escorted tours within the city.
Several incorporate visits to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis
Island with other attractions.
 &HT;    For senior travelers, I always recommend the Big Apple Greeters,
(212) 669-2896. It's not a tour, but is made up of local volunteers
who showcase those parts of New York they know best.
 &HT;    The Greeters prefer to be contacted a minimum of 10 days before
any planned trip so they can match your needs with the available
volunteers' specialities.
 &HT;

 By WILLIAM T. TOMICKI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;     Q:  My wife and I are headed to Melbourne, Australia. Can you
recommend a culinary hot spot there?
 &HT;     A:  You couldn't find a more popular restaurant than the sleek
Radii at the Park Hyatt Melbourne, where chef Paul Wilson is
earning rave reviews.
 &HT;    This vibrant, multilevel experience with an open kitchen has a
wood-fired oven, bar and cigar lounge. Chef Wilson prepares what he
calls ``modern cuisine'' using quality produce true to its natural
flavor.
 &HT;    This is exciting food of superb quality. Expect dishes such as
scallops in a citrus beurre blanc; cassoulet of blue eye and clams;
and sauternes custard. There's also rotisseried leg of lamb,
risotto, roasted trout, grilled chicken and duck. The menu is
brave. Wines are fairly priced at Radii and service is impeccable.
All dishes are designed to share. Desserts are extravagant.
 &HT;    For more information, call 9224-1211.
 &HT;     Q:  I am planning a three-week trip to China in September. I am
having trouble finding anyone who understands the exchange rates
and how to do it. I am aware that you can bring a limited amount of
money in or out, but where do you get it? I am trying to avoid long
lines and hassles at the airport, and my bank tells me they do not
trade in this currency. Help!
 &HT;     : . Regarding the pre-purchase of Chinese currency, there are
two official names for the currency, renminbi (RMB) and kuai.
 &HT;    Our sources at Export International Currency Express do not
advise on pre-purchasing large amounts of RMB because the rate is
not very favorable compared to exchanging in China. The CITIC bank
in Beijing, on Jiangguomenwai Street, is very efficient.
 &HT;    However, Export International Currency Exchange can arrange for
a smaller amount to be made in advance to hold you over until you
can reach a proper bank. You can contact them at (888) 278-6628.
Best wishes for a wonderful trip through China.
 &HT;     : . My husband and I are looking for a quick getaway to the
Arizona desert. Do you know of any value-priced packages at nicer
resorts?
 &HT;     A:  The Royal Palms Hotel and Casitas is offering a variety of
well-priced packages for those seeking some rest and relaxation in
the desert. The Phoenix property is managed by Destination Hotels
and Resorts and is part of a collection of distinctive upscale
hotels and resorts known for their luxurious standards and
exceptional recreational opportunities.
 &HT;    The Royal Romance package, which costs $279 for two days and one
night, includes Plaza Suite accommodation and sensual amenities
such as champagne and chocolate-covered strawberries.
 &HT;    The Royal Tee, which starts at $269 for two days and one night,
includes daily breakfast and a round of golf at one of several top
golf courses in the area.
 &HT;    The Royal Treatment, $399 for two days and one night, includes
Plaza suite accommodation, and an in-room or cabana massage for
each guest, as well as complimentary use of the fitness center.
 &HT;    For those looking for accommodations only, the Royal Palms is
offering a summer promotional rate of $149 per room, per night. For
reservations or more information, call (800) 672-6011.
 &HT;     Q:  I've been to Africa once before, but I felt very much like
a tourist the entire time and left feeling unsatisfied. I'd like to
try again, but I really want to get a feel for the various local
cultures and really experience Africa. Any suggestions?
 &HT;     A:  The best way to experience local culture anywhere is to

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Still haven't planned a summer family getaway?
 &HT;    Then get on the Web. There are some great sites out there that
are fast, efficient and can help save money. Some can help reveal a
cheaper airfare or car-rental deal. Others can aid in unearthing
the perfect hotel or inn. So take these steps to get the best
vacation value this summer.
 &HT;    For those who can't decide between a cottage by shore, a
national park visit, or a trip to Florida, do a little research.
Disney's site, Family.com (www.family.com), has vacation advice of
all kinds, helping travelers plan trips by location and by type.
 &HT;    Anyone looking for an inexpensive family restaurant in
Yellowstone National Park, a bed &AMP; breakfast in Vermont or a hotel
in Chicago that will accept the family dog should go to Fodor's
(www.fodors.com), the Web site of the famed guidebooks. It's
well-organized, detailed and opinionated.
 &HT;    Also have a look at Arthur Frommer's Budget Travel
(www.frommers.com), where there is loads of information about
underrated and inexpensive places such as Portugal and Greece.
 &HT;    Frommer and his staff seek out low-cost ways to take vacations
that just seem expensive, like beach holidays. They also look for
unusual and cost-saving options, such as volunteer vacations with
the Sierra Club.
 &HT;    Fodors travel guides are connected to Concierge.com
(www.concierge.com), the Web site of Conde Nast publications, a
good resource for bed &AMP; breakfasts, resort hotels and lakeside
retreats. For those who want a peek at more luxurious vacations,
``Travel + Leisure''s Web site (www.pathfinder.com/travel/TL) has
the current issue and back issues available through a good search
engine.
 &HT;    If a vacation paradise must include sand and palm trees,
Pleasant Hawaiian Holidays (www.pleasanthawaian.com) are
discounters who can put together a range of well-priced
air/hotel/transfer deals to the islands, utilizing a large stock of
hotels and condos. Their sister company, Pleasant Mexico Holidays,
can do the same south of the border.
 &HT;    For the world beyond, check out Time Out (www.timeout.com),
which is like going online with an English accent. This site takes
the best of Time Out's city guides and city listing magazines and
puts them on the web.
 &HT;    Rough Guides (http://travel.roughguides.com) are written with
the independent traveler in mind and Lonely Planet
(www.lonelyplanet.com) set the standards for such travel. Then look
at BootsnAll.com (http://216.110.36.72/cgi-bin/gt/index.shtml),
which refers to itself as ``The Ultimate Resource for the
Independent Traveller,'' with a host of first-person stories by
young people traveling cheaply around the world.
 &HT;    The Europe-bound should head to Rail Europe's site
(www.raileurope.com), a godsend for anyone who has tried to plan a
rail journey through Europe. This site has schedules and fares for
point-to-point train fares, Eurailpasses, multi-country passes,
single country passes and rail 'n' drive passes. They also offer
Eurostar tickets from London to Brussels or Paris.
 &HT;    For getaways to American cities, check out discount hotel
brokers like Quikbook (www.quikbook.com) and Hotel Reservations
Network (www.180096hotel.com). Figure on discounts from 15 percent
to 40 percent off published rates in major city hotels, based on
availability, of course.
 &HT;    Once the hotel is booked, have a look at CultureFinder.com
(www.culturefinder.com), which has thousands of listings for opera,
ballet or theater performances in dozens of cities around the
country. In some cases, event tickets can be ordered online. Both
Digitalcity (www.digitalcity.com) and Citysearch.com
(www.citysearch.com) have a city-by-city list of restaurants and
shops, as well as sightseeing, arts and other entertainment. These
sites can make a visitor feel like local.
 &HT;    Biking, hiking and multisport vacations with the family are a
terrific way to spend a week or two outdoors with like-minded
families. But it can be daunting to sort through and evaluate
hundreds of similar-sounding adventure companies. So visit G.O.R.P.
(www.gorp.com), an acronym for the Great Outdoor Recreation Pages,
which has adventure travel stories and links to dozens of
outfitters who offer hiking, biking, kayaking and white water
rafting trips.
 &HT;    For those who have to fly, check out upcoming deals and sales on
the Web sites of American Airlines (www.aa.com), Continental
(www.flycontinental.com), United Airlines (www.ual.com), Delta
(www.delta-air.com), TWA (www.twa.com), USAirways
(www.usairways.com) and Northwest (www.flynwa.com).
 &HT;    Both Expedia.com (www.expedia.com) and Travelocity
(www.travelocity.com) have fast and sophisticated fare-finders.
They also offer short-term deals, sale fares and specials. It's
relatively quick and easy to book an entire vacation on these
sites, from airline seats to hotel rooms and car rentals. But
price-sensitive shoppers should also take a look at Lowestfare.com
(www.lowestfare.com), 1Travel.com (www.onetravel.com) and
Cheaptickets.com (www.cheaptickets.com).
 &HT;    As for specialized tickets, such as around-the-world tickets and
discounted business class tickets, look at TicketPlanet.com
(www.ticketplanet.com). Finally, for those with a yen to go cheaply
to Japan, China or other Asian destinations, Chisholm Travel
(www.chisholmair.net) is the best source.

VACATION LEAVES UNWELCOME LEGACY
</HEADLINE>
  By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa , Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   My malady didn't hit until the return trip. Over there I was
unfazed, body and brain automatically tuned into European time.
Over there it was my husband staring into the TV at 3 a.m.,
watching a French documentary on fish.
</P>
<P>
   Now he sleeps and I wander the house like an intruder, bumping
into walls, rebuffed by my own pillow. Goodnight moon. Goodnight
chair. Hello strange zombie woman. It is 2:30 in the morning, and
lack of sleep is my new obsession.
</P>
<P>
   Is this the price for getting away for three weeks and crossing
too many time zones? Is this what our mothers meant by burning the
candle at both ends?
</P>
<P>
   In the past weeks I have fallen asleep to the high-pitched whine
of motor scooters and screeches from soccer fans. Here, where all
is calm under a silk cover of fog, I am bejangled. My brain is
saying, ``Hey mama, let's party.''
</P>
<P>
   Le lag from the jet is not a pretty creature. She looks to be
roughly 109. Her eyelids are heavy, but her eyes dart back and
forth, perhaps scanning for one more museum, one last cute little
cafe. Look into those eyes, if you dare. They resemble that
delicacy of central France, poached eggs in red wine sauce.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the refreshed image I was hoping to come home with.
</P>
<P>
   If science can figure out how cells combine to make a person
crave spinach and want to play the piano, why can't it let us fly
around the world and come back with the same brain attached to the
same body? The legs ache, the throat burns, the brain thinks it's
time for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Don't advise melatonin. It gives me weird dreams. Of course,
this is pretty weird reality.
</P>
<P>
   It's good to be home. Home is where the heart is, where the cat
is brooding, where the tomato crop appears doomed and where the
phone company has delivered equipment nobody ordered. But one must
slumber first to cope with these things.
</P>
<P>
   Jet lag is as common a travel affliction as poison oak and
sunburn. I know this because I have been looking up information on
the Internet, which is the only number I dare to dial in the middle
of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendants suffer from it, you know. You would think
they'd have learned all the tricks. I always envy them stretched
out behind their curtained-off seats while we wrap our knees into
our armpits for 11 hours, but they, too, complain of altered
states.
</P>
<P>
   Some high-flying business executives aren't allowed to sign
contracts the first 24 hours after landing because of potential
brain impairment.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing you can't sleep creates the same anxiety I get while
waiting to give a speech. I have tried doing yoga breaths, drinking
mint tea. I have thought kind thoughts. I have banished all care.
Aargh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a long flight,'' said the attendant, placing
four tiny drink bottles of golden liquid in front of us somewhere
off the coast of England and before Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding alcohol while flying will help to prevent jet lag, they
say. However, many people who pay lots of money to fly think they
deserve at least one celebratory drink. After all, we're on
vacation. It is also easier to get alcohol than water on a plane.
You can bring your own, of course, but how many quart bottles can
you lug on board?
</P>
<P>
   No coffee, either, they warn. But the time I tried flying
without any coffee at all I was punished the next day with a
caffeine withdrawal headache.
</P>
<P>
   Supposedly you get less jet lag flying east to west, although
some say just the opposite. You are also less prone if you fly in
daylight and if you're middle-aged or older. Bingo on all the
above, but here I am with my motor running.
</P>
<P>
   NASA says you need one day of recovery for every time zone
you've crossed. That gives me until the end of next week.
</P>
<P>
   Travel guru Rick Steves says to take two days before traveling
and just relax. Leave for a flight well-rested. Try to have two
orderly and peaceful days before taking off. What a kidder, that
Rick.
</P>
<P>
   Most people I know maximize their vacation time by working up
until the day they leave and going back to work the day after they
get home. It is, however, one of my 2:30 a.m. vows. Next time I
will come home one day early simply to catch up on sleep.
</P>
<P>
   No, I won't.
</P>
<P>
   That's the other thing about jet lag. Like childbirth, you
forget the inconvenience, which allows for repeats.
</P>
<P>
   As we filed off the plane and into the airport, we looked like
detainees, shuffling in swollen feet toward the baggage carousel.
An animated group was coming our way. They were smiling and
fresh-faced. Their hair was combed and they had crisp boarding
passes in hand, on their way to fun and adventure, with hours to go
before they turned into aliens. I envied them.

 c.2000 Sara Mosle  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am a volunteer. For three years, I taught public school in New
York City, and since 1994, the summer after my last third-grade
class, I have served as an unofficial mentor to the families of
four of my former students - Adam and James, Jaber (and his younger
brother, Lloyd), Keemy (and his older siblings, Clara, Elizabeth
and Angelo) and Burger, plus a few of their friends. At any given
time, ``the group,'' as we have all come to call it, has numbered
from 6 to 12 kids, a few of them Dominican, the rest of them black.
I am 36 and white.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, we have gone ice skating, bowling, to movies, to
museums and on the occasional overnight trip (to Washington, the
east end of Long Island) and have generally hung out. I have been
on hand for happy moments (the 100th birthday of Jaber's
great-great-grandmother) and sad ones (his grandfather's funeral).
When I met ``my'' kids, they were 7 and 8 years old, smaller than I
am, and liked to hold my hand when we crossed the street. Now they
are 15 and 16, nearly all are in high school and they hulk over me
in puffy parkas or with long legs and gangly arms protruding out of
shorts and tank tops. Not one of them would be caught dead holding
my hand.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, politicians and civic leaders have been
looking to volunteers like me to take over the government's role in
providing vital services to the poor. Although the movement
arguably began in 1988 with the candidate George Bush's invocation
of ``a thousand points of light'' as a response to Reagan-era
cutbacks in social spending, it has been embraced by the current
Democratic administration, which has continued those cutbacks, and
culminated in the 1997 President's Summit for America's Future in
Philadelphia, where President Clinton and Gen. Colin Powell touted
the power of volunteerism.
</P>
<P>
   Now George W. Bush has picked up his father's theme of ``a
kinder, gentler'' America by pushing ``charitable choice'' _ the
provision in the 1996 welfare reform bill that allows faith-based
organizations to contract with government to provide social
services to the poor. (Al Gore supports it, too, though less
vigorously.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Compassionate conservatives'' would probably claim that I am
the kind of ``caring adult'' who can transform the lives of
disadvantaged kids more effectively than any government program.
I'm all for volunteering, but I would disagree. While I don't doubt
that I have had some positive effects on my kids' lives _ studies
show that mentoring can reduce dropout rates and drug use among
teen-agers _ they have mostly been of the ``boosting self-esteem''
variety that conservatives, in other contexts, usually disdain.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, I'm not a very good volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   To work, mentoring has to be performed consistently, over a
sustained period of time and preferably one on one. For the first
couple of years, I saw my kids as often as twice a week. But now
I'm lucky if I see them once a month, and I almost never see them
individually. In their lives, I'm less a caring adult than a random
one. And my failure is representative.
</P>
<P>
   Although 55 percent of Americans reported that they volunteered
at some point in 1998 _ a 7 percent rise over 1995 _ this jump does
little more than recover ground that was lost in the early 1990s
and represents just a 1 percent increase over 1989. Moreover, the
total number of hours that people are giving has actually declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new trend,'' says Sara Melendez, the president of
Independent Sector, which compiled this data. ``People are
volunteering, but when they do, it's more of a one-shot deal _ half
a day one Saturday, instead of once a week for x number of weeks.''
Overall, Americans donated 400 million fewer hours in 1998 than
they did in 1995. Consequently, while Powell has made recruiting
100,000 new mentors a top priority of America's Promise, his
volunteer outfit, there is little evidence that people are
sufficiently answering his call.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, for instance, Big Brothers/Big Sisters receives
just 4,000 inquiries each year from potential mentors. Of these,
two-thirds never follow up once they learn they have to commit to
seeing their kids at least twice a month. Another 700 lose interest
after the initial training session or are eliminated through the
program's rigorous screening process. Only 600 people ever become
mentors _ this in a city with more than one million schoolchildren
_ and nationally, the program has a waiting list of some 50,000
kids. To help nonprofits cope with this new unreliable work force,
groups like Impact Online and New York Cares have sprung up that
act like temp agencies, matching the interests (and busy schedules)
of what might be called the impulse volunteer _ someone with an
urge to give but only a few hours to kill _ with openings, arranged
by time slot and geographical location.
</P>
<P>
   But this Filofax approach to giving often robs volunteerism of
the very thing that was supposed to recommend it over government in
the first place _ namely, the personal connection that develops
when you regularly visit, say, the same homebound AIDS patient. And
in a volunteer's market, not every need has a buyer. ``People will
come in and do a project _ a school painting, a school wiring _ and
think they've done a good service and go away,'' says Paul Clolery,
editor of The NonProfit Times. ``But it's not the type of
traditional, week-in and week-out volunteering that a lot of
organizations really need.''
</P>
<P>
   No case perhaps better illustrates how idealism has run amok
than that of Bank of America, which under the rubric of
``volunteerism'' encouraged its employees in San Francisco to
``adopt an ATM'' _ mentoring it, so to speak, by visiting it
regularly, sprucing up its surroundings, wiping away the little
smudges from its face _ until the California labor commissioner
ruled that the company had violated labor laws by trying to get its
employees to work without pay.
</P>
<P>
   The experience of Meals on Wheels in Dallas is typical. It can't
find enough volunteers to commit to even a few hours a month to
help deliver meals to the city's elderly shut-ins. ``People can't
get away during the middle of the day,'' says Helen Bruant, the
program's director. ``So, they ask, 'Why don't you deliver in the
evenings?' Well, we looked at that. But for a lot of our clients,
this is their only meal. They eat half at lunch and save the other
half for dinner. Plus, it's not good for the elderly to eat a big
meal at the end of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, the program must hire 30 percent of its drivers. Even
paying people, Bruant cannot find enough help. ``We can't compete
with McDonald's,'' she says. ``It can be draining working with the
elderly. A lot of people would prefer to flip burgers.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, if anything, the need is increasing. ``The aged population
has grown by leaps and bounds in the last decade,'' Bruant says,
``but giving and government financing haven't increased.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, according to a study by the U.S. Conference of Mayors
released in December, requests for emergency food and housing have
climbed at their steepest rate since the early 1990s. As a result,
the heads of some of the most reputable nonprofits _ the United
Way, the Salvation Army, Catholic Charities _ have reported that
they can't keep up with rising demand for their services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having to turn people away, or ration portions, to
stretch supplies,'' says Deborah Leff, the president of America's
Second Harvest, the nation's largest network of soup kitchens. And
while charitable giving is up sharply, the growth has not kept pace
with reductions in government aid to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have replaced some of it with volunteering, some of it
with cash, but not all of it,'' says Richard Steinberg, a professor
of economics at the joint campus of Indiana and Purdue Universities
in Indianapolis. He estimates that for every dollar of assistance
that's cut, charitable organizations can recoup at most a third.
</P>
<P>
   As someone who once worked in the New York public school system,
I am not inured to the problems of government bureaucracy. I have
not forgotten the asbestos crisis (which sealed my own classroom),
the idiocy of the custodians' contract, the mind-numbing hours I
spent at the Board of Education trying to get someone, anyone, to
answer a straightforward question about licensing.
</P>
<P>
   But what's so odd about the current volunteer movement is how
the broad claims often made on its behalf run counter to the
on-the-ground testimony of those, like Bruant, who actually do the
hard work of ministering to the poor. Compared with someone like
her, of course, I am pathetic. Still, in the words of a protester's
placard at the volunteer summit, I've ``volunteered enough to know
volunteering isn't enough.'' As a substitute for the social safety
net, I am as inefficient, indifferent and arbitrary as any
government program. The problem isn't with volunteering, but with
what we're asking it to do.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Tipping Point,'' Malcolm Gladwell's book about social
epidemics, he cites an experiment devised by two Princeton
psychologists to test why people give. The experimenters met
individually with a group of seminarians and asked them to prepare
a short talk. Some were asked to discuss the parable of the Good
Samaritan. Others were given a more neutral topic. Then, just as
they were about to leave for their presentations, they were told
either that they were running late or had a few minutes to spare.
</P>
<P>
   On the way, the seminarians would encounter a man slumped in an
alleyway, coughing and groaning in obvious distress. The idea was
to see who would stop and help. Invariably, people assume that
those who were asked to talk about the Good Samaritan were the most
likely to assist the man. In fact, the only factor that influenced
the outcome was time. Among those who thought they were in a hurry,
only 10 percent stopped to help. Among those with extra time, 63
percent stopped. As Gladwell concludes, context, far more than
conviction, influences behavior.
</P>
<P>
   One obvious reason for the decline in volunteering is that
Americans are working harder. ``With the rise of the two-income
family,'' Paul Clolery says, ``the traditional volunteer who stayed
at home with the kids no longer exists.'' According to one study,
middle-class parents now punch the clock 335 hours more each year _
that's eight solid workweeks _ than they did in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how you ask people who are working 50-, 60-hour
weeks, who already have children and elderly parents to care for,
to volunteer on a more regular basis,'' Sara Melendez says. ``The
rhetoric about volunteering hasn't caught up with the reality of
people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 1995 and 1997, for example, I cut back the amount of
time I saw my kids by three-fourths, to about once a month. The
reason wasn't that in 1995 I was a good person and in 1997 I was a
bad one. Rather, in 1995 I had a flexible job with a lot of
downtime, and in 1997 I took a full-time job as an editor and often
worked into the evening or on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Before I made the shift, I began to look for an exit out of my
kids' lives. At one point, I was approached about a job in
Washington and figured that was how my mentoring would end: I would
leave the city. But the opportunity fell through. I eventually
decided I would get my four original students into a good, small
junior high. (I also helped Angelo get into a good high school.)
The younger siblings, I figured, could then follow suit. My idea
was not to improve the city's schools systematically _ my children
would almost certainly take the places of other poor, equally
deserving students _ but to pass the kids off, into new caring
hands, like batons.
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk about children in this country, we do very
little for them _ or their families. What my kids really need, I
can't give them: better housing, less crowded schools, access to
affordable health care, a less punitive juvenile justice system,
and for their parents, better child care (so they can work without
leaving their kids unattended) and a living wage. Even the
churches, in whose name the claims of volunteering are often made,
have begun to protest.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a surprisingly large and diverse coalition of
religious leaders _ from the conservative National Association of
Evangelicals to the liberal U.S. Catholic Conference _ came
together in Washington to inaugurate a new group, Call to Renewal,
to insist that government do more to fight poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since welfare reform passed, all these problems have been
dumped at churches' feet,'' says the Rev. Jim Wallis, one of the
organization's founders. ``But we can't do it all.'' As it stands,
the government isn't even doing what it said it would.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that hunger and homelessness are on the rise is that
many states, including New York, have prevented even the deserving
working poor from receiving basic benefits, like health care and
food stamps, to which they are legally entitled. Nationwide, a
million people have lost Medicaid benefits and are now uninsured.
As a result, many working families are worse off financially than
they were under the old system.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota, by contrast, has offered ample assistance _ cash
allowances to supplement income, job training, more opportunities
for health and child care _ in addition to requiring that welfare
recipients work. The approach hasn't been cheap, but the results,
according to a widely praised study released in June, have been
remarkable: not only have poverty and homelessness declined but the
marriage rate has also risen, domestic abuse is down, truancy rates
have fallen and children are doing better in school.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to help kids, in short, is not to recruit strangers
to take the place of parents, but to help those _ their families
and teachers _ who are already in the best position to help them.
That's not to say that volunteering has no value. But it doesn't
offer a systematic solution to entrenched problems like hunger,
poverty or homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   I now live in Texas, but I am not happy to have abandoned my
kids. While I would be lying if I said I didn't sometimes still
wish that my kids' lives had never become linked to mine, in truth,
when I try to imagine my life without them in it, I can't.

   SEX SELLS
</P>
<P>
   GUINEVERE TURNER (co-screenwriter, actress, ``American
Psycho''): People want to see R movies, adults and children alike,
and an easy way to get an R rating is to have sex scenes or nudity.
We'd be fooling ourselves if we didn't think teen-agers wanted to
see sex. And in creating the taboo, we create frenzy around it.
</P>
<P>
   JOHN PAPSIDERA (casting director): There were two distinct
moments that I remember when I sat in a crowded movie theater that
was just buzzing with anticipation. One was ``The Full Monty'' and
the other was ``Basic Instinct,'' which Paul Verhoeven did before
``Showgirls.'' And it felt like the audience was there because they
thought, Oooh, isn't this taboo? It was as if somebody suddenly
said it's OK for you to go see nudity in a film.
</P>
<P>
   MICHAEL CRISTOFER (director, ``Gia,'' screenwriter): In ``Basic
Instinct,'' the nudity helped tell us who that character was _ a
woman who used her sexuality to manipulate. If it had not been that
interesting a character and a story, Sharon Stone could have walked
around naked for an hour and 48 minutes and it would not have made
her a star.
</P>
<P>
   MARC NORMAN (co-screenwriter, ``Shakespeare in Love''): When I
think of ``Showgirls'' and ``Basic Instinct,'' the distinction is
in the excellence of the film. ``Showgirls'' was a turkey, and the
nudity meant nothing to the box office. ``Basic Instinct'' was a
crackling good story, and on top of that, everybody heard you could
see Sharon Stone's ya-ya. In ``Shakespeare in Love,'' there's a
tease when Shakespeare is unwrapping the binding over Gwyneth
Paltrow's chest, and she's about to be naked, then later on you do
see her breasts. We could have optically enlarged the shot so that
her breasts were out of the frame. There was some discussion that
without the nudity it would get a PG, so people could bring younger
children, but it never came to a vote. We didn't feel it was worth
second-guessing the creative decision for the marketing decision.
And the film ended up making $100 million in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   PAPSIDERA: Look at what just happened with Jessica Biel. She was
in ``Ulee's Gold,'' and she was fabulous, but, you know, very few
people saw that film, and ``Seventh Heaven,'' her TV show, is so
sweet and syrupy, she really passed under the radar for a lot of
years. So she did the cover of Gear magazine semi-naked. It was an
attention-getting moment, and it catapulted her career.
</P>
<P>
   GLENN RIGBERG (manager, Rigberg, Roberts &AMP; Rugolo): What's so
interesting is when you wander around the agencies and sets in
Hollywood right now, there's this special magazine insert called
the Maxim 100, which is pictures of scantily clad models and
actresses. And I swear to God, it's being used in Hollywood to help
cast movies.
</P>
<P>
   TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING?
</P>
<P>
   MARK GILL (president, Miramax Los Angeles): If you're writing
``Shakespeare in Love'' or ``Good Will Hunting,'' you are trying to
reach an audience that is judgmental about emotional delivery and
character development. With a Freddie Prinze Jr. movie, even though
the girls in the test audience scream when he takes his shirt off,
you try not to have them be too sexy for a PG-13, because you won't
get the 8- to 12-year-olds. By contrast, Miramax has a spoof of the
``Scream'' movies called ``Scary Movie'' coming out this summer.
There's nudity in it that puts it right up against the edge of
NC-17. And we need to be, because the whole point is to make a lot
of fun of all of those ridiculous ``sexy girl in jeopardy''
stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   CRISTOFER: Any studio with any brains knows that movies that
come on strong with nudity, like ``Showgirls,'' are threatening to
the young male audience _ which is their primary target. It places
a huge responsibility on their shoulders to know more about sex
than they do.
</P>
<P>
   JOAN CHEN (director, ``Autumn in New York,'' actress): With
``Autumn in New York,'' there was a scene where Winona Ryder was to
appear naked. It would've been her first time. They must have
thought it would be a draw, otherwise they wouldn't have asked her
to sign this agreement. And she had some concerns, but she trusted
that as I'm a female I wouldn't exploit her and would make sure it
was beautiful. The scene was shot through glass in more of an
abstract than a real way. Still, at test screenings, people
voluntarily wrote that they didn't want to see the nudity.
</P>
<P>
   MEN VS. WOMEN
</P>
<P>
   TURNER: The female body always has been used for
entertainment-slash-abuse. I loved how in ``American Psycho'' Mary
put a lot of gratuitous shots of Christian Bale's body, these long,
lingering shower scenes, completely shot the way women are done in
movies. And there were scenes in which he's looking at himself in
the mirror while having sex that had to be cut in order to avoid an
NC-17 rating. I take personal offense with that, since I'm nude in
a three-way with a hooker later in the movie and I get brutally
murdered and that was just fine with the censors.
</P>
<P>
   CRISTOFER: It's part of the sexist nature of our business. We
don't expect Al Pacino or Robert De Niro lying across a beach in a
pair of Speedos with a cocktail in his hand trying to be seductive.
But a great actress we do expect to lie out as naked as possible,
and the only reason she should be in a movie is because we want to
have sex with her.
</P>
<P>
   GILL: There was a really fascinating exception to that recently,
the Leelee Sobieski film ``Here on Earth,'' which was all about
Chris Klein running around, bronzed, with his shirt off. It was the
sort of parading that actresses are expected to do routinely.
</P>
<P>
   PAPSIDERA: That seems to be an emerging trend in teen films. In
``Varsity Blues,'' Scott Caan was naked except for a cowboy hat and
boots, whereas one of the female stars, Ali Larter, wore a
less-revealing bikini made out of whipped cream.
</P>
<P>
   CRISTOFER: That's kind of refreshing, even if it means making
male nudity humorous and humiliating. And then there are actors
like Ewan McGregor where there's hardly a movie where he doesn't
show everything.
</P>
<P>
   WHEN TO GET NAKED (OR NOT)
</P>
<P>
   RIGBERG: In representing actresses, you always have to ask,
``Will you do nudity or are you totally against it?'' and the
answer always seems to be, ``Well, in the right circumstance,'' and
then I'll name a circumstance, and they'll say, ``Well, no, but
maybe for Martin Scorsese.'' You also need to discuss the
difference between sexual conduct and nudity, because some
actresses won't do a sex scene, but they'll be topless. Even so,
when the director who you've been worshiping during the whole
making of the movie says: ``I kind of want to do it like this. Do
you mind?'' it puts that performer, especially an unknown, on the
spot. That's when you get the call _ ``Do I have to? Do I have
to?''
</P>
<P>
   BILL VELORIC (agent, Stone Manners Talent Agency): I've run into
a number of things that were presented as the right situation and
totally became the wrong situation. I just advised someone who
wasn't willing to do anything other than upper-frontal nudity not
to agree to nudity. Consequently, her part got whittled down, and
one of the most valuable scenes in the movie was given to someone
else.
</P>
<P>
   RIGBERG: On the other hand, nudity can put an actress back on
the map. I represent Tatum O'Neal, and I recently sent her a script
based on Linda Lovelace. But would the mother of an 14-year-old, a
12-year-old and a 9-year-old play this porn star where she would
have to be nude in it? At first she called me up and said, ``Are
you out of your mind?'' And after, she read it and took it
seriously and she said, ``Well, I could never let my kids see this,
but I'm into it.''
</P>
<P>
   PAPSIDERA: There is the desire of actresses of a certain age,
meaning over the age of 30, not to be perceived as the mother
character. They want to be perceived as young and sexy. In the
remake of ``The Thomas Crown Affair,'' Rene Russo did a nude scene,
and it was good for her in that regard.

 Moderated by MIM UDOVITCH  
 c.2000 The New York Times Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to nudity, actresses are just like you and me _
self-conscious, vain, insecure, eager to please and sometimes
miserable. Except that when they take their clothes off, they know
that they have little if any control over how the images of their
naked bodies _ which will then be projected onto 30-foot screens in
front of millions of complete strangers _ will ultimately be
presented.
</P>
<P>
   Rosie Perez, whose first film role, in ``Do the Right Thing,''
had such a memorable nude scene that a decade later she's still
living it down (or up), convened a round table of some of her
friends and colleagues, inviting a reporter to participate, to talk
about the pressures, rewards and plain facts about getting naked in
public.
</P>
<P>
   ROSIE PEREZ (``White Men Can't Jump,'' ``Fearless''): I
initially wanted to do this round table because of my stepdaughter,
because she told me that there was a Web site where I was nude. And
it just brought up a lot of questions, because now that I'm older
and married and I have a 14-year-old stepdaughter, and she sees me
naked on a Web site, I'm like: How am I going to respond to her? Am
I going to say, Oh that's a horrible thing? I really had to go,
Wait a minute, do I really feel good about what I did? Do I feel
embarrassed in front of her because I did those things? And then I
started reaching even further, and I remember there was a point in
my career where I actually pulled back, because everybody wanted me
to do these movies where I'm taking off my clothes and
sassafrassing around, and then I found myself covering up, and I
was like, Well, that's not me, either. ... I see explicit covers on
magazines, and they're getting even more explicit, and it's like,
Are women being empowered, or is this just what sells magazines?
Are they feeling pressured, or have they really come into
themselves and are saying, I am woman, hear me roar?
</P>
<P>
   MIM UDOVITCH: Maybe we should start by going around the room and
talking about your first, or your most memorable, experiences with
doing nude scenes.
</P>
<P>
   PEREZ: My first experience, of course, was ``Do the Right
Thing.'' And I had a big problem with it, mainly because I was
afraid of what my family would think _ that's what was really
bothering me. It wasn't really about taking off my clothes. But I
also didn't feel good about it because the atmosphere wasn't
correct. And when Spike Lee puts ice cubes on my nipples, the
reason you don't see my head is because I'm crying. I was like, I
don't want to do this. I felt like Irene Cara in ``Fame.'' It was
like, Wait a minute, I feel so wimpy, this is not who I am. So that
was my first experience, and it was horrible. But then I went and
took my clothes off again for ``White Men Can't Jump.'' But that
was because it was totally my decision, I felt totally comfortable,
the director was so cool and Woody Harrelson was like, Well,
whatever you want is cool with me. So there I felt empowered by it.
</P>
<P>
   SARAH JESSICA PARKER (``Sex and the City,'' ``State and Main''):
Well, I've never done nudity. And I don't do nudity, and for no
particular moral reason. It's not a judgment, and I'm very admiring
of those people who feel comfortable enough to do it. The irony is
that I come from a very politically progressive family. But I've
just never felt comfortable, and I've always felt that I could
convince whoever had an idea that nudity might be good in a scene
that it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   UDOVITCH: So your contracts specify no nude scenes?
</P>
<P>
   PARKER: Yes. And now that I'm married, not that there's any kind
of dictatorship in the house, but he doesn't even really like to
see a photograph that is meant to be titillating or whatever, it
makes him feel uncomfortable. And I think I'm much more conscious
of that, too, now, like what I do at work, too, even a scene with a
bra and skirt.
</P>
<P>
   SANDRA BERNHARD (``The King of Comedy,'' ``I'm Still Here ...
Damn It''): For me, anytime I've used nudity in my work, I've
always felt strangely detached from it, and it's always been on a
lot of different levels that it's worked for me, and had sort of a
multipurpose emotional and cultural reference. So I've never felt
in any way, shape or form exploited or used, because it's always
been pretty much my decision. Even in ``King of Comedy,'' where I
stripped down for Jerry Lewis, it's such a perfect metaphor for any
woman's darkest fantasy. It's always been, I don't know, kind of a
kick for me _ having grown up being really skinny and, like, not
particularly confident, for me it's always felt really liberating.
</P>
<P>
   PEREZ: That's how I felt for ``White Men Can't Jump.''
</P>
<P>
   BERNHARD: But you're a little bit more bodacious than I am, so
I'm sure your whole life you've kind of been looked at in a much
more sexual way, and ogled. Also, when you do comedy, you're
usually alone onstage, so you're calling the shots. ... And in
terms of my own daughter, we kind of always wander around naked
together, so it's pretty open and relaxed. I think it's something I
missed growing up.
</P>
<P>
   SARITA CHOUDHURY (``Mississippi Masala,'' ``Kama Sutra''): My
first time nude was with a woman director, so I thought it would be
easy, but it wasn't. I got my period just before.
</P>
<P>
   DEBI MAZAR (``Goodfellas,'' ``The Insider''): Me, too!
</P>
<P>
   CHOUDHURY: Really? And so I didn't want to come down from the
room _ it was horrific. Usually, though, I feel really comfortable
during the scene, and then I hate it when the movie is going to
come out. My family is conservative, and that is hard. I don't know
why it's so liberating when I'm doing it and then ...
</P>
<P>
   PEREZ: It's funny. With family I don't know what to say anymore.
My father calls, and he says: ``Hello, baby! Do I see this one?''
``No.'' ``OK, bye!''
</P>
<P>
   AMBER VALLETTA (``What Lies Beneath,'' ``Drop Back Ten''): Well,
none of the films I've done were nude. But one of the first
modeling jobs I got that was big, that was a break, I got for
French Elle _ and in France nudity is not a big deal. I went on the
job because one of the two models got sick, and the other one was
Claudia Schiffer. Obviously I was kind of the nobody, so she got
all the work _ it was a week in the Seychelles, and they were like,
Well, we'll shoot a couple covers on you when we get a chance. I
was 17, maybe 18, and they asked me to take off my top for one of
these pictures. And the picture is of me like this (crosses arms
over breasts and freezes) and I look so uncomfortable. I had never
taken off my clothes for a photographer before, and he was
particularly mean, he was very macho, and it didn't make it any
easier. ... And since then I have done a few nude pictures and I'm
very, very careful about it _ like I know the number of nude
pictures that are out. But then there are runway photos that are on
the Internet. This one kid came up to me and said, ``Can you sign
this?'' And I looked, and it was a totally sheer top _ you could
see my breasts like it was broad daylight. And you just never
think, because it's for a fashion show, that those pictures might
get cut for _
</P>
<P>
   MAZAR: ``Celebrity Skin.''
</P>
<P>
   PEREZ: That was the Web site!
</P>
<P>
   VALLETTA: Actually, I've seen it twice now, so now I'm even
careful on runways, but sometimes you just say, ``I don't care, I
feel good.'' But the first one was definitely uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   UDOVITCH: The difference maybe is you're in a position now where
you can say no, and before you really _
</P>
<P>
   VALLETTA: I couldn't. I was trying to do a job, and I was with a
model who was already made, and she was going to do the picture if
I wasn't probably, and maybe not naked, but it would have been one
more for her and one less for me. And when you're young and naive
... it's not that you're not given a choice, but you maybe don't
know what your choices are.
</P>
<P>
   UDOVITCH: Everyone has said that power is an issue. Sandra has
said she's the most comfortable, and she's the one who has the most
power over what she does.
</P>
<P>
   MAZAR: For me, I basically had hippie parents, and I've always
been a very sexual person and OK with people seeing my body _ so my
first experience being naked, I gave full nudity. I read it, I
discussed it with the director, we discussed how we were going to
shoot it, it was going to be very Bu$uel-like, starting with the
tip of my heel, and we had it all mapped out, and I felt, Wow, this
is going to be really cool. It was my first big studio lead. It was
called ``Money for Nothing.'' It had John Cusack, Benicio Del Toro,
all these great actors. And then, at the end of the day, it was
completely gratuitous, like they just showed me sitting on him,
frontal. ... Now with love scenes, often if I read a script and I
don't trust a director, I have a clause, no nudity.
</P>
<P>
   PEREZ: That's something that's really bizarre, when you get to
that point in the Hollywood system where you have to negotiate
certain body parts.
</P>
<P>
   CHOUDHURY: Oh, completely! It's absurd!
</P>
<P>
   PEREZ: It's like, No below nipple, no crotch shot, only side, no
frontal, or in the frontal, only stomach _
</P>
<P>
   MAZAR: And no crack. Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   PEREZ: Right, no crack. They literally have these terms, and you
sit there thinking, What the hell is going on? It drives me crazy
to the point where I want to say, ``No, you can't show nothing,''
not because I don't believe in it, but because it's so absurd.
</P>
<P>
   PARKER: It's worth noting that we feel we need protection with
this, whereas everything else that we're told as women of a certain
generation is, We are as good, we're equal, we can have the whole
thing, and we still feel we need somebody, a manager or an agent or
a big, burly somebody, to say no.
</P>
<P>
   UDOVITCH: But then some women who have chosen to take their
clothes off, and examples that spring to mind are Demi Moore,
Madonna, Elizabeth Berkley, obviously a big range of performers
doing very different kinds of work, but they were all clobbered, in
a way that it's hard to believe anybody deserves for anything they
do in entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   MAZAR: Did it hurt them? No.
</P>
<P>
   PARKER: I think it hurt Elizabeth Berkley.
</P>
<P>
   CHOUDHURY: I think it hurt Demi Moore. I think it hurt her big
time.
</P>
<P>
   UDOVITCH: I think it hurt Madonna in the short term also.
</P>
<P>
   PARKER: Perhaps it's not fair to prognosticate about Elizabeth
Berkley, but it's an easy example in a way. I looked at
``Showgirls,'' and although I don't know what she was thinking,
what it felt like in the audience was, she wanted to be in a big
movie, and it wasn't good, the script wasn't good. But look how
different Gina Gershon was _ she seeemd very self-aware and ironic.
</P>
<P>
   UDOVITCH: I think Elizabeth Berkley was different in that she
was very young, and she just did what the director told her, and as
it happened, it didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   PEREZ (to Bernhard): What's the matter? Do you not agree, lady?
</P>
<P>
   BERNHARD: Nothing's the matter. I have nothing to say about
``Showgirls.'' I just think it's a campy, funny film, and I think
anybody in that role would have probably been in the same position.
...
</P>
<P>
   MAZAR: I went in to audition on that movie. I knew it was
(expletive) when I read it, and I thought, Man, I'll go in, and
I'll work it, I'll use my sexuality because I can.
</P>
<P>
   BERNHARD: Did you go in for Gina's role?
</P>
<P>
   MAZAR: Yeah. And when I walk into an audition, I do use my
sexuality to get a part, to put it out there, to convince them.
</P>
<P>
   BERNHARD: If you're going in and using your sexuality to get a
part, how can you ever get offended if they want you to be nude?
</P>
<P>
   MAZAR: I don't. But I decide when I get exploited now.
</P>
<P>
   BERNHARD: That's fair.
</P>
<P>
   PEREZ: I think one of the best examples of nudity I've seen
women do in movies is ``Blue Velvet,'' when home-chick came out on
the lawn and she's naked. That was where I thought nudity was so
appropriate, because this man tormented her and drove her to the
point of insanity, so when she walked out on the lawn, you weren't
saying to yourself, Oh, my God, Isabella Rossellini's naked, you
were saying, Oh, my God, she's finally flipped out, you're so
concentrated on her character.
</P>
<P>
   UDOVITCH: Another thing about Isabella Rossellini in ``Blue
Velvet'' is that she looked great when she came out naked, even
completely tormented, but what she also looked like was like an
un-worked-out body, and at that time, in 1986, you never saw that.
In the '80s, after Madonna got worked out, all the standards
changed. Because if you see '60s beach movies, those girls are
pretty, but they have thighs, their stomachs aren't flat and you
never see that anymore.
</P>
<P>
   BERNHARD: Or if you see any of Russ Meyer's films.
</P>
<P>
   PARKER: It's funny because I always think how beautiful Isabella
Rossellini is, and another person I always think of who's that
beautiful is her mother. And her mother was like, a Woman. It's
like, Oh, maybe someday I'll be a woman. She's just like flesh, and
sexy!
</P>
<P>
   BERNHARD: You better start eating, honey. You got a long way to
go.
</P>
<P>
   UDOVITCH: Did anyone see Kate Winslet in ``Holy Smoke''? She has
a normal body, and she's beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   PARKER: I love her.
</P>
<P>
   PEREZ: But talking about Madonna, the sculptured body, nudity
and sexuality, I feel so much pressure to stay small. And as you
get older, it gets a little bit harder, and I love to eat. And when
you go to Los Angeles, when you go on interviews and auditions, the
first thing they look at is your chest and your hips _ they want to
see how good your body is.
</P>
<P>
   MAZAR: I got prosthetic breasts, I got three sets. I got the
chicken cutlets for the normal size _ these are all for mastectomy
patients _ and then I got the next size, and then I got the nursing
size, and I use them to create different shapes of body depending
on the character, because sometimes I'll just figure out a way to
not take my top off if I get the movie. But to get it, sometimes I
walk in with these huge prosthetic breasts and big sweaters,
because you know, you get a whole other body language.
</P>
<P>
   CHOUDHURY: I liked Rosie's ice cube scene in ``Do the Right
Thing.''
</P>
<P>
   BERNHARD: But she was saying just before you got here that it
made her cry when she was doing it.
</P>
<P>
   CHOUDHURY: But I liked your body, because I have breasts, so I
was like, Oh, yeah. I was just comforted because there weren't many
girls with that build.
</P>
<P>
   UDOVITCH: I'm curious _ does anyone disdain people who choose to
augment their bodies?
</P>
<P>
   PARKER: It doesn't bother me. Also, you don't like to rule
anything out. I mean, I'd like to think I wouldn't do that, but
who's to say? It's different for women, we have this window,
certainly more in the movie business than in the theater, and even
in television it's probably a little better than in the movies. I
feel like I have this window in the movie industry, and it closes a
little bit every day, and I'm now one of these people who talk
about all these young people _ Who are they? Where are they coming
from? _ and they're all on the magazines. ... So when I think about
plastic surgery, I think, Well ... maybe it keeps the window open a
little longer.

   LAKE-GEORGE (Lake George, N.Y.) _ Divers in Lake George looked
deep into the water and found pieces of whole worlds: more than 60
shipwrecks lay forgotten in the lake's southernmost tip alone, and
elsewhere under the 32-mile length of clear water, submerged
vessels remain to be counted. The discoveries were made by divers
taking a first-ever inventory of the lake bottom _ an effort to

in 71 years, can be directly traced to NAFTA. By BILL DAY.

   STRIPERS (Chatham, Mass.) _ When the striper hit my little sand
eel imitation about 15 yards out, right at the edge of the channel,
it felt like I'd gotten stuck on a log. Except there are no logs on
the vast and sandy bottoms that comprise the shallow Monomoy flats
just south of Chatham on Cape Cod. Then this particular log decided

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A chocolate bar a day will keep the doctor away?
Well, maybe not, but research conducted over the past several years
indicates that chocolate isn't the guilty pleasure we thought it
was.
</P>
<P>
   Much ballyhooed research on fruits and vegetables, red wine and
green tea suggests that the antioxidant compounds found in those
foods in abundance provide protection against cancer and heart
disease.
</P>
<P>
   To explain the theory very loosely and in non-scientific terms,
free radicals are rogue molecules with a spare electron. Since
electrons like to live in pairs, the free radicals are constantly
looking for a mate for their spare electron. In the process, free
radicals can rob an electron from another molecule, damaging the
molecule. Free radicals reacting with DNA can cause cancer, lipid
and protein damage leads to atherosclerosis (hardening of the
arteries), diabetic complications and the bane of us all, aging.
Antioxidants, on the other hand, generously lend free radicals an
electron and render them impotent.
</P>
<P>
   Chocolate, too, contains antioxidants. And, as it turns out, a
lot of them.
</P>
<P>
   Chocolate is made by fermenting, roasting, and pressing the
beans of the cocoa tree to make ``chocolate'' liquor. This liquor
is then pressed to extract more cocoa butter, leaving a paste that
is ground and sifted to make cocoa powder. The primary nutrients in
cocoa powder include carbohydrates, proteins, mineral salts,
theobromine, caffeine, polyphenols and water.
</P>
<P>
   And polyphenols are a kind of antioxidant.
</P>
<P>
   Polyphenols protect plants from diseases and ultraviolet light
and help prevent seed damage. They also give fruits, vegetables,
wine and chocolate their color.
</P>
<P>
   Studies at Scranton University in Scranton, Pa., indicate that
gram for gram, chocolate has more polyphenols than kidney beans,
Bordeaux wines and even the much-lauded blueberry.
</P>
<P>
   Chemist Joe A. Vinson, who directed the Scranton study, says
chocolate hasn't received the hoopla of blueberries and broccoli
because other studies concentrated on foods with a lot of other
nutrients such as fruits, vegetables and beverages. Vinson's tests,
however, measure all the polyphenols in 100 grams (3.2 ounces) of a
specific food.
</P>
<P>
   To make the various forms of chocolate, the cocoa powder is
remixed with cocoa butter, diluting the concentration of the
polyphenols. Therefore, by weight, cocoa powder contains the most
polyphenols of all chocolate products. Dark chocolates, since they
contain additional cocoa butter and sugar, contain a lower
concentration of polyphenols, milk chocolate (which is made by
adding in milk, contain even less). Since white chocolate doesn't
contain cocoa powder but is a combination of cocoa butter, sugar
and flavorings, it contains no polyphenols at all. (Remember,
polyphenols give foods their color and white chocolate isn't very
colorful).
</P>
<P>
   In terms of serving sizes, a standard 1.5-ounce chocolate bar
contains about the same amount of polyphenols as a 5-ounce glass of
red wine, according to studies conducted at the University of
California at Davis. The advantage to red wine is that it contains
fewer calories and no fat. But then again, you can't be convicted
for driving under the influence of a Hershey bar.
</P>
<P>
   And remember, it's the chocolate that had been counted, not
crisped rice, caramel, flour sugar or any of the other things that
are mixed with chocolate to produce candy, cookies, cakes or even
mole sauce.
</P>
<P>
   And what about all that fat?
</P>
<P>
   Stearic acid, one of two saturated fatty acids in chocolate does
not raise total plasma levels or LDL (that's the ``bad''
cholesterol) levels like other fatty acids according to studies at
Pennsylvania State University. Also, Penn State found that
consumption of chocolate raised the HDL (``good'' cholesterol) and
protected the LDL from oxidation, both of which are factors in
decreasing the risk of heart disease
</P>
<P>
   In addition, further studies at UC-Davis indicate people who
were given cocoa beverages to drink had less clumping of blood
platelets for two to six hours after drinking the beverage.
</P>
<P>
   As for the calorie count, ``There's no arguing that chocolate is
a calorie dense food,'' Vinson says. ``And no one's recommended you
eat chocolate all the time. But if you're going to have a snack,
wouldn't you want one with some health benefits as opposed to
something, like say, potato chips, that are just as high in fat and
calories but don't contain as many polyphenols?''

&HT;     SOUP: A COOL WAY TO ENDURE THE SUMMER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BONNIE WALKER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Cold soup. Words that sound like an oxymoron in
January turn into a far more tantalizing proposition when July
rolls around.
</P>
<P>
   Deceptively simple to make, a chilled soup can be delicious and,
yes indeed, comforting when those temperatures start to climb into
three digits. Making it does present a few challenges, though.
</P>
<P>
   First, there's the fat problem.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, you can put cream into some cold soups, but forget butter,
shortening or vegetable oil. Fat that is absorbed in a hot soup,
adding all that delicious flavor, turns into unappealing little
pools on top of a soup that is cold. (All we can say here is, thank
heaven for olive oil.)
</P>
<P>
   Second, there is that thing that happens to flavors when food is
chilled. It is quite capable, when you least expect it, of pulling
a disappearing act.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there is the pesky matter of thickening. Make a fruit
soup, for example, thicken it up with a little roux, chill it down
and voila! You have a dull, icky mess on your hands.
</P>
<P>
   It might be enough to make us give up on the whole, chilly task,
but then we remember classics like iced consomme, or gazpacho,
Spain's delicious cold tomato and garlic soup. It's thickened to
just the right consistency with breadcrumbs, cooled, and served
garnished with all manner of crunchy and savory things _ chopped
olives, croutons, cold shrimp or crab.
</P>
<P>
   Or, a fruit soup with chunks of summer's best berries or peaches
drowned in a thick matrix of pureed fruit, sugar, white wine and a
thick drizzle of cream decorating the top.
</P>
<P>
   These cool soups are classics, meaning someone else has
surmounted the inherent difficulties for us. But anyone can create
a successful cold soup, quite simply, by adhering to a few
tried-and-true methods.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Blank, chef/owner at Hudson's on the Bend in Austin, Texas,
doesn't even think about the fat or thickening aspects of cold
soups. His colorful soup duo, chilled Poteet Strawberry and
Fredericksburg Peach Soup, is thickened by simply pureeing the
fruit with cream in separate blender batches and flavoring them
simply with a little sugar, white wine and lemon juice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fun dish. We put the strawberry and peach soups into
different glass pitchers or carafes. Then _ you have to have some
hand/eye coordination for this _ pour them into one bowl. Then, we
leave about a half-cup of one of the soups in the blender and whirl
in some blueberries and use (the mix) to paint the top of the
soups. You can really release the Picasso in yourself that way,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   This soup, he says, is Hudson's ``Tool Time Special'' _ ``the
best excuse there is for having duct tape and a blow torch in the
kitchen,'' says Blank. These tools aren't for making the soups, but
for fabricating a fancy iced flower bowl to serve it in.
</P>
<P>
   A sweet cold soup, such as this, can serve as either an
appetizer or a dessert. As an appetizer, a fruit soup piques the
appetite without overwhelming the palate. As a dessert, it provides
a light, refreshing finish that showcases summer's best produce.
</P>
<P>
   A savory cold soup is similarly flexible. It can serve as
appetizer, second course or main course. It just depends on how
it's presented.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Cohen, executive chef at La Mansion del Rio, tops his
gazpacho with a hearty mound of chilled fresh crabmeat. David Levy,
chef at the Westin Hotel's Caliza Grille, has a new summer item on
his menu _ a chilled calabaza (squash) soup with rock shrimp relish
and cinnamon cilantro oil.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Pedregon, cookbook author, chef and owner of the Peach
Tree Tea Room in Fredericksburg, Texas, has a recipe called Fiesta
Gazpacho that adds a Nuevo Latino touch to the classic recipe by
including black beans.
</P>
<P>
   Creamy cold soups are possibly the most popular at Pedregon's
restaurant, however. Her Chilled Avocado Soup, for instance,
doesn't lose flavor with chilling because the recipe calls for a
dash of Tabasco, some green onion and jalapeno. It gets its
thickness from buttermilk and sour cream and it is far and away the
most demanded cold soup on her summer menu, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kitchen gets so tired of making it they call it ``the
green menace,'' says Pedregon, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few points to remember about making a chilled, or
room temperature soup:
</P>
<P>
   _ Ingredients for cold soups are practically limitless. Use
fresh tomatoes and other seasonal produce, such as bell peppers,
onion, garlic. Roasted vegetables, such as squash, onions, pureed
cooked carrots, beets, zucchini, eggplant and so forth are good
seasoned with garlic and a little olive oil, pureed with fresh
herbs, fat-free chicken or vegetable stocks and so forth. Fruits,
such as avocado, mango, strawberries and peaches make good chilled
soups. Thin with a little wine, add a squeeze of lemon or lime for
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   _ Go light on sugar in fruit soups _ you want to taste
raspberry, strawberry or cherry, not sugar. Taste it as you make it
and leave it a little tart rather than too sweet.
</P>
<P>
   _ Thicken fruit soups with reduced purees of fruit, thick cream
or sour cream. Don't use flour, as it will give the soup a duller,
opaque finish rather than a bright, shiny one. If you are
thickening a fruit soup by cooking it before chilling, thicken with
cornstarch or tapioca mixed with a little cold liquid, then add to
soup and cook to desired thickness.
</P>
<P>
   _ After you've chilled your soup, taste it once again before
serving. If the chilling has dulled the flavor, add another pinch
of fresh herbs, spices, a splash of wine, lemon juice or other
flavoring.
</P>
<P>
   _ Garnish with fresh chives, thin slices of scallion, tiny
pieces of diced red, orange and yellow pepper, a dab or drizzle of
sour or fresh cream, croutons, slices of cucumber, carrot, celery
stick and so forth. Bright soups, such as berry soups, will show
off their colors best in a clear bowl or even a stemmed glass.

&HT;     GOP TAPS THREE LAWMAKERS TO LEAD CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By GARY MARTIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican leaders have tapped three lawmakers _ a
black a Hispanic and a woman _ for high-profile roles at the GOP's
presidential nominating convention that begins July 31 in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Henry Bonilla of Texas, Jennifer Dunn of Washington and
J.C. Watts of Oklahoma were selected by the Bush campaign and
advisers with the Republican National Committee to serve as deputy
permanent co-chairmen during the weeklong event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taking a while to sink in,'' said Bonilla, reached by
telephone in Laredo. ``It's a tremendous honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Naming a Hispanic, a woman and a black to the posts underscores
Texas Gov. George W. Bush's effort to reach out to ethnic
minorities and bridge the gender gap in this presidential campaign
against Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush is a different kind of Republican,'' said Scott
McClellan, a Bush spokesman in Austin. ``This is going to be a
different kind of convention, that reflects his positive and
inclusive agenda for America.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Allbaugh, the Bush campaign manager in Austin, notified
Bonilla of the selection earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   The three co-chairmen will emcee the 37th Republican National
Convention. Bonilla, Dunn and Watts will introduce a cast of
Republican speakers and oversee the formal nomination of Bush as
the GOP presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   It is the same role held by Bush and New Jersey Gov. Christie
Whitman in 1996 when Republicans nominated Bob Dole as their
presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla's stature within the party has continued to rise this
year, first as an adviser to Bush's campaign. He was later named
co-chairman of the RNC's Victory 2000 effort to reach out to
minority voters, a post that former GOP spokesman Mike Collins
called ``a major step'' in Bonilla's career.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn also was appointed to Victory 2000 in April.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla has been touted as a candidate for an administration
post if Bush is successful this November in his race against Gore.
The San Antonio congressman serves as a member of the powerful
House Appropriations Committee, a position that has helped him in
raising funds for the RNC and the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Watts, a former college quarterback, is a popular member of the
Oklahoma congressional delegation who was elected in 1998 to the
House leadership role of Republican Conference chairman. He is one
of several black Republicans advising the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn led an unsuccessful challenge to House Majority Leader Dick
Armey of Texas in 1998. This year she served with Sen. Kay Bailey
Hutchison, R-Texas, as a co-chair of the Republican Women Leaders
Forum attended by more than 1,000 GOP leaders nationwide.

 &HT;    RUSSIAN-CHECHEN WAR THREATENS REGIONAL SPILLOVER
 &HT;    By MARGARET COKER
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHATILI, Republic of Georgia _ At first glance, this fairy
tale-like medieval village perched halfway up a mountain slope
above the banks of a rushing mountain stream hardly seems like a
flashpoint for war.
</P>
<P>
   But almost every night, villagers say, explosions echo through
the craggy, snowcapped passes that mark Georgia's border with
Chechnya, as nearby Russian forces try to destroy the Chechen
separatist army that has enmeshed them in a nasty, brutish war of
hit-and-run attacks and suicide bombings.
</P>
<P>
   These battles have spilled into Georgia on at least three
occasions, with Russian helicopters bombing homes in Shatili and
wounding six people, and Russian forces occupying a Georgian
hamlet, according to the villagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am really afraid the war will come across the border.
Twenty-four hours a day we wait for Russian planes to bomb us,''
said Mikhail Tshintsharauri, a 64-year-old geography teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces have inflicted thousands of civilian deaths in
their 10-month-old war against Chechen separatists, ignoring
international condemnation of what the Kremlin calls a ``domestic
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   However, fresh evidence shows that rebels pass back and forth
across the porous border just as Russian forces have undertaken
secretive incursions into Georgian territory itself. These actions
belie Moscow's insistence that its military campaign in Chechnya is
an internal matter. They also threaten to expand Russia's backyard
war into a regional conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Although badly outnumbered and outgunned, Chechen rebels have
evaded Russia's full-frontal assaults over the winter by holing up
in secret headquarters in the Caucasus mountains, whose snow-capped
9,000-foot peaks are virtually impenetrable except to the Chechens
and Georgians who have lived in the remote region for generations.
</P>
<P>
   The slower pace of fighting through the spring led Russian
generals to boast that organized Chechen resistance had been wiped
out and the war was over. Yet, rebels continue to inflict mounting
casualties against them, often spectacularly. The fighters' new
tactic _ suicide bombers _ killed and wounded more than 150 Russian
servicemen last week alone.
</P>
<P>
   Such repeated debacles have frustrated and embarrassed Russia's
top brass and led to a steady stream of Kremlin vitriol against the
usual scapegoat for the persistence of the Chechen rebellion:
international Islamic terrorist organizations. But recently, the
Kremlin has found a new whipping-boy in Georgia, Russia's southern
neighbor located between the Caspian and Black Seas where some
7,000 Chechen refugees live.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Yastrzhembsky, Russian President Vladimir Putin's
spokesman for Chechnya, told reporters on June 23 the Kremlin had
intelligence that more than 800 Chechen fighters were in Georgia,
and that rebel commanders were using refugee camps located in
Georgia's Pankis Gorge, some 31 miles from the border, as a supply
base for weapons and supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know of a wide network of Chechen terrorists and
separatists (in Georgia),'' Yastrzhembsky said. The situation there
is ``getting out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgian officials say the 50-mile border separating the two
countries is effectively sealed, with more than 2,000 Russians
guarding passes on their side, and about one-third of that number
deployed on the Georgian side.
</P>
<P>
   While conceding that a few people may slip through the
cordoned-off frontier, Georgian border guards insist that large
groups of fighters have not used their land either as a safe haven
or for transshipping supplies or weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could anyone except an experienced mountain climber scale
that?'' said Col. Irakli Kopadze, standing in the narrow dirt path
leading to Shatili and waving an arm at the surrounding
mountainsides dotted with scrubby grass and treacherous footpaths
more fit for goats than humans. ``They may be passable for one or
two people, but not people loaded with heavy weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit to the Pankis, a lush, agricultural region in
eastern Georgia, the well-equipped, highly-organized network of
fighters alleged by the Kremlin was not readily visible.
</P>
<P>
   But hints of rebel sympathies were abundant in the regional town
of Duisi as well as in Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, where the
self-described Chechen ambassador to Georgia _ a man branded by
Russia as a war criminal and living with a Russian arrest warrant
over his head _ keeps a highly public profile despite the Georgian
government's denials of support for the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   In Duici, a group of 13 Chechen men, the majority of whom were
large, fit and in their mid-20s, were mingling and smoking near the
central outdoor market. All said they had fled homes in Chechnya
and lost family members to Russian attacks. None admitted to being
rebels themselves, but a few said they knew of fighters in the
village.
</P>
<P>
   A grizzled, unshaven 45-year-old man who identified himself as
Abu pointed out a house where he said four fighters wounded by
Russian land mines in Chechnya were recuperating under the care of
their relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif Sharip Djibrailov, a 52-year-old father of two from
Grozny, the Chechen capital, said men routinely slip across the
border from Georgia to return to Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young guys leave and go back to Chechnya,'' Djibrailov said
matter-of-factly. ``No one sees where they go. But they aren't
going back to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts in Tbilisi say the presence of a few fighters doesn't
prove Georgia's participation in the war. Still, they said, stories
like this fuel Russia's propaganda fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians aren't winning and they need someone to blame. So
they create rumors in Moscow (about rebel infiltration here). At
the same time, the Georgian government is weak. It doesn't control
what is going on either at the border or in the (Pankis) valley,''
said political analyst Sergi Prangishvili.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's belief that Georgia is indeed harboring terrorists has
led to multiple incursions by Russian forces into Georgian
territory, according to Georgian border officials.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic of these attacks occurred late last year. On
Nov. 17, 1999, three Russian helicopters bombed the pass between
the Russian and Georgian border posts, hitting the village of
Shatili. On Dec. 22, Russian helicopters again crossed over into
Georgian territory, shooting two rockets at houses in Shatili and
wounding six villagers.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow officially apologized for this incident, saying it had
intelligence that a home was being used as a Chechen communications
center _ an allegation Shatili residents deny.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Russian border guards have taken over a village
above Shatili higher in the mountain pass, which Georgian villagers
say is located in Georgia but the Russians say is located on their
side of the frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Georgian officials have lodged no official protest about the
incursions, much to the dismay of the local population, most of
whom believe their government is too weak to stand up to Russia
while international support for Moscow is unwavering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very angry my government speaks nothing of it,'' said
Tshintsharauri, the schoolteacher. ``We villagers saw it as a
provocation. Russia wants to start a war.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the Kremlin denied that its forces crossed into
Georgia and insists it is not in its interest to antagonize its
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fighting a war with a clever enemy. We are taking
precautions against this enemy. However, we would never violate
another country's border in pursuit of this,'' Kremlin spokesman
Yastrembsky said. ``This would make us equal to the terrorists whom
we are fighting.''

   DIGITAL-MEMORIES: Will Digital Photos Last for Years? (UNDATED)
Across the nation, shutter clicks are giving way to the beep of
digital cameras. Shipments of digital cameras are expected to rise
over 60 percent this year over last, one research firm says. The
average price will drop 8 percent by year's end and is expected to
plunge another 16 percent by the end of 2001. Lured by ever better
and cheaper cameras, more consumers are going digital. No waiting
(or paying) for processing, pictures can be posted to a Web page,
printed out an unlimited number of times, or sent to friends and
relatives by e-mail almost as quickly as they can be taken. But
there may be a hidden cost: Even as they snap away, most consumers
have given scant thought to archiving their growing store of
digital photos. By Margie Wylie. About 1200 words.

   CENSUS-POLITICS: GOP Resists Using Sampling as Census Fight
Continues (WASHINGTON) The 2000 census is ahead of schedule, on
budget and mired in politics and controversy. Despite an impressive
string of successes since it began in earnest on April 1, the
national head count has come under relentless attack from
Republicans over a plan to adjust the numbers to try to account for
millions of Americans who were missed. At stake is fair
representation in the nation's state legislatures and the House of
Representatives, along with billions of dollars in federal aid that
will be doled out over the next 10 years based on census data. By

THE THRILL OF THE GRILL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use after Sat., June 8, 2000 by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: This story is being transmitted to both lifestyle and food
wires. Goes with sidebar on food safety.)

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
So you can't stand the heat and want out of the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Exercise some grill power.
</P>
<P>
   No longer just a knockabout accessory for the occasional picnic
or poolside barbecue, today's outdoor grills have sophisticated
features, heating elements and accessories that make the grill an
all-purpose mega appliance for year-round cooking _ let alone a
great excuse to spend more time in the yard this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Outdoor set-ups can be nearly as versatile, functional and
efficient as indoor kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   And rest assured, grills offer plenty of variety to one's diet _
given the right equipment and, of course, the right chef at the
helm.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make it as kitchenlike as possible, but only as
much as you need it to be,'' says Dan Cannon, an Agua Dulce
resident and Southern California Barbeque Association president,
who rarely tires of grilling. ``I barbecue one to two days each
week year-round. I don't even let the rain stop me.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's grills smoke, steam, roast and rotisserie everything
from burgers, steaks and lobsters to leg of lamb, whole chickens
and turkey. Add-ons and side burners make it possible to serve up a
veggie saute, stir fry, pasta or sauce on the side.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the variety of food, limits are non-existing,''
agrees Ken Ostrander, manager of Barbeques Galore in Tarzana, which
sells grill accessories, parts, flavored wood chips and grills for
every price range.
</P>
<P>
   Accessories that adapt the grill to various cooking styles take
many forms: Skillets, smokers and adjustable baskets keep fish,
skewers and other meats from falling apart on the grill; Another
gadget resembling a slotted hub cap even bakes potatoes on the
grill.
</P>
<P>
   Steam trays are great for cooking seafood such as shrimp and
mussels, or vegetables like asparagus spears.
</P>
<P>
   And side burners _ which can be purchased separately, or found
attached to grills within most price ranges _ are handy for boiling
corn or beans, frying up peppers, mushrooms and onions as meat
toppers, heating sauces or cooking chili.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter the dinner menu, setting up an efficient barbecue
and work station is very important in creating complete meals
outdoors, notes Frank Boyer of the California Barbecue Association.
</P>
<P>
   Safety and location should be primary considerations, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Outdoor grills should be placed away from flammable objects like
houses and lawn furniture, combustible materials such as backup
barbecue fuel canisters, and _ for the grill master's sake _
preferably in shady areas where tree branches have been pruned and
won't catch fire.
</P>
<P>
   Metal pans should be kept near the grill to dump hot coals, as
well as a fire extinguisher for grease fires.
</P>
<P>
   The next consideration should be an ample work space to prepare,
cut or marinate foods, especially when the main grilled entree is
accompanied by grilled side dishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A prep area can be anything from a patio table that everyone
eats at to a special prep table used just for grilling,'' said
Cannon. ``And if you don't have those things, you can cut your
vegetables or season your meats in the house and carry them
outside, ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Many grills come with prep areas.
</P>
<P>
   On the top end, you can spend more than $6,000 for a permanent
backyard setup like a DCS natural gas-powered model at Barbeques
Galore that comes with stainless steel casing for its appliances,
twin burners, preparation counter, storage cabinets and
electrically charged refrigeration. Drawers make it easier to keep
grilling tools and accessories within reach.
</P>
<P>
   Less expensive charcoal and propane-powered grills also come
with preparation areas, though much smaller and shelflike, plus
tool racks and side-burners. Grills with these basic features run
as low as $150 to $200.
</P>
<P>
   Both Cannon and Boyer suggest other must-haves: Fresh water for
washing and rinsing hands and utensils, long tongs, separate
thermometers to measure food and heat source temperatures, separate

   &QL; 
So you can't stand the heat and want out of the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Exercise some grill power.
</P>
<P>
   No longer just a knockabout accessory for the occasional picnic
or poolside barbecue, today's outdoor grills have sophisticated
features, heating elements and accessories that make the grill an
all-purpose mega appliance for year-round cooking _ let alone a
great excuse to spend more time in the yard this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Outdoor set-ups can be nearly as versatile, functional and
efficient as indoor kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   And rest assured, grills offer plenty of variety to one's diet _
given the right equipment and, of course, the right chef at the
helm.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make it as kitchenlike as possible, but only as
much as you need it to be,'' says Dan Cannon, an Agua Dulce
resident and Southern California Barbeque Association president,
who rarely tires of grilling. ``I barbecue one to two days each
week year-round. I don't even let the rain stop me.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's grills smoke, steam, roast and rotisserie everything
from burgers, steaks and lobsters to leg of lamb, whole chickens
and turkey. Add-ons and side burners make it possible to serve up a
veggie saute, stir fry, pasta or sauce on the side.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the variety of food, limits are non-existing,''
agrees Ken Ostrander, manager of Barbeques Galore in Tarzana, which
sells grill accessories, parts, flavored wood chips and grills for
every price range.
</P>
<P>
   Accessories that adapt the grill to various cooking styles take
many forms: Skillets, smokers and adjustable baskets keep fish,
skewers and other meats from falling apart on the grill; Another
gadget resembling a slotted hub cap even bakes potatoes on the
grill.
</P>
<P>
   Steam trays are great for cooking seafood such as shrimp and
mussels, or vegetables like asparagus spears.
</P>
<P>
   And side burners _ which can be purchased separately, or found
attached to grills within most price ranges _ are handy for boiling
corn or beans, frying up peppers, mushrooms and onions as meat
toppers, heating sauces or cooking chili.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter the dinner menu, setting up an efficient barbecue
and work station is very important in creating complete meals
outdoors, notes Frank Boyer of the California Barbecue Association.
</P>
<P>
   Safety and location should be primary considerations, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Outdoor grills should be placed away from flammable objects like
houses and lawn furniture, combustible materials such as backup
barbecue fuel canisters, and _ for the grill master's sake _
preferably in shady areas where tree branches have been pruned and
won't catch fire.
</P>
<P>
   Metal pans should be kept near the grill to dump hot coals, as
well as a fire extinguisher for grease fires.
</P>
<P>
   The next consideration should be an ample work space to prepare,
cut or marinate foods, especially when the main grilled entree is
accompanied by grilled side dishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A prep area can be anything from a patio table that everyone
eats at to a special prep table used just for grilling,'' said
Cannon. ``And if you don't have those things, you can cut your
vegetables or season your meats in the house and carry them
outside, ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Many grills come with prep areas.
</P>
<P>
   On the top end, you can spend more than $6,000 for a permanent
backyard setup like a DCS natural gas-powered model at Barbeques
Galore that comes with stainless steel casing for its appliances,
twin burners, preparation counter, storage cabinets and
electrically charged refrigeration. Drawers make it easier to keep
grilling tools and accessories within reach.
</P>
<P>
   Less expensive charcoal and propane-powered grills also come
with preparation areas, though much smaller and shelflike, plus
tool racks and side-burners. Grills with these basic features run
as low as $150 to $200.
</P>
<P>
   Both Cannon and Boyer suggest other must-haves: Fresh water for
washing and rinsing hands and utensils, long tongs, separate
thermometers to measure food and heat source temperatures, separate
cutting boards and knives for poultry and meat, thermal gloves to
prevent burns, a good grill brush, spray bottle or brush and bowl
to baste food, and separate food storage areas for both cold and
hot food.
</P>
<P>
   Cannon also suggests installing Plexiglass walls around grill

   Health officials estimate that more than 85,000 food-borne
illnesses occur during the summer months in Los Angeles County _
about half the cases for the entire year.
</P>
<P>
   To kill food-poisoning bacteria when grilling:
</P>
<P>
   --Cook meat, poultry and fish thoroughly until well done, and
serve hot.
</P>
<P>
   --Never consume raw meat.
</P>
<P>
   --Reheat cooked food until very hot _ about 165 degrees
Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   --Refrigerate, or store in an ice chest, uncooked chicken in
plastic food storage bags or containers until ready for cooking or
marinating.
</P>
<P>
   --Store food containing eggs, poultry, meat or dairy products
separately to avoid cross contamination.
</P>
<P>
   --Do not allow other foods or cooking surfaces to touch raw
poultry or its drippings.
</P>
<P>
   --Likewise, do not reuse utensils, plates or bowls that have
been in contact with raw chicken, fish or meats for other raw or
cooked foods.
</P>
<P>
   --To prevent bacteria from multiplying, keep hot food hot and
cold food cold until ready to eat: Store uncooked or cold foods in
safe zones below 40 degrees and store freshly cooked foods in
warmers at a minimum of 140 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms of food-borne illnesses like salmonella can show up
from 30 minutes to three days after eating the contaminated food.
Vomiting, nausea, cramps, diarrhea and sometimes fever are common
symptoms. For more information on food safety, visit the Los
Angeles County Web site at www.lapublichealth.org or call the

BURTON SEEMS TO BE ON THE RIGHT TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Jeff Burton will be the first to admit his
luck has been extraordinarily good at New Hampshire International
Speedway, where the NASCAR Winston Cup driver has won the last
three July races at the 1.058-mile oval in Loudon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's been a good one for us,'' said Burton, driver of
No. 99 Exide Batteries Ford Taurus, who won the Pepsi 400 at
Daytona International Speedway last Saturday night. ``It's pretty
strange that we've won the same race that many times. You see
people who go to a racetrack and they have it figured out and run
well there a lot, but to win that many times is unusual, especially
when it's the same race and there's two races there a year.''
</P>
<P>
   So, it is not an understatement when Burton says of NHIS, ``We
like the racetrack.''
</P>
<P>
   What's not to like? For the last three Julys, it has been
Burton's personal playground, where he has recorded a quarter of
his 12 career victories on the Winston Cup circuit. Although Jiffy
Lube has pulled out as the primary sponsor of Sunday's race, which
for now will be called the New England 300, it wouldn't be
far-fetched if it were renamed the ``Jeffy Lube 300,'' in honor of
Burton's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first two, we just had the better car; we were just
faster,'' Burton said. ``We drove away from the people we needed to
beat. We had a better-handling car than most people and we had
track position when it counted, and we got our deal done.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton pointed to a number of factors for his success at NHIS.
First, there is his crew chief, Frank Stoddard, of North Haverhill,
N.H., who has developed quite a dossier on the track. Then there is
the support of car owner Jack Roush, whose deep pockets have always
provided Burton with the best equipment. And, finally, there is
Lady Luck, who certainly smiled upon Burton in last year's race.
</P>
<P>
   Burton qualified poorly and started 38th. After Saturday's Happy
Hour practice session yielded few results, Stoddard made
significant adjustments to the springs, shocks, and track bar _ on
the morning of the race, no less _ that enabled Burton to motor to
the front.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a lot of major changes, but we felt we had enough
experience there that we could make some of the right calls,'' said
Stoddard, who masterminded the two-tire pit strategy that enabled
Burton to win at Daytona last week. ``I wasn't worried about us
getting to the front, but I was concerned after Happy Hour that we
didn't have a fast enough car to get to the front. But with all the
changes we made, it turned out right.''
</P>
<P>
   The adjustments put Burton in position to win his third
consecutive Jiffy Lube 300 when Tony Stewart fell out of the lead,
running out of gas with 11 laps remaining. Burton pitted for a
quick splash of fuel with two laps to go and made a return visit to
Victory Lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we've won there, we've generally had a better-handling
car than most people,'' Burton said. ``We had the second-best
handling car last year, but the 20 car made a mistake and we were
in a position to win. You win a lot of races like that and you lose
a lot of races like that. You lose races where you had the best car
and something didn't go right for you, and you win races when you
had the next-best car and something went right for you.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the best car doesn't always win. And on that day, the best
car didn't win; the best strategy won.''
</P>
<P>
   As he sat in his hauler in the garage at Daytona last Friday,
Burton expressed some concern about going to New Hampshire because
``we have struggled at places that we've never struggled before,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth in the point standings, Burton said he hoped a return to
Victory Lane at NHIS would be the spark, the momentum boost, his
team needed at the start of the second half of the grueling Winston
Cup season.
</P>
<P>
   That was, of course, before Burton recorded his first
restrictor-plate victory at Daytona, where he finished runner-up to
Dale Jarrett in the Daytona 500. However, he held off Jarrett in an
exciting shootout with three laps to go to win the Pepsi 400.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really big for our race team,'' said Burton, who earned
$152,450 but remained fifth in points (2,314) behind leader Bobby
Labonte (2,527). ``We needed a kick in the pants and we got it. I
did a great job of driving and Frank did a great job of making some
calls and setting the car up.''
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, Burton will try to make it four in a row. Lest
you think it has never been done in NASCAR, think again. Darrell
Waltrip once won seven consecutive races at Bristol, Tenn.,
including four Valleydale 500s from 1981-1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about New Hampshire is that the race is long and
there's enough places to pass,'' Burton said. ``If your car is
driving well, there's places to pass, but if your car is not
driving well, you can't pass _ anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do qualify poor, it's the type of racetrack that will
allow you to get some moves made, but you've got to have everything
good go your way when you start in the back. You've got to have
good pit stops, you've got to make the right move at the right
time. It's a tough racetrack, but it's a fun racetrack.''

</P>
<P>
   No longer just a knockabout accessory for the occasional picnic
or poolside barbecue, today's outdoor grills have sophisticated
features, heating elements and accessories that make the grill an
all-purpose mega appliance for year-round cooking _ let alone a
great excuse to spend more time in the yard this summer.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Steam trays are great for cooking seafood such as shrimp and
mussels, or vegetables like asparagus spears.
</P>
<P>
   And side burners _ which can be purchased separately, or found
attached to grills within most price ranges _ are handy for boiling
corn or beans, frying up peppers, mushrooms and onions as meat
toppers, heating sauces or cooking chili.

   Both Cannon and Boyer suggest other must-haves: Fresh water for

to baste food, and separate food storage areas for both cold and

PLYWOOD SIDING COULD BECOME SHEATHING FOR CEDAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My house has T-1-11 plywood siding, and I would rather use it
as sheathing to put new cedar siding on. Is that practicable? Also,
along the gable ends, where there is a trim board following the
slope of the roof, should I remove that board before putting up the
siding, then put the board back over the siding? Or is it better to
leave the board in place and trim the siding so that it abuts the
sloping board?
</P>
<P>
   MIKE LYON, Canton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It is practicable to put cedar clapboards or shingles over
the T-1-11, but there is one important thing to be aware of. If the
windows and their frames are flush with that T-1-11, the new siding
will have nothing to butt against when it hits the frames of
windows and doors. So, you must nail a piece of trim or other
molding on the sides and tops of all windows and doors to provide
something for the siding to butt into.
</P>
<P>
   As for the rake board (the trim board that follows the slope of
the roof at the gable), the lazy way to do it in new construction
is to put up the siding, then put on the trim board. This results
in little openings at each row of clapboard or shingle, and these
openings are often used by nesting wasps. It's not a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   The other way is to put up the rake board (yours is already in
position), then trim the siding to butt against the rake board as
you apply it. This is fussy work, and takes time, and that is why
professionals don't like to do it. But it is much better, gives a
neater appearance (if you trim the siding for a snug fit), and
leaves no openings for critters.
</P>
<P>
   Since your rake boards are already in position, take the time to
trim the siding to fit the slope.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My finished-basement walls are covered with plasterboard. I
don't know how long the plasterboard has been up, but it was there
when I bought the house in 1987. The basement is dry. I would like
to paint those walls. Is there anything extra I have to do because
the walls are in the basement?
</P>
<P>
   STEVE POWERS, Kingston, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If there are no signs of wetness from the past, there is is
nothing extra you have to do. The standard procedure is to apply
two thin coats of a latex wall paint; it will be good for years.
But you can do one extra thing that will not take any extra work or
paint, to make sure you get a good bond on the plasterboard. And
that is: Apply one thin coat of a latex enamel undercoater, then
one coat of the latex wall paint. If your finish coat is white,
then one coat is needed. If the finish coat is a different color,
apply two coats.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that thick coats fail, but thin coats work most of
the time.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I can't find anyone who will wash and polish my mahogany
ceiling beams. They were polished and quite shiny, but they have
gotten dull. Where can I find a person who will do this?
</P>
<P>
   SARAH AGABIAN, Watertown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If it entails cleaning the beams, why not a housecleaning
service? Some services may say they don't do beams just as others
say they don't do windows. I have no answer to that. I doubt if the
beams were polished; the shine probably came from the varnish.
Cleaning them may dull them even further, but the shine can be
restored by buffing with a dry cloth.
</P>
<P>
   And why not leave well enough alone? They might benefit from
dusting, but even dull beams look good on a ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My roof is 75 years old with two layers of shingles on it.
The top layer is in good shape, and I know both layers must come
off. Trouble is, one roofer said he would not do anything unless I
strip the board planking and put in 3/4-inch plywood. Is that
necessary?
</P>
<P>
   DAVE CRISTMONT, Salisbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Whoa! It probably is not necessary, and if it were, the
roofer should do it. A roof 75 years old is unlikely to have bad
planks, but stripping the shingles will reveal any bad planks,
which can then be replaced. And certainly not everything's needs to
be covered with 3/4-inch plywood. At best, with some planks
replaced, 3/8-inch plywood is all you need to smooth everything
out.
</P>
<P>
   Find another roofer.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a nice Shaker bench that is painted with latex paint.
Can I paint it over with oil? If I can, how?
</P>
<P>
   CONNIE ANDREWS, Yarmouthport, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes you can, but why? Is the latex finish peeling? Is it
wearing off? OK, there must be a reason, so this is what you can
do: Sand the bench lightly to reduce gloss and roughen the finish,
apply an oil primer or a latex enamel undercoater (either will work
well), and finish with two thin coats of the oil enamel.

   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The New York Times just discovered that
California is no longer predominantly white, or as the Times put
it, ``the California of postwar popular imagination, of the Beach
Boys and the John Birch Society, of Disneyland and monochromatic
Pleasantvilles.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah yes, remember the days when everyone in California was blond,
even Annette Funicello.
</P>
<P>
   The Times breathlessly reported this week that sometime in the
next year ``California will become the first big state in the
nation in which non-Hispanic whites are officially no longer a
majority.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that news? And what's a non-Hispanic white? I always thought
people from Spain were white, or as close to that color as any of
us get.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind San Francisco and Oakland. When was the last time a
gentleman or gentlewoman from the Times visited the Santa Monica
Pier, the Santa Cruz Boardwalk or even the beaches of La Jolla or
Del Mar? It's been years since the average surfer girl or beach
boy, not to mention hodad, has been blond.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, it's been years since any blonds really have been blond.
</P>
<P>
   California dreaming always has been a pipe dream, and finally
the powers that be at the New York Times managed to take their eyes
off Al Gore and the Clintons and notice the reality of the state
where politicians raise much of their money. Maybe all those
fund-raisers in Beverly Hills and Woodside are a bit on the
monochromatic side.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there's anything wrong with being white. It's not right
to pick on minorities, especially a minority whose members
elsewhere in the country may be a self-satisfied majority. The
Times didn't directly address some of the questions Rush Limbaugh
might raise for a national audience upon reading the story.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever someone makes a joke about white men not being able to
jump, can we jump up in anger (well, a little way) instead of
having to force a smile?
</P>
<P>
   Can we have our own special programs to raise test scores so
white kids can get into the University of California?
</P>
<P>
   Can we start pronouncing our names with English, Norwegian or
Polish accents (particularly when signing off news reports) to
celebrate our heritage?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, of course, is no. Sorry, Rush. By the way, does
Limbaugh still have a show, or did all the angry white men turn
into resigned or guilt-ridden white men?
</P>
<P>
   There are bigger questions, ones for all Californians, not just
its newest minority:
</P>
<P>
   _ Will Woody Allen stop picking on California now that this
isn't the land of shallow blonds?
</P>
<P>
   _ Will the Eastern media ever look at California as something
other than a freak show? Once this was the land of surfers, hippies
and religious cults. Now it's the land of youth gangs, illegal
immigrants, techie weirdos and fat liberation.
</P>
<P>
   The Eastern establishment needs California the way Freud needed
an id, as a place to blame for all weird, powerful or unexplainable
impulses. Pardon the Woody Allenish invocation of Freud.
</P>
<P>
   First, Eastern snobs said the country was tilted to the left and
everything that wasn't tied down rolled in. Then they said all
strange ideas start in California and move east. Now they're saying
that everyone who isn't tied down in Latin America and Asia is
moving to California, as if that's a strange idea.
</P>
<P>
   If you wanted to get out of Latin America or Asia, wouldn't you
want to come here? California dreaming is done in all colors.

FINDING A VOCABULARY FOR SEXUAL ORIENTATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Parents around the country owe a debt of gratitude to David
Gaita, the gay first-grade teacher in Newton, Mass. who made
headlines after he came out to his students in May. Thanks to him,
we all have a reason to talk to our children about sexual
orientation, a subject we tend to avoid even though our culture,
not to mention our children's playground talk, is full of it.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind, we're talking about sexual orientation, not sexual
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not appropriate to talk to 6- or 7-year-olds about the
intimate acts two consenting adults engage in. It's confusing, not
something they can process,'' says San Francisco family therapist
Kevin Gogin, director of that city's public school health education
program, the most comprehensive in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Conversations about the mechanics of sex are better suited to a
slightly older child; in San Francisco, it's part of the fifth- and
sixth-grade health curriculums. Even then, Gogin says, teachers
simply provide definitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't talk about personal sexual practices,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Sexual orientation, on the other hand, is a concept children are
exposed to from birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sexual orientation explains family diversity; it's just that
we tend not to think of it that way,'' says clinical psychologist
April Martin of New York City. She says when we say things like
``Daddy loves Mommy'' or ``Mommy loves Daddy,'' we are teaching
about heterosexuality; when children observe our affection,
loyalty, and trust, they are learning about the partnership that
goes on between parents.
</P>
<P>
   By 4 or 5, most children notice on their own that there are
differences between families. In today's world, it's hard for them
not to: The typical day care or preschool has its share of children
raised by stepmothers, stepfathers, grandmothers, grandfathers,
parents of different races, two mothers, or two fathers. Despite
the differences, however, preschoolers are able to see that all
families are still basically the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as they understand that the Great Dane and the cocker
spaniel are both dogs, they know that two women raising a child and
a man and woman raising 11 children are both families, regardless
of how many people there are or the sex of the parents,'' says
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   To preschoolers, the differences are neither good nor bad; they
just are. This changes in elementary school, however. Kids begin to
hear things.
</P>
<P>
   From news headlines and local events like gay pride parades,
television shows with gay and lesbian characters (``Will and
Grace,'' ``Friends,'' ``Ellen,'' ``Spin City''), movies (``Ace
Ventura''), and magazines that trumpet the lifestyles of
celebrities such as Melissa Etheridge and Ellen DeGeneres, children
hear words such as ``gay,'' ``lesbian,'' and ``homosexual.''
</P>
<P>
   Do they know what the words mean?
</P>
<P>
   They don't at 4 or 5 or even 6 or 7, says developmental
psychologist Karen Anderson, but they attach values to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids pick up words: `gay,' `dyke,' `fag,' `homo.' They hear
them used on the playground and in the culture as put-downs, so
they attach negative stereotypes to them and hurl them without
really knowing what they mean,'' says Anderson. She is director of
the Center for Psychology in Schools and Education at the American
Psychological Association in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   This can be particularly hurtful to boys who don't fit the mold
of what a boy is supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gender rules are very powerful and rigid for kids 5 to 10,''
says Anderson. ``If you're a 7-year-old boy who doesn't like sports
but likes to read and play the cello, that's atypical gender
behavior, and you're likely going to be rejected because of it and
called fag or gay.''
</P>
<P>
   By middle school and often sooner, the stereotypes become the
foundation for confusion, discrimination, and violence.
</P>
<P>
   It's with this developmental background in mind that San
Francisco developed a health curriculum that includes ``My Family''
for kindergarteners.
</P>
<P>
   ``After they draw a picture of their own families, there's a
discussion of what other kinds of families there might be that
aren't already represented,'' for instance, two dads or two moms,
says Gogin. Teachers define heterosexual as ``a person who is
attracted to and falls in love with a person of the opposite sex''
and homosexual as ``a person who is attracted to and falls in love
with a person of the same sex.'' They also say homosexuals are
known as gay men and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a conversation about sex,'' says Gogin. ``It's
about the way people are in our community. For 5- to 8-year-olds,
this is a source of comfort and safety: They see the diversity
around them, they may even live it.''
</P>
<P>
   For child psychologist Dan McPherson of San Francisco, getting
stereotypes out in the open when children are young can go a long
way to making the world easier and safer for them as they grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most kids develop odd notions unless we clear up their
language and their stereotypes,'' he says. Questions and comments
he typically gets from young children include: ``What do gay people
eat?'' or ``I don't think I can be gay because I want to be a
doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the San Francisco curriculum is the idea of
respect and tolerance for all differences. Gogin describes an
activity for fifth-graders that drives it home graphically:
</P>
<P>
   Each child creates a cutout of him/herself that the teacher
links to form a paper people chain. She asks the students to keep
track of the name-calling they hear in a day. As they share the
insults with the class, she breaks one link in the chain for every
slur, demonstrating how damaging insults can be. Then the class
talks about how to repair the hurts.
</P>
<P>
   This, obviously, is not just about homosexuality, but about
accepting all diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very powerful,'' says Gogin.
</P>
<P>
   Once the subject of homosexuality is raised in the classroom,
parents, of course, have an opening to talk about their own values,
says sexuality educator Debra Haffner, author of ``From Diapers to
Dating'' (Newmarket) and former executive director of the Sexuality
Information and Education Council of the United States. For
instance, ``In our family, here's what we think about this . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, this is what Newton parents did after David Gaita
sent home a letter detailing the conversation he had in his
classroom May 17. According to reports, as the class discussed
biographies and families, students asked about his family. He told
them that if he had a partner, it would be a man, and he defined a
partner as ``someone you love the way your mom and dad love each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaita's principal and Newton schools superintendent Jeff Young
were supportive of Gaita, as were most parents. Psychologist
Anderson says Gaita handled the situation ``beautifully. It's what
every parent should hope for in a teacher.''

   Sexual orientation refers to whether a person is heterosexual,
homosexual, or bisexual (a person attracted to both men and women).
Heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual people are alike except for
their sexual attraction. Homosexuals and bisexuals are often
mistreated, called hurtful names, or denied their rights because of
sexual orientation. Some people are afraid to admit they are
bisexual or homosexual because they fear they will be mistreated.
Homosexual love relations can be as fulfilling as heterosexual
relationships. &QL;

   AFTERTHOUGHT _ Instead of pointing out to your child only the
times he doesn't meet your expectations, catch him in the act of
doing something right and make it a big deal. For instance, brag to
someone about it when you know he'll overhear you. From ``Boost
Your Child's Self-Esteem: Simple, Effective Ways to Build

PALMTOP SUFFERS; MICROSOFT, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since Microsoft Corp. found itself ensnared in the federal
antitrust lawsuit, industry mavens like me have been on the lookout
for signs that the software titan was going soft under the strain.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a few: Microsoft's inability to quash the
growing popularity of the Linux operating system, and the
retirements and departures of many of the firm's key executives.
Now I think I've stumbled across yet another sign of corporate
decay _ a good Microsoft product that would probably have been
better, if the company had been able to pop the whip as it did back
in the day.
</P>
<P>
   I refer to one of the latest palmtop computers running
Microsoft's Pocket PC software. I've spent a month using the
Hewlett-Packard Jornada 540, and the glitches and imperfections
I've stumbled across prove that Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard
aren't singing from the same hymnbook.
</P>
<P>
   I figure the antitrust case is partly to blame. Among other
things, Microsoft was condemned because it wouldn't let desktop
computer makers change the look and feel of the Windows operating
system. In the view of the US Justice Department, Microsoft's
tactics deprived the public of countless innovations in computer
user interfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. But consider the alternatives. Apple Computer Inc.
makes both the hardware and software for the Macintosh computer;
Palm Inc. makes the hardware and software for the Palm Pilot.
Because of this total control, both companies produce products that
are elegant and easy to use. Microsoft doesn't make computer
hardware, so it tried to keep it simple for consumers by ordering
PC makers not to touch anything. Looks like they can't do that any
more.
</P>
<P>
   And so we end up with the user interface of the HP Jornada. It's
like trying to use two computers at once; both HP and Microsoft
have installed their own menus, each with a different layout. There
are two places where you can reset screen contrast, but only one
for adjusting screen brightness. There are two places for checking
available memory; one lets you adjust memory levels, while the
other does not.
</P>
<P>
   In the good old days, Microsoft would simply have told HP to sit
down, shut up, and do it their way. Unfair, perhaps. Nasty?
Definitely. But it would have made the Jornada a lot easier to use.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another irksome example. The Jornada has a built-in
digital voice recorder that I used to record a half-hour interview.
I dumped the file onto my desktop computer, only to discover that
it could only be played back on the Jornada. Nobody has written PC
software that'll play back this sound format. I could have reset
the device to use a PC-compatible format if I'd known. But once
upon a time, I wouldn't have had to know. Microsoft would have
insisted that HP make its sound files PC-compatible or else. Ah,
those were the good old days.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe a bruised, demoralized Microsoft is also easing up on its
own employees. That might explain the Jornada's most inexcusable
flaw.
</P>
<P>
   Like any good palmtop, the Jornada can store your personal
address book. During a road trip, I needed to look up a contact at
IBM Corp. I couldn't remember the name; I just knew he was at IBM.
And that meant the Jornada was useless, because the
Microsoft-designed contact program won't let you search by company
name.
</P>
<P>
   Every other palmtop I've ever seen has this feature, including
previous Pocket PCs. But out of carelessness or laziness, Microsoft
has left it out. It's an astonishing lapse, and I couldn't imagine
buying a Pocket PC until it's fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Which is a pity, because there's much to like about the $500
Jornada. It's smaller and lighter than previous Pocket PC models,
weighing and costing about the same as a Palm Pilot with a color
screen. And it boasts features that Palm Pilot users can only dream
about. There's the built-voice recording, for instance, and the
ability to play MP3 music files. Microsoft Reader, the company's
new electronic book software, is excellent; small enough for a
jacket pocket but clear enough to let me read the latest Michael
Crichton bestseller during a plane ride to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing wrong with the Jornada that couldn't be fixed by
a ruthless, aggressive corporate bully that would ride roughshod
over its partners and employees to get the product right. There
used to be a company like that in Seattle.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Long before the first drugs derived from the human genome
project ever reach pharmacists' shelves, gene-based diagnostic
tests will emerge to assess a patient's chances for a complete
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Medicine has begun a major shift, toward being able to remedy
the underlying causes of diseases and away from relying on the
diagnosis and treatment of symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, scientists are developing tests to predict
whether a patient will suffer a relapse and require more radical
treatment, or enjoy a speedy and complete recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Initially focused on cancer, these diagnostic and genomic tests
are aimed at recovering patients who want to know whether the
disease is no longer active or will pose problems down the road.
The results could lead to more aggressive medical treatment and
counseling, or provide the relief of knowing that a tumor is
benign.
</P>
<P>
   Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc. has developed such a test for
melanoma patients, based on a gene that produces melastatin. Tumors
removed from under the skin would be tested at a laboratory by
pathologists. Tumors containing melastatin are most likely to be
cancer-free, while those with little or no melastatin could cause
more serious skin cancer problems, said Dr. Michael Kaufman, vice
president of medicine at Millennium's Predictive Medicine group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are measuring the distribution of melastatin in a tumor,
and from that determining how the cancer has spread,'' said
Kaufman, noting there are 44,000 new cases of skin cancer annually
and that 1 in every 75 Americans will get skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Millennium's skin cancer test, which will be marketed by Becton
Dickinson &AMP; Co., a supplier of medical devices, diagnostic systems
and equipment, is one of six diagnostic genomic cancer tests being
developed based on Millennium Predictive Medicine's gene
discoveries. The company's president, Kenneth Conway, expects the
skin cancer test to be on the market this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to change the practice of medicine,'' he said, ``with
tests based on our knowledge of cancer genes that enable people who
have a problem to do something positive about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Details about the test, which was developed and tested at
Massachusetts General Hospital, are expected to be published by
fall, said Dr. Lyn M. Duncan, an assistant professor of pathology
at Harvard Medical School and a Mass. General pathologist who
worked closely with Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the tools we use for skin and many other cancers
are largely based on physical observations,'' Duncan said. ``I
think the public and cancer patients can expect a wealth of
information from the human genome project.''
</P>
<P>
   The Millennium/Becton Dickinson tests are considered the first
wave of a new generation of gene-based predictive tests. Within the
next 10 years, geneticists say researchers will create genetic
tests that will be able to predict babies' predisposition for
breast, colon, and prostate cancer, heart disease, and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   The use of patient information from such genetic tests raises
some ethical and legal questions. Despite federal laws including
the Americans with Disabilities Act that bans the use of genetic
tests to discriminate in the workplace, the extent of consumer
protection has yet to be tested in court.
</P>
<P>
   From the inception of the human genome projects, ethicists have
warned that genetic knowledge might be used against people as it
relates to insurance coverage and employment. In February,
President Clinton issued an order barring genetic discrimination in
the hiring of federal workers. He also endorsed legislation now
pending in Congress that would prohibit enrollment restrictions and
higher premiums for health and life insurance policies based on
predictive genetic information or genetic services.
</P>
<P>
   While several states have already added genetic privacy laws,
Massachusetts is now looking to develop one that would protect
against the dissemination of genetic test information.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a survey of the American Management Association found
30 percent of large and mid-sized firms seek some form of genetic
information about their employees, of which 7 percent used that
information in awarding promotions and hiring.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Millennium/Becton Dickinson genetic skin cancer test
stands out because of its predictive capabilities. The exam _
expected to be performed as an adjunct to the standard tumor
thickness measurement exam by pathologists _ is different from the
more than 200 genetic exams now on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the tests currently available can cost between $800 and
$2,500 each. They range from determining genetic diseases in
newborns to learning whether an individual has a mutated gene and
is a carrier of a disease, such as cystic fibrosis, Huntington's
disease, or sickle cell anemia.
</P>
<P>
   Other genetic tests can determine whether there is a family
history of disease even without any current symptoms or calculate
the probability that a healthy individual with or without a family
history will develop that disease.
</P>
<P>
   Exact Laboratories Inc. of Maynard is developing a colon cancer
test that measures the abnormal amount of DNA in a person's stool.
Currently, colon cancer is evaluated through sigmoidoscopies and
colonoscopies _ devices that physicans use to visually examine the
colon.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our test you either have colon cancer or you don't,''
said Stanley Lapidus, Exact's chief executive, noting the proposed
test is currently undergoing a pivotal clinical trial.
</P>
<P>
   Millennium's entry into the diagnostic market with Becton
Dickinson follows several companies developing breast cancer tests.
One of the first genetic cancer exams came from Myriad Genetics
Inc. of Salt Lake City, which found two specific genes, BRCA1 and
BRCA2, that are linked to breast cancer. However, its genetic
predisposition test is limited, since fewer than 8 percent of women
with breast cancer have mutations in these genes.
</P>
<P>
   And there are many nongenetic tests that identify whether a
person has a certain disease ranging, from pap smears that women
have annually to detect signs of cervical cancer, to a simple urine
test developed by Matritech Inc. of Newton, Mass. for diagnosing
bladder cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see ourselves as complementary to what Millennium has,''
said David L. Corbett, president and chief operating officer of
Matritech, which is developing a series of other cancer tests based
on its patented nuclear matrix proteins.

AT 175 MPH, 911 TURBO CAUSES EARTH TO SHIFT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACK ROCK DESERT, Nev. _ We are strapped tightly into the 2001
Porsche 911 Turbo as it reaches 150 miles per hour and sizzles
across the cracked desert floor.
</P>
<P>
   Between the two of us we have five wins at the 24 Hours of
Daytona, three wins at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, two wins at the 12
Hours of Sebring, and four good wrecks at the Hopkinton, N.H.,
State Fair Demolition Derby.
</P>
<P>
   All the endurance wins belong to the great Hurley Haywood. The
demolition derby wrecks were mine.
</P>
<P>
   I am driving as we head to 175-plus miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   The surface over which we race is the hard, dried silt of a
playa (Spanish for intermittent lake). In 1997, a jet car broke the
sound barrier on this surface. But it is not stable. Cracked in the
sun, it resembles an unassembled jigsaw puzzle. Even light cars
leave shattered tracks. In some places, the pieces shift beneath
your feet.
</P>
<P>
   The effect can be disconcerting. In a test run parallel to the
main track on which we go for a top speed, the car had wiggled its
rear steadily as the surface shifted beneath it. Like driving in an
inch of snow.
</P>
<P>
   Haywood's advice? Let the car go where it will go. Use the wheel
ever so delicately. Half-inch turns in either direction are plenty.
But that is not your instinct when, at 125 miles per hour, the car
hints at slipping sideways. There is a danger of overcorrecting.
That would be a bad thing, especially at higher speeds. Delicate
steering takes some time to get used to when your head screams
``countersteer.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, I have had two days and more than 300 miles in this
marvelous new car, which is the fastest, most stable street machine
Porsche has ever built.
</P>
<P>
   It is an all-wheel-drive, road-eating beast powered by an
all-new Porsche engine based on the power plant from the Le
Mans-winning GT1 race car. With two intercooled turbochargers and
24 valves, the 3.6-liter engine packs a walloping 415 horsepower
and 413 lb.-ft. of torque.
</P>
<P>
   Most impressive is the peak torque band, which runs from 2,700
to 4,600 rpms. Even in sixth gear with the manual transmission, the
car picks up and goes like a rocket.
</P>
<P>
   It does 0-62 in 4.2 seconds. Top speed can be around 190 miles
per hour. Air dams with channeled flows, spoiler lips at the front
of the wheel arches, and a hydraulic rear wing (it pops up at 75
m.p.h.) provide down force to keep the Porsche hugging the road.
</P>
<P>
   And hug it it does, as those 300 miles proved.
</P>
<P>
   There are places in Nevada where undulating roads stretch as far
as you can see. A tempting place to let it rip. And it's clear that
this Porsche could go from top speed limit well into triple digits
in seconds.
</P>
<P>
   There are places in Nevada where roads climb up to 9,000 feet _
roads that twist and turn and switch back again and again.
Sometimes there are guardrails, sometimes there are not. In some
places, you round a corner and are looking out over an endless
valley 4,000 feet below. It's as if you're looking out the
windscreen of an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   One of these snakes runs up to Virginia City, the old mining
town. It is here they hold the Virginia City Hill Climb. A tempting
place to see how the Porsche corners at speed.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear the 911 Turbo could rip the brief straights in triple
digits, take the corners and hairpins and switchbacks at four times
the posted limit, and feel as if it's riding on rails.
</P>
<P>
   The faster these cars go, the more stable they become, one
Porsche executive said at the car's introduction in Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Back out on the Black Rock Desert Playa, stability was just what
I was looking for.
</P>
<P>
   The acceleration run was to be made along a 3-mile course.
Orange cones marked its edges. In the distance, mirages that looked
like silver clouds danced along the horizon. The curvature of the
earth was evident.
</P>
<P>
   The speed test 911 was the European model _ 20 millimeters lower
than the US model. Its Pirelli N3 tires had been X-rayed to check
for defects.
</P>
<P>
   For safety equipment, it had an elaborate roll cage, racing
seats, and five-point safety harness. It also came equipped with
Haywood.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was to speed up through the first mile, hit the second
and critical measured mile at high speed, put the gas pedal to the
floor and keep it there as the United States Auto Club recorded
average speed for the mile and top speed. The third mile would be
used to slow down. It was this last, frankly, that worried me more
than running the middle mile at speed. How do you stop smoothly on
this surface? Let's find out.
</P>
<P>
   We took off gradually, then worked our way up through the gears,
the familiar wiggle setting in at about 100 miles per hour _ the
last time I looked down at the speedometer.
</P>
<P>
   I looked only straight ahead and well down the race course. At
high speed, looking out the side or too close to the front of the
car can induce dizziness.
</P>
<P>
   The cones seemed to rise out of the desert floor straight ahead,
popping up for split seconds and disappearing. I don't know what
speed we were doing when we hit the measured mile, but everything
seemed to smooth out. Later I was told the surface was a bit
smoother there.
</P>
<P>
   I never saw the monitors at the beginning or end of the measured
portion. I was too busy looking far out and straight ahead. Haywood
did, though, and once we were through talked me into a graceful
slowdown _ backing off slowly on the gas, not touching the brake
until we'd dropped to 100, and then only touching it softly.
</P>
<P>
   I'd averaged 169.411 through the mile. Top speed was 175.438.
The Porsche could go faster, but Haywood said later that was plenty
fast on that surface.
</P>
<P>
   For my run, I got a plaque. Haywood got to survive. He's got
plenty of plaques and trophies.

WHEN MEN'S BODIES AREN'T UP TO BUFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Women aren't the only sex that suffers from Bad Body Fever, the
pressure to conform to a body image that is, for most, unrealistic.
The authors of a recent book, ``The Adonis Complex,'' contend that
millions of insecure American men are linking their self-worth to
body image. Guess who's to blame? Women. Guess who can help? Women.
Because guess who'll read this book? That's right. Women.
</P>
<P>
   Men of all ages ``in unprecedented numbers'' are preoccupied
with the appearance of their bodies, according to the authors,
Harrison G. Pope, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical
School, Katharine A. Phillips, an associate professor of psychiatry
at Brown University, and Roberto Olivardia, a clinical fellow in
psychology at Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of boys and men exercise compulsively, gobble
``muscle-building'' food supplements and diet aids, take anabolic
steroids and other dangerous illegal drugs. Increasing numbers of
men develop eating disorders. A million or more suffer from ``body
dismorphic disorder,'' an excessive preoccupation with perceived
flaws in their appearance that leads many to undergo cosmetic
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all their efforts, they feel like failures because they
don't resemble pumped-up Hollywood stars like Arnold Schwarzenegger
and Mel Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   The Adonis Complex has reached plague proportions only in recent
years. In one 1972 survey cited by the authors, only 15 percent of
men said they were dissatisfied with their bodies, compared with 25
percent of women. A follow-up survey in 1997 indicated that 43
percent of men were dissatisfied, compared with 56 percent of
women. While the percentage of both sexes saying they disliked
their bodies rose dramatically from 1972 to 1997, women's body
problems have gotten most of the attention. Men have been
overlooked, largely because they don't want to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   The authors contend that at the core of the problem is
``threatened masculinity.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, they note, women can do just about anything men can
do. Fly combat aircraft. Work as police chiefs. Operate heavy
machinery. Become CEOs of big corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``What then do men have left to distinguish themselves, to mark
their masculinity?'' the authors ask.
</P>
<P>
   OK, they've got that. But what else?
</P>
<P>
   Muscularity, the authors say. It's one of the few areas in which
women can never match men: ``No matter what crowning achievements
women accomplish, they will never, ever be able to bench-press 350
pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   But what accounts for the startling increase in the last 25
years in the percentage of women who are unhappy with their
appearance? You might think they'd be too busy flying combat
aircraft and becoming CEOs to anguish over the size and shape of
their bodies. But of course they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Threatened masculinity'' may explain why some boys and men are
obsessed with their appearance, but it seems clear that the most
potent influence is popular culture. Hollywood, advertising, the
music and fashion industries, the popular media have conspired to
bamboozle women and men alike into believing that a perfect form
equals a perfect life.
</P>
<P>
   Women, the authors write, are at an advantage because they have
already been learning how to ``confront'' the media's impossible
ideals of beauty. They urge women to help the men and boys in their
lives by talking with them about the hollow promises of the Adonis
Complex. But will talking help? Or will it threaten their
masculinity?

WITH NEW CABRIOLET, PORSCHE SAYS: LEAVE THE CORNERING TO US 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RENO _ There's great variety in driving a different car every
week. But there can also be a certain sameness _ same commute into
the city; one dirt road's another dirt road; tree-lined country
lanes blur even in their beauty.
</P>
<P>
   That's why it's good to get away and drive once in a while. It's
why taking the 2000 Porsche 911 Cabriolet on a run from here to San
Francisco and back _ and later playing on the mountains and deserts
that surround Reno _ was such a recent treat.
</P>
<P>
   This is the 911 descended from a long line that began in 1965.
Its latest incarnation was given to us for the 1999 model year and
has been tweaked just a bit for 2000. In the Porsche world right
now, the basic 911 does not have the buzz that surrounds other
models _ Boxster and Boxster S, the Carrera 4, and the hot new
all-wheel-drive 911 Turbo. But the 911 is, after all, the spine of
Porsche.
</P>
<P>
   So we drove it up and over the mountains, Reno to the City by
the Bay, up steep Interstate 80, down winding Interstate 80,
through the valley at Sacramento, and to the sea. Back in the
Reno-Tahoe area, we climbed on tortuous roads to 9,000 feet in a
curving ascent that would give angst to acrophobes. And we rolled
across remote stretches of desert (carefully obeying traffic laws
on Indian reservations where, we were told, even three miles an
hour over the speed limit meant a $500 fine, payable on the spot).
</P>
<P>
   It was easy spending hours at a time in this car, just enjoying
its power, its handling, its comfort.
</P>
<P>
   It surged along the highway, charged up the steepest stretches
the Nevada-California border could offer.
</P>
<P>
   On rolling desert highway, with visibility as far as the eye
could see, it was obvious you could run in the 911 Cabriolet for as
long as you wanted at speeds well into the triple digits.
</P>
<P>
   On those hairpinned and switchback climbs and descents on lesser
roads _ and we're talking no guardrails sometimes _ it cornered on
rails of its own. It's rear-wheel drive, and even without Porsche
Stability Management, it felt as though you'd have to try real hard
to shake the rear end loose or to induce terminal understeer.
</P>
<P>
   In short, superb, solid handling.
</P>
<P>
   The multi-layered suspension includes independent struts,
aluminum lower control arms, coil springs, stabilizer bar, and
gas-charged twin tube shocks up front and, in the rear, an
independent five-link setup with coil springs, single tube shocks,
and stabilizer bar.
</P>
<P>
   You get no body roll, no sense of the torsional twist you might
expect in a drop-top. You might be able to induce a touch of the
latter on a racetrack, but not many of us will be driving a
Cabriolet there.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of Porsche, the braking was superb: Set weight to the
front wheels to enter a fast corner and it took only the slightest
touch. Try to bring it down from high speed in a desert experiment
and it will track true to a belt-tightening stop.
</P>
<P>
   The ride was exceptionally quiet for a convertible, the seats
low and firm (Porsche-like again), though I'd question whether you
could fairly call this a 2x2 since any two adults in the rear would
be chewing on their knees. Of course, we could just pretend it's
still the '60s and that's just part of the adventure.
</P>
<P>
   If I had one complaint to make from the driver's seat it would
be that a big swath of canvas at the rear corners of the roof
blocks the view.
</P>
<P>
   For safety, it's got airbags all around and a roll bar that
automatically deploys once the car tilts to that certain scary
angle.
</P>
<P>
   In 911 fashion, the engine is a horizontally opposed
six-cylinder (hey, Subaru likes the idea so much you'll see one in
the new Outback). This helps keep the center of gravity low. It's a
3.4 liter that, because of an improved exhaust system, gives four
more horsepower (300) than the '99 model. You can have a six-speed
manual or the five-speed Tiptronic.
</P>
<P>
   The test model had the Tiptronic, with wheel-mounted controls.
Working the gears was a lot like playing a video game.
</P>
<P>
   Also helping boost performance for 2000 is an ``E-throttle.''
You may think you're stepping on the gas and causing direct action,
but as a Porsche guy explained to me, what you do with the pedal is
merely a suggestion to the car's control center, which then uses
cams, valves, and the air and fuel supply to do that job best for
you.
</P>
<P>
   I put about 800 miles on the Cabriolet, much of it at high
altitude and on steep grades, and got 19 miles per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   This is a superb car, but here would be my dilemma: I haven't
driven the Boxster S, yet I've heard great things about its
performance. Before I'd drop $80,000 on the 911, I'd want to know
one thing: Is it $30,000 better than the Boxster S?
</P>
<P>
   I'll get into the latter real soon.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touch:
</P>
<P>
   --The one-touch operation of the convertible top. Fifteen
seconds and it's tucked away under a big smooth crescent.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance:
</P>
<P>
   --They sell you a convertible for $80,000 _ and then want $250
for a rear wind deflector? I don't think so.

NOW, REDO SOME BAD OLD FLOORS WITHOUT SANDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Millions of words have been written about floors, most of them
about wood floors: installing, sanding, staining and finishing. And
resanding, restaining and refinishing.
</P>
<P>
   Hardwood or pine? The treatment for hardwood _ oak, cherry,
birch and maple _ is the same as for pine.
</P>
<P>
   And if someone says you cannot sand a softwood floor because it
is too soft, tell him to back off; any wood floor can be sanded
unless it it has been sanded so many times that the boards are
paper thin, and nails are showing through.
</P>
<P>
   That's the beauty of wood. While the finish lasts for decades,
when it gets beat up and worn, it can be sanded, up to three or
four times, extending its life to generations. In this age of
throw-away floors with guarantees of a piddling 15 years, being
able to resand a floor is a plus.
</P>
<P>
   You'll know when your floor needs resanding and refinishing. The
finish is worn in places _ maybe the whole floor _ to the bare
wood, and some of those bare areas are weathered. In short, it is a
mess, scratched, pitted and gouged.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Old Aches and Pains
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For many years, refinishing a floor was hard, muscle-pulling
work. You rented a floor sander, a 200-pound monster with a sanding
drum that could pull you right across the room if you didn't hold
on for dear life. You also rented an edger because that big sucker
could not reach corners and edges. And, you had to sand three times
(with coarse, medium and fine paper).
</P>
<P>
   When you were through, you knew where every one of your muscles
were in your raggedy old body, because every one of them ached.
You'd agree if someone called you Old Aches and Pains.
</P>
<P>
   Then you applied three coats of varnish. With luck, results were
spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   Today, things are easier. You still have to sand three times,
but with a square-plate sander. It's as heavy as the old drum
sander, but it can be maneuvered virtually with one hand, with that
square plate vibrating, orbit-style. And, it can do edges and
corners.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just a little work . . .
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes your floors look a little beat up, dull and worn, with
a few light scratches and scuff marks. That is the floor you can
refurbish or renew, without competely sanding and refinishing.
</P>
<P>
   The time-honored way is to sand the floor by hand, with a medium
sandpaper to reduce gloss and roughen the finish, so a new coat of
varnish will adhere. Then wash with paint thinner. Finally, apply
one or two coats of a semigloss or high-gloss oil-based
polyurethane varnish.
</P>
<P>
   If you sand the floor by hand, it will look horrible, with all
kinds of sanding marks on it, but with a new coat of varnish, those
marks will disappear and (with luck) it will look great.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A new, easier way
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now comes a new way to restore and renew your floors if they are
not too far gone. It is called the Varathane Renewal Wood Floor
Restoring System, sold as a kit at home centers and hardware and
paint stores.
</P>
<P>
   The kit allows you to restore worn and dull floors just as some
of us did the old way, but there is an important difference: no
sanding, which is a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't find the kit, call 800-635-3286 for a source near
you.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, the kit is good for floors that are not too far gone,
those that are worn and dull, with scuff marks and light scratches
on the finish. The only prep work needed is to remove any wax by
washing with paint thinner.
</P>
<P>
   Floors with water stains, urine stains, pit marks, depressions
from table and chair legs, deep scratches and gouges in the wood,
not the finish, require complete sanding and refinishing.
</P>
<P>
   The Varathane kit costs $69.99 (good for a 15- by 15-foot room).
It's a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How it works
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The kit contains a quart of No-Sanding Formula solution, a quart
of Interloc Bonding Formula solution, Catalyzed Diamond Wood Finish
(124 ounces of topcoat and 4 ounces of catalyst), a scrubbing pad,
applicator block, and a synthetic lamb's wool pad.
</P>
<P>
   Step One uses the No-Sanding Formula, a liquid sandpaper that
conditions any finish, including polyurethane and other varnishes,
giving the finish ``tooth'' for other finishes to adhere to.
</P>
<P>
   Step Two uses the Interloc-Bonding Formula, which further
conditions the finish, to permanently bond with the new top coat.
</P>
<P>
   Step Three uses the Diamond Wood Finish, a water-based
polyurethane varnish strengthened by the addition of a catalyst
just before using. It hardens the finish and makes it more durable,
said Kristy Mayers, company spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
   You have to be careful with the water-based polyurethane, she
said, because it looks milky in the can and must be carefully
applied so it will not stay cloudy.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is water-based, the finish will not darken or yellow
over time
</P>
<P>
   Persons who prefer using a brush can do so in peace, said
Mayers.
</P>
<P>
   You can walk on the new finish in eight hours. You can return
furniture in three days. Heavy furniture should be kept off for
seven days until the finish is compeltely cured.
</P>
<P>
   And, contrary to many opinions, there is no need to add wax,
polish or anything else to this finished floor. Like any other
varnished floor, it is finished.
</P>
<P>
   By that time your floor will be good for lots more years, and
you can roll up your sleeves and do another room.
</P>

NIEMAN A BATTLEGROUND OF DETROIT NEWSPAPER WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In November 1995, a New York Times story on the early days of
Detroit's bitter newspaper strike warned that it had already
created ``immeasurable losses in diminished good will and growing
hard feelings.'' Nearly five years later, former Detroit News
editor and publisher Robert Giles can vouch for that.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, sources say Harvard University was ready to
name the 67-year-old Giles _ now vice president at the Freedom
Forum _ as the long-awaited successor to Nieman Foundation curator
Bill Kovach. But a concerted lobbying effort to derail his
candidacy by the unions and some journalists who joined the July
1995 strike appears to have delayed his appointment and perhaps
even caused a reassessment of that candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Although he left the News in 1997, the key issue is Giles's role
in Detroit's five-year labor battle and his fitness to run the
nation's most prestigious journalism fellowship program. If chosen,
Giles follows the much-admired Kovach, who ruffled corporate
feathers with his aggressive investigative instincts as former
editor of the Atlanta-Journal Constitution and who used the Nieman
post as a bully pulpit to loudly advocate for core journalistic
values. Neither Harvard nor Giles would comment Wednesday on the
specifics of the Nieman search.
</P>
<P>
   Giles's foes _ who accuse him of deliberately provoking the
unions as well as slanting the News' coverage of the strike _ say
his selection as curator would be an ``affront'' to those values.
Supporters see the former president of the American Society of
Newspaper Editors as the victim of a simmering vendetta, a sound
news executive who did his job under nearly impossible
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any personal feelings about any of the
individuals involved,'' although ``the strike was a very difficult
thing for me . . . very tough, very hostile,'' says Giles. Yet, he
was ``very surprised'' when the strike issue resurfaced in
connection with his Nieman candidacy because ``the issue of my role
in the strike has never been raised,'' in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   A Detroit reporter who is familiar with the situation but
requested anonymity is less stunned by this resumption of
hostilities. ``There's a great deal of ill will toward Bob Giles,''
he says. ``I don't know if it's justified. But I know it's real.''
</P>
<P>
   Robin Mather Jenkins, a former News food editor who went on
strike, says the idea of Giles getting the Harvard job is ``just
too disgusting . . . As the curator of the Nieman Foundation, he
represents the best and brightest in American journalism. His
actions during the strike indicates he's not the best guy to be in
that position.''
</P>
<P>
   Giles ``has a great reputation in the journalistic community and
deservedly so,'' counters Sandra Mims Rowe, editor of The
(Portland) Oregonian. ``For the Guild to organize an attack on his
candidacy based on the known difficulties of labor and management
disputes is unjust, given Giles's sustained and substantial
contributions to journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the old wounds and animosities at play here, the most
serious journalistic charge levelled is the fairly widespread
sentiment that the News produced biased, antiunion strike coverage
on its news pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We paid a lot of attention to how the strike was being
covered,'' Giles says. ``I thought (other media outlets') coverage
was focused mostly on coverage of people on the picket lines. . . .
But there was more to the story than that. In the early days of the
strike, there was a great deal of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Giles notes that striking workers made the News' job tougher by
declining to talk to the paper. But in 1995, The Columbia
Journalism Review gave the News (and its sister paper, The Detroit
Free Press) a ``dart'' for ``strikingly tilted'' coverage of the
strike. ``What readers got,'' the magazine said, ``were daily
bundles of stories, editorials, columns, photos, and ads pushing
the management line.''
</P>
<P>
   In a March 1996 Editor &AMP; Publisher story in which several
observers criticized the News' coverage as biased, Giles complained
that local broadcast outlets were guilty of pro-striker coverage
and acknowledged that ``to some extent, we feel the newspaper has
to balance the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Gonyea, the Detroit correspondent for National Public Radio,
says Giles ``was definitely very aggressive on making sure the
newspaper management's spin was out there on this . . . Giles was
the one to pick up the phone. He was definitely a lightning rod.''
</P>
<P>
   In temperament, the soft-spoken Giles doesn't seem much like a
lightning rod. And he says that ``a lot of decisions that were made
about the management of the strike,'' did not involve him. ``My job
was to keep producing a newspaper for those who wanted it'' and to
``preserve a professional'' environment for those who returned to
work, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Critics see it differently. During his ``tenure in Detroit,''
wrote Newspaper Guild President Linda K. Foley in a letter to
Harvard President Neil Rudenstine, ``Mr. Giles showed himself to be
committed not to high journalistic standards, but instead to the
corporate agenda of the Gannett Co.''
</P>
<P>
   Union members say their battles with Giles predate the 1995
strike. And a number of sources indicate that union-managment
relations began souring after the 1989 Joint Operating Agreement
that created a single business entity out of former rivals, the
Free Press and News.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man presided over the dismal decline of the Detroit
News,'' even before the labor strife, says Newspaper Guild of
Detroit president Lou Mleczko, who spent two dozen years as a News
reporter. One harbinger of the strike was a nasty 1994 battle
between the union and Giles over whether management could order
reporters to appear on a local television news show without any
agreement over compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry that we couldn't make it work better,'' says Giles
of the TV experiment, issuing what could pass as a post-mortem on
the larger labor war that raged at his paper.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Lacy, director of Michigan State University's School of
Journalism director, says Giles ``gets a lot of mixed reaction and
I have mixed reactions. Bob and I have disagreed on the strike. I
think it was a mistake on both sides (but) I suspect there are
people in the industry who have done things far worse than what Bob
did . . . It would not bother me as an academic to see Bob run that
(Nieman) program.''
</P>
<P>
   Like others, Lacy hints that Giles may not have been an ideal
fit ``at a big paper with a union'' at ground zero of the organized
labor universe. Now, with the unions galvanized and Giles's allies
organizing, the pressure intensifies on Harvard to determine
whether he's the right fit at the Nieman Foundation.

RIDING THE TIGER TO POWER: A TALE OF MAO'S WIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AMY GRAVES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
BECOMING MADAME MAO 
By Anchee Min 
Houghton Mifflin, 320 pp., $25 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Madame Mao Jiang Ching took a strange, often sad, and
unpredictable path to her role as the most powerful woman in
communist China.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Becoming Madame Mao,'' Anchee Min's second novel, she
starts as Yunhe, a girl of every possible disadvantage of poverty
and social ostracism. She is the daughter of a concubine, deepening
the difficulties she faces as a female in Chinese culture.
</P>
<P>
   At 18 Yunhe escapes an arranged marriage and runs away to
Shanghai, where she struggles to find work as an actress. She
finally stars in Ibsen's ``A Doll's House,'' and looks for more
acting jobs, but because she won't sleep with the directors she
gets nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   After two more failed marriages and a stint in jail for her
communist leanings, she takes a new name and gives up on acting. As
Lan Ping, she leaves Shanghai on a train bound for Mao's stronghold
in the remote countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Lan Ping pursues the communist leader when he's still hiding out
in Yenan, building his power base. It doesn't take long for Mao, in
turn, to pursue her. Mao is married, but he doesn't let that stand
in the way. Lan Ping has no sense of foreboding that what Mao did
for her he would be capable of doing again for the love of someone
else.
</P>
<P>
   She ends as Mao Jiang Ching, the ruler's wife compelled to
``ride the tiger'' _ the dangerous life she's chosen with Mao, who
turns out to be as elusive and contradictory in private as he is in
public.
</P>
<P>
   With letters, documents, and characters drawn from real life,
Min conjures a lyrical story that serves as an interpreted history
of Jiang Ching's rise and fall. Mesmerizing from page one, this
story neither romanticizes nor demonizes Jiang Ching, a compelling
character for whom it's hard not to feel sympathy, despite the
horrors she inflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Many passages are beautiful, and the ones describing her romance
with Mao suggest that long before Jiang Ching assumed power of her
own and began exacting revenge on her foes, she was a girl in love:
``It is the third time they meet privately. The stars look like
voyeurs' eyes opening and closing. Mao Tse-tung and Lan Ping stand
in the descending darkness, shoulder to shoulder. The day has begun
to cool. Weeds bend lazily over the riverbank. The reflection of
the moon trembles in the water.''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone can tell this story, it's Anchee Min. Having escaped
her fate as a worker on a Red Army farm to become an actress in one
of Jiang Ching's opera companies, and having escaped again to the
United States in 1984, Min knows her subject. Min gave her own
story in the 1994 ``Red Azalea,'' an autobiography that recounts
the hardships and deprivations that millions like her suffered in
the turbulent years during and after the Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Becoming Madame Mao'' opens with Jiang Ching awaiting her
death after 14 years in prison. She's telling the story of her life
to her daughter, Nah. ``Well, I won't surrender. When I was a child
my mother used to tell me that I should think of myself as grass _
born to be stepped on. But I think of myself as a peacock among
hens. I am not being judged fairly. Side by side Mao Tse-tung and I
stood, yet he is considered a god while I am a demon.''
Interspersed with passages from Nah's view (often contradictory to
her mother's), the narrative offers insight into Jiang Ching's
refusal to see her own shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Min adeptly links Jiang Ching's passion for theater to her
passion for the real drama of her public life. Jiang Ching sees
herself as an embattled heroine whose enemies are obscurity, the
comrades of Mao who tried to silence her, and finally Mao himself.
As Mao's power grows, he pushes Jiang Ching away and refuses to
grant her any status within his government. And then she learns
that Mao has syphillis from one of his many other sexual partners.
As her life with Mao proves lonely and difficult, her motivation
changes to consolidating power, imprisoning and executing her
opponents, and achieving immortality.
</P>
<P>
   She finally gets her opening after the debacle of the Great Leap
Forward, an effort launched in 1958 to industrialize China that
instead resulted in widespread famine, when Mao turns to his wife
for help. They work together to foment the Cultural Revolution, the
years of upheaval that cement Mao's grip on the nation in the late
'60s and early '70s. But Jiang Ching's own position remains
precarious, and she never overcomes detractors within the shifting
circles of power.
</P>
<P>
   Without ignoring her crimes, Min never lets go of the image of
Jiang Ching as a vulnerable woman. The result is a testament to the
complexity behind even the most brutal characters, and a lesson in
the soul's potential for shaping its destiny.

THIS JESUS READS NIETZSCHE, PLACES PERSONAL ADS ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Big surprise. There's a guy on the Internet who calls himself
Jesus and is advertising for a mate. He sports golden locks,
dresses in a flowing robe, and claims to have ``a lean swimmer's
body and a six pack.'' On his Web site, www.jesus.com, he's
offering ladies a chance to shower with him as a ``lasting tribute
to. . .cleanliness.''
</P>
<P>
   Right. So is this the work of a pornographer, a performance
artist, or a postmodern poseur?
</P>
<P>
   This much we know. When ``Jesus'' returns queries, he calls back
collect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a joke,'' says the fellow calling collect from Falls
Church, Va. He describes himself as a 26-year-old college graduate
who changed his name to Jesus a few years ago. He claims to be
gainfully employed _ ``I generate intellectual property'' _ and
swears that the Web site is ``totally legitimate.'' He also attests
that he has no interest in money or organized religion, for that
matter.
</P>
<P>
   So what's up with the Web site? ``I love women immensely, and
I'm looking for a good one,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Pardon the skepticism, Jesus, but there have been too many
online hoaxes for anyone to believe unconditionally. Who are you?
What is your motive?
</P>
<P>
   ``I experiment with various things,'' he says. Well, so did
Timothy Leary. Can you be a little more specific? ``I don't want to
get into past projects.''
</P>
<P>
   That's about all you're going to get from the self-described
spiritualist who favors long romantic walks and the philosophy of
Nietzsche and Schopenhauer. (Nothing like a little nihilism on the
beach!) His ``sermons'' are semi-coherent, anti-corporate screeds,
although the site also boasts pictures of ``Jesus'' endorsing
Starbucks, Guinness, and Barbie. (Go figure.)
</P>
<P>
   In this age of privacy violation, a guy who goes around dressed
as Jesus is paranoid about revealing personal details: ``I don't
want people showing up at my house in the middle of the night,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't the only cryptic fellow associated with the site. The
domain name is registered to Tor Manders, a 34-year-old
Washington-based programmer who says he registered the name several
years ago. Manders says he leases the site to Jesus. A few months
ago, the site featured chat and discussion boards for Christians;
the personal ad went up last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have anything to do with the content,'' says Manders,
not once but twice. ``I'd actually prefer not to have anything to
do with it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Manders can confirm that the photos on the site are real and
that the fellow looking for a mate does have a full-time job,
doesn't smoke, and only drinks socially. (He can't comment on the
``six-pack,'' though.) As for the shower offer, he's not sure what
that's all about. ``The shower thing seems to indicate, um, that
it's humor.'' A pause. ``On the other hand, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Wong,'' an animated Web series on www.icebox.com, is
generating a fair share of controversy online. The title character
is a slant-eyed, buck-toothed butler who works for a self-centered
society girl, stereotypical enough to draw the ire of
Asian-Americans and members of the Junior League alike. In fact,
the show has been excoriated on the community site,
www.asianavenue.com, and the Icebox message boards have been
bombarded by fans and critics of the show.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, the most offensive thing about ``Mr. Wong'' is
that it's just not funny. Unlike the hilariously irreverent ``South
Park,'' whose politically incorrect characters are rooted in
contemporary life, ``Mr. Wong'' seems to take place in a time warp,
featuring a bumbling majordomo obsessed with Bing Crosby. The first
two episodes, titled ``Urine Trouble'' (get it? ha ha), are about
the valet's exploits at Graceland. See Mr. Wong urinate on Elvis
Presley's grave. Hear him mix up his l's and r's. Watch him teeter
around on little feet. Are we supposed to be laughing? And what's
up with that accent? It makes Charlie Chan sound downright British.
</P>
<P>
   The show does have one genuinely uproarious moment; too bad it
comes in the opening disclaimer that warns audiences about
offensive content, including ``racially inflammatory material. . .
tired vaudevillian schtick, vomiting, and rude nicknames.'' It does
promise that there are ``almost no portrayals of cannibalism.''
Maybe that would have been funny.

   The most recent wrinkle in the recording industry's battle
against online music piracy is a lawsuit against www.mp3board, an
MP3 search engine. But after a visit to the site, it's hard to
imagine what all the fuss is about. The links on the site lead to
other MP3 sites that display an endless series of pop-up windows,
similar to those that show up on porn sites. The pop-up windows
make it nearly impossible to download music. ``That's probably a
bug,'' says Ira Rothken, MP3board.com's attorney. ``It's not the
intention of the design to make it an annoying experience.''

   You heard it here first: Musicbank.com may come up with a whole
new concept _ the instant bootleg. The company, which sells custom
compilation CDs, is sponsoring the summer tour of The Who and Jimmy
Page and The Black Crows, which play the Tweeter Center next week.
Recordings of the shows may end up on musicmaker.com, says Larry
Lieberman, the company's president of global marketing. ``We could
take a concert by any artist and put it up on the site the next day
for sale anywhere in the world,'' he says. ``The concept is, `Leave
your microphones at home. We'll get the board mix for you.' '' But
that would be legal, and that wouldn't be any fun at all.

   This week, a coalition including Blockbuster, MP3.com, and Yahoo
launched www.whowantstobeamoviestar.com, a scheme that would allow
regular Joes and Judys to bid for the chance to play roles in a
yet-to-be-scripted movie. Under the original plan, aspiring stars
would bid for the roles on Yahoo's auction site; the winning
bidders would be appear in a film by screenwriter Adam Rifkin. The
film will be distributed by Blockbuster, and MP3.com will select
the bands for the soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   After folks began placing bids, the California Labor Commission
intervened. It turns out that it is illegal to require a fee from a
job applicant. Whoops. The group revised its plan; now actors must
have others (like proud Aunt Selma) bid for them, acting as
sponsors. The film hasn't been named yet. How about: ``Who Wants to
Be a Labor Lawyer?''

   Speaking of reality programming, the Net is abuzz with theories

people have way too much time on their hands.

<P>
   NEW BEDFORD, Mass. _ The scene was remarkable, as hundreds of
camera-toting spectators and scientists gathered on Second Beach in
Middletown, R.I. to watch history unfold.
</P>
<P>
   A giant blue whale sat impaled across the bow of a ship, its
eyes bulging and skin torn away. The 66-foot whale _ so rare that
one like it hadn't been seen on the East Coast for 100 years _ had
been struck by a tanker in a wild ocean storm and dragged hundreds,
if not thousands, of miles across the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Even as gawkers approached the carcass, officials at the New
Bedford Whaling Museum began an intense battle to claim the bones.
Under pressure from US Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and US Rep. Barney
Frank, the National Marine Fisheries Service awarded care of the
whale's skeleton to the museum, over other institutions including
the Smithsonian Institution and the University of Massachusetts at
Amherst.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were extremely excited,'' said Anne Brengle, executive
director of the Museum. ``New Bedford is a major whaling center so
it makes sense that the whale is here.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, after a painstaking two years spent piecing the bones back
together, the mammal's skeletal remains will be on display at the
museum beginning Friday _ making it one of only three locations in
the country where the public can view a complete blue whale.
</P>
<P>
   The 55-ton species, which scientists believe was between four
and six years old when it was killed, was towed to a Middletown
beach by bulldozers in March, 1998. Its ribs, vertebrae and
shoulder on the left side were broken, apparently from the impact
with the tanker.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were so many people at the beach it was incredible,''
said Lee Heald, director of programs at the Whaling Museum who
first pitched the idea to Museum officials about requesting the
skeleton. ``I took my children. It was something that was important
for them to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-seven scientists huddled around the animal to take
samples of blood, skin, organs and other tissues for future study.
</P>
<P>
   The whale's carcass was then taken to a New Bedford landfill
where volunteers and city crews guarded the skeleton throughout the
night until the flesh and blubber could be stripped from the bones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was amazing. Everyone came together to make sure this
would happen here in New Bedford,'' said New Bedford's Mayor
Frederick M. Kalisz, Jr. ``It was a fantastic feeling.'' The whale
- which has been named KOBO - King of the Blue Ocean - by sixth
grader Katie Hallett, has rallied the city, which has seen some
hard financial times over the past few decades. ``The city is
really undergoing a renassiance,'' Kalisz said. ``This exhibit was
a public-private partnership. It was a phenomenal achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   The skeleton's debut comes just as museum officials are
celebrating an $11 million renovation and expansion project of its
current facility, and as 50,000 tourists stream through the city
for the annual Summerfest weekend.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second whale that adorns the two-and-a-half story
gallery of the museum. Next to the blue whale skeleton, which is
suspended from the ceiling, is a 33-foot humpback whale skeleton
which has been housed at the facility since the mid-1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Konnerth, a biologist and expert in the field of mammal
skeleton rearticulation, worked with his wife Jean to reassembled
the blue whale skeleton.
</P>
<P>
   The process, somewhat akin to constructing the world's largest
jigsaw puzzle, took more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the eighth whale that I've done,'' said Konnerth, who
was commissioned by the museum from his home in Texas. ``What was
important, was that we had to make sure that we kept everything
intact.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists estimate that there are only about 300 blue whales in
the North Atlantic and 4,000 in the whole world. They can swim as
fast as 22 mph. But they don't reproduce very often _ every two to
three years at most.
</P>
<P>
   The heart alone weighs three-quarters of a ton.
</P>
<P>
   Museum officials estimate that the entire display cost about
$350,000. That investment is worth it, they say, because of the
thousands of new visitors they expect to lure into the facility.

   BOSTON _ His every note a triumph over disability and fate, Tad
Lietz brought tears to the eyes of Shriners Wednesday as he gently
played the theme from the film ``Titanic'' on his cello, drawing
the bow across the strings with his left foot because he was born
without a left arm.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve-year-old Lietz, who played for the Shriners at their
national convention in Boston, was abandoned shortly after birth
and left on the steps of a crowded orphanage in Ho Chi Minh City in
Vietnam. He spent the first three years of his life there.
</P>
<P>
   He moved from a crib resting on a dirt floor to Appleton, Wis.,
at age 3, when he was adopted by Mary and Jeffrey Lietz.
</P>
<P>
   The Shriners, an international fraternity that supports a
network of hospitals offering free care to patients, have helped
Tad Lietz to begin to realize his lifelong dream of becoming a
famous cellist, his mother said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you Shriners for believing in children, and helping us
to teach our children to believe in themselves,'' Mary Lietz told
the crowd at the Hynes Memorial Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our minds, angels wear red fezzes.''
</P>
<P>
   When Tad Lietz first came to the United States he weighed 16
pounds, had trouble seeing, couldn't sit up or walk, and screamed
through the night, his mother said. His ear was infected due to
insect bites.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Shriners read a story about Tad in the Lietzes'
local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we knew it, men came to our door and said they
represented the local Shriners,'' said Mary Lietz. The men told her
and her husband they could help their son.
</P>
<P>
   The Lietzes accepted the help and Tad's father is now a member
of the Shriners.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Tad Lietz has gotten free treatment and therapy from
a Shriners Hospital in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   But he cannot use his prosthetic arm to play the cello. So Lietz
had to learn to finger the instrument's strings with his right hand
and move the bow with his foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look inside,'' Tad Lietz said after the concert
Wednesday, ``you really don't have a disability.''
</P>
<P>
   Lietz is now enrolled in programs for gifted and talented
children. He is an accomplished soccer player and chess teacher.
``You only have one life,'' he said. ``Make it useful.''
</P>
<P>
   Lietz's performance was a surprise gift to the Shriners, many of
whom were moved by the presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Knauss, 66, the wife of retired Shriner Earl Knauss of
Buffalo, N.Y., said the sweet cello tones of the song ``My Heart
Will Go On'' made her feel proud of the work the Shriners do. She
was so filled with emotion that tears streamed from her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what it's all about _ helping kids,'' she said.
``We're part of a great organization that helps these children.''
</P>
<P>
   After Lietz finished playing, another Shriners patient,
18-year-old C.J. Williams from Panama City, Fla., thanked the
organization for giving her life.
</P>
<P>
   She had suffered burns over 70 percent of her body in a fire
when she was a young girl, but was treated at the burn unit of a
Shriners Hospital in Galveston, Texas. Now she leads an active
life, physically and socially.
</P>
<P>
   Shriners president Ralph Semb said Lietz and Williams are living
examples of the miracles the organization makes happen.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to the pair, Semb said: ``Those are our stars.''

CASTLE ENERGY TO EXPLORE 'STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES' 
</HEADLINE>
   By SARAH RUBENSTEIN   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Castle Energy (CECX:Nasdaq) announced Thursday that it would
explore ``strategic alternatives,'' including sale of its oil and
gas properties, a merger with another company or a corporate
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   The Radnor, Pa.-based company made this decision because the
stock prices of small-capitalization exploration companies,
including Castle, failed to climb proportionally with the rise in
oil and gas prices, Joseph L. Castle II, Castle's chairman and
chief executive, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Spectrum Advisors, a Dallas-based oil and gas investment
banking firm, will advise Castle Energy in the venture.
</P>
<P>
   Castle Energy owns oil and gas interests in about 530 wells in
10 states in the U.S., and operates about half of the wells. It
also has a 50 percent interest in three oil and gas concessions in
Romania.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Castle Energy jumped 15/16, or 15 percent, to 7 1/8 in
Thursday midday trading.

 cOMPAQ, IBM INK STORAGE NETWORKING DEAL  
 By JENNIFER BARRETT   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Compaq Computer (CPQ:NYSE) and International Business Machines
(IBM:NYSE) announced Thursday that they would begin selling each
other's products and would make their storage hardware and software
interoperable.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies, the world's largest suppliers of computing
systems and information technology, plan to invest more than $1
billion under the new deal and to share some of their research to
create new industry-wide standards for storage networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vendors who continue to promote proprietary systems and
standards will find themselves increasingly isolated,'' said Linda
Sanford, general manager of IBM's storage subsystems division,
calling the new agreement ``a game-changing play.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay P. Stevens, an analyst at Buckingham Research Group in New
York, called the announcement ``very positive'' for each company in
the long run, even if it was not reflected immediately in the stock
prices. ``They've put a stake in the ground laying claim to a
bigger piece of this very big market.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, IDC Consulting projects worldwide revenue for disk
storage systems and storage management software will climb to $53
billion by the year 2003. IBM and Compaq's new agreement helps them
compete head-on with EMC (EMC:NYSE), the leading maker of mainframe
computer disk memory hardware and software. The Hopkinton,
Mass.-based company derives 80 percent of its total sales from
storage hardware sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the explosion of e-business and consumer demand for
anytime-anywhere products and services, storage plays an
increasingly vital role in our customers' Internet
infrastructure,'' said Howard Elias, vice president and general
manager of Compaq's storage global business unit. ``This agreement
assures both companies' customers a complete portfolio of critical
storage technologies that will work seamlessly with future Compaq
and IBM products.''
</P>
<P>
   Under their agreement, Compaq, which is based in Houston, will
add IBM's ``Shark'' enterprise storage servers and select Tivoli
systems management software to its portfolio of products. IBM will
add Compaq storageworks modular array storage systems and software,
and include its 10,000 RPM hard disk drives in the systems.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement came as the investment firm Bear Stearns announced
that it had cut its estimates for IBM's second-quarter earnings
because it was concerned that the company's mainframe hardware and
software sales would fall short of expectations. IBM, which is
based in Armonk, N.Y., is the world's leading provider of mainframe
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Bear Stearns analysts lowered their estimates for IBM's earnings
to 97 cents a share from $1.02. Still, the revised estimate is 6
cents higher than last year's second-quarter earnings. IBM is
scheduled to report its earnings on July 19. The consensus among
Wall Street analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial is $1
per share.
</P>
<P>
   Bear Stearns, which has had an underwriting relationship with
IBM over the past three years, maintains a buy rating on the
company's stock as it expects revenue to rebound in the second half
of the year with the introduction of a new server line, an increase
in the company's services business, and potential for the PC
business to become profitable again.
</P>
<P>
   In a quarterly earnings preview released Wednesday, Deutsche
Bank projected earnings of $1 a share for IBM for the second
quarter, despite ongoing concerns of sluggish mainframe computer
demand.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank estimated second-quarter earnings of 20 cents a
share for Compaq, citing concerns over its top-line estimate.
That's slightly lower than the consensus earnings estimates of 21
cents per share reported by First Call/ Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank noted the company's struggle to break even in the
corporate PC business, internal turmoil caused by the reshuffling
of high-level executives and pressure from Hewlett-Packard
(HWP:NYSE) and other computer makers on its consumer PC business.
Deutsche Bank does not underwrite either company's stock and does
not rate either company.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's shares were down 3/8, or 1 percent, at 24 5/8 in
Thursday midday trading. IBM's stock was trading down 3 3/8, or 3
percent, at 101 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of EMC were down 15/16, or 1 percent, at 74 11/16.

MAY FACTORY ORDERS JUMP 4.1 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN VAMES   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Orders for goods made in U.S. factories rose 4.1 percent in May,
the biggest monthly gain since December 1992, as demand picked up
for such big-ticket items as electrical and electronic equipment
and transportation-related products.
</P>
<P>
   Factory orders, a measure of demand for U.S.-manufactured goods,
rose to $385.7 billion in May, the Commerce Department said
Thursday. The rise offset the weakness seen in April, when orders
fell 3.8 percent, to $370.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The data came as a slight surprise to economists, who had been
expecting a 3.4 percent rise in orders, according to a Reuters
poll.
</P>
<P>
   The pickup in May orders was propelled by a 26.4 percent surge
in demand for electrical and electronic equipment, a broad category
that includes machinery, appliances and high-tech electronics.
Orders in that area had slumped 17.6 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
   Orders for transportation-related equipment also picked up 3.3
percent in May after dropping 6.3 percent in April. Excluding the
transportation component, which is often volatile because it
includes such hugely expensive products as airplanes and ships,
factory orders rose 4.3 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, orders for durable goods -- items meant to last at
least three years -- rose 6.1 percent following April's 5.8 percent
decline. Nondurable goods orders were up 1.7 percent after falling
1.2 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
   There is some evidence that factory orders moderated in June. A
survey by the National Association of Purchasing Management,
released Monday, suggested that manufacturing activity slowed in
June, largely due to slower growth in new orders for manufactured
goods.
</P>
<P>
   But the solid rebound in demand for manufactured goods in May is
likely to cause skepticism about the degree to which the U.S.
economy is slowing. The April drop in factory orders, along with
similar declines in April retail sales, housing market activity and
May job creation, had started to convince some economists that the
Federal Reserve's efforts to raise interest rates were slowing the
U.S. economy. In theory, higher interest rates slow demand by
making it more costly for consumers and businesses to borrow and
spend, decreasing the risk of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised rates six times in the past year, but held
rates steady at its most recent meeting on June 28, citing
``tentative and preliminary'' signs of an economic slowdown. But
many economists expect that the Fed will continue to raise rates
when it meets next in August, saying that economic growth still
appears to be well above the historical trend.
</P>
<P>
   Other measures of the economy Thursday also pointed to further
strength. A separate report from the Labor Department showed that
the number of Americans registering for first-time unemployment
benefits fell 12,000 to 296,000 in the week ended July 1. The Labor
Department will release its monthly unemployment and payrolls data
for June on Friday morning.

GAP WARNS OF EARNINGS SHORTFALL; SEARS TO EXCEED EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL BRICK   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gap(GPS:NYSE) warned Thursday that its earnings would fall short
of analysts' expectations, while Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co.(S:NYSE) said
its earnings would exceed Wall Street's forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   The clothing retailers both issued new guidance to analysts
after compiling their monthly sales figures.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco-based Gap, which is due to post second-quarter
earnings on Aug. 10, said it now expects to report 23 cents a
share, 3 cents below the consensus estimates reported by First
Call/Thomson Financial, which polled 22 brokerage firms. The
company earned 22 cents a share in the second quarter of last year.
The Gap's earnings warning followed other profit warnings earlier
this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Sears said its chairman, Arthur C. Martinez, ``expressed
confidence'' that the company's earnings would ``exceed current
consensus expectations with earnings per share over the same period
last year of at least 20 to 25 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman Estates, Ill.-based Sears has been expected to earn 99
cents a share in the quarter, according to the consensus estimate
of 14 brokerage firms surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. The
retailer earned 86 cents a share in its second quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's comments should be interpreted to mean the company
will earn between $1.03 to $1.08 a share, a company spokeswoman
said. Sears has not yet decided when it will report earnings for
the quarter ended June 30, according to Leah Mangum, a
representative of Sear's investor relations department.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the projected shortfall, shares of the Gap gained 2 1/8,
or 7 percent, to 32 in midmorning trading. The company said that
sales for June were $1.17 billion, an increase of 19 percent over
sales of $977 million in June 1999. But gross margins fell, causing
the earnings disappointment, according to the company. The company
operated 3,224 stores this year, compared with 2,630 last year, an
increase of 23 percent. On average, each store booked $362,903 in
sales in June, compared with $371,482 in June 1999. The same-store
sales decline was 2 percent, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Gap said it does not expect the shortfall to affect the
following two quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Sears shares gained 11/16, or 2.03 percent, to 34 1/2. The
company said June domestic store revenues were $2.8 billion, an
increase of 3.6 percent over the $2.71 billion reported for the
same period last year. Comparable store sales gained 2.3 percent.

<P>
   LAKE GEORGE, N.Y. _ Can you judge a lake by its surface?
</P>
<P>
   Divers in Lake George looked deep into the water and found
pieces of whole worlds: more than 60 shipwrecks lay forgotten in
the lake's southernmost tip alone, and elsewhere under the 32-mile
length of clear water, submerged vessels remain to be counted.
</P>
<P>
   The discoveries were made by divers taking a first-ever
inventory of the lake bottom _ an effort to catalog the historic
treasures before they are picked over by adventure seekers and
disappear. Volunteer divers, part of Bateaux Below Inc. of Saratoga
Springs, began the formal inventory five years ago, inspired by the
region's Colonial history and by several significant discoveries
made in the past three decades. The work is expected to take
another decade or more.
</P>
<P>
   Along the lake bottom divers have already found a collection of
French and Indian War remains rivaled in the Northeast only by the
shipwrecks of Lake Champlain. And one of Bateaux Below's recent
discoveries _ a British warship known as a ``radeau'' _ is so rare
that it is now among just six shipwrecks registered as National
Historic Landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   When their inventory is complete, Bateaux Below divers hope to
find wrecks spanning the history of European wars and fresh-water
recreation that has long centered on Lake George. But they also
hope their work will foster a new respect for submerged
archaeology. With discovery comes increased curiosity. And that,
combined with the growing popularity of diving, is bringing
increased threats to the remains in this watery grave.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inventory will help us manage what's down there,'' said
Joe Zarzynski, executive director of Bateaux Below and a diver who
has spent countless hours in Lake George. Something needs to be
done, Zarzynski said, ``to take the diving pressure off'' the
popular wrecks and help preserve them for the next few centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Long as they have been there, the artifacts in New York's famous
lake were mostly undisturbed until the past three decades and the
advent of modern scuba diving in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Some early finds were recorded: in 1903 a slooplike vessel was
found in 15 feet of water off a steamboat dock. It was hauled out
of the lake and cut up for souvenirs, according to written
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   With scuba gear, divers could look deeper _ and stay longer.
Anyone could join the adventure just by learning to dive, so there
was less incentive to raise the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   The first major discovery was made in 1960 when two teen-age
divers found what turned out to be 14 British bateaux _
flat-bottomed vessels that were used in the French and Indian War
to move troops fast. The British Army had developed a practice of
building boats and then submerging them with rocks, hiding their
fleet from any French marauders who might raid Fort William Henry
over winter. In the spring, the vessels would be raised from their
``wet storage'' by divers.
</P>
<P>
   In the winter of 1758, however, some of the 260 submerged
bateaux slipped out of reach. The 14 boats found in 1960, each
about 30 feet long, were in neat rows as if deliberately placed,
but forgotten or lost in 25 to 50 feet of water.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the British were hiding more than bateaux. In 1990,
Zarzynski led a group of divers into 107 feet of water to the wreck
of a British radeau _ a seven-sided floating fortress armed with
cannons. Radeaux were used almost exclusively as artillery ships,
and fewer of them were built.
</P>
<P>
   The 52-foot wreck of the radeau _ known as the Land Tortoise _
that Zarzynski's team found is the oldest completely intact warship
ever found in the Western Hemisphere and the only radeau known to
exist.
</P>
<P>
   The last historic reference to the ship was made in October
1758, when it was taken for a test sail shortly after it was built.
The ship was then submerged, but apparently its size made it
difficult to control. It slipped under the surface and disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably the biggest `Oh no!' ever heard,'' said
Zarzynski, who has pieced together a story that the Colonials
failed to record.
</P>

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists have made careful studies of the 18th-century
ships found in Lake George, and have learned over the years that
preservation beats raising the wrecks piecemeal.
</P>
<P>
   A 1965 State Police dive to the bateaux site, for example,
raised boxes of relics, but they weren't properly recorded and
documented.
</P>
<P>
   Some wreck divers have piracy on their minds. Lake George
attracts divers accustomed to the rules of the ocean, where,
outside a three-mile limit, any wreck is fair game for looting.
</P>
<P>
   Inland, the law forbids removing artifacts from the water. But
archaeologists say looting has nonetheless caused irreversible
damage to the historic sites, which are well-preserved in cold
water but are extremely vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early days of diving it was pretty much an accepted
fact that people could go down there and take what they wanted,''
said Bob Benway, a Bateaux Below diver. ``It was very common for
people to just take a piece of railing off the wreck'' or some
other piece of rigging, even a section of wood, as a souvenir.
</P>
<P>
   More often, though, the wrecks are simply loved to death.
</P>
<P>
   The bateaux and radeau were stripped of most articles before
they were deliberately scuttled. But it doesn't take much to harm
242-year-old vessels: Divers who try to get an underneath-look at
the radeau can disturb the wood simply with their bubbles. Anchors
have been dropped on the wrecks. A diver's momentary loss of
control might mean bumping into the gunnels, and just that can be
jarring enough to cause damage.
</P>
<P>
   Bateaux Below divers believe the best way to preserve the wrecks
is to create a series of educational sites, or ``submerged heritage
preserves,'' to attract divers and to educate and train them. So
far three such sites have been established: The ``Underwater
Fleet'' site (where the bateaux lay alongside one submerged
replica) was opened in 1993, along with an ``underwater classroom''
set up at the site of a sunken tour boat, known as the Forward,
that is believed to have been scuttled in the 1930s. The radeau
site (for advanced divers because of its extreme depth) was opened
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Each site is marked with buoys and provided with moorings to
protect the wrecks from anchors. Underwater informational signs
lead divers through the sites and, in the Forward underwater
classroom, stations provide experiments and training exercises.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to set up scenarios where divers practice before
diving on sites,'' Zarzynski said. That takes the pressure off
historic landmarks that can't be guarded by rangers, watched in the
busy season or closed off with gates after hours.
</P>
<P>
   Bateaux Below hopes to create more submerged preserves. The
group is entering the fifth year of its mile-by-mile inventory with
the help of grant money, sonar and global positioning equipment,
and hopes to find an appropriate site for a new park somewhere
midlake.
</P>
<P>
   They want another site because, in history book drawings, the
ships look old. But to come upon a radeau sunk in 100 feet of fresh
dark water feels, to some, like finding God.
</P>
<P>
   A thin light grazes the mossy beams of the warship, long settled
in the mud and silence. ``It's like diving in a cathedral,''
Zarzynski said. ``It's religious.''

   LAKE GEORGE, N.Y. _ In September 1999, a storm hit Lake George
that wasn't quite as perfect as the one you can watch at the movies
these days, but for an inland tempest, it was as good as they get.
</P>
<P>
   State authorities who oversee Lake George say 150 boats were
sunk when Tropical Storm Floyd was over, and all have been
recovered. Divers, however, say it might have been more like 200.
</P>
<P>
   That difference of 50 boats is the stuff lake-bottom lore is
made of.
</P>
<P>
   If any boats sunk last fall remain under water, none have been
spotted _ and with big fines likely, any owner of a still-swamped
boat would probably prefer to keep it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the notion persists that a bevy of cabin cruisers are
waiting to be found, at rest among the sloops, the treasure chests
and even the sea monsters that live in the imaginations of lake
watchers.
</P>
<P>
   What is true, however, is that over the centuries ships have
gone down to storms and in battles; others were deliberately
scuttled in the days before strict laws forbade such sinkings.
</P>
<P>
   One vessel, a 15-foot homemade submarine built to study French
and Indian War wrecks, was stolen from its dock in 1960 before it
even made a trial run. Its fate was one of the lake's big mysteries
until 1995, when Bateaux Below divers found the rusted hulk in deep
water, midlake. Mystery half-solved: No one can say how it got
there.
</P>
<P>
   Bateaux Below, a Saratoga Springs-based diving group that
studies Lake George, has undertaken a lake-bottom inventory that
might, over the next decade or so, take the guesswork out of many
such tales of the deep. But here are some mysteries that endure:
</P>
<P>
   _ In the deep water along the ``narrows'' at midlake, a 60-foot
sailing vessel with a 65-foot mast is believed to be submerged, its
sides collapsed, an open safe lying next to the wreck. Its
existence is not confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   _ It is said that a treasure chest was found by two divers south
of Diamond Island, near where the Forward wreck lies. Divers say
the chest is sunk in 120 feet of water and some continue to search
for it today, but others note that waters off the island do not
exceed 110 feet.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the 1850s, a storm took down a three-mast sailing vessel
(known as a ``bark'') in the middle of the lake with its full crew
aboard. One man jumped off before the storm became too powerful,
and lived to tell a tale of violent winds and a crew member who
tied himself to the mast to ride out the storm. The ship has never
been found.
</P>
<P>
   _ The British vessel Halifax, a sloop-of-war, disappeared and
may be somewhere in Lake George. Over 50 feet long, it participated
in both the 1758 Abercrombie expedition and the 1759 Amherst
expedition. Some historians believe it was dragged ashore and left
to rot.
</P>
<P>
   _ What ever became of the Ganouskie? The steamboat was a lake
attraction in the mid-19th century, then retired and moored at Big
Burnt Island, where it was a floating bar. When the bar failed, it
is said the ship was scuttled in deep water off Dome Island, near
Bolton Landing.
</P>
<P>
   Divers are still making discoveries in Lake George. But surely,
some of the wrecks that divers hunt for never did exist. And with
the Bateaux Below survey poised to identify everything on the lake
floor, those nonexistent wrecks may be the most thrilling to hunt
for in years to come _ for divers who thrive on mystery.

MARINE MISCONDUCT IN OKINAWA PROMPTS A GENERAL'S APOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The top U.S. military official in Okinawa apologized
profusely Thursday for an incident on Monday in which a U.S. Marine
allegedly entered a private residence on the southern Japanese
island and sexually molested a 14-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   In a remarkable display of remorse, Marine Corps Lt. Gen. Earl
B. Hailston visited Okinawa Gov. Keiichi Inamine at the prefecture
government's office to make a formal apology, which included a
Japanese bow of contrition. The general was accompanied by the U.S.
consul-general of Okinawa, Robert Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said that it was the first time that a
senior U.S. military official had made such a direct apology,
despite numerous cases of violence and sexual misconduct involving
U.S. soldiers stationed in Okinawa in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The general's apology is seen as an effort to smooth relations
with the people of Okinawa, who have held angry rallies and
protests over the incident in recent days, in advance of a summit
meeting of world leaders that President Clinton is scheduled to
attend this month on the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to express to the family involved, as well as to the
people of Okinawa, my sincerest apology and most profound regret
for the incident and for the anxiety it has created,'' said
Hailston, who is the regional coordinator for U.S. military forces
in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relationship of a Marine leader to his subordinate Marines
is like the relationship of a father to his children; these Marines
are my sons and daughters,'' the general said. ``That is why it
hurts me deeply when any of my Marines appears to fall short of the
standard I have set and demand. It hurts me, as it hurts you, my
neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   The general's remarks underscore the widespread fear and concern
that exists in Okinawa over sex crimes committed by U.S. troops
stationed there since World War II. Japanese and Western historians
have said that in the aftermath of the war, U.S. troops raped
thousands of Okinawan women without reprisals. The historians said
that while hundreds of rape cases have been documented, most went
unreported for fear of retaliation and shame.
</P>
<P>
   Outrage against the U.S. military in Okinawa reached a climax in
1995 when islanders held massive protests after three U.S.
servicemen were convicted of kidnapping and raping a 12-year-old
Japanese girl there.
</P>
<P>
   Hailston's apology Thursday was also exceptional because the
accused Marine has not yet been charged with a crime, although he
remains in Okinawa police custody. The 19-year-old Marine, whose
name has been withheld because he is a minor under Japanese law, is
accused of breaking into the junior high school girl's home and
touching her body while she slept early Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   After the girl's mother reported the incident to police, the
Marine, who is stationed at the Air Station Futenma in Ginowan,
Okinawa, was arrested at the scene on suspicion of trespassing and
conducting an indecent act against a minor.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the Marine was drunk during the incident and that he had told
the police he meant to visit a friend's house but entered the
girl's residence by mistake. They said the door to the home was
unlocked, as is the custom of many Okinawans. The police officials
said the Marine has denied molesting the girl. Evening newspapers
in Okinawa reported Thursday that the girl had told the police that
the Marine had touched her face and body and climbed on top of her.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Since Monday's arrest, labor unions, peace activists, women's
rights groups and human rights organizations have rallied near U.S.
bases and sent letters of protest to the prefectural government.
Some local city mayors canceled their scheduled appearances at a
Fourth of July celebration held at the U.S. consulate in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   The general's comments appear to have done little to quell
growing outrage in Okinawa over the incident, which could prove
extremely embarrassing to Clinton, who is scheduled to attend the
summit meeting of the G7 nations from July 21-23.
</P>
<P>
   Protest leaders vowed to hold follow-up demonstrations and to
use this latest incident to stir anti-base sentiment. The Peace
Action Center Okinawa, a group of union and progressive party
activists, plans to form a human chain around the Kadena Air Base
in Okinawa on July 20, the eve of the summit meeting of the world's
leading industrialized nations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Distrust and frustration of Okinawan people against the
American military has never been higher,'' said Eiji Miyahira, a
member of the Okinawa Prefectural Assembly, which passed a
resolution condemning the incident. The Okinawa police have asked
the U.S. military to impose a curfew and ban on drinking alcohol
outside bases late at night.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of world War II, Okinawa was the site of a fierce
battle between Japanese and U.S. soldiers in which more than 200,00
people, including civilians, were killed. Under the 1951 peace
treaty, Okinawa was placed under the authority of the U.S.
military, which established vast bases on the island. Okinawa
reverted to Japanese rule in 1972, but the U.S. bases remained.
</P>
<P>
   Okinawans have long complained that noise and vibrations from
military aircraft, combat and ammunitions exercises and rude and
drunken soldiers jeopardize not only their pastoral way of life but
also their safety. Island residents regularly hold massive protests
demanding a reduction in the number of U.S. bases, which take up
one-fifth of the island's land.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the war and after Okinawa reverted back to Japan, we had
high hopes that these rapes would stop,'' said Keiko Itokazu, an
Okinawa Prefectural Assembly member. ``But now this case happens to
this girl in her own house, which is supposed to be the safest
place. In Okinawa, women are not even safe to sleep in our own
houses. This is unbearable.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Kurt S. Owermohle, a spokesman for the Marine Corps in
Okinawa, said that the U.S. military was cooperating fully with the
local police investigation. ``We are deeply sorry that an incident
such as this has occurred, and the people of Okinawa certainly have
a right to be angry over this.''
</P>
<P>
   Owermohle said the incident was especially disappointing because
the Marine Corps had undertaken numerous educational and leadership
efforts in recent years to improve relations between U.S. troops
and Okinawans.

that the war in Chechnya is over, Chechen rebel leaders have
launched a new round of deadly attacks on the Russian army.
Throughout the 10-month-old war, the rebels have evaded Russian
attacks by holing up in secretive headquarters in the snow-capped
Caucausus mountains and escaping over the porous border with
Georgia. New evidence shows that rebels are taking refuge in
Georgia, while the Kremlin has undertaken a handful of incursions
into Georgian territory itself, threatening to turn what Moscow has
called a ``domestic conflict'' into a regional one. (Coker, Cox

&HT;     TRADE OPENED DOOR FOR POLITICAL REVOLUTION IN MEXICO

   SAN ANTONIO _ Supporters of the North American Free Trade
Agreement touted the pact as a boon to the Mexican, Canadian and
U.S. economies. But it may have had another, unintended
consequence: political reform in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Mexican voters elected as president Vincente Fox of
the National Action Party, the first president from outside the
governing Institutional Revolutionary Party in 71 years. Political
and economic analysts believe the steps that led to Fox's historic
election can be directly traced to NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government slowly began to realize they can grow the
economy much faster if they gain the confidence of foreign
investors,'' said Alejandro Velez, a professor of economics at St.
Mary's University. ``To do that, you have to open politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's election was a dramatic shift in Mexican politics. Many
institutions were firmly controlled by the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, known by its Spanish acronym, PRI. Previous
elections had signaled voter dissatisfaction with the PRI, but one
way or another _ fraud I soften alleged _ the PRI always managed to
win the top office.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1994, the implementation of NAFTA coincided with the
election of the PRI's Ernesto Zedillo and an economic crisis.
Zedillo, an internationally trained economist less beholden to PRI
bosses than his predecessors, began pushing for reforms within the
party and in Mexico's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, a NAFTA-induced economic boom began boosting people into
the middle class, and people began migrating from the countryside
to the cities to seek jobs. The cities became strongholds of power
for National Action, known as PAN. Meanwhile, political reforms
like this year's first-ever primary elections were being
introduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not having NAFTA probably would have condemned (Mexico) to
more years of darkness,'' Velez said. ``Instead, it has heralded a
new era in Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   By last week, with the Mexican economy growing quickly, trade
with neighboring nations to the north and no signs of a peso
devaluation that often accompanies presidential elections, the
electorate decided to dump the PRI and take a chance on Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of who won, either Fox or (PRI candidate Francisco)
Labastida, people knew that the economy would continue to expand,''
said Jorge Gonzalez, chairman of the economics department at
Trinity University in San Antonio. ``That gave them the freedom to
vote for whomever they wanted politically.''
</P>
<P>
   That freedom, Gonzalez maintains, emanates directly from NAFTA's
economic benefits. He said that is a lesson for those who criticize
open trade with countries like China or Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once people see the freedom we have in the world, there's no
way they'll stay with a system that won't allow them to speak their
mind about politics.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Trade advocates will likely cite the Mexican transition as an
example of how open markets can spawn open governments. But Rep.
Ciro Rodriguez, D-Texas, who supported NAFTA and trade with Cuba
but opposed normalized trade relations with China, says each
country must be considered separately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuba is not a national threat to us, and its proximity to us
has a bearing, like with Mexico,'' he said. ``It's also not a
nuclear threat to us, and it's not been stealing secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, countries like China are likely to draw lessons from how
quickly _ and orderly _ Mexico changed once NAFTA was implemented.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trade is not simply exporting tomatoes or jalapenos, it's also
about change in ways you produce things and involving investors
from abroad,'' Velez said. ``To do that, you have to have a
political system that's not going to collapse.''

<P>
   &UR; FEATURES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   HUDSON-SHAKESPEARE (Undated) _ In the theater it isn't always an
encouraging sign when the audience leaves humming the scenery. But
at the Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival, it's all but inevitable.
The festival, one of the best-kept theatrical secrets of summer in
the gentrified outer reaches of the New York metropolitan area, is
ensconced in the most lyrical of settings for open-air theater: the
grounds of the Boscobel Restoration, a historic house and gardens
on a promontory overlooking the Hudson River across from West
Point. The plays change each July and August, but the magnificent
backdrop is immutable. By Peter Marks.
</P>
<P>
   VANGOGH-PORTRAITS (Boston) _ Despite a reputation for antisocial
behavior (the episode of the amputated earlobe looms large),
Vincent van Gogh was a people person. He was an avid talker and
letter writer, fluent in four languages. Early in his short life he
held a series of face-the-public jobs, as an apprentice art dealer,
a schoolteacher and an evangelical preacher. Van Gogh is surrounded
by people, and very much part of the crowd, in ``Van Gogh: Face to
Face,'' a show devoted to his portraits, at the Museum of Fine Arts
here. Among the 80 entries are paintings and drawings of friends
and neighbors, lovers and strangers, and repeatedly, magnetically,
of the artist himself. By Holland Cotter.
</P>
<P>
   NY-AUTOMOBILE-ROW (New York) _ Given New York's hate-hate
relationship with motor vehicles _ on the one hand, their numbers
and bulk make the streets impassable; on the other hand, their
fumes and noise foul the atmosphere _ it is hard to imagine a day
when mid-Manhattan was the automotive Acropolis of America. But
there was such a time. And there was such a place: Automobile Row,
a one-and-a-half mile stretch of Broadway from the 40s to the 70s,
lined with car makers, tire companies and dealerships by the
dozens. Bedazzled buyers could find the ``Three P's'' of luxury
motoring _ Packard, Peerless and Pierce (makers of the Arrow) _
jostling for attention with Babcock Electrics and White Steamers,
Hupmobiles, Loziers, Overlands, Reos and Speedwells. By David W.
Dunlap.
</P>
<P>
   RUSCHA-RETROSPECTIVE (Washington) _ If you can catch the
traveling retrospective of Ed Ruscha's 40-year career, now here at
the Hirshhorn Museum, you should do so. Ruscha's scrutiny of the
world is truly American, and his art hovers tantalizingly on the
edge of slapstick, with enough intimation of melancholy to keep you
guessing. By Michael Kimmelman.
</P>
<P>
   RAUSCHENBERG-NEW-WORK (New York) _ Continuing his long-running

Robert Rauschenberg has unveiled his latest enterprise at the

AT 175 MPH, 911 TURBO CAUSES EARTH TO SHIFT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACK ROCK DESERT, Nev. _ We are strapped tightly into the 2001
Porsche 911 Turbo as it reaches 150 miles per hour and sizzles
across the cracked desert floor.
</P>
<P>
   Between the two of us we have five wins at the 24 Hours of
Daytona, three wins at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, two wins at the 12
Hours of Sebring, and four good wrecks at the Hopkinton, N.H.,
State Fair Demolition Derby.
</P>
<P>
   All the endurance wins belong to the great Hurley Haywood. The
demolition derby wrecks were mine.
</P>
<P>
   I am driving as we head to 175-plus miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   The surface over which we race is the hard, dried silt of a
playa (Spanish for intermittent lake). In 1997, a jet car broke the
sound barrier on this surface. But it is not stable. Cracked in the
sun, it resembles an unassembled jigsaw puzzle. Even light cars
leave shattered tracks. In some places, the pieces shift beneath
your feet.
</P>
<P>
   The effect can be disconcerting. In a test run parallel to the
main track on which we go for a top speed, the car had wiggled its
rear steadily as the surface shifted beneath it. Like driving in an
inch of snow.
</P>
<P>
   Haywood's advice? Let the car go where it will go. Use the wheel
ever so delicately. Half-inch turns in either direction are plenty.
But that is not your instinct when, at 125 miles per hour, the car
hints at slipping sideways. There is a danger of overcorrecting.
That would be a bad thing, especially at higher speeds. Delicate
steering takes some time to get used to when your head screams
``countersteer.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, I have had two days and more than 300 miles in this
marvelous new car, which is the fastest, most stable street machine
Porsche has ever built.
</P>
<P>
   It is an all-wheel-drive, road-eating beast powered by an
all-new Porsche engine based on the power plant from the Le
Mans-winning GT1 race car. With two intercooled turbochargers and
24 valves, the 3.6-liter engine packs a walloping 415 horsepower
and 413 lb.-ft. of torque.
</P>
<P>
   Most impressive is the peak torque band, which runs from 2,700
to 4,600 rpms. Even in sixth gear with the manual transmission, the
car picks up and goes like a rocket.
</P>
<P>
   It does 0-62 in 4.2 seconds. Top speed can be around 190 miles
per hour. Air dams with channeled flows, spoiler lips at the front
of the wheel arches, and a hydraulic rear wing (it pops up at 75
m.p.h.) provide down force to keep the Porsche hugging the road.
</P>
<P>
   And hug it it does, as those 300 miles proved.
</P>
<P>
   There are places in Nevada where undulating roads stretch as far
as you can see. A tempting place to let it rip. And it's clear that
this Porsche could go from top speed limit well into triple digits
in seconds.
</P>
<P>
   There are places in Nevada where roads climb up to 9,000 feet _
roads that twist and turn and switch back again and again.
Sometimes there are guardrails, sometimes there are not. In some
places, you round a corner and are looking out over an endless
valley 4,000 feet below. It's as if you're looking out the
windscreen of an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   One of these snakes runs up to Virginia City, the old mining
town. It is here they hold the Virginia City Hill Climb. A tempting
place to see how the Porsche corners at speed.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear the 911 Turbo could rip the brief straights in triple
digits, take the corners and hairpins and switchbacks at four times
the posted limit, and feel as if it's riding on rails.
</P>
<P>
   The faster these cars go, the more stable they become, one
Porsche executive said at the car's introduction in Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Back out on the Black Rock Desert Playa, stability was just what
I was looking for.
</P>
<P>
   The acceleration run was to be made along a 3-mile course.
Orange cones marked its edges. In the distance, mirages that looked
like silver clouds danced along the horizon. The curvature of the
earth was evident.
</P>
<P>
   The speed test 911 was the European model _ 20 millimeters lower
than the US model. Its Pirelli N3 tires had been X-rayed to check
for defects.
</P>
<P>
   For safety equipment, it had an elaborate roll cage, racing
seats, and five-point safety harness. It also came equipped with
Haywood.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was to speed up through the first mile, hit the second
and critical measured mile at high speed, put the gas pedal to the
floor and keep it there as the United States Auto Club recorded
average speed for the mile and top speed. The third mile would be
used to slow down. It was this last, frankly, that worried me more
than running the middle mile at speed. How do you stop smoothly on
this surface? Let's find out.
</P>
<P>
   We took off gradually, then worked our way up through the gears,
the familiar wiggle setting in at about 100 miles per hour _ the
last time I looked down at the speedometer.
</P>
<P>
   I looked only straight ahead and well down the race course. At
high speed, looking out the side or too close to the front of the
car can induce dizziness.
</P>
<P>
   The cones seemed to rise out of the desert floor straight ahead,
popping up for split seconds and disappearing. I don't know what
speed we were doing when we hit the measured mile, but everything
seemed to smooth out. Later I was told the surface was a bit
smoother there.
</P>
<P>
   I never saw the monitors at the beginning or end of the measured
portion. I was too busy looking far out and straight ahead. Haywood
did, though, and once we were through talked me into a graceful
slowdown _ backing off slowly on the gas, not touching the brake
until we'd dropped to 100, and then only touching it softly.
</P>
<P>
   I'd averaged 169.411 through the mile. Top speed was 175.438.
The Porsche could go faster, but Haywood said later that was plenty
fast on that surface.
</P>
<P>
   For my run, I got a plaque. Haywood got to survive. He's got
plenty of plaques and trophies.

<P>
   RENO _ There's great variety in driving a different car every
week. But there can also be a certain sameness _ same commute into
the city; one dirt road's another dirt road; tree-lined country
lanes blur even in their beauty.
</P>
<P>
   That's why it's good to get away and drive once in a while. It's
why taking the 2000 Porsche 911 Cabriolet on a run from here to San
Francisco and back _ and later playing on the mountains and deserts
that surround Reno _ was such a recent treat.
</P>
<P>
   This is the 911 descended from a long line that began in 1965.
Its latest incarnation was given to us for the 1999 model year and
has been tweaked just a bit for 2000. In the Porsche world right
now, the basic 911 does not have the buzz that surrounds other
models _ Boxster and Boxster S, the Carrera 4, and the hot new
all-wheel-drive 911 Turbo. But the 911 is, after all, the spine of
Porsche.
</P>
<P>
   So we drove it up and over the mountains, Reno to the City by
the Bay, up steep Interstate 80, down winding Interstate 80,
through the valley at Sacramento, and to the sea. Back in the
Reno-Tahoe area, we climbed on tortuous roads to 9,000 feet in a
curving ascent that would give angst to acrophobes. And we rolled
across remote stretches of desert (carefully obeying traffic laws
on Indian reservations where, we were told, even three miles an
hour over the speed limit meant a $500 fine, payable on the spot).
</P>
<P>
   It was easy spending hours at a time in this car, just enjoying
its power, its handling, its comfort.
</P>
<P>
   It surged along the highway, charged up the steepest stretches
the Nevada-California border could offer.
</P>
<P>
   On rolling desert highway, with visibility as far as the eye
could see, it was obvious you could run in the 911 Cabriolet for as
long as you wanted at speeds well into the triple digits.
</P>
<P>
   On those hairpinned and switchback climbs and descents on lesser
roads _ and we're talking no guardrails sometimes _ it cornered on
rails of its own. It's rear-wheel drive, and even without Porsche
Stability Management, it felt as though you'd have to try real hard
to shake the rear end loose or to induce terminal understeer.
</P>
<P>
   In short, superb, solid handling.
</P>
<P>
   The multi-layered suspension includes independent struts,
aluminum lower control arms, coil springs, stabilizer bar, and
gas-charged twin tube shocks up front and, in the rear, an
independent five-link setup with coil springs, single tube shocks,
and stabilizer bar.
</P>
<P>
   You get no body roll, no sense of the torsional twist you might
expect in a drop-top. You might be able to induce a touch of the
latter on a racetrack, but not many of us will be driving a
Cabriolet there.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of Porsche, the braking was superb: Set weight to the
front wheels to enter a fast corner and it took only the slightest
touch. Try to bring it down from high speed in a desert experiment
and it will track true to a belt-tightening stop.
</P>
<P>
   The ride was exceptionally quiet for a convertible, the seats
low and firm (Porsche-like again), though I'd question whether you
could fairly call this a 2x2 since any two adults in the rear would
be chewing on their knees. Of course, we could just pretend it's
still the '60s and that's just part of the adventure.
</P>
<P>
   If I had one complaint to make from the driver's seat it would
be that a big swath of canvas at the rear corners of the roof
blocks the view.
</P>
<P>
   For safety, it's got airbags all around and a roll bar that
automatically deploys once the car tilts to that certain scary
angle.
</P>
<P>
   In 911 fashion, the engine is a horizontally opposed
six-cylinder (hey, Subaru likes the idea so much you'll see one in
the new Outback). This helps keep the center of gravity low. It's a
3.4 liter that, because of an improved exhaust system, gives four
more horsepower (300) than the '99 model. You can have a six-speed
manual or the five-speed Tiptronic.
</P>
<P>
   The test model had the Tiptronic, with wheel-mounted controls.
Working the gears was a lot like playing a video game.
</P>
<P>
   Also helping boost performance for 2000 is an ``E-throttle.''
You may think you're stepping on the gas and causing direct action,
but as a Porsche guy explained to me, what you do with the pedal is
merely a suggestion to the car's control center, which then uses
cams, valves, and the air and fuel supply to do that job best for
you.
</P>
<P>
   I put about 800 miles on the Cabriolet, much of it at high
altitude and on steep grades, and got 19 miles per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   This is a superb car, but here would be my dilemma: I haven't
driven the Boxster S, yet I've heard great things about its
performance. Before I'd drop $80,000 on the 911, I'd want to know
one thing: Is it $30,000 better than the Boxster S?
</P>
<P>
   I'll get into the latter real soon.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touch:
</P>
<P>
   --The one-touch operation of the convertible top. Fifteen
seconds and it's tucked away under a big smooth crescent.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance:
</P>
<P>
   --They sell you a convertible for $80,000 _ and then want $250
for a rear wind deflector? I don't think so.

 &HT;    'Scary Movie' the new champ in bad-taste derby
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We can probably all agree that ``Scary Movie,'' the Wayans'
brothers' spoof of teen slasher films, is stupid and gross. The
problem is that a large segment of the movie-going public considers
those adjectives to be compliments, not put-downs.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a parody of these
someone-is-out-there-stalking-and-killing-teens movies is hardly a
new idea. Kevin Williamson already claimed that territory with his
substantially more clever ``Scream'' franchise. At least the first
two installments self-referentially noted the cliches of the genre,
kidded them, yet still made them work. Now comes ``Scary Movie,'' a
spoof of the spoof ``Scream ``(whose original title, as trivia fans
know, was ``Scary Movie''). Got it?
</P>
<P>
   Whole scenes here are lifted from ``Scream,'' then warped and
broadened into crude comedy by TV's Shawn and Marlon Wayans,
working with their older brother, director Keenan Ivory Wayans.
With a committee of gag writers, they also send up ``I Know What
You Did Last Summer,'' a mere ``Scream `` wannabe. Eventually,
after they exhaust all the jokes in these two movies, they cast
their nets wider and kid any recent hit, from ``The Blair Witch
Project'' to ``The Usual Suspects'' to ``The Matrix.''
</P>
<P>
   The tradition of these parody movies goes back at least as far
as the Zucker brothers, who demolished disaster movies _ a category
every bit as silly as slasher films _ with 1980's ``Airplane!''
Through the ``Naked Gun'' series and beyond, they wavered in
quality, but remained sufficiently amusing. Now come the Wayans
brothers in that Zucker mold, but grafted onto the brazenly bad
taste of the Farrelly Brothers (''There's Something About Mary'').
</P>
<P>
   It begins promisingly enough, spoofing ``Scream's'' opening.
Carmen Electra as the slyly named Drew Decker is home alone popping
popcorn, when she gets a terrifying phone call, followed by a visit
from a knife-wielding specter in a Halloween costume.
</P>
<P>
   She escapes his clutches, strips down to her undies for reasons
that are unclear (but who's arguing?), then runs through lawn
sprinklers for an even more alluring wet look, before being caught
and bludgeoned in the chest.
</P>
<P>
   When they learn of Drew's demise, her high school pals _ all way
beyond student age _ fret they will be next, fearing that the
killer knows they ran over a guy in the road last Halloween and
left him for dead. That is about as far as the plot goes, for
``Scary Movie'' gives up on story in favor of unconnected sketch
vignettes built around slasher movie archetypes.
</P>
<P>
   There's the virginal heroine, Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), who
is busy keeping her horny boyfriend at bay, the obnoxious
television reporter Gail Hailstrom (Cheri Oteri) busy cashing in on
the mayhem, and the slow-witted deputy sheriff Doofy (Dave
Sheridan), who is busy drooling.
</P>
<P>
   Off in their own world, a kind of ``In Living Color'' but
without the inhibitions of network television, are Shawn Wayans as
a gay football jock in deep denial over his orientation and Marlon
Wayans as a horror movie junkie obsessed with getting high. Their
acting style could best be described as indulgent.
</P>
<P>
   In the all-time bad-taste derby, ``Scary Movie'' takes the lead,
just weeks after ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene'' became the new crude champ.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, if stupid and gross is what you're after, the Wayans
clan is gleefully eager to accommodate. Warning: If ``Scary Movie''
turns into a hit, it will encourage someone to make a film even
more stupid and gross. That would be a truly scary prospect.
</P>
<P>
   SCARY MOVIE
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 stars.
</P>
<P>
   Rated R: Prosthetic private parts, comic violence, crude sexual
situations, language
</P>
<P>
   Running time: 1 hour, 28 minutes
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Broad, obvious parody of teen slasher movies and
other genres.

 &HT;    Man-child reunion too dull for kids, too artless for adults
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's an interesting Freudian premise in the new Bruce Willis
movie, the name-branded ``Disney's The Kid'':
</P>
<P>
   What if, by a primal fluke of nature, you met yourself as an
8-year-old child? What if the tot reminded you of everything you
disliked about your youth, while your adult achievements greatly
disappointed your younger self?
</P>
<P>
   The ramifications are enough to keep a swarm of psychotherapists
busy for years. But remember whose Kid this is, so wipe away any
thoughts of analytic depth and replace them with gooey Baby Boomer
feel-good vibes. Never fret that you may not know what to think
about image consultant Russ Duritz's personal quandary, for Marc
Shaiman's treacly, sitcom-music score tells you how to react at
every moment.
</P>
<P>
   Although it may not be obvious to a youngster, Russ has a great
job. He gets to insult politicians, television news anchors and
baseball team owners in the guise of helping them, and then he
bills them for his public relations advice. But in the eyes of
pudgy 8-year-old Rusty (certifiably adorable Spencer Breslin, a
veteran of commercials), Russ is a loser _ with a capital ``L'' _
because he is not married, doesn't pilot jets and he doesn't own a
dog. Sure, we could add that he also makes movies like ``Hudson
Hawk,'' but why rub it in?
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter that Russ wears $2,000 suits, has an
extraordinary bachelor pad and plenty of other adult toys
signifying material success. Yet it doesn't bring happiness,
because _ as Dr. Freud might put it if he worked for Disney _ he
has lost touch with his inner child. Oh, and he's a rotten person.
</P>
<P>
   He ignores his aging father, is brusque with his tirelessly
efficient assistant (a droll Lily Tomlin, who must not realize she
has mistakenly gotten involved in kids' stuff) and is downright
insensitive to his British sidekick (a waifish Emily Mortimer, who
looks disconcertingly like Demi Moore at times).
</P>
<P>
   Although the screenplay by Audrey Wells (''Guinevere'') is said
to be an original, someone should check her library records to see
how recently she checked out Charles Dickens' ``A Christmas
Carol.'' You know the book: well-heeled curmudgeon is visited by an
apparition from his past, is guided through telling moments from
his life, learns the importance of stopping and smelling the roses
and makes an astonishing conversion to generous lovability by the
fade-out. Far be it from me to give away the ending, but do not be
surprised to see Willis clutching a puppy before the final credits
roll.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine that an A-list star yearned to be in a
sentimental, family-friendly comedy, but then things did work out
well for him the last time he teamed up with a small boy.
Personally, I have a sixth sense that ``Disney's The Kid'' will not
fare as well with audiences, mainly because it cannot decide whom
it is aimed at. Youngsters are bound to be bored at Russ'
midlife-crisis angst, and adults should find Jon Turteltaub's
rose-colored, forced comic tone too simplistic to be taken
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there are lots of precious child actors hanging out on Los
Angeles street corners, but young Breslin more than meets the
movie's requirements. He has a handful of hang-dog expressions,
talks like he has a mouthful of spit and delivers lines with deadly
comic timing. Like Haley Joel Osment before him, Breslin steals all
of his scenes with Willis, which, in this case, is hardly grand
larceny.
</P>
<P>
   Mortimer also comes off well, even if her chief assignment is to
look longingly and admiringly at Willis, only to be crushed each
time he acts heartlessly. Jean Smart has a couple of nice scenes as
the newscaster in need of a makeover, but her presence only cements
the movie's sitcom feel.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Disney's The Kid'' catches on with audiences, it will be
because it stands out in this summer's sea of testosterone and
tastelessness. In fact, it is one more lame Disney live-action
comedy.
</P>
<P>
   DISNEY'S THE KID
</P>
<P>
   Two stars
</P>
<P>
   Rated PG: Mildly rude behavior
</P>
<P>
   Running time: 1 hour, 44 minutes
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Willis meets his 8-year-old self in a midlife-angst
comedy not quite suited for either kids or adults.

SOUTH AFRICA LOSES TO GERMANY AS SITE FOR SOCCER'S 2006 WORLD CUP
 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By DANIEL J. WAKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Soccer's international body Thursday awarded the 2006 World Cup
finals to Germany over South Africa in a close vote that dashed
hopes that the world's most popular sporting event would be held
for the first time in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-11 vote by the executive committee of the body, known as
FIFA, came as a shock to South Africans and to many in the soccer
world. In recent weeks, vote-bargaining had appeared to make South
Africa the favorite. The nation had a boost from the beginning when
the president of the soccer body, Sepp Blatter, first expressed the
desire for Africa to be named as the location for the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The World Cup finals draw billions of television viewers and
billions of dollars in revenue when they are staged every four
years, most recently in France in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Blatter had argued that the World Cup should rotate from
continent to continent. The 2002 World Cup competition will be held
in Asia, with South Korea and Japan as co-hosts. Four World Cup
finals have been held in South America _ in Uruguay, Brazil, Chile
and Argentina _ and three in North America _ two in Mexico and one
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The 2006 World Cup finals will be Europe's 10th, and Germany's
second. The last one there was in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   For South Africa, the chance to become the site of the finals
was more than just a question of wealth. The country's bid
organizers argued that the West had a moral obligation toward a
nation emerging from decades of apartheid, where soccer is the
passion of the long-oppressed black majority and where sports have
been seen in the post-apartheid era as an engine of racial healing
and a symbol of the once-isolated country's return to the
international fold. They also argued that soccer is the continent's
sports passion, and that Africa has fueled European clubs with
players for years now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course the disappointment we're experiencing today is a
setback to our efforts at gaining the recognition that Africa
deserves in the international sporting community,'' President Thabo
Mbeki said in a live broadcast on South African television.
</P>
<P>
   Germany was awarded the World Cup games on the third round of
voting.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the first round, Germany received 10 votes; six went to South
Africa and five went to England. Morocco received three first-round
votes and was eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   In the next round, Germany and South Africa tied at 11 votes
each, and England _ which suffered an image problem because of
recent incidents of soccer hooliganism _ was cut, with only two
votes.
</P>
<P>
   In the third round, one of the two people who cast votes for
England, Scotland's David Will, threw his lot to Germany. Charles
Dempsey, the New Zealand delegate, abstained. If he had voted for
South Africa, creating a 12-12 tie, Blatter would have cast the
deciding vote, presumably for his longtime favorite, South Africa,
The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey's abstention stunned the South Africans.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the German bid group, Franz Beckenbauer, said he
was surprised by the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not prepared for this because you can't be prepared for
this,'' he said. ``It was a very close result. We'd hoped for this
but we couldn't expect it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The South Africans argued that they had the infrastructure to
stage a successful World Cup final. One of the obstacles that South
Africa had to overcome was worries about its severe crime problem.
The nation has one of the highest crime rates in the world, and
visiting sportsmen have fallen victim in the past. Stadium security
is also not the strictest, given that the apartheid-era security
forces gave it scant attention.
</P>
<P>
   Other marks against South Africa were a poor public
transportation system and the country's distance for European fans.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa had promised to devote 10 percent of its budget to
security, and it pointed to previous international events it had
hosted _ the 1995 rugby World Cup, the 1996 Africa Cup of Nations
soccer tournament, the 1998 track and field World Cup and the 1999
Africa Games.

&HT;     CEREAL MAKER TO PROMOTE VOLUNTEER PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ It may not have any snap, crackle or pop, but the
makers of an organic breakfast cereal are delivering a passionate
pitch to millions of young adults in an effort to recruit them into
the AmeriCorps volunteer organization.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to dramatically increase the organization's ranks to meet
membership goals during the next few years, General Mills has
teamed up with the government to call attention to the 5-year-old
volunteer corps.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning this month, the company's top-selling organic
breakfast cereal, Sunrise Organic, will feature three AmeriCorps
members on its boxes, and the company has pledged to donate $1 to
AmeriCorps programs for every cereal box sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to be as recognizable as the Peace Corps,'' said
Harris Wofford, a former Democratic senator from Pennsylvania and
current chief executive officer of the Corporation for National
Service, which oversees AmeriCorps.
</P>
<P>
   ``This program with Sunrise Organic breakfast cereal reaches
more people than we've ever been able to reach in the past. You
could say we were looking for something to give our recruiting more
bite,'' Wofford said.
</P>
<P>
   AmeriCorps is a government-sponsored volunteer organization
whose members work in a variety of service projects across the
country. Members receive a stipend to cover living expenses and
health insurance and, after a year of service, an education award
to pay for college or pay back student loans.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its recruiting campaign, the cereal company will
feature three AmeriCorps volunteers on the back panel of the box. A
brief text describes their current service projects, which include
organic farming and national park restoration. The box also offers
a Web link where monthly updates and photographs of each of the
volunteers will be provided.
</P>
<P>
   One of the volunteers, Juliet Schraeder, 24, of Madison, Wis.,
teaches organic gardening at the Austin Community Gardens in the
Texas state capital.
</P>
<P>
   The gardens grow vegetables for food banks and homeless
shelters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize how fulfilling this experience would be, but
working for AmeriCorps has turned out to be one of the greatest
experiences of my life,'' Schraeder said.
</P>
<P>
   AmeriCorps is hoping to recruit 50,000 volunteers this year. Its
current membership is 40,000. Clinton has proposed that the
organization enlist 100,000 new volunteers each year by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   More than 150,000 mostly young people have served in AmeriCorps
since it was launched in 1994. Besides park preservation and
organic farming, AmeriCorps volunteers coordinate disaster relief,
fight forest fires, build homes and tutor, mentor and help
vaccinate children.

   HUDSON-SHAKESPEARE (Undated) _ In the theater it isn't always an
encouraging sign when the audience leaves humming the scenery. But
at the Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival, it's all but inevitable.
The festival, one of the best-kept theatrical secrets of summer in
the gentrified outer reaches of the New York metropolitan area, is
ensconced in the most lyrical of settings for open-air theater: the
grounds of the Boscobel Restoration, a historic house and gardens
on a promontory overlooking the Hudson River across from West
Point. The plays change each July and August, but the magnificent
backdrop is immutable. By Peter Marks.
</P>
<P>
   VANGOGH-PORTRAITS (Boston) _ Despite a reputation for antisocial
behavior (the episode of the amputated earlobe looms large),
Vincent van Gogh was a people person. He was an avid talker and
letter writer, fluent in four languages. Early in his short life he
held a series of face-the-public jobs, as an apprentice art dealer,
a schoolteacher and an evangelical preacher. Van Gogh is surrounded
by people, and very much part of the crowd, in ``Van Gogh: Face to
Face,'' a show devoted to his portraits, at the Museum of Fine Arts
here. Among the 80 entries are paintings and drawings of friends
and neighbors, lovers and strangers, and repeatedly, magnetically,
of the artist himself. By Holland Cotter.

<P>
   NY-AUTOMOBILE-ROW (New York) _ Given New York's hate-hate
relationship with motor vehicles _ on the one hand, their numbers
and bulk make the streets impassable; on the other hand, their
fumes and noise foul the atmosphere _ it is hard to imagine a day
when mid-Manhattan was the automotive Acropolis of America. But
there was such a time. And there was such a place: Automobile Row,
a one-and-a-half mile stretch of Broadway from the 40s to the 70s,
lined with car makers, tire companies and dealerships by the
dozens. Bedazzled buyers could find the ``Three P's'' of luxury
motoring _ Packard, Peerless and Pierce (makers of the Arrow) _
jostling for attention with Babcock Electrics and White Steamers,
Hupmobiles, Loziers, Overlands, Reos and Speedwells. By David W.
Dunlap.

   RUSCHA-RETROSPECTIVE (Washington) _ If you can catch the

world is truly American, and his art hovers tantalizingly on the
edge of slapstick, with enough intimation of melancholy to keep you
guessing. By Michael Kimmelman.

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of scenes from the
television miniseries ``Nuremberg.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Modern-day Hollywood has a strict hierarchy: Those who make
feature movies, however trite, are the elite, while network
television people are considered lesser artists. As for those who
toil for cable television, well, they are so low on the totem pole
that the others often won't even acknowledge their existence.
 &HT;    It's an attitude which makes no sense at all, and no greater
proof is needed than ``Nuremberg,'' the two-part miniseries airing
on Turner Network Television July 16 and 17.
 &HT;    ``You're never, never, never in a thousand light years, in the
current universe, going to get the networks to make the Nuremberg
trials for television,'' says star Alec Baldwin, a veteran of
feature films. ``I've pitched relevant, historical dramas like
this, and the networks just completely glaze over.''
 &HT;    Their loss, then. This account of the 1945 Nuremberg trials, in
which 21 Nazi leaders were tried on war-crimes charges, is a
remarkable achievement. It stars Baldwin as Chief Justice Robert
Jackson, the lead prosecutor, with Brian Cox as the Nazi Field
Marshal Hermann Goering, Christopher Plummer as the British
prosecutor Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe and Jill Hennessy _ best known
for ``Law and Order'' _ as Jackson's assistant, Elsie Douglas.
 &HT;    This capable cast, plus an absorbing script by David W. Rintels,
add up to some of the most compelling hours of film seen in a very
long time, on the big screen or elsewhere.
 &HT;    It's 1945 and the victorious Allies _ the United States,
Britain, France and Russia _ are struggling to deal with the
mounting evidence that the atrocities committed by Hitler's Third
Reich are the most heinous in the history of the civilized world.
It's difficult to put an entire nation on trial, so the four
occupying powers decide to charge 22 members of the Nazi high
command with war crimes and ``crimes against humanity'' _ the first
time that term has ever been used.
 &HT;    One of the accused, German Labor Front boss Robert Ley, hangs
himself before the trial, leaving 21 men to face an international
team of prosecutors at Nuremberg _ an ironic venue, since it was
from Nuremberg that Hitler's mammoth Nazi Party rallies broadcast
the ``glory'' of his Reich to the world.
 &HT;    Hollywood has told this story before, in Stanley Kramer's
``Judgement at Nuremberg'' (1961), with an all-star cast that
included Spencer Tracy, Burt Lancaster, Marlene Dietrich and Judy
Garland. Though sober and well-intentioned, it was a
once-over-lightly look at the trial as melodrama, without too much
concern for historical accuracy.
 &HT;    This version, on the other hand, takes accuracy very seriously.
Based on Joseph E. Persico's book ``Nuremberg: Infamy on Trial''
(Viking Press, 1994) and made by a French-Canadian company in
Montreal, it goes for the historical truth, which turns out to have
plenty of drama for even the most restless viewer.
 &HT;    ``The overwhelming majority of what is said in the film is
excerpted from the actual trial transcripts,'' Baldwin says, ``but
in the case of Jackson's opening argument, the actual document was
somewhere between 40 and 60 pages in length, which would have been
a miniseries in itself. So we had to abbreviate.
 &HT;    ``We also had to telescope the number of principal roles for
dramatic purposes,'' he adds, ``so we wound up bringing four or
five people to the fore, so that we could attract good actors who
wanted to play those roles.''
 &HT;    The story focuses primarily on the battle between good and evil,
as personified by Brian Cox's Goering, who is the rallying point
and cheerleader for the imprisoned Nazis, and Baldwin's Jackson,
terrified of not having the legal skills to make history.
 &HT;    But the villains are anything but cardboard bad guys. Goering in
particular is shown in many dimensions, and the heroes understand
that, had the war gone differently, they themselves might have
ended up on trial for war crimes.
 &HT;    Even the back stories are fascinating. They include the
political maneuvering between the French, American, British and
Russian judges, the posturings of a vain American justice (Len
Cariou) with a chip on his shoulder and the paternal relationship
between the suave British prosecutor (Plummer) and his
less-seasoned American colleague _ for once, it is the American who
is the most cautious of the group.
 &HT;    There's also the relationship between Goering and the
Jewish-American military shrink assigned to psychoanalyze the
defendants, as well as a fascinating, crucial piece of theater as
Goering uses his Machiavellian powers to woo the young American
lieutenant sent to guard him.
 &HT;    These later scenes are in some ways the most chilling of all,
because they show the seductive power of the Nazi mentality, even
to people who know to what horrors that mentality can lead.
 &HT;    In the courtroom _ an exact replica of the room where the trials
took place _ actual concentration-camp films are shown as part of
the prosecution's case. They are hideous enough viewing today, and
one can only imagine what they must have been like for those
assembled in Nuremberg 55 years ago, viewing the evidence for the
first time.
 &HT;    ``Everyone was crying _ the extras who were on camera and even
one man who wasn't,'' Hennessy says. ``He was sitting beside me,
and I could hear him sobbing. At least I was allowed to cry _ the
actors portraying the Nazis could not permit themselves to do
that.''
 &HT;    Just as affecting, however, is a scene in which Plummer reads
the testimony of an ordinary German witness to a horrendous mass
murder. It was that scene, the veteran actor says, that persuaded
him to take the part.
 &HT;    Some of the highest drama took place offscreen. The parents of
actor Sam Stone _ who portrays Julius Streicher, Hitler's
hate-literature publisher _ survived a death camp near the
Russian/Romanian border. The actor had difficulty getting through
the showing of the real-life camp footage.
 &HT;    ``I was on the witness stand at the time and I was weeping,''
Stone says. ``One of the actors came over and put his hand round me
to comfort me. He was very kind. As it turned out, as a teen-ager
he had been in the Hitler Youth Movement.''
 &HT;    Everyone in the cast was mindful of their enormous
responsibility in bringing this story to a new generation who may
not have heard it.
 &HT;    ``The Nazis on trial at Nuremberg were like the New York Yankees
of bad guys,'' Baldwin says, ``and the legal team set out to have
the first war-crimes tribunal in history. Many legal scholars found
overwhelming flaws in the way the cases were handled, but, as much
as they were criticized, in the end the Nuremberg trials were an
incredibly important contribution to civilization.
 &HT;    ``What they did there was profound.''

KEVIN BACON FLESHES OUT A `HOLLOW MAN'

 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of Kevin Bacon
with Elisabeth Shue in a scene from ``The Hollow Man.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Kevin Bacon disappears into his roles, but he's hardly an
invisible actor.
 &HT;    Though he jokes that it may be his downfall, Bacon likes to err
on the side of acting big, of pushing a performance a tad too far.
Anyone who saw last year's ``Stir of Echoes,'' or the earlier ``The
River Wild'' or ``A Few Good Men,'' can attest to Bacon's sizzle.
 &HT;    ``I think, oftentimes, film actors were just told to `Dial it
down, dial it down, dial it down,''' Bacon says. ``I'll look at a
performance and think, `Wake the f--k up! Do a little acting. Do
something!'
 &HT;    ``I want to see some semblance of a performance if I'm paying my
money to see something,'' Bacon says. ``I tend to appreciate actors
who go over the top, (even if) they don't always hit.
 &HT;    ``Nic Cage is a good example,'' he says. ``James Woods, Dustin
Hoffman. It doesn't always work, but at least they are going for
it.''
 &HT;    Bacon goes for it again with his latest film, ``Hollow Man,'' a
variation on the ``Invisible Man'' saga directed by Paul Verhoeven.
Verhoeven previously helmed such high-adrenaline genre epics as
``Total Recall'' and ``Starship Troopers.''
 &HT;    ``Hollow Man'' will materialize on August 4, starring Bacon as
Sebastian Caine, a cocky scientist working with colleagues Linda
McKay (Elisabeth Shue) and Matthew Kensington (Josh Brolin) on
clandestine government research into invisibility. After
successfully testing a vanishing serum on animals, Caine ignores
protocol and injects himself with the serum.
 &HT;    ``The catch is that I am predisposed to a touch of evil,'' Bacon
says over lunch in a conference room at his publicist's Manhattan
office. ``That gets amplified, to say the least, when I become
invisible.
 &HT;    ``I start causing trouble, and I make life hell for Elisabeth
and Josh,'' he says. ``It's very bizarre and very cool. For
instance, a sprinkler system will come on and the water will cling
to my form. The movie is going to be good.''
 &HT;    Bacon spends a great deal of time offscreen, and thus had to
make his presence felt early and powerfully. All the thrills and
chills that follow Caine's invisibility are the combined result of
Bacon's voice, more than 500 special effects, the performances of
Shue and Brolin, and of course the virtuosity of director
Verhoeven.
 &HT;    As a filmmaker, Verhoeven is known as much for his hard-driving
directorial style as for the brutal violence and stark sexuality
depicted in his films. Bacon acknowledges that Verhoeven was not
one to fade into the woodwork.
 &HT;    ``Paul is very, very passionate,'' Bacon says, a wicked grin
crossing his face. ``He's kind of like a mad scientist himself _
he's got a brilliant mind and is just full of this incredible
energy. He gets very amped.
 &HT;    ``We got along really well,'' the actor adds. ``He can be
explosive and I'm not, but it seemed to work OK.''
 &HT;    Bacon's career might best be described as OK, too. Though he's
not a pack-'em-in megastar like Tom Cruise or Jim Carrey, the
42-year-old actor is in constant demand for both mainstream and
independent features. His genre pictures alone prove the point, as
they include ``Flatliners,'' ``Tremors'' and ``Apollo 13.''
 &HT;    Still, Bacon is not satisfied.
 &HT;    ``Never,'' says the actor, who lives with his wife, actress Kyra
Sedgwick, and their children in Connecticut, and will next be on
view opposite Helena Bonham Carter, Laura Dern and Steve Martin in
the dental comedy ``Novocaine.''
 &HT;    ``I don't know where I want to be,'' he says thoughtfully. ``I
feel that with `Stir of Echoes,' `Skip the Dog' and `Hollow Man,' I
am at a point again where things could be really good. `Hollow Man'
is a great part, a big part in a big film. It's a role where I get
to be a little evil, and those tend to be noticed by people.
 &HT;    ``If this period leads to anything for me, I'd love to get to do
a character that also happens to be the hero,'' Bacon adds. ``So
often in movies, especially the ones that get seen, the really
interesting roles are the bad guy, the goofy best friend and the
gay next-door neighbor. The hero usually isn't that much of a
character.
 &HT;    ``I want to play an interesting hero.''

THERE'S NOT MUCH ABOUT `SCARY'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You don't have to be a splatter-flick buff to know that ``Scary
Movie'' was the original title of ``Scream,'' Wes Craven's smart,
suspenseful spoof of slice-and-dice films. Now, there was a movie
that managed to slash its cake and eat it, too, reviving an
all-but-dead genre while mocking its conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Because ``Scream'' _ not to mention ``Scream 2'' and ``Scream
3'' _ was used instead of the original title, the door was left
open for Keenen Ivory Wayans to call his spoof ``Scary Movie,''
which lampoons ``Scream'' and its countless ripoffs. In other
words, it's a parody of a parody, and despite some chuckle-worthy
moments, ``Scary Movie'' is just as redundant as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   It starts well enough, with a sharp takeoff on ``Scream's''
bravura prologue, this time featuring Carmen Electra as the young
woman whose plans for a quiet night alone are interrupted by a
series of increasingly terrifying phone calls. Wayans and his
battery of writers come up with clever gags about Electra's
``Baywatch'' past and her one-time association with Prince, but
somehow miss out on a joke about her on-and-off marriage to Dennis
Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   But the prologue includes an unnecessary _ although perhaps
inevitable _ flatulence joke, and that's an indication of things to
come: For every clever little riff the writers concoct, there's a
huge gross-out moment that would make the Farrelly brothers blush.
This is the type of movie where when the filmmakers say, ``Let's
just throw things at the wall and see what sticks,'' they mean it
literally.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the antics surround poor Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris),
the archetypal virgin-who's-stalked-by-the-killer. Among Cindy's
buds are her increasingly libidinous boyfriend (Jon Abrahams), a
jock who shows every indication of not realizing that he's gay
(Shawn Wayans), and the school vixen (''American Pie's'' Shannon
Elizabeth, scoring the movie's one comic bull's-eye in an
evisceration of Rose McGowan's vampish screen persona). They and
the others in their crew (Lochlyn Munro and Regina Hall) evidently
kill a pedestrian, and begin receiving threatening notes, a la ``I
Know What You Did Last Summer,'' the title of which is continually
ridiculed. No one's ever done that before, huh?
</P>
<P>
   And therein is ``Scary Movie's'' other principal problem _ it
comes at least three years too late, when the slasher genre is
wheezing again and its internal parodies are once more
unintentional. Hence, many of ``Scary Movie's'' best riffs are on
non-slasher movies such as ``The Matrix,'' ``The Blair Witch
Project'' and ``The Sixth Sense.'' It does manage the occasional
savvy jab at the ``Scream'' series, including a funny twist on the
ol' the-killer-is-in-the-house bit and a gag about noisy audience
members that will have every polite movie fan silently cheering.
Marlon Wayans, as a gleeful pothead who parties with the killer,
also earns some laughs.
</P>
<P>
   If you've seen the trailer for ``Scary Movie,'' you'll note that
much of what's mentioned in the previous paragraph is included in
the preview. That's good marketing, but it's not necessarily good
moviemaking. What you won't see in the preview are the scenes that
put various bodily organs, functions and fluids on display.
Director Wayans relies too heavily on these grossout gags, which
inspire groans of disgust rather than howls of laughter. The truly
frightening thing about this is that, given our increased tolerance
for lowbrow humor during the past couple of years, the grossest
stuff is likely to make ``Scary Movie'' a hit. Even more
frightening is that it could merit a sequel.

 &HT;    AN AGING AMERICA FACES BROAD CHANGES, STUDY PREDICTS
 &HT;    580&AMP;add. With POPULATION-DATA-1STLD.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ America's aging population will force policy makers
to change everything from retirement benefits to the lettering on
traffic signs, presenting one of the key challenges in the 21st
century, a study predicted Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As the country's population grows, the proportion of old people
to young is growing, in large part because of better health care
that helps people live longer and the trend toward families with
fewer children.
</P>
<P>
   The median age of the population was 35.5 years in 1999,
compared to 22.9 in 1900. By 2100, the median age is projected by
the Census Bureau to be 40.3.
</P>
<P>
   ``This realignment has the potential of being more politically
challenging than anything we've seen before,'' said Martha
Farnsworth Riche, a population researcher and former Census Bureau
director who authored the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``It scares politicians because it is such a big political
task,'' she said at a news conference presenting the study,
``America's Diversity and Growth: Signposts for the 21st Century.''
</P>
<P>
   To visualize the problem, imagine a pyramid, with a wide base
representing children and gradually diminishing by age group to the
point at the top. That was the profile of the country's population
in 1900.
</P>
<P>
   By 2020, as the crest of post-World War II baby boomers reaches
retirement age, the model looks more like a pillar, with an almost
equal number of people in each age group from birth through age 70.
</P>
<P>
   Riche said the emerging population profile already has begun to
shape policy changes, from larger and easier-to-read lettering on
highway signs to the ongoing debate about Social Security and
retirement benefits. Housing traditionally designed for families
raising children will be revamped to accommodate people who want to
live in their own homes until very late in life, the study
suggests.
</P>
<P>
   The aging population will place new demands on the health care
system, and may stir political tensions between the generations as
younger people are taxed to finance the benefits of their elders.
</P>
<P>
   It also will influence the traditional notion of retirement,
with people continuing to work well beyond the age of 65. It will
open more opportunities for women who, because they are living
longer, have more time to begin or revive a career after their
childbearing and child-raising years, Riche said.
</P>
<P>
   The study notes that when the age threshold of 65 was set for
full Social Security benefits when the system was created in 1935,
average life expectancy at birth was about 62. Today it is 77, but
the age for full benefits is rising only to 67.
</P>
<P>
   Better health care and public-safety laws have Americans living
longer, what Riche called ``the success story of the 20th
century.'' Half of America's current population would not be alive
today had the advances not been made, the study shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the large growth of the older population, Americans will
no doubt revise their assumptions about what 'old' means for
individuals and institutions,'' the report concludes. ``Assumptions
that people will spend their entire work life in one occupation, or
that career ladders can be climbed in only one direction, may prove
ill-suited to a potentially longer work life.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was based on Census Bureau data and published by the
non-profit Population Reference Bureau, a Washington-based research
group.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In general, this century will be marked by robust population
growth and immigration, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration will continue to make America more diverse, the
study said. In 1999, 72 percent of Americans were white, with
blacks and Hispanics each making up 12 percent of the population
and Asian-Americans 4 percent. By 2050, the white population e
best. That's not stopping, and it shows no sign of stopping,''
Riche said.

MAKING THE LEAP TO DIGITAL PLANNING
</HEADLINE>
  By LONNIE BROWN   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years and years and years, Larry Becker ran his life with a
paper-based planner. Perhaps more correctly, a paper-based planner
ran Larry Becker's life. In fact, he used to teach courses in how
to effectively use the popular paper planners.
</P>
<P>
   You know the kind: Available in office-supply stores and by mail
order, their pages hold notations for meetings, to-do lists, phone
numbers, follow-ups and other personal and business items.
</P>
<P>
   Becker, who runs a Web marketing company in Lakeland, Fla., and
gives time-management seminars, never went anywhere without his
planner.
</P>
<P>
   Then about four years ago, the paper scales fell from his eyes,
and he saw the digital world of handheld personal information
managers. He never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   And that brings us to Becker's recent endeavor: A two-hour video
tape, ``Time Management in the Palm of Your Hand.'' The tape, as
the name implies, is centered around the Palm personal information
manager, but the system can be used with other digital planners.
(Since Handspring's Visor uses the Palm operating system _ and was
designed by the same people who brought out the original Palm _ it
works seemlessly with that planner.)
</P>
<P>
   Briefly, personal digital assistants (PDAs) are small devices _
about the size of a deck of cards so they fit easily in pocket or
purse _ that store and retrieve to-do lists, a daily calendar with
alarms, memos, addresses and telephone numbers. They can store
several years of activities, thousands of names and hundreds of
memos.
</P>
<P>
   Using a search feature, users can instantly locate anything
anywhere in the device.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the beauty of it,'' said Becker, 37. ``If you've ever
written something in a paper planner and then try to find it again,
you know it's not very efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Some planners are divided so that users carry one month with
them at a time. ``If you're out somewhere and need to refer to
something from a previous month, you're in trouble,'' said Becker.
Finding such information using a digital device is quick and
painless.
</P>
<P>
   Becker came up with the idea for a training film for Palm users
after he gave a seminar to employees whose company had purchased
Palm for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found they didn't even know the basics for using the Palm,''
said Becker. ``Some of them were using the keyboard (a screen
display of a keyboard that is used for entering text by tapping on
letters) instead of the Palm's handwriting recognition because they
didn't understand how to use it.'' Using a stylus, letters drawn on
the Palm's glass screen turn into typed text. With a little
practice, it's a fast way to enter text.
</P>
<P>
   The $49.95 tape is professionally done. Becker has used shots of
the Palm's screen extensively, so users can see what's going on as
information is being entered. That approach has also kept the
``talking head'' format to a minimum. A time sheet has been
included with the tape so viewers can quickly move to one of the
six sections covered for review.
</P>
<P>
   The first section gives users some of the basics of operating
the Palm. (''You'd be surprised the things people miss because they
don't read the manual,'' said Becker as a way of explaining why
seemingly basic information is included in the first few minutes.)
The second section deals in setting up the Palm for time
management. Becker recommends users create various to-do lists so
items can be classified in groups: today, tomorrow, soon, later,
morning, weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The third and fourth sections cover commitments to
time-management success and how to keep on target by using the
to-do list.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth section explains techniques for improving efficiency
with the Palm's calendar and appointment manager. The sixth section
takes users through a typical day in a busy life by demonstrating
how time management can be adjusted to handle unscheduled events
and keep track of ongoing projects.
</P>
<P>
   Becker recommends two programs to add to the Palm. While not
necessary to time-management techniques, they do add some
improvements to the Palm's date book and to-do list. Links for both
programs are available on Becker's Web site, www.palmplanning.com,
under the software section.
</P>
<P>
   The first, and least expensive, is BIG To Do. Palm's to-do list
has five levels of priority for items. BIG To Do allows items to be
ranked one through 10 in importance.
</P>
<P>
   Becker had a friend write the program, to make it easier to make
the transition from paper planner to the Palm. With only five
levels, there wasn't an easy way to fit in with the A-B-C-1-2-3
priority system used in paper planning, said Becker.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a big change, but it saves having a group of ones or
twos on a list. The program has a 30-day trial period. To continue
using it costs $4.95 to register.
</P>
<P>
   The second program is DATEBK3 ($20 from Pimlico Software). It's
very much like the Palm's date book program, but provides some
welcomed additions. One of those is a ``floating'' item: With
Palm's date book, an item that you didn't want to forget to do on a
Tuesday _ but didn't get done on that day _ would not automatically
move to Wednesday. The item had to be moved manually. DATEBK3 will
keep moving the item forward until it has been checked as done.
</P>
<P>
   Another nice feature: DATEBK3 displays high-priority items in
the to-do list on the daily appointments screen. That way, you're
reminded of items that need to be done as the day progresses.
</P>
<P>
   Users of Handspring's Visor don't need DATEBK3 because it's the
one the company used for its date book program. And although there
is a DATEBK4 version, Becker notes that it takes up nearly a half a
megabyte of Palm memory _ a lot more than DATEBK3 _ while not
adding substantial time-management functions. ``If memory is a
factor, DATEBK3 is the best one to use,'' said Becker.
</P>
<P>
   Becker has a book coming out in October, ``Teach Yourself Palm
Today,'' which will be published by the Sams division of Macmillan
USA.

FINDING A COMFORT ZONE WITH CHILDREN'S TV VIEWING
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A longtime reader, first-time caller is on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got a question,'' she starts. ``Um, er, hmmm ... don't know
how to ask this without sounding really, really stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Just ask. I'll be gentle.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK ... what's a v-chip?''
</P>
<P>
   A v-chip?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah. The television device thingie that keeps certain
programs from coming on. I saw a news program the other day, which
talked about parents not using it. How do I know I have one?''
</P>
<P>
   If you had one, you'd know it.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's not something the government or whomever just puts in
your house without you knowing it?''
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it sold door to door?''
</P>
<P>
   If someone tries, slam the door, lock it, and call 911.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, you get it, how?''
</P>
<P>
   Televisions come equipped with the device. If you haven't bought
a new set recently then you don't have a v-chip, or any other
device, designed to keep your kids from watching stuff you don't
want them to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, if that's the case, why are we being scolded for not using
it if we don't have it?''
</P>
<P>
   You're being scolded?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, not personally, but they're saying something about a lot
of parents whining about adult TV but this study they've done shows
that many parents aren't using the v-chip thingie that would give
them control over what their children watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Two out of five.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two out of five?''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah. Two out of five parents, according to researchers, aren't
bothering to use the tools available to them, according to the
Annenberg Public Policy Center. Not because they don't care about
them. Most are simply uninformed. The television industry has done
a poor job telling us that the v-chip is available. And hype over
TV violence has slowed, once again, since no one in Washington is
trying to use it for political brownie points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know that television stations must air three hours a
week of educational children's programs. Is that true?''
</P>
<P>
   True, but their version of educational TV is scary. I mean,
``Saved by the Bell'' or anything animated counts, but these shows
are hardly educational.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, how do you know what's educational and what's not?''
</P>
<P>
   They're labeled on the screen with an ``E/I,'' which means
``educational and informative.'' Although, they've got to be
laughing at that themselves. It's ludicrous. Just like the other
labels on episodes of shows like ``Friends.'' I don't know of a
single person who actually uses them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, are those labels in your paper, in TV Guide?''
</P>
<P>
   Nope. And nope. And there's more. The networks are routinely
taking advantage of FCC rules that now allow them to pre-empt
Saturday morning E/I shows with whatever they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why can they do that?''
</P>
<P>
   It's TV. They can do anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why?''
</P>
<P>
   It's all-powerful and all-knowing. And guess who gave them the
power? We did. Hate to put you on the spot, but how many TVs are in
your house?
</P>
<P>
   ``Four.''
</P>
<P>
   Where?
</P>
<P>
   ``Living room, three in bedrooms, one in the kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   That's five.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh ... five.''
</P>
<P>
   The kitchen?
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to watch while I cook, wash dishes. It's more like
background noise, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   Three bedrooms?
</P>
<P>
   ``My son has one. My daughter has hers. And we have one in our
bedroom. It sounds like a lot but I don't know what we'd do with
only one TV. I guess it's not a good thing, but ...''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly gives your children a sense of what you consider
important. Plus, you can't watch what they watch when they're in
their rooms alone, their doors closed, the sound down. But you're
not alone. In the survey you speak of, while parents expressed
concern about their children's viewing habits, as you do, more than
half of the kids surveyed have TVs in their rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, it's a matter of just turning the thing off? Or just
making sure only family-oriented shows are shown?''
</P>
<P>
   How to protect a child from the rude shocks of the tube is a
question answered in each household, depending on what your kids
watch and for how long. Forcing all TV to conform to a
safe-for-kids standard seems unfair to adults. Advisories that warn
of excessive violence are fine, but who guarantees what kids will
do when they're alone in their rooms? This is what prompted the
whole v-chip thingie you speak of.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what's the answer? I feel like we're talking in circles
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Look, violence and sex are enduring parts of popular culture,
and nobody would be worrying all that much about them if daily life
weren't so filled with both as well. As long as there are buyers
for sex and violence, there will be sellers of it. Want my advice?
Find your personal comfort zone, whether it's the v-chip or simply
limiting TV watching in your house. Or how about simply getting
those TVs out of your kids' rooms?
</P>
<P>
   ``That sounds like the toughest one. Got any ideas on how to
break it to them?''
</P>
<P>
   Bribery?
</P>

CABLE NETWORK CHOOSES HARLEM FOR OFFICE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAYSON BLAIR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Black Entertainment Television, the nation's only
24-hour cable network meant for African-Americans, has selected an
East Harlem office building for the location of a New York office
and studio, company officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The company's long-awaited New York office will be a production
operation and headquarters for its music division, which is one of
three divisions that provide original programming for the network.
It will be in a former office building on East 106th Street, near
Park Avenue, and is scheduled to open in September, in time for the
beginning of the fall television season.
</P>
<P>
   Officials did not disclose the cost of construction of the
facilities or the price of the lease.
</P>
<P>
   Black Entertainment Television, a subsidiary of Washington-based
BET Holdings II, is the latest in a long list of large corporations
to make substantial investments in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Magic Johnson Theaters, Harlem's first multiplex,
opened in the six-level $66 million Harlem USA shopping and
entertainment complex at 125th Street and Frederick Douglass
Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   The complex is the home to stores for several national chains,
including HMV records, Disney, Old Navy and Modell's Sporting
Goods.
</P>
<P>
   Other developments in the area include a new retail complex
planned between Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard and Malcolm X
Boulevard and a new 50,000-square-foot shopping market planned for
145th Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``By transferring much of our music-oriented programming to New
York City, we put BET right in the center of the music universe,''
Curtis Gadson, the network's vice president for programming, said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will give us greater access to the top talent for both
appearances and performances on our shows.''
</P>
<P>
   A 10,000-square-foot office space and 7,000-square-foot studio
are expected to be completed by the end of the summer, officials
said. There will be 10 to 15 full-time workers housed in the
complex, and dozens of other contract employees, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the NBC, CBS and MTV studios with windows that overlook
Times Square and allow for participation from audience members on
the street, BET's studio will be entirely enclosed, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is different from what our counterparts have done in Times
Square,'' said Michael Lewellen, a spokesman for BET.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not have windows that look out on a New York vantage
point, but the flavor of the shows will be New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said that several of the shows, including new
music programs for the fall season called ``106th and Park'' and
``BET in NY,'' will take on a New York setting, with video disc
jockeys getting outdoors and using the city as a backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to bringing new jobs, Lewellen said that the company
also hopes to provide work to television and music contractors now
in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   The move to New York is a part of a three-pronged strategy in
which the company will put its music division in New York, its
entertainment division in Los Angeles and its news programming in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In June, BET announced plans to cut approximately 50 positions
in its network operations, programming and production departments.
The cuts were attributed to technological upgrades and the
network's decision to open the New York office.

FALLING IN LOVE, ALL OVER AGAIN, WITH TURNER FALLS IN OKLAHOMA
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by TURNER FALLS-HOW TO) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICIA RODRIGUEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIS, Okla. _ There is no slow-moving Lazy River inner-tube
ride at Turner Falls. No twisty-turny, high-speed fiberglass water
slide; no imported fake-sand beach fronted by an automated
artificial wave pool.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, what you get at this city park just miles across the
Oklahoma-Texas border, is what nature intended.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of this park, the oldest in the state, is the
graceful 77-foot-tall waterfall, created where the sweetly named
Honey Creek cascades over the Arbuckle Mountains. In the park's
1,500 wooded acres, visitors can wade in the clear creek, clamber
across boulders and follow gentle paved trails, explore caves and
splash around in two natural swimming holes.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there have been improvements over the years _ a
playground, campsites, rustic cabins, concession stands selling
snow cones and corn dogs and sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
   But coming here, you get the sense that Turner Falls hasn't
changed in decades. And that no one especially wants it to.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one of the diamonds in the rough of Oklahoma,'' says
Jerry Fullerton, the Turner Falls park manager who was Davis city
manager when the city took over the park's management in 1975. The
city government ``has done a lot to keep it up over the years. But
we don't want it to ever get too big or too fancy.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   After the two hours' drive up the largely flat Interstate 35
from Dallas-Fort Worth, the terrain changes as you approach the
falls, past Ardmore and Lake Murray, and into the rolling
tree-covered hills of the Arbuckle Mountains. Just after the first
turnoff to the falls on U.S. 77 _ a road built, according to an
aged plaque, by prison labor in 1925-26 _ there is a pullout for a
paved lookout area.
</P>
<P>
   Step out of your car here in the morning, and the air is cool,
smelling slightly of cedar. Walk down a few steps to the fenced-off
lookout, where, even without paying 50 cents to peer through the
bolted-down binoculars, you can get a great view of the waterfalls,
cascading into a small green-blue pool.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the falls have been a tourist attraction of sorts for
more than 100 years. Though some accounts have it that soldiers
from nearby Fort Arbuckle visited the site as early as 1851, the
more accepted story goes that in 1860, an Anglo settler named
Mazeppa Turner married a Laura Johnson, who was a Chickasaw.
Because of her heritage, he was allowed to claim some land north of
the falls, and the family built a cabin there. Impressed by the
beauty of the falls, Turner would take all the family's visitors to
see them up close.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while, people would just say, let's go see Turner's
Falls,'' Fullerton says. ``That just became what everyone called
them.''
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1900s, the area around the falls, including the
gently flowing Honey Creek and the swimming holes it created, were
a popular summer destination. Privately owned resorts and cabins
were built, including a small rock ``castle,'' the remains of which
loom over Honey Creek today. The park switched back and forth
between being managed by private operators and the city of Davis
until 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Though the city has modernized and maintained the park
infrastructure, much of it looks like it must have 40, 50 or even
75 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the roads and buildings, such as the rock bathhouse and
the trading post, were built in the 1930s by WPA workers, and they
still have the look of an old-fashioned summer camp. Where
structures have been rebuilt _ like a bridge repaired by a
volunteer group of Vietnam veterans after a flood in '90 _ the
original style has been followed.
</P>
<P>
   A playground is outfitted with old-style metal equipment, the
kind that was a fixture on schoolyards in the '60s. There's a tiny
chapel, with a stained-glass cross and four curved wooden pews just
big enough to seat four families; devotionals are held each Sunday
morning. Wooden picnic tables are scattered around the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The nearest town is Davis, a community of about 2,500 just a
couple of miles from the park's entrance, and the other amenities
in the area are strictly small-town. Local motels and cabins are
definitely on the rustic side, with simple furnishings; these are
not the types of luxurious bed-and-breakfasts where you'll find
Egyptian cotton sheets or marble bathroom counters. Dining options
tend toward family-style barbecue and catfish places; you can find
good food, but it's far from fancy.
</P>
<P>
   But then, that's not why you would come to this corner of
Oklahoma. The draw is the water, cool and crisp.
</P>
<P>
   The most-photographed and prettiest swimming area is the natural
pool into which the falls empty. You reach it by walking less than
a quarter of a mile into the woods on a paved path, below an old
stone castle and other abandoned cabins perched on the low cliffs.
But all along the way, you'll see kids and adults playing in the
slow-moving Honey Creek, wading or swimming or simply sitting in
the shallow water, absorbing the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Day visitors and campers _ and the park may get 20,000 daily on
a summer holiday weekend _ tend to be repeat guests, some of them
replicating the family vacations they enjoyed as kids 20 or more
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few weeks ago, park manager Fullerton says, he met a
couple visiting the park for the day, happy to explain why they'd
chosen this spot for a day trip: They'd been married at the park 50
years earlier, and thought it would be fun to see it again.
</P>
<P>
   They probably thought it hadn't changed a bit.

IS IT FUSION? TO SAY THE LEAST 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL STRAUSS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With Senor Coconut, the truth is stranger than the fiction,
which is pretty strange itself. Released this week on the record
label Emperor Norton, the second album by Senor Coconut, ``El Baile
Alleman'' (Spanish for German Dance), masquerades as a collection
of songs by the pioneering German electronic band Kraftwerk as
performed by a Latin-music combo led by an eccentric South American
composer, arranger and dancer known as Senor Coconut.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that Senor Coconut is an alias for an innovative
German producer who decided that engaging in the usual electronic
dance-music tradition of obscuring his identity by releasing albums
and singles using more than two dozen pseudonyms still wasn't
affording him enough privacy. Then, while in bed with the flu in
1996, he had a vision.
</P>
<P>
   Born Uwe Schmidt but best known for the music he has been
releasing since 1990 under the names Atom Heart and Lassigue
Bendthaus, he was trying to think of ways to blend Latin music with
electronic dance when he suddenly awoke with the image of an album
cover with the name Senor Coconut in his mind. He began working on
the album in Frankfurt, Germany, but soon decided that he might as
well move to Latin America, for both the new cultural experience
and the additional cloak of privacy. So he told his friends he was
moving to Chile. None of them believed him until he actually packed
his bags and left for Santiago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living in Chile, I'm not getting too many phone calls from
press and record labels and distributors,'' he said by telephone
from his home there. ``It's a different life here. And being in a
different culture changes your perception of things. Things are not
as precise and tight as in Germany, for example, and because of it
I'm making different music.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the beauty of Senor Coconut's ``Baile Alleman.'' Where
his previous Coconut record, ``El Gran Baile,'' was a frenetic
Latin-tinged take on drum and bass, this one uses an opposite
approach. The rigidity and technological precision of the
electronic dance music that Kraftwerk helped invent in the '70s has
been removed, as if it were the spine from an animal, causing
machine-deifying songs like ``The Robots'' and ``Trans-Europe
Express'' to collapse into fun, loose cha-chas, merengues and
cumbias.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could listen to the album just as entertainment and
nothing too profound,'' Schmidt said. ``But at the same time
there's the idea of a fake Third World band covering First World
avant-garde music. What does it mean? I always refer to it as a big
absurd question mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know Latin music, you know that the people making it
don't have any connection to the whole history of electronic music
like in Europe. A Latin musician would never make a Kraftwerk
cover: There's no compatibility. So a person in Europe like me had
to move here to make an artificial connection with Latin music to
do it. And it works musically, but at the same time it seems so
bizarre: A German living in Chile programming Kraftwerk.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most interesting juxtapositions on the album is his
version of ``Autobahn.'' In the original, Kraftwerk took a Beach
Boys-like refrain and mechanized and streamlined it for the
automobile, droning, ``Fun, fun, fun on the autobahn.'' In Senor
Coconut's laid-back cumbia version, the sand and sun return to the
refrain, mixing now with the tire rubber and pavement.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt said that when he sent out early demo versions of the
album, an unmarked copy fell into the hands of Kraftwerk members,
who thought at first that a Latin band was actually performing
their music. When Kraftwerk learned the truth, its members, known
for being extremely reclusive, critical of cover versions, and
somewhat litigious, actually liked the music and struck up a
dialogue with Schmidt. They had only one demand: That Senor
Coconut's version of ``Radio-Activity'' be dropped from the album.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought my version was too happy for the content, which I
didn't think was the case,'' Schmidt said. ``Because a Latin band
could only cover it that way. I told them that this means that a
First World band would prohibit a Third World band from covering
its song because the versions are too light.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to have a discussion to explain that it's a First
World stereotype to think that Latin music is a joke and that
nobody would think bad about Kraftwerk even if they do see the song
in a funny way, but they insisted.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt released two other recommended albums last year: One of
more traditional cover songs, ``Pop Artificielle,'' under the name
Lassigue Bendthaus and an electro-acoustic emulation of a jazz
trio, ``Templates,'' under the name Flanger (a collaboration with
Burnt Friedman). But for the rest of this year he is focusing on
Senor Coconut, hoping to take it on the road if he can get
financial support. As if the album itself wasn't already enough of
a mishmash, he has a six-piece Danish band learning Latin dances to
back the Venezuelan singer who learned German lyrics for the album.

ITEM PRICING GATHERS DUST FOR SOME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have you ever noticed the different retail philosophies of Home
Depot and CVS?
</P>
<P>
   When you go into a CVS to buy shaving cream, you find the price
marked on the can as well as on the shelf under the can. But when
you go into Home Depot to buy a package of light bulbs, the price
is only on the shelf.
</P>
<P>
   By stamping prices on individual items in its stores, CVS is
complying with a regulation of the Massachusetts attorney general
that carries the force of law. Home Depot, which says the
regulation is too costly to implement and too prone to errors, is
flouting that law.
</P>
<P>
   CVS's approach is definitely more consumer friendly. It lets
shoppers identify prices more easily, compare prices away from the
shelf, and spot scanner errors right at the register. But it's one
of those things most consumers don't pay attention to unless
there's a problem. (I had a problem last week at Home Depot when I
bought a drain spout that had no price anywhere.)
</P>
<P>
   I've been agonizing about item-pricing lately because my sense
is that Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly's support for
item-pricing is wavering in the face of retail opposition.
Nationally, item-pricing's popularity seems to be waning, with only
a handful of states and municipalities still requiring prices on
individual store items. The question facing Massachusetts consumers
is whether we should join the national trend or buck it.
</P>
<P>
   We can thank Colman Herman for bringing the issue to the
public's attention. A frequent shopper at the Home Depot in Quincy,
Mass., he became annoyed at the company's disregard for the
item-pricing regulation and decided to do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   He first asked Reilly's office to enforce its own regulation,
but no one there would listen to him. Reilly has never enforced the
regulation. His aides say they receive few complaints about it and
consider it a low priority.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, Herman last September filed a complaint against Home
Depot's Quincy store in small claims court. He won, but Home Depot
shrugged off the $25 fine. So Herman filed another complaint this
year and when the case was transferred to Quincy District Court he
scored another victory.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Mark S. Coven has ordered Home Depot's Quincy store to
start item pricing by Aug. 16. Home Depot is appealing. The
retailer is not claiming it is in compliance with the law, rather
that Herman was improperly acting as a private attorney general and
Coven was exceeding his authority. The retailer has made no secret
of the fact that it hopes to win on appeal before it has to start
item pricing.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Home Depot's attorney pressed Coven for a stay of his
compliance order, arguing Herman would not be injured by waiting
until the appeal is heard. ``That's because you don't believe in
the validity of this regulation,'' a testy Coven snapped back,
denying the request.
</P>
<P>
   Embarrassed by Herman's success, Timothy J. Shea, chief of
Reilly's public protection bureau, sent a letter to Home Depot in
late May saying the attorney general would support Herman on
appeal. He also directed the chain to bring all of its
Massachusetts stores into compliance, a request Home Depot has
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Shea's letter didn't sound like he was wedded to item pricing.
He said the regulation is the law until it's changed and invited
Home Depot to suggest changes. Home Depot declined comment last
week, but the Retail Association of Massachusetts says it is
working on a proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fortunate that we have an attorney general here that
recognizes that there are some antiquated laws that need to be
updated,'' said Jon Hurst, president of the retail association.
</P>
<P>
   Hurst said item pricing was enacted in Massachusetts in the
early 1970s, a time when there were no scanners and check-out
personnel needed help keeping track of prices. Today, Hurst said,
marking prices on individual items only increases the potential for
pricing errors. And he said item pricing takes personnel away from
customer service functions and drives up retail costs as well as
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Downey, district manager for Home Depot, said in an
affidavit it would cost the chain $250,000 a year per store to
comply with the item-pricing regulation and deplete an already
understaffed sales force. ``Eventually this will harm Home Depot's
customers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Reilly, Herman says he is amenable to changes in the
item-pricing regulation as long as consumers are protected.
``Consumers have to have an easy, effective means when they're
checking out to make sure what they're being charged is what the
item is priced at,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Reilly will adopt that same view is unclear. What is
clear is that Reilly is not as big a fan of item pricing as
Attorney General Jennifer M. Granholm of Michigan, who not only
supports that state's item-pricing law but aggressively enforces
it.
</P>
<P>
   She and her predecessor have sued such retailers as Kmart, Sears
&AMP; Roebuck, Staples, Wal-Mart and, yes, even Home Depot for failing
to comply with the state's item-pricing law.
</P>
<P>
   Chris DeWitt, spokesman for Granholm, said Michigan residents
love the item-pricing law. He said it allows consumers to determine
whether they were overcharged, which surveys indicate is fairly
common.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've brought a lot of public attention to this issue,''
DeWitt said. ``This is one of the most, if not the most, popular
consumer laws in Michigan.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Long-distance options
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reader reaction to last week's column on long-distance
alternatives was heavy. Some didn't like my attitude, others did,
and many sent in their own long-distance suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   Several people said they did not like BigZoo.com as much as
Marianne Stevenson, who I quoted. Their chief complaint was busy
signals getting through to the toll-free number for the
3.9-cents-a-minute prepaid service. ``The phone calls might as well
be free if you can't make them when you want to,'' said James
Pringle.
</P>
<P>
   Other readers offered some very promising long-distance
suggestions. Jock Gill, for example, suggested www.erbia.com, which
is charging 5.9 cents a minute plus a 3 percent universal access
fee and what it calls a $1 Federal Communications Commission
charge. Sign up online or at 877-549-6001.
</P>
<P>
   John Strom suggested GTC Telecom, which he said charges 5 cents
a minute plus a universal service fee and other government charges.
GTC can be reached online at gtctelecom.com or at 800-486-4030.
</P>
<P>
   Elyse Greenberg likes USA Datanet, a long-distance service you
use by dialing a local-access number. It charges 10 cents a minute
but no more than 99 cents a call. It also has a 4.9-cent flat-rate
plan. USA Datanet can be reached at usadatanet.com or by calling
877-532-8263.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Waters sent me an e-mail suggesting several ways to get free
long-distance service. His Web site, www.1888usa.com, is worth
checking out. It offers ways to make cheap calls using a computer
as well as just a plain old phone.
</P>

   Thanks to all.

PUTIN WANTS PRO-RUSSIA CHECHENS TO JOIN POLICE FORCE IN CHECHNYA 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Stung by rising casualties, President Vladimir Putin
promised Thursday to reduce the use of Russian policemen in
Chechnya and turn over more law enforcement responsibilities to
pro-Moscow Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's pledge followed a recent string of bombings that killed
at least 33 Russian troops and policemen, including members of a
police unit from Chelyabinsk, a city in the Ural Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third major attack in recent months against the
special Russian police units, known as OMON, that have been
dispatched to Chechnya to keep order in towns and cities seized by
the Russian army.
</P>
<P>
   The assaults have brought the cost of the war home to the
Russian heartland and created a potential political problem for the
new president, who was elected largely because of his forceful
policy toward Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Yegor Stroyev, the governor of the Oryol region who is known for
his loyalty to the Kremlin, summed up the sour mood Thursday.
``What is going on in Chechnya is more than a tragedy,'' Stroyev
said. ``The military is telling us that large-scale operations are
over, but why then do so many of our boys die there? How did the
death of police officers from Chelyabinsk become possible in Argun?
These questions must be answered.''
</P>
<P>
   During a surprise visit to the Mozdok military base near
Chechnya Wednesday, Putin reviewed the deteriorating situation with
his top security aides. The Mozdok meeting _ Putin's first visible
move on Chechnya since the Sunday bombings _ was broadcast on the
television news Thursday night and appeared to be a piece of
political theater intended to repair the president's image as a
decisive leader.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Putin sat behind a desk, flanked by Akhmad Kadyrov, the Chechen
and former religious leader whom Putin appointed to administer the
republic. Putin's top military aides and commanders sat in front of
him like a group of errant schoolboys.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, Putin called them to account. Putin began by
addressing his minister of defense, Igor Sergeyev, who snapped to
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has released you from your duties as chief of the
anti-terrorist operation,'' Putin said sternly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sir,'' Sergeyev responded.
</P>
<P>
   Then Putin turned to Vladimir Rushaylo, the interior minister,
whose forces include the police units that were the targets of
recent attacks.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Chelyabinsk militia, which was hit by the
Sunday bomb attack, police units from the town of Sergiyev Posad,
near Moscow, and from the Perm region in the Ural Mountains have
suffered high casualties in deadly ambushes.
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to these attacks, Putin said that Russia must
``gradually stop sending scores of law-enforcement people to
Chechnya.'' Instead, he ordered the interior minister ``to involve
local citizens in the work of law-enforcement bodies in Chechnya
more boldly and energetically.``
</P>
<P>
   Putin noted that the Chechen public has a better idea than the
Russian troops of who was loyal to Moscow and who supported the
rebels. Or as Putin put it, ``the latest events have shown that
large-scale tragedies did not happen in those places where local
police officers were working.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of turning over responsibility to pro-Russia Chechens
is much easier said than done. Russian authorities have long sought
to develop a Chechen militia.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent effort involved a Chechen paramilitary unit
controlled by Bislan Gantermirov, the former major of Grozny who
was jailed for embezzlement but released and appointed to a Russian
government post so that he could fight on the Russian side.
</P>
<P>
   Gantamirov's men, however, played only a minor role in the
capture of Grozny, the Chechen capital. He and his men were
recently discharged from their posts after Russian authorities in
Chechnya charged that his 300-odd man force had failed to carry out
its duties and had vanished along with their weapons. Gantamirov is
also a rival of Kadyrov. Still, Gantamirov was at the Mozdok
meeting.

<P>
   Despite the rising Russian death toll _ more than 2,300 Russian
troops have died during the conflict, 61 just last week _ there is
no mass anti-war movement in Russia, and much of the public seems
to despise the rebels more than ever. Still, there is a growing
unease over the way the war is being fought and a sense of
pessimism that a decisive victory can ever be achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to win the public relations battle at home, the Russian
military has sought to portray the Sunday bombings, which involved
five trucks loaded with munitions and operated by suicide drivers,
as the desperate acts of militants who are on their last legs.
</P>
<P>
   Russian military officials vowed to wipe out the last remnants
of the rebel resistance in special operations mounted by the
Russian military.

<P>
   The situation in Chechnya on Thursday, however, remained tense.
Gudermes, the administration center of the republic, was closed to
civilian traffic. Only military convoys and police units were
allowed to enter and leave. And the Russian media reported that
Russian checkpoints and outposts came under fire 14 times Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kremlin says that more emphasis should be placed on
special operations,'' said the newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta, which
is controlled by the tycoon Boris Berezovsky. ``This is something
we have been hearing for months already, with nothing to show for
it. The situation is further damaged by the military's inability to
defend itself.``

SWIMMER REDISCOVERS TRANQUILLITY IN THE POOL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 ATTN: Tenn., Calif. )  (EDS: Note the harsh language in graf 7.)  
 By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Next month, Alison Terry will try to become the first black
swimmer to make the American Olympic team, having already made the
more important splash of self-discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Earning an Olympic berth as a freestyler would affirm the
rejuvenation of a career that began with great promise, ended in
abandonment and the despair of a suicide attempt, then re-emerged
after five years with her racial awakening and a personal mission
to bring the sport to inner-city neighborhoods where opportunities
long have been denied or dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has been able to redefine herself as a swimmer, a mentor,
a leader,'' said Alan Voisard, who is both Terry's coach and her
fiance. ``She has a great understanding now of who she is.''
</P>
<P>
   Born 26 years ago to a black father and a white mother, Terry
said she felt as a teen-ager in San Diego the societal tug of war
to declare herself one race or the other. She had little contact
with her father when she was younger, and as she began to excel at
swimming, a world as white as a bathing cap, she entered private
school and began to change the way she dressed. She said she became
ashamed of her frizzy hair, hiding it under a cap or a hooded
sweatshirt, and using products to straighten her wavy locks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really started to lose who I was,'' Terry said in a recent
interview. ``I think I was trying to emulate more the white person
and really thinking it was more important to move out of my
community. Now I've come full circle. I think it's very important
for kids to realize that opportunities can be available to them
right there in the black community, and that being successful
doesn't mean you have to move out.''
</P>
<P>
   This self-realization was not easily achieved, however, and her
swimming career was nearly drowned.
</P>
<P>
   By 1990, Terry had become a national junior freestyle champion.
A year later, she graduated from high school and intended to delay
college for a year to compete in the Olympic trials for the 1992
Summer Games in Barcelona, Spain. But her coach quit unexpectedly
before the trials. Stunned, untethered, she relocated up the
California coast to Mission Viejo, but she was unhappy and
indifferent about training. While her brimming talent and light
coppery skin had allowed her comfortable entry into the swimming
world, Terry met crude resistance when someone scrawled
``nigger''on her car, according to her mother, Debra Terry. Alison
moved back to San Diego and attended the 1992 Olympic trials as a
spectator, not a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was totally devastated,'' Alison Terry said. ``I was just
trying to hang on, dealing with other things, trying to find my own
identity.''
</P>
<P>
   She entered the University of Tennessee in the fall of 1992 on
scholarship, but she was still unnerved from losing her club coach
and her chance at the Olympic trials. She said she clashed with her
college coach, began skipping classes and training, and was kicked
off the team. She left school in February 1993. For five years she
would not compete.
</P>
<P>
   She began bartending, smoking, hanging with a rough crowd. She
said she felt depressed, guilty about leaving swimming, but not
strong enough emotionally to return. ``I felt like I had let
everybody down,'' Terry said. She entered a relationship that she
described as abusive, and her self-esteem plummeted. At her lowest
moment she said she used a razor blade to slice her left wrist,
which still bears a scar after six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt so sorry for myself, and at the time I was so weak I
didn't think there was a way out,'' Terry said. ``I can't imagine
being that sad now. I look back, and I don't know if I really
wanted to commit suicide. If I wanted to go, I would have. Maybe it
was my way of asking for help.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother said she was hospitalized briefly to treat the wound
and received counseling. Trying to regain her personal ballast,
Terry enrolled in San Diego's Mesa College to study black history.
She would be greatly influenced by Starla Lewis, the chairwoman of
the school's black studies department, who persuaded Terry to
decide her own identity, not one that society would decide for her.
Lewis also told her not to frustrate herself by trying to adhere to
white standards of hair, beauty and physical appearance. Where she
once hid her hair under a cap, Terry now lets it cascade off her
shoulders and she has an endorsement for hair-care products that
enables her to train fulltime. She has also mended the broken ties
to her father.
</P>
<P>
   ``She changed Alison's life,'' said Debra Terry, a budget
officer for the San Diego Lifeguard Service and a community
activist who had taken her daughter to anti-apartheid rallies as a
girl but who admittedly had not fully recognized her identity
struggles later on. ``Sometimes it takes the right person saying
the right thing at the right time. From black history classes, she
learned about her ancestry, which gave her better perspective and
pride and some justifiable anger.''
</P>
<P>
   Alison began to embrace her black heritage and, along with her
mother and others, she began to develop swimming programs at San
Diego's inner-city high schools, to recruit members of minority
groups as lifeguards, to teach beach safety at elementary schools
and to assist in learn-to-swim courses. This year, San Diego has
agreed for the first time to keep inner-city pools open year-round,
Terry said. These are small victories in a much larger battle that
she believes should be waged against a lack of facilities,
insufficient programs, a lack of interest and discouragement that
linger from the days of segregation and persistent racial myths
that blacks somehow lack the physical capabilities to be good
swimmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't give the kids a chance to participate, you'll
never know how much talent is out there,'' Terry told the officials
at Lincoln High in San Diego as she encouraged them to start a
swimming program, which they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's really important to have a black swimmer on the
Olympic team,'' Terry said. ``That inspires me, to be in a position
to be a role model for a lot of kids that just don't see swimmers
every day, or don't see the sport as being a possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, inspired by coaching high school swimmers, she
realized that if she was encouraging them to pursue their own
passions, she should pursue hers as well. She began swimming again,
with the idea of making the 2000 Olympic team in Sydney, Australia.
Only two Americans will qualify in the open 100-meter freestyle,
but the top six finishers at the trials will qualify for Olympic
relays. An outside chance is a chance worth taking for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I have that perfect race inside me,'' Terry said. ``I
believe in myself. That's the No. 1 thing, believing you are going
to be there. If you have any doubts, forget it. I'm not doubting
myself. I did for way too long. And I'm not anymore.''

&HT;     CRUISE LINE ACCUSED OF DUMPING IN SAN FRANCISCO BAY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JANE KAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A Royal Caribbean Cruises ship returning from an
11-day Alaska voyage last September dumped chemicals into the San
Francisco Bay so noxious that they chased away the sea lions,
according to a Las Vegas couple who were passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Only two months earlier in July, Royal Caribbean agreed to pay
$18 million after pleading guilty to dumping oil and hazardous
chemicals from nine ships into U.S. coastal waters.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, prompted by the new charges by Alan and Maxine
Silver of Las Vegas, environmentalists began legal proceedings to
sue Royal Caribbean under the federal Clean Water Act.
</P>
<P>
   Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund, representing the Bluewater
Network in San Francisco, sent a letter of intent to file a
lawsuit. The 60-day notification period gives government regulators
an opportunity to act, if they wish.
</P>
<P>
   The environmentalists also sent the Silvers' allegations to
Kimberly Brandon, president of the San Francisco Port Commission.
The group asked the commission to enforce violations of the San
Francisco Municipal Code and state codes relating to resources,
fish and game, and harbors and navigation.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Sheehan, a spokesman for Royal Caribbean, a Liberian
corporation based in Miami, said the company ``flatly denies all
allegations by the Bluewater Network that its ship, Mercury,
discharged illegally and/or polluted San Francisco's harbor in any
way on Sept. 21, 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheehan said Royal Caribbean's Celebrity Cruises, which operates
the Mercury, maintains ``a strict no-discharge policy for all of
its operations within 3 miles of shore, including while its ships
are in port.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that ``the ship's operations are recorded and verified
in a series of logs, maintained and reviewed by an environmental
officer on board the ship. These records were reviewed earlier this
year by an independent, external environmental auditing firm, with
no irregularly being found.''
</P>
<P>
   But one environmentalist disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's outrageous that a company with so many felony convictions
for illegal dumping thinks it can continue this activity in the San
Francisco Bay,'' said Russell Long, executive director of Bluewater
Network, a project of the San Francisco-based Earth Island
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Silvers, on Sept 21 the Mercury docked at San
Francisco's Pier 35. As the passengers disembarked, the Silvers
stayed on their veranda watching sea lions playing nearby. They
smelled a strong, noxious chemical odor emanating from below, they
said in a written account to Bluewater Network.
</P>
<P>
   They looked down at the water and saw the source - a white,
frothy liquid being discharged from the ship, accompanied by a
rainbow sheen of an oil slick, they said. The discharge continued
for 30 minutes or more and was so caustic that the sea lions
scattered, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The Silvers say the chemicals smelled like perchloroethylene, a
solvent used by the ship's on-board dry cleaning operation.
</P>
<P>
   Incensed by what they saw, they photographed it. They called
governmental environmental agencies, and when they couldn't get a
satisfactory response, they called Bluewater Network.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations came two months after Royal Caribbean settled
criminal charges against it by paying the $18 million fine. Royal
Caribbean pleaded guilty to 21 felonies, six of which were for
illegally discharging perchloroethylene at several U.S. ports. The
other felonies had to do with routine illegal dumping of oil and
lying to government officials.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, Jack Williams, president of Royal Caribbean
International, another company owned by Royal Caribbean Cruises
Ltd., signed a statement admitting to dumping by the Song of
America ship in New York harbor. Every week in the summer and fall
of 1994 and 1995, he said, the ship drained about 50 gallons of
photo lab chemicals, including toxic silver. Once a month, the ship
dumped 20 gallons from the dry cleaning shop, including
perchloroethylene.
</P>
<P>
   While discharging certain toxic chemicals in ports is clearly
illegal, environmentalists are at odds with state and federal
governments over regulation of a whole range of wastewater. Many
regulations offer exemptions to ships that aren't available to land
sources.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the Bluewater Network asked the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency to reconsider these exemptions and enforce the
Clean Water Act as strictly for ships as for factories and public
water treatment systems.
</P>
<P>
   The group argued that ships were ``floating cities, no different
from any municipality that has numerous streams of pollution
including sewage, hazardous waste, garbage and gray water.''
</P>
<P>
   The California Legislature is considering a bill that would
require cruise ships to report monthly discharges to the state
Water Resources Control Board, which would release the findings in
three years. The bill was passed by the Assembly and goes to the
Senate Environmental Quality Committee for a hearing in August.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise line industry opposes the bill, saying monitoring
would be expensive, burdensome and unnecessary.

`SCARY MOVIE': BILLED AS A SPOOF, BUT IT PARODIES ITSELF 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By A.O. SCOTT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Scary Movie'' belongs to a venerable tradition of pop-culture
spoofing that includes Mad magazine's movie parodies, the song
stylings of Weird Al Yankovich, ``Forbidden Broadway'' and the
great ``Airplane'' movies of the late '70s and early '80s. But
these are hard times for satirists, given the pervasiveness of
knowing self-mockery in everything from television commercials to
campaign speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Keenen Ivory Wayans has made a specialty of sending up the
conventions of genre movies _ blaxploitation in ``I'm Gonna Git You
Sucka'' (1989) and hip-hop ghetto melodrama in ``Don't Be a Menace
to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood'' (1996).
But in ``Scary Movie'' _ which was going to be called something
like ``Scream If You Still Know What I Did Last Halloween'' _
Wayans faces a new challenge. How do you make fun of something
that's already a parody of itself?
</P>
<P>
   Wayans, directing from a script by a half dozen people including
his brothers Marlon and Shawn, who also star, doesn't so much
lampoon the ``Scream'' movies as offer the latest remake, this time
as gross-out comedy. ``Scary Movie'' has the feel of a very long
sketch on ``Mad TV'' or on one of the later episodes of ``In Living
Color,'' after Damon Wayans and Jim Carrey had moved on, taking
with them the show's ingenuity and comic spark.
</P>
<P>
   Like most gag-driven farces, it's a hit or miss affair. If
you're amused by jokes involving male genitals, female pubic hair,
flatulence and dismemberment, it should be a big hit. If you're
not, and you haven't seen the half-dozen or so blockbusters it
alludes to (``The Blair Witch Project,'' ``The Matrix,'' ``The
Sixth Sense'' and ``The Usual Suspects'' in addition to the
``Scream'' and ``What You Did Last Summer'' movies), then by all
means miss it.
</P>
<P>
   Like the three installments of ``Scream,'' ``Scary Movie''
assembles a crew of overage teen-agers (``In the movie we'd be
played by actors in their late '20s and early '30s,'' one of them
notes) and sets a robed, masked maniac after them. Anna Faris takes
the Neve Campbell/Jennifer Love Hewitt role; Lochlyn Munro plays
the boyfriend driven mad by her chastity, and Dave Sheridan cruelly
spoofs David Arquette in the role of Officer Doofy. The on-screen
Wayans brothers, with time on their hands since WB canceled their
sitcom, appear as Ray (Shawn), a quarterback with sexual-identity
issues, and Shorty (Marlon), a gangly pothead who gives his life to
save the movie from complete idiocy.
</P>
<P>
   But the plot, as you would expect, is a slapdash piece of
scaffolding on which to hang bits of humor that are annoying less
for their vulgarity than for their tiredness. Couch-bound pot
smokers, prison sex, mannish female gym teachers, those
``Whassssup'' Budweiser commercials _ hasn't it all been done to
death?
</P>
<P>
   OK, there are some funny moments of the sort you may look back
on with embarrassment. I'll admit to laughing at the gym teacher
routine, and at an utterly tasteless moment involving a
cheerleader's severed head being deposited in a Lost and Found bin,
but no more. And a few other scenes convey a sense of squandered
possibility: for example, a fake movie trailer for ``Amistad II''
and a scene of fried chicken eating and mayhem at a showing of
``Shakespeare in Love.'' (``Brad Pitt's ex-girlfriend is a
freak!'')
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Wayans has aimed at the wrong target. Why not poke fun
at the movies that ask for it by taking themselves seriously? How
about ``Saving Erin Brockovitch from the Cider House Gladiator?''
</P>

 &HT;    NADER: BE SURE YOU KNOW MESSAGE BEFORE SENDING IT (a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By ROBERT ROBB(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ralph Nader is being taken seriously as a potential spoiler for
Al Gore in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   But Nader is a serious man, and deserves to have his ideas, as
well as his potential political effect, taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, then again, there may be a correlation between
Nader's rising poll numbers and the lack of attention paid to his
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech accepting the Green Party's presidential
nomination, Nader blamed big business for everything from traffic
jams to how much television children watch. For the past 20 years,
according to Nader, ``big business has been colliding with American
democracy and democracy has been losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader offered the unsettling theory that, since states grant
corporate status, they can take over corporations to
``rehabilitate'' them under ``new leadership.'' Given the breadth
of Nader's indictment, virtually every major American company would
seem a candidate for such ``rehabilitation,'' with the possible
exception of Ben &AMP; Jerry's, if the new owners behave.
</P>
<P>
   In Nader's world, wealth is not created. It just exists, meaning
the only public policy question is how it should be distributed.
</P>
<P>
   Thus this screed: ``Bill Gates' wealth (is) equal to the
combined wealth of the poorest 120 million Americans. Whatever this
enormous imbalance says about the Great Software Imitator from
Redmond, Washington, it means that about tens of millions of
Americans, who work year after year, decade after decade, are
nearly broke.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's assume for a moment that Bill Gates didn't exist, didn't
create Microsoft, and didn't provide the leadership to make it the
standard operating platform for personal computers. Exactly how
would that have put $60 billion, Gates' net worth, in the pockets
of 120 million other Americans? And what would have happened to the
thousands who work at Microsoft, including relatively low-ranking
employees who have become millionaires due to the increase in
Microsoft's stock price?
</P>
<P>
   It is unfair to hold candidates strictly accountable for the
campaign platforms of their parties. But it is fair to assume that
Nader is generally comfortable with the party whose nomination he
accepted, and whose platform is a real eye-opener.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Party would eliminate the limit on the legal liability
of stockholders for the actions of the corporations in which they
invest, and require companies valued over $20 million to have their
corporate charter renewed every 20 years so they can be reviewed
for social responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Workers in any company with more than 10 employees would get to
choose their supervisors and managers, and decide how to organize
the work.
</P>
<P>
   The work week would be reduced to 30 hours, but workers would
still get paid for 40.
</P>
<P>
   There would be a guaranteed annual income of $26,000 a year for
a family of four. Needless to say, there would be universal,
government provided health care, free day care and free education
clear through a graduate degree.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum wage would be $12.50 an hour, and no one could make
more than 10 times that.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah, the U.S. Senate would be abolished. It's just too
undemocratic.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, Nader and the Green Party want to sharply diminish,
if not eliminate, the returns to investment and entrepreneurship. A
market economy cannot function without them, but one suspects that
a market economy isn't what Nader and the Greens really have in
mind.
</P>
<P>
   What's missing in their political worldview is any concept of
liberty, as defined in the document whose 224th anniversary was
celebrated yesterday. The notion that individuals are free to make
their own way, to chart their own course, and reap the rewards of
what they produce.
</P>
<P>
   According to Nader, ``freedom is defined as participation in
power,'' as bone-chilling a formulation as any concocted by the
20th century's great totalitarians.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously there are some Americans who agree with the Nader and
Green Party's social and economic critique and agenda. But that's
not what's driving his numbers. Those are being driven by union
members and others who want to punish Al Gore, primarily for his
free-trade positions.
</P>
<P>
   It's fine if some Americans want to flirt with sending a message
by voting for Ralph Nader. They should just understand precisely
what message it is that they are sending.

`THE DECLINE OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION, PART III': MINOR BUT
TELLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Production notes appear at end of review.)  
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I wasn't born yet,'' says Why-me, the first interview subject
of ``The Decline of Western Civilization, Part III,'' Penelope
Spheeris' latest installment in her documentary series on the
social trajectory of the Los Angeles punk scene.
</P>
<P>
   In the first ``Decline'' (1981), the curdled fomentation of punk
was young and looming. In the second (1988), she spun nasty jokes
on rock 'n' roll, and in this third episode, which is minor but
telling, the movement has become an institution. Many of the young
punks interviewed _ many in their teens, like Why-me _ are
inheritors of a movement that existed before they did and has
calcified into what can only be called ritualized anarchic
behavior. One of them, caught in a crowd scene, says, ``I know a
guy that can suck an Icee through his nose,'' and seconds later, we
see it.
</P>
<P>
   The grand old punk Keith Morris, once part of the most ferocious
Los Angeles punk band, Black Flag (which was a big part of the
first ``Decline''), notes the prevalence of punk nowadays. ``There
was a lot of energy and a lot of anger,'' he observes. ``It wasn't
like it is today, where you could go out on any corner and see punk
rock people.''
</P>
<P>
   Those current punk youths are what the film calls gutterpunks,
who inhabit the streets of Hollywood looking for handouts to live
on. When asking for money, one of the spike-haired panhandlers
says, ``I swear I won't waste it on food.''
</P>
<P>
   There is an air of resignation about punk today. Pain is still a
constant, and it is bewildering to hear the punkers, with piercings
through the bridge of the nose, talk about being beaten by two
types of skinheads, the Nazis and the anti-hate punks, who also
travel in gangs. The anti-hate punks call themselves SHARP _
Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice _ and they practice their own
brand of oppression. Ezzat Soliman talks about the only condition
for admission at the club he owns: no politics. (He also talks
about the kind of music he plays at home. ``I listen to Frank
Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Louis Armstrong,'' he says with a laugh.)
</P>
<P>
   Spheeris often places her interview subjects in front of a gray
wall, with a single light bulb to illuminate the camera setup. One
wishes she had pulled away a bit because in some instances
``Decline'' comes off as the essay of a punk mom worried about her
charges, babyfaces with Mohawks and tattoos that make them look
like Maoris. That feeling also gives the movie a full-on sadness
not found in the previous chapters, and her curiosity and maternal
instinct mitigate some of the plus ca change resonance, especially
since there is less of a community this time around. The little
punkers are mostly loners who don't fit in.
</P>
<P>
   It's odd to see such feelings of naked aggression setting off a
wave of nostalgia. Naked Aggression also happens to be the name of
one of the bands, and its members are interviewed. They are trained
musicians _ one is shown playing classical guitar; the vocalist
noodles on a French horn _ and they are trapped in a paradox. They
talk about the exploitation of punk bands at the hands of indie
labels, which is actually more pronounced than they would receive
from a major recording label. Yet if the bands signed to a major
label, their fans would ignore them. ``That's the irony of it
all,'' one responds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Decline'' is best and most touching when it shows how willing
punk is to eat its young. The anecdotes build momentum and power.
``It certainly hasn't gotten more beautiful,'' Morris muses,
matter-of-factly, ``but the punk rock thing was never a beautiful
thing.'' &QL;

A RISK FOR PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton took a risk worth taking when he invited
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat to Camp David next week for intensive negotiations on the
crucial issues standing in the way of a framework peace accord
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   The invitation is a gamble because, after years of dialogue and
negotiation, the Palestinian and Israeli positions on the issues _
borders, Jerusalem, refugees, and settlements _ remain so far apart
that it is hard for each side to imagine making the compromises a
final-status agreement will require.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few days, distinguished Israeli and Palestinian
voices have warned their leaders against the very compromises that
Clinton is gambling he can persuade Barak and Arafat to make.
Israel's interior minister, Natan Sharansky, said he would resign
because Barak would have to concede too much at a Camp David
summit.
</P>
<P>
   A group of eminent Palestinians _ including the human rights
campaigner Hanan Ashrawi, former Palestinian negotiator Haidar
Abdul Shafi, and Dr. Eyad Sarraj, the child psychiatrist who has
been jailed by Israel and by Arafat's security forces _ signed a
statement calling for ``a final and just settlement, guaranteeing
the right of return and self-determination in a Palestinian
sovereign and independent state with Jerusalem as its capital in
the territories occupied after the fourth of June, 1976 . . .''
</P>
<P>
   These positions have tremendous emotional force among
Palestinians, emanating from a communal narrative about their
history of displacement, deception, and suffering since 1948. There
are also Israelis within their nation's mainstream who approach
these same issues with a fear that even partial concessions to the
Palestinians will expose Israel to intolerable existential threats.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was alluding to such apprehensions when he spoke
Wednesday of how both parties harbor ``intense fears and emotions
and a deep-seated commitment to defend their people's interests.''
Nonetheless, Clinton has done the right thing in summoning Barak
and Arafat to make the ``historic decisions'' that only they can
make and probably only he can cajole them into making.

<P>
   The best reason for donating blood always was and always will be
that it can help save a life. But in recent years evidence has
mounted that, for adult males at least, there might be a side
benefit as well: The gift of blood appears to reduce the risk of
heart disease in the donor.
</P>
<P>
   That likely extra benefit was mentioned in a TV interview last
week by Dr. Harvey Klein, chief of the Department of Transfusion
Medicine of the National Institutes of Health. He pointed to a
comprehensive study of this done in Finland under the auspices of
the University of Kuopio and reported in the American Journal of
Epidemiology.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers followed 2,862 men aged 42 to 60 for an average of
nine years. Of the men in the group who donated blood in the two
years before the study began, just 0.7 percent had a heart attack.
Of the nondonors, 12.5 percent did. The researchers knew that
donors tend to be in better overall health than nondonors, so they
controlled for the risk factors that would vary between the two
groups and still found that donors had an 88 percent reduced risk.
</P>
<P>
   The most commonly accepted theory explaining this is that
donating blood periodically does for men what monthly menstruation
does for women _ it gets rid of excess iron, a suspected risk
factor for heart attacks. After menopause, women's heart attack
rates resemble men's.
</P>
<P>
   Another theory is that the heart benefits because occasional
blood donations spur bone marrow to produce new red blood cells,
which are more flexible than old ones and deliver oxygen better. Of
course, it may be that both phenomena are at work or that other
factors are involved. It is also possible that women benefit from
donating _ it is hard to pin down because heart disease among
pre-menopausal women is so rare.
</P>
<P>
   Blood supplies across the country are perilously low these days
for a number of reasons, including a rise in utilization, which
Klein said may be linked to more frequent surgery in an aging
population. Still, organizations that collect blood are cautious in
describing the secondary benefits of donation _ they are afraid
would-be donors offering their blood strictly for the heart-disease
benefit might lie about aspects of their medical history that would
disqualify them. But the important word is ``strictly.'' If a
healthy but slightly lazy or needle-phobic individual gets an extra
push into a donor center because he wants to do his heart a favor,
that is a benefit to all of us.

FRENCH REASONING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is something spectacularly idiosyncratic about France's
refusal to join 107 other countries in signing a document called
the Warsaw Declaration _ a statement of principles meant to unite
diverse nations in a community of democracies.
</P>
<P>
   In New England, where nonconformism boasts a long and honored
history, it should be possible to admire the courage to stand alone
displayed by France's foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
   The bemusing aspect of the French decision to stand apart from
the other 107 democracies last week, however, is less the
theatrical gesture made by Paris than the reasons given for making
it.
</P>
<P>
   Other statesmen and stateswomen gathered in the chamber of the
Polish parliament spoke of their declaration on the universal
principles of democracy as a text they hoped would have the same
potent effect as the 1975 Helsinki Accords enshrining human rights
as an entitlement of all human beings under all political regimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the United Nations can truly call itself a community of
democracies,'' UN Secretary General Kofi Annan told the conferees,
``the charter's noble ideals of protecting human rights and
promoting `social progress in larger freedoms' will have been
brought much closer.''
</P>
<P>
   But France, rejecting this vision of democracy triumphant, gave
reasons that reason itself would hardly recognize. The French
ambassador to Poland, Benoit d'Aboville, warned against the
creation at the UN of a new, exclusive bloc of democratic states,
one that recapitulates the global divisions of the Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
   Vedrine lectured the 107 countries that failed to follow the
lead of France. ``In Western countries,'' he said, ``the thinking
is that democracy is like religion, and all you have to do is
convert people.'' As an example, he cited America's failure to
convert Saddam Hussein. Sigmund Freud, who has been enjoying a
revival in France, might theorize that French leaders feel a trifle
guilty about their continuing collaboration with the unconverted
Saddam.

&HT;     FORMER SMOKER WHO WON $21.7 MILLION FROM TOBACCO FIRMS DIES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Leslie Whiteley, a former smoker who received
$21.7 million in damages from a San Francisco jury against the
nation's two largest tobacco
</P>
<P>
   companies in March, has died of cancer at age 40.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Whiteley, of Ojai in Ventura County, died Monday in a
Ventura hospital, her attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   The jury's verdict was the first in the nation in favor of a
smoker who
</P>
<P>
   took up the habit after 1965, when the federal government first
required
</P>
<P>
   warning labels on cigarette packages. The companies, Philip
Morris and
</P>
<P>
   R.J. Reynolds, plan to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Whiteley testified that she had started smoking in 1972 at
age 13, using her lunch money to buy cigarettes. She said she had
paid little attention to the warning labels because tobacco
companies promoted the benefits of cigarettes and the government
permitted their sale.
</P>
<P>
   She smoked Marlboros and Camel Lights, averaging two packs a
day, until she quit in 1998, shortly before being diagnosed with
lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco companies attributed Mrs. Whiteley's illness to her
voluntary choice to smoke, despite the warnings, and to her
admitted use of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   But after reviewing internal industry documents, the jury, in a
9-3 verdict, found that the companies were to blame because they
designed cigarettes negligently, then made false or misleading
statements to the public and concealed information about the
dangers of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors awarded Mrs. Whiteley and her husband $1.7 million for
pain and suffering and medical costs, and awarded $10 million in
punitive damages against each company. Superior Court Judge John
Munter upheld the verdict and denied the companies' request for
reduced damages or a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leslie was the unfortunate victim of the tobacco companies'
intentional targeting of children with their addictive and deadly
products,'' said her attorney, Madelyn Chaber.
</P>
<P>
   She said Mrs. Whiteley's estate was entitled to the same damages
she would have received. If a plaintiff dies before the trial ends,
her heirs cannot seek damages for her pain and suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Another San Francisco jury awarded $51 million last year to a
former smoker in a suit against Philip Morris. Munter, who also
presided over that trial, cut the damages in half. The company is
appealing.

JUST PLAIN ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest dispatch from the can't-leave-well-enough-alone front
is the news that ``plain'' M&AMP;Ms will now be called ``milk
chocolate'' M&AMP;Ms. M&AMP;M/Mars is spending $10 million on this name
change because, a spokesman said, ``for a long, long time, our
chocolate has been too good to be called plain.''
</P>
<P>
   The long, long time has been 46 years. In 1954, the basic
chocolate-covered treat, which had been called ``plain chocolate
candies'' since coming on the market in 1941, was switched just to
``plain'' as the peanut version was being introduced.
</P>
<P>
   The company made the switch to ``milk chocolate'' just before
the Fourth of July, when our nation honors its democratic roots. As
the M&AMP;M case illustrates, we may lack a titled aristocracy in this
country, but we throw the verbal equivalents of baronies around
with abandon when we think we can make a buck by gussying up a
workaday product. Vanilla ice cream becomes ``French vanilla.''
Realtors turn porches into ``verandas.'' Used cars are
``pre-owned.''
</P>
<P>
   Something there is in salesmen that can't abide the ordinary.
M&AMP;M spokesman Michael Tolkowsky says calling the candies plain
``never really fit the eating experience of M&AMP;Ms,'' as though that
dreaded word was ever supposed to signal to buyers anything other
than the fact that they weren't getting any of the nutty M&AMP;Ms.
</P>
<P>
   There are, happily, refuges of the generic, including hardware
and building supply stores. To the horror of the Michael Tolkowskys
of the world, such stores stock common nails, No. 2 pine,
carpenter's glue, and flat paint. One suspects that the word
``common'' fits the hammering experiences of carpenters just fine.

`BUT I'M A CHEERLEADER': PINK OUTFITS WILL STRAIGHTEN HER OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``But I'm a Cheerleader'' with its crushingly obvious idea _ a
cheerleader with vaguely gay longings is sent off to a heterosexual
rehab camp _ belongs to that burgeoning category of film best
described as It Would Have Made a Great Sketch on ``Saturday Night
Live'' or ``Mad TV.'' On television, where the guest host would be
chewing his mouth raw trying not to burst out laughing, it would at
least be short, like Robert Smigel's ``Ambiguously Gay Duo''
superhero parody, which began on Dana Carvey's short-lived show
before moving to ``Saturday Night Live.'' The movie's one joke is
apparent very early on, and even if you're only half watching,
you'll be a step ahead.
</P>
<P>
   So campy it reflexively sends an elbow to its own ribs,
``Cheerleader'' has a sweet heroine, Megan (Natasha Lyonne), who is
on her high school's cheerleading squad and dates a football
player. Whenever they make out, she's unengaged by his kisses; she
keeps her eyes wide open, and her gaze wanders over to the other
cheerleaders as her tongue absently dances with his.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheerleader'' lingers over the other girls' crotches in its
opening credit sequence, so Megan's attraction is suggested before
the picture starts. Her parents and friends stage an intervention
and ship her off to True Directions, the hetero camp run by the
tight-jawed Mary (Cathy Moriarty), dressed in form-fitting pink
business suit castoffs from the Mary Kay collection.
</P>
<P>
   The film's leaden jokiness is magnified by having in the cast
actors who telegraph that they are in on the joke. Megan's
conservative, religious parents are played by Mink Stole and Bud
Cort. RuPaul Charles _ yes, that RuPaul _ in a tight T-shirt and
shorts you'd expect to see on a dancer in a Joey Heatherton revue,
is the camp's male soi-disant deprogrammer: ``I'm an ex-gay,'' he
chirps.
</P>
<P>
   At True Directions, the girls' dormitory and outfits are pink.
And the boys' are baby blue, as are their matching shirt, necktie
and shorts ensembles, which look like the kind of thing Regis
Philbin might dress his kids in. The trembling boys, who are
struggling with being reconditioned, are pure stereotypes. And
Moriarty's portrayal as the no-nonsense Mary is so butch that she's
capable of emasculating any man within a five-mile radius. That
would be the only possible reason her son (Eddie Cibrian) is given
to wearing tank tops and Daisy Dukes cutoffs and prancing around as
if he's waiting for his Village People audition. (He's also named
Rock, as if this movie needed any more in-jokes.)
</P>
<P>
   The girls come off better. Lyonne doesn't camp it up; she
settles in, and using her spry optimism and little girl's croak of
a voice, delivers a real performance. Megan is truly surprised when
all the evidence of her gayitude _ a Melissa Etheridge poster,
vegetarianism _ is trotted out before her. Clea DuVall, who plays
Graham, the requisite tough girl and troublemaker, is reminiscent
of the young Moriarty. When Graham runs her hands through her hair
and flirts with Megan, it's only a matter of time before they
tumble. (Their love scenes are played tenderly _ the one area where
the movie takes itself seriously.)
</P>
<P>
   Katharine Towne, a new young actress with a sly, sportive spark,
plays Sinead, one of the girl campers, with a doleful demeanor that
she lampoons mercilessly. Whenever Sinead has to minister to
herself to stop her lesbian impulses _ Mary has given all the girls
zappers to remind them they're no longer gay _ her furtive glee
shows the kind of subtlety the rest of the film could have used.

&HT;     ATM FEES RULING PUZZLES LAWYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BOB EGELKO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A federal judge's decision to strike down local
ordinances banning extra bank ATM fees came as no surprise to
lawyers defending the laws, but they were baffled by his failure
even to mention in the ruling an appellate case that seemed to
allow local regulation of automated teller machines.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said in a 1990 case that
``Congress specifically has declined to restrict state regulation
in the ATM context.'' States, which have the same regulatory powers
as cities, are authorized by federal law to provide ``more
stringent consumer safeguards'' than the national standard for
electronic funds transfers, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was the leading legal authority cited by lawyers for
San Francisco and Santa Monica in defense of their ordinances,
which outlawed extra charges averaging $1.50 for customers who used
another bank's automated teller machine.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Monica City Council approved its ordinance last
October, and San Francisco voters followed in November, but
enforcement of both ordinances was blocked by an injunction issued
by U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker on Nov. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from his general conclusion that cities had no power to
regulate ATM fees, the injunction did not spell out Walker's
reasoning. However, it left both sides expecting his ruling Monday
that struck down the two measures.
</P>
<P>
   Still, lawyers for the city of San Francisco were wondering how
the judge would address the 1990 appellate decision, their
strongest legal authority for local regulatory power over ATMs.
They are still wondering.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make any sense,'' San Francisco Deputy City
Attorney Marc Slavin said Wednesday. ``We argued to him that it did
apply. . . . That case stands for the proposition that local
governments can act on this issue of ATM fees. You would expect
that he would address us, but he chose not to, for reasons of his
own.''
</P>
<P>
   E. Edward Bruce, an attorney for the banks, said Walker's
silence shouldn't be surprising because the 1990 case involved an
entirely separate issue. ``The cities have consistently
misunderstood the (1990) case,'' Bruce said.
</P>
<P>
   As the banks pointed out, the 1990 case differed from their suit
in Walker's court. The appeals court was deciding whether a Nevada
law that let banks impose surcharges on non-customers' use of their
ATMs was an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. (The
court said no and upheld the law.)
</P>
<P>
   Walker had to decide whether local ordinances banning those
surcharges conflicted with federal laws that regulate banking.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the 1990 case is the only discussion of ATM regulation by
a court whose rulings are binding on all federal judges in
California and eight other Western states. If Walker had found that
the ruling defined the law in the case before him, he would have
had to rule in the cities' favor.
</P>
<P>
   In written and oral arguments before Walker, city attorneys
argued that the appellate case was legally controlling, and bank
lawyers argued just as strenuously that the issues in the two cases
were different.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, a judge will say which side's arguments are more
persuasive, and explain why an old ruling does or does not apply to
a new set of facts. Walker's 10-page ruling relied heavily on a
recent decision by another appellate court that overturned an Iowa
ATM law, but did not acknowledge the existence of the 9th Circuit
decision.
</P>
<P>
   He also made no mention of an earlier California Supreme Court
ruling that said states could prohibit excessive or unreasonable
bank fees.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the judge said, as the appellate court ruled in the
Iowa case, local regulation of ATM fees was barred by the National
Bank Act, which lets nationally chartered banks exercise all
``incidental powers'' necessary for the ``business of banking.''
Walker also said the ordinances conflicted with rules adopted by
federal regulators allowing both banks and savings and loans to
charge fees for ATM use.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th Circuit will have the last word on the meaning of its
earlier ruling when it hears the cities' appeal.

   The coldly cynical will see A&AMP;E's decision to air ``Longitude''
in a four-hour block as a crass attempt to persuade the bum-weary
masses to order the film from A&AMP;E Home Video ($59.95, plus shipping
and handling) instead of sitting in front of the television from 8
to midnight Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But if A&AMP;E makes a little money on video orders for
``Longitude,'' who am I to complain? Especially if they pour the
money into other productions of such elegance and splendor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Longitude'' would work better as a two-night presentation. But
A&AMP;E will rebroadcast the film at least four times, making a split
viewing quite possible for the VCR-challenged.
</P>
<P>
   John Harrison and Rupert Gould would have had no trouble
programming VCRs. Harrison, a carpenter born in 1693, was the sort
of self-educated genius who could see possibilities where others
see only problems. Gould, born almost 200 years later, was an
emotionally unstable intellectual with a knack for explaining
complex and abstract concepts in simple terms.
</P>
<P>
   In Dava Sobel's celebrated book ``Longitude,'' on which the film
is based, Gould is an extremely minor player. But director Charles
Sturridge wisely elected to place Gould's contemporary story in
parallel with Harrison's all-consuming effort to solve the great
scientific riddle of his time: how to to determine one's position
at sea.
</P>
<P>
   It was a life-and-death problem equivalent to the modern
challenge of making space travel safe, and most seafaring countries
of the time offered prizes to anyone who could come up with a
reliable way of allowing a sea captain to know precisely where he
was when he was on the bounding main.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gambon is magnificent as Harrison, the unsophisticated
but brilliant carpenter who created a succession of
weather-resistant, motion-proof clocks, each smaller than its
predecessor, to solve the navigational conundrum. A roiling mixture
of ambition, emotion and determination, Gambon's Harrison is easy
to root for when stacked mercilessly against a roomful of stuffy
astronomers and admirals who controlled Britain's Longitude Prize,
equal today to millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Gould isn't as easy to cheer, but he is no less fascinating in
Sturridge's film. A man whose obsession with restoring Harrison's
clocks ruined his marriage and his health, Gould is played with icy
intensity by Jeremy Irons, who is careful never to upstage Gambon
as the parallel stories move back and forth between 18th and 20th
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Though the film is fairly light on the scientific aspects of the
story, it manages to convey the importance of the quest to
calculate longitude precisely. An almost endless parade of
Englishmen in powdered wigs makes it tough to keep track of certain
characters, but ``Longitude'' remains a triumph of filmmaking that
would play as well on the big screen as on a small one.
</P>
<P>
   Longitude. Four-hour movie about an 18th-century man's attempt
to solve the problem of determining one's position at sea, and a
20th-century man's attempt to bring his achievement to light.

   MIDEAST-TALKS (Jerusalem) _ There is a go-for-broke quality to
the Israeli and American approach to the coming Camp David peace
summit, which starts Tuesday with the stated goal of ending a
52-year-old blood-steeped conflict. But for the Palestinians, whose

   JAPAN-U.S.-MILITARY (Tokyo) _ The top U.S. military official in
Okinawa made an unprecedented apology Thursday for an incident on
Monday in which an American Marine was accused of entering a
private residence on the Japanese southern island and sexually
molesting a 14-year-old girl. The display of remorse, which
included a bow of Japanese contrition, was the first time that a
senior U.S. military official had made such an apology, government
officials said. And it came after numerous accusations in recent
years that U.S. soldiers stationed in Okinawa had been involved in
cases of violence and sexual misconduct. The general's apology was
seen as an effort to smooth relations with the people of Okinawa,
who have held angry rallies and protests over the incident in

summit meeting of world leaders that President Clinton is scheduled
to attend. By Calvin Sims.

   GORE (Chicago) _ Asking repeatedly ``whose side are you on,''
Vice President Al Gore on Thursday drew a sharp contrast between
his proposals for Medicare and those of Gov. George W. Bush, and he
branded his Republican opponent as the candidate of powerful
industries. Gore lectured with charts and bar graphs at a suburban

   WEB-B2B-ANTITRUST (Washington) _ As companies in practically
every industry rush to join business-to-business exchanges on the
Internet, regulators are growing concerned that they will face a
rash of new antitrust questions for which they are not prepared.
Known as B2B Web sites, these business-to-business exchanges create
a place for companies in the same industry, be it automobiles or
grain, to buy and sell goods, potentially saving millions of
dollars in back-office costs by setting up a national marketplace
online. By David Leonhardt.

   CBS-BIG-BROTHER (Undated) _ ``Big Brother'' was certainly big

   SOC-WORLD-CUP (Undated) _ Germany will stage the 2006 World Cup,

votes and South Africa 11, with one abstention. (Summary from

   &UR; EDITORS: We will move the following articles from The New York
Times mutual fund report for the first half of 2000. All will move
for release Sunday, July 9, 2000. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-FLOW (Undated) _ If technology remains the obsession of
American investors, where are money managers placing their bets
now? The answers can have all the longevity of a cast member on
``Survivor.'' To trace the path of new-economy investing, fast feet
and a good line of technospeak are required. By Danny Hakim.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-PERFORMANCE (Undated) _ In the long-running debate
between managers of funds that search for cheap stocks and those
that chase the fastest-growing companies, neither was an exultant
winner. The growth funds that had dominated for most of the long
bull market for stocks flamed out, but their value-seeking
counterparts did not exactly soar from their ash piles. An
interest-bearing checking account turned out to be a better place
to stash cash than either broad category of stock fund. By Patrick
McGeehan.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-STRATEGIES (Undated) _ On behalf of financial planners,
academics, investment advisers and self-anointed experts
everywhere, I apologize. It appears that much of what you have been
told over the last 30 years about the benefits of international
diversification has been greatly exaggerated. In fact, according to
a new study, those benefits are less than half as great as
originally thought. By Vivian Marino.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-ESSAY (Undated) _ Commentary: If you are like me, all
these fund family crests leave you cold. Granted, illustrating
something so fuzzy as an investment philosophy is no easy feat but
can't we do any better than a bunch of polygons, sailing vessels
and oak trees? By Patrick McGeehan.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-BONDS (Undated) _ Do not be put off by how eye-glazingly
abstruse the subject sounds: A bill making its way through Congress
to change how government-sponsored agencies like Freddie Mac and
Fannie Mae are regulated could, if enacted, have some profound
effects on the portfolios of millions of ordinary investors. By
Abby Schultz.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-INVESTORS (Undated) _ Meet the managed account, which
many people view as the latest threat to the 75-year-old mutual
fund industry. It used to be that only a privileged few could
afford their own money manager, but in the last few years assets in
privately managed accounts have swelled. Credit, in part, a bull
market that has more than doubled the number of millionaire
households since 1983, to five million. By Danny Hakim.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-JUNKBONDS (Undated) _ Remember junk bonds? It was the
play stuff of Michael Milken, mother's milk of the 1980s
leveraged-buyout craze and eventually a symbol of that decade's
decadence. In recent quarters, junk bonds have logged some of their
worst performance in almost a decade. By Kate Berry.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-MUNIS (Undated) _ For fixed-income investors, there
appears to be a lucrative silver lining in the cloud of rising
interest rates: buying opportunities among closed-end municipal
bond funds. By Carole Gould.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-RETIRE (Undated) _ Because saving for retirement had
become a crucial issue for Americans, The New York Times in 1993
asked five mutual-fund experts how they would invest a hypothetical
nest egg of $50,000 for someone who planned to retire in 20 years
or more. Each quarter since then, the five portfolios have been
reviewed and fine-tuned and their performances compared in these
pages. With results from the second quarter of 2000, the exercise
concludes, and the participants discuss what they, and investors,
have learned along the way. By Carole Gould.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-MANAGERS (Undated) _ There were swoons and rebounds, and
then more again of the same. But by the end of the second quarter,
the stock market had provided enough bad news to push every major
category of United States diversified equity funds into negative
territory for the period. Over all, domestic diversified stock
funds lost 4.3 percent. What funds managed to shine as stormy
weather lashed the markets? Generally, the winners owned shares in
companies in old-economy sectors, like oil and gas, as well as in
health care and some financial services. Managers of three
top-performing funds talked about the resurgence of
once-beaten-down sectors and what they expect from the stock market
during the remainder of the year. By Carole Gould.

   AT&AMP;T-FUTURE (Undated) _ On May 2, AT&AMP;T dropped its bomb on the
company's investors. AT&AMP;T said its operations would grow more
slowly and earn less this year than the company had previously led
investors to expect. The company's shares, which had closed that
Monday at $49, lost $7.0625, shaving more than $25 billion from
AT&AMP;T's market value. And the shares did not bounce back. They lost
more value the next day. And the day after that. And the day after

   SHOE-SALES (Undated) _ Despite the boom in consumer spending,
shoe sales have grown at a minuscule 1.8 percent a year for the
last decade, according to Footwear Marketing Insights, the
Nashville-based industry research arm. That is in keeping with
historical growth, but disappointing compared to the 1980s, when

   DAYTON, Ohio - If nothing else, the band may have the coolest
logo in rock 'n' roll history: that double-struck,
bleeding-typeface that has been with Cheap Trick since its 1977
debut album.
</P>
<P>
   There is more to the band than only that, of course, which is
why Cheap Trick has been kicking around on stages and in studios
pretty much nonstop since that first record.
</P>
<P>
   But even after two more albums, those of us who live outside the
immediate Chicago-Rockford, Ill., region that was the band's home
didn't know much about the power-pop quartet until a few years
later. In 1979, it released ``Live at Budokan'' _ which went down
as Cheap Trick's biggest and best album and which may well be one
of the two or three best live rock albums ever.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of those rare records that nailed a good band on a
great night, when all cylinders were firing and when the crowd was
in sync with the action onstage. Cheap Trick had caught on in Japan
before it caught on here. After this record, the States were on
board. ``Budokan'' went multiplatinum and introduced many Americans
to an unusual-seeming cast of musical characters.
</P>
<P>
   Out front were the handsome ones, singer Robin Zander and
bassist Tom Petersson, both of whom made the girls swoon. Behind
them was Bun E. Carlos, the mustachioed, pudgy drummer who looked a
bit like your band teacher on a smoke break. Off to the side was
Rick Nielsen, who wore funny little ballcaps and checkered
cardigans, played half a dozen guitars all slung around his neck at
once and never seemed able to stand still.
</P>
<P>
   The odd quartet broke out of the late-'70s cookie-cutter
hard-rock image and backed it up with hard, hooky, power pop driven
by huge, crunchy rhythms, brick-wall guitar riffs and Zander's
silvery voice. Between Nielsen's off-center lyrics (does anybody
know exactly what ``Surrender'' is about?) and well-chosen,
spiffed-up covers (''Ain't That a Shame,'' etc.), the band enjoyed
a good ride.
</P>
<P>
   It never soared quite as high again, though it scored hits from
1980's ``Dream Police'' and with ``The Flame,'' included on a '91
best-of disc. Changing labels and producers through the years, the
quartet has never stopped working, though _ and, except for a
seven-year break by Petersson, it has kept the original group
together through commercial highs and lows.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the highs, incidentally, have had to do (again) with
Budokan. ``Budokan II,'' with extra cuts from the original show,
came out in 1993, and a remastered combination of both discs came
out in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Courthouse Square probably won't be jammed with thousands of
screaming Japanese teen-agers tonight when Cheap Trick brings its
once-upon-a-time-hysteria-inducing show to Dayton for Fox Rox the
Square. But then, you never know.

MARGARET CHO'S FILM PROVES HER METTLE AS A COMIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 Our Grade: B+  
 By SEAN AXMAKER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Korean American comedian Margaret Cho made headlines in 1994 by
jumping from a successful stand-up career to fronting America's
first Asian-cast sitcom ``All-American Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   After a solid launch, the show's numbers slipped and a frantic
network tried to redefine the show (``It's too Asian ... no, it's
not Asian enough'').
</P>
<P>
   Cho hit the depths of depression when it was canceled in its
first season. She sank into alcohol and drug addiction before she
pulled herself out of the pit of self-pity and turned her harrowing
experiences into a scathing stand-up act turned one-woman show,
something akin to Julia Sweeney's ``God Said Ha!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the One That I Want'' is a kind of comic healing, a
hilarious yet pointed self-affirmation. The backbone of the show is
her nightmarish experiences with television and her harrowing
efforts to conform to the network's definitions of their ideal
all-American girl _ including launching into a crash diet and
exercise program that came close to killing her _ while denying her
own identity.
</P>
<P>
   It creates a narrative through-line for the act, but the show is
fleshed out with her experiences growing up in San Francisco
``raised by drag queens'' and her trademark impressions of her Old
World, but unexpectedly hip Korean mother.
</P>
<P>
   Lionel Coleman respectfully preserves this triumphant hometown
performance of her 1999 show. Comedy concert films are tricky
things to get right; they rely on delivery, pacing, often subtle
body language, and a responsive crowd, yet they need to play to a
theater audience. Coleman smartly gives us an intimate and up-close
look at Cho's show and keeps the cameras trained on her. We don't
need an audience reaction shot to know she's funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the One That I Want'' is at its best when her rhythm
carries the film, and Coleman's technique is invisible. Only rarely
does he get in the way, such as a few lovely but unmotivated
gliding moves that draw the camera out to long shot. It's pretty
but works against her timing.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the film seamlessly captures the arc of her stories
and her easy connection with the audience. Her liberal use of
profane language doesn't seem at all shocking in this context and
her comic insights are delightfully affirming, a celebration of
difference that skewers stereotypes of all kinds. Her act has
earned her a loyal gay following (``Fag hags are the backbone of
the gay community!'' she deadpans to her appreciative San Francisco
audience) but her humor is universal. ``I'm the One That I Want''
is the funniest thing I've seen this summer.
</P>
<P>
   I'm the One That I Want. Directed by Lionel Coleman. Written by
Margaret Cho. Cast: Cho. Cho Taussig Productions. 96 minutes. No
rating, contains offensive language.

`KID' PLAYS TO THE HEART BUT THE TUNE IS A TIRED ONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 Our Grade: C-  
 By SEAN AXMAKER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the summer of 1999, Bruce Willis played on the softer side of
his persona for a story about love, loss and acceptance. ``The
Sixth Sense'' came out of nowhere and both thrilled and moved
audiences used to slam-bang action and funhouse horror roller
coasters, and Willis delivered one of the quietest performances of
his career.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect a return engagement in 2000. Willis retunes the
heartstrings for Walt Disney's ``The Kid,'' a cloying family comedy
as distinctive as a TV movie, but this time he's off-key.
</P>
<P>
   He plays a boorish workaholic image consultant who gives his
advice with a sarcastic sneer. Willis does such a good job playing
an arrogant, insolent jerk that he's instantly unlikable, only
barely funny, and hardly worth saving.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow he has earned the loyalty of a small but faithful staff.
Sardonic secretary Lily Tomlin puts up with his mercenary nature
with a steady stream of retorts, and his perky assistant Emily
Mortimer (``Love's Labour's Lost''), a smart little British cookie,
keeps the idea of romance alive for no apparent reason.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's another chapter in Hollywood's unending saga, ``Smart,
sensitive women who stay with complete jerks hoping they'll
change.'' This being Hollywood, he does.
</P>
<P>
   A time warp twist on ``A Christmas Carol'' delivers Willis his
own Jacob Marley: a nerdish, clumsy kid with unlimited affection
who turns out to be himself at age 8. Spencer Breslin, who plays
the kid, is reminiscent of Charlie Talbert from ``Angus,'' a
fumbling but well-meaning adolescent just trying to find his way in
the world with all the dignity he can muster, but all Willis can
see is the echo of a miserable childhood he's drummed out of his
memory.
</P>
<P>
   Will he succeed in turning his mini-me into a hardened, no-fun
workaholic, or will the little guy melt the big guy's heart and
heal his emotional scars?
</P>
<P>
   Willis can do this part in his sleep and at times he does,
falling back on familiar smirking retorts and lazy saccharine
versions of soulful sincerity. To be fair, he's not given much help
by Audrey Wells' (``The Truth About Cats and Dogs'') utterly bland
script or Jon Turteltaub's (``Instinct,'' ``Phenomenon'') vague,
generic direction, which manufactures its sense of wonder with
orchestral flourishes and swooping camerawork.
</P>
<P>
   The time-travel fantasy is the least of their worries: Willis
and Breslin are stuck in a charmless, predictable picture they
can't escape.
</P>
<P>
   The Kid. Directed by Jon Turteltaub. Written by Audrey Wells.
Cast: Bruce Willis, Spencer Breslin, Emily Mortimer, Lily Tomlin,
Chi McBride, Jean Smart. Walt Disney Pictures. 101 minutes. Rated
PG for mild language.

`DISNEY'S THE KID': A CRUEL, SELF-ABSORBED ADULT LEARNS ABOUT
LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes at end of review) 
 By A.O. SCOTT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most theoretical physicists agree that time travel is
impossible. If you could go back to the past, they reason, you
could alter the present in ways that flout all the rules of the
universe by killing your father, falling in love with your mother,
stepping on a butterfly. For the same reasons, science fiction
writers and Hollywood filmmakers have found the notion irresistible
as a source of terror (the ``Terminator'' movies, ``12 Monkeys'')
or comfort (``Back to the Future,'' three times).
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney's `The Kid''' _ this is the official title, presumably
to avoid confusion by time-travelers with fond memories of the
Charlie Chaplin silent with the same name _ presents temporal
dislocation as something so innocuous it doesn't need to be
explained. No mad scientists or malevolent robots, no bluff
pseudoscience about alpha waves or the space-time continuum, just a
red prop plane zooming around Los Angeles, rearranging the laws of
probability for one Russ Durwitz, a churlish egoist crisply played
by Bruce Willis.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in as many years, Willis stands by while a
child swipes a movie out of his open palm, and for the second time
he plays _ this time for only a few climactic moments _ a child's
invisible friend. This time the child, played by Spencer Breslin,
is Russ' tubby, cute-but-annoying almost-8-year-old self, who has
been dispatched from 1968, by means of an arrangement involving the
aforesaid plane and a chimerical diner, to teach the adult Russ
some important lessons about life, love and growing up.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's that kind of movie. The adult Russ works as ``an image
consultant'' for an assortment of morally repellent businessmen and
politicians and one lovable African-American athlete (Chi McBride;
similar to the character played by Cuba Gooding Jr. in ``Jerry
Maguire,'' a movie whose basic narrative arc is shared by ``The
Kid''). ``Somebody call the waah-mbulance,'' is Russ' mocking
refrain whenever one of his clients sheds a tear. A more shameless
hour and a half of waahmbulance chasing you haven't seen since _
well, since ``Frequency,'' the year's other big time-warp macho
hankiefest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kid,'' directed by Jon Turtletaub, who also did
``Phenomenon,'' floats its pathos on tame, family-friendly comedy.
In spirit, it's like a slightly less madcap rendering of one of
those Disney live-action matinee staples of another era _ ``The
Shaggy Dog,'' say, or ``Son of Flubber.'' But while those movies
affectionately spoofed (and always upheld) a midcentury,
father-knows-best view of family life, ``The Kid'' embraces
turn-of-the-century self-help ideology in a crushingly sincere
masculine bearhug. Russ' problem is that he's a hopeless
narcissist. The solution? More narcissism! Just what every shallow,
overprivileged 40-year-old bachelor needs: Another self to love.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a cruel, obsessive, self-absorbed man, who, in learning
the error of his ways, also learns that nothing is his fault. He
was a fat, unhappy kid, tormented by bullies and scarred by a
repressed family trauma, and all he has to do _ get in your time
machine, Dr. Freud _ is return to the scene of the trauma and, how
to say, process it. In the meantime he is nurtured and coddled by
three women (not counting his therapist) who have nothing better to
do than indulge his whims and wait around until he learns to be
nice to them.
</P>
<P>
   The charming Emily Mortimer is the co-worker Russ is secretly in
love with; Jean Smart is a television anchorwoman he is mean to on
an airplane; and Lily Tomlin _ Lily Tomlin! _ is his patient,
put-upon assistant. All of them see the kid in Russ and quickly
catch on that his pint-size companion is really a mini-him, in
spite of the fact that, in an astonishing casting oversight, the
boy's eyes are blue and Willis' are light brown. (This is not the
only instance of sloppiness: After their first meeting, Russ jumps
into his Porsche and chases the boy through traffic-clogged
streets. It's supposed to be 3 in the morning, which is apparently
rush hour in Russ' sparsely populated stretch of the Hollywood
Hills.)
</P>
<P>
   By rights ``The Kid'' should be dreadful. Surprisingly enough,
it often soars to heights of not bad. The script is by Audrey
Wells, who wrote ``The Truth About Cats and Dogs'' as well as
``Guinevere'' (which she also directed); she has a way of being
smarter than the projects she works on. Scene by scene and line by
line, ``The Kid'' has a pleasant, unforced air, aided by the
professionalism of the actors. Smart gives another brief, glowing
performance in a mediocre movie, and Willis earns his paycheck with
some fine smirks, a couple of dandy tantrums and even a few
discreet tears. Young Spencer Breslin acquits himself well, though
it is hard to picture him _ eye color notwithstanding _ growing up
into Bruce Willis. And when he delivers his judgment on the man he
will become _ ``I grow up to be a loser'' _ you know that nobody
watching the movie or involved in making it believes him for a
second.

<P>
   Shopping on the Internet. People talk about it, but are they
really doing it? Or are these shoppers like Internet millionaires _
people we've heard about but don't really know.
</P>
<P>
   We recently asked groups of teens and twentysomethings if _ and
where _ they were shopping. Most tend to browse rather than buy,
others browse and then head to the old brick-and-mortar for the
deal, but a few revealed some of their favorite sites for shopping.
And while we can't guarantee the sites will last forever (little
does on the Web), here's a good start if you're up at 2 a.m. and
desperate to spend.
</P>
<P>
   REFLECT.COM
</P>
<P>
   One of the things our respondents claim to like the most about
the Internet is its ability to allow them to customize products to
feel more special. Reflect.com lets surfers select ingredients to
make shampoos, cleansers and other body products. On top of that,
they can name the product after themselves _ or someone else.
That's one way to make sure that your medicine chest is unique!
</P>
<P>
   PURPLESKIRT.COM
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has watched Tracey Ullman's comedy routines might
question her fashion sense. But clearly she was acting. This
somewhat limited site offers some of the coolest fashion trends at
reasonable prices. The picks tend to be on the cutting edge,
offering even the funniest fashionista a chance to upgrade her
look.
</P>
<P>
   THEHOMEBISTRO.COM
</P>
<P>
   We've been hearing a great deal about the trend toward cooking
at home. Xers who grew up on microwave feasts and fast food are
returning to the kitchen in droves. The one catch _ they don't know
how to cook! And while some are content to learn as they go, others
are looking for short cuts. Enter Thehomebistro.com. This site
offers pre-prepared meals, with ingredients, cut, measured and
bagged so that the recipient has only to follow some simple
directions and whip up a masterpiece. Thehomebistro.com also allows
you to select the number of portions, avoiding that ever-present
fear of running out, or (even worse), having leftovers that last a
week.
</P>
<P>
   CNET.COM
</P>
<P>
   According to our respondents, the Web can be just that _ a maze
of choices that snag and snare. When it comes to electronics at
least, Cnet.com untangles the mess. This site provides its own _
and customers' _ ratings on electronics, comparing at least 10
stores on price, availability and shipping. While it won't
guarantee that you'll know how to use what you purchase, at least
you'll feel like a smart shopper.
</P>
<P>
   NETAPORTER.COM
</P>
<P>
   Did we say shop? We meant lust. This site is one of the most
fashion-forward sites around, with high-end brands like Jimmy Choo,
Vanessa Bruno and Anya Hindmarch. In addition, netaporter.com,
which is headquartered in London, assembles some of the hottest
European brands. What makes this site so appealing is its magazine
approach. Photos feature put-together outfits that entice the
viewer to click further. Be warned, though, prices are in British
pounds, so you might want to visit oanda.com first to exchange
currency.
</P>
<P>
   CAROLINESCLOSET.COM
</P>
<P>
   For our respondents who love the look of vintage clothing but
hate sorting through the remnant bins, this site offers some of the
coolest classics around. From Pucci to Pulitzer, Sergio Valente to
sneakers from the 1970s, this site has all the stuff you wish you
hadn't let your mother throw out. Each piece is rated, reasonably
priced and ready to take you back.
</P>
<P>
   ALLOY.COM
</P>
<P>
   What started as a teen catalog has morphed into a teen community
center. But what smart shoppers have discovered is the site's
auction area where everything from beanie babies to action figures
to hard-to-get Pokemon cards can be found. Alloy.com feels like a
less intimidating E-bay, where you won't get carried away with the
bidding.
</P>
<P>
   LUXURYFINDER.COM
</P>
<P>
   This site should be used only in emergencies _ like when you
forgot your dad's 60th or your partner's passing the bar. This
amalgamation of high-end products assembles the best of the best.
From Porthault sheets to more moderately priced Frederic Fekkai
hair-care products, you'll know you're buying the top of the line.
And for those pesky times when you find yourself in immediate need
of your own personal jet, look no further.
</P>
<P>
   SHOPASSURED.COM
</P>
<P>
   Before you shop anywhere, check out this site that warns you
when you've entered a site with a bad reputation. It's a free
plug-in; it won't have info on every site, but since the Web will
be won by word of mouth, this is a resource you should take the
time to install.

Times mutual fund report for the first half of 2000. All will move
for release Sunday, July 9, 2000. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-FLOW (Undated) _ If technology remains the obsession of
American investors, where are money managers placing their bets
now? The answers can have all the longevity of a cast member on
``Survivor.'' To trace the path of new-economy investing, fast feet
and a good line of technospeak are required. By Danny Hakim.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-PERFORMANCE (Undated) _ In the long-running debate
between managers of funds that search for cheap stocks and those
that chase the fastest-growing companies, neither was an exultant
winner. The growth funds that had dominated for most of the long
bull market for stocks flamed out, but their value-seeking
counterparts did not exactly soar from their ash piles. An
interest-bearing checking account turned out to be a better place
to stash cash than either broad category of stock fund. By Patrick
McGeehan.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-INTERNATIONAL (Undated) _ Investors who thought they
could lessen their risk by diversifying overseas found little
solace last quarter in international equity funds, many of which
underperformed their domestic counterparts. By Vivian Marino.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-STRATEGIES (Undated) _ On behalf of financial planners,
academics, investment advisers and self-anointed experts
everywhere, I apologize. It appears that much of what you have been
told over the last 30 years about the benefits of international
diversification has been greatly exaggerated. In fact, according to
a new study, those benefits are less than half as great as
originally thought. By Mark Hulbert.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-ESSAY (Undated) _ Commentary: If you are like me, all
these fund family crests leave you cold. Granted, illustrating
something so fuzzy as an investment philosophy is no easy feat but
can't we do any better than a bunch of polygons, sailing vessels
and oak trees? By Patrick McGeehan.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-BONDS (Undated) _ Do not be put off by how eye-glazingly
abstruse the subject sounds: A bill making its way through Congress
to change how government-sponsored agencies like Freddie Mac and
Fannie Mae are regulated could, if enacted, have some profound
effects on the portfolios of millions of ordinary investors. By
Abby Schultz.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-INVESTORS (Undated) _ Meet the managed account, which
many people view as the latest threat to the 75-year-old mutual
fund industry. It used to be that only a privileged few could
afford their own money manager, but in the last few years assets in
privately managed accounts have swelled. Credit, in part, a bull
market that has more than doubled the number of millionaire
households since 1983, to five million. By Danny Hakim.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-JUNKBONDS (Undated) _ Remember junk bonds? It was the
play stuff of Michael Milken, mother's milk of the 1980s
leveraged-buyout craze and eventually a symbol of that decade's
decadence. In recent quarters, junk bonds have logged some of their
worst performance in almost a decade. By Kate Berry.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-MUNIS (Undated) _ For fixed-income investors, there
appears to be a lucrative silver lining in the cloud of rising
interest rates: buying opportunities among closed-end municipal
bond funds. By Carole Gould.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-RETIRE (Undated) _ Because saving for retirement had
become a crucial issue for Americans, The New York Times in 1993
asked five mutual-fund experts how they would invest a hypothetical
nest egg of $50,000 for someone who planned to retire in 20 years
or more. Each quarter since then, the five portfolios have been
reviewed and fine-tuned and their performances compared in these
pages. With results from the second quarter of 2000, the exercise
concludes, and the participants discuss what they, and investors,
have learned along the way. By Carole Gould.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-MANAGERS (Undated) _ There were swoons and rebounds, and
then more again of the same. But by the end of the second quarter,
the stock market had provided enough bad news to push every major
category of United States diversified equity funds into negative
territory for the period. Over all, domestic diversified stock
funds lost 4.3 percent. What funds managed to shine as stormy
weather lashed the markets? Generally, the winners owned shares in
companies in old-economy sectors, like oil and gas, as well as in
health care and some financial services. Managers of three
top-performing funds talked about the resurgence of
once-beaten-down sectors and what they expect from the stock market
during the remainder of the year. By Carole Gould.

</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T-FUTURE (Undated) _ On May 2, AT&AMP;T dropped its bomb on the
company's investors. AT&AMP;T said its operations would grow more
slowly and earn less this year than the company had previously led
investors to expect. The company's shares, which had closed that
Monday at $49, lost $7.0625, shaving more than $25 billion from
AT&AMP;T's market value. And the shares did not bounce back. They lost
more value the next day. And the day after that. And the day after
that. The pain continues. By Seth Schiesel.
</P>
<P>
   With photo and graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SHOE-SALES (Undated) _ Despite the boom in consumer spending,
shoe sales have grown at a minuscule 1.8 percent a year for the
last decade, according to Footwear Marketing Insights, the
Nashville-based industry research arm. That is in keeping with
historical growth, but disappointing compared to the 1980s, when
fueled by the athletic craze, shoe consumption jumped about 6
percent a year. By Leslie Kaufman.

Rodgin Cohen has been a sought-after counselor to chief executives

adviser on some of this era's largest mergers. By Laura M. Holson.
</P>
<P>
   LOCKHEED-HIGHTECH (Moorestown, N.J.) _ The locals call it ``the
cruiser in the cornfield.'' What looks like the top half of a Navy
vessel is actually a lab where the Lockheed Martin Corp. tests its
ability to knit together naval communications gear, sensors, radar,
and controls used to fire weapons. By Stan Crock.

   GAS-TAX-DEDUCTION (Undated) _ High gas prices at the pump,
despite recent agreements to increase oil production, will surely
add to the political debate. They may also change the calculus on
another question: whether people who rack up business mileage
should use the standard rate or the actual-expense method when
calculating tax deductions. By Stacy Kravetz.

test-drive three new automobiles, rolled out late last month amid a

Detroit. Yet these vehicles are unavailable in dealer showrooms,

NINTENDO STILL GOING STRONG
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hard to believe, but at the rate things are going, Nintendo may
start challenging McDonald's for most served. The company recently
passed the 100 million mark in the number of Game Boy handheld
systems sold since the device debuted in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   At around $70 apiece, that's $7 billion in sales before a single
game cartridge or add-on accessory is sold. And with more Pokemon
Game Boy titles coming among the scores of new games expected from
dozens of developers, there's little reason to think the machines
will stop succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, Nintendo has shrugged off one seemingly attractive
challenger, SNK's NeoGeo Pocket Color (available at www.snk.com),
which has struggled to attract any consumer interest 13 months
after its debut.
</P>
<P>
   Game Boy may face stiffer competition, at least in the long
term, from the Palm- and Pocket PC-based handheld organizers that
are proving big hits in the marketplace (Father's Day found Palm
device makers unable to keep up with demand, for instance). Go to
www.palm.com, www.handspring.com and the sites of PC and
electronics makers such as Compaq, Hewlett-Packard and Casio for
more information on any of these.
</P>
<P>
   Games are becoming a good-sized sector in the software offerings
for these machines, but their prices are far beyond the $70 or so
it costs for a Game Boy Color. Think of it as the difference
between playing games on a PC versus a console like the N64 or
PlayStation; one is a relatively complex and costly machine that
does a lot of different things while the other is simple, cheap and
does a few things well.
</P>
<P>
   A just-debuted, teen-oriented challenger, the Cybiko (at
www.cybiko.com), may prove to be a worthy opponent, particularly
because it offers delightfully simple wireless networking that lets
kids play each other or chat as long as they're within 300 feet of
each other.
</P>
<P>
   I've tested the machines and found they connect simply and
reliably with each other and provide simple ways to do a lot of
things teens in particular will think are cool, like matching up
people with similar interests and finding gaming opponents.
</P>
<P>
   It has a built-in organizer and other capabilities (much as does
the NeoGeo) and comes with an artificial life game, CyLandia. It
also links to your computer for easy updates and backups, and
Cybiko provides a free e- mail account through its Website.
</P>
<P>
   As a further enticement, Cybiko's parent company gives away a
free, downloadable game from the Internet every day to take
advantage of that power. It's a bit pricey, at $129, and the
monochrome screen is definitely behind the technology curve, but in
all, it's a fine package that holds a lot of promise.
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo's response to these challengers won't come until next
year probably, when it finally releases the Game Boy Advance, which
will jump to a far more powerful 32-bit brain (the current
processor is only 8 bits). The company has talked about providing
wireless Web connections, cell-phone capabilities and more through
the Advance.
</P>
<P>
   And interestingly, a 32-bit brain would put the Advance at the
same power level, more or less, as the original PlayStation, in a
compact, handheld box.
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo's latest word is that the Advance will debut in Japan
by year's end, but company officials have largely been mum about
details for the American market. With the Game Boy selling 17.5
million units last year alone, the company is in no hurry to put
its cash cow out to pasture.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the original PlayStation will be getting a facelift
(and serious liposuction) after its powerful successor, the
PlayStation 2, hits American markets in October.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent Japan press conference, Sony officials unveiled the
PS One, which has all the connections and capabilities of the
original PlayStation, in a package about a third the size.
</P>
<P>
   The machine is designed for mobile uses such as in the car, and
will eventually have available add-ons such as a cell phone link
for Internet gaming and a clip-on LCD screen.
</P>
<P>
   Those attachments are many months away, but Sony finally is
beginning to do the same marketing-minded variations on a theme for
the PlayStation that they've applied with such verve and success on
all their consumer electronics products (think 200 kinds of Walkman
as interpreted on the old gray PlayStation box).

NINTENDO STILL GOING STRONG
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hard to believe, but at the rate things are going, Nintendo may
start challenging McDonald's for most served. The company recently
passed the 100 million mark in the number of Game Boy handheld
systems sold since the device debuted in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   At around $70 apiece, that's $7 billion in sales before a single
game cartridge or add-on accessory is sold. And with more Pokemon
Game Boy titles coming among the scores of new games expected from
dozens of developers, there's little reason to think the machines
will stop succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, Nintendo has shrugged off one seemingly attractive
challenger, SNK's NeoGeo Pocket Color (available at www.snk.com),
which has struggled to attract any consumer interest 13 months
after its debut.
</P>
<P>
   Game Boy may face stiffer competition, at least in the long
term, from the Palm- and Pocket PC-based handheld organizers that
are proving big hits in the marketplace (Father's Day found Palm
device makers unable to keep up with demand, for instance). Go to
www.palm.com, www.handspring.com and the sites of PC and
electronics makers such as Compaq, Hewlett-Packard and Casio for
more information on any of these.
</P>
<P>
   Games are becoming a good-sized sector in the software offerings
for these machines, but their prices are far beyond the $70 or so
it costs for a Game Boy Color. Think of it as the difference
between playing games on a PC versus a console like the N64 or
PlayStation; one is a relatively complex and costly machine that
does a lot of different things while the other is simple, cheap and
does a few things well.
</P>
<P>
   A just-debuted, teen-oriented challenger, the Cybiko (at
www.cybiko.com), may prove to be a worthy opponent, particularly
because it offers delightfully simple wireless networking that lets
kids play each other or chat as long as they're within 300 feet of
each other.
</P>
<P>
   I've tested the machines and found they connect simply and
reliably with each other and provide simple ways to do a lot of
things teens in particular will think are cool, like matching up
people with similar interests and finding gaming opponents.
</P>
<P>
   It has a built-in organizer and other capabilities (much as does
the NeoGeo) and comes with an artificial life game, CyLandia. It
also links to your computer for easy updates and backups, and
Cybiko provides a free e- mail account through its Website.
</P>
<P>
   As a further enticement, Cybiko's parent company gives away a
free, downloadable game from the Internet every day to take
advantage of that power. It's a bit pricey, at $129, and the
monochrome screen is definitely behind the technology curve, but in
all, it's a fine package that holds a lot of promise.
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo's response to these challengers won't come until next
year probably, when it finally releases the Game Boy Advance, which
will jump to a far more powerful 32-bit brain (the current
processor is only 8 bits). The company has talked about providing
wireless Web connections, cell-phone capabilities and more through
the Advance.
</P>
<P>
   And interestingly, a 32-bit brain would put the Advance at the
same power level, more or less, as the original PlayStation, in a
compact, handheld box.
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo's latest word is that the Advance will debut in Japan
by year's end, but company officials have largely been mum about
details for the American market. With the Game Boy selling 17.5
million units last year alone, the company is in no hurry to put
its cash cow out to pasture.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the original PlayStation will be getting a facelift
(and serious liposuction) after its powerful successor, the
PlayStation 2, hits American markets in October.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent Japan press conference, Sony officials unveiled the
PS One, which has all the connections and capabilities of the
original PlayStation, in a package about a third the size.
</P>
<P>
   The machine is designed for mobile uses such as in the car, and
will eventually have available add-ons such as a cell phone link
for Internet gaming and a clip-on LCD screen.
</P>
<P>
   Those attachments are many months away, but Sony finally is
beginning to do the same marketing-minded variations on a theme for
the PlayStation that they've applied with such verve and success on
all their consumer electronics products (think 200 kinds of Walkman
as interpreted on the old gray PlayStation box).

COLORADO BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT SCHOOLS DISPLAY `IN GOD WE TRUST' 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Asserting that public schools have a duty to teach
moral rectitude, the Colorado State Board of Education on Thursday
passed a resolution that encourages schools to display the national
motto, ``In God we trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the measure passed with five Republicans on the board
voting in favor and the lone Democrat dissenting, supporters
insisted that the motto reflects a founding principle of the
country, not any religion, and, therefore, does not blur the
constitutional line separating church and state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nation has lost its way on the road to virtue and moral
character,'' said Clair Orr, the board chairman and sponsor of the
resolution, who characterized the motto as no less sacred than
words he quoted from the Declaration of Independence, Lincoln's
Gettysburg Address and the pledge to the flag. ``We have a moral
obligation to educate our children in the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   As the only opponent to the resolution, Gully Stanford, said he
agreed with the majority's view that ``In God we trust,''
introduced on currency in 1864 and made the national motto in 1956,
conveys the vision of a country founded on Judeo-Christian values.
</P>
<P>
   But in an increasingly diverse society that includes followers
of other religions, as well as nonbelievers, he said the resolution
is insensitive, divisive, distracting and ill-timed in light of the
recent Supreme Court decision that affirmed the unconstitutional
nature of student-led prayers at high school football games..
</P>
<P>
   The resolution may not be intended as ideological, he told his
colleagues, ``but it will be interpreted that way at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford also said that the values embraced by the national
motto, religious or otherwise, can be taught just as effectively
and more appropriately in history and civics classes.
</P>
<P>
   The board heard no public comments before the vote. Lynn M.
Fontanier, a spokeswoman for the board, said the public had several
months to submit comments and only two opponents emerged. She said
the board received arguments against the measure from Robert R.
Tiernan, a Denver lawyer who has been involved in several federal
lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the motto's use on
currency, and the Mountain States chapter of the Anti-Defamation
League of B'nai B'rith, which characterized the resolution as
unconstitutional, insensitive and exclusionary.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Armstrong, executive director of the Denver office of the
American Civil Liberties Union, who attended Thursday's meeting,
said she had been unaware that the board had scheduled a period for
public comment. Speaking to reporters after the vote, she echoed
many of Stanford's concerns and questioned the constitutionality of
the measure, saying, ``Each argument they made was a religious
argument that reflected a strong religious bias.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for
Separation of Church and State, a Washington-based organization,
agreed, accusing the board of ``trying to meddle in the religious
lives of young children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have no business doing that and should, in fact, just
butt out,'' he said in a statement.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: `BIG BROTHER' PROFFERS HOURS OF GUILT-FREE
SNOOPING
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: CBS-BIG-BROTHER, being filed in category ``f'')  
 By JULIE SALAMON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I was in college my boyfriend and I were baby-sitting for a
neighbor and had just put the children to bed. We were both
reporters for the campus newspaper and somehow decided our right to
know extended to the private papers on the desk of the people who
had trusted us to watch their children.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes we hit pay dirt: a letter from the husband to his
wife, confessing adultery after she had found incriminating hotel
bills.
</P>
<P>
   But our successful snooping didn't feel rewarding or even
titillating. Instead we felt ashamed. We tried to arrange the
papers exactly as we'd found them and hoped our employers didn't
see the guilty look in our eyes as we rushed out the door at the
evening's end.
</P>
<P>
   That's the seamy beauty of CBS's ``Big Brother'': voyeurism
without guilt. We've all been invited to peep at 10 people who have
volunteered to live together nonstop for three months, under
constant surveillance by 28 cameras and 60 microphones. Not only
must they endure one another, they must live without many creature
comforts (dishwashers, clothes dryers) and without contact with the
outside world (no computers, television, telephone or newspapers).
They can swim in the backyard pool, grow vegetables in the garden
and gather eggs from their CBS-supplied chickens.
</P>
<P>
   Already a hit in Europe, ``Big Brother'' originally was
scheduled to begin Thursday night. But CBS advanced the premiere
one day to take advantage of the popularity of its other
``reality'' show, ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor,'' however, is shown only one night a week. We can
watch people in the ``Big Brother'' house constantly: five nights a
week on television, in both live and taped broadcasts, and nonstop
on the Internet. But the producers have assured viewers in advance
that the bathroom camera will not be part of the live broadcast, to
prevent reoccurrence of an embarrassing moment in the Netherlands
version.
</P>
<P>
   We can even participate. Every two weeks the home audience votes
(by telephone) to evict one of the residents and ultimately
determines which of three finalists wins the $500,000 grand prize.
</P>
<P>
   Is this the end of civilization as we know it?
</P>
<P>
   Hard to tell from the Wednesday night one-hour premiere, which
was a giant tease. The contestants spent most of the hour traveling
on the streets of Los Angeles in a caravan of identical white SUVs,
conjuring a memory of O.J. Simpson's Bronco. While waiting for
their arrival at the house, the hostess-anchor, Julie Chen,
explained and exclaimed with relentless enthusiasm. (Chen is a
newscaster on ``The Early Show''; her credibility may never recover
from this.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The show has already rocked several countries in Europe,'' she
hyperbolized. Then she presented a montage of video clips from the
European editions. Judging from these, here's what we have to look
forward to: conga lines, deodorant spritzing, leg shaving,
smooching, fighting, more smooching, pillow fighting, X-rated
smooching (under wiggling comforters).
</P>
<P>
   While waiting for the caravan to arrive, Chen introduced the
contestants, who appear in brief taped biographies, with commentary
from friends and family. Her co-host, Ian O'Malley, gave a tour of
the house and its hidden cameras. While Chen seemed ready to pop
through the screen with excitement, he'd barely shaken himself
awake.
</P>
<P>
   But neither host is nearly as odd as the people who have
volunteered to lock themselves in the house for national
exhibition. There's Jamie, crowned Miss Washington, USA, (described
as ``a beauty queen with a 4.0 average''), who declares that she
was sorry to miss ``community service and things like that.'' If
there were a choice, however, between relinquishing her crown and
participating in ``Big Brother,'' she says, the title would just
have to go.
</P>
<P>
   From the Midwest comes George, seen posing in the snow in boxer
shorts and nothing else. He says that if America can get a thrill
at looking at an overweight, hairy guy walking around in his
underwear, ``have at it!''
</P>
<P>
   One young man lost his leg to cancer as a child; another lost
his mother. A buff-looking woman competes in triathlons and is
writing a book, but she earns her living as an exotic dancer. As in
``Survivor,'' one contestant is pierced: this one in the nose
rather than the nipple. She lets us know that she's a virgin.
</P>
<P>
   A mother of four says she needs a break from her kids. Hasn't
she heard of a spa?
</P>
<P>
   Finally the contestants arrived. The annoying Chen herded them
to the front of the house, through a cheering gaggle of friends and
family. As the ``Big Brother'' group awkwardly kissed loved ones so
long and blinked at the lights, it became apparent that this show
will be tackier and creepier than ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the night I peeked at the contestants on the
Internet, at bigbrother2000.com, to see if any comforters were
rustling suspiciously. After a half-hour, I was rewarded only by a
shift in position by one of the men. It's just the beginning, but
so far there's more Web action on www.stinkymeat.net, the Web site
that follows the decomposition of various meat products, day by
day.
</P>
<P>
   This bizarre gimmick illustrates yet again how desperate the
networks are for ratings. It's a brave new world in television
land, because even couch potatoes can summon the energy to click
through dozens of channels.
</P>
<P>
   How big is ``Survivor's'' much-vaunted success? Preliminary
ratings show that ``Survivor'' was watched in about 15.1 million of
the country's 100.8 million television households this week. On its
first night ``Big Brother'' was seen in about 13.9 million
households. Compare those numbers with the highest-rated episode of
the ABC miniseries ``Roots,'' also a special event, which in those
network-dominated days of January 1977 was seen in 36.4 million of
the 71.2 million television households, more than half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother'' continues a CBS tradition. A half-century ago,
on ``Truth or Consequences,'' another CBS game show, the host,
Ralph Edwards, brought onstage the mother of a (real) soldier
stationed in Korea. They chatted, and then she was taken offstage,
while Edwards prepared a surprise for her.
</P>
<P>
   This is how the critic Jack Gould reported the event in The New
York Times:
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Edwards, with an air of triumph, brought out Mrs.
Cunningham to see her boy, upon whom she had not laid eyes for 31
months. Across her face in a flash there came that heart-rending
combination of anguish and relief any woman would show upon seeing
a son or husband returned from war. It was an intensely private,
personal moment, which no outsider had the right to share. The
sensitive viewer could not help but be embarrassed and ashamed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the sensitive viewer. Does he exist anymore? Did she ever?

`ROADS': A LONESOME DRIVER ON THAT ANONYMOUS RIBBON 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bittersweet scent of loss has always wafted through Larry
McMurtry's fiction, creating a mood of wistful melancholy. Whether
writing about the waning of the Old West in ``Lonesome Dove'' and
``Streets of Laredo'' or simply chronicling an aging woman's
reminiscences and regrets in ``The Evening Star,'' he has always
been acutely attuned to the wages of time and change. His latest
book, ``Roads,'' is no exception. Though the volume is simply an
account of his desultory travels through the United States, it
leaves the reader with a haunting sense of how the country has
changed in the last half-century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roads'' traces a series of drives that McMurtry took in his
spare time along America's great interstates: from Baltimore to
Burlington, Colo., on I-70; from Los Angeles to Albuquerque on the
10, the 15 and the 40; from Washington to Dallas via the 66, 81, 40
and the 30, and so on, from East to West, from North to South.
</P>
<P>
   The trips were made with no real destination in mind: the routes
chosen by whim, the direction by impulse and intuition. McMurtry's
one aim, it seems, was to avoid traffic congestion, roads under
repair and heavily traveled truck routes while also renouncing the
sort of small picturesque roads that William Least Heat Moon
traversed in his 1983 book ``Blue Highways.'' As a result ``Roads''
has a decidedly improvisatory air: It lacks the obsessive quality
that McMurtry himself says distinguishes the best travel writing,
and it often suffers, like ``Flim Flam,'' his 1987 book on
Hollywood, from a curiously perfunctory tone.
</P>
<P>
   In his restless drive to keep moving, McMurtry often passes by
the oddest, most interesting sights. He toys with stopping at a
roadside attraction that features a 500-pound man-killing clam but
when he notices that the site is closed he makes no effort to
return. He similarly bypasses the famed Meteor Crater in Arizona
because he doesn't want to contend with the traffic. As for his
views on the shortcomings of Texas cities like Austin and San
Antonio, he simply refers the reader to one of his earlier books.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Roads'' is not without its modest pleasures: It's like
a long, meandering road trip with an affable raconteur who likes to
comment on the landscape glimpsed through the windshield while
reminiscing about earlier visits to the region and books he once
read. Visits to northern Michigan and Key West, Fla., of course,
elicit riffs on Hemingway while Mississippi evokes memories of
books by Faulkner and Eudora Welty. Works by lesser-known writers
are cited as well, most notably ``We Pointed Them North'' by Teddy
Blue and Helena Huntington Smith, a book McMurtry hails as ``the
single best memoir of the cowboy era.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to writing novels, McMurtry has long had a second
career as an antiquarian bookman, and that job has taken him over
the years to remote corners of the country. This volume attests to
his easy familiarity with a plethora of regions and roads _ the
sort of familiarity that has helped him lend the sprawling country
the intimate feel of a small town in novels like ``Buffalo Girls.''
</P>
<P>
   He remembers the days in West Virginia before the interstate
highways were built, when he ``crawled painfully across the state,
usually on mountain roads that offered no opportunities to pass the
many under-powered coal trucks that would be groaning up the hills
at two or three miles an hour, in their lowest gear.'' And he
remembers commuting between his two homes in Washington and Archer
City, Texas, a route he has driven some 60 times, ``enough to have
acquainted myself with virtually every gas station and convenience
store along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Driving that route today, he observes, ``it occurs to me that my
effort was obliquely Proustian, a retracing of my past that is
analogous to the many rereadings I've done in the last few years''
of favorite books. After heart surgery left him feeling alienated
and ghostly, it was a way to reconnect with his former self, to
reacquaint himself with ``elements of my old personality that are
still unaccounted for.''
</P>
<P>
   In this volume, however, McMurtry does not dwell on his own
feelings but focuses rather on the changes in America he observes
as he retraces favorite roads. He notes the proliferation of
casinos and outlet malls across the country and comments on the
arrival of ``nouveau ranchers'' in Texas who decorate the entrances
to their spreads with statuary modeled on the Arc de Triomphe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The development of credit-card gas pumps, microwaves, and
express motels has eliminated the necessity for human contact along
the interstates,'' he writes. ``It is now possible to drive coast
to coast without speaking to a human being at all: you just slide
your card, pump your gas, buy a couple of Hershey bars, perhaps
heat up a burrito, and put the pedal back to the metal.'' The most
eloquent chapter in this slender book deals with McMurtry's
memories of the ranch he grew up on in Texas, and the small,
unnamed roads he traversed as a boy _ on horseback, by mule cart
and later by truck. McMurtry recalls the waning days of the trail
drive (soon to be replaced by the advent of big cattle trucks) and
the squabbling produced by the county's decision, in the centennial
year of 1980, to name some local roads in honor of prominent
pioneer families. Some residents who did not like the name given to
the road past their homes just cut down the sign, he recalls;
``some roads had to be named two or three times before the citizens
who lived along them'' felt that ``the committee of road namers had
finally got it right.''
</P>
<P>
   In this chapter the hasty travel chat of the book's earlier
portions gives way to something deeper and more moving. The reader
only wishes that McMurtry had spent more time in this volume on the
dirt roads of his youth than on the impersonal interstates of
today.

 &HT;    PROTESTERS SAY THEY'LL BE ACTIVE OUTSIDE POLITICAL CONVENTIONS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Promising a pox on both political parties, an array
of activists warned Thursday that they will take over the streets
outside the Republican and Democratic national conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had enough,'' said Margaret Prescod, a leader of the
R2D2K Coalition of protest groups. ``Get ready for a democratic
intervention on both coasts of the United States this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   The movement includes many of the anti-globalist militants who
disrupted the World Trade Organization conference in Seattle and
besieged the World Bank meetings in Washington this year.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference, they outlined plans for similar actions
when the Republicans meet in Philadelphia from July 31 to Aug. 4
and when the Democrats convene in Los Angeles from Aug. 14-18.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for a change,'' said Lisa Fithian, who wore a ``Shut
It Down'' T-shirt from the Direct Action Network. ``In Philadelphia
and Los Angeles, we say, 'No more business as usual.' ``
</P>
<P>
   The organizers said both major parties are controlled by
multinational corporate interests, and neither is accountable to
poor and working people. While representing causes varying from
labor unions to homeless mothers, they said they were unified in
demanding a political system ``based on human need, and not on
corporate greed.''
</P>
<P>
   The organizers predicted tens of thousands of activists will
take part in demonstrations ranging from marches to street theater.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, where the Republicans will nominate Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas for president, poor people will camp out in a
``Bushville'' modeled after the ``Hoovervilles'' of the Great
Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Convention Center in Los Angeles, thousands of
people will bang on drums, paint buckets, pots and pans during Vice
President Al Gore's acceptance speech for the Democratic
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to take to the streets because they still belong
to us,'' said John Hogan, a Philadelphia labor organizer and
spokesman for the R2D2K Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   However, law enforcement agencies have formed their own
coalition to preserve order in Philadelphia and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service and FBI have helped local and state police in
planning security. In both cities, there will be buffer zones
around the convention sites where demonstrations are banned. Police
hope to confine protests to a designated and guarded area. Similar
restrictions were imposed around previous political conventions.
</P>
<P>
   But protest leaders said they won't be penned in.
</P>
<P>
   The ``protest pits'' established by police ``are like prisons,
and none of us intend to go there,'' said Prescod, co-founder of
International Black Women for Wages for Housework.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both permitted and non-permitted events will be taking
place,'' said Cheri Honkala, a formerly homeless single mother and
co-chair of the National Welfare Rights Union.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the street protests, ``shadow conventions'' will be
taking place in auditoriums several blocks from the Republican and
Democratic sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The official conventions ``will be boring, scripted
coronations,'' said Chuck Collins, co-founder of United for a Fair
Economy, (cq) which advocates redistribution of wealth. The shadow
conventions will feature ``real debate'' and ``substantive forums''
as well as parody and humorous commentary on the actual
conventions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said about 3,000 people will take part in the shadow
conventions. R2D2K Coalition leaders predicted at least 10 times
that many protesters will be on the streets of Philadelphia and Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Since hotels are already booked by Republicans and Democratic

 &HT;    PROTESTERS SAY THEY'LL BE ACTIVE OUTSIDE POLITICAL CONVENTIONS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Promising a pox on both political parties, an array
of activists warned Thursday that they will take over the streets
outside the Republican and Democratic national conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had enough,'' said Margaret Prescod, a leader of the
R2D2K Coalition of protest groups. ``Get ready for a democratic
intervention on both coasts of the United States this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   The movement includes many of the anti-globalist militants who
disrupted the World Trade Organization conference in Seattle and
besieged the World Bank meetings in Washington this year.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference, they outlined plans for similar actions
when the Republicans meet in Philadelphia from July 31 to Aug. 4
and when the Democrats convene in Los Angeles from Aug. 14-18.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for a change,'' said Lisa Fithian, who wore a ``Shut
It Down'' T-shirt from the Direct Action Network. ``In Philadelphia
and Los Angeles, we say, 'No more business as usual.' ``
</P>
<P>
   The organizers said both major parties are controlled by
multinational corporate interests, and neither is accountable to
poor and working people. While representing causes varying from
labor unions to homeless mothers, they said they were unified in
demanding a political system ``based on human need, and not on
corporate greed.''
</P>
<P>
   The organizers predicted tens of thousands of activists will
take part in demonstrations ranging from marches to street theater.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, where the Republicans will nominate Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas for president, poor people will camp out in a
``Bushville'' modeled after the ``Hoovervilles'' of the Great
Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Convention Center in Los Angeles, thousands of
people will bang on drums, paint buckets, pots and pans during Vice
President Al Gore's acceptance speech for the Democratic
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to take to the streets because they still belong
to us,'' said John Hogan, a Philadelphia labor organizer and
spokesman for the R2D2K Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   However, law enforcement agencies have formed their own
coalition to preserve order in Philadelphia and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service and FBI have helped local and state police in
planning security. In both cities, there will be buffer zones
around the convention sites where demonstrations are banned. Police
hope to confine protests to a designated and guarded area. Similar
restrictions were imposed around previous political conventions.
</P>
<P>
   But protest leaders said they won't be penned in.
</P>
<P>
   The ``protest pits'' established by police ``are like prisons,
and none of us intend to go there,'' said Prescod, co-founder of
International Black Women for Wages for Housework.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both permitted and non-permitted events will be taking
place,'' said Cheri Honkala, a formerly homeless single mother and
co-chair of the National Welfare Rights Union.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the street protests, ``shadow conventions'' will be
taking place in auditoriums several blocks from the Republican and
Democratic sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The official conventions ``will be boring, scripted
coronations,'' said Chuck Collins, co-founder of United for a Fair
Economy, (cq) which advocates redistribution of wealth. The shadow
conventions will feature ``real debate'' and ``substantive forums''
as well as parody and humorous commentary on the actual
conventions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said about 3,000 people will take part in the shadow
conventions. R2D2K Coalition leaders predicted at least 10 times
that many protesters will be on the streets of Philadelphia and Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Since hotels are already booked by Republicans and Democratic
conventioneers and by the news media, organizers said the
demonstrators will be staying in churches, private homes, parks and
campgrounds. Labor unions are providing some of the funding.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers promised their protests will be peaceful, but
said they are worried about violence by police.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia has already enacted ``an anti-mask ordinance'' and
police are clearly targeting the black-clad anarchists who
protested in Seattle and the capital, said Susan Whitaker, an
activist leader.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers said they are equally disgusted with both
political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to set up a radical participatory democracy _ a
political system where we all participate in decisions that affect
us,'' said Whitaker.

CHILD'S PLAY THE WAY IT USED TO BE 
</HEADLINE>
   By WENDY MOONEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   R2D2, meet Barbie. Vintage toys and dolls are in, not that they
ever went out. There are specialty auctions, Web sites, collector
clubs, swap meets. There are sales four times a year in
Gaithersburg, Md., as well as the twice yearly Atlantique Fairs,
sales that attract tens of thousands to Atlantic City. There are
more than 80 dealers on nadda.org, the Web site of the National
Antique Doll Dealers Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a baby boomer thing,'' said George Glastris, head of the
toy and doll department at Skinner, the Boston auction house.
``It's about nostalgia and recapturing our youth, even for
35-year-old yuppies like me. The robots are a guy thing. Dolls are
for girls.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Saturday's auction at Skinner, with 694 lots, is its
biggest toy sale to date. The sale includes wind-up toys,
lithographed tinplate vehicles, dolls, 18th-century Neapolitan
creche figures, toy soldiers, cast iron banks, board games, puzzles
and robots.
</P>
<P>
   Vintage toys are evaluated according to rarity and condition.
``Great age is not important for toys, dolls and collectibles,''
Carol Prisant writes in the ``Antiques Roadshow Primer.'' ``Toys
made before World War II are considered `antique,' while toys made
after the war are `modern.'''
</P>
<P>
   Old toys need not be expensive. Skinner has given many lots $200
estimates, though not the star ones. These include rare robots like
the Robby Space Patrol. (The word robot, coined by the Czech writer
Karel Capek, comes from the Czech word robota, meaning compulsory
labor like that of a serf.) Robby the Robot was made famous by the
classic 1956 science-fiction film ``Forbidden Planet.'' A robot who
drove a space vehicle across a windswept alien planet, he has
become an icon among robot collectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's also rare,'' Glastris said. ``I've never sold one
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Bergin, a private dealer in New Hampshire who specializes
in vintage robots and space toys (www.bergintoys.com), said:
``Today, kids and Generation X, at least the 15- to 20-year-olds,
are turned on by them. They are even showing up in MTV videos.''
</P>
<P>
   To Bergin, robots represent not nostalgia but the future and the
unknown. ``These robots are futuristic in form and design,'' he
said. ``The toys are 50 years old, and we still don't have real
robots yet. We are just on the verge.''
</P>
<P>
   Robots are also popular among graphic artists. ``It's because
they have a `Pulp Fiction' kind of art,'' Bergin said. ``Robots and
robot boxes probably have better graphics than any other toy.''
</P>
<P>
   This may explain the astronomical prices robots can fetch.
Sotheby's London has sold a rare Robby for $74,000. That set a
record for a robot sold at auction, but Bergin said he had sold
robots for more. At the moment he has a red Robby Space Trooper in
its original box for $7,500 and a black Robby Space Trooper without
its box for $1,500. He recommended that would-be collectors read
``Future Toys,'' by Antoni Emchowicz and Paul Nunneley (New
Cavendish Books).
</P>
<P>
   A quick survey on the Web proves you can also buy other
movie-star toy robots made more recently, including a robot
inspired by the Maria in Fritz Lang's 1926 German film
``Metropolis''; Hal 9000, from ``2001: A Space Odyssey''; both 3CPO
and R2D2 from ``Star Wars''; and Vanessa Rembot from ``Austin
Powers.'' Robots rule!
</P>
<P>
   Dolls have been cherished since men lived in caves. ``Dolls are
the second most highly collected antiques, after stamps and
coins,'' said Dorothy McGonagle, the doll specialist at Skinner.
</P>
<P>
   They tend to be classified according to the material used to
make the head: wood, china, cloth, wax and plastic, among others.
``The head is 90 percent of a doll,'' McGonagle said. ``Some
manufacturers made only heads, and others made the bodies. Then
dolls were sent off to the couturier for dressing. In the late
1800s, Paris shops like Au Nain Bleu acted as a middleman. It would
have samples, so the customer could specify what head and dress she
wanted. They must have had teams of seamstresses making the
outfits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dolls are a mirror of society,'' McGonagle continued. ``Dolls
reflect what is going on in a culture at a given time. In the 19th
century, for example, France was the fashion capital of the world,
and costume was an important part of French life and the French
economy. So the French produced fashion dolls, dolls depicted as
upper-class ladies in couture. They are the predecessors of Barbie,
the fashion doll of the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan specialty shops like Second Childhood on Bleecker
Street and Iris Brown Antique Dolls on East 57th Street sell such
dolls. Richard Wright, a dealer in Birchrunville, Pa., also has a
selection of rare European toys and dolls.
</P>
<P>
   There are two schools of thought about fashion dolls, said
McGonagle, author of ``The Dolls of Jules Nicolas Steiner.'' ``Some
say they were a way France exported its fashions. I think these
dolls were to play with. They were made at a time when the middle
class was burgeoning and people had money. It was the right time
for a huge development in doll making. Such dolls came with
accessories: crosses, enameled watches, rings, rosary beads and
necklaces, to name a few.''
</P>
<P>
   Iris Brown disagrees. ``These dolls are not really for
children,'' she said. ``They have survived because they were put on
shelves. Girls just looked at them.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the 19th century, dolls tended to look like miniature
adults. They probably look like adults because children were
expected to act like adults, McGonagle said. ``Early dolls were
also very pale, because ladies stayed inside,'' she added. ``Later
on you see healthier coloring.'' Dolls were adults dressed as
children until the 1870s, when the child began to be glorified and
doll forms were rendered as babies and children.
</P>
<P>
   French companies like Bru, Jumeau and Steiner all produced fine
child dolls. Lot 171 in the Skinner sale is a rare French Bru Bebe
doll called Zepherine from the late 1870s. Her beautifully modeled
head and delicate (repainted) hands are bisque, while the body is
made of kid leather. She looks very grown up, with protruding
breasts and a (replacement) blond wig framing her face. She has
enormous cornflower blue eyes made of paperweight glass, arched
eyebrows and long eyelashes that have been painted on. She wears
her original cotton chemise underdress, which originally would have
had a fabulous outfit over it. The estimated selling price for the
doll is $8,000 to $12,000.
</P>
<P>
   Collectors have arcane criteria when judging dolls. ``A good
doll, like a good woman, keeps her eyes open and her mouth shut,''
McGonagle said, quoting an adage.
</P>
<P>
   To Bergin, a robot is really an industrial doll. ``They mesh the
computer age with the human age,'' he said. For him, the only good
doll (or robot) is one that can move in mysterious ways. To each
his own.

AMTRAK IS OFFERING EVERY DISSATISFIED RIDER A FREE TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
  By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Amtrak said Thursday that it would offer every
dissatisfied customer a free repeat trip, even if the problem was
not the railroad's fault.
</P>
<P>
   The new program is part of its campaign to build ridership and
revenues by reducing the number of disgruntled passengers, before
Congress cuts off operating subsidies in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``This grabs people's attention in the marketplace,'' said
George Warrington, president of Amtrak, who added that no other
national carrier offered a similar program. This one is retroactive
to July 4.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak's reputation among potential passengers has historically
been poor, Warrington acknowledged, because of trains that are late
or in poor condition. He said the new program was intended to
demonstrate ``Amtrak's ability, desire and fixation about putting
guests at the center of everything we do.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also revealed a new logo, to replace the ``pointless
arrow,'' as it is known, that has served for the last 29 years. The
company plans to redesign waiting rooms, ticket booths, platform
displays and schedules themselves, to match.
</P>
<P>
   To exercise the new guarantee, Amtrak is asking its customers to
call their complaints to the attention of any employee. If the
employee cannot solve the problem Amtrak will issue coupons for
repeat travel.
</P>
<P>
   The company anticipates, for example, issuing coupons to
individuals for a problem with a seat or a sleeping compartment or
to all passengers onboard if a train is extremely late. Amtrak
promises to provide the free ride coupon even if the problem is an
ice storm, or derailment of another train. ``Regardless of fault,
in the end, it's Amtrak that's responsible,'' Warrington said
during a meeting with reporters Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak estimates that for every 100 people who try the railroad
for the first time, 15 percent never ride again. If Amtrak can
raise that rate by 1 percent, its revenues would rise by $13
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The railroad has also trained on-board personnel to help
passengers if a train is going to be late, by telephoning ahead to
relatives who were planning to pick them up at the station, for
example, or re-booking connections and hotel accommodations.
Company officials said they were taking cues from what travelers
expect from airlines under similar circumstances.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For the last three years Amtrak has been offering a similar
satisfaction guarantee on a single train, the Coast Starlight,
which runs daily in each direction between Seattle and Los Angeles,
and has issued one coupon good for a free trip for each 107,000
passengers carried, Warrington said.
</P>
<P>
   But the railroad expects a much higher rate of complaints and
refunds on other trains. It has told its 25,000 employees that if
the rate of complaints runs better than one in 1,000 trips during
any given month, each of them will get a bonus for that month equal
to the average price of an Amtrak ticket, which is now about $50.
</P>
<P>
   The railroad, created by Congress in 1971 as a way to preserve
the passenger service that the investor-owned railroads were
closing down, said that ridership was up 7 percent in the last four
months compared with the previous year, and that in June, for the
first time ever, it had revenues of $100 million. Passenger loads
on its four daily all-electric ``Acela Regional'' trains running
between Washington and Boston are up 40 percent over the older
trains they replaced, the railroad said.
</P>
<P>
   The railroad intends to introduce its high-speed Acela service,
with a top speed of 150 mph, later this summer. That had been
scheduled for last year, but problems were found in testing.

&HT;     NASCAR RACES AHEAD AS A FAVORITE PASTIME 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MICHAEL PARKER  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is the fastest growing sport in America. Thousands of
spectators flock to the main event each Sunday, and millions more
watch on television. Marketing executives covet the biggest stars
as product endorsers. Fans adore them.
</P>
<P>
   This not the NFL. This not the PGA tour.
</P>
<P>
   This is the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing. This
is NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   While other sports plateaued or declined in attendance during
the 1990s, NASCAR boomed, nearly doubling in on-track spectators
between 1990 and 1999, when more than 6.6 million people attended
the 34 Winston Cup events.
</P>
<P>
   But attendance only begins to tell the story of NASCAR's
meteoric rise. Television ratings are up in recent years, and sales
of licensed merchandise have skyrocketed more than 1,400 percent in
the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors have contributed to NASCAR's rise, not the least
of which is a shrewd and thorough marketing plan that relies
largely on the athletes themselves to make it work.
</P>
<P>
   In an age when the sports section is littered with reports of
athletes behaving badly, ask yourself this: When was the last time
you read, saw, or heard anything about a NASCAR driver running
afoul of the law or displaying contempt for fans or the media?
</P>
<P>
   ``They are heroes to their fans,'' said Brett Yormark, NASCAR's
managing director of corporate marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The hero, however, isn't always the guy in the white hat. This
is NASCAR, remember, an organization that traces its roots to
Southern bootlegging, and there's no one in the game today who
conjures that image more than hard-driving Dale Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt is a roguish figure with a brush-like mustache and a
fondness for mirrored shades, the kind through which you can smirk
at the world and never meet an eye in return. Don't look for him to
teach your local defensive driving course. He'll bump, nudge, test
your mettle and your metal _ all at 150 mph _ if that's what it
takes to get his car under the checkered flag first.
</P>
<P>
   He does it all in a big black Chevrolet, the No. 3 car. His fans
know it as the GM Goodwrench Chevrolet, just as Dale Jarrett's fans
know he drives the Quality Care Ford and Jeff Gordon's fans know he
drives the DuPont Chevrolet.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt and NASCAR have grown together, the popularity of one
no doubt fueling the rise of the other. In many ways, Earnhardt
epitomizes the NASCAR ideal _ tough and uncompromising on the
track, human and approachable off it. He signs autographs and poses
for pictures with fans in wheelchairs. And, like any ordinary
father might, he cried the first time his son, Dale Jr., won a
Winston Cup race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of like the Pettys. Earnhardt equals NASCAR,'' said
Sally Chittenden, the general manager of ``Victory Lane,'' a
NASCAR-themed cafe and store in Queensbury, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR's appeal, too, is its familiarity. It's possible for the
fans to imagine themselves in the driver's seat, because these are,
after all, souped up Fords, Chevys and Pontiacs, not the low-slung,
open-wheeled speed machines of the Indianapolis 500 and Formula
One.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike other sports, the entire NASCAR season is one large
playoff for the championship. Every race counts, and every driver
who wants to win the championship shows up to compete. The driver
who starts the race gets credit for the points, so it's not
uncommon to see a driver with bone fractures of one kind or another
gut it out for a lap or two before handing the wheel to a
substitute, all in the name of staying in contention for the points
title.
</P>
<P>
   The foreseeable future looks as bright as the recent past for
NASCAR, which will begin the 2001 season with a new television
contract and two new race venues. The first half of the season will
be aired on Fox, the second half on NBC. This year, as in years
past, a handful of marquee races were on network television,
including Saturday night's primetime broadcast of the Pepsi 400 on
CBS. The rest are on cable, primarily ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be going from 70 million homes to 100 million homes,''
Yormark said. ``Add in the new racetracks near Chicago and Kansas
City, and we see only continued growth for NASCAR and its
sponsors.''
</P>
<P>
   The expansion of the Winston Cup series to those major
Midwestern cities will give NASCAR a strong foothold in all the
regions of the United States, including the Northeast, where tracks
in Watkins Glen, Loudon, N.H., Dover, Del., and Long Pond, Pa., are
filled to capacity when the series comes to town.
</P>
<P>
   The broad national appeal also is reflected in the demographics
of the fans. NASCAR research shows that more 40 percent of those
who identify themselves as fans went to college, and that more 37
percent earn more than $50,000 per year.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dover Downs International itself offers a snapshot of NASCAR's
surge. The track, which hosts two Winston Cup events each year, had
22,000 grandstand seats in 1986. Today it has 133,000, with a goal
of 170,000. Every race is sold out.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket costs are rising to help pay for expansion at Dover and
elsewhere, but so far the sport hasn't seen the backlash that
accompanied price increases in the other major U.S. sports. At
Dover, you can expect to pay between $60 and $90 for bleacher
seats. If you don't want to have the person in front of you sitting
in your lap, you'll need to pay the higher price.
</P>
<P>
   One of NASCAR's next big targets is New York City, and though
nothing concrete is being proposed, Yormark said, ``it's on our
radar screen.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, NASCAR fans will have to be satisfied with the
2,000 races a year in 13 series that NASCAR oversees. Those in
search of a quick fix can visit www.nascar.com, which gets about
300,000 visits a day, according to Yormark, more than any other
sport-specific site on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Fans who go on-line or tune in looking for the sport's next star
needn't look far. Dale Earnhardt Jr. has Gordon's clean image _ an
image that has made Gordon a lightning rod for the wrath of fans
who prefer drivers with grease under their nails _ and an
organization that has the financial wherewithal to produce
immediate success. Coming off back-to-back championships on the
Busch Grand National circuit, NASCAR's minor league, Earnhardt Jr.,
at 25, already is on his way to the most impressive rookie campaign
in Winston Cup history. He was the first driver this year to
collect two Winston Cup wins. Two more would give him the rookie
record.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR does have its drawbacks. Huge crowds mean long waits and
lots of traffic. Once inside, be prepared to shell out 10 bucks for
a program, and 20 for a shirt or hat with your favorite driver's
name on it. Add another five for a beer brought to you by Earnhardt
Jr. and his Budweiser racing team, but don't expect it to be all
that cold.
</P>

   Once in your seat, don't get up or you'll miss the show. Things
happen fast in this sport. If you miss a lap, though, there's no
need to worry; they come around 400 more times before it's over.
And even then, you can still tune in next Sunday.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies

<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Across the Sea of Time'' G
</P>
<P>
   3-D Imax film
</P>
<P>
   about New York City.
</P>
<P>
   History comes alive visually in this 3-D Imax movie focusing on
New York City. It's full of big, gloriously detailed ``stereoview''
photographs depicting immigrant life at the turn of the century.
(Bob Longino)
</P>
<P>
   51 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Adventures of
</P>
<P>
   Rocky and Bullwinkle'' PG (brief mild language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robert De Niro, Rene Russo
</P>
<P>
   and Jason Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   The live-action and animated comedy drags the heroic squirrel
and moose into the 21st century, and into three dimensions. The
movie front-loads its clever bits, and its second half offers
diminishing returns. It keeps you awake with its throwaway sight
gags, retro tone recalling ``Austin Powers'' and its pop culture
japes. (SM) 1 hour, 32 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys and Girls'' PG-13 (sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Freddie Prinze Jr.
</P>
<P>
   and Claire Forlani.
</P>
<P>
   A peculiarly old-fashioned romantic comedy trapped in college
clothing, the movie throws in one innovative switch by reversing
gender roles. Here it's the girl (Claire Forlani) who's the casual
one-night stander and the guy (Freddie Prinze Jr.) who's the
near-virginal ingenue nattering on about having ``to work at love
if you want it to last.'' (SM) 1 hour, 33 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Butterfly'' R (sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Manuel Lozano
</P>
<P>
   and Fernando Fernan Gomez.
</P>
<P>
   Seen through the eyes of 6-year-old Moncho (Manuel Lozano), the
countryside of Galicia, in northern Spain, is a place of young
fears and growing wonders. ``Butterfly'' is about a young boy
inspired to learn by the teacher (Fernando Fernan Gomez) who
frightens him the most. It builds slowly and then explodes, showing
us how fear can turn good people into mundane monsters. (SM) 1
hour, 35 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicken Run'' G
</P>
<P>
   Featuring the voices of Mel Gibson
</P>
<P>
   and Miranda Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Set on a chicken farm in 1950s Britain, the movie is about some
hens' repeated attempts to fly the coop after their villainous
owner decides there's more money in chicken pies than in chickens.
If you're in the mood for something offbeat and wackily deadpan,
this may be just your kind of amiably bird-brained entertainment.
(ERG) 1 hour, 22 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Color of Paradise'' PG (thematic elements)
</P>
<P>
   In Persian with subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mohsen Ramezani
</P>
<P>
   and Hossein Mahjub.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of a young sightless boy, it's a gorgeous meditation on
blindness, both physical and spiritual. Filled with dread and
beauty, director Majid Majidi's film summons the power of a fable,
suggesting that those with sight can be the blindest of all.
Stunningly shot by Mohammad Davudi, the film puts an emphasis on
the boy's hands stretching out into the natural world. (SM) 1 hour,
30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Croupier'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Starring Clive Owen
</P>
<P>
   and Alex Kingston.
</P>
<P>
   This 1998 French film involves a struggling author who takes a
job at a casino running a roulette wheel to look for wrtiting
inspiration. Soon he's convinced to join a robbery scheme.
``Croupier'' has more on its mind than danger and plot twists. It's
a fascinating, hard-edged portrait of a man who swears he doesn't
gamble. (SM) 1 hour, 31 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Dinosaur'' PG (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of D.B. Sweeney,
</P>
<P>
   Della Reese and Julianna Margulies.
</P>
<P>
   Leapin' lizards! The prehistoric critters in Disney's
years-in-the-making, $200 million-plus computer animation do more
than leap. Alas, the plot is worth about two cents _ something
about an iguanodon raised by lemurs who helps a herd of dinosaurs
find a fabled nesting ground after a disastrous meteor shower.
Parents be aware: While most of the movie is Barney-tame, the scary
parts are quite scary. (ERG) 1 hour, 24 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney's The Kid'' PG (mild profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis
</P>
<P>
   and Spencer Breslin.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Willis may grow tired of being upstaged by children. Haley
Joel Osment ran off with last year's ``The Sixth Sense,'' and this
time, 8-year-old Spencer Breslin steals what little thunder there
is to rumble about in this sickly sweet film. Willis plays a loner
who magically meets his embarrassing child self, Rusty (Breslin).
(David Germain, Associated Press) 1 hour, 44 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Fantasia / 2000'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mickey Mouse,
</P>
<P>
   Steve Martin and Bette Midler.
</P>
<P>
   The entirety of this new ``Fantasia'' isn't worth one whirling
mushroom from the 1940 original. The movie lacks the wit, charm,
warmth, humor and awe of its predecessor, underscored by the
inclusion of one old segment, ``The Sorcerer's Apprentice.'' Our
advice: Drop off the kids, go shopping, then go rent the original.
(ERG) 1 hour, 30 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Frequency'' PG-13 (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Dennis Quaid
</P>
<P>
   and Jim Caviezel.
</P>
<P>
   John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel) hears dead people. Specifically, he
hooks up to his dad's old ham radio set in 1999 and finds himself
talking to his dad (Dennis Quaid) in 1969. More crucially, John
knows his dad, a fireman, will be killed in a failed heroic rescue
the next day. Although over-plotted, the sentimental film has that
``what if?'' fascination. It's also a mind-bender and especially
savvy about emotional button-pushing. (ERG) 2 hours. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Gladiator'' R (extreme violence,
</P>
<P>
   perverse sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Russell Crowe.
</P>
<P>
   Two thousand _ or, if you want to add computer effects, 200,000
_ thumbs up for Ridley Scott's spectacle starring Russell Crowe as
a Roman general, who returns to the Colosseum to take revenge on
the odious Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). The battles staged
before the mob of mindless ancient Romans are the film's
centerpieces, but its brave heart (so to speak) is Crowe. (ERG) 2
hours, 33 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Gone in 60 Seconds'' PG-13 (sexuality,
</P>
<P>
   profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Nicolas Cage
</P>
<P>
   and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas Cage plays Memphis Raines, a reformed car thief called
back behind the wheel when his little brother bungles a deal for a
British crime lord. If you sit through the usual formula garbage,
``Gone'' delivers a long, harrowing car chase that easily outdoes
the motorcycle finale in ``M: I-2.'' A few IQ points may be lost
while watching the flick. But you'll be having too much fun to
care. (SM) 1 hour, 59 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Groove'' R (drug use, language
</P>
<P>
   and brief sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Lola Glaudini
</P>
<P>
   and Hamish Linklater.
</P>
<P>
   The second rave movie of the year, ``Groove'' tracks a handful
of San Franciscan partiers who venture to an abandoned warehouse in
hopes of an all-night rave party. The problem with any movie about
an altered state _ whether it's a dream, or in this case a
drug-and-sound-fueled dance party _ is it's very hard to capture on
film the subjective highs of the real thing. (SM) 1 hour, 26
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamlet'' R (some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ethan Hawke,
</P>
<P>
   Kyle MacLachlan, Diane Venora
</P>
<P>
   and Bill Murray.
</P>
<P>
   In its bare outline, a modern-day, Manhattan-based version of
Shakespeare's tragedy sounds like the bad thesis project of a New
York University film student. True enough, Michael Almereyda's
update flirts with the ludicrous in every reel. But it's ultimately
a compelling and streamlined vision that lives surprisingly well in
the city's hard-edged, chilly streets and penthouses. (SM) 1 hour,
51 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Interview'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Starring Hugo Weaving
</P>
<P>
   and Tony Martin.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tense battle of strategy at a police station where the
cops are trying to get a confession from a man (Hugo Weaving) with
a spotless record that he's the serial killer who's been randomly
choosing victims from the lonely Australian roadways. Weaving gives
a riveting performance. (SM) One hour, 41 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus' Son'' R (prophanity, sexual and
</P>
<P>
   drug content, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Billy Crudup
</P>
<P>
   and Samantha Morton.
</P>
<P>
   Like the book of Denis Johnsons' vivid short stories that it's
based on, the movie mirrors its protagonist's sense of dislocation
as it woozily tours a few years in the life of a boozing,
pill-popping young man (Billy Crudup). The film is like
``Trainspotting'' or ``Drugstore Cowboy'' played out on the
suicidally prosaic Midwest plains. (SM) 1 hour, 50 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene'' R (sexual content, crude
</P>
<P>
   humor, profanity and some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jim Carrey
</P>
<P>
   and Renee Zellweger.
</P>
<P>
   Those impish filmmaking Farrelly brothers, Peter and Bobby,
prove yet again that, no matter how foul and nasty their humor,
they understand very clearly how to set up the joke and when to
fire the over-the-top punch. This movie, starring Jim Carrey and
Renee Zellweger, is bound to make you laugh. Too bad it's clueless
when it comes to constructing a plot with which to thread the
powerful jokes. (Bob Longino) 2 hours. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Jordan to the Max'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Imax documentary
</P>
<P>
   about Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   It shoots; it scores. Like Mount Everest, Michael Jordan has his
own 2-D Imax film. It's the biggest format for the biggest sports
story ever told. Part bio, part well-deserved pat on the back, it's
a loving look at the Chicago Bulls superstar and hones in on the
1998 NBA playoffs when a determined Jordan led his team to a sixth
championship before retirement. (Bob Longino) 45 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Mission: Impossible 2'' PG-13 (intense sequences of violent
</P>
<P>
   action and some sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Cruise
</P>
<P>
   and Thandie Newton.
</P>
<P>
   This underscripted sequel, directed by John Woo, is a
full-fledged Tom Cruise star vehicle as he battles baddies after an
Ebola-like virus. The movie contains overamplified kung-fu fights
and a very long motorcycle chase consisting of quick, tight shots.
The sexy Thandie Newton holds her own in the film's first half, but
gets demoted to playing the Girl for the last act. She deserves
better. So do we. (SM) 2 hours, 6 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Old Man and the Sea'' Unrated.
</P>
<P>
   A live-action animated short.
</P>
<P>
   This 'toon, based on an Ernest Hemingway novel, is, like the
author's word choice, deceptively simple and strikingly beautiful.
It's everything a moviegoer would expect, but didn't get, from
``Fantasia/2000.'' (Bob Longino) A-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Patriot'' R (strong war violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mel Gibson,
</P>
<P>
   Heath Ledger and Jason Isaacs.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Gibson single-handedly wins the American Revolution, among
other historical revisions. The latest from Roland Emmerich takes
the jingoistic spirit of his ``Independence Day'' and amps it to a
feverish, flag-waving pitch. The movie is beautiful on the eye and
crafted with great care. It relies on oversimplification, cheap
sentiment and a villain so two-dimensionally nasty even Satan
wouldn't claim him. (SM) 2 hours, 44 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Perfect Storm'' PG-13 (profanity and scenes of peril)
</P>
<P>
   Starring George Clooney,
</P>
<P>
   Mark Wahlberg and Diane Lane.
</P>
<P>
   The fishermen of the Andrea Gail take a pounding, and so does
the audience in the latest m7 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Shanghai Noon'' PG-13 (action violence, some
</P>
<P>
   drug humor, profanity and sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jackie Chan
</P>
<P>
   and Owen Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Martial arts whiz Jackie Chan plays a Chinese imperial guardsman
who volunteers to head to the United States to rescue a kidnapped
princess. ``Noon'' lets Chan use moose antlers, horse shoes and
pine saplings as weapons, take a big fall from a mission bell
tower, and contend with a drunken horse. The film lassos all the
revisionist laughs and action scenes that last summer's ``Wild Wild
West'' botched. (SM) 1 hour, 45 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunshine'' R (nudity, sex and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ralph Fiennes,
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Ehle and Rosemary Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Though overlong (three hours) and not a very smiley-face story
(the title is ironic), this bleak, sweeping epic is still worth
your time and effort. Oscar-winning director Istvan Szabo
(``Mephisto'') examines the first half of the 20th century through
the painful prism of three generations of a Jewish family in
Hungary. Ralph Fiennes plays the central male in each passage along
with a fine supporting cast. (ERG) 3 hours. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Titan A.E.'' PG (some cartoon violence)
</P>
<P>
   Featuring the voices of
</P>
<P>
   Drew Barrymore and Matt Damon.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a good sign when a 'toon's backgrounds are more
interesting than the plot and characters. ``Titan'' is an animation
set in the 31st century after Earth has been destroyed. The human
race's only hope is a guy named Cale (voiced by Matt Damon) who's
the key to the missing Titan project designed by his dad. Like most
sci-fi flicks, this one is more of a super-deluxe episode of the
old ``Jonny Quest'' series. (ERG) 1 hour, 30 minutes. C-

 &HT;    A parody so raunchy it's `Scary'
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine Hollywood's crude-humor fixation getting
much lower. ``There's Something About Mary'' had its hair gel.
``Road Trip'' maimed an order of French toast. ``Me, Myself &AMP;
Irene'' took a chicken and ... well, let's not even go there.
</P>
<P>
   Like those films, ``Scary Movie'' takes the low road to comedy _
and dives so deep into tasteless humor that it's a wonder it landed
an R rating instead of an NC-17.
</P>
<P>
   Propped up by the Wayans brothers _ that would be Keenen
(writer-director), Shawn (writer-actor) and Marlon (writer-actor),
and they are a talented bunch _ ``Scary Movie'' is a parody of the
teen horror flicks that constituted the bulk of movie fare the past
four summers.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Scream'' trilogy, ``I Know What You Did Last Summer,''
``The Blair Witch Project'' and, just because it was popular, ``The
Matrix,'' all get skewered in a thousand jokes that are either
hilarious, mildly funny, not funny, crude, offensive or absolutely
offensive.
</P>
<P>
   It's somewhat like a ``South Park'' movie without the social and
political zingers.
</P>
<P>
   If you must know the plot, it goes something like this: the
opening of ``Scream,'' more ``Scream,'' the road kill of ``Last
Summer,'' more ``Scream,'' more ``Last Summer,'' the woods of
``Blair Witch,'' a bit of ``Scream 2,'' the freaky effects of
``Matrix'' and a lot more ``Scream.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie's six writers basically take each film and turn it on
its head. Like ``Airplane!,'' it's a series of goofy jokes,
put-downs and sight gags, but with heftier doses of sex, private
parts, drugs, profanity and _ this being a slasher film _ violence.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Scary Movie'' works, it can be a lot of fun. Way more
than it should, it overplays its jokes. Other times it's just
crude, rude and socially unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scary Movie''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Anna Faris, Jon Abrahams, Shawn Wayans and Marlon
Wayans. Directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans. Rated R for strong crude
sexual humor, profanity, drug use and violence. At metro theaters.
1 hour,
</P>
<P>
   28 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Sometimes funny, sometimes just too crude.
</P>

   Today
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Big Brother'' (8 p.m., CBS, 4674) _ Episode 3 of a projected
gazillion episodes, and already a national groundswell is ready to
vote the two most annoying people out of the house. That, of
course, would be hosts Julie Chen and Ian O'Malley.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Jerry Springer'' (11 p.m., WAGA, 72262) _ I just noticed
that TV Guide lists Springer's show as ``Discussion.'' Apparently
the analyses of the disputants are not rarefied enough to qualify
it as a salon.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Biography: Ernest Borgnine'' (8 p.m., A&AMP;E, 593755) _ Summer
is traditionally the time when cable puts on snappy new programming
to lure viewers away from the broadcast networks. And nothing says
snappy like an hour on Ernest Borgnine.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The 1900 House Marathon'' (3-7 p.m. , WGTV, 28408, 12083,
7335, 16373) _ No, it doesn't get the ratings of CBS's ``Survivor''
(but then again, you never had to watch Richard get naked). ``The
1900 House,'' however, got big ratings for PBS. An interesting
wrinkle in the current voyeur-vision craze, it followed a real
British family trying to live exactly as their ancestors did 100
years ago and not always real happy about it. WGTV reruns the four
hours as a block.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Longitude'' (8 p.m., 571847 A&AMP;E) _ A four-hour docudrama
about scientific efforts to improve maritime navigation? Whoa,
baby, dibs on the Barcalounger!
</P>
<P>
   All scoffing aside, ``Longitude'' has an excellent pedigree,
most notably its two stars, Jeremy Irons (``The French Lieutenant's
Woman,'' ``Lolita'') and Michael Gambon (``The Singing
Detective),'' and writer-director Charles Sturridge, who did the
great ``Brideshead Revisited'' so many years ago. Gambon plays John
Harrison, the 18th-century tinkerer whose solutions to the problem
of mapping longitude were mocked, and Irons plays Rupert Gould, the
early 20th-century British Navy officer who reconstructed
Harrison's work.
</P>
<P>
   Movies
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Fled'' (8 p.m. Saturday, WATL, 427137) _ Laurence Fishburne
and Stephen Baldwin star as escaped cons in a flick notable mostly
for scenes shot at Stone Mountain Park.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Dirty Dancing'' (8:05 p.m. Saturday, TBS, 1583205) _ While
America waits for the we'll-believe-it-when-we-see-it rumored
remake with Ricky Martin and Britney Spears, you can still get down
with the original with Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Great Escape'' (2:30 a.m. Saturday, TBS, 717868) _
``Chicken Run,'' but with people. Cool idea.
</P>
<P>
   Best Bet
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Freaks and Geeks Marathon'' (8-11 p.m. Saturday, NBC, 33601,
20137, 23224).
</P>
<P>
   Talk about bittersweet. ``Freaks and Geeks'' was a real
heartbreaker of a series, the intricately interwoven tales of
various high school losers, circa 1980. Funny, poignant, brutally
real at times, it had a grasp of high school hierarchies (of any
era), of petty rivalries and soaring moments of triumph that
bordered on the poetic.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, NBC didn't schedule it well, hardly anyone watched,
and the network axed it before its first season was even over. Now,
as a sort of penance (or the ultimate in chutzpah), NBC is airing
three unseen episodes.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Smooching and Mooching'' at 8 p.m., sweet geek Sam (John
Daley) plans to go to a makeout party with cheerleader Cindy
Sanders. ``The Little Things'' at 9 p.m. guest stars Ben Stiller as
a Secret Service agent advancing a visit to the high school by Vice
President George Bush. And in ``Discos and Dragons'' at 10 p.m.,

COMPENSATION FOR NAZI-ERA LABORERS APPROVED BY GERMAN PARLIAMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ More than a half-century after the end of
Hitler's Third Reich, the German parliament approved legislation
Thursday that will govern a $5 billion humanitarian fund for
Nazi-era slave workers and other victims of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, passed by an overwhelming majority of 556-42, is
intended to bring a close, at least legally, to the most brutal
chapter in German history.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's vote was not surprising, because it essentially
ratified an agreement reached after more than a year of grinding
negotiations between representatives of German industry, the German
government and the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   But the new law now sets the stage for payments to Holocaust
survivors before the end of the year. It thus ends a half-century
of denial of responsibility by German manufacturers including the
German subsidiaries of Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Inc.
</P>
<P>
   As envisioned, former slave laborers _ prisoners in
concentration camps who worked without any pay and under
nightmarish conditions _ will be entitled to one-time payments of
up to 15,000 marks, or less than $7,500. Former forced laborers _
people who were dragooned into factories but may have received some
payment _ will get as much as 5,000 marks or about $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   Though the German government has paid out more than $50 billion
in compensation to various groups and to the state of Israel since
World War II, the vast majority of former forced laborers have
received nothing.
</P>
<P>
   German manufacturers argued that they had been forced by the
Nazi regime to use the workers. Under former Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, the German government argued that it had already paid out
full compensation and would not contribute anything more.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate was changed by two things. The first was a new
wave of class-action lawsuits filed in the United States, which
could have potentially inflicted billions of dollars in liabilities
on German companies. The second came when Gerhard Schroeder
replaced Kohl in late 1998 and immediately began pushing for a
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, German industry and the government will
each contribute about $2.5 billion to a fund that will pay
compensation to as many as 1 million former forced laborers. Most
of the victims are in Central Europe and Russia, although many
others are scattered around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The fund will also be used to compensate people who endured
medical experimentation at the hands of Nazi scientists and some of
those whose property was confiscated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have responsibility, because we cannot disclaim the past,
the good much less the bad,'' Hans Eichel, Germany's minister of
finance, told members of the parliament Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate resolution, the parliament formally apologized to
Holocaust victims for taking away their rights, displacement,
maltreatment and exploitation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But despite the lofty goals of reconciliation, sourness also
permeated Thursday's debate in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Otto Lambsdorff, who represented German industry in the long
negotiations with survivors' organizations, U.S. class-action
lawyers and the U. S. government, lashed out angrily at German
companies that refuse to contribute to the new fund.
</P>
<P>
   After more than a year of fund-raising, German industry has thus
far pledged only 3.1 billion marks, or about $1.5 billion from
about 3,000 companies, about $1 billion short of its obligations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a public offense that the majority of companies have not
yet joined up,'' said Lambsdorff, the former German finance
minister. ``All German companies, including those formed after the
war, should contribute to the fund. Those not burdened by the past
should think about reshaping the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The list of companies that have already joined the humanitarian
fund includes most of Germany's big corporate names _ Siemens A.G.,
DaimlerChrysler A.G., Volkswagen A.G. and Deutsche Bank. It also
includes the German subsidiary of General Motors, Adam Opel, as
well as the German subsidiary of Ford.
</P>
<P>
   But many smaller companies have refused to contribute. Many
argue that they did not use forced labor and were themselves
bankrupted during the war.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Manfred Gentz, the chief financial officer of DaimlerChrysler
and leader of the German industry initiative, has recently said he
is confident that the foundation will collect all the money needed
within the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the sluggish progress prompted heavy criticism
from many members of the parliament. ``The behavior of industry is
and remains a scandal,'' said Ulla Jelpke, a member of the Party of
Democratic Socialism, the successor to East Germany's old Communist
Party.
</P>
<P>
   One lingering uncertainty is whether the agreement and the new
law will shield German companies from future lawsuits stemming from
the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Legal immunity from future claims was the central demand by
German corporations, who only began negotiating after being
confronted with a wave of class-action lawsuits filed in the United
States on behalf of former forced and slave workers around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the Clinton administration has devised a
legal declaration urging courts to dismiss any future Holocaust
claims on the grounds that they are best dealt with through the new
humanitarian fund.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials argue that the declaration, which will be
submitted to any court where new lawsuits might be filed, should
provide German companies with the assurances they demand.
</P>
<P>
   But German negotiators have been far less sure, and continued to
demand stronger wording long after both sides announced their basic
agreement last December.
</P>
<P>
   At least one German attorney for Holocaust survivors said on
Thursday that opportunities to file lawsuits still remained.
</P>
<P>
   ``A statement of interest is no guarantee, just a strong
recommendation to a U.S. court,'' said Michael Witti, who has
collaborated with the American class-action lawyer Edward Fagan in
representing many former forced laborers.
</P>
<P>
   Witti said he continued to believe that victims of various
Aryanization programs, used to expropriate property from Jewish
citizens, may still have claims.
</P>
<P>
   Another discordant note to Thursday's proceedings came from a
handful of politicians in Germany's center-right parties, the
Christian Democratic Union and the Christian Social Union, who
voted against the law.
</P>
<P>
   The opponents said Germans had already paid out more than $50
billion in compensation to various groups as well as to the state
of Israel after World War II. They also demanded that the law be
coupled with demands for compensation to German prisoners kept by
Russia at the end of World War II.

 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) On the Fourth of July, 8-month-old Rose Mendell took
part in a family tradition for the first time: a community
Independence Day parade in Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Rose won't remember the marching bands or riding in a stroller
draped with red-white-and-blue bunting, but the snapshots taken by
her mother, Miriam Lewis, will tell her the story someday -- that
is, if they survive.
</P>
<P>
   Lured by ever better and cheaper cameras, more consumers are
going digital. No waiting -- or for that matter, paying -- for
processing. Pictures can be posted to a Web page, printed out an
unlimited number of times, or sent to friends and relatives by
e-mail almost as quickly as they can be taken.
</P>
<P>
   But there may be a hidden cost. Even as they snap away, most
consumers give scant thought to storing their growing collections
of digital photos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we need to deal with greater archiving issues,'' said
Lewis, little Rose's mom. ``We just haven't researched what's best.
It's our intention to do that, but we all know what path good
intentions can take us down.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all irreplaceable, little bits of her life, and I'd
really hate to lose them,'' she said of her 300 megabytes of photos
-- about 214 floppy discs' worth.
</P>
<P>
   Yet lose them she may, if she's not careful.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike conventional photos stuffed into shoeboxes and stashed in
the closet, digital pictures won't survive benign neglect. The data
that make up a digital photo can be easily lost, corrupted, or
simply become obsolete and unreadable. The medium is so new that
there is no tried-and-true method for preserving it for decades,
much less hundreds of years, say experts dealing with this problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you exactly how to store silver gelatin
(black-and-white) photos ... for the next 50 or 100 years,'' said
Andrew Robb, senior photograph conservator for the Library of
Congress in Washington. ``We just can't do the same for digital
images.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the best anyone can do is try to keep moving digital
data to newer media, a process called migration.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's both costly and scary,'' said Kenneth S. Weissman, head
of the Library of Congress Motion Picture Conservation Center in
Dayton, Ohio. ``Once you go digital, you've committed yourself to
constantly migrating your collection.''
</P>
<P>
   Preservationists like Robb say that optical media -- for
instance, DVD, CD-ROM and magneto optical discs -- are the most
stable. And recordable CDs, or CD-Rs, are the cheapest and most
available optical storage.
</P>
<P>
   Yet nobody really knows how long CD-Rs will last. Industry
groups and CD-R manufacturers say the discs can last anywhere from
50 to 300 years based on artificial aging -- a testing process in
which they subject the discs to high heat, radiation and other
destructive forces. Others contend that CD-Rs might last as little
as 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even a disc that lasts five years might outlive the
operating system or file format with which it was created, Robb
warns. That's a predicament akin to reading hieroglyphics without
the Rosetta stone. It can't be done. So data have to keep moving.
</P>
<P>
   And that brings on another hazard. Over the course of years, the
digital language of photography can change. Merely translating
degradation, Weissman warned.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say the best way to save a digital shot is to
convert it back to analog: Print it out.
</P>
<P>
   Many manufacturers make color inkjet printers that create
near-photographic-quality prints, depending on the quality of
photos your camera is capable of taking. Yet, even when printed
out, images can fade in two years if produced with poor quality
paper and ink.
</P>
<P>
   Low-acid and acid-free papers are becoming increasingly
available, Robb said. And inks are improving, too.
</P>
<P>
   While most inks are still based on organic dyes, they fade much
less than they used to. Some printer manufacturers, Epson for one,
are also offering super-stable mineral-based inks or pigments for
their inkjet printers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many inkjet prints should last as long as, if not
longer than, traditional color film prints, according to a study by
Wilhelm Imaging Research of Grinnell, Iowa. That means, under
normal household conditions, 10 to 50 years before significant
fading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most archivists consider color images temporary,'' Weissman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Making a lasting image is only half of it.
</P>
<P>
   Robb also advises consumers to apply some professional
archivists' methods to their collections as well: cull and
organize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't try to save everything or you might get overwhelmed and
save nothing,'' he advised. ``What would you take if you had to
grab only a few
</P>
<P>
   The other trick? Save ``meta-data,'' or information about the
</P>
<P>
   ``The information on a disk might be useless if someone doesn't
understand how you've organized your file hierarchy or who is in
the picture or what they are doing,'' Robb said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL LIST OR SIDEBAR MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Across the nation, shutter clicks are giving way to the beep of
digital cameras. Shipments of digital cameras are expected to rise
more than 60 percent this year over last, according to
International Data Corp., a Framingham, Mass.-based market research
firm. The average price will drop 8 percent by year's end, compared
with a year earlier, and is expected to plunge another 16 percent
by the end of 2001, according to IDC.
</P>
<P>
   But even professional preservationists don't have foolproof ways
of ensuring that digital photos survive for the long run. Here are
tips that will improve their chances:
</P>
<P>
   1. Cull and organize. Don't try to save everything. Identify
only your best or most meaningful photos for serious preservation
and concentrate your efforts on those. Be sure to find a place to
put ``meta-data,'' such as information about how the photographs
are organized, the dates on which they were taken, and any
descriptions.
</P>
<P>
   2. Print. Make archive photos on the best-quality paper you can
afford with the most stable inks possible. Choose mineral-based
inks over organic dyes where possible. Put those copies away in
light-tight boxes. (Check this Web site for a name-brand comparison
of papers and inks: www.wilhelm-research.com/1/1.html.)
</P>
<P>
   3. Save. Optical media is the most stable and long-lasting. If
you can afford to, save your digital photos on CD-R (recordable
CD-ROM). A CD ``burner'' runs about $300. CD-R discs are only about
$2 each and hold 650 megabytes of data. Magnetic media like hard
discs, Zip discs or backup tapes are less reliable but viable
options. Whether saving on magnetic or optical media, use an
application-neutral format, such as JPEG, and try to make at least
two copies to store in different places.
</P>
<P>
   4. Migrate. Whether you store on optical or magnetic media,
you'll probably face losing your data to changes in computer
systems long before the medium itself will degrade. Mark backups
with an ``expiration date'' -- five years at the outside -- when
you will copy (or migrate) the contents to the new disc, tape or
medium of your choice. If at all possible, don't change data
compression formats. Each time a file is translated, it loses data.
Over time, the loss will cause the image to degrade. LF END WYLIE

GOP RESISTS USING SAMPLING AS CENSUS FIGHT CONTINUES 
</HEADLINE>
 -NEWHOUSE   (Attention editors: For information about purchasing this article

Syndicate at 1-732-390-4480; fax, 732-390-4697; e-mail:

 By J. SCOTT ORR  
 c.2000 Newhouse News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- The 2000 census is ahead of schedule, on budget
and mired in politics and controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an impressive string of successes since it began in
earnest on April 1, the national head count has come under
relentless attack from Republicans over a plan to adjust the
numbers to try to account for millions of Americans who were
missed.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is fair representation in the nation's state
legislatures and the House of Representatives, along with billions
of dollars in federal aid that will be doled out over the next 10
years based on census data.
</P>
<P>
   But fueling the fight are lofty political stakes that include
control of the House -- where Republicans, with a slim six-vote
majority, are worried that the adjusted numbers will wrongly boost
the count of traditional Democratic constituencies like minorities
and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans point to errors in adjusted figures in the 1990
census in arguing that the risks of using sampling techniques to
tweak the figures are just too great. They want the Census Bureau
to use only figures compiled the old-fashioned way: through
questionnaires, door-to-door canvassing and telephone interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once states draw their district lines, you can't come back a
year later and say, `Sorry. We made a mistake. We added or
subtracted too many people,' '' said Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla. As
chairman of the House subcommittee on the census, Miller is leading
the Republican fight against sampling.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about control of the House,'' said Rep. Robert
Andrews, D-N.J., who estimates that the city of Camden was
undercounted by nearly 10 percent in the 1990 census, when adjusted
numbers were calculated but not used.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican arguments have been indefensible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 census has exceeded expectations and overcome obstacles
on a number of fronts as the data collection portion of the task
winds to a close. Of the 120 million questionnaires sent out to
homes in March, 66 percent, about 78 million, were returned. That
figure is up from 65 percent in 1990, reversing a 30-year decline
in response rate.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Weeks before a self-imposed July 7 deadline, census workers had
completed surveys in 99 percent of the 42 million homes that did
not return their census questionnaires. The bureau also overcame an
expected shortage of workers, recruiting 2.6 million qualified
applicants.
</P>
<P>
   And the agency's telephone assistance program aided more than 6
million callers; more than 546,000 people took advantage of walk-in
questionnaire assistance centers.
</P>
<P>
   (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   ``I called Census 2000 `The Good Census,' and I believe that
accurately describes what the Census Bureau has achieved,'' Census
Director Kenneth Prewitt told Congress.
</P>
<P>
   However, the question of using sampling techniques to adjust
census numbers to make up for the inevitable undercount looms
heavily.
</P>
<P>
   The fight must be settled by April 1, the deadline by which the
Census Bureau must make available to state legislatures the figures
they will use to redraw legislative and congressional district
lines.
</P>
<P>
   State legislatures will then have the option of using the
unadjusted -- or enumerated -- data or the adjusted numbers, if
they are released, in redrawing district lines for the decade.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   In at least six states, legislatures are moving to ban the use
of adjusted numbers for redistricting purposes. In one of those
states, New Jersey, the state Assembly voted last month to require
the use of only enumerated data.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., the third-ranking member of the
House leadership, said House Democrats are planning a challenge to
the first such state law to pass on the grounds that it violates
constitutional guarantees of equal protection under the law.
Virginia is expected to lead the way in enacting a ban on the use
of adjusted numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt, meanwhile, has expressed confidence in the sampling
technique devised for the 2000 census and said he hopes it will
help avoid the undercounting of African-Americans and other
minorities that took place during the 1990 census.
</P>
<P>
   Without adjusting the data, he admitted, ``neither the overall
coverage, nor the differential undercount rates in Census 2000 will
show improvement over 1990.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   The sampling technique planned for the 2000 census, called the
Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation, involves the use of a separate
minicensus of 314,000 randomly selected households nationwide.
Those results will be compared with figures from the regular census
to determine factors to adjust the counts of 448 demographic
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The evaluation might determine, for example, that non-Hispanic
black males, age 18 to 29, living in their own home in a
metropolitan area where census return rates are low were
undercounted by a factor of ``x.'' That factor would then be added
to the count of all such men across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the survey will make the census more
accurate,'' said Howard Hogan, the chief of statistical design for
both the census and the evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't believe that, we wouldn't be doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Hogan said, the Census Bureau will examine its results
before deciding if the adjusted figures will be released next
spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we've run the survey, we're going to take a look at the
results and decide whether in fact it has been carried out
properly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision on whether to release adjusted figures is expected
to be made in February. The Clinton administration has drawn
criticism in recent days for its plan to push the decision making
from the secretary of the Commerce Department, which oversees the
Census Bureau, down to Prewitt.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Secretary William Daley, who subsequently left the
department to take control of Vice President Al Gore's presidential
campaign, said the decision was moved downstairs because ``politics
shouldn't play any part in this.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans saw the move as an effort on behalf of Gore to
distance the administration from a controversial census decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transferring of decision-making authority from the
commerce secretary to the Census Bureau director doesn't make the
decision to release manipulated numbers any more palatable or less
political,'' Miller said, pointing out that Prewitt was appointed
by President Clinton. ``This decision was political from the
beginning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision on releasing adjusted figures may actually be made
by voters in November. If Texas Gov. George W. Bush is elected
president, he will likely name a new commerce secretary and census
director who will block the release. JL END ORR

TURNING A CARD TRICK INTO CELEBRITY `SHUFFLE' 
</HEADLINE>
   By GRACE GLUECK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Continuing his long-running game of ``Anyone Can Be
an Artist as Long as I'm in Charge,'' Robert Rauschenberg has
unveiled his latest enterprise at the Whitney Museum of American
Art. Called ``Synapsis Shuffle,'' the new divertissement _ if one
may use that word for such a dull performance _ is a group of 52
panels, the number alluding to a full deck of cards.
</P>
<P>
   Each panel bears a characteristically disparate mix of
photographic images taken by Rauschenberg around the globe and
transferred to the panels' polylaminate surfaces. The paintinglike
photographs include objects, street scenes, people and natural
phenomena, along with snippets from advertising, magazines and
newspapers. Interspersed with abstract passages from paintings,
these seemingly stream-of-consciousness images are played off
against one another in arrangements that allow for multiple
readings on the part of the viewer. It's an old Rauschenberg idea
that has become very, very tired.
</P>
<P>
   Involved with the notion of audience participation in his art
for many years, Rauschenberg invited 12 fellow celebrities to
shuffle the panels for public presentation. That is, each was given
a chance to ``compose'' his or her own work, selecting from three
to seven of the panels and placing them in whatever juxtaposition
came to mind. A Whitney press release states portentously that
``the singular nature'' of ``Synapsis Shuffle'' dictates that its
52 components be rearranged by different people each time it is
installed, ``so that new works are continuously created from it.''
But it's a little hard to buy the premise that anyone can create a
new work simply by pushing around the artist's components.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, using the maximum of seven panels, the artist Chuck
Close selected those with images ranging from a cherub sitting on a
cornice to a tiny man on a scaffolding painting a large orange
wall. Martha Stewart, the lifestyle entrepreneur, picked three
panels that included one with a photo of elephants' rear ends
placed next to a cartoon of a giant lobster on the back of a truck.
In his five-panel arrangement, Mike Wallace, the television
journalist, included one that bore an image of a fire plug and
another showing a photograph of an American Indian brave.
</P>
<P>
   Mathilde Krim, chairwoman of the board of the American
Foundation for AIDS Research, defied convention by turning one of
her three panels back to front, so that only its bare frame shows.
The soprano Renee Fleming impishly decreed that her four panels
should appear sideways. Other shufflers included Michael Ovitz, the
talent agent and art collector; the art critic Robert Hughes; the
museum director and curator Walter Hopps; the musician and
photographer David Byrne; the choreographer Merce Cunningham; the
designer Edwin Schlossberg; and the art dealer Ileana Sonnabend.
</P>
<P>
   A long video loop displayed with the show details the selection
procedure on May 15 (at a Long Island City warehouse). It has all
the pumped-up gaiety of a celebrity fund-raiser. What's truly
amazing is how Rauschenberg managed to get this high-powered group
together in one space on one particular day to participate in this
hollow exercise. That is really the most successful accomplishment
of the show.
</P>
<P>
   It is also amazing how Rauschenberg himself has kept shuffling
the same ideas, more or less, into larger and larger projects that
take up enormous gallery space at the country's museums. He started
out as a bombshell in the early 1950s, a young, hugely talented
artist with an open, experimental approach to techniques and
materials. He anticipated the transition from Abstract
Expressionism to the emerging Pop Art movement by using
Expressionist gesture with everyday objects and images. It was a
giant, fresh leap.
</P>
<P>
   But over the years his work has sadly lapsed into some of the
most boringly predictable cliches of the art world. For the last
decade and a half he has been assembling his repertory of images
taken from here, there and everywhere around the globe, into
endless epics, like his 1984-1991 ROCI project (Rauschenberg
Overseas Cultural Interchange), covering his exposure to cultural
traditions in each of 11 countries, among them China, Mexico,
Japan, Venezuela, Cuba and others, using materials and images from
each country's culture. This giant piece was presented in full at
the National Gallery of Art in 1991 and in part at the traveling
Rauschenberg retrospective organized by the Guggenheim in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A precursor to the present ``Shuffle'' is ``The \ Mile or 2
Furlong Piece,'' a continuing extravaganza that at last count had
more than 200 painted and sculptural elements, extended more than
1,000 feet and was still growing. It was exhibited in 1987 at the
Metropolitan; 10 years later with add-ons as part of a Guggenheim
retrospective, and this year at the Massachusetts Museum of
Contemporary Art in North Adams. Like ``Furlong,'' Rauschenberg
considers ``Shuffle'' a piece ``in perpetual evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   The pretentiousness of ``Synapsis Shuffle,'' the
celebrity-kissing self-promotion it has involved, and the wasteful
allotment of nearly 6,000 square feet of gallery to it at the
space-challenged Whitney are not cause for celebration. Neither is
the sheer chutzpah of calling these hoary Rauschenberg cliches ``a
new masterwork'' and proclaiming that the participation of people
other than the artist in arranging them gives the project ``an
element of chance.'' (About as much an element of chance as in
three-card monte.)
</P>
<P>
   It won't go away: ``Shuffle'' has been promised as a gift to the
Whitney by Leonard A. Lauder, chairman of the Estee Lauder
Companies, who is also chairman of the Whitney's board, a diligent
fund-raiser for the museum and a prime donor of art and money
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Synapsis Shuffle'' turns out to be the same old Rauschenberg
deal. It's a pity that the Whitney has all but turned itself into a
Rauschenberg coliseum. It seems that as museums expand their
capacity, Rauschenberg's work expands to fill it.

   A KILLER SHARK IN RETROSPECT
</P>
<P>
   The screenwriter Carl Gottlieb tells a story about Steven
Spielberg, then a young director making ``Jaws,'' and a very small
backyard swimming pool. In the film a man's head suddenly and
shockingly appears in an underwater hulk. After the movie was shot,
the editor, Verna Fields, was working on it in her garage when
Spielberg became dissatisfied with the scene and decided to shoot
it again in Fields' pool. He would pay for it himself if need be.
</P>
<P>
   The boat remains were retrieved from the prop department and
sunk. The pool was lined with black plastic, and milk was dumped in
the water to make it opaque. An underwater cameraman descended and
kept shooting the rubber head. Eventually the studio agreed to pay
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Next week much old ``Jaws'' lore will resurface in a
25th-anniversary edition on tape (two cassettes) and DVD from
Universal. In 1975, the movie was a sensation, the first of the big
mass-audience action films that would take over the industry. In
its first two months, it brought in $90 million at the box office,
passing ``The Sting'' and ``The Exorcist'' and posing a threat to
``The Godfather'' as the biggest money-maker ever.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics were shocked at what they saw as the film's blatant
attempt to exploit and manipulate. ```Jaws' is so shabbily
constructed that audiences don't even pay attention during the
quiet intervals,'' Stephen Farber wrote in The New York Times.
``They're just waiting to see if the director can top the last
spectacular death or dismemberment.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg, as explained in a 75-minute making-of documentary on
tape and disc, was waiting for the shark. In those days the
monsters were hydraulic, not digital. ``The shark didn't work very
well,'' Gottlieb said in an interview. ``Storms trashed the
mechanism.''
</P>
<P>
   Gottlieb got the writing credit, along with Peter Benchley, on
whose novel the film was based. In an early memo to Spielberg, he
recommended losing a proposed Mafia subplot and getting rid of the
sexual tension between Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and the wife of
the police chief, Brody (Roy Scheider).
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the film, the shark had to get in the boat with
Brody and Quint (Robert Shaw), the hard-bitten captain. Until then
it was a work in progress. ``I told Steven, `If you don't have a
shark, let's shoot stuff without one,''' Gottlieb said. While the
movie has plenty of gore in the water and yellow harpoon barrels
tearing here and there along the surface, the beast rarely exposes
more than a fin and some teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our model was `The Thing,' a low-budget black-and-white
thriller,'' Gottlieb said. ``The key element there was that you
didn't see the monster, just the effects.'' Also known as ``The
Thing From Another World,'' the film, made in 1951, is regarded as
one of the best in its genre.
</P>
<P>
   Most critics now say the same about ``Jaws.'' And what's wrong
with a little manipulation? ``It's what Hitchcock did better than
anybody,'' Gottlieb said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricane
</P>
<P>
   Telling the story of Rubin (Hurricane) Carter (Denzel
Washington), Norman Jewison's stirring but schmaltzy film lands
every emotional jab and hook. Carter, the boxer who served 20 years
in prison for murder, makes a brainy advocate for his own release.
A book he writes about himself attracts a young reader (Vicellous
Reon Shannon), who in turn interests three investigators from
Canada (Liev Schreiber, John Hannah and Deborah Kara Unger) in
taking up Carter's cause. Washington is powerful, but, Stephen
Holden wrote in The New York Times, ``his performance only partly
camouflages the glaring flaws of a movie that is as blatantly
manipulative as a pep rally.''

   Boiler Room
</P>
<P>
   Beer-swilling Long Island boys in a cacophonous investment
trading room pitch customers looking for fast killings and try to
figure ways to spend all their own money. But there is a personal
story, too. Seth (Giovanni Ribisi), a college dropout and former
casino operator, strives to reconnect with his father (Ron Rifkin),
a judge who disowns him. Written and directed by the 29-year-old
Ben Younger, the film ``reflects the sensibility of the generation
it holds up to critical scrutiny, and it's a cunningly ambiguous
act of self-portraiture'' (A.O. Scott).

   Mansfield Park
</P>
<P>
   The setting in Patricia Rozema's adaptation of Jane Austen's
novel seems familiar, but her smart, politically pointed screenplay
features a protofeminist heroine and includes such modern touches
as lesbianism and blatant drug addiction. Sir Thomas Bertram
(Harold Pinter), a slave trader, rules his estate with pompous
authority while young Fanny Price (Frances O'Connor), a poor
relative who is treated like a servant, persists in a film that
``is determined to invest Austen with as many prickly resonances as
it can'' (Holden).

<P>
   My Dog Skip
</P>
<P>
   Far from the typical high-tech kiddie adventure, Jay Russell's
leisurely, beautifully atmospheric film recreates the world Willie
Morris wrote about in his book about his Mississippi childhood. The
setting is a small town during World War II, and the action strays
no farther than across the railroad tracks as a boy (Frankie Muniz)
and his pup grow up together on leafy streets and in the embrace of
loving parents (Kevin Bacon and Diane Lane). Yes, it gets gooey,
but locations and performances ``help to make the film's relentless
sentimentality more bearable than it otherwise might have been''
(Scott).

   THE AUDREY HEPBURN STORY. Wearing her hair in a huge French
twist popular in the early 1960s, Hepburn (Jennifer Love Hewitt)
shows up on the set to play Holly Golightly, a sort-of call girl,
in ``Breakfast at Tiffany's.'' Marilyn Monroe would have been
better for the part, grumbles a man who looks like Truman Capote,
author of the novella on which ``Breakfast'' is based. Roughly the
same misgivings might be expressed about Hewitt in the role of
Hepburn, who moved from a lonely upbringing to stardom on the stage
and screen. Chronicling the Hepburn career, this film, made for
ABC, never rises above its genre. But Hewitt, Anita Gates wrote in
The New York Times, at least gets Hepburn's voice right and ``is
not the disaster many people expected.'' 2000. Columbia Tri-Star.
$19.96; DVD, $24.95. 133 minutes. Closed captioned. Release date:

&HT;     STRIKING HOSPITAL WORKERS DEMAND JOB SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MICHAEL YI,  
 &HT;     MICHAEL DOUGAN and PIA SARKAR  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ One of the largest health care worker strikes in
recent history forced nine Bay Area hospitals to operate with
skeleton crews Thursday as 4,000 union members walked off their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The unions delivered on their promise of packed picket lines,
while the hospitals appeared to be handling the work shortages with
no serious problems.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Service Employees International Union Local 250 _
representing technicians, licensed vocational nurses, respiratory
therapists, clerical employees, dietary and food-service personnel
and housekeeping workers _ started picketing at 6 a.m. Thursday.
The strike was scheduled to last 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the dispute, which has been fought bitterly through
radio and television advertising, is not about wages and benefits,
but about staffing, union representatives said.
</P>
<P>
   The union charges the hospitals have not been staffing adequate
numbers of workers, often resulting in work-related injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be normal when a worker is sick, injured on the
job, that worker is replaced, but it's not the case anymore,'' said
union President Sal Rosselli. ``Our folks are frightened. ... It's
escalated the work-related accidents ... all caused by short
staffing. Our workers are being rushed.''
</P>
<P>
   The union is demanding the hospitals form committees _ made up
of workers and management _ to set staffing levels. The union also
wants better job security for its members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thinking that no matter what our wages are, what
difference does it make if they shut our facility next month?''
said Susan Zupko, a respiratory therapist at St. Mary's Medical
Center in San Francisco. ``Job security is a big issue in health
care.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical center officials criticized the strikers for leaving the
hospitals with smaller staffs for a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're having a picnic and a parade and putting patients
last,'' said Sutter Health spokesman Bill Gleeson.
</P>
<P>
   The hospitals tried to make it as easy as possible for patients
and employees who reported to work. In some hospitals, where the
cafeterias closed, workers received free food and patients were
given catered meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a crisis, no question about it,'' said Trisha Barrett, a
director in nursing for Alta Bates Medical Center. ``With nine ...
hospitals in one region ... it has a widespread effect. It's just
one day, but that could be an important day for some people.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Kemp, spokeswoman for Sutter Health's Alta Bates and
Summit medical centers, said there were no serious problems to
report, with doctors staffing all of the ``most critical areas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very heartening to see the physicians working so hard to
compensate for the staff we don't have today,'' Kemp said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, officials acknowledged the strike inconvenienced the
hospitals and their patients, and would continue to affect service.
</P>
<P>
   Alta Bates and Summit officials said they canceled elective
surgeries a week ago and that it will take a few days to get the
hospitals' schedules back in order.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no such thing as a one-day strike,'' said Maggie Gerk,
vice president for patient care at Alta Bates and Summit.
</P>
<P>
   Picketers were joined by members of the California Nurses
Association, which had approved a sympathy strike.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Moore, a CNA member who has been a nurse at Summit Medical
Center in Oakland for 22 years, said the hospital called the nurses
individually and asked them to report to work Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said she declined the invitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important to support your co-workers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the union has accused the hospitals of hoarding
profits, Harry Joel, Catholic Healthcare West's vice president of
human resources and chief negotiator for the hospitals, said that
was not the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we break even, we're happy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Joel added the management has a contract offer on the table,
including 12 percent pay increase over four years plus added health
and pension benefits, but the union hasn't responded.
</P>
<P>
   Strikers also said wages weren't the prime issue _ one of the
few things both sides seem to agree on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here because we're fighting for safe staffing and
patient rights,'' said Deborah Covington, who works at Summit in
the food service area and is the chief shop steward there. ``Sutter
has gobbled many hospitals in the Bay Area. They care about
profits.''

   HOLLYWOOD _ The unexpected success of ``American Pie'' last
summer, in which a fresh crop of young actors obsessed about losing
their virginity and an apple pie was rudely disturbed in the
process, has accelerated the trend toward vulgar,
borderline-tasteless comedy that has some shaking their heads. How
low will Hollywood go to lure young people into theaters? The most
recent flurry of tsk-tsking occurred with the release of ``Me,
Myself and Irene,'' a Jim Carrey comedy that pokes fun at mental
illness and the disabled and does brazen things to a cow and a
chicken.
</P>
<P>
   But a fresh wave of scorn may well greet the release Friday of
``Scary Movie,'' a gleefully over-the-top satire of teen-slasher
flicks including the ``Scream'' series and ``I Know What You Did
Last Summer.'' The film, directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans, focuses
less on the horror aspects than the sexual ones and includes digs
at ``The Sixth Sense,'' ``The Usual Suspects'' and a host of more
mainstream films. No baked goods or poultry were violated in the
making of the film, but there are plenty of sex scenes, sex talk,
sex satire and pot-smoking, and one particularly rude, up-the-dress
shot that involves prosthetics of a type not seen since Mark
Wahlberg unzipped in ``Boogie Nights'' in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do our bad taste in good taste,'' promised Bob Weinstein,
one of the brothers who runs Miramax Films, distributors of both
the ``Scream'' series and this satire. ``What you do is you look at
the barometer of where the other guys have gone and then you try to
go a little further. The bottom line is, if it's funny, it stays;
if it's not, it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the pre-release tracking _ a series of surveys to monitor
audience awareness of a movie _ that precedes the opening of
virtually every new film in Hollywood these days, ``Scary Movie''
has been doing very well, indicating that there is a good deal of
pent-up demand to see the film. (That is, if the polling is
correct, which it isn't always; last week ``The Patriot'' was
tracking much better than ``The Perfect Storm,'' yet the latter did
twice as well at the box office over the holiday weekend.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tracking through the roof,'' Weinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about tracking is almost pathological in Hollywood these
days, despite its spotty history. It gives marketing executives
some idea of how well their campaigns are working and has a jargon
all its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 15 percent overall first choice a week before the
release,'' Weinstein said. ``And in the quadrants, the news is even
better. For males under 14, we're 24 percent; for females in that
age group, we're 29. For the same two categories, `Perfect Storm'
was 9 and 9. For all teen-agers, `Patriot' was 9, `Perfect Storm'
was 5. We're 34.''
</P>
<P>
   And unlike the two big holiday films, which had budgets of more
than $100 million, ``Scary Movie'' was made for a relatively
minuscule $19 million and makes no effort to disguise the fact.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Miramax intended to open the film in about 2,000
theaters, wedged two weeks after the release of the Carrey movie
and three weeks before the release of Eddie Murphy in ``Nutty
Professor 2: The Klumps.'' As some summer films have faltered,
especially during a late-June slump at the box office, Miramax has
grown more aggressive about expanding the movie's release.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we'll be on close to 4,000 screens,'' Weinstein said.
``We picked up 800 in the last two weeks alone. Basically, based on
this tracking, we're taking any theater we can get.''
</P>
<P>
   CAMP FOR 60-YEAR-OLDS
</P>
<P>
   Harry Shearer sat in the crowded set in Hollywood _ meant to
resemble a television station's control booth _ surrounded by the
bare-bones crew of a new movie he has written and is directing. In
the scene, Howard Hesseman, remembered by many as the disc jockey
Johnny Fever on the 1970s television series ``WKRP in Cincinnati,''
is playing a television producer trying to work out the details of
a new commercial for adult diapers. Shearer, tugged at his Spy
magazine T-shirt as he watched the scene unfold.
</P>
<P>
   The film, ``Call o' the Glen,'' is from a script Shearer began
six or seven years ago, he said, and is based on his fascination
with Bohemian Grove, the super-private power retreat in Northern
California where leaders from business and politics regularly
gather in a kind of summer-camp bonding experience. Famous for
guarding the privacy of its powerful guests and for forcing them to
do some of their own cooking and cleaning, the whole idea seemed
ripe for satire, said Shearer, who was actually invited to visit
the camp while he was doing research for the script. ``There is
just something that seems so goofy and sweet about men 60 and up
reliving their sophomore days at college,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Hesseman and Shearer (who plays the camp's chief cook),
the cast includes TV series survivors like Morgan Fairchild, George
Wendt, Alan Thicke, Kenneth Mars, Henry Gibson, Kurtwood Smith and
Ming-Na. It is being shot on newfangled digital cameras for a
budget of less than $600,000 by Visionbox Pictures, a new
production company hoping to exploit this less expensive digital
technology that theoretically will make it possible to make more
movies more cheaply. The entire shooting schedule is three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, Shearer said, is to take his time editing the film but
to try to have it ready for the festival circuit, perhaps as early
as the Sundance festival in January, and from there, to attract a
theatrical distributor. ``I knew this was a picture that no one
could really understand until they saw the performances,'' he said.
``You can't just read the script; you have to see Kenny Mars
reading the line. So we're hoping we'll get a better price by
presenting distributors with a finished film than by selling off
the rights beforehand to raise production money.''
</P>
<P>
   Shearer has been a steady presence in radio, television and
films for a quarter-century, as a regular on ``Saturday Night
Live'' in the late 1970s and early '80s, one of the writers and
stars of Rob Reiner's classic 1984 rockumentary, ``This Is Spinal
Tap,'' and one of the main voice-over artists behind ``The
Simpsons.'' In recent years, he has made a kind of cottage industry
out of playing fatuous television journalists, including a
talk-show moderator in last year's ``EdTV'' and, in 1998, an
interviewer in ``The Truman Show'' and a bone-headed anchorman in
``Godzilla.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Call o' the Glen'' script is one of just two he has
rattling around in his desk. He said he shies away from churning
out scripts for recreation or in hopes of raising his odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I refuse to have more than two unproduced scripts at any one
time,'' Shearer said. ``I feel that my role in life is not to
produce something that will only end up as decoration in some
agent's office.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Unseasonably cool air will plunge into New England on Friday as
low pressure slides southward from Quebec. Puffy clouds will
proliferate in the afternoon as air heated near the ground ascends
into chilly air. A few light showers will dampen the high ground of
interior New England. Farther south and west, high pressure will
bring mostly sunny skies to the Great Lakes, northern Middle
Atlantic States and Ohio Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Exceptional heat will occupy the central and southern Plains as
abundant sun propels temperatures past 100 degrees in many places.
Potent thunderstorms will erupt in the northern Plains and upper
Mississippi Valley near the edge of the hot air as a jet stream
disturbance intercepts a conveyor belt of humid air.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, clouds and a few claps of mountain thunder will
accompany low pressure moving into Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: DELAYED HEAT
</P>
<P>
   Summery heat has been slow to come to Indianapolis, where the
temperatures has not yet reached 90 degrees this year. The average
date of the first 90 degree reading in the city is June 12, and
during a typical summer, the mercury reaches or exceeds 90 degrees
on 18 days. Heat has been suppressed, in part, because ample rain
since early June has kept the ground and vegetation moist. Part of
the sun's energy has been used to evaporate the moisture rather
than heat the air.

   CHECHNYA _ SHATILI, Republic of Georgia _ Destroying the

that the war in Chechnya is over, Chechen rebel leaders have
launched a new round of deadly attacks on the Russian army.
Throughout the 10-month-old war, the rebels have evaded Russian
attacks by holing up in secretive headquarters in the snow-capped
Caucausus mountains and escaping over the porous border with
Georgia. New evidence shows that rebels are taking refuge in
Georgia, while the Kremlin has undertaken a handful of incursions
into Georgian territory itself, threatening to turn what Moscow has
called a ``domestic conflict'' into a regional one. (Coker, Cox

   KOSOVO-REFUGEES (Pristina, Kosovo) _ Kosovo's capital today is a
chaotic noisy town, but the hubbub scarcely speaks of solution of
Kosovo's many problems: A year after the end of the war here, chaos
and dislocation continue, manifested in the doubling or even
tripling of the population of this ramshackle town, now home to
more than half a million people. Mostly people from the villages,
they are refugees who have abandoned their burned out homes and
have sought work and shelter in the capital. The Kosovo war forced
about two-thirds of the province's 2 million people from their
homes. Hundreds of thousands remain displaced, living in tents and
shacks in villages, in drab and despondent refugee centers in
towns, or doubled up with relatives in cramped and unhealthy
surroundings in the cities. By Carlotta Gall.

   MIDEAST-TALKS (Jerusalem) _ There is a go-for-broke quality to
the Israeli and American approach to the coming Camp David peace
summit, which starts Tuesday with the stated goal of ending a
52-year-old blood-steeped conflict. But for the Palestinians, whose
participation is more reluctant, there is at best an aspiration
that the three-way, retreat-style meeting will serve as a stop-gap
measure to keep alive the stalemated peace process so that a
partial deal can be achieved by September. A news analysis by

   WEB-B2B-ANTITRUST (Washington) _ As companies in practically
every industry rush to join business-to-business exchanges on the
Internet, regulators are growing concerned that they will face a
rash of new antitrust questions for which they are not prepared.
Known as B2B Web sites, these business-to-business exchanges create
a place for companies in the same industry, be it automobiles or
grain, to buy and sell goods, potentially saving millions of
dollars in back-office costs by setting up a national marketplace
online. By David Leonhardt.

   INTERNET-HIGHSCHOOL (Weaverville, Calif.) _ When it learned last
year that a private company was offering college-level Advanced
Placement courses over the Web, the lone high school in this remote
gold-rush town thought it had finally discovered a perfect way to
mine the genuine academic potential of the Internet. It took the
Clinton administration up on its pledge that there was educational
salvation in new technology, and that the Web could help the
poorest schools approximate the offerings of the wealthiest. But so
far the results here and elsewhere have been ragged, suggesting
that a computer can be a crude substitute for a live teacher,
particularly when the students are so young, the stakes for them
are so high and the technology is so new. By Jacques Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   COURT-FAMILIES (New York) _ They fill the courtrooms and
hallways of the city's courthouses each day. In some cases they
arrive in force: siblings, children, friends, all there to show
support for a loved one. In other instances, they are women who
arrive alone, a solitary mother, wife or girlfriend there to
support a scorned defendant or bring to life a murder victim. They
are the families of accused criminals and crime victims, and they
are all in some form of mourning. They often display remarkable
grace and loyalty, but in just as many instances, those families
that show up show a more fallible side. Fights break out.
Relationships in the process of coming apart unravel completely in
public. Still, the families who fill the courthouses in ever
increasing numbers are not anonymous, and they very often have
impact _ great and modest _ in the outcomes of the trials they have
come to witness. By David Rohde.

A STRANGER IN A CROWD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass., Pa., Mich., France, Britain, the Netherlands)   By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Despite a reputation for antisocial behavior (the
episode of the amputated earlobe looms large), Vincent van Gogh was
a people person. He was an avid talker and letter writer, fluent in
four languages. Early in his short life he held a series of
face-the-public jobs, as an apprentice art dealer, a schoolteacher
and an evangelical preacher.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as an artist in Paris, he met practically everyone in the
avant-garde and had visions of establishing an artists' colony in
Provence; ``the school of the south,'' he called it. Only toward
the end, when mental illness closed in, did he become isolated, and
even then he bonded with his doctor, Paul Gachet, who, the artist
noted solicitously, was even more of a nervous wreck than he was.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gogh is surrounded by people, and very much part of the
crowd, in ``Van Gogh: Face to Face,'' a show devoted to his
portraits, at the Museum of Fine Arts here. Among the 80 entries
are paintings and drawings of friends and neighbors, lovers and
strangers, and repeatedly, magnetically, of the artist himself.
</P>
<P>
   No career is better known than his, and textbook icons abound
here, along with less familiar fare, including a series of
seldom-traveled early drawings from the Netherlands. There are also
notable omissions, of paintings too well known not to be missed,
which may be why the show feels somewhat patchy and unresolved. Put
the blame on supply and demand. With a spate of van Gogh
exhibitions poised to hit the boards soon, the international loan
situation must be tight.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever one's gripes, van Gogh is van Gogh; there is no one
like him. He fills whatever room he's in. At his best and worst _
both are represented here _ he is transfixing. In portraiture, a
genre that he was particularly attracted to, he is unsurpassed.
</P>
<P>
   He had complex views about what it meant, though. He disparaged
photographic accuracy. But he also kept himself a step removed from
unbridled psychological scrutiny. Predisposed to view the world
through a moralist's eye, he often treated the people he painted,
including himself, as types, actors in an emblematic drama called
life.
</P>
<P>
   For him that drama seems to have begun smoothly enough. The
child of a middle-class Dutch Reformed minister, he was an
appealing youth: a carrot-top with shapely lips, intense small eyes
and an alert, bookish temperament. At 16 he landed a position in an
art gallery in the Hague specializing in high-quality
reproductions. He did well there and was transferred to the
company's London branch.
</P>
<P>
   In London something went wrong. He fell in love, was rebuffed
and grew morose. He started reading the Bible and became obsessed
with John Bunyan's 17th-century inspirational allegory ``The
Pilgrim's Progress.'' This book, rooted in nonconformist
working-class theology, helped persuade him that his future lay in
missionary work among the poor.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to a down-and-out coal-mining village in Belgium, where
he taught the Gospel, nursed the sick and drew portraits of the
miners. After a run-in with the local church, he decided to channel
his energies into art, following the example of the French painter
Jean-Francois Millet (1814-75), who had made peasant life his
subject.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston exhibition _ organized by George T.M. Shackelford of
the Museum of Fine Arts, George S. Keyes of the Detroit Institute
of Arts and Joseph J. Rishel of the Philadelphia Museum of Art _
begins at this point, around 1881, when van Gogh, in his late 20s,
had returned to the Hague to begin his new career.
</P>
<P>
   He had been looking at all kinds of art for years, from Dutch
old master paintings to English popular engravings. He now set out
on a crash course in self-education as a draftsman by copying
pictures from student manuals and drawing the figure from life.
</P>
<P>
   With no money for professional models, he asked elderly
pensioners in the city to sit for him. His drawings of them fill
the first room of the show, and they're strange, at once bland and
overly expressive, closer to caricatures than to portraits. That
makes sense given that van Gogh's ambition at the time to find work
as a magazine illustrator specializing in social realism.
</P>
<P>
   The didactic impulse also marks his portraits of Sien Hoornick,
a seamstress and former prostitute with whom he lived. She never
looks the same twice. In one drawing she's a proletarian heroine in
a prim white cap; in another, Melancholy personifed in a Morticia
Addams dress. His sketches of her young daughter _ a feral,
tousled-haired imp _ are far more direct and alive.
</P>
<P>
   This phase culminated in the 1885 painting ``The Potato
Eaters,'' which is not in the show. Van Gogh feared that the
picture, with its lumpish, simian figures, would be taken as a
cartoon version of peasant life. And when it met with general
antipathy, he knew he had to change course.
</P>
<P>
   So he went to Paris, where a new kind of art was being made. He
stayed for two years, met many painters _ Gauguin,
Toulouse-Lautrec, Seurat, Pissarro _ and learned from all of them.
He also began the series of self-portraits that form the emotional
core of his output.
</P>
<P>
   The seven in the show are worth the price of admission: They're
like a dramatic monologue with quick-change roles and hairpin
shifts in tone and mood. In three pictures from 1887 he is
successively a shy peasant in a straw hat, an urban swell in a
nubby tweed suit, and a grave, apparitional being with
creme-de-menthe eyes who seems to be dissolving in clouds of
jewel-like pointillist paint. Finally self-exoticizing reaches an
audacious extreme in a slightly later painting in which van Gogh
presents himself as a tonsured Buddhist monk.
</P>
<P>
   This self-portrait dates from 1888, when, feeling badly strung
out, he left Paris for Arles in the south of France. There he
experienced his own private golden age. He was joined by Gauguin.
Van Gogh's art opened up. The richest concentration of portraits
date from this year.
</P>
<P>
   Among the best were those of a single family, the Roulins:
Joseph, a local postman; his wife, Augustine; and their three
children. He painted each several times, and 17 likenesses have
been brought together for a reunion here.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gogh loved these people, and he gave them starring roles in
his gallery of moral portraits. He compared Joseph, with his
luxuriant beard and tippler's cheeks, to Socrates and depicted him
as an exemplary upright man of the people, sitting face forward, at
attention, as if about to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Augustine is assigned the archetypal maternal role: she's a
placid, silent monument. Here again children escape typecasting:
Armand, 16, just looks like a moodily teen-agerish Cool; Camille,
10, is a scamp in a mushroom-shaped beret; the infant Marcelle, in
one of the artist's wittiest portraits, is a squalling, colicky
little monstrosity, truly fit to be tied.
</P>
<P>
   The stay at Arles ended in disaster: mental collapse,
self-mutilation, a ruptured friendship with Gauguin. Van Gogh was
whisked off to an asylum in nearby St. Remy, and turned out some
awesome paintings there. But the path was downhill, and that's how
the show feels. From this point on it's art as psychodrama.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Further breakdowns brought him to Gachet in Auvers, near Paris.
Van Gogh seemed to perk up a bit there; he painted ``Starry
Night.'' But the portraits _ apart from one of a sweet, sleepy-eyed
gardener and those of Gachet himself, represented only by a couple
of etchings in Boston _ are pathetic: maladroit depictions of
robotic adults and Munchkin-like children. The denouement came
soon. Alone in a field, van Gogh shot himself and died two days
later.
</P>
<P>
   His reputation not only survived him but also grew,
tremendously. The exhibition catalog demonstrates his influence on
figurative painters from Matisse to Chuck Close. The current vogue
for portraiture owes everything to the artist who gave the genre
its modern form.
</P>
<P>
   The very look of his paintings _ with their cable-knit textures,
Rajput colors and surreal versions of real things _ defines modern
art for many viewers. But van Gogh is modern as much for what he
was as for what he did. His art and his life are inseparable.
</P>
<P>
   He gave us our first complete visual record of an ego dying in
public; we watch it over and over, like a documentary video of a
disaster. He's our first celebrity martyr, the patron saint of our
cult of disability. He's that most contemporary of tragic heroes,
the blameless victim of the self. We line up for exhibitions of his
work to look at great art, which even flawed shows deliver, but
also to spend some quality time in his charismatically star-crossed
company.

 &HT;    Internet site helps former Athens High students hook up and play
catch-up with old friends
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Michael Barnett sends e-mails to ``the first girl I
ever kissed'' 38 years ago. He's pals with his old flame's
boyfriend, who doesn't know that the woman in question and the
52-year-old Barnett once shared a memory and are talking again _
via a Web site for Athens High School, Athens, Ga., which ceased to
exist in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Athenshigh.com was the brainchild of Bobby Prince, 55, of
Venice, Fla., who graduated from AHS in 1963 and created the site
for all members of the classes of 1927 through 1970 to reconnect
with old friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like a visit home to a past that has been lost,'' says
Barnett, an official with the state Department of Corrections in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Prince, a professional musician, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone ever has friends as close as those of
their childhood,'' he says. ``Adults usually cannot open up to one
another and take risks like children can. The site equalizes the
ground for everyone, unlike in high school where the most popular
kids received the lion's share of attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The site provides names, phone numbers, street and e-mail
addresses, personal comments, photos, a list of 20 Athens, Ga.,
boys who died in Vietnam, announcements and questions, such as ``do
you know where Betty Lou is,'' and links to information about
upcoming reunions. With a mouse click, users can even listen to the
Athens High fight song.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 1,200 people have registered at the AHS site, and the
number grows by 20 a week. It's averaging 1,300 hits a day.
</P>
<P>
   The site has even been a boon to reunion committees. Last week,
a reunion of the classes of '50 through '70 drew a capacity crowd,
thanks mainly to the Web site, says Frances Hoge Harper of Athens
who graduated in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard from a classmate named Jimmy Ashley,'' says Harper, of
Athens. ``He was so funny. He said, `Tell me what you've been doing
for the past 40 years.' We weren't even good friends then, but now,
what's great is that everybody is like a cousin to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Interest in Web sites for those who want to reconnect reflects a
burgeoning trend, especially among baby boomers, to find others who
came of age during the '60s. People 50 and older account for 23
million of the 132 million Americans who use the Net, the largest
of any age segment, according to Jupiter Communications, a net
research firm in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   So the Net is loaded with people finders, many with message
boards, like the AHS site and the Virtual Wall
(thevirtualwall.org). New sites pop up daily, now numbering in the
hundreds or thousands. Some cost nothing, but many charge fees. A
few will dig up almost any kind of info _ such as an FBI file on a
neighbor _ for fees up to $500. They offer the advantage of the
Internet's warp speed, with links to databases. There's even a site
for now-grown kids who moved every few years with their parents
from one military base to another.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 40,000 registered `brats,''' says Vann Baker, 43, who
runs Military Brats Online in Atlanta. ``There's a growing desire
to reconnect, and if you can go online and find an alumni group,
that's a good starting point.''
</P>
<P>
   Social changes since ``Leave It to Beaver'' days have dispersed
old chums, and hectic lifestyles keep most boomers too busy to form
bonds with neighbors or colleagues. Plus there's the tug of
mortality.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be a vast conspiracy to keep us isolated from
one another,'' says Michael Dean Murphy, an anthropology professor
at the University of Alabama. ``This produces great nostalgia for
the intense, multifaceted friendships of our younger days. The
American high school is just the kind of medium in which intense
relationships can form.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are feeling our mortality, which forces us to look back to
a time when our whole lives were still in front of us,'' says
Gerald Celente, head of the Trends Research Institute in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy says millions of boomers have turned into ``cyber
gumshoes'' in the past few years. The Web offers them an anonymous
way to be nosy and to see who married whom, who's divorced, who's
dead, who made it financially and who didn't.
</P>
<P>
   The Net also has proved a boon in finding family members for
reunions. Farley Daniel-Cottrell of Athens began researching her
family names of Maxwell, Audley and Couper on line and soon found
cousins stretched from Florida to Texas. Some 75 descendants of the
families that had once resided along the Georgia coast gathered on
St. Simons Island last month to meet each other and explore family
history. They toured old homesteads and gathered for a picnic,
where bagpipers provided the entertainment as an homage to their
Scottish roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just fell into place,'' said Daniel-Cottrell. ``We even had
a couple from Canada come to meet the 'American' Maxwells.''
</P>
<P>
   The net has fostered connections for such diverse folks as:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Jennifer McCormick, 22, of Sterling, Va., who had been
separated from her father since her parents divorced 20 years ago.
Three weeks ago, her husband contacted US Search.com, and knowing
only her dad's Social Security number found the right guy. When he
heard from her via email, Richard McILvenna, 50, says ``it blew me
away. I'd just accepted she was gone forever.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Thomas Marr, a 71-year-old Emory University law professor, who
used the Net to return a canteen once owned by a now-dead GI held
as a prisoner of war in Japan. He'd inherited the relic from his
dad. The only marking on the canteen was a name, Minini, scratched
on its side with a nail. Then he found in his late father's papers
a reference to a Carlo A. Minini. Using geneology software, Marr
found Minini's widow Bertha in Gallup, N.M. ``I looked up Carlo
Minini and there he was, with an address and a telephone number his
widow had never changed. So I called her, then mailed it. She was
very grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Rev. Ron Baskin of St. David Episcopal Church in Roswell,
who posted a message on the Virtual Wall (thevirtualwall.org)
trying to find friends he served with in Vietnam. Baskin, 71, who
became a priest after the war, found one close buddy, and ``it felt
great, special. You have a closeness and it's great to be able to
do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Vietnam vets use the Virtual Wall to search for buddies,
says Alan Greilsamer of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, which
built the Wall in Washington. So do relatives of men who died, such
as Grace Walsh, 43, of Boston, who posted a message asking for
anyone who knew her brother to respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard back immediately by email from my brother's lieutenant
who was with him the day he died. He said he'd always wanted to get
in touch. It's brought as much peace to him as it has to us.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, ex-Lt. A.T. ``Doc'' Stevens, 53, of Baker, La., met
Walsh at Atlanta's Hartsfield Airport and the two drove to her
mother's home in South Carolina. She also met Atlantan Ray Barnwell
at the airport, who was in her brother's unit, too.
</P>
<P>
   It's been cathartic for all concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grace was my saving grace,'' Stevens says.
</P>
<P>
   But many have used the net to recapture happier times.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Terry Vennes, a '62 Athens grad who lives in
Lawrenceville, for example, made contact with her best high school
chum, Emily Hoge Waldron, now of Richboro, Pa., after three
decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like the years have just fallen away, and I am so
grateful to be reconnected with old friends,'' says Vennes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have taken up where we left off some 30 years ago.''
Waldron says. ``We email each other at least twice a week and find
instead of discussing which boy we are now dating, we discuss how
to deal with aging parents and news of our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Prince says, ``This site has shown me that the Internet is far
from impersonal.'' It's a point well illustrated by Barnett, whose
journey on the Net helped him rekindle memories of that first
smooch, long before Athens High became Clarke Central after it was
consolidated with an all-black high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was at one of the dances at the YMCA when I was 13 or 14,''
he says. ``Guys don't forget things like that.''

 &HT;    Women hold heavy advantage in overall health
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Women continue to lead the way in healthier lifestyles over men
by smoking and drinking less and wearing seat belts more often.
</P>
<P>
   But they still don't exercise as often as men, results from a
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention national telephone
survey found. The survey, with more than 100,000 adult Americans
polled in 50 states, was conducted in 1996 and 1997; results were
released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and public health educators use the results as a
barometer for how Americans are doing _ or not doing _ in efforts
to keep healthy and avoid the big killers: heart disease, cancer,
diabetes and other chronic diseases. Researchers said they found no
surprises in the latest survey that has been conducted since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, the categories of overweight and obesity have gone
up in all states, all genders and all races,'' said Deborah
Holtzman, epidemiologist with the CDC's Chronic Disease Prevention
&AMP; Health Promotion center. ``But we knew that would be a trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, about 61 percent of men and 44 percent of
women reported being overweight, even though men were slightly more
likely than women to engage in leisure-time physical activity.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia in 1997, almost 10 percent more women reported being
overweight than the previous year, from 40 percent to 49 percent.
Some 69 percent of Georgia men described themselves as overweight
in 1997, up from 66 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, 300,000 Americans die prematurely because of being
overweight and not getting any exercise, second only to
tobacco-related deaths, according to the CDC.
</P>
<P>
   In a report released last October that included some of the
1996-1997 telephone survey data, the agency labeled obesity an
epidemic, holding the same potentially deadly threat as an
infectious disease. In that report, Georgia had the weightiest
problem of all states with a whopping 101 percent increase in
overall obesity among its residents from 1991 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone survey also found that more men than women in
Georgia smoked cigarettes, 25 percent to 20 percent, and that three
times as many men as women reported binge drinking, defined as five
or more drinks on one occasion (15 percent of men and 4 percent of
women).
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, more men than women reported going in for
colon-cancer screening, while women were more likely to have their
blood cholesterol checked.

PRICE OF OIL FALLS TO $29.99 A BARREL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER BARRETT   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The price of crude oil continued to fall Thursday, slipping
below $30 a barrel on growing expectations that Saudi Arabia will
help stabilize oil prices in the near future by pumping as much as
a half-million more barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   While the benchmark August oil future contract managed to stay
above the $30 threshold on Wednesday, it slipped as low as $29.80
midday Thursday before rebounding somewhat, ending trading down 68
cents, or 2.2 percent, at $29.99 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil for August delivery fell 5.6 percent on Wednesday, the
first day of New York oil trading after Saudi Arabia, OPEC's top
producer, said it would increase its production in an effort to
reign in rapidly rising oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   With the cost of crude oil falling, industry analysts expect
gasoline prices at the pump to fall as well. Retail gas prices have
already declined 20 cents a gallon over the past two weeks in the
Midwest, after climbing above $2 earlier this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Midwest gasoline problem has been resolved -- for now at
least -- thanks to market forces,'' UBS Warburg said on Thursday,
adding that further declines in gasoline prices are likely if Saudi
Arabia carries through with its announcement to increase
production. If supply increases as expected, the investment firm
predicted gasoline would drop a little lower ``on both the
political radar screen and in the headlines.''
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline for August delivery is down 4 cents, or 4.2 percent, at
92 cents down almost 9 cents over the last two days.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC has already increased capacity under an agreement reached
last month. The group raised its output ceiling by about 3 percent
to 25.4 million barrels a day starting July 1. The agreement
included all OPEC members except Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The latest OPEC agreement represented an increase of about
708,000 barrels in the daily quota. However, the actual increase in
production is expected to be much lower -- by some estimates, just
300,000 extra barrels a day -- as many OPEC members were already
exceeding their production quotas, producing at or near capacity
before the new agreement went into effect.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC production last month was an estimated 733,000 barrels a
day above the quotas established by the cartel in March, according
to a survey by Dow Jones. Saudi Arabia produced 8.241 million
barrels a day of crude oil in June, up from the 8.098 million
barrels a day the previous month, and more than 200,000 barrels a
day above the output target established in March, according to the
survey.
</P>
<P>
   After the close of futures trading Wednesday, the American
Petroleum Institute reported that U.S. crude oil inventories for
the week ended June 30, fell 136,000 barrels, to 293 million
barrels -- down 34.3 million barrels from the comparable period a
year earlier. But gasoline inventory jumped 2.2 million barrels,
helping to increase the total U.S. inventory of crude oil and
refined products by 1.4 million barrels, to 775.1 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
   In light of the increase in the gasoline stock and Saudi
Arabia's recent announcement, Paul Chang, a Lehman Brothersanalyst,
reported Thursday that he expected the short-term trading direction
for petroleum will be down. His firm projects crude oil prices will
stabilize in the second half of the year, averaging about $27 a
barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, has been a vocal
proponent of boosting capacity in order to stabilize oil prices,
with the goal of bringing the price within a range of $22 to $28 a
barrel.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudis are moving to curb the high oil prices into a more
desirable range, but we still think they will hold in the
mid-20s,'' Christopher Moore, a Merrill Lynchanalyst, said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Merrill Lynch announced it had revised its oil
price forecast up to $26 a barrel in the third quarter, from $23 a
barrel, and raised the full-year forecast to $26.75 a barrel, from
$25.50 to reflect better-than-expected oil prices and U.S. refining
margins for the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have left a little bit of a cushion,'' Moore said. ``We've
allowed for oil prices to ease.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore said the drop in the stock prices of oil companies
following Saudi Arabia's announcement was temporary. Merrill Lynch
expects oil sector companies to report earnings for the quarter
ending in June at or slightly better than consensus expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday afternoon, many of the oil companies' stock prices
had rebounded from the previous day, with ExxonMobil (XOM:NYSE)
finished up 1 1/4, or nearly 2 percent, at 78 3/16, and Sunoco
(SUN:NYSE), gained about 9/16, or 2 percent, at 29 1/16. Shares of
Phillips Petroleum (P:NYSE) gained 2 7/8, or almost 6 percent, to
close at 50 1/8. Merrill Lynch upgraded Phillips on Wednesday to
near-term accumulate rating from a near-term neutral rating.

UPDATE: MARRIOTT TOPS ESTIMATES BY 2 CENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIM ARANGO   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hotel operator Marriott International (MAR:NYSE) beat Wall
Street estimates when it reported second-quarter earnings Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The company reported earnings per share of 50 cents for the
three-month period that ended June 16, up 2 cents from the Wall
Street consensus of 48 cents, according to First Call/Thomson
Financial, and up 19 percent from the 42 cents a share reported in
the comparable period last year.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter, net income rose 11 percent over last year's
second quarter, to $126 million from $113.5 million. Sales for the
quarter totaled $2.4 billion, a 17 percent jump from the $2.05
billion in the second quarter of 1999. Systemwide sales -- which
include sales of managed and franchised properties -- grew 13
percent, to $4.8 billion from $4.25 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the Washington, D.C.-based company highlighted
strong demand in New York, Boston, San Francisco and Hong Kong. The
gains reflect both increases in room rates and occupancy.
</P>
<P>
   Marriott added 227 hotels and timeshare resorts to its lodging
portfolio over the past 12 months. During the quarter, Marriott
announced an agreement to sell 10 extended stay and select service
hotels for $145 million while retaining long-term management
agreements. Eight of the hotels were sold during the quarter for
approximately $90 million. The remaining two hotels are expected to
be sold by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue per available room, a key statistic in the hotel
business, increased 7.6 percent over last year's second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   William Crow, an analyst at Raymond James &AMP; Associates who
follows Marriott, expected revenue per available room to rise 4
percent to 5 percent. ``What we are seeing is huge demand on the
consumer side for hotel rooms,'' he said. He said the increase is a
reflection of both the health of the economy and Marriott's strong
portfolio of brands, which includes Ritz Carlton and Marriott
Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Crow did not raise his year-end earnings estimates, although he
said the potential exists for Marriott to exceed expectations in
the final two quarters of the fiscal year. He did, however, raise
his rating to a strong buy to a buy Thursday and increased his
12-month target price for Marriott stock to 44 from 39.
</P>
<P>
   Marriott's earnings bode well for other hotel operators set to
release earnings in the coming weeks, especially those with strong
assets in the Northeast and on the West Coast, he said.
Specifically, he is looking for robust growth from Starwood Hotels
and Resorts (HOT:NYSE), which operates Sheraton and Westin, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   Crow similarly raised his rating on Starwood to a strong buy
from a buy and his 12-month price target to 40 from 35. Starwood is
scheduled to release quarterly earnings Aug. 7. Crowe's firm has
not performed underwriting for either Marriott or Starwood.

 &HT;    GORE TELLS TEACHERS BETTER SCHOOLS WILL LEAD TO HIGHER PAY
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Vice President Al Gore repeatedly brought delegates
and guests to their feet as he outlined his education agenda
Thursday at the annual convention of the National Education
Association.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democratic hopeful also irritated some of them by
predicting that higher pay for teachers will require visible
improvements in the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people are not going to lift the compensation for
teachers if they feel they aren't getting more than they're getting
now,'' Gore told the 2.5-million-member group, which includes 1.8
million active teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Several teachers said after his speech that Gore seemed to be
signalling that _ like Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican
hopeful _ he had refused to rule out reliance on merit pay or
performance-based pay for teachers and other public school
employees. In the past, Gore has endorsed a limited experiment in
Denver with performance-based pay for teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Revelling in the warm reception from delegates who had endorsed
him 7,553 to 889 in a secret-ballot vote on the Fourth of July,
Gore inspired many rounds of applause as he itemized the main
features of his education agenda without mentioning its price tag
of $115 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Summing up his views, he said he favors bringing a populist
``revolution to our schools, treating teachers like the
professionals that they are, reducing class sizes, modernizing our
classrooms and connecting them to the Internet, (and) giving
teachers the training and the professional development
opportunities that are needed.''
</P>
<P>
   But after the euphoria wore off, some NEA members said they were
miffed by the way in which Gore qualified his support for raising
the pay of teachers to the level of other professionals in other
fields with the same education and hours of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like he wasn't admitting that we already aren't
being paid enough now,'' said Lianne R. Bennett, a 7th-grade
language arts teacher in Medford, N.J. ``But I don't suppose the
other gentleman (Bush) is any better on performance-based pay, so I
guess we're stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Sullivan, a Bush campaign spokesman, said later that, while
Bush hasn't explicitly endorsed linking the pay of individual
teachers to their performances, he advocates local control, ``which
would let localities choose to do that, if they decide that's best
in their locality.''
</P>
<P>
   Linking performance to pay is a touchy issue with teachers in
the NEA. The day before Gore spoke, the convention turned down a
suggestion by its reform faction that it allow local affiliates to
negotiate such agreements with their districts.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two hours before Gore spoke, the convention
overwhelmingly adopted a resolution that satisfied both reformers
and traditionalists.
</P>
<P>
   The two-sentence policy statement said: ``NEA shall not promote
or in any way advocate merit pay or pay for performance. If,
however, an affiliate should be forced to negotiate or accept a
merit pay or pay for performance plan, the NEA shall provide
assistance to that local to protect the rights and benefits of its
members and will work to insure that any such proposed plan will
not be adopted unless agreed to by that local.''

 &HT;    GORE TELLS TEACHERS BETTER SCHOOLS WILL LEAD TO HIGHER PAY
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Vice President Al Gore repeatedly brought delegates
and guests to their feet as he outlined his education agenda
Thursday at the annual convention of the National Education
Association.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democratic hopeful also irritated some of them by
predicting that higher pay for teachers will require visible
improvements in the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people are not going to lift the compensation for
teachers if they feel they aren't getting more than they're getting
now,'' Gore told the 2.5-million-member group, which includes 1.8
million active teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Several teachers said after his speech that Gore seemed to be
signalling that _ like Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican
hopeful _ he had refused to rule out reliance on merit pay or
performance-based pay for teachers and other public school
employees. In the past, Gore has endorsed a limited experiment in
Denver with performance-based pay for teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Revelling in the warm reception from delegates who had endorsed
him 7,553 to 889 in a secret-ballot vote on the Fourth of July,
Gore inspired many rounds of applause as he itemized the main
features of his education agenda without mentioning its price tag
of $115 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Summing up his views, he said he favors bringing a populist
``revolution to our schools, treating teachers like the
professionals that they are, reducing class sizes, modernizing our
classrooms and connecting them to the Internet, (and) giving
teachers the training and the professional development
opportunities that are needed.''
</P>
<P>
   But after the euphoria wore off, some NEA members said they were
miffed by the way in which Gore qualified his support for raising
the pay of teachers to the level of other professionals in other
fields with the same education and hours of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like he wasn't admitting that we already aren't
being paid enough now,'' said Lianne R. Bennett, a 7th-grade
language arts teacher in Medford, N.J. ``But I don't suppose the
other gentleman (Bush) is any better on performance-based pay, so I
guess we're stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Sullivan, a Bush campaign spokesman, said later that, while
Bush hasn't explicitly endorsed linking the pay of individual
teachers to their performances, he advocates local control, ``which
would let localities choose to do that, if they decide that's best
in their locality.''
</P>
<P>
   Linking performance to pay is a touchy issue with teachers in
the NEA. The day before Gore spoke, the convention turned down a
suggestion by its reform faction that it allow local affiliates to
negotiate such agreements with their districts.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two hours before Gore spoke, the convention
overwhelmingly adopted a resolution that satisfied both reformers
and traditionalists.
</P>
<P>
   The two-sentence policy statement said: ``NEA shall not promote
or in any way advocate merit pay or pay for performance. If,
however, an affiliate should be forced to negotiate or accept a
merit pay or pay for performance plan, the NEA shall provide
assistance to that local to protect the rights and benefits of its
members and will work to insure that any such proposed plan will
not be adopted unless agreed to by that local.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Despite a reputation for antisocial behavior (the
episode of the amputated earlobe looms large), Vincent van Gogh was
a people person. He was an avid talker and letter writer, fluent in
four languages. Early in his short life he held a series of
face-the-public jobs, as an apprentice art dealer, a schoolteacher
and an evangelical preacher.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as an artist in Paris, he met practically everyone in the
avant-garde and had visions of establishing an artists' colony in
Provence; ``the school of the south,'' he called it. Only toward
the end, when mental illness closed in, did he become isolated, and
even then he bonded with his doctor, Paul Gachet, who, the artist
noted solicitously, was even more of a nervous wreck than he was.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gogh is surrounded by people, and very much part of the
crowd, in ``Van Gogh: Face to Face,'' a show devoted to his
portraits, at the Museum of Fine Arts here. Among the 80 entries
are paintings and drawings of friends and neighbors, lovers and
strangers, and repeatedly, magnetically, of the artist himself.
</P>
<P>
   No career is better known than his, and textbook icons abound
here, along with less familiar fare, including a series of
seldom-traveled early drawings from the Netherlands. There are also
notable omissions, of paintings too well known not to be missed,
which may be why the show feels somewhat patchy and unresolved. Put
the blame on supply and demand. With a spate of van Gogh
exhibitions poised to hit the boards soon, the international loan
situation must be tight.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever one's gripes, van Gogh is van Gogh; there is no one
like him. He fills whatever room he's in. At his best and worst _
both are represented here _ he is transfixing. In portraiture, a
genre that he was particularly attracted to, he is unsurpassed.
</P>
<P>
   He had complex views about what it meant, though. He disparaged
photographic accuracy. But he also kept himself a step removed from
unbridled psychological scrutiny. Predisposed to view the world
through a moralist's eye, he often treated the people he painted,
including himself, as types, actors in an emblematic drama called
life.
</P>
<P>
   For him that drama seems to have begun smoothly enough. The
child of a middle-class Dutch Reformed minister, he was an
appealing youth: a carrot-top with shapely lips, intense small eyes
and an alert, bookish temperament. At 16 he landed a position in an
art gallery in the Hague specializing in high-quality
reproductions. He did well there and was transferred to the
company's London branch.
</P>
<P>
   In London something went wrong. He fell in love, was rebuffed
and grew morose. He started reading the Bible and became obsessed
with John Bunyan's 17th-century inspirational allegory ``The
Pilgrim's Progress.'' This book, rooted in nonconformist
working-class theology, helped persuade him that his future lay in
missionary work among the poor.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to a down-and-out coal-mining village in Belgium, where
he taught the Gospel, nursed the sick and drew portraits of the
miners. After a run-in with the local church, he decided to channel
his energies into art, following the example of the French painter
Jean-Francois Millet (1814-75), who had made peasant life his
subject.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston exhibition _ organized by George T.M. Shackelford of
the Museum of Fine Arts, George S. Keyes of the Detroit Institute
of Arts and Joseph J. Rishel of the Philadelphia Museum of Art _
begins at this point, around 1881, when van Gogh, in his late 20s,
had returned to the Hague to begin his new career.
</P>
<P>
   He had been looking at all kinds of art for years, from Dutch
old master paintings to English popular engravings. He now set out
on a crash course in self-education as a draftsman by copying
pictures from student manuals and drawing the figure from life.
</P>
<P>
   With no money for professional models, he asked elderly
pensioners in the city to sit for him. His drawings of them fill
the first room of the show, and they're strange, at once bland and
overly expressive, closer to caricatures than to portraits. That
makes sense given that van Gogh's ambition at the time to find work
as a magazine illustrator specializing in social realism.
</P>
<P>
   The didactic impulse also marks his portraits of Sien Hoornick,
a seamstress and former prostitute with whom he lived. She never
looks the same twice. In one drawing she's a proletarian heroine in
a prim white cap; in another, Melancholy personifed in a Morticia
Addams dress. His sketches of her young daughter _ a feral,
tousled-haired imp _ are far more direct and alive.
</P>
<P>
   This phase culminated in the 1885 painting ``The Potato
Eaters,'' which is not in the show. Van Gogh feared that the
picture, with its lumpish, simian figures, would be taken as a
cartoon version of peasant life. And when it met with general
antipathy, he knew he had to change course.
</P>
<P>
   So he went to Paris, where a new kind of art was being made. He
stayed for two years, met many painters _ Gauguin,
Toulouse-Lautrec, Seurat, Pissarro _ and learned from all of them.
He also began the series of self-portraits that form the emotional
core of his output.
</P>
<P>
   The seven in the show are worth the price of admission: They're
like a dramatic monologue with quick-change roles and hairpin
shifts in tone and mood. In three pictures from 1887 he is
successively a shy peasant in a straw hat, an urban swell in a
nubby tweed suit, and a grave, apparitional being with
creme-de-menthe eyes who seems to be dissolving in clouds of
jewel-like pointillist paint. Finally self-exoticizing reaches an
audacious extreme in a slightly later painting in which van Gogh
presents himself as a tonsured Buddhist monk.
</P>
<P>
   This self-portrait dates from 1888, when, feeling badly strung
out, he left Paris for Arles in the south of France. There he
experienced his own private golden age. He was joined by Gauguin.
Van Gogh's art opened up. The richest concentration of portraits
date from this year.
</P>
<P>
   Among the best were those of a single family, the Roulins:
Joseph, a local postman; his wife, Augustine; and their three
children. He painted each several times, and 17 likenesses have
been brought together for a reunion here.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gogh loved these people, and he gave them starring roles in
his gallery of moral portraits. He compared Joseph, with his
luxuriant beard and tippler's cheeks, to Socrates and depicted him
as an exemplary upright man of the people, sitting face forward, at
attention, as if about to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Augustine is assigned the archetypal maternal role: she's a
placid, silent monument. Here again children escape typecasting:
Armand, 16, just looks like a moodily teen-agerish Cool; Camille,
10, is a scamp in a mushroom-shaped beret; the infant Marcelle, in
one of the artist's wittiest portraits, is a squalling, colicky
little monstrosity, truly fit to be tied.
</P>
<P>
   The stay at Arles ended in disaster: mental collapse,
self-mutilation, a ruptured friendship with Gauguin. Van Gogh was
whisked off to an asylum in nearby St. Remy, and turned out some
awesome paintings there. But the path was downhill, and that's how
the show feels. From this point on it's art as psychodrama.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Further breakdowns brought him to Gachet in Auvers, near Paris.
Van Gogh seemed to perk up a bit there; he painted ``Starry
Night.'' But the portraits _ apart from one of a sweet, sleepy-eyed
gardener and those of Gachet himself, represented only by a couple
of etchings in Boston _ are pathetic: maladroit depictions of
robotic adults and Munchkin-like children. The denouement came
soon. Alone in a field, van Gogh shot himself and died two days
later.
</P>
<P>
   His reputation not only survived him but also grew,
tremendously. The exhibition catalog demonstrates his influence on
figurative painters from Matisse to Chuck Close. The current vogue
for portraiture owes everything to the artist who gave the genre
its modern form.
</P>
<P>
   The very look of his paintings _ with their cable-knit textures,
Rajput colors and surreal versions of real things _ defines modern
art for many viewers. But van Gogh is modern as much for what he
was as for what he did. His art and his life are inseparable.
</P>
<P>
   He gave us our first complete visual record of an ego dying in
public; we watch it over and over, like a documentary video of a
disaster. He's our first celebrity martyr, the patron saint of our
cult of disability. He's that most contemporary of tragic heroes,
the blameless victim of the self. We line up for exhibitions of his
work to look at great art, which even flawed shows deliver, but
also to spend some quality time in his charismatically star-crossed
company.

BIG SISTER WINS IN WIMBLEDON MEGA-MATCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The big sister was still watching out for the little
sister.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter that they no longer were alongside the
dilapidated hard courts of a Compton, Calif., slum with
neighborhood toughs trying to shove them out of line for the ice
cream truck. It didn't matter that they were standing on the
elegant lawn of the All England Lawn Tennis &AMP; Croquet Club,
engulfed by 13,812 gawkers and the world watching on television.
</P>
<P>
   The maelstrom had changed but the instinct hadn't. Surrounded by
interlopers, they pulled together. Venus Williams, 20, reached
across the net to clasp the hand of Serena Williams, 18, embraced
her as if to form a protective cocoon, and whispered words only
they could appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's get out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the pained epitaph to an occasion trumpeted all over
the planet, the Wimbledon War of the Williamses. To onlookers, it
was an event; to the participants, it was an ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up, the big girl occasionally had picked on the little
girl because she wanted to protect her turf. This time she was
forced to.
</P>
<P>
   Venus's 6-2, 7-6 (7-3) semifinal victory over Serena Thursday
was utterly joyless. It earned Venus a shot at tennis's most
coveted title in Saturday's final against defending champion
Lindsay Davenport, who took care of Jelena Dokic, 6-4, 6-2, in the
near seclusion of the second semi while the press was busy poking
at and probing the sisters one more time.
</P>
<P>
   But there was little sense of accomplishment for Venus. Despite
their prematch claim that they're all smiles and no competition can
intrude upon their solidarity, the Williamses acted as if they'd
been ordered to clean their rooms and do the dishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really bitter,'' conceded Venus.
</P>
<P>
   But it was business. Family business, perhaps, so delicate that
the girls' father, coach, and mentor, Richard, claimed he couldn't
bring himself to come to the grounds and watch. But business
nonetheless, a necessary evil dictated by the random heartlessness
of the draw and the sisters' spectacular success. The precious spot
in the final came down to Williams vs. Williams. Like it or not.
They insisted they would like it; they acted as if they most
definitely did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone had to move on,'' said Venus. ``It was either going to
be me or Serena. In this instance, it was me.''
</P>
<P>
   And Serena took it hard. She was curt with the press, in
contrast to her spontaneous eloquence in previous postmatch
sessions. Asked to assess the impact, she said, ``I don't know. I
lost in the semifinals at Wimbledon.''
</P>
<P>
   And that was a shock to many, except those conspiracy theorists
who believe that Richard rigs the results of his daughters'
confrontations and that he had declared this was Venus's turn to
sparkle. Asked about such a sub rosa subplot, Venus said, ``Not
that I'm aware of.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than predestination, the outcome was attributable to
Serena's inexplicable collapse. The effervescent sensation of the
women's draw through five rounds and owner of the only Grand Slam
crown in the family _ the 1999 US Open _ she was considered the
overwhelming favorite against Venus, whom she had beaten in their
last meeting, the 1999 Grand Slam Cup final, after losing their
first three at the Australian and Italian Opens in 1998 and the
Lipton last year.
</P>
<P>
   But sometime during the one-day interim between their
quarterfinal wins and their semifinal showdown, Serena's ebullience
disappeared. She came onto the court a step ahead of Venus, but
that was the last time she would maintain the lead all day. Her
performance was listless, her body language downcast. And Venus
looked no more enthused. The sisters had come out for warmups five
minutes early, but it was immediately evident that they weren't
eager for the celebration to begin but anxious to get the nuisance
over with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult,'' said Venus, ``because the pressure
was always on.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure surrounding the first semifinal sister act in a
Grand Slam event since tennis let professionals onto the property
in 1968. The pressure of trying to become the first
African-American woman to win Wimbledon since Althea Gibson in
1958. And the subsidiary pressure of sewing up a place on the US
Olympic team, which will be announced Monday; Venus and Davenport
were guaranteed two of the three singles berths, but Serena failed
to leapfrog Monica Seles in the WTA rankings for the last one, and
her only hope now is that coach Billie Jean King picks her for
doubles.
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation that Venus might spurn an invitation
to Sydney for the Games in September if Serena isn't chosen. She
didn't address that issue, but she did explain her sense of sibling
obligation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always the big sister,'' she said. ``I always take care of
Serena, no matter what. I always make the decisions. I'm always a
role model for Serena.''
</P>
<P>
   Basically, she was a model of determination Thursday, overcoming
25 unforced errors, while Serena epitomized inconsistency,
committing 36. She and Venus engaged in the occasional
scintillating rally of which they're capable. But Serena couldn't
keep up with her elder. She displayed her self-disgust by dropping
her racket one time and bouncing it another. The problem was that
she couldn't bounce back.
</P>
<P>
   There were four breaks in the first set, and three went to
Venus. Serena seemed on the verge of asserting herself when she
broke Venus in the first game of the second set. But she squandered
two chances to virtually clinch the set by breaking to 4-1, instead
allowing Venus to close the gap to 3-2 after two deuces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't play well today,'' said Serena. ``I didn't feel
it. I'm very disappointed in the way I performed.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially in the crunch. After letting Venus off the hook, she
allowed her to get back on track by hitting a two-hand backhand
into the net, thus getting broken to 4-4. The sisters held serve to
6-6, and Serena surged to a 3-1 edge in the tiebreaker. But she
didn't manage another point, and when she double-faulted to give
Venus the match, the protagonists almost froze over the abrupt
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Serena lowered her head and seemed to be crying, although she
said emphatically, ``Tears weren't coming down my eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the two slowly walked to the net for the congratulatory
handshake and conciliatory embrace, and quickly left the court to
Davenport and Dokic.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't on it for long. Trading early breaks, including the
point that clinched the first set, Davenport needed only 50 minutes
to handle her unseeded 17-year-old opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The champion has about the most balanced perspective on the
tour, and she didn't begrudge the Williamses the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was pretty exceptional, two sisters playing in a
semifinal,'' said Davenport, the No. 2 seed. ``By no means should
myself playing Dokic overshadow that. I mean, that's pretty
special.''
</P>
<P>
   Unique, in fact. One wit in the stands expressed it early in the
match when he yelled, ``Go, Williams.''
</P>

ART REVIEW: A LIFETIME OF WELL-CHOSEN WORDS AND QUIRKY MATERIALS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla., Calif., Fla., Ill., Texas, England)   By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During the summer of 1956, after graduating from
high school, Ed Ruscha left his home in Oklahoma City, hopped into
his 1950 Ford and headed west on Route 66 for Los Angeles, where he
was going to become a commercial artist.
</P>
<P>
   His timing was good. An art scene was shaping up. Walter Hopps
and Ed Kienholz were about to open the Ferus Gallery. A group that
included John Altoon, Billy Al Bengston, Wallace Berman, Ed Moses,
Larry Bell, Craig Kauffman and Robert Irwin was soon to get
national attention. Within a few years, the new Los Angeles County
Museum of Art would open; the Pasadena Art Museum would be a place
to see new art, again thanks to Hopps, who went to work there; June
Wayne would start the Tamarind Lithography Workshop, which spawned
Gemini GEL, one of the country's best printmaking shops; and
Artforum magazine would get off the ground in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The art produced was eclectic, but the city came to be
associated with the kind of work that Ruscha exemplified. It was
cool, sly, deceptively mechanical-looking. It had a self-regarding,
matter-of-fact charisma. In his case especially, it was born of
laconic Western spaces, strip malls, highways and the Technicolor
movie. Increasingly it came to be about film, an art about art.
</P>
<P>
   If you can catch the traveling retrospective of Ruscha's 40-year
career, now here at the Hirshhorn Museum, you should do so.
Ruscha's scrutiny of the world is truly American, and his art
hovers tantalizingly on the edge of slapstick, with enough
intimation of melancholy to keep you guessing. Its rewards are not
exactly tactile or sensual, paint being used interchangeably with
eccentric materials like vanishing cream and blueberries as if they
were equally dubious propositions for art, but the results are more
than just cerebral.
</P>
<P>
   Ruscha navigates a pregnant space between Pop and Conceptual
art. You read the words he paints, his ironic titles, and see how
they mix with his images, and you're sure something is up, just not
always precisely what. A sleight-of-hand brand of humor is at work,
which derives both from a natural lightness of spirit and a refusal
to condescend or moralize. Jasper Johns and Andy Warhol are the
obvious names with which to reckon in his case, but Ruscha's
buoyancy separates him, creditably, and has kept him bobbing along
consistently through the decades.
</P>
<P>
   The familiar story is that he had one of those eureka moments
when he saw a reproduction of a Johns ``Target'' painting in a
magazine in 1957. It gave him the conviction that he didn't have to
splash paint around like the Abstract Expressionists to be a
serious artist. He went to art school to study commercial design
and got a job as a layout artist and graphic designer for a local
advertising agency, but he realized that he didn't want to do that
after all. He traveled in Europe, where he saw more works by Johns
and by Robert Rauschenberg in Paris, and on the way back he saw a
Roy Lichtenstein show in New York.
</P>
<P>
   His early pictures combined his diverse experiences differently.
His first mature paintings, nods to Johns, consisted of words:
``boss'' painted in big, greasy black capital letters on a muddy
brown backdrop, and ``ace,'' its letters made into even more of a
sculpture in relief. The self-aggrandizing irony of the titles
spoke for itself.
</P>
<P>
   Then came ``Large Trademark With Eight Spotlights,'' which
recreated the 20th Century Fox logo, with its roving spotlights, on
a big, horizontal canvas, as if on a wide screen. It was organized
in oblique-angle one-point perspective, the surface flat, opaque
and anonymous, unlike ``Boss'' or ``Ace.'' This would become
Ruscha's consistent mode: deadpan, sneakily enigmatic. In its smart
use of typefaces and lettering, it also exploited his commercial
training _ the towering T in ``The Mountain'' is an example. It was
attached to icons of Los Angeles and the West.
</P>
<P>
   So when he painted a Standard Oil gas station in the same format
as the 20th Century Fox logo, he was again glorifying a Western
symbol, this time of the highway, and now additionally implying the
experience of driving past it, one-point perspective creating a
cartoon effect of the station as if we were rushing past it in our
own 1950 Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Ruscha described what he wanted: ``The image of a train that we
have from movies is from lower right to upper left; it is a force
of exaggeration that we've seen many times. It parallels the
concept of speed, going from nowhere to somewhere, nowhere to
everywhere. If you can get that into a painting, then there is a
sense of accomplishment. There's a kind of conviction in the
awkwardness of doing that that appealed to me.''
</P>
<P>
   You could say that the appeal of awkwardness became one of his
themes. The plain books of photographs he put together in the early
60s depicting gas stations, ordinary apartment buildings, swimming
pools and parking lots _ tremendously influential on younger
artists _ were snapshots of nowhere places, often
indistinguishable.
</P>
<P>
   But like the painting of the Standard Oil station, they can seem
awkwardly beautiful even as they raise the question, What's the
point? The images are numbered (34 parking lots; 26 gasoline
stations; 9 swimming pools), as if a meaning might be involved, or
is there no meaning? Maybe the images are just another way for
Ruscha to number pages in a book. You can't be sure.
</P>
<P>
   A conceptual game, but time has a way of lending even the most
conceptual and nondescript of these images a degree of nostalgia.
Works in the show like ``Noise, Pencil, Broken Pencil, Cheap
Western,'' with its reproduction of an old dime comic book, have a
retrospective charm that was presumably the reverse of their
original intent. Except that in his ambiguity, Ruscha leaves enough
room for us to shift our chairs around and get an occasional view
from the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   Nostalgia isn't bad, it turns out. With their simulation of
scratchy black-and-white films, Ruscha's recent paintings bask in
it.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on top of that, there is an unexpected lyricism to the
best work. It derives partly from the sheer fluency of the
surfaces, the words and images as smooth as polished stones in a
clear stream, with the concomitant result that meaning flows over
them without sticking.
</P>
<P>
   A few of his word-pictures end up as not much more than coy
one-liners: ``ice'' in red-hot letters, ``space'' in comic-book
sci-fi typeface against an almost empty blue field, and a squiggly
``jelly.'' But sometimes his words floating in vast colored fields
or against Hollywood backdrops can take on a surprising aspect akin
to actors isolated on a stage. They can look remarkably vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   This is another source of the art's lyrical effect. Ruscha, like
Johns, is famous for untethering words from their moorings,
exploiting linguistic instability to imply an instability in our
grasp of experience generally. A different way of putting this is
to say that his words and images get to make themselves over in his
pictures. They are largely freed from the past and sent out into
the world with a fresh identity and maybe a chance at a few minutes
in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   It's a classic American dream. It also happens to be Ruscha's
story.
</P>
<P>
   The show travels to the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago
(Nov. 20 to Feb. 5, 2001), the Miami Art Museum (March 22, 2001, to
June 3, 2001), the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, Texas, (July 1,
2001, to Sept. 30, 2001) and the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford,
England (Oct. 28, 2001, to Jan. 13, 2002).

INSIDE ART: $30.4 MILLION FOR SOUTH AFRICAN COLLECTION; 1 MILLIONTH
VISITOR FOR TATE MODERN; AND $10 MILLION DONATION FOR ISRAEL
MUSEUM 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A rare group of old master paintings, French furniture,
silver and sculptures that once belonged to Julius Wernher, a
diamond merchant who was a governor of the South African
conglomerate De Beers, sold at Christie's here on Wednesday night
for $30.4 million, twice its $15 million estimate.
</P>
<P>
   In a packed salesroom, dealers and collectors bid relentlessly
for the best of the art and objects housed for nearly a century at
the Wernher family's two homes: Bath House, Piccadilly, and Luton
Hoo, a stately home in Bedfordshire.
</P>
<P>
   A small group of old master paintings and several extraordinary
pieces of silver were the stars of the evening. While the buyers
were mainly dealers, Christie's executives said after the sale that
many were bidding on behalf of museums.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Blumka, a New York dealer, bought a rare piece of
silver, a late Gothic figure of St. Sebastian dated 1497 and
estimated at $1 million, for $2.9 million. Officials at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art confirmed Thursday that Blumka was
bidding for the Cloisters, which is part of the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diana and Her Nymphs Hunting'' (c. 1636), an oil sketch by
Rubens from one of the famous series made for Philip IV of Spain to
display at the Torre de la Parada, his lodge near Madrid, sold for
$4.6 million, nearly three times its high estimate of $1.6 million.
Experts said the sketch was considered one of the best examples of
Rubens' Baroque period. It was bought by the Savings Bank of Madrid
for the Prado, Christie's confirmed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Hazlitt, Gooden &AMP; Fox, the London dealers, bought Titian's
``Portrait of Giacomo Doria'' (c. 1531) for $3.6 million, nearly
twice its $1.9 million estimate. Christie's confirmed that the
dealers bought it for the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   Another top price was paid for ``Saturn Devouring His
Children,'' a bronze cast from a 17th-century model by Pietro
Francavilla. Estimated at $940,000 to $1.4 million, it was sold for
$1.6 million to Cyril Humphries. Humphries was sitting next to
Robert H. Smith, the celebrated bronze collector who is chairman of
the National Gallery of Art in Washington, and people at the sale
speculated that Humphries was buying the bronze for Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds from Wednesday's sale will go to the Wernher heirs and
to maintaining Luton Hoo.
</P>
<P>
   THE TATE'S CROWDS
</P>
<P>
   Last week, only a month and a half after opening, the new $214
million Tate Modern welcomed its millionth visitor. By now, more
than 1,063,161 people have gone to see the giant renovated power
station in the regenerated Southwark section of London, the first
new national museum in Britain in 100 years and its first devoted
solely to modern art.
</P>
<P>
   Before the opening, officials at the Tate estimated attendance
for its first year at about two million. Now, they say, they are
now hoping for twice that figure.
</P>
<P>
   The crowds are bigger than the first Tate Gallery, now called
Tate Britain, across the Thames in Milbank, has ever seen. That
museum broke a record in 1996 during its Cezanne retrospective,
when it averaged about 14,000 visitors a day. The Tate Modern is
getting about 15,000 people a day, down from 24,000 in May.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance is also far greater at the new museum than at the
Guggenheim Bilbao, the three-year-old museum in the Basque region
of Spain designed by the Los Angeles architect Frank O. Gehry. In
its first year, the Guggenheim Bilbao had about 1.4 million
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to go to London to see art from the Tate. The
institution has just begun its first online art program. ``It's a
way of extending the frame of the gallery,'' said Nicolas Serota,
director of all the Tate museums. ``It makes art accessible to
millions.''
</P>
<P>
   The first commissioned work in the program, ``Uncomfortable
Proximity,'' a Web art project by Harwood De Mongrel, a team of
British computer artists, can be seen on the Tate's Web site,
www.tate.org.uk. It looks similar to the Tate's Web site in layout
and design but has new images and texts. It is parallel to the
Tate's main Web site, emphasizing the difference between them.
</P>
<P>
   A second commissioned artwork, ``Le Match des Couleurs,'' by the
British sculptor and installation artist Simon Patterson, will go
online on Wednesday. It features a recording of Radio France 1's
football commentator, Eugene Sacomano, reading the football results
for all the teams that have ever played in the French Football
League. He gives each team a color based on the hexadecimal
equivalent color system, a system of specifying colors on the
Internet. Both works will be online until June 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not unlike the video artists of the 1960s, there are some
practitioners working only in this field,'' Serota said. ``And
there are others like Simon Patterson, who migrate and explore art
online.''
</P>
<P>
   GIFT TO ISRAEL MUSEUM
</P>
<P>
   The Israel Museum in Jerusalem has been refurbishing and
renovating its galleries one by one with donations. The latest gift
_ $10 million from Andrea and Charles Bronfman, of the family that
is selling the Seagram Co. to Vivendi SA, a French conglomerate _
will be used to renovate and reinstall the wing housing the
archaeology collection, including some of the world's best biblical
Jewish, early Christian and Islamic antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   The wing was built in 1965, when the museum opened, with money
from Edgar and Charles Bronfman and their sisters, Baroness Minda
de Gunzburg and Phyllis Lambert, to honor the 70th birthday of
their father, Samuel Bronfman.
</P>
<P>
   Since the space has not been touched in 35 years, it can no
longer accommodate a growing collection of material from newly
excavated sites throughout Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, Charles Bronfman has been a visible player in
Israel, both in the business and cultural community,'' said James
Snyder, the museum director. ``He recognized that archaeology is
the true and most important cultural patrimony of Israel.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Protesters who clashed with police during meetings
of international agencies in Seattle and Washington plan mass
marches and candlelight vigils during the Republican and Democratic
national conventions, organizers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Group leaders said they expect about 30,000 protesters to flood
the streets of Philadelphia and Los Angeles to draw attention to
what they see as the corporate takeover of U.S. politics and
economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   Among the chanting crowds will be some of the same
building-climbing, turtle-costumed groups that disrupted last
fall's World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle and that
skirmished with police officers at the April gathering of the World
Bank and International Monetary Fund in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   However, unlike the demonstrations in Seattle and Washington,
the protests will not focus on globalization, which refers to the
trade and investment ties among countries that opponents say have
led to increased job competition with low-wage countries.
</P>
<P>
   That issue will be addressed, but demonstrators will focus
instead on domestic issues such as campaign finance reform, poverty
and police power, the organizers said at a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both political parties are bought and paid for by a small
number of corporations,'' said Margaret Prescod, an activist for
the R2D2 Coalition, a national network of organizations
coordinating the protests.
</P>
<P>
   Until politicians are accountable to ``working people,'' she
said, the political system will remain under the control of
corporations that donate millions of dollars to politicians and
political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you're looking at the global economy or the U.S.
Congress, they're both being controlled by the same people,''
Prescod said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Convention begins July 31 and ends Aug.
3. The Democratic gathering runs from Aug. 14 through 17.
</P>
<P>
   Protest organizers insisted that their demonstrations would be
peaceful. But Cheri Honkala, an R2D2 activist working on the
Philadelphia demonstrations, warned, ``If we are prevented from
exercising our constitutional right to protest, we will use massive
civil disobedience.''
</P>
<P>
   One protest group, the Berkeley-based Ruckus Society, has opened
demonstrator boot camps near Malibu, Calif., and in central
Philadelphia. Recruits are learning how to form human blockades and
to drape banners from high-rise buildings. They will use colorful
costumes to convey their message.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the protesters' pledge to remain peaceful, Philadelphia
and Los Angeles police are preparing for Seattle-type protests.
With help from the Secret Service and FBI, both cities have set up
broad ``no-protest'' zones around the convention sites.
</P>
<P>
   The off-limits areas stretch for blocks. They will include a
single location _ beyond shouting distance of each convention hall
_ where demonstrators will be permitted to assemble in shifts under
heavy guard.
</P>
<P>
   Similar protest ``pits'' were used at the 1992 and 1996
conventions, and demonstrators reluctantly respected their
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, protest organizers say they will not give up the
streets. ``The pits are like prisons, and we don't intend to go
there,'' Prescod said.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, police intend to confine demonstrators to a
section of Franklin D. Roosevelt Park, across a boulevard and large
parking lot from the First Union Center, where Texas Gov. George W.
Bush's likely nomination is scheduled. Philadelphia has adopted an
ordinance that bars protesters from wearing masks while engaging in
``harassing'' behavior. Many protesters in Seattle who clashed with
police wore ski masks and hoods.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles pit is a parking lot a block away from the
downtown Staples Center, where the Democrats are expected to
nominate Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to ensure the city can function,'' said Los Angeles
police Cmdr. David Kalish. ``We have to be cognizant of what we
have learned from other cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Roland Lee, Philadelphia Police Department spokesman, said:
``We're going to protect people.''
</P>
<P>
   Protesters in Philadelphia will kick off their demonstrations on
Sunday, July 30, calling for universal health care. The next day,
when the Republican convention officially starts, a march against
poverty will be held under the banner of ``Economic Human Rights.''
Other demonstrations with separate themes, still to be decided on,
will be held throughout the rest of the week.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles protests will begin on Sunday, Aug. 13, with a
march in support of death row inmate Mumia Abu Jamal, a
Philadelphia activist and journalist who was convicted of killing a
policeman. His supporters say he was framed.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, as the convention opens, the theme will be ``Human
needs, not corporate greed,'' and demonstrators will focus on
poverty. On Tuesday, the issues are to be racism and gay rights
under the banner, ``An injury to one is an injury to all.'' Police
brutality and the growth of prisons will be the subject of
Wednesday protests. On Thursday, as the convention ends, activists
are scheduled to focus on immigration and issues of global justice.
A candlelight vigil is scheduled to coincide with the Gore's
acceptance speech that night.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: A bash _ and a bashing
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush was quietly celebrating his 54th birthday today
with his family in Austin. But as he returned from a noontime jog,
staffers jumped out from behind bushes and a gazebo yelling,
``Surprise.'' About 300 workers from Bush's office and presidential
campaign threw him a party on the lawn, singing ``Happy Birthday''
and serving chocolate and white cakes decorated with ``Happy
Birthday Governor.'' In Washington, he got less-friendly greetings
from the Democratic National Committee, which poked fun at his
relationship with oil companies with a cake decorated with oil
pumps.
</P>
<P>
   AND THIS WEEK, IT'S TIGHTER AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   Just a week after polls showed George W. Bush with double-digit
leads over Al Gore, the latest Fox News/Opinion Dynamics survey
shows a close race between the two. Forty-two percent of
respondents said they prefer Bush, while 37 percent like Gore.
Green Party candidate Ralph Nader pulled 7 percent and the Reform
Party's Pat Buchanan got 2 percent. That means there's 12 percent
out there still looking for a place to go.
</P>
<P>
   ONE FROM COLUMN A, ONE FROM _
</P>
<P>
   Three members of Congress _ one Hispanic, one female and one
black _ have been named to leadership roles for the Republican
convention in the hope of presenting an image of diversity. Reps.
Henry Bonilla of Texas, Jennifer Dunn of Washington and J.C. Watts
of Oklahoma will be deputy permanent chairmen of the convention
that begins July 31 in Philadelphia, and probably will have
speaking roles. Campaign officials for George W. Bush say the
convention will reflect the diversity Bush wants in the Republican
Party.
</P>
<P>
   VETTING FROM EVERYWHERE
</P>
<P>
   Being named a potential running mate can get nasty. Special
interest networks are beginning their own vetting process. And, if
the politician has voted ``wrong''or taken offending stands, the
offended groups begin a concerted discrediting drive. Sen. Evan
Bayh of Indiana is getting an early thumbs down from abortion
rights activists, who don't want him on the Democratic ticket. Bayh
considers himself strong on choice and women's rights, but once
made one vote against so-called partial birth abortions. On the
other side of the aisle, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge's veep
campaign also is in trouble over the abortion issue, with Christian
conservatives threatening a defection to Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   SHORING UP MEDICARE
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore went to a suburban Chicago senior citizens center today
to cap a weeklong focus on health care by contrasting his Medicare
proposal with a Bush plan that he dismissed as ``a piggy bank for
big tax cuts.'' Gore said he'll spend $339 billion over 10 years to
shore up Medicare, and said George W. Bush's plan offers ``not one
dime.'' Flipping through charts, Gore said the Bush Medicare plan
raises questions about the future of health care for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   SPEEDING UP IMMIGRATION
</P>
<P>
   In his third recent address to a major Hispanic organization,
George W. Bush on Wednesday portrayed the Immigration and
Naturalization Service as inefficient and vowed to change its
culture to improve services for new immigrants. Bush pledged $500
million in new spending to cut the average time needed to process
an immigration application to six months. Addressing the annual
convention of the National Council of La Raza in San Diego, Bush
said the process now takes between three and five years; the INS
claims the average time is 12 months. Al Gore addressed La Raza on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   GOP WOMEN STRONG IN VEEP POLL
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole and Christie Whitman rank with the strongest
potential candidates to be George W. Bush's running mate, a new
survey shows. Two men were judged the strongest GOP candidates for
vice president in the national poll by Intersurvey. But both of
them _ retired Gen. Colin Powell and Sen. John McCain _ have said
they don't want the job. The order of preference after Dole, the
former Red Cross president and presidential candidate, and Whitman,
the New Jersey governor, were Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge,
Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson and Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating.
</P>
<P>
   BEWARE, THE TAX MEN ARE WATCHING
</P>
<P>
   The IRS issued an election-year warning that churches, charities
and many other tax-exempt organizations should not engage in
political fund-raising or activities encouraging support for or
opposition to any candidates. The organizations involved are exempt
from federal income taxes under section 501(c)(3) of the tax code.
Contributions made to organizations that lose their 501(c)(3)
status are not deductible by the donors on their income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   BUTT OUT, SAY DEMOCRATS
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco money is not welcome by the host committee that is
raising money for the Democratic convention in Los Angeles next
month. Committee head Noelia Rodriguez signed an agreement not to
accept or solicit donations from any tobacco company or its
subsidiaries. This comes as the committee is still $3 million to $4
million short of its fund-raising target of $35 million. ``We look
forward to showcasing Los Angeles as the largest smoke-free city in
the nation,'' Rodriguez said. Philip Morris, one of the nation's
largest tobacco companies, has given $250,000 to the Philadelphia
host committee for the Republican convention, which begins July 31.
</P>
<P>
   GOING DOWN SWINGING
</P>
<P>
   Jack E. Robinson III, the beleaguered Republican challenger to
Sen. Ted Kennedy, appealed a decision by the Massachusetts ballot
law commission that he fell short of the needed 10,000 qualifying
signatures because some of those he submitted had been forged and
some were printed upside down. Taking his case to the state's
highest court, he challenged the ruling that 129 signatures were
invalid. If the court upholds his removal from the ballot,
Massachusetts will lack a Republican candidate for a Senate seat
for what is believed the first time in the state's history.
</P>
<P>
   POLS CAN ALWAYS DO THE SIDESTEP
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, who once regaled audiences with his wooden version of
the Macarena, knows he's not a skilled dancer. But he told an
interviewer in Philadelphia that he'd like to get better at it.
Gore often used the Macarena, which became a trademark of the 1996
Democratic National Convention in Chicago, to poke fun at his
reputation for having a stiff personality. He often asked audiences
for silence so he could do the ``Al Gore version of the Macarena.''
Then he would stand rigid for several seconds before asking, ``Want
to see me do it again?'' When the interviewer reminded him that his
wife, Tipper, thinks he's a good dancer, he chuckled.
</P>
<P>
   SENATE OK, BUT IF GORE COMES CALLING _
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.) plans to seek a third term,
saying he'll make education reform his top priority in the next six
years. In recent months, Lieberman has been mentioned as a possible
running mate for Al Gore, but said he doesn't expect to be asked.
However: ``Obviously, if that ever happened, I'd certainly think
about it, but to me, it's a nonevent.'' Lieberman, 58, upset
incumbent Lowell Weicker 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING LOCAL TV BACK INTO THE GAME
</P>
<P>
   As televised political coverage migrates away from broadcast
television to cable news networks, a new project is setting out to
convince local TV stations around the country that political
coverage can also be good television. With a $1.3 million grant
from the Pew Charitable Trusts, the Norman Lear Center at the
University of Southern California's Annenberg School for
Communication is creating Reliable Resources, a two-year program to
develop tools to help local TV stations beef up their political
coverage. The project hopes to persuade stations to increase the
quantity of their political stories, while focusing more on issues
and how they affect voters and less on the ``horse race.''

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Kosovo's capital today is a chaotic,
noisy town, its streets heaving with small traders, construction
work, sidewalk cafes and traffic jams. But the hubbub scarcely
speaks of a solution to Kosovo's many problems: a year after the
end of the war here, chaos and dislocation continue, manifested in
the doubling or even tripling of the population of this ramshackle
town, now home to more than half a million people.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly people from the villages, they are refugees who have
abandoned their burned-out homes and have sought work and shelter
in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   As more than 700,000 Kosovo Albanians flocked home from refugee
camps in six weeks last summer, or came down from their hiding
places in the hills, many seized Serb-owned houses here, forcing
Serbs and the Gypsies to flee.
</P>
<P>
   The war in the Kosovo province of Yugoslavia forced about
two-thirds of the province's 2 million people from their homes.
Hundreds of thousands remain displaced, living in tents and shacks
in villages, in drab and despondent refugee centers in towns, or
doubled up with relatives in cramped and unhealthy surroundings in
the cities, as many as 30 to an apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The refugee camps in neighboring Macedonia and Albania, which
took in more than 1 million Kosovo refugees in the three months of
NATO's war with Yugoslavia last year, are long empty, like
abandoned parking lots with a few discarded clothes lying among the
weeds. Only a few thousand mostly old or sick refugees remain in
the two countries, left behind in the struggle for survival.
</P>
<P>
   People are still returning to Kosovo every day. In front of the
Pristina airport are two large white tents where officials register
the hundreds of refugees arriving on daily flights from Western
Europe or further afield. As many as 140,000 people will return to
Kosovo this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Their host countries have deemed the province peaceful and safe,
but U.N. officials fear that the influx will strain Kosovo's
limited housing beyond the breaking point, adding to the ethnic and
other tensions that continue to explode in almost daily violence.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Arsim Krasniqi, 22, was among the refugees returning from
Germany recently. He was traveling alone, and no one met him. ``I
am happy to be coming back to a free Kosovo, but I am sad because I
have no family here,'' he said. ``My father and brother were
killed. My other brother is missing. At home everything is
burned.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother and sisters were arriving on another refugee flight
from Germany in several days' time, he said. ``Where we'll live, I
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On their first night back in Kosovo, thousands of returning
refugees end up on mattresses on the floor of a transit center in
Pristina. Adem Sylejmani, who runs the center for World Vision,
said many were still traumatized and uncertain.``One of the first
things they ask is, `Are there any Serbs around here?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most move on quickly, usually to relatives, or take a tent and
head home to their villages. ``We are left with the very vulnerable
people, the old, social cases, ones with family problems and mental
cases,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the enormous building activity in every corner of
Kosovo, U.N. officials are growing concerned that the province
simply does not have enough housing. ``Capacity is limited,'' said
Gottfried Koefner, assistant chief of the Kosovo mission of the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. ``People are squeezing, and we
are already seeing secondary displacement. People are ending up in
tents.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who return force other families out on the streets
as they reclaim their houses. At least 6,000 people are in
collective centers in public buildings in Kosovo, most of them
villagers who have nowhere else to go because their houses have
been burned and their relatives are unable to help.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Kouchner, the head of the U.N. administration in Kosovo,
has appealed for countries to slow the return of refugees,
particularly because aid officials are not planning to rebuild all
the destroyed homes here.
</P>
<P>
   More than 120,000 houses across the province were damaged or
destroyed in the war, about 80,000 of them so badly that they have
to be completely rebuilt, European officials found. International
assistance has helped repair 17,000 of the partly damaged homes.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 80,000 destroyed houses, 12,000 to 15,000 will be rebuilt
this year and a similar number next year, said Stephen Lewarne, the
head of reconstruction at the U.N. administration here. He is
seeking $126 million from international donors for housing for this
year alone.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The overall budget for reconstruction and recovery in Kosovo for
2000 is $1.3 billion, an amount that is just trickling in. The
3,500 houses that the European Union, the chief donor for
reconstruction, pledged to build last year are only now being
completed. Contracts for the 8,000 houses the union plans to build
this year were only signed at the end of May, and the immense task
of getting the construction materials into a province with poor
roads, no seaport and only a small airport still lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   By 2002, Lewarne said, the aid is likely to run out, and Kosovo
will be left to the dynamics of the private housing market. ``We
are not going to repair or rebuild everyone's home _ we do not have
the internal budget,'' he said. ``Even if we were able to, it would
not be a good idea, it would not be good governance.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Kosovo families have the means to build their own houses,
yet it is clear that thousands will never get their houses rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the very poorest Kosovars are those in refugee centers,
or the few who never made it back from camps in Albania or
Macedonia. Macedonia hopes the 900 Kosovar Albanians still in its
care will get home this year. Hamdi and Echme Bardigi, an elderly
couple, remain in a camp in Macedonia because their home in Kosovo
was burned, and they gave what little money they had to their son
so he could rebuild part of it. His son and his wife have eight
children, so it is too crowded to join them.
</P>
<P>
   In Radusa village, where thousands camped in tents last year,
just a few families now live in refugee housing. They are apathetic
and depressed.
</P>
<P>
   Izet Rama, 42, a farmer, who lives in one set of rooms with his
wife and six children, said: ``We do feel left behind. We don't
feel good at all. There is nothing to compare to your own
country.'' But he is cautious about going home, for his house is
burned, and he clearly does not want to give up what he has.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, in a suburb of Pristina called Germia, stands a
typical refugee center, immediately recognizable by the lines of
washing hanging in the garden. A former school, it is now home to
38 families, and smells strongly of unwashed, crowded humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Isa Plakiqi, 62, and his two sons live there. Leaning against
the door of his room, dressed in a characteristic Albanian white
felt hat that is dirty and yellow with age, Plakiqi told how he
lost his wife and daughter in an artillery attack by Serbian forces
last year. At the end of the war, he returned from their refuge
high in the mountains with his sons, one of whom is an invalid, and
found that his house in Drenica, in central Kosovo, had been
leveled with a bulldozer. ``We didn't have a tent, just a sheet of
plastic, and some people came and photographed us, and then they
brought us here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety houses in the village were destroyed,'' Plakiqi said.
``They promised to rebuild them. They said I would be the first in
line, but I don't trust them anymore.'' He said he had no money to
rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they gave me the building materials, I would build the
house myself,'' he said. ``I would be slow, because I am an
invalid, but I just would like to have my own house again. I am old
and just want to die there.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone wants to return to the villages. Shefkia and
Omer Zogjani are torn between city and village. With their three
children, they moved into a Serb-owned house in Pristina last
summer, after they found their house and village destroyed.
Grabovac, or Grabofc as it is called in Albanian, is a small mining
village tucked into the hillside just 10 miles from Pristina. All
but one of its 47 houses are burnt.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not even leave the outhouses standing,'' Zogjani
said.
</P>
<P>
   When he occupied a Serb-owned house in the city last year, he
thought that he had solved his problems. Now he is not sure that he
will be able to keep it. He earns a small wage at the mine in
Grabovac and said he could not afford to rebuild his village house.
And while he is in the city, he is unlikely to get any aid.
</P>
<P>
   In the village, his relatives face even more uncertainty. From
outside his tent on the hillside, Dalip Zogjani, 51, a cousin of
Omer, stared down at the village below him, his hands on his hips,
his eyes crinkled against the harsh sun. A year after he returned
from Macedonia, the houses remain charred ruins, their blackened
roof timbers poking into the sky, weeds growing in the living
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grass was up to your waist,'' he said. ``No one had lived
here for two years since the Serb police occupied it.'' Nearby, his
cousin, Banush Zogjani, cleared a small garden in front of a house
whose roof was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Only seven of the 47 families who lived here have returned,
living in tents and clearing away the rubble of broken tiles and
glass. They are busy digging their gardens and growing vegetables
for the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Only two families received aid last year and have plastic
sheeting stretched over new wooden beams for a makeshift roof.
Their bathrooms and kitchens are open to the sky. There is no
school and no shop, and life was tough in winter, when Dalip
Zogjani lived here with his 12-year-old son, brushing snow from the
tent each morning.
</P>

   He came back to Kosovo last July, and lodged his wife and
children with a friend in a neighboring town. But his elderly
mother insisted on returning home to the tent in the garden. ``She
was 86, she was sick, but she did not want to live in the city,''
he said. ``I carried her on my back to the refugee camps, and then
I carried her back home. She died here in our tent last October.''

TRAGIC ERROR

<P>
   In 1978, an Air India 747 climbed smoothly out of Bombay into a
calm but hazy night sky and began the customary right turn.
Suddenly it rolled left until its wings were past vertical,
steadied momentarily, then rolled left again and plunged 213 people
into the Arabian Sea. Investigators said the central cause of the
crash was pilot error. The captain, a 22-year veteran, apparently
became disoriented in the starless darkness and felt he was still
banking right when the plane was already pitched far to the left.
Making two turns to the left, he flew the giant plane, nearly
upside down, into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   This is possible, according to aviation writer William
Langewiesche, because airplanes often bank in a way that
neutralizes gravitational forces, so there is no seat-of-the-pants
sensation. The Air India passengers may never have known there was
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The story is retold now because of the National Transportation
Safety Board's conclusion Thursday that the ``spatial
disorientation'' of John F. Kennedy Jr. was a probable cause of the
fatal flight last July 16 in which he, his wife, and her sister
died.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was criticized posthumously by some for attempting the
flight from New Jersey to Martha's Vineyard in the evening despite
only 310 hours of flying experience and no instrument rating.
</P>
<P>
   Wisdom comes easily at a distance. Kennedy doubtless should have
accepted the offer of a flight instructor to accompany him on July
16. And the risk increased when the trip, planned for daylight
hours, was delayed into the evening. Kennedy was responsible for
three lives, not just his own. Still, the weather was favorable,
and Kennedy had flown into the Vineyard dozens of times, including
at least five times at night with no instructor aboard, according
to the NTSB. There is every reason to think the flight would have
been uneventful had not haze obliterated the visual horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Experience might have made a difference, but disorientation has
caused numerous accidents, the Air India crash being especially
well documented.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB has determined that Kennedy's ``failure to maintain
control of the airplane'' was the probable cause of the crash. But
it is a story of three vibrant lives cut short in an accident that
deserves more sorrow than blame.

WEB'S ACADEMIC PROMISE REMAINS UNFULFILLED _ FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif., Wash., Mich., Md., Neb.)   By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEAVERVILLE, Calif. _ When it learned last year that a private
company was offering college-level Advanced Placement courses on
the Web, the lone high school in this remote gold-rush town thought
it had finally discovered a perfect way to mine the genuine
academic potential of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   To the school, Trinity High, with 500 students, the prospect of
hiring its own Advanced Placement teacher had always been an
unaffordable luxury, even though taking such courses has become a
near necessity for students to get into the most competitive
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   So the school in the redwood-dense mountains, halfway between
San Francisco and the Oregon border, logged on. In essence, it took
the Clinton administration up on its pledge that educational
salvation could be found in new technology, and that the Web could
help the nation's poorest schools approximate the offerings of the
wealthiest, particularly in a corner of the curriculum where the
discrepancies were most stark.
</P>
<P>
   But so far the results here and elsewhere have been ragged,
suggesting that a computer can be a crude substitute for a teacher,
particularly when the students are so young, the stakes for them
are so high and the technology is so new.
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand students nationwide took college-level courses
online this year, through a private company called Apex Learning,
or one of three state university systems. They included two
teen-agers here, each of whom enrolled in an advanced government
and politics class in which the lessons were transmitted through
electronic text and animated short films, with exams graded via
email. The teacher was never seen.
</P>
<P>
   One Weaverville student dropped out midway through the spring
semester because, he said, he could not summon the stamina to
continue, absent a teacher standing in front of him; the other
student finished the same course, but two weeks late, frustrated by
countless technical glitches that often prevented him from logging
onto the Web for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Similar growing pains were felt by other districts, including
some of those that also contracted with Apex, of Bellevue, Wash., a
leader in providing Advanced Placement courses online. Of the 600
students in 28 states who enrolled in at least one of the company's
online Advanced Placement courses, two-thirds did not complete
enough of the course work to take the final exam.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is still pretty new and we are all learning about it,''
said Sally Narodick, the chief executive of Apex, which was
incorporated two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Much is riding on whether such efforts succeed.
</P>
<P>
   While President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore have heralded
the educational possibilities of the Web, most of what has been
labeled instruction in cyberspace is supplemental at best _ SAT
training, college counseling and virtual field trips.
</P>
<P>
   But online Advanced Placement courses represent something else,
one of the nation's first real opportunities to marshal technology
to plug gaping holes in the core curriculums of financially pressed
rural and inner-city high schools that cannot afford luxuries like
college level courses. Apex charges schools $325 to $400 per
student. Hiring a teacher could cost more than $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Apex, one of the few for-profit ventures in the online Advanced
Placement business, has raised $40 million from investors,
including Warburg Pincus, a Wall Street firm; Vulcan Ventures, a
fund led by Paul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft; and Edison
Schools, the public-school management company led by the
entrepreneur Christopher C. Whittle. Michigan State University, the
University of Nebraska and Johns Hopkins University are also
offering college-level courses to high school students online.
</P>
<P>
   All are seeking to close one of the widest gaps between rich and
poor schools. First begun as an experiment in the 1950s involving
fewer than 2,000 students and a handful of college level courses,
the Advanced Placement program, run by the College Board, now
involves more than 700,000 high school students who took 1.1
million examinations for college credit in dozens of subjects this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Though enrollment in at least one such course is regarded as an
unofficial prerequisite for admission to the nation's most
selective colleges _ and the University of California system gives
applicants who take such courses extra credit on their transcripts
_ only half of the nation's high school students have access to
Advanced Placement courses, which are regarded as a perk in
districts strapped for cash or short on honors students.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Education Richard Riley has proposed that every
high school in the country offer at least one Advanced Placement
course by 2002, and add at least one new course each year over the
next 10 years. The Clinton administration has asked Congress to
spend $10 million to help rural and inner-city schools purchase
Advanced Placement courses online.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis of California has asked the state Legislature to
spend an additional $20 million this year on his state alone, much
of it for online courses, as well as for teacher hiring.
</P>
<P>
   To Gaston Caperton, the president of the College Board, such
online courses are a weak stand-in for what he says the country
needs: 180,000 teachers trained to offer college-level courses to 2
million more high school students.
</P>
<P>
   But Francisco J. Hernandez, vice chancellor of the University of
California at Santa Cruz, says such plans are pipe dreams,
considering that many of the districts lacking Advanced Placement
courses are in the grip of a severe teacher shortage in even basic
subjects. Often, Hernandez said, an online course, however flawed,
is the only opportunity a student has to take one. This past school
year, the University of California College Prep Initiative,
conceived by Hernandez and operated out of the system's Santa Cruz
campus, used state grants to pay for 800 California high school
students to take Advanced Placement courses online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intent is not to be an alternative to a high quality
teacher and classroom,'' Hernandez said. ``Our intent is to be an
alternative to nothing, and that's what they're getting right
now.''

</P>
<P>
   In Weaverville, a town of 3,370 residents, many of them loggers
and forest rangers, the experience of the two students who took
Apex's online government course underscored the program's promise
and its flaws.
</P>
<P>
   For Brian Jones, 19, a senior who wants to be a record producer,
and Jeremy Forbes, 17, who dreams of becoming a cartoonist, taking
college-level ``U.S. Government and Politics'' introduced them to
the concepts of pluralism, federalism, liberalism and conservatism.
Both said they now looked at presidential politics in a new light.
</P>
<P>
   But each was tripped up by shortcomings that, so far, are
embedded in such courses.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-March, in the seventh week of the 15-week course, Jones
was still doing work he should have completed in the second week.
Overwhelmed by the idea of writing a two-page essay twice a week,
and an exam every three weeks, Jones was already thinking of
summer. And with his professor, Steve Sandweiss, 448 miles away in
Tacoma, Wash., where he is a professor at a local community
college, Jones could muster little energy to continue. And so he
dropped out, enrolling instead in his high school's civics course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel like doing any work,'' he said. ``I'm just not
organized a lot of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes was far more dogged, but he had ongoing problems signing
onto the Apex Web site _ sometimes because of problems on Apex's
end, and sometimes because of the limited capacity of the computers
in his school.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes finished the course two weeks late, but he did finish,
and took the Advanced Placement exam. He will know his grade this
week _ a 4 or 5, on a scale of 1 to 5, is likely to earn him a
college credit _ but said that for all the disruption he felt
well-prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Apex officials said that they were already working to rectify
problems, smoothing software miscommunication, extending the course
calendar by three weeks and providing training for mentor teachers
in students' high schools. But Forbes' guidance counselor, Noreen
Bradbury, said that even in their present form, the online courses
were a godsend.
</P>
<P>
   She said she already had 11 students signed up to take advanced
courses next year in history, statistics, psychology, government
and economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It opens the world to our kids,'' she said. ``They're not
distant and different from everyone else out there. They're as
good.''

<P>
   When the parade season comes to Portadown, Northern Ireland, the
Orange Order wears two uniforms _ one of black-suited and
bowler-hatted respectability and the other a T-shirted and
ski-masked thuggery exemplified this year by the terrorist Johnny
Adair. The Orange leadership in town needs to repudiate the
violence orchestrated by Adair and make an unequivocal commitment
to a peaceful resolution of the parades controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The Orangemen, sectarian Protestants, say they merely want to
walk down the ``queen's highway,'' in this case the Garvaghy Road.
But Portadown sits on a faultline where the Protestant heartland
borders the South Armagh frontier. When Orangemen troop down the
road past Catholic homes, they personify an edgy Protestant
dominance.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholics might be willing to compromise, but the Orangemen
refuse to negotiate on the pretext that they will not deal with
Breandan MacCionnaith, spokesman for the residents and an Irish
Republican Army veteran imprisoned for trying to blow up the
British Legion hall in Portadown.
</P>
<P>
   The peace process is all about forgiveness and freedom for
political prisoners who no longer pose a threat to society.
MacCionnaith has been out of prison for 14 years and no longer
seeks to overthrow the government. Adair was released last
September and last month threatened to shoot Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA has done an effective job of keeping their killers in
check. When Adair interjected himself into the annual Portadown
controversy, the Orange Order did nothing to restrain him. Instead
they sanctioned a campaign that spread to Belfast, Adair's home
base, where Protestant mobs disrupted the city to an extent not
seen in years.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Orange leaders in Belfast are trying to find a solution,
but the local Orangemen have to step forward. In 1998, three boys
were killed 50 miles away because of Portadown-related violence;
last year, a woman was killed by a bomb in Portadown itself. The
Orangemen of Portadown should not wait for death to deescalate this
perennial and needless confrontation.

AMTRAK PLANS NEW LOOK, PASSENGER   GUARANTEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JACOB H. FRIES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To revitalize rail travel and achieve Congress-mandated
self-sufficiency by 2002, Amtrak is trying to change its image,
redesigning its brand logo, and offering riders an unconditional
satisfaction guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers who are unhappy with their ride _ regardless of the
reason _ will be entitled to a certificate good for free travel on
the national railway at the same cost, Amtrak officials said
Thursday. The offer began July 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want a second crack at pleasing passengers,'' said
Karina Van Veen, an Amtrak spokeswoman. We know not every trip is
going to be problem-free, but with this guarantee, we think we can
draw people who are tired of flight delays.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Veen said Amtrak is the only passenger transit provider to
offer such a guarantee. The program is modeled after Amtrak's Los
Angeles-to-Seattle ``Coast Starlight'' service, which has offered a
service guarantee for three years. In that time, only 17 passengers
out of 1.4 million requested a travel voucher, she said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Thursday's announcement, Amtrak unveiled its new logo
_ three parallel lines winding their way to a horizon. It replaces
the ``pointless arrow'' design, which had been Amtrak's trademark
since its creation in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Amtrak officials announced plans to add new
routes and to expand into package delivery. The high-speed ``Acela
Regional'' between Washington and Boston should be running by the
end of the summer, Van Veen said. It was originally scheduled to
begin at the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak, formed by Congress from a collection of failing
passenger railroads, is subsidized by the federal government. If
Amtrak is able to become self-sufficient, it will be the only major
independent railway in the world, Van Veen said.

GERMANY CHOSEN OVER SOUTH AFRICA FOR 2006 WORLD CUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Africa's dreams of hosting soccer's World Cup for the first time
were dashed Thursday when FIFA, the international federation,
awarded the 2006 tournament to Germany over South Africa in a
surprise vote.
</P>
<P>
   Though FIFA president Sepp Blatter had declared that it was
Africa's time to host the planet's most popular sporting event
outside of the Olympics, the 24-man executive committee chose
Germany by a 12-11 margin with one abstention.
</P>
<P>
   The loss, termed ``a tragic blow for Africa'' by South African
president Thabo Mbeki, was a bitter setback to a continent that has
had its nose pressed to the soccer's window for seven decades while
the sport's quadrennial showcase was staged elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament, which will be co-hosted by Japan and South Korea
in 2002, has been awarded 10 times to Europe, four times to South
America, and three times to North America, including the US in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it does have to be in Africa,'' Franz Beckenbauer, the
former Cup player and coach who headed the German bid, had conceded
before the vote. ``But it's a question of when. We have to ask, `Is
Africa ready?' Are they ready? I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The South Africans insisted they were. They already had nine of
the 13 required stadia in place and had planned to expand FNB
Stadium in Johannesburg from 85,000 seats to 110,000. They had
Blatter's outspoken support. And after rival Brazil withdrew on
Monday, pledging its help, the South Africans thought they had the
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, which hosted the Cup in 1974, was a decided underdog in
the final weeks of campaigning since England was expected to split
the eight European votes. But when English hooligans rioted yet
again in Belgium during last month's European championships, it was
a killer blow to England's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most FIFA insiders felt history and geography would swing
the vote to Africa. Though Germany led, 10-6, after the first
ballot, South Africa drew even with 11 votes apiece after Morocco
was eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   When England followed, the South Africans thought they were
assured of victory. Had New Zealand's Charles Dempsey voted their
way, as the South Africans claimed he'd promised he would once
England was out of contention, the tally would have been 12-12 and
the tie would have been broken by Blatter. When Dempsey abstained,
Germany prevailed by one vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised,'' acknowledged Beckenbauer. ``I'm not prepared
for this because you can't be prepared for this. It was a very
close result. We'd hoped for this but we couldn't expect it. We are
very, very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory was a huge emotional boost for Germany, whose famed
soccer team has dropped to Third World levels since the 1998 World
Cup. ``You are the soccer idiots of Europe,'' the newspaper Bild
mocked after the squad returned home winless and humiliated from
the European championships.
</P>
<P>
   As hosts, however, the Germans should put on a first-rate
tournament. Sixteen of their cities _ most notably Berlin, Munich,
Frankfurt, Hamburg, and Cologne _ already have suitable stadia,
plus one of Europe's best rail and highway systems. ``We will show
our guests in 2006 that Germany is a country open to the world and
hospitable,'' chancellor Gerhard Schroeder vowed Thursday in
Berlin.

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - First they buy a Porsche Boxster or a Baja
performance boat.
</P>
<P>
   Or both.
</P>
<P>
   Then they call the financial planner.
</P>
<P>
   The wave of wealth that has washed over the Austin tech
community the past three years has set in motion a dizzying display
of consumption, from cars and boats to homes so large the owners
might not set foot in all the rooms in a year.
</P>
<P>
   But after all of that spending usually comes a propensity to
save, to plan for kids' college educations or early retirements or
the desire desire to travel.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Kozun and Daniel Tapia of Axa Advisors LLC., who count among
their clients dozens of tech millionaires as well as builders,
developers and restaurateurs who have gotten rich off of Austin's
hot economy, offer a five-step plan for the instant millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   1. Set goals. Kozun recommends a vacation away from all
electronic distractions, like radio, television and telephone to
assess short-term, mid-term and long-term goals. ``Imagine the life
you want to live,'' Kozun says. Among considerations might be trust
funds for children, charitable giving or life insurance. And for
some people, early retirement.
</P>
<P>
   2. Get your team together. Hire an accountant, a tax attorney
and a financial adviser. Ask friends and colleagues for referrals.
Interview several to find someone with whom you can communicate.
Don't rely on the Internet for investing advice.
</P>
<P>
   3. Talk with your new team to refine goals and priorities.
Consider three areas: income taxes (try paying as little as
possible while converting stock options to safer investments);
estate taxes (plan to avoid paying high estate taxes after death by
setting up charitable strategies or trusts); and investment
diversification (provide yourself with an income stream for the
rest of your life).
</P>
<P>
   Most tech millionaires, whether they work at Dell Computer Corp.
or
</P>
<P>
   Vignette Corp., became wealthy through company stock. An
oft-repeated refrain from financial advisers _ and one that's hard
for many millionaires to follow _ is to convert some of that stock
to more secure, long-term investments, like mutual funds or bonds.
``If you have stock options, you have sweat equity in that
company,'' Tapia says. An advisor can provide an unbiased, outside
opinion of how much company stock should be sold to meet financial
goals.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be too loyal, Kozun says. ``Don't treat your stock options
and your company like your 12-year-old dog.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A stock isn't like a bank savings account,'' he says. ``It can
go up as high as possible _ as high as your imagination _ or it can
go to zero.''
</P>
<P>
   4. Stick to your guns. Implement your plan and reassess it as
tax laws change and important life events occur.
</P>
<P>
   5. Don't watch the market every day; go to your annual or
quarterly reviews with your financial adviser, and live well.

 &HT;    Purple-haired,
 &HT;    regular guy millionaire Nate Hess lives just like you.
 &HT;    Except for the cars. And trips. And the $100,000 stereo.
 &HT;    By Robert W. Gee
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - In many ways, Nate Hess is the same person he
always was. He still refuses to buy his coffee at Starbucks because
he says they're too big and powerful. He stays up late at weeknight
concerts in crowded, smoky clubs. His music tastes are eclectic as
ever: One night it's jazz, the next it's punk industrial. He never
watches television. He still dyes his hair purple and wears six
earrings in his right ear and two silver studs in his tongue. He
works 60-hour weeks.
</P>
<P>
   You might not know it if you saw him sitting in the back of the
Continental Club, sipping a Guinness, wearing purple Chuck Taylor
sneakers, black jeans and a gray T-shirt _ the same outfit he wore
to work _ but Nate Hess is a millionaire. Hang out with him for a
few days, and you'll get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the purple hair, he's not too different from the
thousands of other recently made Austin millionaires who are
leaving a permanent stamp on the landscape of Central Texas. He's
relatively young (37) and free-spending. He's a techie who got a
job at the right company at the right time and is now sitting on
stock worth enough to start thinking about early retirement. He's a
California transplant who loves Austin's mix of fine dining and
Bohemia, live music and Birkenstocks.
</P>
<P>
   He's having the time of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what they say, 'the older you are, the better life
becomes,' '' Hess says, smiling gently from behind his brown beard
as he lounges in his downtown loft, a Dave Brubeck vinyl record
playing on a new stereo system that cost him just shy of $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Hess is one of the 17,000 new millionaire households that have
sprouted in the Austin metropolitan area over the past five years.
The number of total households in the Austin area with at least $1
million in net worth, excluding the principle residence, rocketed
to 30,700 in 1999 from 13,700 in 1994, according to the Spectrem
Group, a New York research and consulting firm specializing in the
affluent market. In the nation, there are 7.1 million households
with more than $1 million in net worth.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, according to the company's calculations, 68 of every
1,000 households qualif-- for millionaire status. That's slightly
less than Dallas and Houston, both at 76 per 1,000. In the San
Jose, Calif., metropolitan area, which would include much of
Silicon Valley, 129 of every 1,000 households are worth at least $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   An even more revealing picture of the accretion of wealth in
Austin is the rise in the number of households worth at least $5
million: to 2,500 in 1999 from 360 in 1994, a seven-fold increase.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of the stock market over the late 1990s and the growth
of the tech industry have helped fuel the accumulation of wealth.
Many of those who became rich watched as their stock options _ in
the beginning worthless contracts that represented partial
ownership in a private company _ turned into millions of dollars,
sometimes in a single opening day after an initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the market's recent tumble, many of these
millionaires, including Hess, seem to be doing fine.
</P>
<P>
   Hess is employee No. 36 at Vignette Corp. In the Internet and
software start-up world, the earlier the employee starts the more
options that can be acquired , which can translate into greater
wealth. Despite the fact that Vignette stock has lost roughly half
its value since its peak of $100.63 in March, many, if not all, of
the 330 people who worked at Vignette before its February 1999
initial public offeringare still millionaires today. Vignette has
been Austin's most lucrative IPO. Since the opening day, shares in
Vignette have split three times, including a three-for-one split.
</P>
<P>
   Hess still owns about 85 to 90 percent of his Vignette stock,
even though he has the right to sell almost all. (At Vignette, as
at many tech companies, employees can exercise the options to own
company stock over a four-year period.)
</P>
<P>
   He won't say how many shares he owns or what he's worth. But he
explained his wealth this way: ``Every individual has an amount of
money beyond which adding additional money wouldn't matter ... For
some people, it might be $10 million. For others, it's $50 million.
For others, it's $100 million.''
</P>
<P>
   For Hess, whatever that number is, he has arrived, he says.So
why keep working?
</P>
<P>
   For one, that magic number inches upward the more he tastes the
millionaire lifestyle. He also hasn't been at Vignette a full four
years, the point at which he will own all his original stock
options. And he's sure the stock will rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, Hess is happy as field technical director, a
position to which he was promoted last fall. Despite work weeks
that can stretch six days and 60 hours, he enjoys getting up in the
morning and heading into the office, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Hess strikes a casual and carefree pose worth noting even in
Austin. The fastest he's moved in weeks was likely on a recent
Sunday afternoon when he scampered from his outdoor seat at Little
City Espresso Bar &AMP; Cafe across Congress Avenue to his Plymouth
Prowler convertible so that he could raise the top just as it
started to rain.
</P>
<P>
   The nouveau millionaire moved to Austin in early October from
Silicon Valley, where he was one of the first people hired in
Vignette's sales office.
</P>
<P>
   No more bargain hunting
</P>
<P>
   Idle chatter around the espresso machine at Vignette, which
sells software to help companies build and maintain Web commerce
sites, often turns to early retirement, to life on the beach. Some
already have called it quits. Co-founders Ross Garber, 33, and Neil
Webber, 38, left the company and are now involved with civic and
philanthropic projects. A sales manager recently left and is
building a ranch in Lake Tahoe, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say you get bored if you stop working,'' Hess
says. ``But I've never talked to anyone who's stopped working and
is bored. If you're bored not working, you were probably bored when
you were working.''
</P>
<P>
   He thinks about the possibility of spending his days reading,
writing, listening to music, teaching high school math,
volunteering and donating to charities. He hasn't given away much
of his money yet: just some stock to his parents and two brothers _
enough ``to make a difference in their lives,'' he says _ and cash
gifts to his alma mater, Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   But he's found plenty of ways to spend it.
</P>
<P>
   First there was the purple Lamborghini Diablo. When he paid for
it last fall, he was struck by how small he had to write on the
check to fit in the sale amount. Then he bought the custom-made
stereo and in April, the purple Plymouth Prowler, a 1930s-style
roadster, for which he paid $40,000. All together, it's a change
from the 1981 Chevette that he drove cross country in 1986 for his
first job out of college at Intel Corp. in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   There have also been vacations Last summer, on a whim, he flew
to Berlin to see three performances by Tom Waits, a gravelly voiced
songwriter who spins romantic tales of drifters and drunks. That,
after seeing Waits in five shows in Oakland, Calif., and Los
Angeles. ``He's one of my favorite musicians,'' Hess explains
matter-of-factly.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the millionaire reserved a spot at Plaza Lofts, to be
built at Guadalupe and West Fifth streets. The units will range in
price from the high $200,000s to $2.3 million. It will be his first
home purchase.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, when Hess was married, supporting his first
wife and her three children from a previous marriage, he was
writing computer code for Campbell, Calif., start-up HAL Computer
Systems Inc., and living paycheck to paycheck. Hess remembers how
just a couple of years ago, he would price shop at bargain travel
Web sites to shave $20 off an airplane ticket. Now he doesn't think
twice about buying a ticket with a few days' notice, as he did two
weeks ago when he flew to California to see Bob Dylan and former
Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh in concert. He flew out with his
girlfriend, also a Vignette millionaire, and met up with an old
buddy, another millionaire who retired from Sun Microsystems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Hess attributes his financial success mostly to luck. Vignette
is his fifth start-up. Only one other gave him a substantial
pay-off from stock options _ ``on the order of annual salary kind
of money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He works hard like a school teacher works hard. He only happens
to have been rewarded in different ways. Just ask his girlfriend,
Lisa Stanley, 33, who went from making $30,000 as a high school
history teacher to becoming a millionaire at Vignette in less than
a year. She was hired in the sales department less than a week
before the IPO. ``Please, how lucky can I get?'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to make some money. I wanted some context, some
life experiences ... I never dreamed I'd be where I am now,''
Stanley says. She still rents an apartment in Northwest Austin but
is thinking of buying a house. ``It has to have a jacuzzi,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Hess, who signs his e-mail ``woodstock,'' after the Peanuts
character, and is typically esconced in his favorite color, purple,
prefers not to get philosophical about his sudden wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is a basketball player worth what they're paying him?'' he
asks. ``That's hard to say, but is the basketball player arguing?''
</P>
<P>
   Hess plainly justifies his new spending habits by explaining
that he's doing just as anyone else would do with millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it was buy the stereo you always wanted, get a couple
of cars, be able to travel more,'' he says. ``Other than that,
pretty much life's the same. I'm still a geek at heart.''
</P>
<P>
   But life has changed for Nate Hess.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the prospects of retirement before age 40, the
weekend jaunts to music festivals (two in May) and the Sunday
drives in a car worth $155,000, there is the artwork: Three Marc
Chagall lithographs sit on his apartment floor still wrapped in
boxes from a San Francisco gallery. He gets calls from friends
looking for a little seed money for start-up ideas. He gave $25,000
to one friend and considerably more to another.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the bare refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Hess eats all of his meals in restaurants. For dinner, he has a
semi-regular rotation with Stanley at the upscale Gumbo's and Jean
Luc's French Bistro, both within a half block of his Brown Building
apartment at Eighth and Colorado streets, where he pays $1,800 a
month for a one-bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've cooked a meal since I've been here,'' he
explains while munching on chips at Guero's, waiting for an order
of shrimp fajitas. His last trip to the grocery store, as he
recalls, was in December when he picked up six bottles of Odwalla
brand juice, flowers, fruit and a bottle of wine.
</P>
<P>
   In his new life, Hess says, ``cost pretty much factors out.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he insists, there is logic behind his extravagances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tend to only spend money on stuff I enjoy,'' he says. ``For
me, I enjoy music. So if I'm flying to Berlin to see Tom Waits,
it's worth it. I'm not going to buy 88 pairs of shoes just because
I can.''
</P>
<P>
   The young and the rich
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Hess has not squandered his fortune on cars or
paintings or shrimp etouffee. But his spending follows a pattern of
the young tech millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants the toys to go along with it,'' says Ed Kozun,
a financial adviser for Axa Advisors LLC, which helps techies and
other millionaires manage their money. ``For somebody who comes
from a background of not having a lot of money and it's suddenly
thrust upon them, they want that Lexus or that house in Barton
Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin's new tech millionaire class comes from a handful of
companies that have either held successful IPOs - like Vignette's -
or have been acquired for a lot of money. Agere Inc. was purchased
in January by Lucent Technologies for $415 million, and Charles
Schwab Corp. paid $488 million for CyBerCorp.com Inc. in February
</P>
<P>
   Often, like Hess, the new millionaires are young and enjoy fast
cars and nights out on the town. They are building mansions in the
hills and piloting big boats on Lake Travis. Consider the net
effect on the everyman: a tighter real estate market, higher cost
of living, longer waits for tables at restaurants, larger wakes at
the lake, more philanthropic spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole town is full of rich people,'' says Daniel Tapia,
manager of the Austin office for Axa Advisors LLC, which plans to
hire eight more financial planners by the end of the year to meet
demand. ``They could be wearing sandals downstairs. You can't spot
them like (in) other towns.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite the stock market tumble in April and May _ no Austin
tech firm emerged unscathed from the so-called market correction _
many of these millionaires are still millionaires. For those who
hitched their wagon to the wrong start-up and are still in search
of their dot-com fortune, there will be more start-ups, more
venture capital to burn and more wealth to create.
</P>
<P>
   ``Start-up action tends to grow exponentially,'' says Kim
Butler, president of Greywolf Consulting, a high-tech recruiting
firm. ``This type of money creates more opportunities. You'll see
more angels and independent investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Correction, shmorrection, says Hess.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of those bubbles have burst,'' he says. ``There are
people at Vignette and other places who said, 'maybe I'll wait a
while to buy a house,' but you don't get the feeling that they've
changed their lifestyle because the stock went down.''
</P>
<P>
   An unscientific survey of conspicuous consumption in Austin
seems to support his thesis:
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one homes valued at $1 million or more were sold in the
Austin area in May, according to the Austin Board of Realtors.
That's 300 percent more than last year. There are about 135
$1-million homes currently on the market. Sales at Lexus of Austin,
which also sells BMWs, are up 25 percent from last year. Austin
Boats &AMP; Motors Inc. has sold at least 15 family-style deck boats _
the maritime version of the Suburban _ for $40,000 a pop since
January, most of them since the stock market fizzle. That's
compared to three sold last year. And South Austin Marine has moved
about 10 performance boats, which range in price from $200,000 to
$400,000, since March, mostly to techies, in a pace on par with
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're looking for the high-end boat,'' says Kenneth Black,
one of the owners of South Austin Marine. ``Austin is just a
high-quality town. It's a Lexus/BMW/Mercedes town.''
</P>
<P>
   And a purple Lamborghini town.

MARINE MISCONDUCT IN OKINAWA PROMPTS A GENERAL'S APOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS for complete rewrite to restructure and streamline.)  
 By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ With a summit meeting of the world's industrial powers
opening in Okinawa in just two weeks, the United States was taking
no chances that more demonstrations against the U.S. Marines there
would mar the event.
</P>
<P>
   So even though no charges had been filed against a 19-year-old
Marine accused of molesting a 14-year-old girl in Okinawa on
Monday, the top U.S. military official on the southern Japanese
island went to the governor's office Thursday and apologized.
</P>
<P>
   He bowed. He expressed regret. And he tried, once more, to
smooth relations with the people of Okinawa, where widespread fear
and concern exists over crimes by U.S. soldiers, who have been
accused of numerous cases of violence and sexual misconduct through
the years.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Lt. Gen. Earl B. Hailston, visited Okinawa's
governor, Keiichi Inamine, at the prefecture government's office to
make the formal apology, which included a bow of Japanese
contrition. He was accompanied by the U.S. consul-general of
Okinawa, Robert Lake. Hailston is the regional coordinator for U.S.
military forces in Okinawa, where two-thirds of the 47,000 U.S.
troops stationed in Japan are based.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to express to the family involved, as well as to the
people of Okinawa, my sincerest apology and most profound regret
for the incident and for the anxiety it has created,'' said
Hailston. Hailston's apology was not the first by a U.S. official.
In 1995, Defense Secretary William J. Perry apologized on behalf of
America and three servicemen charged with raping a 12-year-old
Japanese girl. His apology, like Hailston's, came just before a
summit meeting in Japan. The servicemen were later convicted.
</P>
<P>
   In his apology Thursday, Hailston said: ``The relationship of a
Marine leader to his subordinate Marines is like the relationship
of a father to his children; these Marines are my sons and
daughters. That is why it hurts me deeply when any of my Marines
appears to fall short of the standard I have set and demand. It
hurts me, as it hurts you, my neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Japanese and Western historians have said that in the aftermath
of World War II, U.S. troops raped thousands of Okinawan women
without reprisals. The historians said that while hundreds of rape
cases have been documented, most went unreported for fear of
retaliation and shame.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This latest incident unfolded on Monday after a woman told
police that her daughter has been molested. The authorities accused
a 19-year-old marine of breaking into the girl's home and touching
her body while she slept. The marine, who is stationed at the Air
Station Futenma in Ginowan, Okinawa, was arrested at the scene on
suspicion of trespassing and conducting an indecent act against a
minor.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the Marine was drunk during the incident and that he had told
the police he meant to visit a friend's house but entered the
girl's residence by mistake. They said the door to the home was
unlocked, as is the custom of many Okinawans. The police officials
said the Marine has denied molesting the girl. Evening newspapers
in Okinawa reported Thursday that the girl had told the police that
the Marine had touched her face and body and climbed on top of her.
</P>
<P>
   Since Monday's arrest, labor unions, peace activists, women's
rights groups and human rights organizations have rallied near U.S.
bases and sent letters of protest to the prefectural government.
Some local city mayors canceled their scheduled appearances at a
Fourth of July celebration held at the U.S. consulate in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   The general's comments appear to have done little to quell
growing outrage in Okinawa over the incident, which could prove
extremely embarrassing to Clinton, who is scheduled to attend the
summit meeting of the G7 nations from July 21-23.
</P>
<P>
   Protest leaders vowed to hold follow-up demonstrations and to
use this latest incident to stir anti-base sentiment. The Peace
Action Center Okinawa, a group of union and progressive party
activists, plans to form a human chain around the Kadena Air Base
in Okinawa on July 20, the eve of the summit meeting of the world's
leading industrialized nations.

ARAB, ISRAELI LEADERS SET FOR TALKS FACE SKEPTICISM AT HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ As Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat prepare for next week's summit, they'll both
be carrying a lot of baggage.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders are saddled with popularity ratings that have
plummeted, internal political struggles that threaten their
leadership, and a generally exhausted population anxious about the
shape of the final peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The summit set to begin Tuesday at Camp David could be the
decisive moment in the endgame of the Israeli-Palestinian peace
process, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   But even if President Clinton _ who analysts say is doggedly
determined to make this a crowning victory as his presidency _ can
help Barak and Arafat hammer out the details of a final agreement,
the two leaders must return to the more daunting task of selling
the deal to their constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   Barak faces a fractious political coalition that was already
unraveling just hours after the announcement Tuesday of a summit.
Two key partners in his One Israel coalition, a Russian immigrant
party and the National Religious Party, announced they would pull
out of the coalition. That would strip Barak of his mandate, and
leave him with a 59-61 minority government in Israel's 120-member
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The defecting party leaders say they are opposed to the
concessions they expect Barak will make in returning land to the
Palestinians of the West Bank, which was captured by Israel in the
1967 Six Day War.
</P>
<P>
   And this kind of internal political battle over foreign policy
issues has been endemic not only to this peace process, but
throughout Israel's history. An observation by former Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger from the 1970s seems as applicable today as
it was then: ``Israel has no foreign policy, only a domestic
political system.''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat is struggling to control a restive Palestinian population
that has waited for six frustrating years for progress on
Palestinian self determination, the marking of borders of what is
expected to be an independent state, the return of refugees, and
the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
   Unrest in the Palestinian ruled areas has flared dramatically in
recent months. Usually Arafat has been able to control such
violence, sometimes even use it as a bargaining tool in
negotiations, but Israeli military officials say lately he seems to
have lost control of the growing popular anger.
</P>
<P>
   After six years of grueling stops and starts in the peace
process, the Palestinians have full or partial control of about 40
percent of the West Bank. Israeli newspaper reports say that Barak
may now be moving toward giving back as much as 90 percent of the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   This would mean having to evacuate a number of Jewish
settlements _ a lighting rod issue among religious extremists and
far right elements of the Israeli political landscape.
</P>
<P>
   And as Barak leans toward movement on the peace process, the
political dangers that surround him increase. A June 30 Gallup poll
published in Israel's Maariv newspaper, showed that Barak would
lose an election to his more conservative predecessor Benjamin
Netanyahu. The poll said that if an election were held today, 36
percent would favor Barak and 44 percent Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's popularity rating, according to polls published in
Israeli press reports, show him at an all time low of about 35
percent. But, for Arafat who presides over a rubber-stamp
Palestinian Authority legislative council, the problem is less
severe for Barak, who must survive in a system that is much closer
to a Western-style democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders' weakened political positions stand in contrast
to the last time Camp David served as an historic venue for a
Middle East deal. That was in 1978, when President Jimmy Carter
brought Israeli Prime Minster Menachem Begin and Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat together to sign the first Israeli-Arab peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   A key difference, analysts here point out, is that Begin and
Sadat were both confidently in control of their countries, and went
to the bargaining table with strong political backing.
</P>
<P>
   But even with solid support, peace makers always risk the danger
of extremists from within. Sadat was assassinated by a militant
Islamic group opposed to the peace deal. And Barak's mentor, former
Prime Miniser Yitzhak Rabin, was assassinated by a Jewish religious
extremist opposed to the framework agreement Rabin first signed in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of their relatively weaker positions or maybe as
a strategic move, both Barak and Arafat were busy Thursday trying
to lower expectations for next week's summit.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the chances for success, Barak told reporters,
``It is not possible to assess _ 50 percent, like the toss of a
coin.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said it was unlikely that
disputes over borders, the status of Jerusalem, the return of
refugees, and the fate of Israeli settlements in the West Bank
could be resolved in a few days.
</P>
<P>
   And he was already suggesting that more high-level meetings
would have to follow those that begin Tuesday in the Maryland
retreat.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of this moment in the peace process, when Clinton is
urging both sides to make the compromises necessary to end 52 years
of conflict, is that the two leaders actually could benefit
politically _ in the short-term _ by its failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Success is danger, and failure is not,'' said Zeev Chafetz, a
columnist for the English-language weekly Jerusalem Report.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Barak stands tough he could return as a hero who stood up
to the enemy and rebuilt his coalition,'' said Chafetz. ``And the
pressures are there for Arafat. I think if he comes back with a
deal that is seen as a bad deal, he could face more internal
problems.''

GORE SLAMS BUSH-BACKED MEDICARE PLAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Democratic presidential contender Al Gore on Thursday
accused his GOP rival George W. Bush of backing a Medicare reform
plan that would force senior citizens into managed care and
financially starve teaching hospitals, nursing homes and other
health care providers.
</P>
<P>
   In an address at a suburban senior citizens' center, Gore tied
his Medicare attack to his latest campaign theme _ that he is the
populist candidate fighting against a Republican opponent favored
by powerful interests such as the drug industry and insurance
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to a series of charts, Gore contrasted his plan to
pump $339 billion from the projected federal budget surplus into
Medicare with the proposals advocated by Bush, which Gore said
would put ``not one dime'' more into the federal health insurance
program for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not stressed health care in his presidential campaign
and only recently highlighted Medicare reform during a speech
largely devoted to Social Security privatization. The Texas
governor has said he supports a plan developed by a bipartisan
congressional panel that would curb the rising costs of the program
by letting seniors shop for a variety of private plans.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said, however, that the Bush-backed plan, opposed by the
Clinton administration, would put limits on how much the government
would subsidize health insurance premiums, which would force many
beneficiaries into lower-cost managed care plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would be financially coerced into joining an HMO,'' said
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic candidate said that he has earmarked $40 billion
of the surplus for health care providers such as teaching
hospitals, which have complained that they were hurt by a 1997
balanced budget agreement between Clinton and the GOP majority in
Congress. That budget pact helped extend the life of Medicare by
cutting reimbursement rates to health care providers.
</P>
<P>
   But a Bush spokesman responded that Gore had stood in the way of
ensuring the long-term future of Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Gore's charts and graphs can't hide the fact that the
Clinton-Gore administration opposed bipartisan Medicare reform and
submitted a budget to cut Medicare funding by $70 billion,'' said
Bush spokesman Dan Bartlett.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aide Sarah Bianchi said that Gore did not agree with the
scope of the president's proposed budget cuts for Medicare, and
instead proposed $30 billion in reductions to come from rooting out
waste, fraud and abuse in the program.
</P>
<P>
   As he has all week, Gore spent the day hammering hard on the
populist theme.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore, like Bush, comes from a prominent political
family and is the product of elite private schools, he sought to
portray his GOP rival as out of touch with the average voter.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told the seniors that ``in this election for president the
fundamental choice has to do with whose side are you on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am on your side,'' he said. ``I want to fight for the
people. The other side fights for the powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign responded by accusing Gore of ``attempting to
reinvent himself, this time as a class warfare warrior'' _ his
seventh campaign persona, by the Bush camp's count.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush's campaign is focused on bringing people
together while Al Gore is trying to pit one group of Americans
against another,'' said Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
   Gore continued trying to link Bush to the big drug companies, as
his campaign put out a release noting that Bush media consultant
Alex Castellanos was also working on a television ad blitz,
supported by the industry, attacking the Democrats' plan to
subsidize prescription drugs for the elderly. Gore has claimed that
the group, Citizens for a Better Medicare, is a front for the drug
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett said that while Bush employed Castellanos' firm,
National Media, to make media buys, Castellanos was not involved in
the creative side of the governor's advertising effort.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president later received a rousing reception from
members of the National Education Association, meeting in Chicago.
NEA, the largest teachers' union, has endorsed Gore.
</P>
<P>
   He told the more than 12,000 participants at the NEA convention
that he supports increasing educational funding and accountability.
Gore also received cheers when he told them that he opposes private
school vouchers.

`SCARY' A FRIGHTFULLY VULGAR SLASHER SPOOF

<P>
   If the baddest of the Farrelly brothers' bad-taste gags has you
in stitches, then this is the movie for you.
</P>
<P>
   For almost 90 minutes, director Keenen Ivory Wayans tries to
meld the pop-culture parodies of ``Airplane!'' and its ilk with
jokes so crude and outrageously raunchy that even Jim Carrey would
think twice. At a recent preview screening, a pocket of college
boys were not just laughing but actually hooting their
appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   I find ``Scary Movie'' neither scary nor funny, merely an
aggressively rude gallery of raunchy sex gags so extreme they at
times defy its R rating. Male frontal nudity, an erection turned
into an offensive weapon, a forest of pubic hair and a fire-hose
force of spewing semen are all major components of this teen
horror-movie spoof.
</P>
<P>
   From it's pre-credits lampoon of the opening scene of ``Scream''
with Carmen Elektra playing Drew Barrymore's doomed role (in case
we don't get it she's named ``Drew''), the film melds the
``Scream'' and ``I Know What You Did Last Summer'' franchises.
Cindy (Anna Faris), the professional virgin in a group of
hot-to-trot teens, is taunted by phone calls and threatening notes
while her friends are carved up around her.
</P>
<P>
   That's a dubious starting place, for the ``Scream'' films are
already smart parodies of the genre. To its benefit, the picture
opens up its scattershot targets to include everything from ``The
Sixth Sense'' and ``The Blair Witch Project'' to ``The Matrix,''
``The Usual Suspects'' and even ``Amistad,'' but the gags are more
hit than miss.
</P>
<P>
   The herky-jerky film, apparently the melding of two different
parodies into a single script (credited to six writers, including
Wayans' brothers and co-stars Shawn and Marlon), appears to have
been hacked and bent into its current form.
</P>
<P>
   More troublesome is the at-times angry tone the violence takes.
In one scene, an angry movie audience turns on an obnoxiously loud
patron, snatches the knife from the killer, and takes turns
stabbing and kicking the girl to a round of cheers. Wayans plays it
so sadistically its hard to find any humor in the malicious
spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of funny and unexpected moments in the film,
but they are ultimately swamped by the mean-spirited tone and
increasingly over-the-top raunch and drug humor. Wayans' target
audience may find that he pushes the envelope of bad taste enough
to mine laughs from sheer outrageousness, but I still like to see a
little wit in my pop-culture parodies.
</P>
<P>
   Scary Movie. Directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans. Written by Shawn
Wayans, Marlon Wayans, Buddy Johnson, Phil Beauman, Jason
Friedberg, Aaron Seltzer. Cast: Anna Faris, Shannon Elizabeth, Jon
Abrahams, Shawn Wayans, Marlon Wayans, David Sheridan. Dimension
Films. 88 minutes. R for male nudity, sexual suggestion, drug use.

BITTERSWEET AFTERNOON FOR THE WILLIAMS SISTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The ice cream truck didn't pull into Centre Court
Thursday, and Little Sister Serena didn't get her treat.
</P>
<P>
   Close, but no Eskimo pie. No Wimbledon title shot. No step up to
No. 1 in the family tennis pecking order. Big Sister Venus says she
always ``took care of my little sister, saw that she got her ice
cream. You know, little sisters, the babies, they get what they
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Not Thursday afternoon, as clouds and sunshine mingled in an
array that could be called bittersweet, the adjective 20-year-old
Venus Williams applied to her 6-2, 7-6 (7-3), triumph in the
much-anticipated intramural collision. Not when Big Sister was
keeping the sweets to herself and dealing bitter blows.
</P>
<P>
   Of course no good humor man wheels his ice cream truck with the
music blaring onto the grounds of the staid All England Lawn Tennis
&AMP; Croquet Club. Confronting such a spectacle, the Duke of Kent,
president of the club, might hemorrhage in blue.
</P>
<P>
   But in considering the long and unlikely way the sisters have
come, from a deteriorating neighborhood and a cracked, lumpy hard
court to a semifinal on the plush lawn of Wimbledon, Venus says,
``Maybe Compton (Calif.) isn't the most desired place to live. Not
in the top 100. But I still miss the ice cream trucks that came
around to the court. They were the best. I spent all my allowance
on Eskimo pies, ice cream sandwiches and popsicles.'' Their daddy
wouldn't let them have sundaes: ``Too expensive in those days.''
</P>
<P>
   Citizen Kane had his cherished sled called Rosebud. Maybe, for
these two millionaires, their Rosebud is an ice cream truck. London
bookmakers, and almost everybody else, made 18-year-old Little
Sister the favorite _ you got 11 if you put up 8 _ and even Venus
thought Serena, the US Open champ, deserved that role. But she
wasn't averse to taking the popsicle away from the baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was fun!'' Venus exulted as she came off the court to the
cheers of 13,812 parishioners in the venerable tabernacle of
tennis. ``We put on a great show. I ran faster, served harder than
ever before.'' Her eyes glittered. She was high on making the
second major final of her life, almost three years after being
flattened by Martina Hingis in the first, the US Open. She had her
eye on Saturday and the champ, Lindsay Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she'd showered and composed herself, Venus was
almost reserved at her press conference. She didn't want to give
even the slightest impression of great gladness at her sister's
great misfortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sad for Serena,'' she says, meaning it. They are as close
and important to each other as cards in a deck.
</P>
<P>
   Serena had wept and was sulking. `She takes losing harder than
Venus,'' says daddy, Richard Williams. ``It's almost like dying for
her. I congratulated Serena. hey both played good. But I had to get
her on the phone to her mama in Florida before she started to come
out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sibling rivalry goes back a distance _ remember Cain and Abel?
Although nobody got killed in Centre Court, there may have been
slight brain damage from which Serena will recover.
</P>
<P>
   Cain and Abel didn't draw much of a crowd. But what must it be
like to duel your sister with a bludgeon at 30 paces, trying to
slug her into submission in a full house, as the rest of the world
peers over your shoulder? This is not a picnic in the park. This is
common blood being let, and searing emotion overflowing, no matter
which way the contest goes.
</P>
<P>
   They'd done it four times at such way stations as Melbourne,
Rome, Key Biscayne, Fla., and Munich _ nothing as meaningful as
this one _ and it's going to happen many more times. Possibly they
can steel their psyches and treat each other on court as strangers.
Not yet.
</P>
<P>
   No semifinal at the Big W had stirred such great expectations
since Chris Evert made her debut here in 1972 and squared off
against the defending champion, Evonne Goolagong. Their initial
meeting lived up to the billing. Goolagong came from behind to win,
4-6, 6-3, 6-4, then lost her title to Billie Jean King.
</P>
<P>
   But that was well before the ogling that the world-roving eye of
TV gives everything. Serena and Venus bounded into everyone's
living room Thursday, heralding a new, bruising era. Though their
date with history lacked the suspense of Evert-Goolagong, the
sisters dabbed it with passages of brilliant firepower and superb
point-saving gallops across the paling green landscape that were
breathtaking.
</P>
<P>
   Venus galloped quicker, swatted more effectively, played the
must-points with greater severity and command. She seized four of
five breakers, made nine of 11 against her melt like a fizzling
rocket pop.
</P>
<P>
   Serena's five-win pleasure cruise to the semis, averaging 50
minutes per, amounted to a mere 13 games lost, just one on serve.
That had influenced a lot of people, including the bookies, but she
was playing flopsies and mopsies. Venus had been fired and hardened
by her finest win, a 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, quarterfinal in 2:14 over No. 1
Hingis. That showed. She was ready to take care of Little Sister,
though not as tenderly as in the ice cream days.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a horrible way to lose,'' Venus says sympathetically of
the concluding point: Serena's last serve at 3-6 in the breaker
wobbled like a lame duck and flopped quietly into the net. It was
like getting hit in the face with an ice cream pie. ``I couldn't
believe it was over. So abrupt. I wanted to keep playing.''
</P>
<P>
   And they will. This one may have ended with a whisper instead of
a bang, but there's an abundance of banging to come from the
flamethrowing sisters of no mercy.

ANIMAL ATTACKS IN NORTH WOODS FRIGHTEN NATURE LOVERS  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUEBEC _ A killer bear prowling Quebec's outback is panicking
campers and frightening droves of nature lovers out of the north
woods. The animal has taken only one victim, but Canada's great
bear scare _ heightened by lurid media reports _ grew into broader
public alarm over marauding carnivores after a wolf reportedly
attacked campers in British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Military patrols were dispatched into the forests north of this
historic walled city after one of Canada's leading female
biathletes was mauled to death Sunday on a popular hiking trail.
Traps baited with boiled molasses and rotted fish were set in hopes
of snaring the renegade bruin.
</P>
<P>
   A black bear was trapped Thursday, but officials said they will
not know if the creature is the killer until forensic examiners
compare its pawprints to those found around the woman's body. They
wll also use DNA tests. A bear caught earlier in the week was
released after investigators concluded that the 100-pound female
was ``too small, calm, and gentle'' to be the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Beth Miller, a 24-year-old athlete from Yellowknife,
Northwest Territories, was on a biathlon training run near the
Valcartier military base when she was attacked by what officials
deduce was a 200-pound male black bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``She defended herself and tried to escape,'' said Dr. Yvan
Turmel, the coroner who performed the autopsy. ``But the bear
attacked and attacked. She had no chance of getting away alive,
absolutely no chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Canada is teeming with bears, fatal attacks are rare.
The last in Quebec occurred in 1983, when a black bear slashed into
the tent of a 12-year-old boy and dragged him into the night.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife officials guessed that the bear either is suffering
from a brain disease or was startled by Miller pounding down the
forest path.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her running motion may have frightened him,'' said Dick
Russell, a biologist with the Canadian Wildlife Service. ``He may
have attacked in what he considered self-defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller's death by tooth and claw generated coast-to-coast
headlines and grim warnings from wildlife officials. The attack has
especially sown fear among the tens of thousands of backpackers,
canoeists, and other outdoors enthusiasts seeking adventure in
Canada's vast tracts of wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that girl got killed, we decided to fold the tent,''
said Ruth Greenberg of Cambridge, Mass., who with her husband and
two daughters, ages 11 and 13, quit a camping spot near the
Saguenay River for a hotel in Quebec's 17th century old town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll look at the historic buildings and eat ice cream instead
of communing with nature,'' she said. ``I'll leave encounters with
wildlife to the National Geographic.''
</P>
<P>
   The fear grew this week after a kayaker camping on a remote
beach in British Columbia was badly bitten in an apparent attack by
a timber wolf. After fellow campers chased off the beast, Scott
Langevin, 23, was transported by speedboat from Vargas Island to a
hospital in Victoria, where surgeons made 50 stitches to close
gashes on his head.
</P>
<P>
   Game wardens landed Tuesday on the island and shot two wolves
while wildlife experts puzzled over the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Bear attacks are not uncommon, although seldom fatal: About 40
people were killed by black bears in Canada and the United States
during the 20th century, according to Minnesota's North American
Bear Center.
</P>
<P>
   Canada has an estimated 400,000 black bears, which inhabit every
province and territory except Prince Edward Island. They infest
garbage dumps and are a nuisance in many national and provincial
parks. Some communities in Quebec dump spoiled apples, fish
entrails, and other delectables in wilderness areas to entice the
creatures away from suburbs and shopping malls.
</P>
<P>
   The species is found in New England, but usually sticks to the
backwoods of Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian athletes training in the outdoors frequently encounter
bears. Only two weeks before Miller was killed, a military officer
wheeling through the same section of woods on a mountain bike was
chased by a snarling bear.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was ranked among the top 10 Canadian women biathletes. A
biathlon is a grueling sporting event that combines target shooting
with cross-country skiing. She was expected to win a place on the
national team for the next Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bears are everywhere in Canada, it's part of our reality,''
said Olympic gold medal biathlon champion Myriam Bedard. ``There's
nothing more beautiful than training in nature. But there is
danger, too.''

   Imagine Gracie Allen playing private eye, trying to lay a Lauren
Bacall veneer of confidence and toughness over her priceless babble
of screwy punch lines. That's Emily Watson in Alan Rudolph's latest
genre bender, a ``screwball noir'' (by his definition) directed
with the quiet smoothness of a sophisticated romance.
</P>
<P>
   It's a strange mix for another of Rudolph's shaggy-dog stories
but then he's carved a most improbable career out of offbeat,
updated little genre pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, the versatile British actress of ``Breaking the Waves''
and ``Hilary and Jackie,'' plays Trixie Zurbo, a malaprop-spewing,
gum-chewing security guard whose nonsensical barrage of mangled
cliches and jumbled jargon suggests an over-medicated Humphrey
Bogart reciting Raymond Chandler from memory.
</P>
<P>
   Sent to a rustic third-rate casino, she falls in with bad boy
Dex Lang (an endearingly smarmy Dermot Mulroney), a shaggy,
small-time, would-be hood who is completely unfazed by her
delirious diction. Before long he pulls her into a mystery
involving smarmy, double-talking Senator Avery (Nick Nolte, with a
plastic grin and groping hands reaching for every woman in sight);
boozy past-her-prime showgirl Dawn (Leslie Anne Warren); and a
blackmail scheme involving a secret sex tape.

drinking himself to oblivion, who becomes Trixie's worldly pal and
Rudolph's wounded commentator.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph delights in dumping cliches on their heads, and this is
no exception, but what makes ``Trixie'' so much fun is not his
little narrative surprises (and frankly this mystery is less
hard-boiled than over easy) but the offbeat richness of his
characters. He embraces their foibles and gives his performers room
to invest them with a passion, a sense of being, and a
vulnerability that hints at a well of depth under their skin, deep
style and B-movie dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   In its own, unassuming way, ``Trixie'' is about how nimble
tongues and educated vocabularies can be so much more deceitful and
obfuscating than the sincere fumblings of people like Trixie and
Dex.
</P>
<P>
   With its gliding cameras, air of mystery and throwback soft-rock
score, it's a bit like ``Choose Me'' cast with buffoons, but at 117
meandering minutes, it's a long road with too many side trips. By
journey's end, there's little payoff beyond the time spent with his
strange and unusual out-of-time characters.
</P>
<P>
   In a summer of cardboard figures in splashy spectacles, that
makes for a refreshing change, an intriguing, entertaining and
altogether sweetly mystifying misfire. In other words, another
quintessentially Alan Rudolph picture.
</P>
<P>
   Trixie. Directed and written by Alan Rudolph. Cast: Emily
Watson, Dermot Mulroney, Nick Nolte, Nathan Lane, Brittany Murphy,
Lesley Ann Warren, Will Patton. Sony Pictures Classics. 117
minutes. Rated R for language and sexual situations.

   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA-$ADV09 _ ONI, Georgia _ High in still snowy
mountain passes separating Russia from its southern neighbors,
Chechen rebels have found a near
</P>
<P>
   impenetrable lair. From these hideouts, the rebels have
unleashed a new round of fighting their almost yearlong war against
the Russian army. The worrisome problem is that the rebels have
moved across the international border, to the Republic of Georgia,
threatening to escalate what Russia has always called a ``domestic
issue'' into a regional war. (Coker, Cox News Service). WITH

   BRITIAIN-CRIME-$ADV09 _ LONDON _ The crime rate has risen

   MEXICO-REVOLUTION _ MEXICO CITY _ It's being called the second
Mexican Revolution, the Revolution of the 21st Century, Mexico's
Velvet Revolution, the electoral earthquake. To the surprise of
virtually all political observers here, Mexicans rose up last
Sunday and decisively ended 71 years of domination by the world's
longest-reigning political party. In just one week, life in Mexico
has changed spirtually if not materially. Many people sense a
mantle of control has been lifted. A federal employee here who was
forced to pass out literature for the ruling party said she hopes
such coercion is dead in Mexico. A TV comic pushed the envelope on
freedom of expression by performing a sketch using amusing video of
President-elect Vicente Fox, and then bantering with the real Fox
in a live telephone interview. The audience went wild. Mexico is
enjoying a democratic fiesta, even though
</P>
<P>
   there are rumblings of how tough Fox's job is going to be as he
struggles to shape a new government here. (Ferriss, Cox News

   MEXICO-PRI _ MEXICO CITY _ The worst of times for Mexico's
freshly defeated ruling party included the 1968 student massacre,
several crippling peso devaluations and spate of fratricidal
assassinations. And now the ultimate _ unexpected defeat at the
polls of 71 years in power. Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary
Party is in the throes of a crisis, as its leaders squabble among
one another and stunned supporters wonder what will happen to their
special favors. President Ernesto Zedillo, who accepted the PRI's
defeat and won praise from abroad and the opposition here, is being
reviled within
</P>
<P>
   his own party as a traitor. The PRI will now be a minority power
in the Senate and Congress, and a minor voice in Mexico City and
other key areas. Can the dinosaur survive? (Ferriss, Cox News

   SURPLUS _ WASHINGTON _ Like Uncle Sam finding a $20 bill in the
pocket of his striped pants on laundry day, the U.S. government
last month came up with an extra $100 billion in revenue over the
next 10 years. While this boost in the projected federal surplus
certainly sounds like good news, it raises some disquieting
questions. How can revenue estimates change so quickly, and can
they go down as fast as they went up? And could the new revenues
lead lawmakers to create spending or benefit programs that would be
hard to roll back if the windfall evaporates? (Deans, Cox News
Service).

   BAXTER-COLUMN _ How would Southern politics change - or would it
change at all _ if we knew all the dire predictions about global
warming were really true? With all the scientific controversy over
that subject we can't be sure. But if there's one area which could
be looked at as a present-day laboratory for the consequences of
such an unprecedented crisis, it lies along the Carolina coastline.
That's because whether global warming affects it or not, there is
convincing evidence that over the next 30 years, storms like the
one which caused record flooding in North Carolina last year will
increase in frequency. That increases the potential like more
environmental disasters like the one last year in which North
Carolinians saw their rivers polluted with the carcasses of
thousands of drowned hogs. But it also brings a risk of political
disaster, as South Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges found out last year
when he ordered the coast evacuated for a disaster which didn't
materialize. (Baxter, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   TRANSEXUAL-MINISTER _ The Rev. Erin Swenson's heart thumped
wildly. She was so close to panic that her fingertips tingled.
Facing her, the crowd crammed inside the Shallowford Presbyterian
Church in Atlanta stared at her in disbelief. Swenson, an ordained
minister and father of two daughters, had just walked to the front
of the church in a green dress, heels and an eggshell-white blouse.
She was going to speak publicly for the first time about a
49-year-old secret that had driven her to thoughts of suicide.
Swenson told the hushed crowd that she was a woman born in a man's
body. Now that she had taken steps to correct that, she made an
unprecedented request before the assembly of Presbyterian church
leaders: Allow her to retain her ordination as a minister. Five
years later, Swenson is stepping back in the spotlight. She _ along
with , her ex-wife, daughter and father _ is are finally talking
about the extraordinary journey _ as a family and as individuals _
they have taken together since that autumn morning. (Blake, Atlanta

   CUMMINGS-COLUMN _If you find a regular alarm clock or clock

   COVER _ The idea seems obvious, so why didn't anyone think of it
before? ``Women get to accessorize with great shoes and handbags,
so why shouldn't our Palm Pilot covers and planners express who we
are and be fabulous also?'' asks Sunny Knox. The Dayton native, who
now makes her home in Los Angeles, theorized that women would be
anxious to replace ``black and boring'' accessory covers with those
more funky and fashionable. She figured right. Today Sunshine Knox
(her business card simply reads ``Sunshine'') is the president and
designer of Sunny Kate, a 1-year-old company that's already sold
thousands of items and is quickly becoming known for its upscale
accessories for women.

   ADAMS-YOSEMITE _ Yosemite National Park draws a whopping 3.6
million visitors a year _ making it one of the busiest sites in the
park system _ and many credit Ansel Adams' majestic black-and-white
photographs for its popularity. ``Every year I have to have an
Ansel Adams calendar of the park,'' said the Rev. David Johnson, a
Welches, Ore., minister. ``Now I want to see the vantage points
firsthand.'' The park plays to the fascination visitors have with
Adams by offering camera walks filled with basic instruction and
nifty details on where some of his classic images were executed. We
took the walk but also hiked independently, trying to view this
magnificent land in a way similar to the great photographer.

   ADAMS-PLAN _ Everyone who visits Yosemite National Park loves
its wide open spaces, yet, ironically, room to roam becomes

Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt recently unveiled a proposal for
Yosemite that would eliminate about 65 percent of parking spaces in
Yosemite Valley and reduce a lot of overnight accommodations.

cities in the Southeast are engineering new art museums or
expanding existing facilities in a major way. Just about everywhere
you look _ Biloxi, Miss.; Mobile; New Orleans; Raleigh _ some city
is looking to enhance its cultural calling card with art
repositories. Total cost of this building boom: an estimated $325
million. (Sabulis, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   EARLE _ Renegade country rocker Steve Earle is the last artist
one would expect to be a Savior. After building a reputation as one
of the most gifted _ and angry _ musicians in Nashville (and years
of herion addiction), he has become the icon of Americana music, an
eclectic collection of alternative country artists too esoteric for
mainstream radio. Earle's new album, ``Transcendental Blues,'' sold
20,000 copies during its first week of release, and remains at the
top of the Americana charts. He kicks off his national tour in
Atlanta on Tuesday, in a week loaded with Americana performances,
including Shelby Lynne and Jimmie Dale Gilmore. We talk to Earle
about the rise of alternative country, and the future of Americana
as a vital format. (Longino, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

away from the sport by high prices, late night starts and the greed

   WASHINGTON _ In picking a running mate, Vice President Al Gore
has two advantages over Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore gets to pick last, after he has assessed the political
impact of Bush's selection. And while neither candidate has deep
bench strength from which to choose, Gore, unlike Bush, does have a
standout possibility who would likely take the job: House Minority
Leader Dick Gephardt, veteran Democratic representative from
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   There are only two names that bring much to a Bush ticket: Gen.
Colin Powell and Sen. John McCain. Both are widely respected
moderates more popular with swing voters than Bush is. But Powell
has clanged the door shut on the vice presidency. McCain also says
he doesn't want it, but even if he did, Bush has sent hundreds of
signals that he doesn't want the independent, unpredictable
Arizonan.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond those two, Bush's alternatives are a pale, comparatively
undistinguished lot with as many liabilities as pluses.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore doesn't have a fat list from which to pick either, he
doesn't need it because Gephardt neatly fits the bill. Why look
elsewhere?
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt has been playing hard to get, saying publicly that he
would prefer to be speaker, assuming the House goes Democratic. But
he has not bolted the door as Powell has, and the implication hangs
in the air that if Gore asked politely, the answer would be yes.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt and Gore have been rivals for power for several
decades. They ran against each other for the Democratic
presidential nomination in 1988. They are similar in temperament
and equally politically skilled. But they do not really like each
other.
</P>
<P>
   Their hostility reached a peak in 1997 after Gephardt became fed
up with President Clinton's failure to help congressional Democrats
during his 1996 re-election campaign. Gephardt denounced the
administration's balanced budget deal and the immigration and
welfare bills, and he succeeded in defeating the president's
fast-track trade initiative. Gephardt's ``new progressivism''
agenda, aimed at countering Clinton initiatives, made him the
darling of what was left of the party's liberal wing and set him up
for a possible presidential bid against Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But stuff happens. Along the way Clinton fell from grace and
Gore consolidated his position as heir-apparent.
</P>
<P>
   So Gephardt went to Plan B, softening his criticism of the
Clinton administration and concentrating on electing a Democratic
House majority in 2000 with himself as its leader. He has since
been a team player except for his fights against international
trade agreements, which he lost.
</P>
<P>
   In the early reaction to Clinton's dalliance with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky, Gephardt _ whose own private life,
insofar as is known, is squeaky clean _ called the president's
behavior ``reprehensible.'' So did everyone else _ except Gore.
</P>
<P>
   As the impeachment process rolled on, however, Gephardt defended
the president, criticized GOP partisanship and led the
congressional drive to keep Democrats united behind the White
House. Since then, he has polished a strategy of partisan
confrontation, building a record of philosophical differences with
House Republicans on which Democrats can run in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout all this, Gephardt has kept a fairly low profile. He
is more of a work horse than a show horse.
</P>
<P>
   His relationship with Gore is now more comfortable than it used
to be. And Gore knows that if Gephardt joins the ticket, he will
understand how to stay in the background.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt would bring more than brains to a Gore ticket. Their
partnership would symbolize the coming together of the two wings of
the Democratic Party, the centrists shaped by Clinton and the
party's traditional liberals.
</P>
<P>
   Union members would be reinvigorated and newly excited about
working for the ticket. Gephardt carried their water on the trade
issues against the administration, and although he lost, they will
not forget. His presence might also help to neutralize Ralph Nader,
the Green Party's presidential candidate, who is trying to appeal
to the unions.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt could also help Gore capture Missouri, a swing state
that might be influenced by having a favorite son on the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   And the minority leader's finances seem perfectly in order. No
quickie deals on cattle futures.
</P>
<P>
   The down side of this dream ticket? The goodie-two-shoes
Gephardt tends to be boring. And Gore all by himself has already
captured the boring kingdom crown.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt, as a leader-in-waiting of the legislative branch,
would never be so undignified as to say publicly that he would take
the vice presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But we remember Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson, who had
his own presidential ambitions and vowed never to accept such a
lowly post. His mentor, House Speaker Sam Rayburn, told him, ``You
go home from the convention with something,'' and when John F.
Kennedy called, Johnson answered.
</P>
<P>
   Good thing for the country, too. Without Johnson to carry Texas,
Kennedy would never have been elected president. He won by only a
half a percentage point.

<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ A success in Friday's well-publicized test of
a missile defense weapon system, the Clinton administration claims,
will establish that national missile defense technology is ready
for deployment. But unfortunately, bagging the sort of precooked
and strapped-down chicken of a target that is being used Friday
will do nothing of the sort. If Americans want a real test of the
Pentagon's missile defense system, they should insist that it be
designed by someone other than the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department discovered a program-stopping flaw in its
system in tests three years ago: The system can easily be fooled by
decoys nearly as simple as the traffic cones we encounter on the
street or the Mylar balloons that are so popular at the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   The first response to this discovery was to try to conceal it.
Then the Defense Department dumbed down all the development tests
planned for the missile defense program so the somewhat different
version of the so-called ``kill vehicle'' that is now being used
would never have to be tested against competently designed, simple
decoys.
</P>
<P>
   In the near-vacuum of space where the missile defense would
operate, there is no air drag to cause light decoys to move
differently from heavy warheads, so it is relatively easy to create
cheap impostors. The Pentagon has stated that for the
100-interceptor defense system that President Clinton is likely to
recommend, the kill vehicle _ the interceptor that ``shoots down''
the incoming missile _ will have the primary responsibility for
picking out the warhead. Since all the objects the kill vehicle
will see are far away, they will appear as points of light _ like
stars in the night sky _ all moving in about the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the 10 objects that confounded the kill vehicle in
the first test, in 1997, Friday's test, like the two before it,
will use only a single mock warhead and a large balloon. The
balloon has been carefully designed to be nearly 10 times brighter
than the warhead, and the kill vehicle will be programmed to home
on the dimmer of the two targets.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon claims that the warhead and the ineffective large
balloon decoy it is testing against are representative of the
missile threat from an idealized imagined adversary _ an adversary
presumed to be capable of building intercontinental range ballistic
missiles, and nuclear warheads that are sufficiently light and
compact to be mounted on such missiles, but at the same time so
bungling as to be unable to hide the warhead inside a Mylar balloon
decoy released along with empty balloons or to build warhead-shaped
cone decoys.
</P>
<P>
   A recent technical study by the Union of Concerned Scientists
and the MIT Security Studies Program showed that the same simple
countermeasures that can defeat the kill vehicle could also defeat
all of the other sensors envisioned in the Clinton administration
plan.
</P>
<P>
   If every one of the currently planned national missile defense
tests proved to be an unqualified success, we would be still stuck
with a defense system that had not been realistically tested and
would have no hope of performing successfully in a real-world
attack.
</P>
<P>
   What the country needs, and what the president should give us,
is an independent commission of accomplished scientists who are not
connected to the Pentagon to look into the claims being made about
this ill-conceived national missile defense system. Before forking
over $60 billion to pay for such a system, Americans deserve an
answer to the obvious question as to whether it will work.

and dislocation continue, manifested in the doubling or even
tripling of the population of this ramshackle town, now home to
more than half a million people. Mostly people from the villages,
they are refugees who have abandoned their burned out homes and
have sought work and shelter in the capital. The Kosovo war forced
about two-thirds of the province's 2 million people from their
homes. Hundreds of thousands remain displaced, living in tents and

mine the genuine academic potential of the Internet. It took the
Clinton administration up on its pledge that there was educational
salvation in new technology, and that the Web could help the
poorest schools approximate the offerings of the wealthiest. But so

arrive alone, a solitary mother, wife or girlfriend there to

are the families of accused criminals and crime victims, and they
are all in some form of mourning. They often display remarkable
grace and loyalty, but in just as many instances, those families
that show up show a more fallible side. Fights break out.
Relationships in the process of coming apart unravel completely in

GORE DEMANDS ANSWERS ON MEDICARE FROM BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Asking repeatedly ``whose side are you on,'' Vice
President Al Gore on Thursday drew a sharp contrast between his
Medicare proposals and those of Gov. George W. Bush, branding his
likely Republican opponent the candidate of powerful industries.
</P>
<P>
   Gore lectured with charts and graphs at a suburban senior
citizens' center, seeking to put the debate over the popular health
insurance program for the elderly at the forefront of the
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would devote $339 billion to shoring up the program
over the next decade and adding a new prescription drug benefit for
all Medicare beneficiaries. Bush, he charged, had allotted ``not
one dime in his proposal for extending, strengthening, adding to
Medicare. Not a penny.''
</P>
<P>
   Time and again Gore threw pointed and detailed questions at
Bush, who rarely talks about Medicare. The governor has put forward
broad principles _ but little detail _ for creating more
competition between private and public health plans to overhaul the
Medicare program for the retirement of the Baby Boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to controversial questions about Medicare on which Bush
has not provided specific answers, Gore asked whether Bush
supported raising the Medicare eligibility age, or raising Medicare
premiums, or sending more Medicare recipients to health maintenance
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Medicare is important to you, these questions are something
you should know the answer to,'' Gore told the audience of the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also used a version of an old union organizing slogan about
choosing sides as he tried to frame the election. ``In this
election for president,'' Gore said, ``the fundamental choice has
to do with whose side are you on. I want to fight for the people,
the other side fights for the powerful.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's why the big pharmaceutical companies,'' he said,
``are supporting Governor Bush. That's why the big oil companies
are supporting Governor Bush. That's why the big polluters are
supporting Governor Bush. That's why the HMO's and insurance
companies are supporting Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally Medicare is an issue that plays to the advantage
of Democrats. So far this year it has not had the prominence in the
presidential race that Social Security has had, even though experts
say that it faces the possibility of insolvency earlier than the
retirement program does. Medicare provides health insurance for 39
million Americans who are elderly or disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign in turn accused Gore of practicing the
politics of class warfare. ``Governor Bush's campaign is focused on
bringing people together, while Al Gore is trying to pit one group
of Americans against another,'' a spokesman for Bush, Ari
Fleischer, said Thursday. ``We always knew the latest version of Al
Gore the positive wouldn't last long.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign also called Gore and President Clinton
obstacles to keeping Medicare solvent because last year all four of
Clinton's appointees to a bipartisan, 17-member group opposed its
chairman's ideas for overhauling the health care program. The
group, charged with finding a bipartisan solution to Medicare's
fiscal problems, was unable to agree on a final report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore's charts and graphs can't hide the fact that the
Clinton-Gore administration opposed bipartisan Medicare reform and
they submitted a budget to cut Medicare spending by $70 billion,''
said Bush's spokesman Dan Bartlett, pointing to some savings
Clinton had proposed for the program in his 2001 budget. He said
Bush would not support those reductions.
</P>
<P>
   But along with those savings, Clinton has also called for adding
an expensive new prescription drug program. Gore's slightly
different version of the prescription drug proposal would cost $255
billion over a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the bipartisan commission, headed by Sen. John B.
Breaux, D-La., fell one vote short of the 11 needed to approve a
final report intended to forge a consensus on how to overhaul the
program. Ten commission members, eight Republicans and two
Democrats, voted for major changes that would convert Medicare into
an arena for competition among public and private health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has criticized the Clinton administration for opposing
Breaux's plan. And the Texas governor's broad concepts generally
mirror those of the majority on the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux had proposed that the government, instead of paying
separately for each medical service, offer a fixed amount of money
to each beneficiary. The beneficiary could use the money to buy
private health insurance, through a managed care plan, or to enroll
in the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   He also proposed offering Medicare coverage of prescription
drugs as a new benefit, with the government paying for drugs for
people with incomes up to 35 percent above the official poverty
level. Health maintenance organizations and other private health
plans would have had to offer drug coverage to Medicare
beneficiaries, but they could charge extra.
</P>
<P>
   In other changes, Breaux's proposals would have gradually
increased the eligibility age to 67, from 65, charged higher
premiums to high-income people and required beneficiaries to pay 10
percent of the cost of home health care visits (there is no such
co-payment now).
</P>
<P>
   Gore has taken a different approach, shying away from the
efforts to turn more of the program over to private insurers. He
would use $40 billion of the surplus and $75 billion of savings in
interest payments from paying down debt to extend the life of the
program until 2030. He would create a $255 billion Medicare drug
program. He would also enact nearly $30 billion in savings.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told the elderly Thursday that he had opposed the Medicare
commission's report because he felt it would raise the eligibility
age, lead to higher premiums and push more people into health
maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett, Bush's spokesman, said the governor generally supports
the concepts of the Breaux commission. But he said Bush had not
said where he stood on the eligibility age, and did not believe the
plan would lead to premium increases.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not actually set out his own Medicare plan but instead
named six principles for change. He has said there should be no
increase in payroll taxes. And he wants Medicare to offer every
recipient a ``choice of plans including the option of purchasing a
plan that covers prescription drugs.'' He has said Medicare must
cover expenses for low-income elderly.
</P>
<P>
   His aides say he has earmarked $5 trillion over five years for
shoring up Social Security and Medicare, including providing some
kind of a prescription drug benefit.

IN MANAGED PERSONAL ACCOUNTS, A CHALLENGE TO TRADITIONAL FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 9) 
 By DANNY HAKIM    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bruce Hoelzen has not given up completely on mutual funds. He
still has a few Fidelity index funds, but he has sworn off actively
managed funds. These days, Hoelzen has four money managers buying
individual stocks for him, overseen by his own investment
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like cruise control on your car,'' said Hoelzen, 45, a
marketing consultant in Atlanta. ``You can drive if you want, or
you can put it on 70 and just sit there.'' Usually, he said, he
prefers to just sit there and leave it to the professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Meet the managed account, which many people view as the latest
threat to the 76-year-old mutual fund industry. It used to be that
only a privileged few could afford their own money manager, but in
the last few years assets in privately managed accounts have
swelled. Credit, in part, a bull market that has more than doubled
the number of millionaire households since 1983, to five million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest growth area is the managed account area,'' said
John Sharry, president of the private-client group at Phoenix
Investment Partners, which manages $66 billion in mutual funds and
private and institutional accounts. Households with $1 million to
$5 million to invest are the fastest-growing group he tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Not that you have to be a millionaire to qualify for a managed
account. Today, private portfolio managers serve investors with as
little as $50,000, but typically look for at least $100,000 in
investable assets. One reason is that technology now allows a
single investment professional to manage, in some cases, tens of
thousands of individual accounts.
</P>
<P>
   These managed accounts, known in the industry as ``wraps,''
because the various fees are combined, reached $451.9 billion in
assets at the end of March, up from $160.7 billion at the end of
1996, according to Cerulli Associates, a consulting firm. One type
is the mutual fund wrap, in which a consultant advises clients on
how best to spread their investments across a slate of funds. But
such accounts make up only about a quarter of the wrap market.
Privately managed securities accounts, also known as consultant
wraps, make up 58 percent of the wrap market, or $262 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That figure, of course, is well behind the $7 trillion in mutual
funds. But consultant wraps are seen as enough of a draw to the
fund industry's richest clients that many fund companies are
joining the business by offering the services of their top
investment managers through managed-account programs run by third
parties. In return, the fund companies receive a portion of the
annual fee, averaging 2.25 percent, charged by wrap accounts. (By
comparison, the average annual fee charged by mutual funds is 1.60
percent.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in five years every major mutual fund company will
also have a line of individually managed accounts,'' said Leonard
Reinhart, chairman of the Lockwood Financial Group, a consulting
firm, at a recent industry briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Most consultant wraps work like this: Clients visit an
investment adviser, whether a big broker like Salomon Smith Barney
or a small independent. With the guidance of an investment
consultant, clients then pick among scores of investment managers
from different firms. Usually clients spread their money into
several accounts and asset classes and then leave much of the
monitoring and managing to the consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the average wrap investor has a net worth of about $1
million and invests in a mix of accounts for diversification. At
most big brokerage firms, minimums don't come much lower than
$100,000. But a new batch of Internet-based financial companies,
like WrapManager.com and PrivateAccounts.com, are offering lower
minimums and lower fees for private accounts, though usually
without the additional advice of investment consultants.
</P>
<P>
   All of the programs allow investors to make direct investments
in stocks, in contrast to mutual funds. This lets clients avoid
particular stocks that they may already hold in other accounts. In
the case of Hoelzen, a client of Phoenix Investment Partners, he
alerted his consultant that he had worked for 12 years at IBM and
already had a big position in the stock.
</P>
<P>
   But the chief consideration for many clients, including Hoelzen,
is taxes, or how best to avoid them. One drawback of mutual funds
cited by managed-account boosters is that investors sometimes foot
tax bills that are instigated by others. For instance, if a
hot-performing fund suffers withdrawals, investors who stay are
stuck with a larger tax burden as the fund sells assets to meet
redemptions. Another problem is that investors may buy into funds
that turn out to be tax traps, because they already have large
taxable capital gains on the books.
</P>
<P>
   Such issues do not affect managed accounts; wrap clients can
also take defensive measures, like selling losing positions in one
account to offset gains in others, thus reducing tax bills. About
10 percent to 15 percent of Merrill Lynch managed-account clients
order their money managers to take tax-related actions during the
year, said Alan Sislen, an executive at Merrill who oversees its
separate-accounts program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really believe that clients have the best chance of success
if they go into these very disciplined programs,'' Sislen said.
They certainly work for Merrill _ its private account business has
more than doubled, to $52.6 billion at the end of March from $27.3
billion at the end of 1998. By comparison, the firm's fund unit has
suffered nearly $2.8 billion in net withdrawals in just the first
four months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Fund companies including Invesco, Munder Capital and Navellier
already offer the services of their managers through separate
account programs, and recently MFS Investments, Oppenheimer and
Pilgrim Baxter announced plans to enter the business.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the largest fund companies are noncommittal. While
Fidelity's brokerage unit offers separate account services, its
vaunted fund management team does not participate. A company
spokesman said Fidelity had no plans to introduce any such
services. Likewise, Janus Capital, one of the industry's hottest
money management firms, does not offer its management talent
through separate account programs. Nor does the Vanguard Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that you don't need separate accounts to get
diversification and tax efficiency,'' says Joel Dickson, a tax
expert at Vanguard. The firm's five tax-efficient funds, Dickson
says, are an alternative for clients sensitive to tax needs.
</P>
<P>
   But for Hoelzen, easy tax management is one of the best benefits
of his managed accounts. While he says he generally doesn't think
much about his accounts, he pays more attention in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, at the end of the year I'll ask them to sell every
loss position that's over $50,'' he says. ``You have considerable
control over your taxation, so I never get those checks with a huge
capital gains distribution.''

NORRIS COLUMN: AS PROFITS SOAR, CORPORATE AMERICA TAKES ON MORE
DEBT 
</HEADLINE>
   By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When things go great, the winners go into debt. Sometimes they
go too far.
</P>
<P>
   With the American economy in its longest period of expansion
ever, the news for corporate America has been as good as it can be.
Profits have soared and are at or near record levels by almost any
measure _ in dollars, as a percentage of revenues or as a portion
of national income. Investors eagerly paid unprecedented multiples
of those profits when they bought shares.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, with profits pouring in and investors eager to buy
stock, corporate America is deeper in debt than ever before.
Corporate debt now equals 46 percent of gross domestic product, up
from 38 percent five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   One might expect companies to pay down debt in good times, and
they tend to early in an economic recovery, when the bad times are
still fresh. Corporate debt fell in 1991, after the last recession.
</P>
<P>
   But as the economy continues to grow, such conservatism comes to
appear foolish as people grow more confident that good times are
here to stay. ``It's the perception of certainty that causes so
many prosperous companies, individuals and companies to get in over
their heads,'' says James Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest
Rate Observer.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that the richest of one era can end up in deep
trouble when times change. Mexico raked in the cash when oil prices
soared during the 1970s, and could not pay its debts in 1982.
Japanese corporations seemed to conquer the world in the 1980s, and
could not pay their bank loans a decade later.
</P>
<P>
   In the current corporate borrowing spree, the money borrowed has
been far in excess of what was needed for capital spending, notes
Paul Kasriel, the chief economist of Northern Trust. Much of the
money went to buy back stock _ in large part to offset the shares
that were issued to executives when they cashed in stock options.
Corporate America has bought back more shares than it issued in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is unprecedented. The two longest periods of
expansion before the current one were in the 1960s and 1980s. In
each case, corporate debt rose rapidly in the final years of the
expansion. In the 1980s, Drexel Burnham Lambert, the leader in
junk-bond underwriting, came up with a new measure _ the ``MAD
ratio'' _ to reassure investors that debt levels were not
excessive. That stood for market-adjusted debt, and it showed that
many companies were not really very far in debt, considering the
market value of their stock. That was great, until share prices
fell.
</P>
<P>
   Now, evidence is growing that the economy is slowing, and
worries are picking up that corporate profits may not be as robust
as expected. Credit markets are growing tighter. The junk bond
market is reluctant to finance many companies, and banks are
growing more cautious.
</P>
<P>
   If those trends continue, some companies that assumed they could
refinance debt when it came due will find that they cannot. And
then we will see corporate defaults and bankruptcy filings rise to
a level much higher than might be expected even if there is only a
modest slowing in economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, some of the companies that default will be ones that
need never have borrowed money, given how eager investors were to
buy their shares. But the managers feared that issuing too many
shares would depress the stock price, and they knew that their duty
was to maximize shareholder value. So they took on debts that did
not look dangerous _ but that proved to be fatal.

'BIG BROTHER' PROVES ANOTHER BIG HIT FOR CBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also TV-BROTHER-REVIEW, moved in `e' category.)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Big Brother'' was certainly big for CBS in its first broadcast
Wednesday night, scoring a higher rating for its first episode than
either of the two previous summer reality television hits, `'Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire'' on ABC and ``Survivor'' on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother'' pulled in 22.5 million viewers _ more than ABC
and NBC combined _ between 9 and 10 p.m, but the show did reveal
some signs that it may not have the kind of phenomenal appeal, at
least initially, that the other summer hits have demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ``Who Wants To Be A Millionaire,'' looking to revive
some of its own phenomenal edge, returned from two weeks of repeats
last night with an edition that featured the crowning of yet
another million-dollar winner, the show's fifth. And ABC held a
news conference Thursday to reveal that yet another million-dollar
winner would turn up within the next week on ``Millionaire,'' the
show that started the current trend toward reality formats imported
from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother,'' which throws 10 strangers together in a house
full of cameras, clearly benefited from being placed directly after
``Survivor'' Wednesday night. The tropical island adventure series
continued to smash every rating record for CBS in the summer. This
week ``Survivor'' reached its highest numbers ever among young
adult viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother'' impressively held onto most of those young
viewers and even improved on ``Survivor'' among viewers between the
ages of 18 and 34. But the show suffered falloff in terms of total
viewers during each quarter hour it was on, indicating some
possible boredom with the show.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Survivor'' the audience levels have consistently risen at
the half-hour mark every week. Last night ``Big Brother'' declined
by over a million viewers at the half-hour mark.
</P>
<P>
   Overall ``Survivor'' had a 15.1 rating (each rating point
represents just over a million homes) while ``Big Brother'' had a
13.9 rating.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers may have been expecting something different: the first
``Big Brother'' show was not typical of the usual format for the
series in that it filled most of the hour with feature profiles of
the 10 participants and spent very little time actually with them
inside the house they will share for the next three months.
</P>
<P>
   The show faced a bigger test Thursday night when it began on its
own at 8 as a half-hour show. This one was in its usual format: an
edited version of what takes place in the house over the group's
first two days together. ``Big Brother'' needs to keep up audience
interest levels because it will be on five nights a week through
September.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Millionaire'' meanwhile, a math teacher from Tennessee
named Kim Hunt won the big prize by knowing that Lesotho is a
land-locked country totally contained within another country. (The
other choices: Luxembourg, Mongolia and Burkina Faso.)
</P>
<P>
   He needed help from a friend on the $500,000 question: In the
1964 movie ``My Fair Lady,'' who dubbed the singing voice for the
character Eliza Doolittle? His friend knew it was Marni Nixon _ not
Julie Andrews, or Shirley Jones, or Roberta Peters.
</P>
<P>
   The executive producer of ``Millionaire,'' Michael Davies, said
Thursday that he decided to discuss the upcoming million-dollar
winners because ``rumors were rife'' about more contestants winning
the big prize.
</P>
<P>
   As for the fact that ABC held a news conference about
``Millionaire'' the same week CBS was starting ``Big Brother,''
Davies said he agreed to the idea somewhat reluctantly because he
certainly did not want any hint of implication that his show was
creating million-dollar winners to counter CBS's ratings surge this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had about 2 to 3 percent of our contestants win the
million and that seems about the right percentage,'' Davies said,
though he conceded that having two big winners in about a week
strains the statistics a bit. Defending the overall level of
questions the show is asking, Davies said, ``I feel clearly a
contestant has to have a fair chance at winning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor'' has been compared with ``Millionaire'' mainly
because ABC initially tried to use the game show to stunt the
ratings growth of the adventure series. But Davies has been
effusive in praising the CBS show.
</P>
<P>
   Regis Philbin, the host of ``Millionaire,'' joked Thursday that
when ``Survivor'' first beat ``Millionaire'' in the ratings, ``I
sobbed that night.''
</P>
<P>
   But he later said he had seen only one ``Survivor'' episode
``and all they were doing was throwing spears at a banana.'' He
said he decided, ``It's just not for me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor'' continues to be especially successful with young
adult viewers, the audience that CBS has had most trouble reaching,
and the audience that many advertisers pay a premium to reach. It
was up 10 percent among viewers 18 to 34 and 12 percent among
viewers 18 to 49 from the previous week, and in both cases had more
of the viewers in those groups than all three other big broadcast
networks combined. &QL;

BILL SENDS A KIND OF HUSH OVER BOND FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 9) 
 By ABBY SCHULTZ    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do not be put off by how eye-glazingly abstruse the subject
sounds: A bill making its way through Congress to change how
government-sponsored agencies like Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are
regulated could, if enacted, have some profound effects on the
portfolios of millions of ordinary investors.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the legislative details. The Main Street bottom line
is this: The agencies' bonds may stop being regarded as an almost
perfect equivalent to ultrasafe Treasury bonds at a time when the
supply of real McCoy Treasuries is contracting sharply. Such a
change would be hugely disruptive to bond mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   More than one-fifth of all assets in government bond funds _
$26.5 billion worth _ are actually Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt,
according to the most recent data from Morningstar Inc. Taxable
bond funds keep one-eighth of their assets, or $65.5 billion, in
these issues; pension funds and 401(k) plans also hold big chunks.
The two agencies' total outstanding debt of $908 billion has always
been treated as if it were entirely risk-free, since the Treasury
was sure to prevent any default.
</P>
<P>
   Now Rep. Richard Baker, R-La., is pushing a bill to put much
more distance between the agencies and the taxpayer. While it would
not push the agencies entirely from under the government's wing _
they would keep their exemptions from taxes and security
registration rules, for example _ the bill would call into question
the implicit government guarantee of their bonds that Wall Street
has always believed in. Without their special status embodied in
current law, the bonds may suddenly be off limits to many current
holders.
</P>
<P>
   Under current regulations, for example, banks can hold unlimited
amounts of the bonds. Government figures cited by Baker show that
more than 4,000 banking institutions have more money invested in
them than they have capital _ a concentration that would be
considered unacceptably risky if not for the agencies'
unimpeachable credit. No administration could permit a default, the
thinking has always been, if so many banks would be imperiled.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill calls on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and
the Federal Reserve Board to study banks' agency bond holdings,
which totaled $210 billion in mid-1999, and to consider imposing
limits. If the banks are forced to reduce their holdings, or merely
to stop being active buyers, the bottom could fall out of the
agency bond market. Others, like money market funds, that may hold
only the safest, most liquid securities may also have to sell.
</P>
<P>
   If the selling trend develops, the ripple effects may be broad.
Banks and other holders forced to dump the bonds may have to
scramble to find enough Treasury securities to replace them,
heating up demand in an already tightening market. Meanwhile, as
agency bonds lose favor and their yields rise, they may crowd out
high-quality corporate issues or depress their prices.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Baker acknowledged that changes caused by his
bill, if imposed abruptly, could be disruptive; he said he would
recommend they be phased in over several years.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also repeal the Treasury's authority to buy up to
$2.25 billion in agency debt. This liquidity facility, as it is
known, was meant to ensure that the agencies could obtain funds in
a crunch. It has never been used, and may no longer be enough to
matter much in a crisis, but its symbolic importance is great.
</P>
<P>
   The agencies' top-of-the-scale credit ratings would not
immediately be threatened by the bill, according to officials at
the two big credit-rating agencies, Moody's Investors Service and
Standard &AMP; Poor's. And Baker said he believed that if the agencies
remained well managed, their ratings would stay high. Nonetheless,
the door to a future downgrade would be opened.
</P>
<P>
   Stanislas Rouyer, a senior analyst at Moody's, pointed out that
the agencies' standing grew out of the deep and intertwined
relationships with the government that the bill is intended to
curtail. And Michael DeStefano, who follows the agencies for
Standard &AMP; Poor's, said any signal from Congress that it intended
to expose the agencies to more market discipline could erode their
special status in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   A change in the agencies' credit ratings ``would roil the whole
fixed-income market,'' said Scott Mather, an executive vice
president of Pacific Investment Management, a money management
firm. ``There'd be so many portfolio readjustments,'' Mather added.
``There are a lot of high-quality funds that just own agency
debt.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if the bill passes, Mather said, a downgrade for the
agencies is very unlikely. ``They are just too big and too
important to have that happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Jeffers, a Fannie Mae spokesman, is concerned that the
bill jeopardizes the agencies' ability to raise capital cheaply and
to pass along savings to consumers through affordable mortgages.
``We don't think it makes any sense to isolate one of the many
tools Congress gave us,'' he said, ``because if you do, you are
quietly or unintentionally unraveling the whole mechanism.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the markets are sensitive to every twist and turn in the
legislation's progress. In March, when Treasury Under Secretary
Gary Gensler lent support at a subcommittee hearing to some aspects
of the legislation, including repeal of the liquidity facility,
prices fell sharply.
</P>
<P>
   The bill remains a long way from becoming law. Baker expects it
to be approved by the subcommittee he heads before the end of the
current term. But he does not see it moving much further until
after the election decides which party will control the next
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The hearings on the bill, however, have put the agencies' status
in play, and have aired concerns that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
have grown too big and too concerned with profits, rather than
fulfilling a public mandate to keep home mortgage money plentiful
and affordable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the real goal is just to have Fannie and Freddie come
to the negotiating table,'' said Casey Colton, a bond fund manager
at American Century Investments. ``There is some concern that the
agencies believe that their mission is almost a manifest destiny to
control a huge portion of the market.''

DEFLATING THE PROMISE OF FOREIGN DIVERSIFICATION

<TEXT>
<P>
   On behalf of financial planners, academics, investment advisers
and self-anointed experts everywhere, I apologize. It appears that
much of what you have been told over the last 30 years about the
benefits of international diversification has been greatly
exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, according to a new study, those benefits are less than
half as great as originally thought.
</P>
<P>
   The case for international diversification, having been
tirelessly repeated for decades, is now numbingly familiar _
especially to mutual fund investors, because funds have been the
preferred vehicle for achieving low-cost exposure to many foreign
equities. By allocating some of an equity portfolio to
international stocks, the argument goes, you can reduce risk
sharply without having to forfeit returns over the long term.
</P>
<P>
   Yadda, yadda, yadda. Indeed, diversification has come to be seen
as an insurance policy on your portfolio _ and one with no premium
to pay. The linchpin in the argument has always been the supposedly
low correlation between market movements in the United States and
those in foreign countries. When one of them is zigging, the theory
goes, there is a good chance the other is zagging. As a result, a
portfolio that combines domestic and international exposure should
be less volatile than one invested in only one or the other.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that the linchpin has a major structural defect:
The world's major equity markets tend to become highly correlated
during major sell-offs. As a result, international diversification
falters just as investors need its much-promoted benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The defect went undetected for many years, and it is easy to see
why: When comparing the overall performance histories of U.S. and
foreign markets, the two indeed seem rather uncorrelated.
</P>
<P>
   The defect becomes evident only when the markets' good and bad
months are examined separately. That is the approach used by
authors of a new study _ Kirt Butler, an associate professor of
finance at Michigan State University and the author of
``Multinational Finance,'' a popular college textbook
(South-Western Publishing), and Domingo Castelo Joaquin, an
assistant professor of finance at Illinois State University.
</P>
<P>
   To appreciate the importance of their findings, we must first
understand how to measure the correlation between two asset classes
of any kind. Researchers use what they call a correlation
coefficient, a number that ranges from ``+1,'' meaning that the two
assets have perfect, or complete, correlation, to ``-1,'' meaning
that they have perfect inverse correlation. A coefficient of zero
means no correlation whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   If U.S. and foreign markets tracked each other to the same
degree in rising markets as they did in declining markets, the
coefficient, of course, would remain the same. But that has not
been the case. The professors looked at U.S. stock market
performance, month by month, from January 1970 through June 1999,
then divided the results into three categories of equal size: The
months in which the market had the biggest relative declines
(compared with the previous month); the ``calm'' months, those in
which it rose or fell little; and the months in which it rose the
most.
</P>
<P>
   They found that during the months with big declines, the
correlation coefficient of American versus foreign stocks was 0.48,
more than twice as high as the 0.21 in months with big gains. Only
during calm periods was there essentially no correlation.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, a low correlation between American and foreign
equities is generally seen when the market is quiet _ precisely
when an investor doesn't need downside protection. And during
bearish markets, when an investor most needs that insurance,
international diversification provides the least protection.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, investors would want the highest correlation during
bull markets in American stocks. That is because upside volatility
is something to be sought. But even though the correlation is
higher in rising markets than in calm ones, it is still less than
half that of declining markets.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I hope the professors' research makes journalists
stop writing about the mysterious failure of international
diversification during market corrections. Such reports have been
all too predictable in the last decade. The professors' findings
don't mean that geographical diversification is without merit _
only that it is not the free lunch that has long been advertised.
</P>
<P>
   So what does all this mean for investors who diversify
internationally? More risk, for one thing. Because world equities
have turned out to be more highly correlated in bear markets than
experts had believed, internationally diversified portfolios have
been far more volatile than predicted. That, in turn, leads to much
lower risk-adjusted performance for such portfolios _ more than 50
percent lower, in fact, according to the professors' calculations
of the Sharpe Ratio, which relates performance to volatility.
</P>
<P>
   That poses a problem for investors: If they still want to
achieve the risk reduction they thought they were getting through
international diversification, they must forfeit a chunk of their
expected profits. In other words, what used to look like a free
insurance policy turns out to carry a hefty premium.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, if investors don't want to reduce their expected
returns, they will have to incur significantly more risk than they
previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   The professors' findings do not justify the elimination of
international diversification. The approach still makes sense, but
with reduced expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The study should also have the effect of shifting the optimal
portfolio allocations among various foreign markets. That is
because different national markets are correlated to different
degrees in down markets.
</P>
<P>
   By this measure, allocations should be reduced most in Germany
and Japan _ markets that are most correlated to that of the United
States during sell-offs. For a more complete list of the
bear-market correlations, investors can see the study at Butler's
Web site at http://courses.bus.msu.edu/fi/fi860/.

   Venus wins, and Williams sisters return quickly to sibling roles
</P>
<P>
   By
</P>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ For a moment Thursday, Centre Court was
quiet and Serena and Venus Williams were still, their heads bowed
on opposite ends at the All England Club.
</P>
<P>
   Almost in slow motion, the sisters walked to the net and clasped
hands over it. They exchanged weak smiles. Not until Venus put her
arm around Serena did it become obvious who had won their historic
Wimbledon semifinal matchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's get out of here, Serena,'' Venus told her devastated
sister, who was near tears.
</P>
<P>
   As quickly as that, they returned to their sibling roles and
left tennis behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always the big sister,'' Venus said. ``I always take care
of Serena. No matter what I'm always worried about her.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus collected her things from her chair, then grabbed a few
items Serena had left behind. Venus finally acknowledged her
victory by waving to the crowd as she and Serena walked off the
court without signing autographs,
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really bitter, but someone had to move on,'' Venus said.
``It was either going to be me or Serena. In this instance, it was
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Serena, the younger of the Palm Beach Gardens sisters at 18,
double-faulted on match point and lost 6-2, 7-6 (7-3) to her
20-year-old sister.
</P>
<P>
   Serena built a 4-2 lead in the second set and had three chances
to go up 5-2. But she collapsed there, losing 11 straight points to
fall behind again. In the tiebreaker, Serena went ahead 3-1 but
didn't win another point.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome didn't surprise Richard Williams, who took a
``four-cigarette walk'' around Wimbledon village during his
daughters' match.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serena hates to lose more than anything in the world,'' he
said. ``That's the one thing I was a little worried about. I
noticed in practice she was tightening up. I think Serena wanted to
win too much.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an uncomfortable match between lifelong best friends who
love competition but still struggle with everything playing each
other entails _ the attention, the mental aspect, the family
undertones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult because the pressure was always on,''
Venus said.
</P>
<P>
   She was referring to the tennis: Serena's big serve, powerful
groundstrokes and ability to run down almost any ball. Venus
presented the same problems. The result was an error-filled match
with brief flashes of brilliance on long, all-court rallies.
</P>
<P>
   But the pressure was apparent everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Even the 13,812 fans, who had been hoping for outstanding
tennis, didn't know for which sister to cheer. The sisters didn't
seem to know how to act, rarely looking at each other and not
celebrating good shots.
</P>
<P>
   And the so-called friends box instead was filled with business
associates, a coach and two new acquaintances _ singers Dionne
Warwick and Gladys Knight _ although friend and former player Zina
Garrison was an exception.
</P>
<P>
   Mom Oracene Williams was home in Palm Beach Gardens, watching on
television because she was tired of traveling. Dad walked the
grounds before the match but left during it and returned afterward.
</P>
<P>
   He walked around Wimbledon with tabloid reporters trailing him
while he smoked, trying to forget that one of his two young
champions was eliminating the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a hard day for me,'' Richard Williams said. ``I
didn't go to sleep last night thinking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporters tried to ask his opinion of the match and give him
updates. He held them off until it ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard Serena had tears in her eyes and I almost had tears in
mine for my baby,'' he said. ``She takes losing harder than Venus.
It's almost like dying for her. I congratulated Serena. They both
played good. But I had to get her on the phone to her mama in
Florida before she started to come out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that he raised them for this day, starting on the
public courts in Compton, Calif., before moving to Florida to have
them train at academies and eventually alone on the courts behind
their home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at where they came from and where they are now,'' he
said. ``It's the greatest tennis court in the whole world. The
world is watching.''
</P>
<P>
   What the world saw raised questions with some about a ``fix'',
though many skeptics determined the occasion might have overwhelmed
the sisters _ leading to 36 unforced errors from Serena and 25 from
Venus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Venus was going to win the match, just for outside
reasons. But I don't think it was fixed at all,'' said Lindsay
Davenport, who defeated Jelena Dokic 6-4, 6-2 in the other
semifinal. ``It seemed like they were trying. Mentally, I think it
might be tougher for the younger one to beat the older one.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Williams had watched his daughters warm up on court
together Thursday morning and called their match just another step
on the road to his goal. That's something he shared with Venus and
Serena when he agreed to come to his first Wimbledon this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since you're asking me to go, I'll go,'' he told them. ``But
we're going to win the tournament. We are professionals. Play like
professionals. We didn't come to ring the bell. We came to take the
damn bell back to America.''

A FEW PORTS IN THOSE STORM-BATTERED INTERNATIONAL MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 9) 
 By VIVIAN MARINO    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors who thought they could lessen their risk by
diversifying overseas found little solace last quarter in
international equity funds, many of which underperformed their
domestic counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   The funds fell by an average of 6.28 percent for the period,
according to Morningstar Inc., compared with a decline of 2.91
percent for all stock funds in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A big reason was the 180-degree reversal of fortune for once-hot
technology stocks. Many of last year's stellar funds became this
year's laggards by loading up on high-priced foreign Internet and
telecommunications stocks that took a downturn during a highly
volatile period. Plenty of domestic funds did the same, of course,
but the problem was compounded for foreign funds by adverse
currency movements, particularly the euro's slide, that further
eroded their dollar-denominated returns.
</P>
<P>
   But a few international funds managed to beat the trend, mainly
by resisting dot-com temptations and sticking with undervalued
old-economy companies on the rebound. Among them were Pilgrim
International Value and Longleaf Partners International, which
invested primarily in middle- and large-cap stocks in Europe and
Japan, and RS Contrarian, which invested heavily in energy stocks
largely in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really looking through the trash that everyone else has
thrown out, trying to find undervalued companies run by people with
integrity,'' said Andrew McDermott, who helps run the Longleaf fund
along with Mason Hawkins of Southeastern Asset Management in
Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott and Hawkins, along with Charles Brandes, lead manager
of Pilgrim International and Andrew Pilara, a co-manager of RS
Contrarian, recently shared some of their stock-picking and
investment approaches for the quarter. They also discussed their
market outlooks for the remainder of the year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brandes, 57, who runs Brandes Investment Partners of San Diego,
submanager for Pilgrim International, says countries and industry
sectors do not matter when he chooses stocks for the $758 million
fund. ``Our secret is to buy good companies at bargain prices, no
matter where they happen to be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That approach brought Pilgrim International a return of 7.46
percent in the second quarter and 28.23 percent for the last 12
months.
</P>
<P>
   Brandes said he is a student of the Benjamin Graham-David Dodd
value approach to investing, detailed in the 1930s: To buy stocks
that trade at below-market ratios of price to earnings but that are
poised to climb.
</P>
<P>
   For Brandes, that means holding very few technology shares,
which account for just 1.8 percent of the fund's assets. Instead,
the bulk of the portfolio last quarter was in financial services,
consumer staples, durable goods and industrial cyclicals, mainly in
Europe with smaller portions in Latin America, Japan and elsewhere
on the Pacific Rim.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest contributors to his fund's performance, according to
Brandes, included Alcatel, the French telecommunications equipment
maker; Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan; and National Power,
the British electric utility. All three had good cash flow, and
their stock prices posted double-digit percentage gains in the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott, 31, and Hawkins, 52, echoed many of Brandes' views on
value. The bargain-hunting style, out of fashion in 1999, helped
the $300 million Longleaf International fund gain 10.11 percent for
the quarter, second best among international stock funds, and 14.05
percent for the last 12 months. But the Longleaf fund mixes in some
growth companies, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think we can separate value from growth,'' Hawkins
said. ``We care more about what value will build'' in a company.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott added: ``We don't have a quarterly strategy, and we
don't have an asset allocation strategy based on geography. We're
strictly bottom-up.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund's currency-hedging strategy also helped. The managers
match the expected foreign-currency earnings of their holdings with
short positions in those currencies, cushioning the fund from
exchange-rate fluctuations. ``It's one of the reasons our funds
held up in the second quarter,'' McDermott said. ``We don't take
foreign-currency risks.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also why the fund avoids investing in Latin America or
other emerging markets, where most currencies are too volatile to
hedge easily. The portfolio is concentrated instead in Europe and
Japan, and focuses on services, financial stocks, retailers and
industrial cyclicals.
</P>
<P>
   Among the fund's top performers, according to McDermott, were
Diageo, the giant British food and spirits company; Safeway P.L.C.,
the British supermarket chain; and Sampo Insurance of Finland.
</P>
<P>
   Diageo, whose many brands include Burger King, Haagen-Dazs,
Guinness and Johnnie Walker, ``was selling at the cheapest price in
its history,'' McDermott noted.
</P>
<P>
   Pilara, 58, found a few low-priced gems last year for the $100
million RS Contrarian, run by Robertson Stephens of San Francisco,
and much of the payoff came during the last quarter. As energy
costs have risen sharply in the United States in recent months, so
have the fortunes of many oil and gas companies whose shares he
accumulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's bad for the consumer is good for us,'' said Pilara, who
joined the fund's founder, Paul Stephens, two years ago when the
fund was mired in losses. Since then, Pilara has helped revamp the
fund's investment strategy by reducing its heavy concentration in
beaten-down industries like metals mining.
</P>
<P>
   Now, about 45 percent of assets are in energy, with the
remainder scattered in basic materials, communications, industrial
cyclicals, technology and elsewhere. Most of the holdings are in
Canada and the United States, Pilara said.
</P>
<P>
   The fund suffered along with other contrarian funds in the glory
years of the bull market, but it is starting to see daylight again,
gaining 10.22 percent in the second quarter, the best of any
international stock fund tracked by Morningstar. It gained 15.46
percent over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Among its top performers last quarter, according to Pilara, were
EOG Resources of Houston; Ivanhoe Energy of Bakersfield, Calif.;
and Anderson Exploration and Encal Energy, both of Calgary,
Alberta. All are involved in the production of natural gas, which
has soared in price recently, tripling on the New York Mercantile
Exchange in the past year. ``Everyone is talking about gasoline,
but we think there's a bigger problem with natural gas,'' he said,
referring to the sharp rise in its price.
</P>
<P>
   Though the energy stocks don't quite fit the fund's out-of-favor
criteria, Pilara said he had no plans to sell them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a contrarian fund,'' he said, ``and we're looking for
some more straw hats in the winter.''

COMMENTARY: A MODEST PROPOSAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the Democratic Convention around the corner, I would like
to join those offering advice to Vice President Al Gore. Gore's
next, and maybe last, best chance to re-energize his campaign will
come with his selection of his vice-presidential running mate, and
I know whom he should choose.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   No, really, think about it for a moment. Bill Clinton, with all
his detractors, is still the most popular and interesting
politician in the country, and he is a far better campaigner,
debater and all-around politician than any of the no-name
Democratic governors whose names have been bandied about as
possible running mates for Gore. While many voters won't admit it,
they would love to vote for Clinton again. He has kept us
entertained in this age of microchips and markets, and there is no
Democrat who drives Republicans more crazy. Without blinking an
eye, he takes 50 percent of all the Republicans' best ideas and
then accuses them of being extremists for wanting the other half.
What other Democrat can get away with that?
</P>
<P>
   Think of what Clinton could do to energize the Gore campaign: He
would certainly help Gore overcome his problem with women voters,
and, have no doubt, Clinton, who knows every issue inside out,
would destroy any Republican vice-presidential candidate in a
debate. For that matter, Clinton could eat George W. Bush for
breakfast in a debate and not even know he ate him. And, be honest,
who does a funeral better than Bill Clinton? That's the vice
president's most important task.
</P>
<P>
   Also, for pure entertainment, what could be better? The vice
president breaks tie votes in the Senate. So if Hillary Clinton is
elected as senator from New York and Bill Clinton as vice
president, they might actually square off on a key vote. We're
talking a ``War of the Roses'' kind of deal right there on the
Senate floor. C-Span would instantly become the most widely watched
television network in the country. Who needs ``Survivor'' when we
could have Clinton vs. Clinton _ live?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also solves another problem. He's already had his
background _ not to mention his body parts, body fluids and DNA _
checked by everyone from Paula Jones to the FBI. So Gore wouldn't
have to worry about any surprises coming out of his closet _ like
draft-dodging, pot-smoking, philandering or land speculating _
since the Clinton closet has already been opened and emptied twice
over. How many potential vice-presidential candidates can say
they've survived an impeachment inquiry? We're talking vetted here,
folks. Though Clinton may be disbarred in Arkansas (isn't that an
oxymoron?), he has never been convicted of anything. That should
count for something.
</P>
<P>
   And as taxpayers we have to love this idea, because Bill Clinton
for vice president is good for the budget too. Ex-presidents get
Secret Service protection for life. But if Clinton was Vice
President, he would get the VP's Secret Service detail and would
not need one of his own, so the country would save millions by
having to maintain one less Secret Service team. It's a two-for-one
deal.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that Gore and Clinton get along, so there
are no worries there, and there is also no question that Clinton
would love the job. First of all, he wouldn't have to move to that
Potemkin house in New York but could spend four more years in
government housing at the vice president's residence on
Massachusetts Avenue. Second, it would give Clinton a job, now that
he appears to be on the verge of losing his license to practice
law. And being vice president has got to be more fun than being on
the board of Disney. I mean, whom would you rather report to _ Al
Gore or Michael Eisner?
</P>
<P>
   It would also solve Clinton's golf problem. As a private citizen
he would want to join a private golf club, but that could be
difficult because few clubs want the hassle of having all those
Secret Service agents with sniper rifles sitting in trees and
roaming the fairways. But if Clinton was vice president no club
would turn him away from the first tee, and he would have much more
time to work on his game. Look how a good a golfer Dan Quayle is
today.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, yes. I know, Clinton-haters believe that Clinton should be
punished, not be made vice president. But aren't they the same
thing?

COMMENTARY: MOBY DICK ON A BROOM 
</HEADLINE>
   By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' is 752 pages long. Does
that sound a tad bulky for a children's book? The first three Harry
novels taught kids the joys of reading. The new one may teach them
the important adult skill of carrying around large and trendy
volumes of literature so you can say ``I just started it'' whenever
the topic comes up in conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night at midnight, ``Goblet of Fire'' goes on sale amidst
a hullabaloo the like of which Western literature has not seen
since Charles Dickens killed off Little Nell. Nearly four million
copies have already been printed for the American market alone, and
every single one of them has 752 pages. That is longer than ``The
Brothers Karamazov,'' and way, way longer than ``Moby Dick,'' even
if you don't skip over the parts about how to prepare blubber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goblet'' is even longer than ``Acheson: The Secretary of State
Who Created the American World,'' the book George W. Bush started
carrying around last year when questions arose about his
intellectual firepower. (It is doubtful that Bush read any 752-page
novels in his youth. When asked to name his favorite childhood
book, he once mentioned ``The Willie Mays Story,'' which he later
admitted was not actually a book. His other responses have included
his fourth-grade history text and ``The Very Hungry Caterpillar,''
which was written the year after he graduated from Yale.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Goblet of Fire'' may turn out to be so tremendous that
nobody notices the length, although personally, when I commit to a
book that long I want it to be something worth some serious credit,
like ``From Dawn to Decadence: 500 Years of Western Cultural
Life.'' (Actually, my husband is currently carrying around ``From
Dawn to Decadence,'' but everybody knows that large tomes read by
one spouse count as having been read by both.)
</P>
<P>
   Most people have already heard the story of how J.K. Rowling,
Harry Potter's creator, was a single mom living in an unheated
apartment in Edinburgh. The idea for the series came to her while
she was sitting disconsolately in a train that was stuck in a
tunnel _ truly an event to make us rethink the entire concept of
mass-transit delays. She envisioned seven books, which would follow
Harry through his years at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
Wizardry and into an inevitable battle with Voldemort, the rogue
wizard who killed Harry's parents.
</P>
<P>
   Many kids now regard literacy as a utilitarian skill, but
Harry's magical powers include winning some of these vidkids over
to the concept of reading for pleasure. Nothing warms the heart of
an adult more than seeing a child curled up with a good book. It
allows us to imagine that the younger generation is just a smaller
version of our linear selves, that their wiring is not completely
different, and that we could use the computers just fine if only we
curled up with something like ``Windows for Dummies.''
</P>
<P>
   The Harry Potter books have been on the best-seller list so long
now that it's clear adult sales must be helping to keep them aloft.
At 400 pages I liked Harry a lot, although I tended to dwell on the
accouterments of his parallel universe (owl-powered mail service,
potions exams, wizard trading cards) and skip over the plots
(dragon in the dungeon, werewolf in the classroom, Voldemort comes
ever closer). Rowling, however, appears to be into the story line,
which is going to get darker and more corpse-strewn with each of
the ensuing segments.
</P>
<P>
   She is now an incredibly rich and famous celebrity, seller of 30
million copies in 31 languages and clearly no longer a person to
whom an editor can suggest that 752 pages is a little over the top.
Harry is so popular that millions of strangers feel they have a
stake in his future, but it's probably not fair to deny his creator
her vision for the series, or even to carp about the movie deal.
(She has handed the film Harry over to Christopher Columbus, the
director whose greatest artistic vision thus far has been putting
Robin Williams in a dress.) Rowling created the characters, and she
has the right to kill them off (a ``beloved character'' is supposed
to die in this installment) or turn them into Happy Meal action
figures, if that's where her heart lies. But the sentimentalists
among us are going to mourn the days when Harry existed only in
books, which were smaller than breadboxes.

<P>
   In a new challenge to data storage titan EMC Corp., IBM Corp.,
and Compaq Computer Corp. are teaming up to win a bigger share of
EMC's core market.
</P>
<P>
   IBM and Compaq Thursday announced a strategic agreement to sell
each other's storage hardware and software products, and to make
them interoperable. That would mean that a corporate user of
heavy-duty IBM hard drives would be able to add Compaq drives to
his system by simply plugging them in. Much of the interoperability
testing will be carried out at Compaq's plant in Shrewsbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sets of products from both companies (will have) the
ability to interoperate, and this is a tremendous, tremendous
advantage to our customers,'' said Compaq chief executive Michael
Capellas.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Compaq will begin selling IBM's high-end
Shark storage products and Tivoli system management software. For
its part, IBM will sell Compaq's StorageWorks storage systems and
make use of Compaq's VersaStor system, which helps computers in
large corporate networks access data stored in a central storage
system.
</P>
<P>
   IBM and Compaq say they'll spend $1 billion between them to make
their products compatible. The two companies also committed
themselves to work with storage industry groups to establish global
standards for compatibility between all brands of high-end storage
devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly what we are all about is to help drive the
industrywide set of open standards,'' said Linda Sanford, IBM's
general manager of storage products. ``We want to accelerate the
efforts that are already going on in various industry standards
groups around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The IBM-Compaq initiative will also put the two companies in a
better position to compete with EMC, currently the world's dominant
producer of high-end data storage products. EMC held 27 percent of
the market for such products last year, according to International
Data Corp.; IBM and Compaq together held less than 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford said EMC's current line of storage products is
incompatible with storage equipment from other manufacturers. But
once IBM and Compaq have completed their compatibility program,
``you can feel safe as a customer going with each or any of our
products,'' Sanford said. This could make IBM and Compaq products
more attractive to companies that prefer to buy computer hardware
from more than one vendor.
</P>
<P>
   But EMC spokesman Mark Fredrickson was less than impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two struggling server vendors announced no new
functions, features, or capabilities today that a customer couldn't
buy last week,'' he said from the company's Hopkinton, Mass.
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Fredrickson said EMC is actively involved in the leading
industry groups working on open storage standards. He said EMC
products are already interoperable with storage systems from
Hewlett-Packard Co., and added that his company would gladly work
with IBM and Compaq as well, but that EMC wasn't asked.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Fredrickson said EMC welcomed open standards, saying that
EMC's storage hardware is so superior that it would still dominate
even in a market with full compatibility with rival products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that makes it easier for the customer to choose
products on merit . . . then the better technology wins,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   John McArthur, vice president of storage research at
International Data Corp., agreed that EMC is already quite active
in seeking to create industrywide storage standards.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the company lags far behind IBM in the design of
software that can be used to manage data storage networks running
many different brands of storage devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``IBM in particular . . . has a lot of experience in doing data
management in heterogeneous environments,'' said McArthur, and
Compaq will now have access to IBM know-how and products.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it helps both of them a little bit,'' said McArthur.
But he said the success of the alliance ultimately depends on how
well it is implemented. ``We started with the big group hug, and
now they've got to execute.''

`LONGITUDE': `WHEN' WILL TELL YOU `WHERE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
 By JULIE SALAMON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``For so long `Longitude' was my weird little story that no one
was going to read,'' said Dava Sobel, in a press release promoting
the new television version of her book. ``For me there is a sense
of disbelief about it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Sobel's ``weird little story'' about the scientific quest to
measure longitude has become an unlikely cottage industry: Her
184-page book, bearing the imprint of a small publisher (Walker &AMP;
Co.), became an international best seller after it appeared in
1995. It has been translated into more than 20 languages. Two years
ago, PBS produced a documentary adaptation called ``Lost at Sea _
The Search for Longitude.''
</P>
<P>
   This Sunday at 8 p.m. Sobel _ a former science reporter for The
New York Times _ completes her tour in Wonderland when A&AMP;E presents
a four-hour dramatization of ``Longitude,'' starring very serious
actors: Jeremy Irons and Michael Gambon. The film surprises, much
as the book did, by taking what might seem a worthy but dull
subject and making it sparkle.
</P>
<P>
   Much credit goes to the director and writer, Charles Sturridge,
who managed to remain faithful to the story's spirit while
reinventing it for another medium. He hasn't committed cinematic
cosmetic surgery, falsifying for mere prettification. Rather, he
has found a way to translate Sobel's lapidarian prose and complex
intelligence into more easily recognizable drama, without
oversimplifying.
</P>
<P>
   Like Sobel, the director wraps the narrative around the story of
John Harrison, the 18th-century carpenter, clockmaker and musician
who spent most of his life _ and much of his son's _ trying to
solve the problem of longitude. Shortly into the movie, the
filmmakers borrow the book's colorful and tragic example of why a
solution was vital. There is a shipwreck, caused by a navigational
miscalculation. The camera scans broken bodies splayed on the rocky
shore, giving a visual jolt to the flesh-and-blood aspect of this
scientific quest.
</P>
<P>
   While sailors before Harrison's time theoretically understood
what longitude was (the distance traveled east and west from a
fixed point), no one could accurately measure it because nature
offered no obvious place for the prime meridien, the zero-degree
longitude line. This was different from latitude, the north-south
measurement, which had the equator as its zero point. Thus latitude
could be plotted by calculating the length of the day or the height
of the sun or observing guide stars. ``Child's play,'' wrote Sobel.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry. You can enjoy the film version of ``Longitude''
even if you are an adult whose idea of child's play doesn't include
calculating latitude _ or even fully comprehending it _ much less
longitude. You just need to understand, even vaguely, Harrison's
breakthrough: He understood that measuring time accurately was the
key, while leading scientists of the day were certain that
astronomy held the answer.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers reduce Sobel's thorough explanation to a line:
``To tell one's longitude, you need to know the time aboard ship
and time at home port.'' In other words, you need a timepiece that
works at sea. It's not enough for a science exam, but plenty to
move the narrative along.
</P>
<P>
   Although the movie, even more than the book, concentrates on the
quest itself, it delivers an admirable amount of information about
18th-century science and politics, about the intricacies of early
watchmaking and even about the effect of centrifugal force on a
clock's accuracy. Heady stuff for a Sunday evening at home, yet in
this context, strangely moving.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers have also amplified the book's political
intrigues, underscored the relationship between Harrison and his
son William (played by Ian Hart) and added vivid scenes of
floggings, presumably to keep viewers alert and excited.
</P>
<P>
   To make the story more accessible, the writer-director Sturridge
gave one of Sobel's minor characters a starring role and then chose
a fine actor to fill it. Jeremy Irons plays Rupert Gould, the World
War I Royal Air Force veteran who rescued John Harrison's clocks
and history from oblivion. Gould's preoccupation, in turn, helped
him recover from a wartime nervous breakdown. With his soulful
voice and haunted intelligence, Irons beautifully conveys the
redemptive power of certain compulsions without overlooking what
can be ruinous in them.
</P>
<P>
   His exquisite neurosis makes a striking counterpoint to Michael
Gambon's earthy and barely combed Harrison, who always looks as
though something is unbuttoned somewhere. Gambon gives a vibrant
portrayal of a self-taught man for whom knowledge and intuition are
the same thing. He also doesn't separate the theoretical from the
practical. He wants to win the Longitude Prize (there actually was
one, the equivalent of $5 million today, because the British
government was so desperate to stop its ships from crashing into
rocks). But the money seems to be an excuse for him to continue
with his obsession.
</P>
<P>
   In Sobel's book, Harrison was at center stage and Gould occupied
slightly more than three pages, near the end. But Sturridge has the
two men share the spotlight. Gould is on-screen almost from the
beginning, acting as a narrator, and Harrison's legatee and alter
ego, even though they lived two centuries apart.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the constant shifts in time are confusing, as the
screen fills with period costumes and story lines from two
different epochs. Sometimes Sturridge seems to stretch the
parallels between the two lives (though, plausibly, the emotionally
unstable Gould might have become so absorbed in Harrison that he
began to see linkages everywhere).
</P>
<P>
   But in the main Sturridge deftly uses Gould to shine light on
Harrison's quixotic determination and to translate his
accomplishments for nonscientists. Gould did just this kind of
thing for the BBC, on radio programs aimed at children. Sturridge
uses one of these BBC broadcasts to give Gould the opportunity to
underscore the movie's central theme.
</P>
<P>
   It is the kind of explainer that, depending on language and
delivery, can either stop a picture cold or inspire a rush of
emotion, as complicated matters become clear. This speech works. In
the writing, Sturridge obtained elegant simplicity, and Irons
invests the words with enormous heart and meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking as Gould, in a gentle voice, he tells the children
listening to close their eyes and think a thought no one has ever
thought before, without paying any attention to anyone else around
them. ``Most of us with our eyes closed just see the dark,'' he
says. ``But the artist or the scientist can sometimes see something
new, something never thought of before. It's these ideas that can
change our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Those intersecting lines on the globe will never look the same
again.

   WIMBLEDON, England - It's hard to forget the image of Venus
Williams sitting under a black hood, morosely watching her younger
sister win the U.S. Open last year.
</P>
<P>
   That's why it's so easy to wonder if this round wasn't arranged,
if - because Serena Williams already has her first Grand Slam -
someone hadn't decided Venus' chance will come at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   Watching only the tennis, that might seem possible. Each time
one broke a service game, the other broke back. Serena won just
2-of-11 break points and lost her serve four times after not having
lost it at all since the first round.
</P>
<P>
   John McEnroe, who called the match for the British Broadcasting
Corp., floated the theory of a ``fix'' earlier this week. Players
have hinted they think the Williamses matches involve more than
tennis. Even Chris Evert, who called the sisters' match for NBC,
said she hopes it's all about the stronger competitor when Venus
and Serena play.
</P>
<P>
   And Richard Williams has been so omnipresent, outspoken and
outrageous that it isn't hard to believe he could manipulate
anything, including the outcome of his daughters' matches.
Certainly convincing Serena to throw the match for her big sister
would be simple, right?
</P>
<P>
   But not if you watched Serena's face.
</P>
<P>
   She looked bewildered, uncomfortable and she wasn't having any
fun, the same way she looks whenever she loses. She made calls with
her fingers, screamed ``No'' more than once and sometimes seemed
overwhelmed by her sister's game.
</P>
<P>
   She entered the post-match news conference wearing a ballcap
pulled low on her face. Her answers were terse. When asked if it's
more emotional to lose to Venus, she said, ``I don't think so.
No.''
</P>
<P>
   And her main feeling at the moment? ``I don't know,'' she
sighed. ``I lost in the semifinals of Wimbledon.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Venus' U.S. Open devastation all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Staging the match would be one thing. Staging the devastation is
a different story.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe, pointing out that both he and Evert played siblings
during their careers, had a different take after the match, saying
he didn't think anything had been ``fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anytime people get out on a Centre Court at Wimbledon
things can happen that you don't want to happen,'' McEnroe said.
``I can only imagine it's got to be very, very strange to be out
there. I don't care how many times they tell you it's another day
in the park.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, Venus couldn't have been happier or more
talkative. She described her protective role as big sister, her
sadness for her sister and how she wished they'd met in the final
instead of the semifinal. ``It would have been a lot more joyous,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   She complimented Serena's game, saying she played so well
because Serena pushed her, and explained how the loss feels for
Serena.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a real competitor, probably even more than I am when it
comes to losing,'' Venus said. ``She hates to lose. So that really
hurts her deep.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an arena like the Roman Empire,'' Richard Williams said
after the match. ``Where one person had the right to die and one
person had the right to live.''
</P>
<P>
   He has the match on tape and expects he'll eventually watch it.
But first, he'll concentrate on helping Venus win her first Grand
Slam, not to mention getting both sisters a doubles title. They
play Anna Kournikova and Natasha Zvereva in the semifinal today.
</P>
<P>
   Their eccentric father makes defeating second seed and defending
champion Lindsay Davenport sound easy, an issue of mind over
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Venus' party,'' he said. ``She didn't invite Lindsay to
it. Lindsay will get the same whipping Serena got.''
</P>
<P>
   Noteworthy: E.T. Dumas, a longtime coach of Venus and Serena,
had been talking with Venus for the past few days when she asked
him Monday to grab his rackets and join her at Wimbledon. Dumas
flew home to West Palm Beach and Wednesday night hopped a flight
from Miami to London. He showed up at the practice courts before
Venus and Serena played, but Richard was working with the girls and
told him to ``go get something to eat.'' Dumas, who worked
extensively with Serena before her U.S. Open title, expects to work
with Venus today.

A CALL FOR FAIR ACCESS TO FUTURE AIDS VACCINE 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa _ Though a vaccine to prevent AIDS is years
away, steps should be taken now to enable a vaccine to be
distributed widely in the third world as soon as it becomes
available, a leading group in the vaccine effort said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As the 13th International AIDS Conference prepared to open here
on Sunday, the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, a research
consortium supported by government and private grants, issued a
blueprint to provide simultaneous access to an AIDS vaccine in rich
and poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   The public and private sectors need to learn new ways of doing
business, the research group said in recommending sweeping changes
in the way vaccines are produced, licensed, priced, bought and
distributed.
</P>
<P>
   The group argued that economics alone fails to fully explain the
long delays that often ensue before vaccines become available in
developing countries and urged steps to harmonize the hodgepodge of
national regulations and international guidelines that govern
vaccine approval and use. The blueprint also calls for creation of
an international group to monitor and assess experimental vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not too soon to plan for an AIDS vaccine because failure
to act promptly would repeat the tragedy of the widespread lack of
availability to anti-HIV drugs,'' said Dr. Seth Berkley, the
president of the Vaccine Initiative, which collaborates with
Unaids, the United Nations' joint program on AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has concluded that AIDS threatens to severely
damage the economies of sub-Saharan countries like South Africa,
Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana and Swaziland where HIV, the virus that
causes AIDS, has infected at least 20 percent of adults.
</P>
<P>
   Most health officials believe a vaccine would be the most
effective weapon in stopping the epidemic. However, the most
severely affected countries would be the least able to afford a
vaccine, just as they cannot pay for anti-HIV drugs that are
helping extend the lives of many infected people in developed
countries. Also, many developing countries do not have the network
of health systems needed to deliver a vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely, if ever, have health officials introduced vaccines into
developed and developing countries simultaneously. Vaccine
manufacturers usually limit their initial production capacity for
markets in developed countries. Only with time and after production
capacity increases do prices fall to a level that poor countries
can afford.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, a delay of about 15 years has usually occurred between the
time vaccines for infections like hepatitis B were widely
introduced into developed and developing countries. The first
hepatitis B vaccine was developed in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and other developed countries quickly
organized systems to deliver polio vaccines in the 1950s. But it
took decades to conduct similar programs in countries with less
effective health care systems and polio was eradicated from the
Western Hemisphere only in the 1990s. The World Health
Organization's goal of eradicating polio in the rest of the world
by 2000 has been set back a few years.
</P>
<P>
   The delay in introducing vaccines to the third world is ``a
colossal public health failure'' that should not be repeated with
AIDS, Berkley said. He also said that with more than 5 million new
HIV infections occurring each year, a delay of five years in
delivering an AIDS vaccine could cost 20 million or more lives.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are challenged in developing an AIDS vaccine largely
because of the virus' ability to mutate. Two years ago, the
pipeline for AIDS vaccines was nearly empty. But today, the Vaccine
Initiative said, there are promising products in early development,
although there is still no plan to get any to the most affected
communities in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Margaret Heckler, then secretary of Health and Human
Services, promised an AIDS vaccine within a year. In the
intervening years, however, only three of 25 vaccines that have
been injected into humans have advanced to the second stage of the
three-stage testing system. Two are still in the second stage. One
is known as an Alvac canary pox vaccine and is made by Aventis
Pasteur of France. A second combines the Alvac vaccine and one
prepared from a molecular component of the surface of HIV, known as
gp120.
</P>
<P>
   A vaccine made by VaxGen of Brisbane, Calif., is the only one to
reach the third stage. VaxGen's product is being tested in the
United States and Thailand, and findings are not expected until at
least 2002.
</P>
<P>
   New techniques are needed to estimate demand for an AIDS vaccine
in developing countries and to ensure sufficient production
capacity because it takes five years to design, build and bring to
full capacity facilities to produce vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   An AIDS vaccine would be unlike most immunizations because it
would be accompanied by counseling to promote safe sex practices
and reduce risky behavior. Moreover, in the developed world, an
unknown number of people might decline an AIDS vaccine out of
concern that it might produce side-effects that would not appear
until years after the immunization. Also, some may shun an AIDS
vaccine because it would make the standard HIV blood test for a
recipient positive. Additional tests would then be needed to
document that the blood findings were from an AIDS vaccine, not
from infection with the virus.
</P>
<P>
   In the third world, there seems to be less concern about
side-effects because of the epidemic's severity.
</P>
<P>
   Even if coordination with the World Health Organization's
existing international vaccine programs produces maximum use of a
vaccine for AIDS, the Vaccine Initiative said, new delivery systems
will be needed to reach adolescents and adults at high risk of
infection. And the work to create delivery systems could cost more
than the vaccine itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Vaccine Initiative urged the World Trade Organization and
the major industrialized nations to create a tiered pricing
structure to help poor countries pay what they can afford and allow
companies to obtain a satisfactory return on investment.
</P>
<P>
   The research group cited support for the blueprint from Sean
Lance, chairman and chief executive officer of Chiron, a
biotechnology company in Emeryville, Calif., that seeks to develop
an AIDS vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chiron collaborates with researchers in South Africa
and has distribution agreements for other products with South
Africa, the company has vastly reduced its representation at the
AIDS conference because of concerns of personal safety in Durban, a
spokeswoman for Chiron said. Lance, a native South African, is not
attending.

VENUS WILLIAMS SURVIVES BATTLE OF THE SISTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ An unblinking Serena Williams watched her
final serve of the day as it crashed into the net and died in the
grass. Too stunned at the blunt end of the semifinal spectacle
Thursday, she hesitated to move, frozen in a worn patch on the
baseline.
</P>
<P>
   A double fault on match point. Once the reality of it nudged
her, Serena Williams pressed her fingers against her eyes to dam
her emotions and walked in the direction of her subdued big sister.
On the scoreboard in the corner, V. Williams had defeated S.
Williams, 6-2, 7-6 (3) to advance to the finals of Wimbledon, where
Lindsay Davenport will await on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday wasn't a celebratory moment for Venus Williams,
just the end to an awkward day. Before they exited beneath an
uneasy applause on Center Court, Venus Williams slung her racket
bag over her shoulder and then hovered over her crestfallen little
sister. She put her arm around Serena, helped her gather a few
items on the court, and whispered, ``Let's get out of here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always the big sister,'' said Venus Williams, who smiled
but remained restrained after advancing to her first final of a
Grand Slam since her 1997 appearance at the U.S. Open. ``I always
take care of Serena, no matter what. I always make the decisions.
I'm always a role model for Serena. I'm the big sister. I always
worry about her.''
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams dismissed the idea that this loss hurt worse
than another, but she appeared uncommonly crushed just moments
after the match. Glancing up from beneath a blue cap pulled low on
her forehead, Serena's eyes looked puffy and her voice shook when
she tried to explain what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected to play a lot better than I did today,'' she said.
``It was my goal to do better in this tournament, but that's OK.
I'm only 18. Venus is 20. I have a lot of years ahead of me.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Serena was the one many picked to win. She was the
sister with the sharper serve, the one with a more precise game.
She was the one who had grabbed a Grand Slam first, the one who
left her older sister's self-esteem in a puddle after winning the
U.S. Open. Thursday, Venus Williams was the one who left Serena in
shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a younger sister, and that's the way it is when you're
younger,'' Venus Williams said. ``You always get your way. Anyone
who has had a younger sibling knows that. When they don't get their
way, mom and dad step in and say, `Give her the ice cream.' As an
older sister or the older brother, you roll with the punches.''
</P>
<P>
   As unnatural as it seemed, Venus Williams had to take the match
from Serena. True to her nature, Venus remained cool and
unflustered from the outset. While Serena Williams desperately
tried to coax out her killer instinct by shaking her fists,
pounding her racket and smacking her thigh, Venus calmly pressed
onward with fewer mistakes. Of the 40 unforced errors made by
Serena Williams, too many came on pivotal points. Out of 11
break-point opportunities, she converted only twice. Venus Williams
converted 4 of 5.
</P>
<P>
   Serena held a 4-2 lead in the second set, but failed to convert
three break points on her sister's next serve. On all three
chances, Serena Williams lost control of a wobbly forehand. That
was just the beginning of trouble. Over the next three games,
Serena lost 11 straight points. Suddenly, Venus Williams led, 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Venus' last five matches, she didn't serve that well,''
Serena Williams said. ``That's the one thing I was counting on. But
she decided she was going to serve well today.''
</P>
<P>
   The tiebreaker proved it. When Venus Williams needed her serve,
she summoned it on cue. With a 4-3 lead, Williams unwound her
sinewy frame and lashed a 121 mph serve at her compact little
sister. Although Serena was able to muscle the blast back, Venus
Williams took the short ball and zipped it across the net at an
unreturnable angle.
</P>
<P>
   Through a fortnight marked with 50-minute matches, straight-set
victories and just one break of serve, Serena couldn't come up with
the same perfection against her sister. Her serve deserted her. On
match point, Serena Williams served her sixth double fault of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never double fault,'' said Serena Williams. ``Usually, I'll
play a tough three-set match and I'll hit one double fault the
whole match. Today, I don't know. I hit a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   That last double fault only underscored the anti-climactic
nature of the match. It was built up like a prizefight. For two
days, every element of the sisters' rise was explored, from their
days on the cracked courts of Compton, Calif., to the new home
Venus and Serena Williams just purchased. Through it all, Richard
Williams _ master storyteller, and eccentric architect of his
daughters' rise _ beamed with pride as he told every anecdote.
</P>
<P>
   But he wasn't around for what unfolded at Center Court. In the
private box next to the court, family friends like Gladys Knight
sat to cheer Venus and Serena on. The sisters' mother was in
Florida, and their father was taking a long walk. For most of the
day, Richard Williams strolled around the neighborhoods within the
two-mile radius of the All-England Club. He didn't watch a single
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was too difficult to watch,'' said Richard Williams, who
made his way to the grounds once the 1-hour-27-minute match was
over. ``I didn't see the point of it. There was a lot going through
my head. It was too difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The matchup was too strange. The way the sisters mirrored each
other's style _ bludgeoning the balls from the baseline, tracking
down every angle with their speed _ there was an element of
strategy missing. They knew each other's game almost too well.
Although there were riveting rallies, punctuated by mesmerizing
power, the match was pockmarked by too many errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serena and Venus both appeared nervous and didn't look happy
to be there,'' said John McEnroe after he called the match for the
BBC. ``There was no way for them to be totally comfortable. I don't
care how many times they say it, it wasn't just another day in the
park.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The crowd's response was unusual, as well. They were conflicted
by the circumstance. Not understanding which sister to applaud, not
knowing when a cheer would be insensitive, the spectators remained
hushed for most of the match. Once it ended, there was just a
gentle ovation. Nothing too raucous.
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams wouldn't have wanted a big fuss. She wasn't in
the mood to celebrate beating her little sister. It wasn't the
right time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really bitter,'' Venus Williams said. ``But someone had
to move on. It was either going to be me or Serena. In this
instance, it was me.''
</P>
<P>
   Next time, it could be Serena. Is there a family plan for the
sisters to alternate? In the end, there was scant evidence to
support the conspiracy theories. Upon match point, it was hard to
imagine Serena Williams manufacturing such a stunned and dispirited
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serena is a real competitor, probably even more than what I am
as far as when it comes to losing,'' Venus Williams said. ``She
hates to lose. So that really hurts deep.''
</P>
<P>
   When she saw Serena hurt Thursday, the big sister knew just what
to say: ``Let's get out of here.''

VERIZON GETS COMPETITIVE, CUTS PRICE OF DSL SERVICE 20% 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic marked its transformation to Verizon
Communications Thursday with a gift for its high-speed Internet
customers: a 20 percent cut in the price of its basic home digital
subscriber line service.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon, formed from the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE, said
both current and future customers for its 640-kilobit-per-second
service will now pay $40 a month instead of $50, as under previous
plans, plus $100 for a modem.
</P>
<P>
   The $10 reduction makes DSL more competitive with cable modem
services such as AT&AMP;T Broadband, which holds a big lead over
Verizon DSL in several of the 31 states where Verizon has a
landline presence.
</P>
<P>
   However, the maximum 640 kilobit download speed is still only 40
percent as fast as the maximum offered by AT&AMP;T Broadband, and DSL
is unavailable to people who live more than about two miles from a
phone company ``central office'' outfitted with the requisite gear.
Roughly half of Massachusetts central offices have been upgraded
for DSL.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a quality product, and for $10 more, you get
twice the speed,'' said AT&AMP;T spokesman Richard D. Jenkinson. In
Massachusetts and New Hampshire, the 1.5-megabit AT&AMP;T RoadRunner
service can be had for as low as $30 a month for people who buy the
modem rather than renting and also take cable TV.
</P>
<P>
   The DSL price cut announcement capped a day of nationwide
festivities launching the new Verizon brand name, which combines
companies that employ 260,000 people around the world and becomes
the largest local US phone company ahead of SBC Communications.
</P>
<P>
   The name comes from a combination of the word ``horizon'' with
``veritas,'' the Latin word for truth.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon officials said their service area includes 16.5 million
households that potentially could receive DSL, of whom barely 1
percent are estimated by industry analysts to have the service now.
</P>
<P>
   The company's local landline reach combines the Bell Atlantic
Maine-to-Virginia base with GTE's scattered local franchises in 28
states. Key GTE local service areas include metropolitan areas of
Dallas, Los Angeles, Tampa, Raleigh-Durham, N.C., and Seattle and
the state of Hawaii and Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   GTE and Bell Atlantic have also spun out their wireless
properties into Verzion Wireless, which covers 96 of the top 100 US
markets and has 29 million wireless and paging customers.
</P>
<P>
   In a Boston interview Thursday, Verizon vice chairman and
copresident Michael T. Masin said the company expects to take
several steps to close ``small gaps in our domestic footprint,''
which could include efforts to lease other Baby Bells' lines to
compete with them for local residential and business service.
</P>
<P>
   As a condition of federal approval for the merger, GTE had to
spin off most of its stake in Genuity of Burlington, Mass., the
former GTE Internetworking, a top Internet backbone carrier.
</P>
<P>
   However, Masin said, ``We think within two or three years
Genuity will be back in the fold of the Verizon family.'' To be
allowed to take back majority control of Genuity, Verizon must get
approval to be a long-distance phone carrier throughout the former
Bell Atlantic states.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year Bell Atlantic cleared that hurdle in New York
state and quickly grabbed nearly 1 million long-distance customers.
Last week federal regulators approved SBC as a long-distance
carrier in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Masin said he believes those steps have laid out a clear road
map for how Baby Bells must open their networks for local
competition to get approval as long-distance carriers. ``We think
we will do it'' in all Bell states ``within two to three years, and
we think the next one to do it will be Massachusetts'' before
year's end.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon shares closed down 62.5 cents at $58.8125 in New York
Stock Exchange trading.

AND THE LOSERS WERE ... JUST ABOUT EVERYONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 9) 
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mutual fund investors received a painful reminder last quarter
that there is a third way.
</P>
<P>
   In the long-running debate between fund managers who search for
cheap stocks and those who chase the fastest-growing companies,
neither side had any reason to cheer. The growth funds that
dominated for most of the long bull market for stocks flamed out,
but their value-seeking counterparts did not exactly soar from
their ash piles. A checking account turned out to be a better place
to stash cash than either broad category of stock fund.
</P>
<P>
   In a quarter when the average fund that invests in large growth
companies was down 5.2 percent, the typical large value fund was
was off 1.9 percent. As a group, value funds outperformed the
overall market for a change, but it would be difficult to build a
celebration on their meager return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they're breaking out the Champagne and saying,
`We're doing better than growth,''' said Michael Lipper, chairman
of Lipper Inc. ``They outperformed on a relative basis. The
question is, will value outperform on an absolute basis
sufficiently well to make it attractive? They're not going to get
new assets off these numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he noted, a few value-oriented fund managers, including
Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co. and Wanger Asset Management, agreed to
be acquired in the last few weeks, signaling that some big fund
companies saw growth prospects in value.
</P>
<P>
   Among investors, there were long faces all around as the average
U.S. diversified stock fund lost 3.1 percent of its value in the
second quarter after gaining more than 7 percent in the first
quarter. For the six months, the average stock fund was up 3.7
percent, a pace that is substantially off the historical return of
large stocks, 11 percent or so annually since 1926. And it pales in
comparison with the 19 percent annualized gain that the average
stock fund has racked up during the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Many funds that have led the pack for years stumbled during the
quarter, as technology stocks fell back to earth. Several funds
that had annualized gains of more than 35 percent over the last
five years lost more than 10 percent in the quarter, including
Fidelity New Millennium, RS Emerging Growth and Janus Twenty.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest losers among large funds were those with the
heaviest concentrations of technology stocks, especially shares of
Internet-based start-ups. Putnam OTC Emerging Growth, which raised
its technology position to 70 percent in 1999 and rose 125 percent
that year, lost 21.2 percent in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the three worst-performing stock funds in the quarter had
the word ``Internet'' in their names. The fund at the bottom of the
list was the Jacob Internet fund, managed since its December
introduction by Ryan Jacob, who previously managed the quarter's
third-worst performer, the Kinetics Internet fund. Jacobs' new fund
lost about 37 percent of its value in the quarter and is down
slightly more for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Staying far away from Internet companies and most technology
stocks was the key to success for many of the best-performing
funds. The biggest gains were in funds that focus on the riskiest
or most conservative of sectors. The 11 stock funds that gained
more than 20 percent in the quarter specialize in health care
stocks, especially biotechnology, or natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   The favored sectors of 1999, technology and telecommunications,
fell to the bottom of the rankings last quarter. Funds that
specialized in them lost more than 11 percent, on average. Between
those extremes were financial funds, which were down 1.5 percent
for the quarter, and utilities funds, which lost 5.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the Longleaf funds, managed by Southeastern Asset Management
of Memphis, an aversion to hot, new things and an unswerving
devotion to classic value investing paid off after a long wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not changed the way we do things for the 26 years that
we've operated,'' said Mason Hawkins, a co-manager of the $3.2
billion Longleaf Partners fund, which gained more than 8 percent in
the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Helped by buyouts of two companies it owned, Nabisco Holdings
and the Pioneer Group, Longleaf Partners gained almost 10 percent
in the quarter, ending a string of three losing quarters and making
it the top performer among mid-capitalization value funds. Hawkins
described the rebound as an inevitable market recognition of the
bargains in the portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest contribution came from its No. 1 holding, Waste
Management, the garbage-hauling company. With new management
tackling the company's accounting and computer problems, Hawkins
said, the stock rose 39 percent in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In past quarters, of course, some investors left value funds
like Longleaf's and chased the fast performance gains logged by
growth funds like those managed by Janus Capital in Denver. But the
flow has not reversed as once-hot funds have absorbed investment
losses in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The stronger showing by value funds ``gives some substance to
the value people who have this price discipline,'' Lipper said.
But, he said, he doubts that value funds will continue to
outperform simply because they own cheap stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are not cheap enough yet to bring out the arbitragers
and the raiders on any sort of mass basis,'' he said. Having money
spread around the world only compounded the woes of fund investors
last quarter. Every foreign stock fund category was a loser.
</P>
<P>
   International stock funds lost 6.3 percent, on average, breaking
a string of six quarterly gains. As a group, their return over the
past year of 25.8 percent, on average, was still better than the
19.2 percent for the typical diversified domestic stock fund.
</P>
<P>
   Several international funds hung on to 12-month gains of more
than 100 percent even though they dropped 13 percent or more last
quarter. Among them were Driehaus European Opportunity, BlackRock
International Small Cap Equity institutional shares and T. Rowe
Price International Discovery. Janus Overseas, with more than $10
billion in assets and an annual return of more than 30 percent for
five years, dropped 11.4 percent in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best-performing international funds in the quarter
were more conservative portfolios that specialize in finding
undervalued companies or in buying stocks related to gold or other
precious metals. Many of the worst-performing international stock
funds specialize in companies in Japan and other Asia-Pacific
countries. Among international stock funds with at least $1 billion
in assets, the worst return was a 18.9 percent loss from Putnam
International New Opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Europe was the least inhospitable region. Funds that specialize
in European stocks lost 5.9 percent, on average, but managed to
post a 37.5 percent gain over the past year. Diversified
emerging-markets funds dropped 11.7 percent, while Japanese-stock
funds lost 11 percent and funds that buy Latin American stocks lost
6.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among bond funds, emerging markets were the worst place to be.
The typical emerging-markets bond portfolio lost 1.2 percent. Most
other categories of bond funds had positive returns, except for
high-yield _ or junk _ bond funds, which lost 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most bond funds are showing positive numbers but not great
positive numbers,'' Lipper said. As interest rates rose, he said,
investors started to worry about the credit quality of some of the
bonds in riskier portfolios, especially those backed by mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   Although some convertible bond funds had 12-month gains of 25 to
40 percent through June 30, many of those suffered losses in the
quarter. One standout for the quarter, however, was the $81 million
Victory Convertible Securities fund, which gained 5.7 percent, and
15.6 percent in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the worst-performing bond funds in the quarter and
almost all of the worst performers over the last year fell in the
high-yield category. The PaineWebber High-Income fund lost more
than 10 percent last quarter and almost 16 percent over the last 12
months.
</P>
<P>
   Municipal bond funds cooled a bit after a hot first quarter,
gaining just 1.1 percent, on average. The best recent returns among
big muni funds were from the $1.50 billion Vanguard California
Insured Long-Term Tax-Exempt and the $1.39 billion Vanguard
California Intermediate-Term Tax-Exempt, both of which gained 1.8
percent in the quarter.

<P>
   DETROIT _ Imagine being a man of the '90s and not having a
single pair of khaki Dockers in your closet. Mazda found itself
similarly naked in recent years; without a sport utility vehicle,
it was missing out on the hottest auto fashion trend of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Mazda had, in fact, offered a sport utility, the Navajo, but
dropped it in 1994. At a time when buyers were clamoring for four
doors, the Navajo came with only two. It was, in fact, essentially
a two-door Ford Explorer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Mazda receives another sport utility from Ford, and
this one may have a brighter future. The Tribute is similar in many
respects to another new SUV, the Ford Escape, and along with the
Escape it has the potential to be best in class in a booming
segment of the car market.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of small sport utilities, or ``cute utes,'' have more than
doubled in the last four years, and further growth is expected both
in the United States and overseas. The Honda CR-V currently leads
the pack in sales, followed by the Toyota RAV4.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ford and Mazda recognized that they needed a small sport
utility and initially went their separate ways. Ford looked at
borrowing the underlying platform of the Contour and Mystique
sedans; Mazda considered the foundation of the MPV minivan and the
626 sedan.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the two brands _ Mazda is controlled by the Ford
Motor Co. _ came together. Mazda staff members took the lead role,
developing an entirely new platform that borrows little from
existing vehicles. Designed and engineered in Japan, the Tribute is
built at a Ford assembly plant near Kansas City, Mo. Production
capacity is a sizable 250,000 Tributes and Escapes a year, with
Mazda taking about 40,000 for the American market; it will also
build a right-hand-drive version in Japan. Ford will split the rest
of the production between the United States and 167 overseas
markets. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aimed at young singles, couples and small families on budgets,
the Tribute, along with the Escape, jumps to the head of the class,
at least for now, in size, refinement and substance. The four-door,
five-passenger Tribute is smaller than the former Navajo and
current Explorer but almost a half-foot longer than the current
Jeep Cherokee. The Tribute and Escape are the first of a new wave
of cute utes that are slightly larger and more substantive. The
next RAV4, due this fall, is larger than the vehicle it replaces;
the next-generation CR-V will bulk up; and even the Cherokee grows
when it is redesigned for next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Escape looks a little like a shrunken Explorer, and it has
the same outdoorsy style. Mazda aims for a more elegant appearance;
in fashion terms, the Tribute is gray flannel trousers while the
Escape, with its rugged-looking front fascia and plastic lower-body
trim, would be blue jeans. None of the exterior pieces are shared
except for the roof, windshield and side door glass.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same story inside; the two vehicles share few visible
components. The Tribute's dashboard and radio are similar to those
of the Mazda MPV minivan; the Escape has the black-on-white-dial
gauges of some Explorers. In keeping with its refined image, the
Tribute test vehicle (a top-line ES) came with leather seats, a
six-way power driver's seat and an excellent optional sound system,
a 190-watt, 7-speaker radio with cassette player and six-CD
changer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its compact exterior, the Tribute is surprisingly roomy
inside. Ford and Mazda say the pair have the most space in their
class. My passengers certainly had plenty of headroom and
sufficient legroom. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was also loads of room for belongings. The rear cargo area
has 33 cubic feet of space, more if the seats are folded down. The
cargo bay is tall enough to carry bicycles upright and wide enough
to transport plywood. The large rear opening and low vehicle height
make it easy to load bulky items. I hauled a fully assembled
computer desk inside the Tribute. The temporary spare tire is
hidden beneath the cargo floor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Tribute rides on a new unit-body platform. Its carlike
architecture delivers several advantages over sport utilities built
from truck components. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Getting in and out is easy, thanks to a low floor height,
generous door openings and beefy grab handles. With less weight
than in truck-style utilities, the handling is more nimble and
carlike and the fuel efficiency is better. The base DX model has a
2-liter, 130-horsepower 4-cylinder that comes only with a
five-speed manual transmission. It has an economy rating of up to
28 mpg.
</P>
<P>
   A 3-liter V-6, rated at 200 horsepower and paired only with a
four-speed automatic transmission, is likely to be more popular. It
comes on the ES and the medium-trim LX and is one of few V-6s
offered in small sport utilities. Its fuel economy is rated at 18
mpg. in the city and 24 on the highway, with or without four-wheel
drive. The V-6 versions, when outfitted with the optional towing
package, can haul up to 3,500 pounds. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I didn't haul anything, but the gold ES was plenty quick
accelerating from stoplights and passing on the freeway. Equipped
with a four-wheel independent suspension _ most SUV's still use
relatively unsophisticated live axles _ the Tribute maneuvers
around corners and rides smoothly like a car. It competently hugged
corners at higher speeds than I expected, yet kept passengers
upright and comfortable without much body roll. But more sound
deadening material would have been noise; the amount of road noise
coming through the floor reminded me of a truck.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from exterior appearance and interior appointments, the
Tribute rides and handles slightly differently than the Escape.
</P>
<P>
   Mazda advertising has positioned the Tribute as the sport
utility with a sports car soul. Commercials feature a Tribute
driving a slalom course around black Miata roadsters. The Tribute
does have slightly tighter handling and steering than the Escape,
but the differences are quite subtle.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its refined appearance, the Tribute is capable of
driving on muddy, rutted roads or over snowy pavement. All three
trim levels can be equipped with a new on-demand four-wheel-drive
system. In normal conditions, the Tribute operates in front-wheel
drive. When the system detects a loss of traction, the
four-wheel-drive system hydraulically transfers up to half of the
power to the rear wheels. A dashboard switch allows the driver to
lock the system in four-wheel drive on slippery roads. All the
shifting of power occurs seamlessly. There is no low range for
heavy towing.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribute's safety features include standard dual front air
bags and a new child-seat-latch system that will be required by law
next year. Side air bags and antilock brakes come as a $495 option
package.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribute starts at $17,520, about $600 less than the base
Escape. The LX starts at $19,655, about $1,680 less than the
comparable Escape. Fully equipped models will run around $25,000.
Mazda's pricing is more aggressive than Ford's in an attempt to
lure potential buyers into showrooms that had been devoid of sport
utilities. Now Mazda has the goods, and they are priced to sell.

   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Throngs of drivers, including some never
before behind the wheel, are lining up here to test three new
automobiles that arrived late last month amid a promotional blitz
comparable to a new-product introduction by Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   These vehicles, unavailable in dealer showrooms, do come with a
price tag: The $41 cost of admission to the Magic Kingdom at
Disneyland. The fresh body styles are replacing what might be
called a classic, a vaguely Ferrari-like roadster that puttered
around the ``freeways'' of the Autopia attraction unchanged for 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   The three new models _ one is like a mini-SUV, another vaguely
resembles a Volkswagen Beetle and the third is a Euro-styled sports
car _ are part of a remake of the Tomorrowland attraction,
sponsored for the first time by the Chevron Corp. The oil company
joins a long list of corporate sponsors at Disneyland. For Chevron,
the Autopia alliance was a natural extension of its own marketing
efforts; its television ads featuring animated talking cars.
</P>
<P>
   Since freeway driving is no longer a novelty, especially in
Southern California, Autopia is now intended as a ride through an
automotive fantasy world; statues in the ``park'' are
representations of historic autos.
</P>
<P>
   The fanciful body styles of the new cars are supposed to convey
a distinct personality, Weckerlin said. ``They are unique and
Disneyesque, not ones you'd necessarily see on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the two-seaters posed some design challenges. Besides
size constraints for the seat and headrest, the shell had to fit
over the old car's chassis, whose design had been perfected over 13
years of trial and error. ``We finally figured out how to build an
Autopia car to last forever,'' said Bob Gurr, the original
designer. ``We didn't want to mess with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the cars accommodate both children and adults, the
designer of the new models, Jason Hulst, had to wrestle with
proportions to get the right sense of scale. ``It's hard to make a
car look good when a child is in it,'' Gurr said. Just as
real-world car design is intended to convey a buyer's personality,
the Autopia cars are also less serious and more image-conscious.
</P>
<P>
   Although Disneyland is an icon of American culture, Detroit is
not about to mimic these designs, said Gaylord Eckles, an
industrial design instructor at the Art Center College of Design in
Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   And he had a suggestion of his own: ``If Disney can do
animatronic figures, why not have the cars really animated with
moving lips?''
</P>
<P>
   He did like the color-shifting paint of the sports car, a
special effect first used in 1996 on a limited-edition Ford Mustang
Cobra. &QL;

HOW BEST TO DEDUCT THE HIGH COST OF GASOLINE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 9) 
 By STACY KRAVETZ    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite recent signs of easing, high prices at the gas pump
continue to stir political debate. They may also change the
calculus for another, more personal question: Which method should
taxpayers use when figuring deductions for business mileage: The
standard rate or the actual-expense version?
</P>
<P>
   It is a decision that should be revisited whenever any of the
relevant elements change, experts say. For the self-employed, the
choice is especially important, though even employees who are
reimbursed for their mileage can deduct expenses in excess of the
reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   Business mileage refers to any driving done for work excluding a
commute to and from the office _ trips to see clients, to
courthouses or to meetings, for example.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the standard mileage rate, or the business expense
allowed by the Internal Revenue Service for each mile driven for
business, has generally ticked up steadily but slowly, mirroring
cost-of-living adjustments. The rate is a calculation of the
average driver's auto-related expenses, including lease payments,
depreciation, interest payments, insurance, gasoline, repairs and
maintenance costs. The rationale is that while gas prices and other
expenses may fluctuate, they have a relatively small impact on the
overall cost of driving.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean, however, that the standard mileage rate
reflects the cost of driving for any individual driver. People who
live in large cities, for example, spend more on insurance, while
those who finance expensive cars pay more interest. And as gasoline
prices climbed this year, Midwesterners paid higher prices than
others. But everyone who chooses this method of accounting gets the
same standard rate, though some small items, like parking and
tolls, can be added.
</P>
<P>
   When the IRS lowered the standard mileage rate last year, from
32.5 cents a mile to 31 cents as of April 1, it was a blow to those
who thought the rate was already too low. And with pump prices up
markedly since then, the actual-expense method bears extra
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We calculate it both ways for our clients and invariably 99
percent of the time the actual expense provides a better tax
deduction than the mileage rate they give you,'' said Howard
Leitner, a partner at the accounting firm Leitner, Zander,
Sniderman &AMP; Co. in Los Angeles. ``With rising gas prices, if you
were on the border of whether you should take actual or standard,
it will push you over to the actual-expense side.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the main benefit of using the standard rate is its
simplicity. A taxpayer need keep records only of the miles driven
for business in a given year.
</P>
<P>
   But when should savings trump ease? The only way to know the
difference between the standard rate and actual expenses is to run
the numbers. The calculation will include the number of business
miles driven in a year and the amount spent on gasoline and other
allowable costs for the portion of driving that relates to
business.
</P>
<P>
   The standard rate is based on average car expenses, with an
estimate for gasoline costs based on prices in the previous year _
currently, about $1.50 a gallon. This hardly does justice to prices
spiking upward of $2.50 a gallon, as they did recently in many
Midwestern cities. For a car that gets 20 miles to the gallon, a
$1-a-gallon jump in gas prices means an increase of 5 cents a mile.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could look at it as the IRS cheating you by 5 cents a
mile,'' said Gordon Klein, a tax lawyer and a lecturer at the
Anderson School at the University of California at Los Angeles.
``It could add up.''
</P>
<P>
   For people who barely use their cars for business or who have
extremely low car expenses, the extra effort of collecting receipts
and calculating expenses will generally not produce enough savings
to justify the work. Similarly, employees whose companies reimburse
their business mileage may not receive a big benefit, because they
can deduct only the actual expenses above the amount they are
reimbursed. Most employers pay for mileage at the IRS standard
rate. In addition, the IRS does not let employees claim the
interest portion of car payments as an auto expense, so their
allowable ``actual expenses'' will be lower than those for the
self-employed.
</P>
<P>
   Accountants say the differences in savings tend to be biggest
for people who are self-employed or who lease cars, or both.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're self-employed, it's a real issue because you're not
getting anything if you don't take it on your tax return,'' said
David Green, a partner in the personal financial services practice
at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Los Angeles. When they itemize, the
self-employed may claim the interest portion of their car payments
as an expense, along with all other annual costs of driving for
business.
</P>
<P>
   Say a self-employed woman has a $35,000 car that is used 50
percent of the time for business. She can deduct actual expenses
totaling 50 percent of her gasoline, insurance, interest and
maintenance expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The car was financed at an interest rate of 8.49 percent, is
driven a total of 12,000 miles in a year and gets 25 miles to the
gallon in a metropolitan area where gasoline costs $1.75 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   The business half of the expenses includes $750 for insurance,
$1,374 for interest, $420 for gasoline and $250 for maintenance.
The IRS also considers depreciation an expense, though it is capped
for all cars, no matter their cost, and is set at a different
amount for each subsequent year of use.
</P>
<P>
   For cars first used for business in 1999, the cap that year was
$3,060. (The cap for cars first used in 2000 has not yet been set.)
In the example, that means a maximum of $1,530 (or 50 percent of
$3,060) could be included as an expense. In this case, the driver
would be allowed $1,530 for depreciation, bringing her total
allowable expenses to $4,324.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the standard mileage rate of 31 cents a mile would
let her deduct only $1,860.
</P>
<P>
   The gap between the calculations, of course, grows as fuel
efficiency drops or as the price of gasoline jumps. Say the car in
the example was a gas-guzzler, getting 15 miles to the gallon in a
city where gas prices have risen to $2.50 a gallon. The vehicle's
annual fuel costs would jump to $1,000, from $420, and total
expenses would rise to $4,904, from $4,324. But the standard
mileage rate would still allow for just $1,860.
</P>
<P>
   Big differences are also seen in the computations for leased
cars. While there are no interest expenses or depreciation
involved, lease payments may be included in the actual-expense
calculation. So if that same gas-guzzler were leased, with annual
payments of $3,800, the total actual expenses would be $5,800.
</P>
<P>
   If doing the extra math makes sense, remember that choosing the
actual-expense method the first year a car is used for business
obligates you to continue with it as long as you have that car. (If
you choose the standard rate the first year, you may be able to
switch to actual expenses in later years.)
</P>
<P>
   True, itemizing expenses can be an ordeal. But the tax savings
gained through using the actual-expense method may, among other
things, be one small way to feel better about the pain at the pump.

<P>
   TULSA, Okla. _ American business is rushing into China, and
Marilyn C. Grant, a 56-year-old widow who drives a forklift for a
fishing reel company, is being left behind.
</P>
<P>
   The Zebco Corp., Grant's employer, began moving much of its
fishing reel production to China at the end of June, just a few
weeks after the House passed a measure that would end Cold War
restrictions on trade with China. Most of Zebco's 240 workers will
eventually lose their jobs, and Grant, who has worked at the
company's stone headquarters plant in Tulsa for 25 years, expects
to be one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this only happened to other people, and now it's
about to happen to me,'' Grant said. ``We're just another company
moving over there.''
</P>
<P>
   In promoting permanent normal trade relations with China, which
the House approved in late May and the Senate is expected to vote
on in late July, President Clinton predicted an ``almost
incalculable'' increase in exports of U.S. goods to China. But the
move also seems likely to encourage exports of some U.S. jobs.
</P>
<P>
   China agreed to open its markets in order to join the World
Trade Organization and to get permanent trading rights in the
United States. That should make it easier to sell American-made
products there. But as China modernizes and loosens controls, its
lure as a manufacturing base, which has been growing since the
early 1980s, is also proving irresistible to many multinationals.
For every jumbo jet that Boeing sells to China, it seems, a Zebco
sends a production line there, too.
</P>
<P>
   Trade is not a zero-sum ``you win, I lose'' game, and most
economists say that even if some people lose their jobs, the United
States reaps advantages from trade _ like greater productivity,
higher corporate profits and cheaper spincast reels. But if people
are celebrating these diffuse benefits, they are not partying as
much as Zebco's workers are seething.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our government just handed our jobs to a communist country,''
said Brenda McCoy, 50, a Zebco assembly-line veteran who wore a
T-shirt to work that bears an image of two Chinese police officers
choking a Chinese labor activist. ``It just makes you feel angry
and helpless.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese claim to have invented the modern fishing device
more than a millennium ago by spooling line onto wicker reels. But
it was the Zero Hour Bomb Co. of Tulsa that invented and patented
the spincast reel 50 years ago, with line spinning off the end of a
stationary spool and remaining, famously, backlash free.
</P>
<P>
   Now called Zebco, the company is a classic American success
story. Its nearly fool-proof reels helped make fishing perhaps the
nation's most popular leisure activity. They carry a ``Made in
America with Pride'' logo.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the last decade, as it had to fight competitors who paid
much lower hourly wages to workers in Asia, Zebco remained the
dominant fishing tackle brand. Though Zebco once tested production
in Mexico, it pulled back when its Tulsa workers proved they could
produce more reels in less time with fewer defects.
</P>
<P>
   The dike finally gave way this year, however. With most of
Zebco's competitors having already set up fishing tackle plants in
China, allowing them to undercut Zebco's prices at Wal-Marts
everywhere, Zebco began exploring a year ago the possibility of
moving its own lines to China. The company found that it could
commission Chinese factories to produce and deliver reels to the
United States for a third less than it could make them at home,
company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Zebco decided to make most of its low-end reels at factories in
China. For now, it will continue to produce more expensive reels in
Tulsa, though union officials say the company has put them on
notice that it is searching for further ways to lower labor costs,
including the possibility of shifting the remaining reels to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made valiant efforts to keep production in the United
States,'' said Kathryn J. Chieger, vice president for corporate and
investor relations at the Brunswick Corp., Zebco's parent company,
in Lake Forest, Ill. ``We just had a flood of product coming from
Asia at prices we could not meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the layoffs, which began June 27, left Zebco's
unionized workers, who are mostly women, perplexed and angry.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a dimly lit Transport Union Workers hall, the air
soured by cigarette smoke and the tables stacked with copies of
protest literature that workers distributed at a recent anti-China
trade demonstration, Kristie L. Cater said she had expected to
retire in the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept telling us we were members of the Zebco family,''
she said with angry sarcasm. ``I guess they just forgot about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As assembly-line factory jobs go, Zebco offers ordinary pay but
solid benefits, including Christmas gifts of stock certificates.
Workers returned the loyalty. Turnover was low. Some workers also
became avid anglers, showing off Zebco's reels at bass and crappie
fishing tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   For Linda Allen, 41, an assembly-line supervisor since 1976,
work was literally a family affair: Her mother and grandmother
preceded her in the job.
</P>
<P>
   Those ties started to unravel last year. When company executives
visited Qingdao, a city in northeastern China, to inspect
factories, word leaked out. Then, this year, the company pushed
assembly-line workers to raise their output by at least 10 percent
a month, and China became a cattle prod.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we don't get quota, it is another day closer to China
taking our jobs,'' read a Feb. 3 memorandum from the company that
was circulated among employees. ``So today China won by 45
points.''
</P>
<P>
   Chieger, of Zebco, said such memos were intended to show workers
what they were ``up against'' in terms of competitors that had
factories in China.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the shop floor fell into stunned silence one March
afternoon when the president of the company read a brief statement
as first-shift workers finished their day. Zebco was moving some
production to China. Many of those listening would lose their jobs.
Zebco reels no longer commanded an ``adequate profit,'' the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The explanation offended Grant, the widow who drives a Zebco
forklift.
</P>
<P>
   Grant has gray hair and delicate manners. As she speaks, her
eyes dart about the living room of her A-frame house, which is
decorated with porcelain figurines and homemade quilts. Only her
strong shoulders reveal the heavy lifting she does each day as a
Zebco receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have never said they don't make a profit,'' she said.
``It's that word `adequate.' They're going over to China because of
greed.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years from retirement, she said she had begun looking
for a new job. Tulsa's economy is relatively strong, and she found
one prospect. But if she got the job _ she worries that a touch of
arthritis might hurt her chances _ she would lose her
quarter-century seniority and $1.50 of her $10.63 hourly wage, she
said, money she needs to make payments on her secondhand Jeep.
</P>
<P>
   Cater, 37, a mother of two, said that after she learned of her
layoff on the assembly line, she told her 17-year-old daughter to
check out community colleges in Tulsa; the higher priced Colorado
school she had been considering was now out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some savings put away, but that's going to disappear,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   At least in theory, the recent steps China has taken to open its
markets should be good for U.S. factory workers and farmers by
making it easier for companies to export goods to that nation.
</P>
<P>
   But as union leaders argued when they tried unsuccessfully to
block the China trade bill in the House, many leading U.S.
companies are like Zebco: They often want to save money by
producing in China _ often exporting back to the United States _
rather than making goods here to sell in China.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been losing manufacturing jobs for
decades, of course, and dire warnings about the hollowing out of
the economy seem a little hyperbolic during the longest expansion
in the nation's history. Most economists believe that the trade
boom of the last decade _ more exports, cheaper imports and the
reallocation of jobs to more productive parts of the economy _
forms a central pillar of the 1990s expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, although the Clinton administration often touted
exports as the headline benefit of broadening trade with China, the
real advantage for U.S. companies is probably enhanced rights of
investment and ownership there. Phone, Internet, bank and insurance
companies can buy larger stakes in Chinese counterparts and set up
operations in more cities under the terms of China's entry to the
World Trade Organization. Most companies try to crack the difficult
China market by setting up local operations, often using those
plants as export production bases as well.
</P>
<P>
   That means that the push into China is not limited to low-wage
assemblers. Cisco, Intel, Eastman Kodak and Motorola are among the
multinational companies that have lobbied Congress to grant China
permanent normal trade relations even as they have expanded their
manufacturing operations in China, according to a survey by the
U.S. Business and Industry Council, which has been critical of
Clinton administration trade policies.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, exports to China will probably grow. But the volume of
imports is expected to grow even faster. The U.S. International
Trade Commission, a government agency, predicts that American
exports will increase 10 percent a year if China opens its markets
as promised. But it also sees China's appeal as a manufacturing
base rising fast, bolstering China's exports to the United States
by 7 percent annually. Since imports from China already exceed
exports to China by a wide margin, the gaping $62 billion trade
deficit is likely to widen rather than contract.
</P>
<P>
   The way many workers see it, America loses.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the United States was better off with cheaper
fishing reels or job security for Zebco workers, Grant reflected
for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``People might like buying things cheaper,'' she said. ``But
there's a price. They're going to wake up one day and find that
nothing's made here.''

RAYTHEON HOPES RIDE ANTI-MISSILE TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an anti-missile test Friday night, the Pentagon and its
contractors will try to knock down an incoming dummy warhead _ and
perhaps a few of their critics.
</P>
<P>
   The trial will be the third in a series of shoot-down tests for
the National Missile Defense program, which has posted a mixed
record in previous tryouts and generated much doubt among academics
and foreign-policy experts.
</P>
<P>
   If fully deployed, the program could be worth about $8 billion
to Raytheon Co. But even one Raytheon board member thinks the
system isn't ready for prime time.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in the current issue of Foreign Policy, former CIA
director John Deutch, a Raytheon director, and two co-authors state
that no matter what the outcome of the test, the anti-missile
technology is ``not mature enough for the United States to make a
confident deployment decision this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Adminstration has said it will do just that,
however, promising to signal when to begin full-scale construction
of the system. By current estimates, the effort could cost as much
as $60 billion by 2015, creating a network of up to 250
interceptors to counter threats from rogue nations like North
Korea. That country could have missiles of its own by 2005, the
soonest a basic missile defense system could be ready, the Pentagon
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Some doubt Clinton will commit to a firm construction schedule
before leaving office. One concern of critics is whether deployment
would violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Republican
George W. Bush has called for scrapping the treaty and building an
extensive missile defense, while administration officials and Vice
President Al Gore hope Russia will negotiate amendments to permit a
limited program.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch and others say the military should pursue an alternative
weapons strategy to shoot down enemy missiles just after they are
launched rather than on their way to a target.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pentagon says its existing strategy is the most
practical, and the latest test launch will show how well its
interceptor rockets will work with new radar systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we have the technology? That remains to be determined,''
Secretary of Defense William Cohen said this week. ``That's one of
the reasons we have to await the outcome of the next test.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial is scheduled to begin between 10 p.m. Friday and 2
a.m. Saturday. Plans call for the target, a Minuteman II
intercontintental ballastic missile, to be launched from Vandenberg
Air Force Base, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes later an interceptor missile carrying a
Raytheon-built ``kill vehicle'' will be launched from Kwajalein
Atoll in the central Pacific Ocean. Ten minutes after that, the
kill vehicle is meant to locate the incoming dummy warhead, then
ram it at a combined speed of 12,000 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is daunting. In a test in January the kill vehicle
missed its target because of problems with infra-red guidance
sensors. The vehicle hit its mark in an earlier test last October,
but only after overcoming software-programming errors.
</P>
<P>
   Last month a panel chaired by retired Air Force general Larry
Welch called the chances of developing and fielding a limited
system by 2005 a ``high risk.'' The panel found no reason to adjust
the decision-schedule, however, but others disagree. Last month, US
Sen. John F. Kerry urged Clinton to delay the deployment decision
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have grave concerns that we are sacrificing careful
technical development of this system in order to meet an artificial
deadline,'' Kerry said in a speech.
</P>
<P>
   One area of dispute has been whether the system is able to
distinguish real warheads from decoys that enemy missiles might
also release.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Postol, professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, contends the Pentagon has rigged its tests to ensure
the kill vehicles ignore decoys. Pentagon officials say Postol's
claims are based on data from old tests, but they won't discuss its
new procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon works on the missile-defense program under contract to
Boeing Co. Raytheon's work includes the kill vehicle, software
upgrades to some existing radar stations, and a short-wavelength
radar system meant to pick out fine details of enemy warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials say it's too soon to provide estimates for how
any new work would affect its profits or revenue. Government and
industry sources cite some public figures for guidance: fully
deployed, the missile defense program could include 250 kill
vehicles, at about $15 million apiece; six radar upgrades at
perhaps $100 million apiece; and, nine X-band radars, at around
$450 million each.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon produces the kill vehicles in Arizona, while most of
Raytheon's radar work would occur at its plants near Andover, Mass.
One of the radar facilites to be upgraded would be at the Cape Cod
Air Force Station, in Sagamore, Mass. Raytheon's headquarters is in
Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the views of Deutch, its board member, Raytheon says
everything is on track. ``Our job is to prove that the technology
is available to support a positive deployment decision this year,''
said company spokesman Dave Shea.

TEXAS PHONE COMPANY TO BEGIN LONG-DISTANCE SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SBC Communications plans to announce Friday the long-distance
rates it will charge in Texas, the second state, after New York, in
which a local phone company will also offer long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   Starting on Monday, SBC will offer long-distance plans to
individual and corporate customers that will compete with service
offered by companies like WorldCom, AT&AMP;T and Sprint. Verizon
Communications, the former Bell Atlantic, entered the long-distance
market in New York at the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative in Texas is part of a trend to allow consumers to
buy long-distance service from the regional Bell companies created
by the breakup of AT&AMP;T in the 1980s. Under the Telecommunications
Act of 1996, the Bells were allowed to seek regulatory approval for
long-distance service state by state. SBC received approval last
week from the Federal Communications Commission for service in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're encouraged to see greater competition with the likes of
SBC moving into long distance,'' said Susan Grant, vice president
for public policy at the National Consumers League in Washington.
``But this type of thing can be a blessing or a curse, because so
many choices can be bewildering.''
</P>
<P>
   SBC, based in San Antonio, said it will announce a basic rate of
9 cents a minute for in-state and out-of-state calls anytime, with
no monthly fee. For customers who choose services like call waiting
or caller ID, SBC will offer a flat rate of 6 cents a minute.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, SBC will take advantage of the demographics of
Texas, a state with a large Hispanic population, and cater some
services to people who make frequent calls to Mexico. For instance,
under one plan, calls to border towns in Mexico will cost 13 cents
a minute, while calls to Mexico City will cost 34 cents a minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our understanding from talking with our customers is that
clarity, savings and one-stop shopping are very strong incentives
to choose our plans,'' said David Cole, president for consumer
markets at the Southwestern Bell unit of SBC.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said customers choosing one of SBC's basic plans could
save money because the average per-minute long-distance charge in
Texas is more than 20 cents a minute. Nationwide, long-distance
rates are about 20 cents a minute, according to the Gartner Group,
a telecommunications research firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an innovative step, something we all expected and
hoped for with the Bells entering the long-distance arena,'' said
Jeffrey Kagan, an independent telecommunications industry analyst.
``It is much more exciting than Bell Atlantic's timid,
plain-vanilla-envelope entry into long distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bell Atlantic did not offer any flat-rate plans when it
introduced long-distance service in New York, the company is
estimated to have signed up nearly a million long-distance
customers, which translates into about $250 million a year in
revenue.

 &HT;    BellSouth continues to wait for answers
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - The high-stakes alliance that will meld the wireless
units of BellSouth and SBC Communications to take on national
players is still waiting for answers to some important questions.
</P>
<P>
   First and most important: Will BellSouth decide to renew its bid
to purchase Sprint?
</P>
<P>
   If it does, BellSouth would expect that a purchase would mean
ditching either Sprint's national wireless business or BellSouth's
own wireless unit, which has amassed about 6 million subscribers,
nearly all in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Indications are that if Deutsche Telekom makes an offer for
Sprint, BellSouth likely will not.
</P>
<P>
   That would leave BellSouth to pursue other potential targets
like Qwest Communications, which has no national wireless presence.
And certainly BellSouth officials are preparing for the launch of
the joint venture with SBC as if that is the basket into which they
will throw all their domestic wireless eggs.
</P>
<P>
   So if BellSouth is going to follow through, it must fill in some
blanks.
</P>
<P>
   No chief executive has been named for the wireless unit. No
headquarters city has been named. And in fact, no name has been
given to the venture itself. And while the companies talked of
launching service later this year, no date is going to be set until
those other questions are answered.
</P>
<P>
   But some kind of answer should come soon if the new venture is
to have a shot at the lucrative late-year holiday consumer market.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, announced in April, silenced critics of BellSouth who
had wondered how the company could survive with just a regional
wireless offering. But with the SBC arrangement, BellSouth will go
from an offering nearly limited to its nine-state region to one
that is nearly national: The joint venture will create a wireless
unit with revenues of $10.2 billion and 16.2 million phone
subscribers in 32 states.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the companies plan to add to that, perhaps by buying
licenses, perhaps through alliances.
</P>
<P>
   But no question, the still-unnamed venture will start with
enough bulk to be taken seriously. BellSouth and SBC together will
form the second-largest carrier behind only Verizon, a joint
venture of Bell Atlantic, GTE and Vodafone AirTouch that boasts 24
million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   SBC and its Chief Executive Edward Whitacre Jr. have an industry
reputation for being voracious in seeking markets and for playing
hardball in deals and alliances. But BellSouth's CEO, Duane
Ackerman, is friendly with Whitacre and BellSouth believes it has
forged a deal in which it will not be out-muscled.
</P>
<P>
   SBC and BellSouth will share control, although as the bigger
partner, SBC will own the majority of the venture. The two
companies have agreed to split representation on the board and
among top executives, with the top exec coming from neither SBC or
BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   But since that announcement, officials have been mum.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most high-profile possible candidates for the top job
at the new company is Andrew Sukawaty, who resigned recently as
chief executive of Sprint's wireless unit. As for locations, the
initial agreement had called for picking a headquarters that was
outside the turf of both SBC and BellSouth. The theory on a chief
executive has followed that same template: Find someone who is from
neither company.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all that is moot if BellSouth sells its wireless unit
to SBC and strolls away from the joint venture.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth had made a run at Sprint in October. After being
outbid by WorldCom, BellSouth went seeking other ways to improve
its position, and has since announced plans to deliver television
via satellite, to launch a tracking stock for its Latin American
investments and to forge the joint venture with SBC.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, the Justice Department moved to block the merger
of the Sprint-WorldCom merger. The companies _ especially WorldCom
_ struggled to resuscitate their agreement, but now appear ready to
announce the deal's demise.
</P>
<P>
   Then, both will be free to entertain other offers.
</P>
<P>
   And both are expected to seek partners. Deutsche Telekom seems
most interested in Sprint as a giant prize moving it closer to its
plan goal of becoming a global provider. WorldCom conceivably could
also be game _ but only for a huge hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Most probably, WorldCom must decide whether to jettison its
consumer offerings and focus on businesses.
</P>
<P>
   If WorldCom does still want wireless, WorldCom must choose
between very expensive targets with national presence like Nextel
or VoiceStream and those with more limited scope like Powertel or
Alltel.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ There is a go-for-broke quality to the Israeli and
American approach to the coming Camp David summit meeting, which
starts Tuesday with the stated goal of ending a 52-year-old,
blood-steeped conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Palestinians, whose participation is more reluctant,
there is at best an aspiration that the three-way meeting will
serve as a stopgap to keep alive the stalemated peace effort so
that a partial deal can be achieved by September.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak will arrive in Maryland as a weakened
Israeli leader with one thing on his mind: to push the peace effort
with the Palestinians to a conclusion before he loses his grip on
power. Battered by the right over his peace moves and by the left
over his concessions to the religious parties, he will try to rise
above the partisan politics that, with two parties poised to quit
his coalition, is about to cost him his parliamentary majority.
</P>
<P>
   Barak will seek to forge the framework of a final peace deal
with the Palestinians on the basis of what he considers a directive
from the Israeli people, who, as he often notes, overwhelming
elected him last year on a platform of peacemaking. And if he
fails, he said Thursday, he will have given it his best effort in
the face of a keen potential for the conflict to disintegrate
``into Belfast or Bosnia.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, President Clinton appears to have decided that he
cannot make things worse by forcing the parties into an endgame,
since no summit meeting and a failed summit meeting have the same
potential outcome: violence. If the chemistry of the moment
produces a breakthrough in the peace effort, the accomplishment is
a substantial one. If not, the risk to the American president is
minimal; he, too, will have given it his best shot.
</P>
<P>
   But the Palestinians' leader, Yasser Arafat, whose lifelong
struggle rests on this effort, will approach Camp David far more
skeptically and cautiously than the other two leaders. He will take
part against the counsel of his senior advisers, who think the
groundwork has not been laid for a compromise on any major issue.
</P>
<P>
   Of mixed mind, Arafat is saying that he is going to Maryland
only because he cannot refuse an invitation from Clinton. But he is
also betting that if peace negotiations are to work, he stands to
gain the most at a high-stakes summit meeting presided over by this
American president, with whom he has forged a bond. At any rate,
weighing the alternative _ a unilateral declaration of statehood,
which is bound to be accompanied by renewed violence, an Israeli
annexation of West Bank land and complications for Arafat's
international acceptance _ he is willing to gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Like Anwar el-Sadat, before the last Middle East peace gathering
at Camp David, in 1978, Arafat needs to deliver some kind of
victory to his weary people, many of whom, for all their talk of
sacrifice, would prefer not to spill much more blood.
</P>
<P>
   Having proclaimed and disclaimed previous deadlines for
establishing a state, Arafat and the Palestinian leadership this
week tied the Palestinian fate to a new one, Sept. 13. This one
will be harder to ignore if he is to retain his credibility; it
marks the formal end of the interim peacemaking period, which was
extended from May 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But the chief economic adviser to Arafat, Mohammed Rachid, who
will accompany him to Maryland, said Thursday night that the
Palestinians would willingly bypass the deadline if they were
engaged in serious negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   And many experts think the Palestinian people, who would prefer
a real state to a nominal one, could be persuaded to endure yet
another postponement if they saw any tangible progress _ like a
substantial transfer of West Bank land.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people are pragmatic and they'll accept a bird in the
hand,'' said Ghassan Khatib, a Palestinian political analyst who
has done extensive polling on attitudes toward peace. ``There is a
growing minority that rejects the peace process, but it is not a
majority, and there is no alternative. There is no other game. The
peace process is becoming a way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   A cartoon in the Palestinian newspaper Al Quds Thursday showed
the spirit of the meeting as a whirlwind blowing out the candle of
the Palestinian declaration of independence.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli military analysts paint a different picture. In a
briefing for foreign reporters Thursday, a senior military officer
in the West Bank said Arafat had introduced a ``struggle
consciousness'' to accompany the negotiations. He said Arafat
wanted to achieve independence ``through friction and blood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules of the game are low-intensity conflict accompanying
the diplomatic process with the threat of terrorism in the
background,'' the senior officer said. ``Arafat wants to appear as
both the pyromaniac and the fireman.''
</P>
<P>
   One could be whipsawed by the surface contradictions here
Thursday between the bounding optimism of Israeli doves and the
thick skepticism of Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving a meeting with Arafat in Gaza City Thursday, Yossi
Beilin, Israel's justice minister, expressed unconditional faith in
the eventuality of a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that all the leaders will go to Camp David and
come back empty-handed,'' he said. ``We are going to make peace.
And after all these years, we will have to compromise, both sides,
to find solutions and come back home and tell our kids that they
will not have to take part in the wars we took part in.''

</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Abu Ala, speaker of the Palestinian legislature and
a senior negotiator, said he did not think the summit meeting would
achieve any of its aims. ``It is clear that Barak is trying to
escape from negotiations and jump to a summit because he thinks he
can force deals,'' he said. ``But if he thinks that he can give us
some land on which to declare a Palestinian state and then we will
forget the other issues, then he's living in a dream world.''
</P>
<P>
   Rachid, a relatively unideological and pragmatic adviser, spoke
more practically about what could be achieved. He said that, in
Israeli style and on an Israeli scale, the Palestinians would ask
the Americans for $40 billion in aid to accompany a peace treaty.
Most of that would go toward refugee aid, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also that the Israelis were overly focused on the percentage
of the West Bank they would transfer to the Palestinians. He noted
that Barak, who started out talking about turning over 50 percent
of the land, had increased his offer most recently to 88 percent _
78 percent now and 10 percent over time. But Rachid said the
Palestinians wanted the Israelis to stop thinking of it as their
land to give away and to start accepting the principle that the
Palestinians have a rightful claim to the West Bank. That, he
suggested, would make the Palestinians more flexible.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is unlikely to travel to Washington with his most
hard-line ministers because they are expected to quit before he
leaves. Interior Minister Natan Sharansky, who leads a small
Russian immigrant party, has said he will tender his resignation on
Sunday, and Housing Minister Yitzhak Levy, who leads the National
Religious Party, is prepared to step down too. Eli Yishai, leader
of the rigorously Orthodox Shas Party, is undecided about whether
he will travel with the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is expected to be accompanied by Foreign Minister David
Levy, Internal Security Minister Shlomo Ben Ami and Attorney
General Elyakim Rubenstein and his security advisers _ Danny Yatom,
Haim Mendel-Shaked and Zvi Stauber. Yossi Sarid, who heads the
leftist Meretz Party, and Transportation Minister Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak may join them, too.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's delegation will include Abu Ala; Rachid; the senior
negotiators Abu Mazen and Saeb Erekat; Mohammed Dahlan, a security
chief; and others.

US TO ORDER 15 PERCENT CUT IN CRANBERRY MARKETING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The federal government plans to make cranberry growers cut the
amount of fruit they bring to market by roughly 15 percent below
historical levels, hoping to aid an industry reeling from
overproduction and sluggish demand.
</P>
<P>
   Urged on by Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc. of Lakeville, Mass. and
other big cranberry players, the US Department of Agriculture
issued a so-called marketing order to avert ``a potential for a
number of producers to go out of business,'' said USDA deputy
undersecretary Enrique Figueroa.
</P>
<P>
   Cranberries are Massachusetts' largest crop, with 1.8 million
barrels harvested each year. Some 14,000 acres of farmland are in
cranberry production, according to the state Department of Food and
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, reducing supply could mean that consumers will pay
higher prices, but the USDA said the impact of its marketing order
on consumers should be modest.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ocean Spray, which accounts for about 70 percent of
cranberry production, said it plans to lower some prices as it
looks to reduce its surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The marketing order _ the first such order for cranberries in
nearly 30 years _ is set to go into effect next week, but that may
be too late for some growers to take steps to cut expenses on this
year's growing season.
</P>
<P>
   From the standpoint of planning a crop, ``April 1 would have
been the ideal date'' for a marketing order to have been issued,
said David Farrimond, executive director of the Cranberry Marketing
Committee, a part of the USDA.
</P>
<P>
   If an order had been issued in the spring, growers might have
been able to flood some of their bogs; when bogs are flooded early
in the season, they don't need to be pollinated, fertilized, and
treated with pesticides _ activities that incur expenses to
growers.
</P>
<P>
   Flooding bogs also can prevent cranberries from rotting on the
vine, something that can hurt future production.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday A.D. Makepeace Co. of Wareham, Mass., one of the
state's largest growers, indicated that it plans to flood some of
its bogs almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Why did the USDA issue a marketing order so late in the growing
season? According to some observers, the USDA doesn't take such
dramatic steps unless there is an industry consensus. For many
months, there was much debate over whether a marketing order was
needed and how large it should be.
</P>
<P>
   Despite less than ideal timing, some in the industry believe
that a marketing order is better late than never.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Spray, for one, hailed the marketing order as an important
early step on the road to the industry's recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a huge help in fixing the supply side of the
problem,'' said Ocean Spray spokesman Chris Phillips. ``But it's up
to Ocean Spray to innovate and address the demand side of the
problem. (A marketing order) is far from the whole solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Don LeClair, a Norwell, Mass. grower, described the marketing
order as necessary short-term pain. Some sacrifices must be made
now to increase the chances of long-term survival, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was thinking of survival five years ago. In the
mid-1990s, the industry boomed. When a 100-pound barrel of
cranberries could fetch $60 and up, many growers scrambled to
increase acreage so they could take advantage of high prices.
</P>
<P>
   From 1990 to 1999, the amount of North American acreage set
aside for growing cranberries rose by nearly 50 percent, according
to Ocean Spray.
</P>
<P>
   Because of increasing suburban development in the prime
cranberry growing areas of Massachusetts, local growers had little
room to expand. But growers in Wisconsin and Canada had wide open
spaces, and their acreage and production soared.
</P>
<P>
   Then the industry was hit by a double whammy. As growers
harvested bumper crops, demand softened. As a result of supply
exceeding demand, prices dropped to about $20 a barrel, and prices
could fall even further following the fall harvest.
</P>
<P>
   LeClair, the Norwell grower, said he needs to make $31 a barrel
for his cranberry operations to break even.

 &HT;    Armstrong drops to 12th place
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOURS, France _ The initial escape from the pack for stage six
of the Tour de France started only nine miles into the 123-mile
race Thursday from the medieval town of Vitre to the more
metropolitan Tours.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Jacky Durand, who adores the thought of television
cameras following his every move, decided it wasn't too early to
make a break from the rest of the pack. Besides, Durand was on
familiar roads _ his hometown of Mayenne is near the route.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven other renegades quickly got in line behind Durand, a
bandana-wearing Frenchman. By day's end, nine of the initial 12
found themselves occupying spots in the overall top 10.
</P>
<P>
   Laurent Jalabert, who wore the yellow jersey for the past two
days, dropped to 10th. And America's Lance Armstrong, the defending
Tour de France champion, tumbled to 12th.
</P>
<P>
   The new leader is Telekom's Alberto Elli. The 36-year-old
Italian, the oldest rider in the Tour, was so thrilled with wearing
his first-ever ``les maillots jaunes'' that he lifted the collar of
his new yellow jersey to his face and kissed it.
</P>
<P>
   Elli is the third rider to wear the yellow jersey in six days.
That's one more leader than last year's race, when Jaan Kirisipuu
and Armstrong were the only two to sport yellow in the 21 stages.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of Thursday's stage was Rabobank's Leon Van Bon, who
picked up his second career Tour win. Markus Zberg, Van Bon's
teammate, was second. Eleven of the initial pack of 12, including
Elli, earned the same winning time of 4 hours, 28.06 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's odd Tour showing was a result of Team Once's lack of
defense for Jalabert's yellow jersey. No one from Once chased down
the breakaway riders in order to tire them enough to pull them back
to the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we preserved our chances of the overall
classification,'' Jalabert said.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the first week of the Tour has little bearing on
the eventual standings. The main contenders for the championship
are the riders who survive the first week of flat courses and
strive to distance themselves from the rest of the pack when the
race hits the difficult mountain stages in the Pyrenees and Alps.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the outcome of Thursday's stage was a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attack was something we weren't planning for,'' Armstrong
said. ``Maybe it'll change the race a little. But I think the
favorites stay the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Elli, who started the day in 21st place, 2:11 out of first,
ended the stage with a 12-second overall lead over Fabrice Gougot.
Marc Wauters, another sprinter, was third, 1:17 out of first place.
</P>
<P>
   Jalabert was 5:40 behind Elli; Armstrong was 5:54. Both Jalabert
and Armstrong received the same time of 4 hours, 35.55 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Elli is a veteran of 11 Tours. However, his team strategy of
defending the jersey will be a unique one. Telekom's lead rider is
Jan Ullrich, who as the 1997 Tour winner figured to be Armstrong's
chief challenger this year. It's unlikely Ullrich will expend an
undue amount of energy helping Elli defend the jersey Ullrich
wants. The German rider also finished second in 1996 and 1998 but
did not ride last year because of a knee injury. He was 22nd after
Thursday, 6:37 behind Elli.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective is going to be to defend the jersey,'' Elli
said. ``And then in the mountains, I will try to pass it on to
Ullrich, who is more capable of keeping it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Livingston, a U.S. Postal Service teammate of Armstrong's,
said no one on his squad was that concerned about Thursday's change
in the leader board.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of us, we're OK,'' said Livingston, who is 24th
overall, 6:58 out of first. ``The makeup of the break was such
that, well they're great riders, but they're not really in
contention for the overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mountains will flip-flop everything. Maybe Telekom will
defend Elli one day, but their main objective is Ullrich.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin resident Chann McRae, who rides for Mapei, is 58th
overall.

   GARRISON, N.Y. _ In the theater it isn't always an encouraging
sign when the audience leaves humming the scenery. But at the
Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival, it's all but inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   The festival, one of the best-kept theatrical secrets of summer
in the gentrified outer reaches of the New York metropolitan area,
is ensconced in the most lyrical of settings for open-air theater:
the grounds of the Boscobel Restoration, a historic house and
gardens on a promontory overlooking the Hudson River across from
West Point. The plays change each July and August, but the
magnificent backdrop is immutable. At sunset on performance nights,
the spectators take their seats in a yellow open-sided tent and
watch as the actors materialize in the distance, rising from behind
a bluff over the riverbank and making their way to the stage by way
of a manicured lawn bathed in a shimmering, late-day amber.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's an entrance.
</P>
<P>
   The festival's co-founder and longtime artistic director,
Terrence O'Brien, knows from long experience not to try to compete
too grandly with the landscape: the company's program notes the
contributions of designers of lighting, sound, costumes and
choreography. Notably missing: any mention of a set designer.
Nature got the job long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come here on some days and I think, `This is my office,'''
Stephen Paul Johnson says as he sits under an ancient shade tree on
the vast Boscobel lawn, taking a break from rehearsing ``Measure
for Measure,'' the festival's current offering, in which Johnson
plays Angelo, the lecherous villain. ``Our curtain goes up as the
sunlight starts to fade.''
</P>
<P>
   Theatrical fads inevitably fade, too, but Shakespeare alfresco,
it appears, is forever. From Lenox, Mass., where Shakespeare and
Company is in residence, to Central Park, where free Shakespeare is
such an entrenched institution that theatergoing New Yorkers seem
to claim tickets as a birthright, the summer months ring with the
sounds of 400-year-old soliloquies and sway to the rhythms of
iambic pentameter.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say classical theater in the great outdoors
doesn't have some obvious drawbacks; when nature doesn't cooperate,
the tortures can descend in an un-air-conditioned environment as
potently as the 12 plagues. ``Heat and bugs,'' O'Brien says,
enumerating two of the festival's most intrepid enemies. On
especially sultry nights, a lightheaded ticketbuyer or two have
been known to lose consciousness momentarily, and the squadrons of
mosquitoes will brazenly divebomb their targets through the most
heartbreaking moments in all of Shakespeare. The festival, in
response, has developed its own arsenal, a table laid with insect
sprays and lotions, and a new ventilation system that it says can
suck the hot air out of the tent every five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It does take a certain kind of resourcefulness to create art
under these circumstances, and the festival, now in its 14th
season, is used to squeezing every bit of advantage out of its
glorious surroundings. No one, of course, is getting rich doing
Elizabethan drama in a tent in Putnam County; the festival operates
on a relative shoestring. The budget for putting on two full-scale
productions, paying actors Equity scale, housing them at a local
college, renting the tent, leasing the grounds, printing the
programs and making the costumes is just under $600,000. The troupe
has almost no money for promotion, so it does not take out many
advertisements in the local papers, let alone film any of those
television commercials with the sappy post-show testimonials.
</P>
<P>
   OUT ON A LIMB
</P>
<P>
   What it does have is powerful word of mouth, helped along by
O'Brien's accessible and intelligent productions, many of which
have received favorable notices, including one this week by Ben
Brantley in The New York Times for the current production.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer's ``Titus Andronicus,'' for example, was a daring
and controversial choice. The festival had built up an audience
over the years with safer fare like ``A Midsummer Night's Dream''
and ``As You Like It,'' but the director found in ``Titus'' an
intriguing parallel between its blood-soaked plot and the mechanics
of action-adventure movies. The violent denouement was played in
slow motion, a splatter scene in which the actors clutched spurting
bladders filled with a mixture of red food dye, chocolate syrup and
laundry detergent. Shakespeare, in other words, as a kind of hokier
version of ``Gladiator.''
</P>
<P>
   The festival is greatly aided, too, by those breathtaking vistas
of the Hudson, which put a visitor in mind of a hazy day on the
Rhine. There are, in fact, few pre-theater dinners more beguiling
than a picnic on the Boscobel grass, with a view clear down to the
Bear Mountain Bridge. (You can take your own meal or buy one of the
festival's, prepared in the kitchens of a nearby golf club.) The
combination has made it an ever more popular destination: last
year, a record 14,700 playgoers attended the festival's 45
performances of ``Twelfth Night'' and ``Titus.'' This season,
O'Brien and the festival's executive director, Susan Landstreet,
are hoping to do even better with 50 performances of ``Measure for
Measure'' and ``The Taming of the Shrew.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are no ``Lion King''-size paydays here. Even with
the record turnout, the festival finished last summer with exactly
zero dollars in the till. ``We took a bit of a bath,'' Landstreet
says, explaining that reviews for ``Titus'' were not published
until late in its run, so attendance at the early performances of
one of Shakespeare's obscurer plays was disappointing. The
festival's board came to the rescue with enough money to keep the
troupe afloat. But the experience pointed up how precarious staging
the classics becomes when a company of some ambition opts for
something other than the tried and true. Those bucolic country
roads can quickly become filled with potholes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   AN UNORTHODOX CHOICE
</P>
<P>
   It is a humid Saturday afternoon in late June at Boscobel, a
crucial day in the life of the Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival.
In a few hours, ``Measure for Measure'' is to open, and like
``Titus'' the summer before, it is an unorthodox choice. (In
contrast, ``Shrew,'' the season's second offering, is ``selling
like hot cakes,'' Landstreet says.) The play tells the improbable
story of a man sentenced to death for fornication; his sister, a
novice in an abbey, pursued by a venomous lawman; and a noble duke
roaming his corrupted city in disguise. It veers wildly between
comedy and tragedy and has a thoroughly unconvincing happy ending
tacked on.
</P>
<P>
   Under the tent, O'Brien has Johnson, a festival veteran, and
Aidan Sullivan, a recent Juilliard graduate, in the key role of
Isabella, the novice, going over one of the play's most difficult
scenes, in which Angelo makes his sexual desire known to Isabella.
``That felt mechanical,'' Johnson says after hesitantly caressing
Sullivan. O'Brien, a lug of a guy in Bermuda shorts and sandals,
whispers something to the actors, and they try the scene again.
This time, Sullivan registers more revulsion, and the director
seems satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, who lives in Manhattan with his wife and two young
children, has been having at Shakespeare every summer since 1987,
when an actress friend, Melissa Stern Lourie, invited him to Putnam
to stage a benefit outdoor performance of ``A Midsummer Night's
Dream.'' It proved so popular that O'Brien and Stern _ who has
since left the troupe _ decided to found the festival, with the
help of a group of local supporters who formed a board. In its
second season the festival moved to Boscobel, an 18th-century
estate restored by a private foundation in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   MOONLIGHTING
</P>
<P>
   ``I sort of feel like my job is as a divining rod, just to sit
there and see if what's going on is true or not,'' said O'Brien,
who is, in a sense, moonlighting in the countryside. His day job is
creating customized software, which seems about as far removed from
the forests of Arden, the courts of Vienna and the midsummer
fairies as one can get. ``Most of my clients think it's exciting,''
he said. ``But my cell phone does go off during rehearsals, and
it's `Hi, we ran out of disk space in the notes server.'''
</P>
<P>
   When you are a serious theater person, and you get to direct one
show a year (the ``Shrew,'' now in rehearsals, is being directed by
his colleague Nick Mangano), the emotional stakes can be pretty
high. O'Brien says he begins thinking about his production months
before the first actor is cast, and usually the initial ideas for
his interpretation come from music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I end up being very intuitive about these choices,'' he says.
``Suddenly a song will come to my mind, and I'll make a connection
between the lyric of the song and the play.'' For `Measure,' the
inspiration was, of all things, `Santa Baby,' a kitschy Eartha Kitt
song from the '50s. O'Brien's quirky linkage is incorporated into
the production in a highly visible way. The number, lip-synched by
Sullivan to Kitt's recording and accompanied by a vamping chorus of
actors, provides a stylish opening to the second act.
</P>
<P>
   ``The song is like a comic extreme of what's happening in the
play,'' O'Brien says, adding, ``I end up justifying the choice
intellectually, even though the choice was intuitive to begin
with.''
</P>
<P>
   `WEIRD LITTLE SETUP'
</P>
<P>
   If the tent is a fairly spartan affair _ 400 folding chairs on
risers arranged in a wide semicircle _ so are the actors' living
conditions. This year, the company consists of 11 Equity players,
who make $415 a week, and are put up in the dorms of Mount St. Mary
College in Newburgh, which charges the festival $9 an actor a
night, Landstreet said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave Kurt and me a double bed,'' Nance Williamson said
with a laugh, referring to her husband, Kurt Rhoads. They are what
you might call the festival's answer to the Lunts, having appeared
together as Beatrice and Benedick in ``Much Ado About Nothing'''
and, this summer, as Kate and Petruchio in ``Shrew.'' They have
attracted a following among Hudson Valley's audiences, which come
chiefly from Westchester, Putnam and Dutchess counties, though the
festival is looking for ways to increase its draw from Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The Lunts live in the dorm like everyone else. ``When you first
hear about it, it's like, `Oh, no, there's a tent and bare grass
and a mud floor?'' said Rhoads, who is playing the duke in
``Measure'' and is in his sixth festival season here. ``The
ingredients are not for a very professional experience. But you
know, this environment, this weird little setup, is a great way to
tell a story.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien uses the vast Boscobel space in inspired ways to tell
the stories. There was the time, in ``Tartuffe,'' when he had the
actors arrive at the tent on a wagon, as if they were members of a
road company of the Comedie Francaise. And there are times when the
space uses them, as on the Fourth of July weekend last year, when
teen-agers setting off firecrackers nearby provided inadvertent
sound and lighting effects for ``Twelfth Night.'' A company member
had to explain to the audience that the celebration was not of the
festival's devising. Another evening, during ``Titus,'' the power
blew, and the cast performed with flashlights.
</P>
<P>
   On the opening night of ``Measure,'' the tent is packed with
people, not mosquitoes. O'Brien sits in a seat near the back, a
legal pad in his lap. There will be notes for the actors, a couple
more rehearsals, and O'Brien is in essence done for the year. It's
back to custom database applications, and thoughts of next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking very strongly about doing `Richard III,''' he
said. ``I'll latch onto something and just sort of daydream. I
picture what something might look like in that space.''
</P>
<P>
   And already, he's hearing music. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival is offering two comedies,
``Measure for Measure,'' and ``The Taming of the Shrew,'' in

ELDERS URGES BLACK CHURCHES TO TEACH ABOUT SEXUALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER WALSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sex talk in church is usually taboo, but it needs
to be a common topic of sermons and discussion, especially in black
churches, former surgeon general Joycelyn Elders said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you don't like talking about sex from the pulpit,''
Elders said in the keynote address at the National Black Religious
Summit on Sexuality. ``When we have a problem with education, we go
to the church. When we have a problem with racism, we go to the
church. We've got a crisis that requires crisis intervention. I'm
asking that the church get involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-day summit, sponsored by the Black Church Initiative,
brought together about 600 ministers, church leaders, and health
professionals to address sexuality issues in the black church.
</P>
<P>
   Although almost all of the participants cheered in agreement
with Elders's message, which included teaching about birth control,
sexually transmitted diseases, and abortion, others thought she was
sending the wrong message to today's youth.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, the Rev. Wesley Roberts of the People's Baptist
Church and president of the Black Ministerial Alliance of Greater
Boston said the church should only preach abstinence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are other places that can give them information about
birth control methods,'' he said in a phone interview. ``I think we
should be careful to not tell them that promiscuity is OK.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Glenn Campbell of the Central Congressional Church in
Boston, who is attending the summit, said he is trying to start sex
education programs in the Boston area, but it is not easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to get the black church to deal with the
issues,'' said Campbell after Elders's speech. ``It's not that we
don't want to, it's that we don't know how.''
</P>
<P>
   Elders, who was fired as surgeon general in 1994 after
suggesting sex education classes include information about
masterbation, said it is unrealistic to think teenagers will not
have sex just because they are told not to. ``The vows of
abstinence break far more easily than condoms,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the congregation, Elders said, need to play a key
role in encouraging sex education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Preachers don't preach about it because the mothers in the
front row will want to throw them out of the church,'' she said.
``We don't want to talk about it in church because it says they did
something wrong. They're sinners. What good is church if it's not
going to save sinners?''
</P>
<P>
   Christhol McClain, a 16-year-old from Washington attending the
conference, said the church might be the only place where teens can
turn for information about sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't taught at home, it needs to be taught in the
church,'' McClain said. ``Kids are getting worse and worse, and we
need to do something about it. The church thinks you should keep
sex on the hush-up and it's not like that. Some kids don't know
anything about sex. If you don't tell them about it, they'll go out
and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Elders, who is now a professor at the University of Arkansas
School of Medical Science, said teaching that premarital sex is
immoral needs to be put aside so sex education can take center
stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to stop talking about morals and start teaching
responsibility,'' Elders said. ``Ignorance is not bliss. We've
tried it for a thousand years. It's not working so we need to try
education.''
</P>
<P>
   With more black teenagers getting pregnant and blacks accounting
for almost 50 percent of AIDS cases, black churches are the ideal
spot to start prevention and education measures, Elders said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to start talking about it where more black people go
than anywhere else _ that's the church,'' she said. ``It's time
that we as people of faith come out of the closets and serve that
God we talk about on Sundays.''

probably never imagined that by the end of the 20th century,
thousands of people would regularly turn out to hear electronic
music in clubs and that the futuristic sounds are now taken for

uses a heliography technique to place images on suitcases, Venetian

American investors, where are money managers placing their bets

   MUTFUND-PERFORMANCE (Undated) _ In the long-running debate
between managers of funds that search for cheap stocks and those
that chase the fastest-growing companies, neither was an exultant
winner. The growth funds that had dominated for most of the long
bull market for stocks flamed out, but their value-seeking
counterparts did not exactly soar from their ash piles. An
interest-bearing checking account turned out to be a better place
to stash cash than either broad category of stock fund. By Patrick

<P>
   MUTFUND-STRATEGIES (Undated) _ On behalf of financial planners,
academics, investment advisers and self-anointed experts
everywhere, I apologize. It appears that much of what you have been
told over the last 30 years about the benefits of international
diversification has been greatly exaggerated. In fact, according to
a new study, those benefits are less than half as great as
originally thought. By Mark Hulbert.

   MUTFUND-ESSAY (Undated) _ Commentary: If you are like me, all

something so fuzzy as an investment philosophy is no easy feat but
can't we do any better than a bunch of polygons, sailing vessels
and oak trees? By Patrick McGeehan.

   MUTFUND-BONDS (Undated) _ Do not be put off by how eye-glazingly
abstruse the subject sounds: A bill making its way through Congress
to change how government-sponsored agencies like Freddie Mac and
Fannie Mae are regulated could, if enacted, have some profound
effects on the portfolios of millions of ordinary investors. By
Abby Schultz.

   MUTFUND-INVESTORS (Undated) _ Meet the managed account, which
many people view as the latest threat to the 75-year-old mutual
fund industry. It used to be that only a privileged few could
afford their own money manager, but in the last few years assets in
privately managed accounts have swelled. Credit, in part, a bull
market that has more than doubled the number of millionaire
households since 1983, to five million. By Danny Hakim.
</P>
<P>
   MUTFUND-JUNKBONDS (Undated) _ Remember junk bonds? It was the
play stuff of Michael Milken, mother's milk of the 1980s
leveraged-buyout craze and eventually a symbol of that decade's
decadence. In recent quarters, junk bonds have logged some of their
worst performance in almost a decade. By Kate Berry.

<P>
   MUTFUND-RETIRE (Undated) _ Because saving for retirement had
become a crucial issue for Americans, The New York Times in 1993
asked five mutual-fund experts how they would invest a hypothetical
nest egg of $50,000 for someone who planned to retire in 20 years
or more. Each quarter since then, the five portfolios have been
reviewed and fine-tuned and their performances compared in these
pages. With results from the second quarter of 2000, the exercise
concludes, and the participants discuss what they, and investors,
have learned along the way. By Carole Gould.

<P>
   MUTFUND-MANAGERS (Undated) _ There were swoons and rebounds, and
then more again of the same. But by the end of the second quarter,
the stock market had provided enough bad news to push every major
category of United States diversified equity funds into negative
territory for the period. Over all, domestic diversified stock
funds lost 4.3 percent. What funds managed to shine as stormy
weather lashed the markets? Generally, the winners owned shares in
companies in old-economy sectors, like oil and gas, as well as in
health care and some financial services. Managers of three
top-performing funds talked about the resurgence of
once-beaten-down sectors and what they expect from the stock market
during the remainder of the year. By Carole Gould.

 &HT;    Baseball rolling out All-Star festivities
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Atlanta will be awash in baseballs this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism officials plan to roll out 100 giant baseballs as part
of a summer-long exhibit tied to Major League Baseball's All-Star
Game here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Colorfully decorated baseballs will be displayed around the
city, including Centennial Olympic Park, Underground Atlanta and
Turner Field. The promotion is similar to Cows on Parade, an
exhibit held in Chicago last year.
</P>
<P>
   Like in Chicago, at the end of the exhibit, the balls will be
auctioned, with proceeds going to the local arts community and
sports-related charities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the launch, not the ending,'' said Bill Howard, vice
president of tourism and public relations for the Atlanta
Convention and Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, 115 baseballs have been sold, and there are commitments
for numerous others, Howard said. Initially, officials had hoped to
sell 500 baseballs, but production schedules and the amount of time
need to position the balls forced them to scale back to 300.
</P>
<P>
   Still ``if we can reach 300 we will have met all of our goals,''
Howard said. ``This is a very attainable goal. We're already a
third of the way there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-five percent of the balls have been designed by
professional artists. Somes are designated to represent Major
League Baseball teams, but others can be decorated how the buyer
chooses.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Atlanta Hilton &AMP; Towers has a
chocolate-covered baseball in the lobby of its hotel on Courtland
Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of visitors,'' said Hilton General Manager
Dick Groves. ``There's a lot of picture-taking.''
</P>
<P>
   Today also marks the start of the John Hancock All-Star FanFest,
a baseball-themed interactive attraction at the Georgia World
Congress Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're off to a great start,'' said Gary Stokan, president of
the Atlanta Sports Council.
</P>
<P>
   The All-Star Game is expected to have an economic impact of $50
million.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism officials say landing the event helps bolster the city's
image in sporting events circles.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is one of four cities in the running for the 2005 Super
Bowl. Others are Miami, Oakland, Calif., and Jacksonville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Stokan said the city also is making bids for ESPN's X Games in
2003 and 2004, the 2004 National Figure Skating Championship and
the Goodwill Games in 2005.

SAMPRAS MAY BE HURTING, BUT SO IS HIS OPPONENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With TEN-WIMBLEDON) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Pete Sampras' latest injury has all but
been dusted for prints and sent to the lab. For more than a week,
he has described the tendinitis living inside of his lower left
shin, but it has been treated as an allegation and not a fact.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone believes Sampras is in pain. And if he is, no one
wants to hear about it from a six-time Wimbledon champion who has
tiptoed through five unseeded players on his way to another
non-threatening opponent in Friday's semifinal. The unassuming
Vladimir Voltchkov _ a penny-pinching qualifier who had to borrow
shorts and shoes during his extended stay at Wimbledon _ is the
only player in Sampras' way of reaching the finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``When players go out there and see Pete Sampras totally
dominate, it's aggravating to have him say he's not feeling
right,'' said John McEnroe, who is an analyst for NBC and the Davis
Cup captain. ``Pete talks about it, and it's like he's saying, `If
I lose, it's because of the injury. But by the way, I'm about to be
in the finals again.'''
</P>
<P>
   He could even make history. The injury has created diversion
from Sampras' chase of Roy Emerson's record even though he is in
pouncing position to win his 13th Grand Slam event. First, there is
Voltchkov. Next, Andre Agassi may await. But the second-seeded
Agassi has a far more treacherous path to the finals. He will play
the 12th-seeded Patrick Rafter, who is playing his best tennis
since shoulder surgery in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to see Pat playing well,'' said Agassi, who leads
the head-to-head matchup with Rafter, 7-3, which includes his
semifinal victory here against the Aussie last year. ``I think he's
a great athlete with a lot to offer the sport of tennis. This is a
great arena to compete against him in because it's Wimbledon. He's
one of the best competitors out there, if not the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi also possesses untouchable desire. With his instincts and
quick hands, with his brainpower and fancy footwork, Agassi has
unveiled his magic over the fortnight. He escaped a five-set match
against Todd Martin in the second round, then dodged the atomic
serve of Mark Philippoussis in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 thing against Andre is that you have to serve
well,'' said Rafter, whose kick-serve can be problematic for
Agassi. ``And you've got to serve well all day. If you can do that,
you've got a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The odds for Voltchkov to advance are slim. But the smiling
22-year-old from Belarus doesn't seem flustered by the occasion,
just grateful for the chance to double his career winnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``To play Pete in the semifinals of Wimbledon, what else do you
wish for?'' said Voltchkov, who will make $193,000 for stepping on
the court. ``It's like a dream come true.''
</P>
<P>
   The health of Sampras shouldn't be a factor. Although he hasn't
been practicing between matches, Sampras has been moving well on
the court, seemingly unencumbered by the pains viewed with
suspicion by other players. The acupuncture treatments seem to
help, but getting rest has been the best cure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been different not practicing,'' Sampras said.
``Mentally, it's a little unsettling. I've been dealt this hand,
and there's not much I can do about it now; Just got to go out
there and try my best, just work through it. It's not ideal, but
I'll just go out there with a good frame of mind and et it go.''
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe Worried About Sampras
</P>
<P>
   John McEnroe's concerns about Sampras' injury extend beyond
Wimbledon. With a Davis Cup matchup in Spain just two weeks away,
the captain of the team doesn't know if Sampras will be available.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get the suspicion that there won't be good news at the end
of the day for Davis Cup,'' McEnroe said.
</P>
<P>
   Questions About TV Coverage
</P>
<P>
   Tennis fans were left wondering (and sputtering) about when they
would actually get to see the broadcast of the hot Wimbledon
women's semifinal between Venus and Serena Williams on NBC Thursday
afternoon. When NBC's four-hour taped broadcast of the matches
began at 1 p.m., the Williams sisters were nowhere to be seen.
Instead, NBC began its coverage with portions of Wednesday's men's
quarterfinal between Pete Sampras and Jan-Michael Gambill.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was Sampras-Gambill a day-old offering whose result was
already known, but viewers were also left in the dark as to exactly
when coverage of the Williams-Williams semifinal would begin.
Viewers were told that the day's ``featured match between the
Williams sisters would be at the conclusion'' of the
Sampras-Gambill quarterfinal. But the problem was ``the
conclusion'' was a long time coming and tennis fans never knew when
it would be: the Williamses finally took Center Court on NBC around
3 p.m., some two hours after the broadcast began.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we were trying to do was have the largest audience for
the second match,'' Cameron Blanchard, director of communications
for NBC, said by telephone from London, ``and research indicates
that the larger audience is available later in the afternoon. We
wanted that match to be the Williams sisters because the match was
so highly anticipated and the sisters have been such a big story.''
</P>
<P>
   So, why not show the women's semifinal between Lindsay Davenport
and Jelena Dokic first? Blanchard said that TNT, which has worked
in tandem with NBC to bring Wimbledon 2000 to U.S. viewers, ``had
Davenport'' for its telecast later Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We chose Sampras-Gambill first,'' Blanchard said, ``because
many of our viewers hadn't seen it.'' But many of TNT's viewers had
seen it ... on Wednesday.

CRITICS ASKING CLINTON TO STOP ADVANCING MISSILE DEFENSE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A leading critic of national missile defense,
Theodore A. Postol, said in a letter to President Clinton on
Thursday that Clinton's advisers had made misleading statements
about the proposed shield and urged creating an independent
commission of top scientists to evaluate the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Three major science groups also opposed the plan. The American
Physical Society, with 42,000 physicists; the Federation of
American Scientists; and the Union of Concerned Scientists jointly
announced that they had urged Clinton not to deploy a missile
defense system, regardless of how its ground-based interceptor
performed in a test on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   An anti-nuclear organization, Greenpeace, announced that it was
sending a Dutch icebreaker, the Arctic Sunrise, to a ``hazard
zone'' designated by the Air Force off the launching site at
Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., to try to stop the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. President, you have the finger on the Star Wars button,''
Greenpeace wrote in a letter to Clinton. ``We urge you take it off
and make the world a safer place.''
</P>
<P>
   To the Pentagon, the attacks might look like the revenge of the
scientists. Fifty Nobel laureates have said any movement to deploy
a missile defense system would be ``premature, wasteful and
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   The most relentless and detailed criticism has been from Postol,
a professor of science and national security studies at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He contended in his letter
Clinton that Pentagon officials had in recent weeks ``made numerous
technologically illiterate and highly misleading statements'' about
the missile proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Postol said a statement by a Defense Department official that
the system's X-band radar could discriminate between a real target
and a decoy was based on faulty science. Jacques Gensler, an
undersecretary for acquisition, technology and logistics, made the
statement at a news conference on June 20.
</P>
<P>
   Postol added that the contention at that news conference by Lt.
Gen. Ronald T. Kadish of the Air Force, director of the Ballistic
Missile Defense Organization at the Pentagon, that the decoy to be
used on Friday was ``representative'' of the expected decoy threat
was also false.
</P>
<P>
   In statements Thursday, the Pentagon defended the integrity of
its program without addressing Postol's specific statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Postol has raised issues that the independent review team
and the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization are addressing,'' a
spokesman for the Pentagon, Kenneth Bacon, said in a statement.
``Developing a national missile defense system poses difficult
technical challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen ``is confident that his team is
following a systematic and reasonable course to solve these
problems,'' Bacon added.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the National Security Council, P.J. Crowley,
said, ``We've asked the Pentagon for an analysis of the questions
he raises, and the Pentagon is in the process of getting back to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said that weather conditions appeared good and that
the test on Friday was on schedule.

FLYING SOLO, HENLEY EYES THE FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use after July 9, 2000, by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, Eagles singer-drummer Don Henley famously
sang in ``Hotel California'' that ``you can check out anytime you
like but you can never leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, the quintessential Southern California rocker did leave _
but it took the Northridge earthquake to push him out.
</P>
<P>
   Henley _ the voice and co-writer of such classics as ``Witchy
Woman,'' ``One of These Nights,'' ``Best of My Love,'' ``New Kid in
Town,'' ``Hotel California,'' ``Heartache Tonight,'' ``Desperado,''
``Sunset Grill'' and ``The Last Resort'' _ and his future wife
moved to Dallas after the 1994 quake destroyed the dream home he
designed.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Inside Job'' (Warner Bros.), his first album of new
material in 11 years, Henley writes of the peace and contentment
he's found since.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening line to the song ``Everything is Different Now,''
Henley, who appears Saturday and Sunday at Universal Amphitheatre,
sings: ``I hate to tell you this, but I'm very, very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Married in 1995 to Sharon Summerall, who like Henley is a Texas
native, the couple is raising three children. In 1990, Henley
founded the Walden Woods Project (www.walden.org), an environmental
preservation organization. And he and Eagles partner Glenn Frey
were recently inducted into the Songwriter's Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the Eagles, Henley shares in the biggest-selling
album ever in the U.S. The Eagles' ``Greatest Hits 1971-75'' passed
``Thriller'' for that honor.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Henley's best-selling new album contains plenty of
pointed social and political commentary, but there are also songs
celebrating the happy state of his home life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been inspiring,'' Henley, 53, says of his slow-lane life
today. ``I really believe I've rediscovered my better self. I feel
like I did when I was in college.''
</P>
<P>
   Henley, who won a Grammy Award in 1990 for his previous solo
disc, the 6-million-selling ``The End of the Innocence,''
originally came to Los Angeles in 1970 with his band, Shiloh,
before joining Linda Ronstadt's band and forming the Eagles in
1971.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles, whose honeyed harmonies obscured the lyrics' dark
view of life in the Golden State, have since reunited for tours and
special events, including a date last New Year's Eve at Staples
Center that Henley calls ``one of the best shows we've ever done.''
</P>
<P>
   And we found that while talking with Henley by phone from his
home that is outspokenness isn't confined to his lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's your take on the corporate mergers that have left few
major labels standing?
</P>
<P>
   A: To paraphrase Charles Dickens, it's the best of times and
worst of times. I'm deeply concerned with the corporatization of
America and the world in general. Everyday I see companies being
formed that in earlier times would be considered monopolies. And we
have a Congress now that is in the habit of looking the other way.
Anything goes. You can merge, conglomerate, globalize, and it's
frightening to me. I wake up in the morning and don't know who I
work for. It's particularly frightening in regards to the media
because things have been merged to the point where there are
serious conflicts of interest in terms of art and truth in
journalism. It isn't good for democracy, the decimation of truth,
art or culture.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You haven't spoken out about the forthcoming presidential
election. What's your take?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've sat this election out so far because I've been busy with
this album and my family. But (Vice President Al) Gore is the best
choice we have. I certainly think he's the best alternative. With
(Texas Gov. George W.) Bush, Texas is the most polluted state in
the union. It's surpassed Los Angeles as having the worst pollution
in the country. Texas is not only the most polluted but it's the
most pollution-producing state in the nation. So, I would much
prefer Gore on that front. Texas also has problems with its
education system. Texas has the highest teen pregnancy rate in the
U.S. and over a million kids who are hungry. Texas has serious air
quality and water problems. People need to look a little deeper
into the presidential race. Bush has a hands-off style of
governing. He's a non-interference kind of guy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: To change the subject, what are the chances of the Eagles
getting together again?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's 50-50. It changes week to week and month to month. I'm
currently concerned with my new record and touring behind it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You left the Geffen imprint before it was merged and
dismantled and you moved to Warners. What was behind the move?
</P>
<P>
   A: I saw the Geffen thing coming. I left happily because I
didn't think they were doing a very good job promoting my work. I
wanted out and I got out. I'm very happy at Warners. They had the
Eagles catalog by and large and some of my solo work. So Warners
always felt like home to me. And my manager Irving Azoff has his
own label there. I have longstanding relationships with some of the
people who remain there. Unfortunately, (longtime former Warners
execs) Mo Ostin and Lenny Waronker are gone, which was an enormous
mistake. But there are still some good people there and so far I'm
extremely pleased with the new record. The reception at Radio has
been tremendous.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You have a new road band. What do you look for in touring
musicians?
</P>
<P>
   A: Musicianship is first with personality running a close second
since I'm going to have to spend a lot of time in close proximity
with these people. They should have a sense of humor, a level head
and they shouldn't have any substance abuse problems. They're all
funny, good looking, musically accomplished family men.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are your feelings on Napster?
</P>
<P>
   A: I take stealing very seriously. I don't care what kind of
spin they put on it, it's stealing plain and simple. Singers and
songwriters and recording artists should be compensated for their
work just like everyone else. I cannot fathom any kind of
justification for stealing the works of artists who depend on their
work for their livelihood. And whether an artist is wealthy or
poor, stealing is still stealing. And it's wrong. I haven't filed
suit against Napster, but I'll eventually be part of a class action
suit.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about the Internet itself?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Internet can be used for good such as education and the
decimation of news but it's also the repository for a lot of
garbage which is proved everyday by people like Jenny Jones and
Jerry Springer who are exploiting the problems of working class
people and degrading them at the same time. The same goes for the
Internet. It's an absolutely wonderful tool for communication, for
education, even for creating a certain type of community. But on
the other hand there's a tremdnous amount of litter along the
information highway. Any technology can be abused and will be.
Unfortunately, our lawmakers are sadly behind the curve and the law
has not kept up with the technology.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the record industry still unfair in terms of contracts?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's not as bad as it was then. But it still has a ways to go
in terms of fairness. Even if they give you a good contract, it's
hard to collect the money. You have to do regular audits and fight
every step of the way to get what's coming to you. It's a constant
struggle. You're never sure if you're getting what's coming to you.
</P>
<P>
   Q: One last thing. When you first heard those million-dollar
Eagles harmonies back in 1971, did you know the sound would take
off the way it did?
</P>
<P>
   A: I honestly didn't think of it in million-dollar terms. I was
young and filled with a sense of wonder and possibility. I was
mostly thinking about music and girls and not the money. I hoped to
make a living but I never expected our success would reach the
level it reached. I'm truly grateful for all that. But I don't like
to rest on my laurels. I'm more concerned with today and tomorrow. &QL;

AS LONG AS THERE'S TV, WHO NEEDS REALITY?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use after July 9, 2000, by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (ITAL)Read it here first: The next step in the evolution of
entertainment will be wiring your own home with hidden cameras and
watching your own family on television nonstop rather than
interacting with them personally.(END ITAL)
</P>
<P>
   The tagline for CBS's latest exercise in voyeurism is ```Big
Brother' _ They live. You watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinda says it all, doesn't it? Even though TV sells time to
advertisers offering you hundreds of different ways to have
entertaining life experiences, what it really boils down to is the
networks know we're all pathetic couch potatoes. Has anyone
somewhere wondered, why can't (ITAL)we(END ITAL) be the ones doing
the living?
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother,'' in case you haven't heard, has rounded up 10
Americans prone to exhibitionism and shamelessness, tossed them
into a maximum-security home on a studio lot in the Valley with but
two bedrooms and one bathroom for 100 days and displays all the
glorious, messy results on national TV. The show will air for a
half-hour Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays, and for an hour on
Thursday (when it will be live) and Saturday (when it will
basically recap the week's fun and excitement).
</P>
<P>
   What will make ``Big Brother'' truly extraordinary and
ground-breaking and all that is its Internet component, ensuring
that nothing the 10 guinea pigs do will be private. Four different
streams of live behavior emanating from the house will be available
24/7, allowing folks _ who would get arrested for peeping into
their next door neighbor's home _ to ogle and goggle and have their
minds boggled by the frictions and frissons experienced by people
who will become famous simply for being famous.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are any number of performance artists and
narcissists and venture capitalists who have created Web sites
where the bored and slack-jawed can watch them living their lives
and/or baring their breasts. (One has even filed a silly lawsuit
against CBS, claiming ``Big Brother's'' live Internet streams are
their idea). But those are rarefied sites with cult audiences
numbering in the hundreds, maybe thousands, most likely dozens.
``Big Brother,'' by dint of having a network-television forum
advertising the Internet component, could have millions of folks
spying on our bickerers and lovebirds.
</P>
<P>
   So, what might we see were we to log on at any given moment? In
order to give you budding voyeurs an idea of some of the
pulse-pounding entertainment you'll soon be able to catch, any
second of the day or night, I thoughtfully plugged in my own home.
Here are some of the heart-stopping highlights, variations upon
which you can expect to view when you log on to the ``Big Brother''

Who in their right mind would invite the world to watch an intimate

dignity anymore? Why do people believe that a life is invalid
unless it's filtered through the media? Why does everyone get so
absorbed into the lives of people they don't even know, just
because they're on TV or the Internet? Since when did frivolity
become the national pastime? If people expended the same energy on

OSCAR WOULD CRINGE AT THIS NEWS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Sportswriters aren't a dying breed. They just
tend to dress nicer, diet, brush their teeth and care about
relationships more these days.
</P>
<P>
   And that's usually where the dilemma begins.
</P>
<P>
   As if anyone outside the profession cares, this low-lying branch
of the media is fighting a constant image problem.
</P>
<P>
   We already deal with the fact that athletes treat us as a
necessary evil, readers constantly ridicule us, and we're generally
not much use to anyone except friends looking for free tickets.
</P>
<P>
   We're kinda lovable losers. At least in our own minds.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't help when, in the same week, a sportswriter is
included in People Magazine's list of the top 100 most eligible
bachelors and Oscar Madison goes to the big press box buffet in the
sky.
</P>
<P>
   What message does this send out? We not only have to worry about
how we look, but how compatible we'd be with someone of the
opposite sex - and whether we believe Pete Rose belongs in the Hall
of Fame. There aren't enough hours in the day for all that.
Especially if there's a game going on.
</P>
<P>
   If everyone believed that Walter Matthau's cigar-smelling,
mustard- stained character from ``The Odd Couple'' was an
exaggeration of a typical sportswriter, all the better. Scribes
tend to relish the fact that they're traditionally cast off among
the undesirables, oblivious to those who actually have a life. They
can play in their own world, get paid for it, and don't have to
bother with anyone else. A professional fan, if you want to call
him one.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, they don't have to buy new clothes every season.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, probably the worst thing you can do to a bona fide
sportswriter is take their shirts to the cleaners and have them
pressed. Which makes us wonder why anyone would want to marry one.
</P>
<P>
   While the athletes they cover admit to giving it 110 percent on
the field, the sportswriters' divorce rate has to be in the same
percentile. Some make it, and God bless 'em. But those of us who've
made multiple trips to the license bureau only to have it later
revoked definitely make up for that.
</P>
<P>
   And we know who we are.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there's Dan Lebatard, a 31-year-old sports columnist for
the Miami Herald, telling People Magazine that he's looking for a
gal who's good around kids, makes him laugh and isn't afraid of
getting soaked (since he enjoys river rafting). His ideal date is
``somewhere quiet.'' And he admits, ``I've never been in love.''
</P>
<P>
   This, friends, is today's sportswriter. More human. More aware
of others. More weight conscious. More domestic.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, no morons.
</P>
<P>
   So ends the Madison era, the character with character flaws,
sportswriters so comfortable with their career choice they can put
on whatever smelly clothes they so desire without the fear of
offending anyone, since they were wearing the same thing. And make
generally lousy money, offset by the fact ... well, at least
everyone else was in the same stinky boat.
</P>
<P>
   So, apparently, begins the Lebatard legacy - Gen X-tra
sensitive, where we care how we look to other people, maybe some
even hoping that a TV network picks up on their witty prose and
considers them camera-friendly enough to put on the air. Oh, right,
and give them more money.
</P>
<P>
   So what's a real sportswriter to do? Maybe it's like when Payne
Stewart used to wear the knickers when he played golf. There's got
to be a way to mesh the two - retain the charm of the job but move
into the 21st century without being displaced.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, how much does a good haircut go for these days?
</P>
<P>
   Getting it straight: NBC's coverage Thursday of the Williams
sisters' semifinals eventually aired in Los Angeles from 1 to 5
p.m. - two hours after the time block started. Not that it helps
for anyone who set their VCR or tuned in at 10 a.m., when NBC had
been showing Wimbledon all week, for the match that actually took
place several hours earlier (the result of which was specifically
not given on the KNBC Channel 4 news at 11 a.m.)
</P>
<P>
   Who would have awaken at 7 a.m. to watch this unique match live?
Seems by the phone calls we got in the office Thursday morning,
many.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but you forget. This is NBC. &QL;

WHAT SMOKES &QL; 
--You gotta see ``You Gotta See This!'' a new weekly sports version
of ``American's Funniest Videos'' produced and aired on Fox Sports
Net every Saturday night at 11:30! This week's installment includes
rodeo star Tuff Hedeman getting thrown from a bull and breaking
every bone in his face! No, really! &QL; 
--Starting with its coverage of the Home Run Derby on Monday (5
p.m.), ESPN, with the help of Major League Baseball, starts
offering a Spanish-language simulcast that includes graphics,
commercials and player interviews in Spanish. It'll be up to cable
systems that can accomodate the extra feed to find a channel to
give viewers for this service. &QL; 
--Channel 13 sports reporter Kenny Sargent has started a weekly
motor sports talk show (7-8 p.m. Sunday) on 97.1 KLSX-FM. &QL; 
--Highlights from Jim Rome's Cleveland ``World Tour'' stop airs
Wednesday (8 p.m.) on Fox Sports Net. &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES &QL; 
--Unbridled bootlicking on the part of Fox Sports Net's L.A.
Regional News crew during its first week on the job. Obviously, the
scriptwriters have been trying inject a lot of rah-rahism instead
of results into the otherwise nicely formatted show, but is that
really going to fly around here? Calling the Dodgers ``our guys''
every other sentence should be a parody of how a local sportscast
goes, not something to imitate. The anchors should be renamed
Illiad and Odyssey - both creations of Homer. &QL; 
--What a surprise - Sports Illustrated baseball writer Jeff
Pearlman has hung another player out to dry. Just as the
unnecessary John Rocker story he wrote back in December set off
fireworks, Pearlman's cover piece on Toronto's David Wells has been
called ``a total joke'' by the pitcher because of how it focuses on
his weight and not so much on his ability. &QL; 
--``Hi, this is !racepay!Bill Walton!off! for Casa de Cadillac

<P>
   &QL; 
While the airwaves and films are populated with plenty of
whodunnits, the most compelling mysteries are cerebral. These
stories, however, rarely make for compelling viewing.
</P>
<P>
   But if you can tear yourself away from the reality-based show du
jour, ``Longitude'' on A&AMP;E is a handsomely mounted and absorbing
!ital!true story of the man who, after a lifetime struggle, solved
one of the greatest mysteries in history, creating a clock that
allowed sailors to know their position at sea. And while
``Longitude'' is four hours (it will be repeated), it's well worth
the time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1707, after a maritime disaster caused by an incorrect
calculation of a fleet's position (``guess'' is more appropriate,
since navigators had no way of really knowing then, using dead
reckoning and an unreliable method of computing knots), the British
Parliament offered a sum of 20,000 pounds (about $5 mil &QL; 
lion today) to anyone who could solve the problem of finding
longitude at sea.
</P>
<P>
   More than saving lives was at stake, though. Any nation that
could find an accurate method of navigation could rule the economy
of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Taking up the challenge in 1730 was a Yorkshire carpenter named
John Harrison (Michael Gambon), a man with no formal education and
who had never been out to sea. Harrison, though, already had
fashioned a wooden clock that kept better time than the one in the
Royal Observatory.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a mere carpenter trying to solve a problem that had
stumped the best minds of the land didn't sit well with the
academic establishment at the time. While he did receive
encouragement from Edmund Halley (yes, that Halley), the Astronomer
Royal (John Wood), another famous scientist, Sir Isaac Newton,
prejudiced the board against the problem being solved by a
mechanical method.
</P>
<P>
   So even when Harrison almost succeeds his first time out with a
test at sea with his first device, he's met with resistance.
Eventually, though, he receives enough backing to continue his
work. Harrison, however, knows there is a flaw in his design.
</P>
<P>
   What occurs then is a nearly 50-year quest by the clockmaker, in
which he has to overcome both naysayers and his own doubts. For a
man obsessed with time, Harrison's own time meant little too him.
All of this came at a personal cost, including watching his son,
William, who he wanted to win the prize for so he grow up a
gentleman, grow instead into a middle-aged man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Longitude'' takes one great liberty with Dava Sobel's
critically acclaimed book in order to give the filmed version more
of a more dramatic reading. Rupert Gould, who is a minor character
in her book, becomes something of a parallel story in this version.
Gould is a World War I British Naval officer who becomes obsessed
with restoring Harrison's four clocks, which have fallen in
disrepair in the cellar of the Royal Observatory. There he asks
Frank Dyson, the current Astronomer Royal (Alec McCowen), if he can
put the clocks back into working order. Dyson agrees, but there is
no money involved and Gould must do it in his spare time.
</P>
<P>
   With Gould's mental health in an already fragile state and with
his wife unable to understand, Gould's obsession, like Harrison's,
takes its toll.
</P>
<P>
   The more interesting story, though, is Harrison's, whose
obstacles, including facing more rigorous class distinctions and
just plain ignorance, are external, rather than Gould's, which take
the form of inner demons. Harrison's fears stem more from his fears
that someone would steal his plans and cheat him out of his reward.
They were entirely unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   The story of ``Longitude'' is not an easy one to tell. Taking
place over a 50-year period, as one might expect, characters come
and go. And some of the more esoteric aspects of the tale are
smoothed over. But like Harrison's quest, the show ultimately
triumphs.
</P>
<P>
   Gambon is superb as Harrison, and Oscar-winner Irons has made a
living playing vulnerable Englishmen who must keep a stiff upper
lip. The cast is peppered with marvelous actors such as Wood,
McCowan, Barbara Leigh-Hunt as Gould's mother and Frank Finlay as
Admiral Wager.
</P>
<P>
   But the most credit should go to writer-director Charles
Sturridge, who get this unwieldy undertaking on course, making
reality (that's what history is, after all) entertaining. &QL;

PATIENTS' BILL SET TO BECOME CAMPAIGN ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL A. LEWIS  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, Mo. _ With uncertainty growing as to whether Congress
will pass legislation to define patients' rights, President Clinton
traveled outside Washington on Thursday to set the stage for
turning the issue into political ammunition for the Democrats
during the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an obligation in Washington to pass a strong patients'
bill of rights,'' Clinton said to dozens of health professionals
and other supporters at the University of Missouri campus here. He
praised a version of the bill that passed the House last year with
the support of Democrats and some Republicans, but criticized one
enacted by the Republican majority in the Senate, which he said
might be worse than not passing any bill.
</P>
<P>
   A patients' bill of rights would, for the first time, set
federal standards for private health insurance, notably health
maintenance organizations and other forms of managed care. For
decades, insurance has been regulated by the states.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional battle over a bill is hovering in the twilight
between compromise and breakdown. While continuing negotiations,
both sides are also looking ahead to carry the battle into the fall
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton warmly praised Missouri's Democratic governor, Mel
Carnahan, who is running for the U.S. Senate. Carnahan, who stood
at Clinton's side along with a phalanx of white-coated health
professionals, backed a patients' bill of rights that became state
law in 1997. He hopes to unseat Sen. John Ashcroft, the Republican
incumbent who has resolutely supported his party's leaders in
pressing for a more limited version.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft said in a statement Thursday that he had always
supported ``a real patients' bill of rights.'' Regarding the
president's remarks, he said that ``people have a right to expect
leadership to fix problems, not to fix blame.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two primary differences between the parties. The House
version supported by Clinton would cover people in every health
plan in the nation, an estimated 161 million subscribers. The
Republican Senate version would apply to those not already covered
by state laws, an estimated 56 million people.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the House version would make it easier for patients
to sue their HMOs and employers than the Senate bill would.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., the assistant majority leader, has
argued that legislation making it easier to sue employers would
only discourage them from offering health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has always been my goal to send an enforceable, responsible
patients' bill of rights to the president this year,'' Nickles said
in a statement Thursday. ``But what I will not do is to pass a bill
that would cause employers to drop health insurance, dramatically
increase costs and force millions of Americans into the ranks of
the uninsured.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of which version of a patients' bill of rights is
preferable is likely to figure in several races in the fall. It has
already become an issue in Hillary Rodham Clinton's U.S. Senate
race in New York against Rep. Rick A. Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio voted against the bipartisan House version last year.
Lazio's spokesman said that the congressman ``has consistently
supported the Republican version, which is a patients' bill of
rights rather than a lawyer's right to bill.''

   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA-$ADV09 _ ONI, Georgia _ High in still snowy

Chechen rebels have found a near

   impenetrable lair. From these hideouts, the rebels have
unleashed a new round of fighting their almost yearlong war against
the Russian army. The worrisome problem is that the rebels have

   MEXICO-REVOLUTION _ MEXICO CITY _ It's being called the second
Mexican Revolution, the Revolution of the 21st Century, Mexico's
Velvet Revolution, the electoral earthquake. To the surprise of
virtually all political observers here, Mexicans rose up last
Sunday and decisively ended 71 years of domination by the world's
longest-reigning political party. In just one week, life in Mexico
has changed spirtually if not materially. Many people sense a
mantle of control has been lifted. A federal employee here who was
forced to pass out literature for the ruling party said she hopes
such coercion is dead in Mexico. A TV comic pushed the envelope on
freedom of expression by performing a sketch using amusing video of
President-elect Vicente Fox, and then bantering with the real Fox
in a live telephone interview. The audience went wild. Mexico is
enjoying a democratic fiesta, even though
</P>

   MEXICO-PRI _ MEXICO CITY _ The worst of times for Mexico's

several crippling peso devaluations and spate of fratricidal
assassinations. And now the ultimate _ unexpected defeat at the
polls of 71 years in power. Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary
Party is in the throes of a crisis, as its leaders squabble among
one another and stunned supporters wonder what will happen to their
special favors. President Ernesto Zedillo, who accepted the PRI's
defeat and won praise from abroad and the opposition here, is being
reviled within his own party as a traitor. The PRI will now be a
minority power in the Senate and Congress, and a minor voice in
Mexico City and other key areas. Can the dinosaur survive?

   MIDEAST-SUMMIT _ JERUSALEM _ As they head into a summit meeting
Tuesday, Israelis and Palestinians are closer than they've ever
been to making peace. But, they're still readying themselves for
war. The solutions are out there. Israeli officials have leaked
proposals that would be the largest concessions Israel ever offered
and Palestinians have shown increased flexibility in living next to
the Jewish state. The toughest issues are Jerusalem, resettlement
of refugees, borders and water. Each has a number of possible
solutions. But, peacemakers on both sides face stiff opposition
from their own publics. Should the summit fail, no one knows what
will follow but it could be violence. Palestinians are preparing to
declare statehood and are said to be gathering weapons. Israeli
officers are threatening to use ``tanks and planes'' against a
Palestinian uprising. A look at the issues and risks of the summit.

   SURPLUS _ WASHINGTON _ Like Uncle Sam finding a $20 bill in the
pocket of his striped pants on laundry day, the U.S. government
last month came up with an extra $100 billion in revenue over the
next 10 years. While this boost in the projected federal surplus
certainly sounds like good news, it raises some disquieting
questions. How can revenue estimates change so quickly, and can
they go down as fast as they went up? And could the new revenues
lead lawmakers to create spending or benefit programs that would be
hard to roll back if the windfall evaporates? (Deans, Cox News

   BAXTER-COLUMN _ How would Southern politics change _ or would it
change at all _ if we knew all the dire predictions about global
warming were really true? With all the scientific controversy over
that subject we can't be sure. But if there's one area which could
be looked at as a present-day laboratory for the consequences of
such an unprecedented crisis, it lies along the Carolina coastline.
That's because whether global warming affects it or not, there is
convincing evidence that over the next 30 years, storms likarolina
last year will increase in frequency. That increases the potential
like more environmental disasters like the one last year in which
North Carolinians saw their rivers polluted with the carcasses of
thousands of drowned hogs. But it also brings a risk of political
disaster, as South Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges found out last year
when he ordered the coast evacuated for a disaster which didn't
materialize. (Baxter, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   TRANSEXUAL-MINISTER _ The Rev. Erin Swenson's heart thumped
wildly. She was so close to panic that her fingertips tingled.
Facing her, the crowd crammed inside the Shallowford Presbyterian
Church in Atlanta stared at her in disbelief. Swenson, an ordained
minister and father of two daughters, had just walked to the front
of the church in a green dress, heels and an eggshell-white blouse.
She was going to speak publicly for the first time about a
49-year-old secret that had driven her to thoughts of suicide.
Swenson told the hushed crowd that she was a woman born in a man's
body. Now that she had taken steps to correct that, she made an
unprecedented request before the assembly of Presbyterian church
leaders: Allow her to retain her ordination as a minister. Five
years later, Swenson is stepping back in the spotlight. She _ along
with , her ex-wife, daughter and father _ is are finally talking
about the extraordinary journey _ as a family and as individuals _
they have taken together since that autumn morning. (Blake, Atlanta

   COVER _ The idea seems obvious, so why didn't anyone think of it
before? ``Women get to accessorize with great shoes and handbags,
so why shouldn't our Palm Pilot covers and planners express who we
are and be fabulous also?'' asks Sunny Knox. The Dayton native, who
now makes her home in Los Angeles, theorized that women would be
anxious to replace ``black and boring'' accessory covers with those
more funky and fashionable. She figured right. Today Sunshine Knox
(her business card simply reads ``Sunshine'') is the president and
designer of Sunny Kate, a 1-year-old company that's already sold
thousands of items and is quickly becoming known for its upscale
accessories for women.

   ADAMS-YOSEMITE _ Yosemite National Park draws a whopping 3.6
million visitors a year _ making it one of the busiest sites in the
park system _ and many credit Ansel Adams' majestic black-and-white
photographs for its popularity. ``Every year I have to have an
Ansel Adams calendar of the park,'' said the Rev. David Johnson, a
Welches, Ore., minister. ``Now I want to see the vantage points
firsthand.'' The park plays to the fascination visitors have with
Adams by offering camera walks filled with basic instruction and
nifty details on where some of his classic images were executed. We
took the walk but also hiked independently, trying to view this
magnificent land in a way similar to the great photographer.

eclectic collection of alternative country artists too esoteric for
mainstream radio. Earle's new album, ``Transcendental Blues,'' sold

bookstores all over metro Atlanta Saturday when the kids finally
got their way. Bedtime, closing time, suddenly it was all as
inconsequential as mortals are in the magical world where Potter
the pubescent warlock exists. As beleagured store employees finally
ripped open the cartons containing precious copies of ``Harry
Potter and the Goblet of Fire,'' youngsters for whom Dumbledore and
Snape are rapidly becoming their generation's version of Paul and
Ringo plotted to get in there early and stay up late reading. Eight
hours later, the scene repeated itself as the same stores opened

 &HT;    IBM, Compaq jointly to offer data storage products
 &HT;    By John Pletz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - IBM Corp. and Compaq Corp. are joining forces in
an assault on the lucrative and growing market for Internet data
storage that many see as crucial for computer companies.
</P>
<P>
   IBM and Compaq will invest a combined $1 billion in a
partnership in which each company will cross-sell a limited amount
of the other's products rebadged under their own names.
</P>
<P>
   IBM brings the Shark, its high-end, mainframe storage product
line, while Compaq will chip in with StorageWorks, a Windows NT
offering. Compaq also will sell some systems-management software
made by Austin-based IBM subsidiary Tivoli Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Together, IBM and Compaq believe they can offer a top-to-bottom
package of products ranging from the low-end NT platform to the
proprietary, high-end Unix and mainframe platforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compaq and IBM will compete fiercely on the software side of
things,'' said John McArthur, vice president of storage research at
research firm International Data Corp. ``Both think they've got
larger total market by making the software platform independent.''
</P>
<P>
   IDC projects that the market for storage products will be worth
$53 billion by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a ton of data out there on the Internet that has to be
stored,'' said Amir Ahari an analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray in Menlo Park, Calif. ``All the catalogs, data collected
for purchases _ that's all storage. And that's where the growth is.
Storage is going to be the oxygen to companies.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM and Compaq will work together to make sure their products
are compatible, which is a key issue in storage. Companies
operating various systems want to be able to access data created or
stored on different platforms.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer Corp. made its only acquisition last fall, buying
ConvergeNet, to solve that same problem. Dell expects to begin
selling the ConvergeNet product in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   IBM and others are pushing for an open standard that allows
different platforms to work together. It's a further assault on
Massachusetts-based EMC Corp., the leader in storage products and
IBM's chief rival, which is pushing a proprietary solution with its
own hardware standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``IBM is trying to build momentum, saying there's something else
besides EMC,'' Ahari said. ``IBM has an incentive to get out there
and build momentum for their products. It's huge (for Tivoli)
because Compaq has a huge installed base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compaq is second to none in the NT storage space, but Compaq
really needs to get the credibility to get into data centers.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Capellas, Compaq's chief executive, said he expects to
begin seeing ``significant'' revenue by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think IBM sees it that no matter what happens, they're going
to make money,'' Ahari said.
</P>
<P>
   It is the latest effort by IBM to partner with competitors. IBM
did its first partnership deal in March 1999 with Dell to license
technology from Big Blue. IBM later agreed to provide services to
Dell customers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it made technology deals with Dell, Cisco Systems,
EMC and others valued at $30 billion over five to seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago it was an idea that bordered on heresy, to open
the doors to our technology to our competitors,'' IBM spokesman
Randy Thompson said. ``The mission is to get IBM technology into
the marketplace as quickly as possible.''

 &HT;    Tension at the fencing trials
 &HT;    By John Maher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ You won't need a knife, sabre, foil or epee to
cut the tension at the United States Olympic Fencing Trials in
Austin this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fencing is different from most other sports. We like to have
consistency. We have a series of Olympic trials,'' said Felicia
Zimmermann.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmermann and her younger sister Iris _ the Venus and Serena
Williams of fencing _ won't be in any cutthroat competition at the
convention center to make the Olympic squad. They, along with five
other fencers, already compose the U.S. Olympic team. The
Zimmermanns have done very well in international competitions, and
because U.S. fencers have scored better there, the importance of
the nationals for picking a team has lessened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still the nationals. I'd like to win,'' Felicia
Zimmermann said. ``But I just want to go in and have some fun. I'm
excited. I love Austin.''
</P>
<P>
   Iris, 19, and Felicia, 24, both fence in foil competition, which
is scheduled to start at 1 p.m. today. Also on the three-woman foil
team is Ann Marsh. According to Cindy Bent, a spokeswoman for the
United States Fencing Association, Erinn Smart already has enough
points to secure the alternate spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single one of us is strong. There's not one that's a
weak link. It's hard for anyone to figure us out, as we all have
different styles,'' Iris said.
</P>
<P>
   Women's foil, where the U.S. has a shot at winning a rare medal,
is the only U.S. fencing team that qualified for the Olympics.
Individuals that have earned a trip to Sydney to compete along with
the Zimmermann sisters are Keeth Smart and Ahki Spencer-El in men's
sabre, Cliff Bayer in men's foil, Arlene Stevens in women's epee
and Tamir Bloom in men's epee.
</P>
<P>
   Bayer is considered a medal threat, as is Iris Zimmermann. Last
year Iris became the first U.S. woman to capture a medal at the
World Championships when she tied for a bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Iris, however, will be sitting out the competition in Austin.
She's had knee problems for the past two years and is using this
time to get some rest and do some rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to watch my sister fence and cheer her on,'' Iris said.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters from upstate New York both attend Stanford but took
the year off to concentrate on the Olympics. Felicia is a little
more familiar with the Austin area. When the nationals were here
two years ago she got out to Antone's and some other spots. She
currently dates Sean McClain, a fencer from Round Rock who now
lives in the Rochester, N.Y., area.
</P>
<P>
   Felicia competed in the 1996 Olympics and is coming off an
encouraging finish in a World Cup event in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of my best results. It felt really good fencing,''
Felicia said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Iris, ``It will be really strange not to fence at
nationals, but I want to be there when they announce the Olympic
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Competition in the National Fencing Championships will conclude
Sunday.

BUSINESS EXCHANGE SITES RAISE QUESTIONS FOR REGULATORS

or 888-346-9867.) 
 By DAVID LEONHARDT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As companies in practically every industry rush to
join business-to-business exchanges on the Internet, regulators are
growing concerned that they will face a rash of new antitrust
questions for which they are not prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Known as B2B Web sites, the exchanges create a place for
companies in the same industry, be it automobiles or grain, to buy
and sell goods, potentially saving millions of dollars in
back-office costs by setting up a national marketplace online. But
the sites, which can compile huge amounts of sensitive data and are
often jointly owned by corporate rivals, also create opportunities
for collusion and price-fixing that did not exist before, antitrust
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Both regulators and executives agree that the stakes are
enormous. B2B sites already account for about $150 billion in
annual sales, significantly more than the better-known consumer
sites like Amazon.com. And that number is expected to grow
exponentially as businesses move more and more into buying and
selling to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antitrust has never had this kind of factual scenario to look
at before,'' said Susan DeSanti, the Federal Trade Commission's
director of policy planning.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the commission took the unusual step of holding a
two-day conference to which it invited executives, lawyers and
consumer advocates to advise it on how to regulate B2B
marketplaces. Already, the commission is examining Covisint, the
site planned by the nation's Big Three carmakers, and last month
the Department of Justice said it was investigating one led by six
large meatpacking companies. The Senate Commerce Committee also
plans to hold a hearing this month on the airline industry's joint
Web sites. And law firms are doing a brisk business in advising
business-to-business exchanges on how to organize themselves so as
to avoid regulatory scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials are beginning to take notice now because in
recent months one group of major companies after another has
announced plans to form exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, legal experts say B2B exchanges are likely to present
the next major forum _ after the Microsoft trial and the proposed
Worldcom-Sprint and America Online-Time Warner mergers _ for the
debate over how century-old antitrust laws should be applied to the
new world of the Internet. As in the previous cases, lawyers say,
the questions are not new: What is collusion and how can it be
stopped? When are competitors allowed to cooperate with each other?
Which rivals can they exclude from an alliance?
</P>
<P>
   The new twists are the speed with which companies are able to
communicate with one another and the the frequency with which
longtime rivals, such as DaimlerChrysler and General Motors and
Ford, are setting up joint ventures. Legal experts say those
ventures _ the B2B exchanges _ will give suppliers the opportunity
to signal each other about price increases, for instance, or
manufacturers a chance to conspire to pay artificially low prices
for their supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the issue that came up with Microsoft,'' said Andrew
I. Gavil, a professor at the Howard University School of Law. ``Is
antitrust up to dealing with technology?''
</P>
<P>
   Corporate executives, for their part, say the exchanges will
increase competition by giving companies access to the most
updated, accurate information about prices. That in turn will lower
businesses' costs, increasing profits for efficient companies and
eventually bringing lower prices to consumers, they add.
</P>
<P>
   For now, regulators say they are trying to learn as much as they
can about the B2B sites before issuing any far-reaching policies or
bringing suit against individual exchanges. ``We at the FTC are
very much in a learning phase,'' Sheila F. Anthony, a federal trade
commissioner, told executives and lawyers at last week's
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The promise of huge efficiencies is certainly tantalizing,''
Anthony added. ``On the other hand, I can't help but wonder if
there might be a serpent in the garden of efficiencies.''
</P>
<P>
   And Orson Swindle, another federal trade commissioner, said:
``We must get this right. Otherwise, we could do terrible harm.''
</P>
<P>
   The sites take any number of forms, from auctions that resemble
eBay to online catalogs that allow buyers to sift through products.
Some, like Covisint, are set up by the companies doing the buying.
Others, such as MetalSite, which is owned mainly by steel
manufacturers, are run by sellers.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, though, regulators' worries fall into two
general areas, DeSanti said. In shorthand, Gavil added, the issues
can be thought of as ``exclusion'' _ who is allowed to participate
in the exchanges, under what conditions _ and ``collusion'' _ what
the participants are able to do with the information they gather.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the regulators' concerns is how the rapid
exchange of information on the Web sites will affect the companies'
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In almost every sector of the economy, industry groups now spend
weeks collecting aggregated data on prices and sales volumes. On
the B2B exchanges, by contrast, companies will be able to see
current information immediately. That could make it easier for them
to coordinate the pricing of goods without ever speaking to each
other about it, a practice legal scholars call ``conscious
paralellism.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacking detailed, current information, a company might decide to
cut prices in a few markets and hope it can steal some market share
before a rival catches on, said Jonathan B. Baker, a former trade
commission official who teaches at the law school at American
University. On a business-to-business Web site, however,
information travels more quickly and could eliminate the price
wars.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The worry is more than than just hypothetical, antitrust experts
say. In 1992, the Justice Department sued the nation's large
airlines, accusing them of using their computer reservation systems
to send up trial balloons on price changes. Smaller airlines also
opposed the system, saying they lacked the money to buy computers
that had suddenly become necessary to compete.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the suit, the airlines agreed to stop publishing
information about future changes in fares.
</P>
<P>
   Though the legal proceedings surrounding it ended years ago, the
airline reservation system has become a frequent topic of
discussion among executives, corporate lawyers and government
officials today. The central questions it raised in the early '90s
about the ways a network can cause collusion and exclusion are the
same ones at the core of the new B2B debate, lawyers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fair analogy,'' said Mark L. Walsh, the chief executive
of VerticalNet, which owns 56 B2B marketplaces.
Business-to-business exchanges offer ``a similar potential for
abuse,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates also say that because so many of the
exchanges are owned by competitors, the Web sites will allow rivals
to make decisions jointly about production levels and inventories,
becoming de facto cartels in the mold of OPEC. ``These are serious,
structural issues,'' said Mark Cooper, the research director of the
Consumer Federation of America.
</P>
<P>
   To address the concerns _ and avoid regulatory run-ins _ the
companies setting up the exchanges are including antitrust lawyers
at almost every stage of the planning, executives say. The lawyer
for MetalSite has attended all of the company's board meetings, and
MetalSite executives avoid giving specific data to its board
members, who work for the steel companies that own the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably show our board less information than most boards
see. They only see aggregated data,'' said David B. Bordo, the
company's chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the exchanges is to convince their customers that
they are independent of the companies that founded them. Covisint,
for example, is now negotiating with the trade commission over the
terms of its formal separation from the car companies that created
it, said A. Alan Turfe, the General Motors executive who is the
exchange's interim co-chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The customers, meanwhile, are concerned that proprietary
information _ such as how much aluminum they are buying and at what
price _ will become available to rivals or clients.
</P>
<P>
   Francis P. Lopez, the chief executive of Aztec Manufacturing
Corp., an auto industry supplier in Romulus, Mich., said B2B Web
sites can cut costs and offer ``tremendous, tremendous
advantages.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are a lot of gray areas people are concerned
about,'' Lopez added. ``We have to make sure we have the ability to
protect privacy'' of companies' sensitive data.

OHIO ELECTION BECOMES A TEST CASE FOR NEW JUDICIAL POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Candidates for state Supreme Court here are
usually so unknown that contestants with familiar names have often
won because, political scientists say, voters thought they were
actually voting for someone they knew.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, at least two candidates for Ohio Supreme Court _
and quite possibly all seven members of the panel _ may soon be
wishing for those days of glorious obscurity. A boisterous,
multimillion-dollar election battle for one seat on the court is
making two candidates household names, while drawing uncomfortable
attention to all seven members of the rancorously divided court.
</P>
<P>
   The race is making Ohio a case study in the aggressive new
judicial politics that is reshaping courts and drawing
unprecedented spending to campaigns for state judgeships
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``People around the country are watching the Ohio judicial
race,'' said Seth S. Anderson, director of the Hunter Center for
Judicial Selection at the American Judicature Society, a
nonpartisan group. ``It typifies the intense involvement of
interest groups in judicial races that has been growing for the
last 15 years but that could reach its apex in Ohio this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Listeners to WSPD radio in Toledo have been hearing an unusual
advertisement that seems to put the entire Ohio Supreme Court on
trial. It was placed by the Michigan Chamber of Commerce to lure
Ohio businesses to the state, chamber officials said. ``The Ohio
Supreme Court,'' the commercial says, ``has rejected reasonable
legal reform'' by blocking efforts by the state Legislature to
limit liability suits against businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Some people here (Democrats) said the advertisement was an
example of plotting by Chamber of Commerce types against their
candidate, Justice Alice Robie Resnick, an incumbent abhorred by
business groups because she wrote the decision blocking the
liability measures.
</P>
<P>
   Other people (Republicans) said the advertisements were just a
reminder of why Ohio jobs would be saved by their candidate,
Terrence O'Donnell, a Cleveland appeals court judge who broadly
hints that he would have voted differently, saying he is against
``activist judges.''
</P>
<P>
   The president of the Michigan Chamber of Commerce, E. James
Barrett, denied being in league with anyone. But whatever their
true purpose, the advertisements were another reminder that
judicial races are beginning to provoke the same partisanship as
races for other offices always have.
</P>
<P>
   In a year when state Supreme Court campaigns across the country
are transforming judges more fully into politicians, Ohio is
leading the way, said Mark F. Kozlowski, a lawyer at the Brennan
Center for Justice at New York University Law School, which studies
judicial independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is success in defeating Resnick in Ohio, that could
very well become a model,'' Kozlowski said. ``Because there is an
extremely focused, specific campaign against her, and if they
defeat her that could become the textbook case.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the election is not until November, accusations have
been flying here for months. With predictions that spending on the
race could reach $12 million, the campaign is expected to be the
most expensive judicial race in Ohio and is likely to be one of the
most expensive in the country.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There is also a race under way for another seat on the court,
but the Republican incumbent, Deborah L. Cook, is favored over her
challenger, a Democratic Municipal Court judge, Timothy S. Black.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At stake in the Resnick-O'Donnell race is the ideological
balance of the court, which has been split 4-3 on many economic
issues, including so-called tort reform, which is how supporters
describe the efforts to reduce the number of lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   But, with many state courts around the country similarly
divided, the Ohio election has also drawn the attention of national
groups that view it as a test of strategies in battles over state
courts.
</P>
<P>
   By law here, each judicial campaign is limited to spending
$550,000. The balance of the spending is expected to be by unions,
lawyers, business groups and political parties, which are coming to
see the courts as a political forum like any other. Ohio imposes no
limits on the amount interest groups can spend.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, O'Donnell and Resnick expressed surprise at
finding themselves the objects of so much attention. O'Donnell
virtually squirmed during an interview in his chambers and talked
of earlier campaigns in which, he said, reputation and integrity
had been the only issues.
</P>
<P>
   Resnick seemed breathless from the intensity of the campaign.
``With these special interest groups,'' she said, ``people are
beginning to think judges are politicians, that seats can be bought
on courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, Resnick has inflamed Republican legislators
and business groups by writing majority opinions in two highly
publicized cases. The decisions struck down measures to limit suits
by people claiming injury and the state's system of financing
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   For many here, the rulings highlighted an ideological standoff
on the court, in which two Republicans have voted with the court's
two Democrats on some issues.
</P>
<P>
   In her opinion in the school case last month, Resnick seemed
outraged by what she said were the inequities of financing public
schools largely through property taxes. For the second time in
three years, the court ruled that the school financing system
controlled by the Republican governor and Legislature had deprived
students in poorer districts of the education guaranteed them. In
her opinion, Resnick dwelled on descriptions of sewage leaks in
Ohio schools.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have declared that a ``Resnick tax'' will be
necessary to pay for the public schools, and the state's Republican
chairman, Robert T. Bennett, created an acronym for the race _
DARTH _ for Defeat Alice Resnick Tax Hike.

</P>
<P>
   The three Republicans in the minority on the court, including
the court's chief justice, Thomas J. Moyer, have appeared to be
crying for rescue.
</P>
<P>
   At a political meeting in April, Moyer said O'Donnell shared his
philosophy of judicial restraint. Without mentioning Resnick,
according to The Toledo Blade, the chief justice added that ``when
a Supreme Court justice decides he or she is smarter than the
Legislature, what they are doing, in my view, is overruling the
will of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   An ethics panel of Ohio judges is considering complaints filed
against Moyer by a critic of the court and a county Democratic
Party chairman, who said he had violated rules intended to keep
judges outside the political fray. Moyer has said he did not make a
political endorsement, but acknowledged that he would not have
spoken so glowingly about O'Donnell if he had known reporters were
in the room.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell, 54, who often uses the word ``traditional'' to
describe himself, was chosen by Republican leaders to oppose
Resnick. A review of more than 50 of his decisions shows that he
has expressed a conservative view of the role of courts, but has
seldom made sweeping comments about legal issues.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit by the mother of a young man killed at a gay
nightclub, for example, O'Donnell tersely ruled that the club could
not be held liable for failing to provide adequate security because
its owners had no reason to expect a homicide. A Democratic judge,
Leo M. Spellacy, dissented, saying the dead man's family had a
right to a trial because the owners had failed to provide security
inside the club, even though it was in a high-crime neighborhood
and there had been previous violence.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, O'Donnell declined to characterize his
judicial philosophy and said he had also voted for plaintiffs in
some cases. Judges, he said, ``should not be for or against
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some of O'Donnell's critics here have said his emphasis on
opposing judicial activism is a coded way of saying he would vote
to overturn some of the decisions written by Resnick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not talking in code,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Resnick, who was first elected to the state's top court in 1988,
is no firebrand, either, though she has consistently ruled that
injured people have a right to have their claims heard in court.
Now 60, she patiently climbed the ranks of Democratic judicial
politics from the trial court after she first winning election in
Toledo in 1975. Earlier, as a prosecutor, she was a staunch death
penalty proponent, with 10 death sentences on her resume.
</P>
<P>
   On the state Supreme Court, Resnick has been neither
particularly famous nor liberal. She has enthusiastically agreed
with conservative criminal justice rulings. Once, in a case
involving a protester who had burned an American flag, she voted
against a decision that said the jury should have been told that
flag burning is protected by the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Resnick said she saw the current campaign as a battle of
fundamental values. Her opponents, she said in an interview, ``want
business to not have to worry about any negative decisions. To me,
the most serious thing going on in this country is what corporate
America is doing to working men and women.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The liability decision last summer made Resnick a political
target. For more than a decade, the Legislature had passed measures
limiting injury claims and the court had struck them down as
violations of the Ohio constitution's guarantees of the right to
access to the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1996, the Republicans who had gained control of the
Legislature passed many of those same laws again. In what legal
experts said was a rare challenge to a court's authority, the
legislators included provisions that simply said they
``respectfully disagree'' that the provisions violated the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
   In a 4-3 opinion, Resnick said the court had no choice but to
strike down the laws again. To do otherwise, she wrote, would make
the court ``a co-conspirator in the abdication of fundamental
individual rights and liberties contained in our Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision certainly got Resnick noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance, medical and other business groups began working
against her. She ``defied the will of the people'' as expressed by
the laws limiting injury claims, said Andrew E. Doehrel, the
president of the Ohio Chamber of Commerce, who said his members
were mobilized to defeat her.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision won Resnick support, too. Plaintiffs' lawyers,
consumer groups and unions are behind her. The Democratic Party
will spend ``whatever it takes'' to defend her, said David J.
Leland, the state chairman.
</P>
<P>
   In the quaint ways of the law, it was a procedural fluke that
landed Resnick in the position of writing two of the most visible
court decisions here in years. After the justices vote on cases,
the court selects which justice will write the opinions by lot,
drawing numbered marbles out of a leather jar.
</P>
<P>
   So, just as she was facing a re-election bid, it happened that
Resnick's number was drawn both for the liability and school cases.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman for the court here in Columbus, Jay Weubbold, said
the number on the marble assigned to Resnick is seven. It is not
yet clear whether it is her lucky number.

ARMENIAN LOSSES NOW INCLUDE THEIR LITERATURE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS HEDGES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TENAFLY, N.J. _ Hagup H. Asadourian communes with shadows. Some
are dark and frightening, like the shades of Turkish soldiers who
in 1915 herded him and his family from his Armenian village,
leaving him to watch his mother and four of his sisters die of
typhus in the Syrian desert.
</P>
<P>
   Some are sweet, revolving around the raucous Armenian-language
plays put on in the 1920s at the Yiddish Theater in New York City.
Some are poignant, like the reunion with his sister, the only
surviving member of his immediate family, 39 years after they lost
each other one night near the Dead Sea as they fled with a ragged
band of Armenian orphans from Syria to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   His battle to preserve memory, the theme of all his 14 books,
cannot save him from the destructive march of time. Time, to the
rapidly vanishing community of exiled Armenians, will soon finish
the work that, he says, was begun by the Turkish army 85 years ago.
Asadourian's latest book, ``The Smoldering Generation,'' is, he
said, ``about the inevitable loss of our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one takes the place of those who are gone,'' he said,
seated in front of a picture window that looked out on a carefully
groomed garden at his home here. ``Your children do not understand
you in this country. You cannot blame them.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, his son, who has used a wheelchair since he had a
stroke, jerked himself into position behind his father. He
listened, his head cocked slightly to one side, with a grimace.
</P>
<P>
   The death of more than 1 million Armenians in Turkey is often
cited as the opening act for the genocidal campaigns that convulsed
the 20th century. Although the Allied powers condemned the Turks
during World War I, there was no effort to hold them accountable
for actions against the Armenians after the dissolution of the
Ottoman Empire. The magnitude of the deaths and ultimate
indifference may have led Adolph Hitler, on the eve of the invasion
of Poland, to remind his followers, ``Who still speaks of the
extermination of the Armenians?''
</P>
<P>
   The Ottoman Turks, who feared a nationalist revolt like the one
that had convulsed the Balkans, spent six months in 1915 driving
most of the 2 million Armenians out of Turkey. In what Armenians
call genocide, at least a million were forced to march in pathetic
columns into the deserts of what are now Syria and Iraq, where
several hundred thousand were slaughtered or left to die of
starvation and disease. By 1923, Armenia says, 1.5 million were
dead and orphanages throughout the Middle East were flooded with
some 200,000 destitute Armenian children.
</P>
<P>
   The Turkish government still vigorously denies the event. It
says that some of the Armenians killed were rebels during World War
I and others were victims of the fighting and the widespread
famine. The Turks say they escorted Armenians away from the
fighting for their own safety. They concede that, because of the
war, some unfortunate incidents took place, but say that during
this time fewer than half a million Armenians died along with 2
million Turks.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the world of the Armenians, first mentioned by the
Greeks and Persians in 6 BC, has been reduced to dusty, forgotten
relics in present-day Turkey. Officially, the Republic of Armenia
has a population of about 3.4 million, but the poor economy, the
recent earthquake and the ethnic conflict that is continuing
between Azerbaijan and Armenia in Nagorno-Karabakh have caused at
least a third of the population to leave in the last decade,
Armenian scholars say.
</P>
<P>
   After World War I, about 25,000 Armenians came to the United
States. Some of their immigrant tales survive in small American
collections of Armenian literature and poetry, like the 15,000
volumes in the Zohrab Center in New York City. But these books lie
unread by all but a few scholars. Little of the work has been
translated.
</P>
<P>
   Zarmine Boghosian, the principal of the Holy Martyrs Armenian
Day School, said she, like most who speak Armenian, failed in her
effort to bring the literature to her children. Though she gives
her 100 elementary schoolchildren daily lessons in Armenian, she
concedes that as they go on in school the language is swiftly
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the sons of an Armenian school principal can no longer
grasp an Armenian work from the bookshelf and read it,'' she said,
``it means that we can no longer dream of maintaining this
literature.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss is not only literary, but severs Armenians from the
perspective of their parents and grandparents. Being Armenian, for
many, is little more than a label.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are losing our multigenerational thread,'' said Aris Sevag,
the managing editor of the English-language Armenian Reporter, a
weekly newspaper published in New York. ``We are losing our ability
to understand the Armenian gestalt, our inner world.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as the Armenian language disappears, American scholars
have been turning their attention to Armenian history. Peter
Balakian, a professor of English at Colgate University, said that
in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the rising awareness of human
rights brought more attention to the Armenian diaspora.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Armenian genocide is perhaps the hottest discourse in the
genocide studies arena and is being taught nationwide in high
schools and universities,'' said Balakian, who is of Armenian
descent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans, who once used the phrase `the starving Armenians'
in daily speech for decades in the earlier part of the century, are
now relearning this history,'' he continued. ``I believe that this
time the history of the Armenian genocide is here to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Armenians have found that the present is something in which the
dead hold no shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother came from Bursa, a town in western Turkey,''
said Aram Arkun, a historian. ``A man from her town meticulously
compiled a manuscript with pictures, sketches and writings on the
town's customs, traditions, notable families and history. This was
common. A couple hundred of these local histories were published;
perhaps hundreds more were not. I found the daughters of this man.
They had thrown the book, which they could not read, in the trash
after his death. Now a little piece of our history and our culture
is gone forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The decimation of their universe further impoverishes cultural
studies, scholars say, as Western culture relied on Armenian monks
to rescue works by such ancient Greek writers as Philo and Eusebius
from oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You lose expressions used in households, terms of endearment
and intellectual concepts,'' said the Rev. Krikor Maksoudian, who
once taught Armenian history and literature at Columbia University.
``Each language has its own way of describing and asserting human
experience. Each contains the temper of the tradition itself. None
of this can be captured fully in translation. We are losing another
perspective on the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there were once 10 major Armenian-language daily
newspapers in the United States, there is just one left, published
in California. Armenian clubs have closed, social societies have
been disbanded and cultural events have dwindled. Proceedings of
Armenian meetings, when they take place, are usually in English
(except at church affairs, where Armenian clergy nearly always
speak in Armenian first, then English).
</P>
<P>
   Asadourian, 97, said he had accepted that his writing would not
halt the slide to obliteration. (His two sons were raised speaking
Armenian; his granddaughter speaks it, but does not write very
well.) Rather, he writes to give a voice to the 331 people with
whom he trudged into Syria in September 1915. Only 29 of those
people survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never really write what happened anyway,'' Asadourian
said. ``It is too ghoulish. I still fight with myself to remember
it as it was. You write because you have to. It all wells up inside
of you. It is like a hole that fills constantly with water and no
amount of bailing will empty it. This is why I continue.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   There are American memoir writers, like Michael J. Arlen
(``Passage to Ararat'') and Peter Balakian (``Black Dog of Fate''),
who struggle with the meaning of the genocide for the children of
survivors. Their works, written in English, are a step away from
the works of their forefathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put the Armenian experience into therapeutic form,'' said
Chris Zakian, a book editor of Armenian descent. ``These memoirs
get the experience out of us. But then what happens? It is another
act on the road to assimilation. It helps us unload the onerous
bits about being Armenian. There is no continuation of a
tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Asadourian, who recently translated his granddaughters' poems
into Armenian, has begun to donate his papers to a library in what
was once Soviet Armenia. He is sending them there because, although
the historical experience, dialect and written script are
different, ``at least they still speak Armenian.''
</P>
<P>
   His passion, however, burns deep. He refused to halt the painful
story of his deportation despite having to reach for a bottle of
pills wrapped with a piece of white gauze. He took a deep breath
before plunging into the last bit of detail, one he had left out of
the lengthy chronology.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it came time to bury my mother, I had to get two other
small boys to help me carry her body up to a well where they were
dumping the corpses,'' he said. ``We did this so the jackals would
not eat them. The stench was terrible. There were swarms of black
flies buzzing over the opening. We pushed her in feet first, and
the other boys, to escape the smell, ran down the hill. I stayed. I
had to watch. I saw her head, as she fell, bang on one side of the
well and then the other before she disappeared. At the time, I did
not feel anything at all.''
</P>
<P>
   He stopped, visibly shaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of a son is that?'' he asked hoarsely.
</P>
<P>
   The house fell silent. Asadourian's son, as motionless as his
father during the story, flipped the electric switch on his chair
and rolled out of the room.

   NEW YORK _ The families fill the courtrooms and hallways of this
city's courthouses each day, a stream of human traffic driven by
surging arrest rates and crowded court calendars.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases they arrive in force: parents, siblings and
children determined to show support for a loved one with their
sheer numbers. But in most cases they are women who arrive alone or
with young children they cannot leave at home: a solitary mother,
wife or girlfriend intent on supporting a scorned defendant, or
serving as a poignant reminder of a murder victim.
</P>
<P>
   They are the families of the accused and the victims, and they
are all in some form of mourning. They often display remarkable
grace and loyalty, and say their experiences in the grim
courthouses can be cathartic.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of families are those that have long been seen in the
criminal courts _ the poor. But defense lawyers say that they have
seen a different type of family arrive in recent years as the
city's quality-of-life crackdown continues. More working-class
families who have never before had brushes with the law arrive in
shock after a loved one is arrested and jailed overnight for a
minor offense, like driving with a suspended license.
</P>
<P>
   But despite high divorce rates and the far-flung nature of
modern families, one longstanding legal truism endures: the concept
of family remains a potent weapon in court. The presence of family
members often has an impact, great or small, on the outcome of the
trial or arraignment they have come to see.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with judges, jurors, prosecutors and defense lawyers
suggest that the presence of these families _ some tattered, some
durably faithful _ can be a critical factor in the balance of
justice.
</P>
<P>
   A frantic wife or a grieving mother staring intently at a judge
or jury can humanize a defendant or a murder victim, they said. And
the lack of any family members in the audience _ a situation that
roughly half of defendants face _ can sully the accused.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important for juries,'' said Acting Justice John P.
Walsh of State Supreme Court, a former police inspector who
supervises the city's arraignment courts. ``It shows that a
defendant's family hasn't abandoned them. Psychologically for
jurors, if it's a close case, it will have an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Judges said that jurors sometimes do not realize the subtle
emotional impact families have on them by sitting in a courtroom.
Jurors also may disregard instructions to pay no attention to the
audience, the judges said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Jurors in the first trial of Andrew Goldstein, a schizophrenic
man convicted in March of murdering Kendra Webdale by pushing her
in front of a subway, were instructed to draw no inference from the
failure of Goldstein's family to testify in his defense or to
attend his trial.
</P>
<P>
   But several jurors said they found the absence of Goldstein's
family suspicious. And after Goldstein's first trial ended in a
hung jury last November, jurors apologized to members of Webdale's
family and hugged them in front of the courthouse. Jurors said they
owed it to the Webdale family to have reached a verdict. They said
they had noticed the victim's relatives sitting resolutely in the
courtroom each day.
</P>
<P>
   But the human tales that play out in the courtrooms and the
crowded, often loud, sometimes menacing hallways of the courthouses
typically do not receive much notice. The families come intent on
doing the right thing and on perhaps gaining an edge in the pending
legal fight, but anything can happen.

<P>
   David Kapner, a defense lawyer who supervises arraignments for
the Legal Aid Society in Manhattan, said the city's quality-of-life
crackdown had brought a different type of family to the city's
criminal courthouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality-of-life arrests suck up a lot of people who have
never been in trouble before, and those are the people who are more
likely to have their families show up in court,'' he said. ``There
are more teen-agers for drinking beer, or immigrants for
peddling.''

<P>
   One morning last month in the Manhattan Criminal Courts Building
was typical of a justice system in which a thousand people a day
are arrested and thousands of cases are handled every week.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa Cabrera, 49, wept as she, her husband, her two daughters,
her daughter-in-law and her nephew walked into the lobby
desperately searching for her son, who had been arrested by
immigration officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would get run over by a bus or a train if that would make
them let him go,'' said Cabrera, who sobbed and said she was afraid
her son would be deported.
</P>
<P>
   Down the hall, Blanca Santiago, 18, sat on the floor waiting
with her father-in-law for her husband to be released. The Mexican
immigrant had been arrested and accused of selling flowers without
a permit. A few feet away, a Chinese man tried to comfort his two
children as he and his sister-in-law tried to find out when his
wife would be released after being arrested on a charge of buying
untaxed cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Cabrera and Santiago were hardly alone in their wait for the
release of husbands, boyfriends and sons who had been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Anguished conversations on the bank of pay phones that line the
lobby wall are common. Family members break the news that someone
has been arrested, try to hire a lawyer or struggle to raise bail
money.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Most of the women are financially dependent on the men, defense
lawyers said. Mothers who say they have no place to leave their
children take them to the courthouse. At night, strollers and
crying infants are common sights and sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say, `I'm looking for my baby's father,''' said Sgt.
Stephen Crisafulli, a court officer who supervises the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Mothers who struggle to keep the children quiet in courtrooms
often retreat to the hallways. There, the children play impromptu
games, sitting on the floor or running in circles and shrieking as
their mothers wait.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Wednesday night, Angela Medina, 18, gave her
one-month-old son a bottle as she sat in the lobby waiting for her
sister's boyfriend to be released. ``I want to support him and my
sister,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other cases sometimes draw immigrant families who arrive in
force. During one night court shift, 12 relatives of a woman from
Senegal who was arrested in a domestic dispute arrived at 1 a.m. to
find her. The group included her 2-month-old niece.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents and spouses accept defendants' claims that they
were victims of false arrests by officers overzealously enforcing
the city's quality-of-life crackdown. But others fly into a rage at
their loved one.
</P>
<P>
   The most heated confrontation in the Manhattan Criminal Courts
Building in the last several years was between a father and son,
Crisafulli said. The father, who had spent time in prison, flew
into a rage after his own son was arrested. ```How could you do
this! I work every day for you!'' the father thundered as court
officers restrained him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really ripping the boy to keep him from going down the
same path,'' the sergeant said. ``It was fear and frustration, not
anger.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Judges said that in less serious cases, defendants' ties to
their families are factors in how much bail they set or whether
they offer plea bargains involving probation or drug rehabilitation
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's got a mother, brother, sister and wife sitting in the
audience, it shows he has a support system,'' Walsh said. ``That
support system is important for him to take his medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   But defense lawyers said that the presence of families can also
complicate matters. Some young defendants will refuse to plead
guilty in front of their mothers, for example, if they have sworn
to their parents they did not do the crimes. Other family members
give terrible legal advice, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   While the building's ground floor is filled with families
usually suffering smaller heartaches, its upper floors are lined
with families enduring far larger ones. There, defendants face more
serious felony charges, most involving drugs, that can result in
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Racial and class tensions can also hover over the courtrooms.
Poor families frequently complain that their loved ones receive
longer sentences because they cannot afford ``a real lawyer,'' and
that fury finds expression in the court buildings. After a drug
addict who killed a man with his car while on PCP was sentenced to
15 years in prison last month, one of his relatives shouted ``let
it be a Mercedes-Benz, and you'll walk away no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many family members seem to fall into stereotypical roles in the
courthouse, judges and lawyers said. Mothers generally attend
trials religiously and are better able to express their emotions,
they said. Fathers, by contrast, appear intermittently and seem to
struggle with their anger.
</P>
<P>
   Many relatives on the building's upper floors are hoping to
influence judges or to simply catch a glimpse of a jailed defendant
during a brief court appearance.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the mother, two aunts, girlfriend and three cousins
of Victor Rhymer, 19, waited hours for him to be sentenced for
robbing a man of his beeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a strain to come here because we love him,'' his aunt
Claudette said.
</P>
<P>
   Courthouse veterans said that explaining the continuing power of
families in the court system is simple. Jurors and judges, like all
people, may groan about their own nagging mothers, distant fathers
and crazy siblings. But blood is still expected to bind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is that if you're alone in this world,
it's much harder to rehabilitate yourself,'' said David Kapner, a
defense lawyer with the Legal Aid Society. ``But if you have some
people in your life, you have a better chance of pulling yourself
together. Intuitively, judges and juries understand that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers and judges say one of the most depressing sights
in court is the roughly 50 percent of defendants who arrive alone,
with no family members. Many are long-term drug abusers whose
addictions have shattered their ties to their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them are acquitted and they walk out of the courtroom
and there is no one there,'' said David Stern, a Manhattan defense
lawyer. ``Some are convicted and no one sheds a tear.''

HOUSTON SCHOOLS SUE MAKERS OF LEAD PAINT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BILL MURPHY 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the cost of removing or treating lead paint in their
schools expected to cost millions, two Houston school districts are
suing the major companies that made lead paint.
</P>
<P>
   The suits, filed separately last week, are the first brought by
school districts nationwide, but are similar to pending ones by the
city of St. Louis, the state of Rhode Island and a California
county.
</P>
<P>
   The paint makers have defeated all such suits in the past. A
victory here or elsewhere could set a precedent and encourage other
cities and school districts to sue, lawyers say.
</P>
<P>
   The suits hope to mimic the success of those against tobacco
makers in the past few years and asbestos makers in the late 1980s
and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Houston and Spring Branch school districts argue
that the companies are responsible for the lead paint even if it
was put on walls 30 or 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have applied somebody's product and it has to be removed
at exorbitant cost, we don't feel the taxpayers should have to pay
for the removal,'' Spring Branch Superintendent Hal Guthrie said.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the paint makers say they stopped putting lead in
interior paints in the 1950s and shouldn't be held responsible for
lead paint applied long before it was known to be unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've disseminated information and worked with public health
officials to make changes,'' said Alan Wheat, spokesman for a
number of companies being sued.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hardy, a lawyer for one of the companies, NL Industries,
said, ``I don't think manufacturers should be responsible for
products forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The Houston suits are against DuPont, Glidden, Sherwin-Williams,
Atlantic Richfield, the Lead Industries Association, a trade group,
and several other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers reduced the lead in interior paints to under 1
percent in 1955, but continued to make lead paint for exteriors
until 1978, when the federal government banned it.
</P>
<P>
   The local suits contend that the manufacturers knew lead paint
was dangerous, especially to children, long before 1955.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lead-paint industry knew as early as the 1900s that this
product could cause severe harm to people,'' the suits say. ``By
the 1930s and 1940s, the industry was fully aware of the harm.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rhode Island suit filed last fall said industry memos show
that paint makers knew of lead paint's dangers in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   The districts are using the same law firms, Bracewell &AMP;
Patterson and Fleming &AMP; Associates, to bring virtually identical
suits.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat, a former Missouri congressman, said paint makers helped
pay for studies in the 1940s and 1950s at Johns Hopkins and Harvard
universities that revealed lead paint's dangers and helped make the
findings known.
</P>
<P>
   Lead exposure can cause permanent brain, nervous system and
kidney damage in children, especially those under 4.
</P>
<P>
   Cases of lead poisoning have dropped dramatically since lead
paint was banned in 1978, but lead poisoning remains a national
problem.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, more than 7,400 children under age 7 had high lead
levels out of 53,000 screened since 1992, said Kathy Barton,
spokesman for the city Health and Human Services Department. The
children screened were mostly from inner-city neighborhoods where
most of the homes were built before 1960.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA now views lead paint removal or treatment as a priority,
said Ronald Scott, a lawyer representing the Houston and Spring
Branch districts.
</P>
<P>
   Guthrie said Spring Branch sued because it is concerned that the
EPA will order districts to undertake expensive lead treatment
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty of our 37 campuses were built before 1980,'' Guthrie
said. ``We're talking about millions (of dollars).''
</P>
<P>
   In HISD, 213 out of 300 schools were built before 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The local suits are seeking money only to treat lead in schools.
St. Louis, Rhode Island and Santa Clara County in the San Jose,
Calif.,area are looking to recover money spent on treating lead
poisoning victims.
</P>
<P>
   Those costs include medical treatment and special ed classes and
lead treatment programs in homes.
</P>
<P>
   Suits against paint makers never have been successful.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia filed a class action suit on behalf of all cities
in the early 1990s, but it was dismissed because the statute of
limitations in Pennsylvania had long passed, said Hardy.
</P>
<P>
   Other suits have been been dismissed because the plaintiffs
couldn't identify which companies sold the paint needing removal.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia and other plaintiffs based their cases on a theory
called market-share liability, Hardy said.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is that a huge paint maker should be found liable for
a certain percentage of damages based on past share of the lead
paint market. However, Hardy says, courts in many states have
rejected the theory because it could penalize companies not liable
for a particular problem.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, lawyer for the Houston and Spring Branch districts, said
it is unlikely he will bring a market-share case.
</P>
<P>
   He also said there is no statute of limitations on negligence
suits by schools and other government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Houston and Spring Branch officials said the suits don't mean
children in their school districts are at risk of getting lead
poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   Most lead paint has been painted over. It becomes a health
hazard only when a non-lead coat wears away, and lead paint falls
in chips or dust form, said the city's Barton.

 &HT;    Ramseys downsizing to pay debts, lawyer says
 &HT;    By Craig Schneider
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ John and Patsy Ramsey are gearing down their lavish
lifestyle to pay off legal debts, selling their $700,000 Atlanta
home and living in a rented apartment here, their attorney said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they're on skid row, but this represents a
drastically different lifestyle,'' Atlanta lawyer Lin Wood said.
``They are in a lot of debt, and it's costing them their home in
Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood did not disclose the Ramseys' level of debt or how much
they would be asking for the house purchased in 1997 on Paces Ferry
Road in northwest Atlanta. ``I can only tell you that their legal
fees and expenses were massive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys plan on remaining in Atlanta, where their son,
Burke, attends a private school and where both John and Patsy have
relatives, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wood also confirmed that the Ramseys have bought a
1,300-square-foot vacation home in the northern Michigan resort
town of Charlevoix,where they had a larger vacation home when their
daughter JonBenet was killed.
</P>
<P>
   But he stressed that the new house is ``very modest'' with three
bedrooms and one bath. The house requires some remodeling, which he
said John Ramsey plans to do himself.

 &HT;    FedEx delivering new Potter book tomorrow
 &HT;    By Dave Hirschman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FedEx Corp. is conjuring supernatural forces in its battle with
United Parcel Service for residential deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   The Memphis-based transportation company will deliver 250,000
copies Saturday of ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,'' the
fourth in a wildly popular series by J.K. Rowling about the
adventures of a magical orphan.
</P>
<P>
   The high-profile shipments are designed to showcase FedEx Home
Delivery _ a new service that FedEx is expanding to cover virtually
all U.S. households within 20 months.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, FedEx picked up thousands of Harry Potter books
from an Amazon.com warehouse in Henry County and began transporting
them to eager readers around the country. More than 300,000 have
been ordered via the Web site, and the publisher has printed 5.3
million so far.
</P>
<P>
   As part of an Amazon.com promotion, the first 250,000 buyers at
the site got free FedEx Saturday delivery. The two companies aren't
disclosing the financial terms of their deal, but for FedEx the
payoff is being associated with the Harry Potter craze.
</P>
<P>
   ``This project underscores our ability to handle a large number
of residential shipments with military precision,'' said Rodger
Marticke, executive vice president at FedEx Ground, a subsidiary
that includes the Home Delivery unit. ``It also draws attention to
the fact we deliver on Saturdays as a normal course of business.''
</P>
<P>
   FedEx Home Delivery will do about 50,000 book deliveries. FedEx
Express, the company's core next-morning delivery service, will
deliver 200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at UPS, which handles more than 13 million packages
daily, said they could have accommodated the one-day surge in Harry
Potter shipments but didn't seek the contract because they saw no
reason to offer steep, promotional discounts.
</P>
<P>
   UPS is the dominant delivery firm for the publishing industry,
and company spokeswoman Susan Rosenberg said adolescent sorcerer
Harry Potter won't dislodge it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the primary shipper for Amazon, and we're the market
leader for shipping on behalf of the dot-com companies,'' Rosenberg
said. ``Amazon asked us if we were interested (in the Potter
promotion), and we decided it was something we didn't want to
pursue.''

 &HT;    UPS takes on role of credit intermediary
 &HT;    By Dave Hirschman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an effort to expand small package shipments generated online,
United Parcel Service's financial arm has begun offering credit
cards and lines of credit to businesses that buy products on
AmericasMart.com, the Atlanta-based companies announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Bernabucci, president of UPS Capital Corp., said the
agreement is the first of many that will attempt to bridge the
online gaps between manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers. UPS
will pay manufacturers and wholesalers for their products as soon
as they are ordered, deliver them to retailers and collect
payments.
</P>
<P>
   The system is designed to eliminate the need for sellers to
extend credit or send packages C.O.D. It is not intended for
individual consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're investigating a number of opportunities in
business-to-business cards,'' Bernabucci said. ``We're looking at
offering similar programs for a variety of distinct networks.''
</P>
<P>
   UPS officials say their new product benefits Internet buyers and
sellers alike. Sellers will collect payments right away and won't
owe fees to credit card companies. Buyers will get reduced interest
rates and discounts on future purchases.
</P>
<P>
   UPS says it can afford to reduce interest rates and eliminate
fees because it already has relationships with more than 80 percent
of AmericasMart.com's clients. Also, each transaction creates
additional shipments for UPS' core transportation business.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Farrugia, chief executive at AmericasMart.com, said the
UPS agreement will make it easier for large and small companies to
close deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of manufacturers will only do business with buyers
that have established lines of credit,'' he said. ``Now, small
businesses will have access to those lines of credit through UPS.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrugia expects UPS credit cards to increase the volume of
business on AmericasMart.com, but he isn't sure how much. The
company, owned by AMC Inc., which is the sponsor of AmericasMart
Atlanta and its 17 annual trade shows, began trading on its Web
site Monday.

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in
New York City. Running times and ratings of films are in
parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `THE ADVENTURES OF ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE,' starring Rene Russo,
Jason Alexander and Robert De Niro, with the voices of June Foray
and Keith Scott. Directed by Des McAnuff (PG, 88 minutes). Fans of
Jay Ward's old ``Rocky and Bullwinkle'' television show will enjoy
the first 10 minutes or so of this new movie, which employs the
show's characteristically flat animation and goofy humor to update
the biographies of the beloved flying squirrel, his antlered
sidekick and their enemies Boris, Natasha and Fearless Leader. But
the antic whimsy of the cartoon original is betrayed as the film
turns into a clunky, muddled stew of special effects, lame jokes
and labored attempts at satire. Rocky, Bullwinkle and a young FBI
agent save the world from Fearless Leader (De Niro), but who will
save it from misguided, overpriced and overhyped movies? (A.O.
Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `BUTTERFLY,' starring Fernando Fernan Gomez and Manuel Lozano.
Directed by Jose Luis Cuerda (R, 96 minutes). This gentle,
devastating new film, based on short stories by the Spanish writer
Manuel Rivas, tells the story of Moncho (Lozano), a sensitive young
boy coming of age in the months before the outbreak of the Spanish
Civil War. The movie touches on the usual excitements and mysteries
of childhood, but Moncho's relationship with his teacher, the
proudly Republican Don Gregorio, beautifully played by Fernan
Gomez, gives the story an unusual degree of pathos and political
complexity (Scott).

<P>
   `CHICKEN RUN,' with the voices of Mel Gibson, Miranda Richardson
and Julia Sawalha. Directed by Peter Lord and Nick Park (G, 86
minutes). The first full-length feature from Aardman Animation is
immensely satisfying, a divinely relaxed and confident film that
credits youngsters' interest in a cartoon more substantial than the
standard bland musical. The movie employs modeled latex figures to
tell the story of a group of chickens desperate to escape from a
chicken farm before they are turned into pies. Nick Park, who also
directed the fabulous Wallace and Gromit shorts, transfers all of
the deftness and imagination of his shorter films into an artful
big-screen realization. And this briskly paced epic uses Lord's
continuing satirical take on British modesty and balmy superiority.
``Chicken Run'' parodies cultural touchstones from ``Stalag 17'' to
``Star Trek'' to the loose-cannon heroics of Gibson, the voice of
Rocky, the matinee-idol flying rooster who is asked to teach the
hens to fly. Finally, it shows that the hens can save themselves
through the pluck of Ginger (Sawalha) and doesn't make a big deal
of this (Elvis Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `DINOSAUR,' with the voices of D.B. Sweeney, Alfre Woodard and
Ossie Davis. Directed by Ralph Zondag and Eric Leighton (PG, 90
minutes). Reputedly the most expensive animated feature ever made,
Disney's showcase of computer animation technology begins with a
breathtaking sequence, a visual and sonic extravaganza that the
rest of the movie never quite lives up to. The story, of a young
dinosaur raised by lemurs who must lead a herd of his fellow
reptiles to safety after an asteroid strikes the earth, is cobbled
from other Disney plots. But the effects _ the dinosaur's movements
and their nearly seamless insertion into real locations _ will
impress skeptical grown-ups. (The movie reportedly cost about $200
million.) Despite some potentially upsetting scenes of carnivorous
mayhem, the film will delight children (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `GETTING TO KNOW YOU,' starring Bebe Neuwirth, Heather Matarazzo
and Mark Weston. Directed by Lisanne Skyler (unrated, 91 minutes).
Adapting material by Joyce Carol Oates, Skyler conjures an alluring
tale of mistrust and hope by getting to the themes of
self-deception and betrayal that Oates characters often weave for
themselves. Stranded at a bus station, Judith (Matarazzo) and Jimmy
(Weston) spin tales about the people they see there and reveal
things about each other through their extemporaneous fictions.
Skyler gets standout performances, and her patience and skill are
revealed in small, satisfying ways throughout the film (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `GLADIATOR,' starring Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie
Nielsen, Richard Harris and Oliver Reed. Directed by Ridley Scott
(R, 150 minutes). This movie is the answer to a question no one
bothered to ask: What would happen if someone decided to film the
imminent extreme football league as if it were a Chanel commercial?
Scott subjects action-packed bouts of mayhem and decapitation in
the Roman Colosseum to his glossy, inhuman directing style; it is
admirable but repellent. As the noble Roman general who ends up
fighting for his life, Crowe gives a performance with ball-of-fire
intensity suffused with a movie star's impatience. He holds the
movie together, such as it is (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `GONE IN 60 SECONDS,' starring Nicolas Cage, Giovanni Ribisi,
Angelina Jolie and Robert Duvall. Directed by Dominic Sena (PG-13,
119 minutes). A remake of a movie so insubstantial that its title
seems to refer to the length of time it would linger in memory.
Cage, who has gone prematurely blond, is the world's best car
thief, who is dragged out of his apparently lucrative go-cart
business and returns to auto theft to save the life of his brother
(Ribisi). With a magnetic cast of crooks and cops, it's mindless
hot-rodding entertainment for those who love car chases with
vintage autos, a film so glossy and impersonal that you will
sympathize more with the cars than the people (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `GROOVE,' starring Hamish Linklater, Lola Glaudini, Mackenzie
Firgens and Steve Van Wormer. Directed by Greg Harrison (R, 86
minutes). If you're nostalgic for chasing down a rave gig across
the city and arriving to find a pair of 16-year-olds discussing the
merits of drum and bass versus jungle, then this mostly knowing and
funny comedy is just the film for you. Even if you're not, its
seductive lack of pretension will win you over. ``Groove'' is a
comedy of moments, tracking a crowd through the ups and downs of
one night of pleasure at a rave. Harrison and his team do not try
to pretend that raves are anything new or dangerous. Rather,
they're an entrenched circuit with specific tribal complications,
and this genial picture captures them (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `ME, MYSELF AND IRENE,' starring Jim Carrey and Renee Zellweger.
Directed by Bobby Farrelly and Peter Farrelly (R, 100 minutes). If
``There's Something About Mary'' offended you with its callous
mockery of hair and pet care and its whimsical views of stalking
and serial killing, then this latest festival of vulgarity from the
Farrelly brothers will make you miserable. But ``Me, Myself and
Irene'' shares with their earlier movies a kind of dopey, boyish
sincerity and a good-natured sympathy for the underdog that may
prove capable of winning over even the dourest spirits. Carrey, in
one _ or is it two? _ of his most charming and repellent
performances, plays a Rhode Island state trooper with a split
personality and a giant crush on Irene, played with winning moxie
and plausible bewilderment by Zellweger (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `THE PATRIOT,' starring Mel Gibson. Directed by Roland Emmerich
(R, 158 minutes). A grueling Revolutionary War epic that, at more
than two and a half hours, seems to take place in real time. The
brutality and sentimentality are effective, though the film will
leave you feeling used as you exit the theater. This sort-of
prequel to Emmerich's ``Independence Day'' stars Gibson as a gentle
farmer who leads the Colonies in wresting freedom from the Brits,
using counterintuitive methods alarmingly similar to terrorism. His
anguished masculinity is brandished like a musket. The film's chief
asset is his relationship with the young actors playing his
children; it draws on the actor's real-life feeling about his own
large brood, and his work with them is stirring (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `THE PERFECT STORM,' starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and
Diane Lane. Directed by Wolfgang Petersen (PG-13, 150 minutes.)
Impressive but monotonously redundant special effects smother the
human drama in this true story (adapted from Sebastian Junger's
best-selling book) of a group of swordfishermen battling ``the
storm of the century'' off Massachusetts in 1991. Clooney is the
ship's glowering, enigmatic captain, and Wahlberg and Lane are the
appealing lovebirds who lend the movie its stingy quotient of
warmth. The early scenes, which paint a romantic portrait of the
fisherman's life in Gloucester, Mass., promise a great deal, but
the movie becomes waterlogged once it leaves shore (Stephen
Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `PRAISE,' starring Peter Fenton and Sacha Horler. Directed by
John Curran (unrated, 98 minutes). A stunner about a doomed
relationship that's like Tennessee Williams with the ragged
heedlessness of post punk. Gordon (Fenton) is the epitome of
slacker, a slender do-nothing whose passivity is part of his wasted
charm. He attracts the sexually voracious Cynthia (Horler), whose
soft body is wracked with eczema. Though the movie feels aimless,
Curran lets the explicit detail spell out the compulsiveness of the
characters and uses jolts of humor to keep the squalor from lapsing
into unrelieved unpleasantness. Horler's tender and fearless
performance is just one of the elements that wiil stick with you
(Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `SHAFT,' starring Samuel L. Jackson, Vanessa Williams, Jeffrey
Wright, Christian Bale, Toni Collette and Richard Roundtree. A
sequel/remake to the 1971 semi-classic, starring the always
dependable Jackson. He's the nephew of the original Shaft
(Roundtree, who appears briefly), and this time, Shaft is a cop. He
leaves the force to track down a racist WASP murderer (Bale), who
joins forces with a drug dealer (the flamboyant and skillful
Wright) to eliminate the hero. This may be the least politically
correct movie in some time, and though it tries to convert
archetype into stereotype, it doesn't succeed. Watching the two
villains squabble for center stage is like watching Luciano
Pavarotti and Placido Domingo in a death match for the mike. But
Jackson comes out on top of this emptily entertaining hodgepodge of
retro and modern cliches (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `SUNSHINE,' starring Ralph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz, Jennifer Ehle,
Rosemary Harris and James Frian. Directed by Istvan Szabo (R, 180
minutes). In Szabo's tale of 20th-century Hungarian history,
Fiennes plays three members of a wealthy Jewish Budapest family _
grandfather, father and son _ who endure the corruption of the
Austro-Hungarian empire, the viciousness of fascism and the
brutality of communism. Fiennes' performances, and those of Ehle
and Harris (playing the same character at different stages of life)
help save the film from melodramatic excess. Even though much of
the story is crudely told, ``Sunshine'' is a serious, humane and
thought-provoking attempt to make sense of complicated and painful
historical experiences (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `TRIXIE,' starring Emily Watson and Nick Nolte. Directed by Alan
Rudolph (R, 117 minutes). In the self-billed ``screwball film
noir,'' Watson plays an undercover detective at a lakeside casino
investigating the murder of a third-rate lounge singer. Nolte is
the alcoholic, womanizing politician she suspects of the murder.
The director is wonderful with actors, and the fine supporting
cast, which includes Lesley Ann Warren, Will Patton and Nathan
Lane, fills in the movie's sleazy atmosphere. But the story neither
connects its narrative dots nor generates suspense, and the humor
(the title character is given to silly malapropisms) falls flat
(Holden).

 &HT;    EDITORIAL _ Be open to new Mexican leader's ideas
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vicente Fox's smashing election victory is splendid news for
Mexico politically, transfering the reins of government peacefully
there after 71 years of one-party domination. His presidency, which
won't start until December, could also be the start of something
good for Mexicans economically, with repercussions that could be
detectable in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of Fox's center-right agenda is raising living
standards for Mexico's 100 million people, 30 million of whom live
in extreme poverty. Fox has set ambitious goals for raising
education standards and for creating better-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But that will take time and resources, a crucial part of which
he hopes to secure by making Mexico more attractive to investors
from the United States, Canada and elsewhere. Strong selling points
in that effort will be his promised crackdown on corruption and his
commitment to build on the North American Free Trade Agreement,
which has increased trade between the United States and Mexico from
$80 billion to $200 billion in six years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for the foreseeable future, many Mexicans will have to
look northward for work and for wages to sustain their families. In
yet-to-be-scheduled meetings with President Clinton and the two
major candidates to succeed him, George W. Bush and Al Gore, Fox is
sure to ask for a more generous, better regulated U.S. approach to
migrant labor, and they should hear him out.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond considering another amnesty for undocumented Mexicans
living above the border, U.S. officials should give serious thought
to raising the limit on permanent working permits to Mexicans, now
running at 65,000 a year, and negotiating broader guest-worker
agreements, both seasonal and sectoral.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of more systemized procedures ought to work both
ways. Employers should get a surer supply of labor at predictable
costs. Migrant workers are certain to prefer traveling northward
openly and safely for jobs of pre-set durations and wages to the
high-risk quests for work they undertake now.
</P>
<P>
   And how does Georgia fit in all this? A host of industries in
our full-employment state would have broken down without the influx
of Mexican and other Latino workers over the last 15 years. The
sooner the undocumented in that population have legal working
papers and can be here without fear of exposure or exploitation,
the better for all concerned.

SPORTS COLUMN: SISTERS FACE THE MOMENT OF TRUTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TEN-WIMBLEDON, TEN-WIMBLEDON-NOTES) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Venus Williams was drenched with sweat. Her
signature braids, her one-piece tennis outfit, all dripping with
the effort of a grueling semifinal victory.
</P>
<P>
   She was walking off Center Court at the All England Club, where
she had achieved the greatest triumph of her career: She had
reached the women's championship round at Wimbledon, taken a huge
step closer to fulfilling a dream and the promise of an intriguing
career. She had came one step closer to winning her first Grand
Slam singles title at tennis' most hallowed address.
</P>
<P>
   There was one problem. Her success had come at the expense of
the person she loved more than anyone else in the world: she had
just beaten her little sister Serena, 6-2, 7-6 (3).
</P>
<P>
   When the match ended on a Serena double fault, the sisters both
looked at each other, frozen. They did not know how to react _
Serena to her sister's elation, Venus to her sister's
disappointment. So they both looked close to tears. There was no
Venus celebration, no fists pumped in the air. That was the most
distressing part of the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Part of a fan's joy is sharing the triumph of the victor. Had
you tuned in after the final point and went merely by facial
expressions, you would have thought this was the first match in
history in which both players lost.
</P>
<P>
   For as long as I've watched the Williams sisters, it wasn't
until this moment I realized how close they really were.
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to the semifinal, the
sister-versus-sister matchup had been hyped for good reason: It was
the first time two sisters had faced each other this deep into a
Grand Slam draw for more than 100 years. The fact that they were
soul sisters added spice.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the buildup, this match wasn't pretty. Intriguing,
yes. Riveting, yes. But far too intense to be called fun to watch.
</P>
<P>
   For everybody who has a sister or a brother, this match may have
hit a nerve. It contained all of the elements of a sibling rivalry:
competition, empathy, envy and guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Zina Garrison, who reached the finals at Wimbledon a decade ago,
knew exactly what was taking place. She was the last
African-American woman to reach a Grand Slam final prior to the
Williams sisters, but before this match was even half over, you
knew this was not about pioneering; it was about family.
</P>
<P>
   Garrison, a mentor to Serena, said the younger sister had been
in awe of the older sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what _ win, lose or draw _ you're going to be the
little sister,'' she said. ``I know from being the youngest, no
matter what I accomplish, or what I do, my big sisters felt that
they could dominate me. It is a big factor.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that that was only part of what unfolded here. ``Today
Venus basically showed that she really wants this tournament,''
said Garrison, who attended the match. ``No matter who she played
today she would have won.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Venus said that during changeovers, she found herself
thinking about her sister. ``I'm sitting over there and I'm
thinking, `Does Serena have enough sports drink?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always taken care of Serena,'' she said. ``That's the way
it's always been. I'm the one doing the driving late at night when
we came home from school. I was always driving with her asleep. I'm
the big sister and that's the way it will always be.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus turned 20 last month; Serena will be 19 in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's really bitter,'' Venus said of winning. ``But
someone had to move on. It was either going to be me or Serena.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Williams said he tried to comfort his youngest child. He
said he told Serena: ``Just think of how many people would love to
be in your position today: you're on Center Court in the most
famous stadium in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't see the match, choosing to stay away. Yet he still
felt the pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard she had tears in her eyes, I felt even sadder,''
he said of Serena. ``I almost had tears in my eyes for my baby.
It's been a tough day overall.''
</P>
<P>
   Will the sisters keep playing these stressful matches? Will the
sister-to-sister mathchups lose some of the edge? ``I think it will
become less spectacular,'' Venus said. ``Most of all, Serena and I
have to promise ourselves to start playing solid tennis every time
so that we can be No. 1 and No. 2, then meet in the finals. It will
be a natural thing.''
</P>
<P>
   And not to mention a relief. A victory should not be this
heartbreaking.
</P>
<P>
   Before they shook hands with the umpire, Venus put her arm
around her younger sister and whispered something. What she told
her sister framed the match, the day, the mood. Venus said: ``Let's
get out of here, Serena.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Vicente Fox's 7-percentage-point margin of victory in Mexico's
presidential election has buoyed the spirits not just of Mexican
voters but of investors and business executives across North
America.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican peso strengthened immediately after the election,
the Mexican stock market rose to a three-month high before dropping
back a bit, and American investors generally were delighted _ not
necessarily because Fox won, but because the decisive way he won
kept Mexico calm and open for business. Many had feared turmoil
resulting from a very close election.
</P>
<P>
   But as people get used to the idea that Mexico's 71 years of
one-party rule are coming to an end, investors, analysts and
business leaders are beginning to ask just how Fox, a former
Coca-Cola executive, intends to handle his country's complex
economic issues. And there are questions whether, in the
interconnected global economy that he says he wants Mexico to
remain part of, he has much leeway at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``First there was this euphoria, then everybody was standing
around scratching their head,'' said John M. Bruton, executive vice
president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Mexico City.
``People of all classes voted for him because they think he can
change their situations. Now, managing expectations is going to be
Mr. Fox's greatest challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   So much of the campaign was focused on change for the sake of
change that other issues did not get much attention. There never
had been much distance between the economic platforms of the
principal candidates, and throughout the campaign Fox avoided
laying out a detailed program of economic reform. Instead, he
offered the standard campaign promises of increasing jobs,
promoting investment and producing economic growth that would help
the millions of Mexicans still living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has made it clear that he intends to stay the economic
course _ opening Mexico to the global economy and embracing free
market discipline _ set by previous administrations, but he has
made it equally clear that he is not happy with the way that many
Mexicans have been left behind.
</P>
<P>
   He supports an independent central bank, a free-floating
exchange rate and increased exports. He even said earlier this week
that the North American Free Trade Agreement should be amplified to
further integrate North America, perhaps with a common currency for
Mexico, the United States and Canada, ``20, 30 or 40 years from
now.''
</P>
<P>
   But he is facing many far more immediate issues, including the
millions of Mexicans who have never recovered the purchasing power
they had before the first of several end-of-administration crises
in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has a reputation as a pragmatist when it comes to business
and the economy. As governor of the small, central state of
Guanajuato, he initiated a program of providing micro loans for
very small businesses as a way of promoting entrepreneurship, a
program he intends to repeat on the national level. He has also
talked about copying Chile's program of providing tax relief for
companies that reinvest in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   One of Fox's first economic tasks will be to name an economic
cabinet that inspires investor confidence in a party that has never
run Mexico. He is said to be considering a treasury secretary who
might come from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, known
as the PRI. One name being mentioned is Luis Tellez, the current
energy secretary and former chief of staff to President Ernesto
Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   Fox must also prepare a federal budget that by law has to be
approved _ by a congress his party does not control _ within 15
days of his inauguration on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's chief economic adviser, Luis Ernesto Derbez, a former
World Bank official who is often mentioned as a possible Treasury
Secretary under Fox, told investors in New York on Thursday that
work had already started on that budget.
</P>
<P>
   Derbez said that Mexican political leaders had been asked to
outline budget priorities and that preliminary talks were under way
with the PRI, as well as the left leaning Party of the Democratic
Revolution, to gauge the limits of cooperation. Fox wants to name
his cabinet by the end of August and present a budget proposal by
the time the congress convenes on Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts will be watching to see how Fox squares his campaign
promise to increase spending for education and social programs with
his pledge to decrease the current budget deficit by half. Derbez
said legislative initiatives would be introduced to close tax
loopholes. He also said the government would consider extending the
value added tax to medicine and food _ but only if there was a way
to soften the effect on the poor.
</P>
<P>
   John B. Chambers, deputy head of the sovereign ratings group at
Standard &AMP; Poor's, said his company's analysts would follow the
budget process and the fall legislative session in Mexico City for
clues to whether the major parties would cooperate or stumble into
gridlock.
</P>
<P>
   Another rating company, Moody's Investors Services, upgraded
Mexico's debt to investment grade in early March, but Standard &AMP;
Poor's did not. This week, S&AMP;P affirmed its rating of one notch
below investment grade, with a positive outlook for an upgrade if
the new administration took care of some pending issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is a question of how effective we think the Fox
administration is going to be in implementing the structural reform
agenda,'' Chambers said. ``Clues on that could come as early as the
fourth quarter of this year.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   S&AMP;P says it will be watching for further strengthening of
Mexico's banking system and deregulation of the electricity and
petroleum sectors. The resignation of the company's chief Mexico
analyst last week will not affect the timing of any decision on a
ratings upgrade, Chambers said.
</P>
<P>
   The last three Mexican administrations ended with currency
devaluations and economic turmoil. Fears of another crisis
diminished with the strength of Fox's victory, and the continuing
strength of Mexico's economy. Jonathan E. Heath, a Mexican
economist who wrote a book on the causes of the
end-of-administration crises, believes most of the factors that
caused those earlier meltdowns _ a fixed exchange rate and an
oversized current accounts deficit, for example _ have been
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still the slim possibility of a shock that would be
caused by an assassination attempt on Fox,'' Heath said, ``but
barring something weird like that, the chances of another crisis
are very slim.`
</P>
<P>
   Rather than a meltdown, some investors are worried that the
post-election ecstasy could actually make Mexico's economy overheat
just as the U.S. economy begins to show signs of slowing down. The
first two days after the election, the Mexican stock market jumped
8.2 percent, but profit taking wiped away some of that gain,
leaving the market up 5.1 percent since the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumption, capital inflows, domestic investment, foreign
direct investment, all are increasing because of this injection of
confidence,'' said Jorge O. Mariscal, chief Latin American
investment strategist for Goldman Sachs. ``The thing to do now is
slow down the Mexican economy using fiscal and monetary means. Fox
needs to address that in the transition.''
</P>
<P>
   For him, Mariscal said, one incident best described the current
mood of excitement and uncertainty in Mexico. Just before the
election, a manufacturer in Mexico City who supported Fox loaded
barrels of fragrances on a pickup truck and drove around the city's
main highway. He wanted voters to know that the possibility of
change was so real they could smell it.
</P>
<P>
   But something went wrong: A barrel spilled onto the roadway, and
there was a multicar pileup.
</P>
<P>
   `Mexico,'' Mariscal said, ``still presents tremendous
challenges.''

 &HT;    Congressman hopes to see dogfight over drug costs
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - National debate over rising prescription drugs
costs has the potential to become a real dogfight. At least an
Austin congressman hopes to make it one.
</P>
<P>
   Certain popular prescriptions cost far more for humans than for
animals, Democrat Lloyd Doggett said at a news conference Thursday
at the Humane Society-SPCA of Austin. Congress, he said, must help
make prescriptions drugs affordable to society's most vulnerable
members _ seniors on Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dogs, cats, horses, cattle get treated far better with
reference to the price of prescription drugs than do our seniors,''
Doggett said to a cacophony of barks and meows. ``If you don't have
prescription coverage as a senior, you're better off if you've got
four legs and a tail.''
</P>
<P>
   Doggett said that while uninsured children and families also pay
more for certain drugs he is focusing on Medicare recipients, who
generally do not receive drug coverage. Medicare is an issue in
Congress, and the elderly take more prescription drugs than the
young, he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 75 percent of those on Medicare, the federal health care
insurance program for people 65 and older and the disabled, lack
dependable private prescription drug coverage, Doggett's office
said.
</P>
<P>
   Drug manufacturers that seem to be charging what the market will
bear, not pharmacies, are at fault, Doggett said.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of pharmaceutical companies could not be
reached.
</P>
<P>
   Doggett's office and staff to the Committee on Government Reform
surveyed pharmacies and Internet veterinary pharmacies to compare
drug costs. In Travis County, Doggett's staff found that a month's
supply of Lodine, a drug used to treat arthritis in humans and
dogs, cost $108.90 for humans and $37.80 for dogs, a 188 percent
difference.
</P>
<P>
   On average, Travis County seniors paid 113 percent more for five
common drugs that animals also use, Doggett's office found.
</P>
<P>
   Public Citizen, a consumer organization created by activist
Ralph Nader, now a presidential candidate, released a report
Thursday that said the prescription medicine industry is continuing
to fight Medicare drug coverage by stepping up contributions to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Doggett received $6,668 from drug industry political action
committees since 1993, a small amount in comparison to U.S. Rep.
Joe Barton, R-Texas, who was No. 1 among the Texas delegation with
$88,752 in donations, according to the Public citizen report.

The handbags of famous women _ but alas, not the queen _ are being
auctioned on eBay by Breast Cancer Care, a British cancer-support
charity. Among the goods and prices as of Thursday, July 6, with
six days of the auction left:
</P>
<P>
   A tiger-print purse donated by  &UR; Cherie Blair &LR; , wife of the prime
minister, lawyer and mother of four, was up to $498. The
description of this item says the purse ``shows a glamorous side''
of the donor.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jerry Hall &LR; , whose glamorous side is already widely known,
donated a red and blue tote that's going for $1,085. The
description, for some reason or other, says that the donor's
favorite handbag (which is not for sale) is a 1950s Cartier
alligator purse ``with a real gold handle.'' The descriptive matter
also notes that Hall ``made the news recently with her decision to
remove all her clothes for her role as Mrs. Robinson in the stage
version of `The Graduate,' '' which ought to boost the value of the
handbag considerably.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Blair and Hall purses are attracting small
change compared with the pick of the handbag litter, a black
Ferragamo donated by former Prime Minister  &UR; Margaret &LR; 
 &UR; Thatcher &LR;  and fetching $152,242. ``The first woman prime minister
and now a member of the House of Lords, Margaret Thatcher is one of
the most famous handbag owners of recent times,'' says the
description. ``It is she who was responsible for the press coining
the expression `handbagging' after observing the way she dealt with

RENO IS ASKED TO INVESTIGATE DEATH OF BLACK MAN AT MALL 
</HEADLINE>
   By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ Rep. John Conyers has asked Attorney General
Janet Reno to investigate the death of a 32-year-old black man who
was choked to death in a shopping mall parking lot during a scuffle
with security guards trying to recover a $4 bracelet.
</P>
<P>
   Conyers, D-Mich., made the request late Wednesday as he and a
coalition of civil rights advocates gathered with more than 9,000
protesters outside the Lord &AMP; Taylor department store where
Frederick Finley died on June 22.
</P>
<P>
   Finley, who had been shopping in the store with his family, was
on his way home to Detroit when five plainclothes security guards
from the store followed him out and accused his 11-year-old
stepdaughter of stealing the bracelet. As the guards tried to
detain her, the police said, Finley punched one of them, and the
other guards put him in a choke hold. Family members said a guard
pressed his knee against Finley's throat.
</P>
<P>
   The incident has left the Fairlane Town Center shopping mall and
this southwestern Detroit suburb on edge, once again grappling with
a long history of racial tension.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the Wayne County prosecutor charged one of the guards,
Dennis Richardson, with involuntary manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under all circumstances, the duration and amount of force used
by Richardson was excessive,'' Prosecutor John D. O'Hair said. The
charge carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison or a fine of
$7,500. Lawyers representing the Finley family said second-degree
murder would have been a more appropriate charge and that
Richardson should not have been the only guard charged.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the charge, and the fact that Richardson and three of
the other guards are black, Conyers, the ranking Democrat on the
House Judiciary Committee, said he still wanted a federal
investigation because he believed Finley was a victim of racial
profiling, which Conyers said was as rampant in retailing as on
highways.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the attorney general confirmed that Reno had
received a call from Conyers and that they had spoken. But the
spokeswoman would not discuss the details of the conversation or
say whether Reno was planning an investigation at this point.
</P>
<P>
   Conyers said blacks who worked for white businesses, just like
whites who worked for white businesses, could be trained to focus
on blacks as criminals. ``It's not just a matter of driving while
black. It's a matter of shopping while black, living while black,''
Conyers said. ``We're not taking it anymore. We demand that the one
place we're supposed to be able to go for civil rights remedies
gets on the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The police have said that Finley's stepdaughter was observed on
videotape taking the bracelet. Lawyers for the family and civil
rights advocates said the girl simply forgot to pay for it. At the
time he died, Finley, a limousine dispatcher, had $604 in his
pocket and had purchased $40 worth of clothing for his
stepdaughter, the lawyers said. Finley and his wife had also given
the store their address and phone number as part of a credit card
application.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had them on videotape, they had their address. They could
have just called the police,'' said Geoffrey Fieger, one of the
lawyers representing the family in a lawsuit against the retailer
and its parent company, the May Corp. ``They didn't have to kill
him. He was only defending his daughter,'' Fieger said.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of civil rights leaders, including the Rev. Al
Sharpton and Dick Gregory, are pressing Lord &AMP; Taylor officials to
disclose the store's policies for training guards and apprehending
suspected shoplifters. A spokeswoman for the department store would
not comment.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, mostly black, who jammed the Lord &AMP; Taylor
parking lot on Wednesday night came with signs and tales of
discrimination and harassment. In between shouting ``no justice, no
profits,'' and slicing up Lord &AMP; Taylor credit cards, they recalled
the climate at the mall just four years ago, when the Detroit
chapter of NAACP urged blacks to boycott the mall because of
accusations of racism. Others told stories of being escorted out of
city parks during the 1980s because of an ordinance that barred
nonresidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've always made it clear out here that we aren't welcome.
They follow you around in the stores, just waiting to pounce,''
said 50-year-old Mary Anne Robinson, one of the protesters. ``Now
they're showing us our lives aren't even worth a $4 bracelet.''

 &HT;    Government displays Davidian weapons during trial
 &HT;    By Mark England
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The government staged its version of a gun show
Thursday in Waco's federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Weapons ranging from a machine gun to grenades were paraded in
front of U.S. District Court Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. and a
five-member advisory jury in the Branch Davidians' $675 million
wrongful-death lawsuit against the government.
</P>
<P>
   All the weapons were found in the rubble of Mount Carmel, after
a fire of disputed origin led to the deaths of David Koresh and 75
followers on April 19, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Government attorneys spent Thursday meticulously detailing many
of the 300 weapons recovered. The list included 60 M-16 rifles, 60
AK-47 rifles, more than 30 AR-15 rifles and two .50 caliber rifles.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Ranger Lt. James Miller, who helped search the ruins,
testified that 47 machine guns were also found.
</P>
<P>
   Government attorney Steve Mason asked another Ranger, Lt. Ray
Coffman, if he had ever seen more assault rifles in one place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not,'' said Coffman, who helped search the concrete
bunker at Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   That included the Texas National Guard armory in Austin, Coffman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were more assault rifles here than I ever saw at Camp
Mabry,'' Coffman said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Rangers found 10,000 rounds of live ammunition
inside the bunker and 400,000 rounds of ammunition destroyed in the
fire. The bunker also contained the bodies of men, women and 24
children.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the bodies were found under a stack of ammunition
several feet high.
</P>
<P>
   Houston attorney Mike Caddell, lead plaintiffs' attorney, tried
to cast doubt on the number and types of weapons found by asking
Miller what agency examined Mount Carmel immediately after the
fire. Miller said an FBI explosives unit went through the area
before allowing the Rangers to conduct their search.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell also noted in questioning Miller that the Rangers
determined the FBI mislabeled numerous items in compiling its list
of weapons at Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   That became apparent last year when Mike McNulty, one of the
producers of ``Waco: Rules of Engagement,'' toured the DPS'
evidence room, which at that time held the Davidian evidence.
McNulty found flashbangs misidentified by the FBI as silencers.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell asked Miller if anything had been done to correct the
FBI's mislabeling. Miller said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just take their word for it,'' Caddell said,
sarcastically.
</P>
<P>
   He also questioned the FBI's labeling of items like lanterns,
propane bottles and gas cans as ``arson debris.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean that every lantern out there had anything to
do with the fire or if any of them did?'' Caddell asked Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, sir,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Several Davidians have testified the group collected weapons to
sell at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   However, a former ``wife'' of Koresh's testified via a
transcribed deposition that Koresh stockpiled weapons as part of
``preparing for the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Dana Okimoto, 34, said she met Koresh in Hawaii in 1986. He
invited her to come to Texas to study with him and other Davidians,
who were living at the time in Palestine, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   She said Koresh asked her to become one of his wives _ or part
of the House of David _ in August 1987. She and Koresh had two
sons, she said. One was born in Torrance, Calif., in September 1988
and the other was born at Mount Carmel in April 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Okimoto said Koresh had 14 or 15 ``wives'' and had sex with some
of them when they were 13 or 14 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Koresh taught all the women at Mount Carmel how to shoot a
shotgun as part of preparing for the end times, Okimoto testified,
adding that the preparation also involved marching military-style
and watching war movies on video.
</P>
<P>
   She said she came to doubt her belief in Koresh about a year
before leaving the Davidians. She left with her sons when Koresh
screamed at her for taking their oldest son, Sky Borne, to a doctor
after he broke his arm.
</P>
<P>
   She said Koresh was upset that his name ``would be in the
system'' as the boy's father.
</P>
<P>
   Okimoto, now a psychiatric nurse, said her feelings about Koresh
are ambivalent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the father of my children, yet I was part of this very
strange belief system,'' Okimoto said. ``... As a mental health
professional, he probably belonged in a hospital somewhere.''

EXPORTING JOBS TO CHINA, ALONG WITH GOODS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed
version of a story that will appear in tomorrow's New York Times.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   TULSA, Okla. _ American business is rushing into China, and
Marilyn C. Grant, a 56-year-old widow who drives a forklift for a
fishing reel company, is being left behind.
</P>
<P>
   The Zebco Corp., Grant's employer, began moving much of its
fishing reel production to China at the end of June, just a few
weeks after the House passed a measure that would end Cold War
restrictions on trade with China. Most of Zebco's 240 workers will
eventually lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In promoting permanent normal trade relations with China, which
the House approved in late May and the Senate is expected to vote
on in late July, President Clinton predicted an ``almost
incalculable'' increase in exports of U.S. goods to China. But the
move also seems likely to encourage exports of some U.S. jobs.
</P>
<P>
   China agreed to open its markets in order to join the World
Trade Organization and to get permanent trading rights in the
United States. That should make it easier to sell American-made
products there. But as China modernizes and loosens controls, its
lure as a manufacturing base is also proving irresistible to many
multinationals.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists say that even if some people lose their jobs,
the United States reaps advantages from trade _ like greater
productivity, higher corporate profits and cheaper spincast reels.
But if people are celebrating these diffuse benefits, they are not
partying as much as Zebco's workers are seething.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the last decade, as it had to fight competitors who paid
much lower hourly wages to workers in Asia, Zebco remained the
dominant fishing tackle brand. Though Zebco once tested production
in Mexico, it pulled back when its Tulsa workers proved they could
produce more reels in less time with fewer defects.
</P>
<P>
   The dike finally gave way this year, however. Zebco found that
it could commission Chinese factories to produce and deliver reels
to the United States for a third less than it could make them at
home, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Zebco decided to make most of its low-end reels at factories in
China. For now, it will continue to produce more expensive reels in
Tulsa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made valiant efforts to keep production in the United
States,'' said Kathryn J. Chieger, a vice president at the
Brunswick Corp., Zebco's parent company, in Lake Forest, Ill. ``We
just had a flood of product coming from Asia at prices we could not
meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the layoffs, which began June 27, left Zebco's
unionized workers perplexed and angry.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the United States was better off with cheaper
fishing reels or job security for Zebco workers, Grant reflected
for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``People might like buying things cheaper,'' she said. ``But
there's a price. They're going to wake up one day and find that
nothing's made here.''

 &HT;    New stamps commemorate baseball greats
 &HT;    By Monique Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Pollack introduced himself and then began telling his
favorite Lou Gehrig stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, a lot of people don't know this, but he thought that
the gutsiest athletes in the world were ballerinas,'' said Pollack,
who is a family friend. ``And he had a great love for opera, but
back then if the baseball players knew that well, you know. Anyway,
he had to sneak in through the back with his collar up.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollack laughed as he remembered the man he met while spending
his afternoons at the ballpark in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   It was at the ballpark that Gehrig and 19 others became the
legends of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   From Christy Mathewson to Jackie Robinson, the U.S. Postal
Service honored 20 major-leaguers Thursday with the first issue of
the Legends of Baseball commemorative postage stamps. An estimated
40,000 stamps were bought at the ceremony and officially go on sale
nationwide today.
</P>
<P>
   Family members and friends of the players honored attended the
event in International Plaza. More than 400 fans and stamp
collectors converged on the plaza to witness the Postal Service's
first collection dedicated to baseball.
</P>
<P>
   James Tolbert, USPS executive director of stamp services, said
the stamps honor not just what the men did in their sport but also
what they did in the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be a great president or politician to be
recognized,'' Tolbert said. ``We want to recognize people for their
dedication in any event and for their accomplishments and what they
did to make where they were a better place.''
</P>
<P>
   The 85-year-old Pollack said the stamps will help perpetuate the
lives of the players represented and allows people to see the human
side of the athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gehrig's baseball statistics were unbelievable,'' he said,
``but this puts a human face to those statistics and now to future
athletes it can begin to mean something.''
</P>
<P>
   For the family of Josh Gibson, the stamp begins to recognize his
accomplishments in the Negro Leagues. Gibson died before he would
see Jackie Robinson break the color barrier in the major leagues in
1947.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only thought stamps and coins were for presidents,'' said
Josh Gibson Jr., 69. ``Now, here's my father, a black man, who
never played in the major leagues, and he's on a stamp. That's
special.''
</P>
<P>
   From the seven batting titles of Rogers Hornsby to the 511 wins
collected by Cy Young in 22 years, the collection brings together
the men who made baseball special in this country, said Hank Aaron,
the home-run king who was a guest of honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these men played before my time,'' Aaron said, ``but
every player in every era owes years of gratitude to them for truly
making baseball America's national pastime.''

ISLAND RADAR BASE LINKED TO MISSILE TEST 
</HEADLINE>

 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In advance of Friday night's critical missile
defense test over the Pacific Ocean, senior Pentagon officials have
quietly put together a construction plan for a $500 million radar
system in western Alaska, underscoring the momentum toward keeping
the project alive into the next administration.
</P>
<P>
   While the results of the test will play a factor in President
Clinton's decision this fall on deploying the missile-defense
system, Defense Department officials have strongly argued that the
president keep the project on track by building the start of a base
on Shemya Island, according to two people with first-hand knowledge
of the Pentagon's plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to do the test and go ahead and pour the concrete
for the radars,'' said a former Defense Department official,
speaking on condition on anonymity. ``They can hold off on the full
deployment decision but still stick to the schedule for completing
the system by 2005.''
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton gave a limited go-ahead, an option strongly favored
by Defense Secretary William S. Cohen, the Pentagon would then
request bids for the ground-based radar system at the western edge
of the Aleutian Island chain.
</P>
<P>
   Barges could then carry the materials in March to a former Air
Force base on the island, just in time for Alaska's
April-to-September construction season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is such a narrow window in Alaska to do construction, to
scrape out the dirt, to pour concrete slabs, to mount radar,'' said
the former official. ``It still gives whoever makes the decision
next, (Texas Governor George W.) Bush or (Vice President Al) Gore,
the option of whether to go forward to build the system.''
</P>
<P>
   A US official, also speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed the Pentagon's plans, saying there was wide consensus
among the top ranks of the Defense Department to keep the project
on schedule until figuring out whether the technology can be
developed to hit incoming missiles more than 100 miles above the
earth.
</P>
<P>
   But such pro-missile defense bias in advance of the test, which
has been evident in past comments by US officials, has sparked
anger from a wide array of opponents, including Russia, China,
European allies, as well as US scientists, corporate leaders and
Nobel laureates.
</P>
<P>
   A group of 50 Nobel laureates this week signed a letter to
Clinton urging him to abandon the $60 billion project, saying it
``would offer little protection and would do grave harm to this
nation's core security interests.''
</P>
<P>
   But many in the administration have strongly argued that such a
system is needed to protect the country against an attack from a
hostile country or an accidental launch of a nuclear weapon aimed
at the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Several scientists, including Michael Mendillo, a professor of
astronomy and electrical and computer engineering at Boston
University, have found fault with the decision-making process.
Mendillo said the launch should be described as an experiment, not
a test, because the conditions are controlled.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise, scheduled to take place between 10 p.m. Friday and
2 a.m. Saturday EDT, involves firing a 63-foot rocket with a mock
warhead from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif. A balloon decoy will
be attached to it. About 15 minutes afterward, a 54-inch
``exoatmospheric kill vehicle'' is then set to be launched from
Kwajalein Atoll, about 4,300 miles away in the Pacific Ocean. It is
hoped the kill vehicle will guide itself into a collision with the
mock warhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you even thought a country was trying to attack us, you
wouldn't tell the adversary where you thought it was going to be,''
Mendillo said Thursday. ``It is such an affront to declare this a
test. No matter what happens, they will declare it a victory
because so much is invested in this.''
</P>
<P>
   In two previous tests, one ``kill vehicle'' hit the target,
while the other missed.
</P>
<P>
   Lieutenant Colonel Rick Lehner, a spokesman for the Ballistic
Missile Defense Office, said if the president approved construction
of the radar system in Alaska, the building would have to start by
April ``to meet the 2005 deadline.'' Lehner reiterated that Clinton
would make the decision, not Pentagon planners.
</P>
<P>
   The former Air Force base, once home to 2,000 officers, is now
occupied by about 65 people working on other missions including a
weather station.
</P>
<P>
   The former Defense Department official said Pentagon lawyers
have extensively reviewed whether the start of building a radar
system would violate terms of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty. The lawyers believe it does not violate the terms because
the concrete pads could be used for several purposes. But the
lawyers have also written in their reports that Russian officials
could be expected to say it represented a violation, the former
official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The test is seen as important, because it gives you more
data,'' said the former official. ``But the Pentagon is planning in
the meantime to go ahead and start the next phase.''

   ``William Wegman: Fashion Photographers''
</P>
<P>
   (Abrams, $19.95)
</P>
<P>
   Wegman's dogs, those long-suffering Weimaraners, are everywhere
these days. We would not be shocked to see them dancing to Gershwin
in the next Gap commercial. Why aren't we tired of them? There's
something fascinating about Wegman's anthropomorphic photographs,
and something so woefully game about the animals that they don't
inspire backlash even as they teeter on the brink of saturation.
Here the dogs are fashion models, posing in shoes by Yves Saint
Laurent (a bad fit), a fur coat by Isaac Mizrahi, tuxedos by
Valentino, shirts by Armani. We wonder: Do they really sit
willingly like that in wigs and sunglasses? Or does Wegman
tyrannize them somehow, forcing them to pose? Either way, they are
oddly beautiful as they solicit our interest and affection. ``My
Weimaraners are perfect fashion models,'' Wegman says. ``Their
elegant slinky forms are covered in gray, and gray, everyone knows,
goes with anything.''

   ``Chicken Run: Hatching the Movie''
</P>
<P>
   By Brian Sibley
</P>
<P>
   (Abrams, $35)
</P>
<P>
   We are sick of these chickens already, no matter how good the
movie is. We have a close association with an 8-year-old, however,
and we observed that this book distracted him from the Pokimon
scourge for an entire afternoon. The result: We have built a shrine
to Brian Sibley in our house and are lighting candles daily in his
name. Actually, we enjoyed the book ourselves, because it's about
the extraordinary and exhaustive animation that went into creating
a feature-length film starring a bunch of clay birds. (Sibley also
addresses such questions as, ``How many fluffles are on Bunty's
bottom?'' The answer: 3,077, and aren't they grand?) There are lots
of behind-the-scenes photographs and stories about the making of
the movie, as well as sketches, storyboards, a foreword by Mel
Gibson and a cameo appearance by Wallace and Gromit. And, oh yes,
there are chickens everywhere, and they translate very well to the
page.

   ``The Better Angel''
</P>
<P>
   By Roy Morris Jr.
</P>
<P>
   (Oxford, $25)
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 16, 1862, Walt Whitman saw the name of his brother,
George, in a newspaper list of men recently wounded in the Civil
War. George had been encamped at Fredericksburg, Va. Within an hour
Whitman had packed up and left New York, determined to find his
brother, dead or alive. It was, says Morris, the beginning of the
rest of Walt Whitman's life, for although he would find George with
only minor wounds, there were plenty of soldiers whose luck had not
held up so well. Whitman became obsessed with them. Over the
ensuing months, he devoted himself to the aftermath of battles,
visiting tens of thousands of maimed and broken men who filled
military hospitals and convalescent camps. He brought them gifts,
friendship and his own exuberance. This is the flattering story of
Whitman's effect on those soldiers and theirs on him and his work.
``If he was not literally an angel,'' writes Morris, ``he was more
than a passable substitute.''

KENNEDY REFUSED INSTRUCTOR'S OFFER TO FLY ON FATAL NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s flight instructors, believing him
unprepared for a solo flight over water on a dark, hazy night,
offered to fly with him on the night of Kennedy's fatal crash. But
Kennedy responded that he ``wanted to do it alone,'' the instructor
told the National Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
   The instructor's concerns and Kennedy's reply were revealed in
the board's final report on the July 16, 1999, accident which was
released Thursday. The report concludes that, during the flight
from New Jersey to Martha's Vineyard, Kennedy became disoriented in
the hazy night over the Atlantic Ocean and lost control of his
airplane, which crashed, killing him, his wife Carolyn, and her
sister.
</P>
<P>
   The report, like many issued by the NTSB in the wake of general
aviation accidents, offers only a simple description of the
accident's probable cause and never identifies the pilot,
passengers, or persons interviewed by name. But appended to the
report is an unusual extended narrative portrait of Kennedy's
skills as a pilot and his training.
</P>
<P>
   The narrative reveals that Kennedy and his instructor had flown
his Piper Saratoga II to Martha's Vineyard on the night of July 1 _
about two weeks before the crash _ when visibility was restricted
at the island airport. The instructor told investigators that
Kennedy ``seemed competent . . . but may have had difficulty
performing additional tasks under such conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The unnamed instructor told investigators he was not aware that
Kennedy had ever previously flown the Saratoga without an
instructor on board. And he said he believed at the time that
Kennedy would need additional training before he would be ready to
be tested on flying by instruments alone.
</P>
<P>
   The instructor ``also stated that he would not have felt
comfortable with the accident pilot conducting night flight
operations on a route similar to the one flown on, and in weather
conditions similar to those that existed on the night of the
accident. The instructor further stated that he had talked to the
pilot on the day of the accident and offered to fly with him on the
accident flight. He stated that the accident pilot replied that `he
wanted to do it alone,' '' the report states.
</P>
<P>
   The report, whose basic conclusions were revealed in news
stories last month, states the accident was caused by ``the pilot's
failure to maintain control of the airplane during a descent over
water at night, which was a result of spatial disorientation.
Factors in the accident were haze, and the dark night.''
</P>
<P>
   Spatial disorientation refers to the confusion that can occur
when no horizon is visible and a pilot loses a sense of how the
plane is headed. The pilot may believe the plane is flying with
wings level when it is out of control, or, conversely, feel that
the plane is turning or rolling when it is not.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB findings confirm early speculation that pilot error
caused the crash. No mechanical problem with the aircraft was found
after the wreckage was recovered in about 120 feet of water seven
miles off the coast of Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's uncle, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, had no comment on
the report, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-page narrative appended to the NTSB report describes
Kennedy as a generally competent pilot for his experience level _
he had more than 300 hours of flight time, with about 260 in the
two years before the crash. But, also in keeping with his level of
experience and training, Kennedy was viewed as a pilot who could
find it difficult to handle several cockpit tasks at once.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy also appears to have been eager to obtain a rating that
would have permitted him to fly in poor visibility using only
cockpit instruments for guidance _ the sort of skills he would have
had to rely on the night of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   On March 12, 1999, he completed the Federal Aviation
Administration written test on airplane instruments and received a
score of 78 percent, eight points above a passing grade. And in
April, he returned to Flight Safety International (where he had
enrolled in 1998 in a pilot training program and got his license)
in Florida to begin an instrument rating course.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's instructor there told investigators that he had
completed the first 12 of 25 lesson plans and had no problems until
lesson 11, which is designed to develop a student's familiarity
with radio beacon navigation aids while flying under guidance from
air-traffic controllers. It took him four attempts to pass that
section.
</P>
<P>
   The flight instructor ``stated that the pilot's basic instrument
flying skills and simulator work were excellent,'' according to the
report. ``However (the instructor) stated that the pilot had
trouble managing multiple tasks while flying, which he felt was
normal for the pilot's level of experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy had flown his Piper Saratoga II airplane, which he
bought in April 1999, for some 36 hours, fewer than 10 of them at
night. Most of the flights were with instructors from New Jersey,
where the plane was based, and they included several flights from
Caldwell, N.J., to Martha's Vineyard, at least one of which
required the use of instruments to land. Kennedy handled that feat,
according to the report, but he needed assistance with the rudder
pedals because of a broken ankle he suffered while hang gliding.
</P>
<P>
   Another New Jersey flight instructor flew with Kennedy in
several airplanes for 39 hours, including 21 at night, and nearly
an hour in instrument conditions. An unspecified amount of that
flight time was in the Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   And still another flight instructor who signed Kennedy off in
the high-performance Saratoga said that once or twice the
airplane's autopilot turned to a heading other than the one
selected, which required turning the autopilot off and then on
again. In the final moments of Kennedy's flight before it went into
a steep dive, falling more than 4,700 feet per minute, the plane
made some turns in course and changes in altitude that indicate
either the autopilot was turned off or was malfunctioning.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also interviewed several pilots who flew that
night. The FAA told Kennedy that visual flight conditions existed
all along the route, meaning that Kennedy did not technically need
to have an instrument rating to continue his flight to the
Vineyard, where he planned to drop off his sister-in-law, Lauren
Bessette. John and Carolyn Bessette Kennedy then planned to
continue on to Hyannis for the wedding of his cousin, Rory Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   One pilot flying to Nantucket told investigators that his global
positioning system told him he was over Martha's Vineyard. ``He
looked down and `there was nothing to see. There was no horizon, no
light. . . . I turned left toward Martha's Vineyard to see if it
was visible but could see no lights of any kind nor any evidence of
the island. . . . I thought the island might have suffered a power
failure,' '' the report quotes the pilot as saying. And as the
pilot neared Nantucket, he turned on to a final approach and had to
use his instruments because he could not hold his altitude by
observations of the horizon or the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The narrative also revealed that, earlier in the flight, Kennedy
may have violated a rule requiring all pilots to contact air
traffic and get clearance before entering controlled airspace
around busy airports.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently Kennedy's plane wandered into such airspace near the
Westchester County Airport. An American Airlines Fokker 100 was
preparing to land when air-traffic controllers alerted the plane to
an unidentified airplane nearby that was ``not talking to
anybody.'' The planes were close enough that the on-board traffic
collision avoidance system sounded an alert on the American
Airlines plane. No course correction was required and the American
plane landed safely.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB report indicates that a review of radar data correlated
the unknown aircraft with the track of Kennedy's final flight.

   Barges could then carry the materials in March to a former Air
Force base on the island, just in time for Alaska's
April-to-September construction season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is such a narrow window in Alaska to do construction, to
scrape out the dirt, to pour concrete slabs, to mount radar,'' said
the former official. ``It still gives whoever makes the decision
next, (Texas Governor George W.) Bush or (Vice President Al) Gore,
the option of whether to go forward to build the system.''
</P>
<P>
   A US official, also speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed the Pentagon's plans, saying there was wide consensus
among the top ranks of the Defense Department to keep the project
on schedule until figuring out whether the technology can be
developed to hit incoming missiles more than 100 miles above the
earth.
</P>
<P>
   But such pro-missile defense bias in advance of the test, which
has been evident in past comments by US officials, has sparked
anger from a wide array of opponents, including Russia, China,
European allies, as well as US scientists, corporate leaders and
Nobel laureates.
</P>
<P>
   A group of 50 Nobel laureates this week signed a letter to
Clinton urging him to abandon the $60 billion project, saying it
``would offer little protection and would do grave harm to this
nation's core security interests.''
</P>
<P>
   But many in the administration have strongly argued that such a
system is needed to protect the country against an attack from a
hostile country or an accidental launch of a nuclear weapon aimed
at the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Several scientists, including Michael Mendillo, a professor of
astronomy and electrical and computer engineering at Boston
University, have found fault with the decision-making process.
Mendillo said the launch should be described as an experiment, not
a test, because the conditions are controlled.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise, scheduled to take place between 10 p.m. Friday and
2 a.m. Saturday EDT, involves firing a 63-foot rocket with a mock
warhead from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif. A balloon decoy will
be attached to it. About 15 minutes afterward, a 54-inch
``exoatmospheric kill vehicle'' is then set to be launched from
Kwajalein Atoll, about 4,300 miles away in the Pacific Ocean. It is
hoped the kill vehicle will guide itself into a collision with the
mock warhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you even thought a country was trying to attack us, you
wouldn't tell the adversary where you thought it was going to be,''
Mendillo said Thursday. ``It is such an affront to declare this a
test. No matter what happens, they will declare it a victory
because so much is invested in this.''
</P>
<P>
   In two previous tests, one ``kill vehicle'' hit the target,
while the other missed.
</P>
<P>
   Lieutenant Colonel Rick Lehner, a spokesman for the Ballistic
Missile Defense Office, said if the president approved construction
of the radar system in Alaska, the building would have to start by
April ``to meet the 2005 deadline.'' Lehner reiterated that Clinton
would make the decision, not Pentagon planners.
</P>
<P>
   The former Air Force base, once home to 2,000 officers, is now
occupied by about 65 people working on other missions including a
weather station.
</P>
<P>
   The former Defense Department official said Pentagon lawyers
have extensively reviewed whether the start of building a radar
system would violate terms of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty. The lawyers believe it does not violate the terms because
the concrete pads could be used for several purposes. But the
lawyers have also written in their reports that Russian officials
could be expected to say it represented a violation, the former
official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The test is seen as important, because it gives you more
data,'' said the former official. ``But the Pentagon is planning in
the meantime to go ahead and start the next phase.''

BUSH GETS SPECIAL BIRTHDAY `GIFTS' FROM HISPANIC TEXAS DEMOCRATS 
 
(INCL. TRIM INDICATORS) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JULIE MASON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ On the occasion of his 54th birthday, Gov. George W.
Bush on Thursday received from Tejano Democrats a gift of two
prepaid phone cards and a round-trip bus ticket to visit housing
developments for the poor on the Texas-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel he's not done enough for our people, like he claims
to,'' said Frumencio Reyes, vice chairman of the Texas Democratic
Party and a member of the Tejano Democrats of Harris County.
</P>
<P>
   As he campaigns for president, Bush is reaching out to Hispanic
organizations and voters, touting his record in Texas on issues of
concern to minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes said his group hopes Bush will use one of the phone cards
to call on Texas' Republican U.S. senators, Phil Gramm and Kay
Bailey Hutchison, and ask them to rescind their opposition to El
Paso lawyer Enrique Moreno's appointment to the 5th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno was nominated by President Clinton to the New
Orleans-based court in September. His confirmation process stalled
after Hutchison and Gramm questioned his qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning last week, Bush said he would speak with both
senators to hear their concerns about Moreno, but stopped short of
saying he would intervene on Moreno's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to lobby this,'' Bush said at a campaign stop
in Michigan. ``I am going to find out what the facts are.''
</P>
<P>
   The second phone card is for Bush to use calling on Texas Health
Commissioner Dr. William ``Reyn'' Archer III to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Archer, a 1997 Bush appointee, angered Hispanic groups by
linking Texas' high rate of teen-age pregnancy to Hispanic cultural
resistance to family planning. He later apologized, and Bush has
said he thinks Archer is doing ``a fine job.''
</P>
<P>
   The bus ticket to Pharr, Texas, would take Bush on his first
visit to the border area's (SET ITAL) colonias, (END ITAL) where
some 400,000 people, mostly Hispanic, live in substandard
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, Bush has taken credit for improving
conditions in the (SET ITAL) colonias (END ITAL) and improving
access to health care coverage for the poor and uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our three gifts are designed to make the governor's birthday a
happy occasion for all Texans,'' Reyes said at a news conference in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``On today of all days, he should be in a good mood and
therefore willing to do the right thing on Enrique Moreno, Reyn
Archer, and the 400,000 people who live in (SET ITAL) colonias (END
ITAL),'' Reyes said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The two 60-minute phone cards and the bus ticket cost about $80.
Postage to the governor's post office box in Austin cost about $11.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in Washington also gave Bush a birthday bashing, as
the Democratic National Committee poked fun at his relationship
with oil companies with a cake decorated with oil pumps.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The governor got more traditional and friendlier greetings at
home in Austin, as he returned to the Governor's Mansion from a
noontime jog. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Staffers jumped out from behind bushes and a gazebo yelling,
``Surprise!'' About 300 workers from Bush's office and presidential
campaign then threw him a party on the lawn, singing ``Happy
Birthday'' and serving cake.

STARR'S FORMER SPOKESMAN CHARGED WITH CONTEMPT IN CASE ON LEAKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The former spokesman for Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel who recommended the impeachment of President
Clinton, has been charged with criminal contempt in an
investigation of news leaks in the Monica Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Norma Holloway Johnson of Federal District Court here
ordered the former aide, Charles Bakaly, to stand trial starting
July 13, according to recently unsealed court documents that were
reviewed by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The documents do not specify precisely why Bakaly faces criminal
charges, but they indicate that his legal problems stem from
statements he made in an investigation of leaks from Starr's office
in the independent counsel's impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly requested a public trial in the case and Johnson signed
an order on June 29 granting his motion, the court documents said.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly did not return telephone calls and there was no answer at
the home of one of his lawyers Thursday night. The home phone of a
second lawyer was unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a front-page article published in The New York Times
on Jan. 31, 1999, in the president's impeachment trial before the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The article reported that Starr had concluded, after intensive
discussions with constitutional scholars in his office, that he had
the constitutional authority to indict a sitting president.
</P>
<P>
   The article noted that Starr had not decided whether, or when,
to seek such an indictment. It cited ``several associates of Mr.
Starr'' as sources and quoted Bakaly as saying that no one in the
office would discuss Starr's plans ``in any way, shape or form.''
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly denied at the time that he was a source of the article
and has maintained his denials. But after an internal investigation
of unauthorized disclosures from Starr's office, Bakaly abruptly
resigned from the independent counsel's office on March 11, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Starr said he accepted Bakaly's resignation ``with regret,'' but
left no doubt that his aide's departure and the newspaper
disclosures were linked.
</P>
<P>
   Editors at The Times have said they do not and will not discuss
the sources for the article.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson oversaw the grand jury that Starr used to gather
evidence about Clinton's relationship with Lewinsky. She repeatedly
warned all parties in the case against discussing grand jury
material with news organizations. She ruled in favor of Clinton's
lawyers when they accused Starr and his associates of discussing
privileged material with reporters from a number of news
organizations and asked them to stop doing so..
</P>
<P>
   But in September 1999 a federal appeals court overruled Judge
Johnson, saying there was nothing illegal in discussions by Starr
or his aides with reporters about deliberations over whether to
indict Clinton. The three-judge appeals court panel ruled
unanimously that such discussions were not covered by grand jury
secrecy rules and their publication did not violate any laws.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly apparently faces legal jeopardy not for any role he might
have played in disclosing such information, but rather for
statements he made to Justice Department officials who investigated
the office of independent counsel for illegal disclosures of grand
jury material in the wake of The Times article and other press
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The action against Bakaly makes him the second figure in the
bitter and deeply partisan White House sex and lies scandal to face
federal criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Hiatt Steele, a minor player in the Lewinsky drama, was
indicted on federal fraud charges but escaped conviction when a
jury deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the chief state prosecutor of Maryland dropped criminal
wiretapping charges against Linda Tripp, the Pentagon employee who
secretly recorded conversations with Lewinsky about her affair with
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Stephen F. Montanarelli, said he had abandoned
the case because a judge suppressed testimony by Lewinsky that
Montanarelli said was crucial to obtaining a conviction.

REV. B. CLAYTON BELL SR., PRESBYTERIAN LEADER AND BILLY GRAHAM KIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. B. Clayton Bell Sr., a nationally known Presbyterian
church leader and the brother-in-law of evangelist Billy Graham,
died Tuesday in Montreat, N.C. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Bell was minister-emeritus of Highland Park Presbyterian
Church in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service is scheduled for 3 p.m. Monday at the
Highland Park church, 3821 University Blvd., in Dallas. Private
burial will be handled by Sparkman-Hillcrest Funeral Home.
Memorials are asked to be made to the Bell Memorial Fund at
Highland Park Presbyterian.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Bell led the Highland Park congregation for more than 26
years before his retirement Jan. 31. He was known for his writings
and sermons on family life, moral and social issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a great man, and I know the Lord welcomed him home,''
said one of Rev. Bell's close friends, Bill Broocks, a retired
Dallas businessman and a major official in the governing body of
the 5,400-member Highland Park church, the third largest
congregation in the Presbyterian Church U.S.A.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Bell, executive chairman of the board of Christianity
Today, was a founder of the Presbyterians for Renewal, a group
which urges a greater focus on spiritual life and evangelism. He
was also a national spokesman for the denomination's conservatives
who oppose ordination of gays or allowing same-sex union ceremonies
in the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Bell was a giant in our Presbyterian church's life,'' said
the Rev. Bob Thompson, pastor of Hemphill Presbyterian Church in
Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, the Highland Park church was the denomination's
largest congregation. But a split occurred several years ago when
some members resisted the reunion of the northern and southern
branches of the denomination.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Bell favored remaining in the reunited denomination.
</P>
<P>
   He was the brother of Ruth Bell Graham, wife of the evangelist.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Bell was born in China, where his parents, the late Dr.
Nelson L. and Mrs. Virginia Bell, were medical missionaries for 25
years. He held a bachelor's degree from Wheaton College in Illinois
and a master's degree from Columbia Theological Seminary in
Decatur, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Bell's speaking schedule was full through 2002, his former
secretary, Diane Warner, said yesterday. He was in Montreat to
speak at the Presbyterian Retreat Center and spent July 4th with
the Graham family, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was planning on working with Billy Graham in one of his
upcoming crusades,'' Warner said. ``Also, he was looking forward to
taking a trip around the world, which the church had given him and
his wife as a retirement gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife, Peggy; two sons, the Rev. L. Nelson
Bell II of Tulsa, Okla., and Ben C. Bell of Dallas; two daughters,
Margaret Bell Lindstromand Virginia Lucille Bell Petty of Dallas;
and 10 grandchildren.

 U.S. NAMES SOME COUNTRIES SCIENTIST MIGHT HAVE TRIED TO HELP 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After months of resisting, federal prosecutors
Thursday identified Australia, Switzerland, China and several other
countries as some of the nations that a scientist accused security
breaches at the Los Alamos National Laboratory might have been
trying to assist.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the scientist, Wen Ho Lee, immediately ridiculed
some entries on the list. ``These are not countries which anyone
other than the prosecutors have identified as presenting any kind
of nuclear threat to the United States,'' Mark Holscher, one of the
lawyers, said.
</P>
<P>
   But the filing, which came only after U.S. District Judge James
A. Parker ordered it, did reinforce a government theory that Lee
might have improperly downloaded the vast trove of secret weapons
data because he wanted to enhance his job prospects with a foreign
agency after being told by the laboratory in the early 1990s that
he might be laid off.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's lawyers flatly rejected the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   In its filing Thursday, the government said that in about 1993,
Lee wrote letters to institutions in Australia, France, Germany,
Hong Kong, Singapore, Switzerland and Taiwan seeking employment.
</P>
<P>
   The government also stated that at one time Lee had made contact
with officials from the Institute of Applied Physics and
Computational Mathematics in China, though it did not provide a
reason.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Chavez, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in
Albuquerque, N.M., where the case is being heard, said that
prosecutors would not comment beyond the three-page document.
</P>
<P>
   For some time, Lee's lawyers have demanded that the prosecutors
provide a so-called bill of particulars, specifying which countries
the government believed Lee was trying to assist.
</P>
<P>
   Those details are important, because Lee is charged not just
with improperly downloading the data, but doing so with the
intention of aiding a foreign country and harming the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   George A. Stamboulidis, the assistant U.S. attorney who is
leading the prosecution, in his filing Thursday left the government
maximum flexibility by keeping its case against Lee vague.
</P>
<P>
   He argued that Lee had not necessarily decided which country he
intended to assist when he downloaded the weapons data.
Stamboulidis also contended that the government needed to prove
only that Lee intended to harm the United States and not
necessarily that he intended to provide an advantage to another
country.
</P>
<P>
   Stamboulidis also said that the government could add names to
the list in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who is 60, was originally the subject of a sweeping
investigation because of concerns that he might have given China
the secret to developing a miniaturized American warhead known as
the W-88. Because of those concerns, he was fired from his job in
March 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But when Lee was indicted on 59 felony counts in December, it
was not for espionage. Instead, he faces charges that he had
improperly downloaded the data from a secure to an unsecure
computer, then placed the information on portable computer tapes.
Seven of those tapes have never been recovered, though Lee has said
that, in keeping with lab policy, he destroyed them.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's lawyers have not disputed that he received a notice saying
he might be laid off, or that he contacted some institutions about
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   They have said, though, that Lee's contact with the scientific
institute in China was an official trip paid for and sponsored by
the laboratory. And they rejected the idea that any downloading Lee
did had anything to do with improving his job prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the most noteworthy thing about this is that after all
those months investigating him and seven months after indicting
him, they still don't have a theory on what he was doing or who he
was trying to help,'' Nancy Hollander, another lawyer for Lee,
said.

A CALL FOR FAIR ACCESS TO FUTURE AIDS VACCINE

   DURBAN, South Africa _ Though a vaccine to prevent AIDS is years
away, steps should be taken now to enable a vaccine to be
distributed widely in the Third World as soon as it becomes
available, a leading group in the vaccine effort said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As the 13th International AIDS Conference prepared to open here
on Sunday, the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, a research
consortium supported by government and private grants, issued a
blueprint to provide simultaneous access to an AIDS vaccine in rich
and poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   The group argued that economics alone fails to fully explain the
long delays that often ensue before vaccines become available in
developing countries and urged steps to harmonize the hodgepodge of
regulations that govern vaccine approval and use.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not too soon to plan for an AIDS vaccine because failure
to act promptly would repeat the tragedy of the widespread lack of
availability to anti-HIV drugs,'' said Dr. Seth Berkley, the
president of the Vaccine Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has concluded that AIDS threatens to severely
damage the economies of sub-Saharan countries like South Africa,
Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana and Swaziland where HIV, the virus that
causes AIDS, has infected at least 20 percent of adults.
</P>
<P>
   Most health officials believe a vaccine would be the most
effective weapon in stopping the epidemic. However, the most
severely affected countries would be the least able to afford a
vaccine. Also, many developing countries do not have the network of
health systems needed to deliver a vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Vaccine manufacturers usually limit their initial production for
markets in developed countries, resulting in a delay of about 15
years before vaccines are widely introduced into developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The delay is ``a colossal public health failure'' that should
not be repeated with AIDS, Berkley said. He said a delay of five
years could cost 20 million or more lives.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are challenged in developing an AIDS vaccine largely
because of the virus' ability to mutate. Two years ago, the
pipeline for AIDS vaccines was nearly empty. But today, the Vaccine
Initiative said, there are promising products in early development,
although there is still no plan to get any to the most affected
communities in the world.

BOARD BLAMES PILOT ERROR IN CRASH OF KENNEDY PLANE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The cause of the plane crash that killed John F.
Kennedy Jr., his wife and sister-in-law a year ago was probably
that Kennedy, with hardly any experience flying his plane alone at
night, became disoriented in haze, the National Transportation
Safety Board said Thursday in a staff report.
</P>
<P>
   One of his flight instructors offered to fly with him that
night, but Kennedy said ``he wanted to do it alone,'' the
instructor told the investigators who prepared the report.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who had not yet qualified for flying with instruments
alone (as opposed to having a visible horizon) probably had less
than one hour's experience flying his plane at night without an
instructor, the report said. It noted that a common cause of
crashes among pilots untrained in instrument flying is taking off
when visibility is good (a situation known as Visual Flight Rules,
or VFR) but flying into conditions where it is not, making the
piloting more difficult than they can handle.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the report said, the condition was haze that
obscured the horizon. Pilots who cannot see the horizon must rely
on instruments to tell if they are in level flight or if they are
banking into a turn. But a disoriented pilot can bank a plane into
a fatal spiral.
</P>
<P>
   The report cited six kinds of illusion that can lead to
disorientation, without stipulating which one came into play in
this case. ``Spacial disorientation as a result of continued VFR
flight into adverse weather conditions is regularly near the top of
the cause/factor list in annual statistics on fatal aircraft
accidents,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Using the autopilot would have helped, according to aviation
experts, because it is not subject to disorientation, but Kennedy
was flying his plane manually.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flying at night over featureless terrain or water, and
particularly in haze or in overcast, is a prime setup for spatial
disorientation, because you've lost the horizon,'' said Warren
Morningstar, a spokesman for the Aircraft Owners and Pilots
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The crash killed Kennedy, 38, who was at the controls of his
single-engine Piper Saratoga II; his wife, Carolyn Bessette
Kennedy, 33; and her sister, Lauren Bessette, 34.
</P>
<P>
   From the weather forecasts, Kennedy would have known that he
would be out of sight of land on his trip, Morningstar said. ``It
becomes a question of pilot judgment: do you put yourself into that
situation if you're not appropriately trained and rated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how much experience Kennedy had is not clear, because
investigators did not recover his logbook. But they estimated that
he had logged around 310 hours, including 55 at night. He had flown
only about 72 hours without a flight instructor on board, an
unusually low number, according to instructors. But he had been
studying for his instrument rating, one reason for having few
unsupervised hours.
</P>
<P>
   Weather reports on the night of the crash _ July 16, 1999 _
cited haze or mist and visibility as low as four miles. Pilots who
flew over the Cape Cod-Martha's Vineyard area that night reported
serious haze; one told investigators he had flown over Martha's
Vineyard and thought there was a power failure on the island,
because he could not see any lights.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that investigators had interviewed one of
Kennedy's flight instructors, who said he ``would not have felt
comfortable'' with Kennedy ``conducting night flight operations on
a route similar to the one flown on, and in weather conditions
similar to those that existed on, the night of the accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Another instructor told the investigators that he had made the
flight to Martha's Vineyard with Kennedy six or seven times, often
at night. ``The instructor stated that the pilot was methodical
about his flight planning and that he was very cautious about his
aviation decision-making,'' said the report. The instructor also
said that Kennedy ``had the capability to conduct a night flight''
to Martha's Vineyard, ``as long as a visible horizon existed.'' The
plane crashed about 7.5 miles southwest of Gay Head, at the
island's western end.
</P>
<P>
   Like most reports on the crashes of private planes, this one was
issued by the board's staff, without a hearing or a meeting by the
five board members to approve its contents, as is usually done for
airline crashes. The report runs substantially longer than the
average for general aviation accidents, however. It is available on
the Web at www.ntsb.gov/aviation/nyc/99a178.htm.

BRADLEY WILL OFFER SUPPORT TO GORE SOON, OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ending months of silence, former Sen. Bill Bradley will appear
alongside Vice President Al Gore next week to voice what Democratic
officials described Thursday night as his ``enthusiastic support''
for the man who trounced him in the bitterly contested Democratic
presidential primaries last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Though details of the joint event were still being thrashed out
Thursday evening, the officials said the two men were expected to
meet at a rally next Thursday in Green Bay, Wisc. Wisconsin is
considered a key battleground state. The officials said the
appearance might be just the first of several joint events before
the November election.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance comes just as Gore is working hard to unify the
party in time for the Democratic National Convention next month,
the event many Democrats are counting on to give his campaign a
boost going into the stretch run this fall.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Gore has been trying to energize the Democratic
base in his public appearances by attacking the oil and
pharmaceutical industries.
</P>
<P>
   Smoothing things over with Bradley would be an important step in
the process of energizing the party, many Democrats say. A cloud of
bitterness has hung over their relationship since Bradley quit the
race in March without having won a single state. Some Democrats
contend that friction has hurt Gore's ability to present a united
front for the party.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was furious with what he considered Gore's dishonest
attacks on his campaign agenda, particularly his proposal for
universal health care. At the news conference where he announced
his withdrawal from the race, Bradley said he would support the
vice president, but refused to use the word ``endorse.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he would not release the roughly 400 delegates he
had won until the convention, raising the possibility that he might
start some policy fights with the vice president's camp. And he
even chided Gore for his hard-edged campaign style, a criticism the
Republicans have repeatedly echoed in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that he'll run a better campaign in the general
election,'' Bradley said of Gore at the time.
</P>
<P>
   But a Democratic official familiar with the negotiations said
that Bradley will ``make it very clear that the vice president has
his enthusiastic support.'' The official said it was even possible
that Bradley would use the word ``endorse,'' though Bradley is
well-known for changing his mind on such tactical matters at the
last minute.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's unequivocal support could help take the edge off
Republican assertions that Gore is a dirty fighter and dishonest
politician who will do or say whatever it takes to win. And because
Bradley received support from Republicans and independents, he
could help Gore woo some of the swing voters who are likely to
determine the outcome in closely contested states.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Discussions about when Bradley would campaign with Gore had been
going on for several months, primarily between Tony Coelho, the
former head of the Gore campaign, and John Roos, a fund-raiser and
confidante to Bradley. William Daley, who replaced Coelho and had a
good relationship with Bradley, picked up the negotiations when
Coelho quit last month.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides have also agreed on Bradley's role at the
convention, one official familiar with the negotiations said. The
official said Bradley will address the convention at a prominent,
possibly prime-time slot. But the official would not say which day
Bradley would speak.
</P>
<P>
   With Gore starting to draw stark contrasts between himself and
his Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush, this seemed like the
right time for the two former rivals to appear together, an aide to
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're beginning to ramp into the convention,'' he said. ``It's
a good time for all Democrats to come together and focus on the
task at hand. The differences between Gore and Bradley are
minuscule compared to the miles of differences between them and
George W. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   The aide continued, ``Both Gore and Bradley were in favor of
improving our health care system and George W. Bush has not offered
anything of substance.''

DUNN NAMED ONE OF THREE CO-CHAIRS OF GOP CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Rep. Jennifer Dunn was named Thursday as one of three
co-chairs to preside over evening sessions of next month's
Republican National Convention, an appointment that backers say
signals presidential candidate George W. Bush's resolve to put a
new outward face on his party.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn will share duties in Philadelphia with Texas Rep. Henry
Bonilla, an Hispanic, and Oklahoma Rep. J.C. Watts, the lone
African American Republican member of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some symbolism in it, showing the soft side of the
conservative image,'' Dunn said. While she, Bonilla and Watts
``obviously look like representatives of different groups,'' Dunn
added, the three work well together in the House.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert was tapped as permanent chairman of
the convention. Hastert is likely to preside at the Republicans'
morning sessions. Dunn, Bonilla and Watts will be at the podium
during evening sessions which are part of TV networks' scaled-back
convention coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively high-profile role for Dunn is a signal that
Washington would assume an importance in a Bush administration
``more than it has had for any previous Republican president,''
Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., said Thursday. Gorton has emerged as a
prominent adviser to the Texas governor on environmental, forest
and salmon issues.
</P>
<P>
   Chairing a convention once brought national notoriety, such as
when House Majority leader Carl Albert wielded a gavel that
silenced reformist and anti-war Democrats at the party's tumultuous
1968 convention in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Although today's conventions are carefully scripted, Dunn is
likely to be seen sharing the podium with such prime-time GOP
speakers as retired Gen. Colin Powell, Arizona Sen. John McCain and
former cabinet officer Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn has risen in the Republican Party due to two skills, a
formidable prowess at fund-raising and the ability to put a kinder
face on House Republicans' policies than the party's male leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn was an early, enthusiastic supporter of Newt Gingrich, who
in 1995 became the first GOP House speaker in 40 years. She signed
on equally early with the George W. Bush campaign. She has served
as one of the ``Pioneers,'' the fund-raisers who last year
committed themselves to raise at least $100,000 apiece for the
Texan's race for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Dunns estimates that she has raised $300,000 for Bush, plus an
equal amount for the Republican National Committee, during
appearances around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn headed the Washington state primary campaign in which Bush
defeated McCain, even though Washington, with its deep reservoir of
independent voters, was a prime target for the Arizona senator.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn, Bonilla and Virginia Gov. James Gillmore also have been
tapped for roles as principal spokespersons for the Republican
National Committee during the fall campaign. She has been working
closely on GOP fund-raising with former Texas Republican chairman
Fred Meyer, Bush's chief liaison with the party apparatus in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Having lost a race for House majority leader, Dunn has been
frequently mentioned as a secretary of Commerce or U.S. Trade
Representative in a Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``There you go again!'' Dunn said, borrowing an old Ronald
Reagan line, when asked about a prospective cabinet job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to be on the House Ways and Means Committee in
which we can pass tax cut proposals that will be signed, not
vetoed, by the president,'' Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn became renowned as a GOP fund-raiser during the 1980s as
Washington state Republican chairman.
</P>
<P>
   She was also a strong conservative and Reagan loyalist who named
one of her sons for the former president. Dunn was the object of a
famous blooper by Reagan, when at a 1986 Spokane rally he
identified the GOP chairwoman as ``Dunn Jennifer.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn was elected to Congress in 1992. After women voters
rejected GOP presidential candidate Bob Dole in 1996, she helped
organize an extensive Republican study on how to win back women's
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have carried Washington in the 1988, 1992 and 1996
presidential elections. But Bush has made five visits to the state,
and held a five-point lead over Vice President Al Gore in a
Democrat-sponsored poll made public this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have turned,'' Dunn said Thursday.

COSTAS HAS MUCH TO SAY IN NEW BOOK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the end of 2000, Bob Costas will have packed a decade's worth
of work into the first year of a new century. There was his NBA
season work that concluded with him seeing almost as many Laker
games as Chick Hearn, and then Tuesday's All-Star date in Atlanta
on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   That will be followed by two months of Olympic study leading
into his 16 Days of Gory as NBC's prime time anchor during the 2000
Summer Olympics in Australia, and then back to the ballpark for
NBC's post season baseball coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But the ironic reality for Costas is that his best work of 2000
comes along another media avenue. His book ``Fair Ball: A Fan's
Case for Baseball,'' made the top ten on the New York Times book
list, among others, and it's been widely hailed as a well-written
prescription for some of the things that ail baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the book came from two sources. The issues he
wanted to talk about were too large for him to work between innings
of game telecasts or even as a guest on longer form radio and TV
shows. ``You can't flesh out some of these issues during a game,
nor should you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also had his fill of being characterized as a traditionalist
or purist -- a niche now considered as avant garde as a AARP
meeting, octogenarian division -- and having his comments
automatically categorized as the ranting of a baseball nut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to collect all this in one place where I could get
some ideas out there and leave no misunderstandings regharding what
they are,'' said Costas. ``Tradition is important, and it is more
important to baseball than any other sport. But it has too often
been characterized as keeping baseball the way it is, or was.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That's not the point, or at least not his.
</P>
<P>
   The quick read (177 pages) touches a lot of points, but one
suggestion he makes stands tallest. At a time when one team can
near a $100 million salary roster and another can barely top out at
$10 million, Costas offers a revenue-redirecting concept that makes
sense.
</P>
<P>
   He believes teams should share their local TV revenue for games
they play on the road. Imagine how it would even out the financial
structure of the game if the Yankees, Cubs and Braves -- three
perfect examples -- had to share their TV revenue whenever they
play in Minnesota, Milwaukee and Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   It's a common sense solution that incorporates an established
revenue source that all teams want to keep growing. Two principals
of the NFL's success is a sharing of gate receipts and equal
sharing in TV revenue. It certainly beats the concept of a luxury
tax that forces the rich franchises to tithe to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic idea is to help balance the playing field so
everyone has a chance,'' Costas said. ``Not even necessarily an
equal chance, but at least a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can look back at baseball and see a time when teams like
Kansas City, Pittsburgh, Oakland, Minnesota and Cincinnati had a
chance, because they did win. But in the last six years or so,
things have changed to where there are a half-dozen teams with
absolutely no chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Costas said the response has been heartening. He's heard from
owners of large-market teams that think it's a good idea as well as
some baseball front office people. But officially, baseball has no
comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they haven't had time to digest the ideas, or just don't
care,'' he said. ``A few people said it makes sense, and therefore
it will never happen, which is a pretty strong indictment of what's
troubling baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``My way is not the only way. Maybe someone within baseball has
a better idea. I just feel we've got to do something. The best
thing about the book is that I've had my say. I've had a chance to
state my case without someone else distorting the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   And now the news: Costas will work the All-Star Game Tuesday (5
p.m.) with Joe Morgan ... ESPN has the Home Run Derby (5 p.m.) and
Celebrity Hitting Challenge ( 7 p.m.) on Monday ... Fox will air
both games of Saturday's ultra rare Yankees-Mets day-night, two
stadium doubleheader, but L.A. will just see half of it. Fox has
the early game at Shea at 10 a.m. -- not seen here because we'll
get the Angels-Rockies at 1 p.m.) -- and Fx the game at Yankee
Stadium at 5 p.m. ), and FX ... ESPN Classic has announced relaunch
effective July 10. One part of the ``relaunch'' is the addition of
segments from ESPN's award-winning SportsCentury top 50 athletes
series, usually as part of theme packages. There will also be a
nightly rerun of a classic ``Up Close'' segment with Roy Firestone
... Advanced programming note: HBO's ``When It Was a Game III''
airs on July 17 (10 p.m.) ... Fox Sports Net and Broadband Sports
have entered into an agreement to produce 26 episodes of a new
series entitles ``Beyond the Game.'' The hook here is that each
show will feature fresh interviews and never-before-available
footage. AthletesDirect.com is a division of Broadband Sports, and
the company has been stockpiling original content for several
years.
</P>
<P>
   The world according to me: Fox's new Regional Sports Report has
been on the air a week now, and it hasn't shown much improvement in
content or changing its ``we'' philosophy. Word is a representative
of former KTLA sports anchor Eddie Arnold, who knows all of the key
L.A. Sports people well, sought an interview for his client and
couldn't even get a call back ... NBC happily reports that it will
make around a $200 million profit on its telecast of the 2000
Olympic Games. Gee, with all this largesse, maybe NBC could share
the wealth with viewers and AIR AN EVENT OR TWO LIVE instead of
airing all 441 hours of coverage on three networks on a delayed
basis. &QL;

PLEA BARGAIN EYED IN PROBE OF CAMPAIGN DONATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Negotiations have intensified between federal
prosecutors and lawyers for James T. Riady, a friend of President
Clinton and a prominent Indonesian businessman whose large campaign
donations to Democrats have been scrutinized by investigators,
government officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After talks with the Justice Department's chief
political-finance prosecutor, Robert J. Conrad Jr., Riady has been
under pressure in recent days to accept a plea bargain, the
officials said. Conrad has been investigating Riady's activities in
connection with contributions made by employees of Lippo Group, the
Riady family conglomerate, in the 1992 and 1994 campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether Conrad has insisted that Riady plead
guilty to a felony or whether he might accept a lesser charge and
settle the case without a trial. But, the officials said, Riady is
unlikely to accept any deal unless it includes a provision that
would spare him a prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Riady's defense lawyer, Abbe D. Lowell, would not comment on the
matter Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation of Riady heated up after John Huang, a
Democratic fund-raiser and former Lippo employee with close ties to
Riady, was sentenced in August 1999 to a year of probation in
exchange for his cooperation in the inquiry. Huang pleaded guilty
to engaging in a conspiracy to defraud the Federal Election
Commission by arranging for Lippo employees to be reimbursed for
campaign contributions in the 1992 and 1994 campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Huang, in an appearance before a House committee investigating
campaign finance issues, testified that he knew of no wrongdoing by
Clinton or Vice President Al Gore. Huang said Riady told him about
a 10-minute limousine ride that Riady shared with President Clinton
in the 1992 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   During the limousine ride, according to Huang's account, Riady
promised to raise $1 million for the campaign. Huang said Riady
told him that Clinton had been surprised by the offer. Riady had
been a friend of the president since Riady's days as a trainee at a
Little Rock investment bank when Clinton was governor of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Huang recalled Riady saying later that his approach to political
giving was, ``If you are going to do something, don't do it
small.'' Clinton has said that he knew of nothing improper about
the donations made by Riady and other members of his family.
</P>
<P>
   Riady and his wife, Aileen, contributed $520,525 to the
Democrats in 1992, election commission records show. Lippo and its
employees gave the Democrats an additional $115,000 in 1992.
Members of the Riady family also made large donations to state
Democratic parties in 1992.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Later, in September 1994, Clinton, Riady and Huang were seen in
a White House videotape taken at a White House radio address, a
weekly event that important supporters were sometimes invited to
attend. After the address, Clinton is seen conferring with Riady
and Huang. Little can be heard of their conversation, although
Clinton at one point is heard to say, ``important issues,'' and at
another time says, ``I think it will be big.''
</P>
<P>
   In times of trouble, the Riady family stepped in to help other
Clinton associates. After Webster Hubbell left a high-ranking post
at the Justice Department in 1994 in a dispute over billing records
at his former Little Rock law firm, a Riady family company paid
Hubbell a $100,000 consulting fee.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr, the former Whitewater prosecutor, investigated
whether such fees totaling more than $500,000, from several firms,
amounted to payments to buy Hubbell's silence about his knowledge
of the activities of Clinton and his wife, Hillary. Hubbell denied
that the payments were hush money.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Riady told an interviewer that he had tired
of the life of a high-flying entrepreneur and longed for a quieter
life in school or at a Christian ministry. In the interview with
Asia Inc. magazine, he said the Asian financial crisis had been a
trying experience because of bank runs and riots in Indonesia in
which one of the family's shopping malls was set on fire.

MICHELS' MOTOR MIGHT BE MARKED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM HADDOCK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There's a rule in NASCAR Grand American Modified
racing at Irwindale Speedway that says any car finishing on the
lead lap of a feature race can claim the motor of any driver
finishing in the top four.
</P>
<P>
   After Rip Michels of Mission Hills won his fifth race in a row
Saturday night, he should be worried that someone might actually
put that rule to use.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrations are already running high. After the Grand Am trophy
dash, which Michels won as well, rival driver Dean Kuhn of
Oceanside made an aggressive dive to cut off Michels and beat him
to pit row. Maybe Kuhn was just trying to beat Michels at
something.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the pits, other drivers were hinting, some even
teasing, that they might claim Michels' motor one night.
</P>
<P>
   But Michels takes the teasing and the talk in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't worry about it,'' Michels said. ``And I assume it will
happen at the end of every race.''
</P>
<P>
   Michels said it already happened to him once. While racing at
Mesa Marin in Bakersfield, a fellow Grand Am driver claimed his
motor after a race. In accordance with the rule, Michels got the
other's driver motor and $750 in exchange for his motor. The next
race, Michels said, he had little problem finding and passing that
other driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a weird deal, but it works,'' Michels said. ``It keeps us
from spending too much.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the bottom line for the rule: to keep teams and drivers
from putting tens of thousands of dollars into an engine and
blowing everyone else away. With the possibility of losing an
engine at the end of every race, the teams and drivers try to make
competitive engines without breaking the bank.
</P>
<P>
   On average, a Grand Am Modified engine can run from $4,000 to
$6,000. A NASCAR Late Model engine costs around $10,000. And some
of the Super Late Model engines can run higher than $20,000. As a
result, teams that want to spend $10,000 or $20,000 on an engine
move up in class rather than risk losing it at the Grand Am level.
</P>
<P>
   So in a class that seems to have found a way to self-police its
competitiveness, how can Michels have five wins in a row and
dominate the division?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never done that before,'' Michels said about winning five
straight. ``Everything is clicking. Everything is going our way.
And my wife's birthday (which was Saturday night) - that's
incentive, too.''
</P>
<P>
   More domination: Another driver dominating his division at
Irwindale Speedway is NASCAR Super Stock driver T.K. Karvasek of
North Hills. He has six wins in nine features this year, but trails
Long Beach's Jeff Green in the points race.
</P>
<P>
   Green, who finished second Saturday night to Karvasek, has won
two of the three races in which Karvasek has not won.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun - me and Jeff,'' Karvasek said Saturday night as he
pointed out the rubber ``doughnuts'' on his car from his driver's
side door to his rear fender. ``We bumped there at the end, but it
was unintentional. He's one of the guys I can run clean with. But I
had determination tonight. I had to redeem myself from my poor
finish last time.''
</P>
<P>
   In other action Saturday night at Irwindale Speedway, James
Weston of Goleta won the NASCAR Late Model main and Tom Landreth of
Alta Loma won the Legend Cars main.
</P>
<P>
   Herta recovers: Valencia's Bryan Herta turned in an impressive
run Sunday at the Cleveland Grand Prix. Herta, in only his second
race for Mo Nunn Racing as a substitute driver for the injured Tony
Kanaan, got tangled in an 11-car pileup to start the race and had
to pit early.
</P>
<P>
   Herta returned to the field and eventually led the race on lap
42. He finished the race in ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the top-10 performance, Herta said the last two races
have taken their toll on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not being in a car for five races, and then doing two very
difficult races back-to-back was really hard,'' said Herta, whose
previous race before the Budweiser/G.I. Joe's 200 at Portland on
June 25 was the Rio 200 on April 30. ``I've been running and
working out, but nothing can take the place of seat time to get you
ready for racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kanaan, who suffered a broken arm and ribs in a practice session
before the Portland race, is expected back for the Michigan 500 on
July 23. Morris Nunn, team owner for Mo Nunn Racing, has not made
an announcement as to who will race for the team in the Molson Indy
in Toronto on July 16.
</P>
<P>
   A team representative said there is a possibility Herta or
former CART champion Alex Zanardi could race in Toronto for Mo
Nunn. Zanardi, who left for the Formula One circuit after winning
two CART championships in 1997 and 1998, is testing for Mo Nunn at
Sebring this weekend. Apparently it is up to Zanardi if he wants to
race at Toronto for Mo Nunn.
</P>
<P>
   Featherlite series: Matt Crafton of Tulare added to his points
lead in the NASCAR Featherlite Southwest Series by winning
Saturday's Community Recycling Firecracker 100 at Mesa Marin
Raceway in Bakersfield.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Woodside of Saugus was third, Frank Maronski Jr. of Quartz
Hill was 10th, Greg Pursley of Newhall was 12th and pole winner MK
Kanke of Frazier Park was 19th.
</P>
<P>
   The next race on the Southwest Series is the L.A. Street Race
200 on July 16.

DODGERTOWN AGREEMENT NEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The Los Angeles Dodgers are close to agreeing on a
deal that will keep Dodgertown their spring training home for the
next 20 years, officials familiar with the negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers and representatives from Vero Beach, Fla., and
Indian River County fine-tuned a proposal last week that includes a
major overhaul of Dodgertown, the club's spring training home since
1948. It will include a small town center and renovations to
workout areas and improvements to Holman Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   An announcement could be made by the end of next week, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even see where Las Vegas is an option anymore for the
Dodgers,'' said an official involved in the process. ``I think the
window of opportunity there passed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers insist they remain interested in Las Vegas, but
interest from many of the other clubs involved has dwindled
considerably since Florida Gov. Jeb Bush signed a bill that
allocates as much as $2.5 million per year to spring training
facilities owned by local municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers and Dodgers were made the point teams in the
process of a six-team complex in Las Vegas. The Dodgers would only
do the deal with six teams, but only the Rangers remain excited
about it. Houston, Baltimore, Toronto and Tampa Bay are all
planning on returning to Florida for the long-term, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still actively pursuing our other options, including
Las Vegas,'' Dodgers senior vice president Derrick Hall said.
``We're in contact and continually negotiating with the other teams
involved in Las Vegas, as we continue to deal with the local
government in Florida as we approach a finalized plan.''
</P>
<P>
   It is conceivable Las Vegas could make a late run and overwhelm
the Dodgers, but the chance of that was termed ``a million-to-one
shot'' by an official.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have a hard deadline this month of making a decision
because of the way the funding bill was written in Florida. In
order for sites to get funding, the facility must be owned by the
municipality. The Dodgers own Dodgertown and will sell it back to
Vero Beach and Indian River County and lease it for $1 per year.
</P>
<P>
   Vero Beach and Indian River County have until Oct. 1 to apply
for funding.
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo, Perez drop appeals: Dodgers outfielder F.P.
Santangelo and left-hander Carlos Perez each informed the players
association they were dropping their appeals and will serve their
five-game suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   Perez will begin serving his five-game suspension July 16 and
Santangelo will serve his five-game suspension July 22. The Dodgers
players weren't enthralled with the idea of going to Atlanta to
have their appeals heard by commissioner Bud Selig, but the major
factor in dropping the suspensions was the likelihood Selig would
overturn it.
</P>
<P>
   However, left fielder Gary Sheffield plans to go through with
his appeal of a five-game suspension, which is tentatively set to
be heard Tuesday before the All-Star Game. And the players
association is behind Sheffield and believe he can have his
suspension reduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a great deal of sympathy for Gary,'' said Gene Orza,
associate general counsel of the players association. ``I've
watched the film more after the hearings (June 21) in Houston. The
conclusion that Sheffield was acting as anything more than a
peacemaker is absurd.''

PALESTINIAN INVESTMENT FUND, NO LONGER SECRET, WILL CLOSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank _ After mounting pressure from Western
governments whose philanthropy keeps the Palestinian Authority
afloat, Yasser Arafat's government has divulged details of its
long-hidden investment portfolio, and now says that its next step
will be to dismantle the fund entirely.
</P>
<P>
   The man who has been the keeper of Arafat's investment accounts,
Mohammed Rachid, said in a rare, on-the-record conversation with
journalists here Thursday night that he will preside over the
dissolution of the financial empire he methodically amassed at
Arafat's behest.
</P>
<P>
   Rachid, who had managed to keep himself and the Palestinian
government's business dealings shielded from public scrutiny for
years, pledged that the holdings would either be divested or
transferred to a new, publicly accountable Palestinian Investment
Fund by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   According to an audited statement sent to the International
Monetary Fund in June and published this month on the Palestinian
Authority's Web site, the holding company now boasts assets of $345
million, including $292 million in equity stakes in three dozen
companies. Its one-third share in an Israeli-patronized casino,
valued at $60 million, is its largest and most lucrative
investment.
</P>
<P>
   The liquidation of these holdings will not be entirely
voluntary, Rachid acknowledged Thursday. Western governments had
refused to continue subsidizing Palestinian budget deficits unless
all government revenues and expenditures were consolidated into a
single ``transparent'' budget account, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been hiding information,'' Rachid said. ``Maybe it
wasn't wise.'' But he said that this secrecy was evidence not of
corruption, but of inexperience in public administration and
Arafat's desire to protect profitable investments from his own
free-spending bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a huge difference between monopolies and
corruption,'' Rachid said, adding that it was unrealistic to expect
the emerging Palestinian state to conduct business ``like a small
Switzerland.''
</P>
<P>
   The investments were detailed last month in the audit. In that
report, Rachid's Palestinian Commercial Services Co., which is
owned by the Palestinian Authority but not supervised by its
legislature or finance ministry, was revealed to control large
minority stakes in a Jericho casino, a Ramallah Coca-Cola bottler,
a Bethlehem convention center and myriad other private businesses,
plus full ownership of a cement plant that had long enjoyed a
government-protected monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   The company was also, until recently, the direct recipient of
sales taxes _ more than $500 million in the past two years alone _
collected by Israel but owed to the Palestinian Authority under the
1993 Oslo peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   The tax receipts had been deposited in a Tel Aviv bank account
controlled by Rachid and Arafat, a practice ended by Israel in
April after persistent complaints by the World Bank, the
International Monetary Fund and other institutions charged with
monitoring Palestinian finances. Some of the tax money was used by
Arafat for undisclosed official expenditures, but most went to the
Palestinian Commercial Services Co., according to Palestinian
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the major investments disclosed in the audited report,
like the casino and holdings in luxury hotels and the local
telecommunications monopolies, had been reported unofficially here.
But there were a few unexpected oddities, like small joint
investment funds with the government of Qatar and the Peres Peace
Center, a Tel Aviv foundation started by Shimon Peres, the former
Israeli prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The report also revealed that Rachid's company recently put $9
million into a small biotechnology company in London, Ontario,
Bioniche Life Sciences, its only disclosed investment outside the
Palestinian territories. The Palestinian Authority became the
second largest investor in the closely held Canadian company, and
Rachid, whose wife and children are Canadian citizens, was awarded
a seat on the board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they decided to invest in the London area for personal
reasons,'' a spokeswoman for the Ontario company said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Rachid said Thursday that he has no personal financial interests
in businesses in which his government company invested.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 23 years working with Yasser Arafat, I carefully watch
myself,'' said Rachid, who joined the Palestinian Liberation
Organization while working as a journalist in Beirut. He followed
Arafat to Tunisia and, in 1994, to Gaza, becoming one of his
closest confidantes. Though he has no formal position in the
Palestinian hierarchy, Rachid is part of the 11-member negotiating
team headed for Camp David next week.
</P>
<P>
   Rachid and other Palestinian leaders characterize their budget
reforms as an essential prelude to the independence they hope to
secure in the peace talks. A sovereign Palestinian state will be
able to seek loans from the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund and put up guarantees for commercial bond issues _
but only if its books are in order, they say.

CLINTON PREPARING TO DELAY U.S. EXECUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, N.C., Puerto Rico, Va., N.Y., Md.)   By RAYMOND BONNER and MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration is planning to postpone
the first federal execution in nearly 40 years because of a lack of
clemency procedures and concerns about racial and geographic
disparities in death penalty cases, administration officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is awaiting Justice Department regulations for
death row inmates to follow in seeking clemency from the president.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Raul Garza, who was convicted seven years ago of three
drug-related murders, is scheduled to be executed on Aug. 5, and
his lawyers said Thursday that they would use the new procedures as
soon as they have them to ask President Clinton to spare Garza's
life.
</P>
<P>
   The department is also finishing a report on whether members of
racial minorities or defendants in certain parts of the country are
more likely to face the federal death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Data gathered so far by the Justice Department shows that
members of minorities make up more than three-quarters of the
defendants in federal capital cases and that federal prosecutors in
five districts, including two in New York, have filed nearly half
of the federal cases in which the death penalty was an option,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department report, to be released later this month,
is certain to generate questions about the fairness of the federal
death penalty beyond the Garza case, which would be the first
federal execution since John F. Kennedy was president, officials
said. There are currently 21 men who face the death penalty for
federal crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The new clemency procedures, the first in federal capital cases
since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988, should be
completed within a week or two, a Justice Department spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   They will allow for the death row inmate's lawyer to make an
oral presentation to a clemency panel, and the process, from filing
to final decision, will take at least 90 days, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official said Garza, who was convicted in 1993 in
Brownsville, Texas, would be allowed to take advantage of the new
procedures. Thus, his execution will have to be postponed,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department spokesman said the department had no
authority to grant a reprieve to Garza at this time, and that the
sole power for such a reprieve now lay with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Constitution, the president's pardon powers are
absolute. Thus, options in the Garza case include a pardon, which
would erase the criminal record, commutation to a life sentence or
a temporary reprieve, which would allow Garza to follow the new
clemency procedures. A 90-day reprieve would put off the execution
until after the election, one official noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're cautiously optimistic,'' said Garza's lawyer, Gregory W.
Wiercioch of the Texas Defender Service in Houston. Wiercioch added
that he had not been given official notice of any reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until then, we have to move forward on other fronts,'' he
said. Wiercioch was in Washington Thursday looking for support for
his client.
</P>
<P>
   Garza has had his hopes dashed before. When Judge Filemon B.
Vela of U.S. District Court first proposed setting an August
execution date, U.S. Attorney Mervyn M. Mossbacker Jr. joined the
defense in asking that he not do so. Noting that it would be the
first federal execution in more than three decades, Mossbacker said
the Justice Department was developing guidelines and procedures to
ensure that it would be carried out ``in an appropriate, dignified
and expeditious manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Although declaring that he was ``not a proponent of the death
penalty,'' Vela rejected the arguments and set the date, after
which the U.S. attorney dropped further opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Garza, a high school dropout who is the son of migrant farm
workers, was the head of a drug-running operation that smuggled in
tons of marijuana from Mexico, according to the federal charges. He
was convicted of ordering the execution of three people as part of
his criminal enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Although Garza has declared that he was not responsible for the
murders, his lawyers, in seeking clemency, do not intend to argue
that he is innocent. Rather, they will argue that it is unfair to
put Garza to death because the federal death penalty system, as it
currently operates, discriminates against members of minorities and
is unevenly applied across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The administration of the federal death penalty is like a
``rigged lottery,'' with the outcome determined by ``the color of
your skin and where you purchased your ticket,'' Wiercioch said.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference last week, Clinton said he was concerned
about ``the disturbing racial composition'' of the federal death
penalty population, and that a handful of federal districts account
for the majority of death penalty cases, ``which raises the
question of whether, even though there is a uniform law across the
country, what your prosecution is may turn solely on where you
committed the crime.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Clinton said, he had asked the Justice Department
to undertake a review.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court declared in 1972 that the death penalty as it
was then applied was unconstitutional. In 1988, Congress enacted
legislation that allowed prosecutors to seek the death penalty for
certain crimes. It was first applied to drug-related crimes, in
what has become known as the ``drug kingpin statute.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of his political career, Clinton has been a
stalwart backer of the death penalty. In his 1992 campaign,
Clinton, then governor of Arkansas, interrupted his campaign to
deny clemency to two inmates who subsequently were executed by
lethal injection. As president, he signed legislation in 1994 that
expanded the federal death penalty to about 60 crimes. Two years
later, after the Oklahoma City bombing, he backed a law
streamlining the appeals process, which applied to both state and
federal prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one men have a death sentence hanging over them, said the
Federal Death Penalty Resource Project, an organization in
Columbia, S.C., that opposes the death penalty. Fourteen are
African-American, three are Hispanic, one is Asian and three are
white, including Timothy McVeigh, who was convicted in the Oklahoma
City bombings.
</P>
<P>
   With most of these men having only recently exhausted all their
appeals, the Justice Department has not been under pressure to
adopt federal rules for clemency, which is an inmate's last hope
after all the courts have spoken. Even without formal procedures,
however, federal inmates are able to petition the president for
redress.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. attorney needs the approval of the attorney general
before seeking the death penalty, and Attorney General Janet Reno
has instituted a formal procedure for federal prosecutors to follow
in seeking that approval.
</P>
<P>
   In a case in which the death penalty is an option, the
prosecutor is required to send a memorandum to the Justice
Department, with a recommendation on whether or not it should be
sought. A committee set up by Reno then reviews the file and makes
a recommendation to her.
</P>
<P>
   A defendant's lawyer is allowed to make a presentation to the
federal prosecutor before the government seeks the death penalty,
and then to the Justice Department review committee, two levels of
protection that do not exist for a defendant in state capital
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Going back to 1988, the attorney general has authorized the
death penalty against 199 defendants, according to the death
penalty project. Three-fourths of these defendants have been
members of minority groups, with 103 of them African-Americans, the
project said.
</P>
<P>
   A former member of the death penalty review committee, Rory K.
Little, has described Reno's death-penalty case review system as
``consciously race-blind.''
</P>
<P>
   The racial disparities creep into the system, said Little, who
now teaches at Hastings College of Law in San Francisco, because of
the wide discretion given to federal prosecutors. They decided in
the first instance whether to charge a defendant with a crime that
carries the death penalty and then whether to plea bargain for a
life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   This same discretion explains the geographic disparities in the
system, he said. A chart published by Little in a law review
article showed that for the years 1995 through 1998, U.S. attorneys
submitted 471 death penalty cases to the Justice Department for
review. Slightly more than 200 were from five judicial districts.
Puerto Rico was at the top, with 59 submissions; the Eastern
District of Virginia followed, with 52; the Eastern District of New
York, 42; the Southern District of New York, 30, and Maryland, 24.
</P>
<P>
   A Clinton administration official said that the numbers would be
updated in the department's current report, but that the five
districts still led in death penalty cases.

GAO REPORT SAYS CORRUPTION IS STIFLING BOSNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS with CARLOTTA GALL  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pervasive crime and corruption are blocking the
success of the Dayton peace accord in Bosnia, and the Clinton
administration should consider suspending its extensive aid until
local authorities show a determination to fight such abuses, a
General Accounting Office report concludes.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the investigative arm of Congress found that the
failure of local authorities to curb graft, organized crime and
other abuses could interfere with the eventual withdrawal of U.S.
and other NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   According to a draft copy of the report obtained by The New York
Times, top U.S. and international officials asserted that ``there
has been no measurable progress in reducing crime and corruption in
the four years since the end of the war.'' The final report is to
be released to lawmakers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Bosnia, the report said, ``have not demonstrated
a desire to eliminate corruption and develop a society based on the
rule of law.'' Despite international efforts to establish a
functioning legal system, ``the Bosnians have chosen not to
cooperate,'' opting instead to create ineffective committees, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO said it would recommend that Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright consider suspending additional monetary
assistance until local governments demonstrate the willingness and
ability to crack down.
</P>
<P>
   The report's findings come while there is wide skepticism in
Congress about the progress of the international effort to rebuild
a self-sustaining, multiethnic Bosnia based on the Dayton Peace
Agreement, which was signed by Croatia, Yugoslavia and Bosnia's
three major ethnic groups in December 1995. The report may also be
seen as having implications for U.S. involvement in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The report states that Congress may wish to condition future
U.S. assistance on State Department certification that the Bosnian
government has taken measurable steps to fight corruption, control
smuggling and reduce tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This GAO report on Bosnia reveals that crime and corruption
are so endemic at all levels of the Bosnian society that our goals
_ and those of the entire international community _ in Bosnia
cannot be achieved until we confront this problem head on,'' said
Rep. Benjamin A. Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman of the House
International Relations Committee.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   By last December, the United States, the European Union and
other donors had committed more than $4 billion to help reconstruct
Bosnia after a war that killed more than 250,000 people and forced
2.3 million from their homes, according to international estimates.
President Clinton has requested over $100 million for assistance to
Bosnia in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that the United States has not recovered nearly
$900,000 in operating funds for the U.S. Embassy and loan payments
it had deposited in a Bosnian bank, BH Banka, which was involved in
illegal activity.
</P>
<P>
   And the World Bank lost $500,000 in 1997 in a sophisticated
fraud scheme involving false government procurement documents, the
report said. Three years later, no arrests have been made, the
report added.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia's presidency rotates among its three prominent ethnic
groups _ Muslim, Croat and Serb. Two members of the presidency are
elected from the Muslim-Croat Federation and one from Republika
Srpska, the two entities of today's Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO found no evidence that U.S. or other international aid
is ``being lost to large-scale fraud or corruption.'' But it
asserted that Bosnian authorities may be using the foreign
donations to make up for income the government has lost to crime.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnian officials have failed to collect ``hundreds of millions
of dollars'' in income tax, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding a less dire note, foreign diplomats and aid officials
in Bosnia asserted that economic and judicial reforms take time.
While they note that they are powerless to crack down on abuses
themselves, they insist that there are stringent safeguards to
protect foreign aid and that additional financing is contingent on
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all being extremely careful now,'' said Wilhelm Schmid,
the Swiss ambassador to Bosnia, whose nation has tightened its
controls on budgetary support. ``It would be unfortunate to stop
help for the needy because of the criminal activities of a few.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said Thursday that they have not not
seen a final version of the report. But a White House spokesman
said the U.S. investment, including the open-ended deployment of
about 4,300 troops, is helping Bosnia to ``rise above these
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our presence in Bosnia helps build a stronger civil society,
including respect for the rule of law and greater transparency in
government,'' said the spokesman, P.J. Crowley. ``Where we have
seen evidence of corruption, we have worked with the international
community to take appropriate action.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowley said the administration would decide whether to maintain
troops in Bosnia ``based on what needs to be done, as opposed to an
arbitrary pullout date.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Dayton agreement, NATO forces are to be withdrawn only
after progress in reducing corruption and organized crime,
including the elimination of illegal institutions, the creation of
a democratic law enforcement system and judicial reform.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO cited shortcomings in each of those areas, denouncing
bribe-taking local bosses of political parties, police officers in
the service of business interests who intimidate citizens or return
refugees, and an underground economy that accounts for about half
of Bosnia's entire economic output.

A SELECT GROUP SPEAKS OUT ON THE DEMOCRATIC PLATFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The Democratic Party opened public hearings on its
platform here Thursday with a tightly scripted display of party
unity, hearing from a parade of witnesses who endorsed Vice
President Al Gore's positions on almost every major campaign issue,
like gun control, the economy, health care, education and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   The daylong hearing provided further evidence that Gore, who
easily defeated former Sen. Bill Bradley in the primaries, will not
face the kind of bitter policy divisions that have bedeviled
Democratic presidential nominees of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials intend to release a draft of the platform
on Friday. And they made it clear that they expected it to be a
clear articulation of Gore's vision rather than the kind of
ideological treatise he might feel compelled to run away from.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that much of this is straight out of what he has
already had to say, what he has already proposed,'' Gov. James B.
Hunt Jr. of North Carolina, chairman of the platform drafting
committee, said Thursday. ``And I think he can run on it and win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are hoping that their unified front will give them
the appearance of greater party strength than the Republicans,
whose platform meetings continue to provide a forum for fierce
debate over abortion.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the trade issue was widely expected to be the
Democrats' platform equivalent of abortion. Many trade unions and
environmentalists, major components of the Democratic base, have
opposed the Clinton administration's position on global trade,
arguing that it has hurt the environment and siphoned jobs away
from American workers.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, trade was rarely mentioned. The one person
expected to raise the issue, Alan Reuther, legislative director for
the United Automobile Workers, did not show up. Democratic
officials said Reuther had a scheduling conflict.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few discordant notes was sounded by Amy Isaacs,
national director of Americans for Democratic Action, a liberal
group. Speaking on the trade issue, Isaacs said, ``Granting China
permanent normal trade relations is a step in the wrong direction,
we believe. As a nation, we must state clearly that profits over
people is untenable.''
</P>
<P>
   Isaacs added that ``liberals in the country are very uneasy''
with the nation's political drift. And she urged the people writing
the Democratic platform not to blur the distinctions between the
two major parties, a criticism often leveled at the Democrats by
Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Leigh Blek, a registered Republican from Orange County,
Calif., who helped organize the Million Mom March for gun control
earlier this year, typified their tone. Blek, without explicitly
endorsing Gore, complained that the leadership of the Republican
Party had not heard the voices of mothers who want stronger gun
laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think in November, they are going to hear it,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials said the committee was likely to face some
policy debates behind closed doors Thursday night as they hammered
out the final draft. For instance, labor officials are pushing for
stronger language defending the rights of workers to form unions.
They also want a clearer pledge of support for trade agreements
that protect the environment and workers' rights.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the committee are also expected to push for a
more sweeping declaration of the party's support for ending
discrimination against gays and lesbians and a more powerful
condemnation of racially motivated violence.
</P>
<P>
   But those debates are expected play out on the fringes, not at
the heart, of the 10,000- to 20,000-word document.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looking for a fight here at all,'' said Gerry Shea,
a top official with the AFL-CIO, who is on the platform drafting
committee.

AMTRAK IS OFFERING EVERY DISSATISFIED RIDER A FREE TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: SUBS 8th graf, Amtrak estimates ..., to correct 2nd sentence,
if amtrak can `reduce' rate by 1 percentage point, sted `raise'
rate.) 
By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Amtrak said Thursday that it would offer every
dissatisfied customer a free repeat trip, even if the problem was
not the railroad's fault.
</P>
<P>
   The new program is part of its campaign to build ridership and
revenues by reducing the number of disgruntled passengers, before
Congress cuts off operating subsidies in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``This grabs people's attention in the marketplace,'' said
George Warrington, president of Amtrak, who added that no other
national carrier had offered a similar program. This one is
retroactive to July 4.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak's reputation among potential passengers has historically
been poor, Warrington acknowledged, because of trains that are late
or in poor condition. He said the new program was intended to
demonstrate ``Amtrak's ability, desire and fixation about putting
guests at the center of everything we do.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also revealed a new logo, to replace the ``pointless
arrow,'' as it is known, that has served for the last 29 years. The
company plans to redesign waiting rooms, ticket booths, platform
displays and schedules themselves, to match.
</P>
<P>
   To exercise the new guarantee, Amtrak is asking its customers to
call their complaints to the attention of any employee. If the
employee cannot solve the problem Amtrak will issue coupons for
repeat travel.
</P>
<P>
   The company anticipates, for example, issuing coupons to people
for a problem with a seat or a sleeping compartment or to entire
train loads of passengers if a train is extremely late. Amtrak
promises to provide the free ride coupon even if the problem is an
ice storm, or derailment of another train. ``Regardless of fault,
in the end, it's Amtrak that's responsible,'' Warrington said
during a meeting with reporters Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak estimates that for every 100 people who try the railroad
for the first time, 15 percent never ride again. If Amtrak can
reduce that rate by 1 percentage point, its revenues would rise by
$13 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The railroad has also trained on-board personnel to help
passengers if a train is going to be late, by telephoning ahead to
relatives who were planning to pick them up at the station, for
example, or re-booking connections and hotel accommodations.
Company officials said they were taking cues from what travelers
expect from airlines under similar circumstances.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For the last three years Amtrak has been offering a similar
satisfaction guarantee on a single train, the Coast Starlight,
which runs daily in each direction between Seattle and Los Angeles,
and has issued one coupon good for a free trip for each 107,000
passengers, Warrington said.
</P>
<P>
   But the railroad expects a much higher rate of complaints and
refunds on other trains. It has told its 25,000 employees that if
the rate of complaints runs better than one in 1,000 trips during
any month, each of them will get a bonus for that month equal to
the average price of an Amtrak ticket, which is now $50.
</P>
<P>
   The railroad said that ridership was up 7 percent in the last
four months compared with the previous year and that in June, for
the first time, it had revenues of $100 million.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Passenger loads on its four daily all-electric ``Acela
Regional'' trains running between Washington and Boston are up 40
percent over the older trains they replaced, the railroad said.
</P>
<P>
   The railroad intends to introduce its high-speed Acela service,
with a top speed of 150 mph, later this summer. That had been
scheduled for last year, but problems were found in testing.

NEW YORK'S STREET OF AUTOMOTIVE DREAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID W. DUNLAP   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; NEW YORK _ Given New York's hate-hate relationship with motor
vehicles _ on the one hand, their numbers and bulk make the streets
impassable; on the other hand, their fumes and noise foul the
atmosphere _ it is hard to imagine a day when mid-Manhattan was the
automotive Acropolis of America.
</P>
<P>
   But there was such a time, and there was such a place:
Automobile Row, a one-and-a-half mile stretch of Broadway from the
40s to the 70s, lined with car makers, tire companies and
dealerships by the dozens. Bedazzled buyers could find the ``Three
P's'' of luxury motoring _ Packard, Peerless and Pierce (makers of
the Arrow) _ jostling for attention with Babcock Electrics and
White Steamers, Hupmobiles, Loziers, Overlands, Reos and
Speedwells.
</P>
<P>
   ``In great halls of baronial aspect, on Oriental rugs and marble
floors, under little whispering galleries where the salesmen retire
to their orisons, America's most shining triumphs are displayed,''
Christopher Morley wrote in his 1923 essay ``Round Columbus
Circle.''
</P>
<P>
   The salesmen _ and the prayers they offered _ have long since
vanished. but much of Automobile Row remains. It is simply hiding
in plain sight, like so much of New York history.
</P>
<P>
   Though the last dealer decamped to 11th Avenue in 1985, many
architectural monuments of Manhattan's automotive history can still
be seen: buildings by masters like Carrere &AMP; Hastings, Shreve &AMP;
Lamb, Albert Kahn, Francis Hatch Kimball, William Welles Bosworth
and Howard Van Doren Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   One small treasure of Automobile Row, the 92-year-old former
Goelet Garage at the northeast corner of 64th Street, is headed for
the scrap heap. The six-story loft building, now known as 1926
Broadway, is to be demolished next year and replaced by a 29-story
apartment tower.
</P>
<P>
   Admirers of the Goelet building, which is distinguished by broad
window bays intricately framed in white terra cotta, had urged its
designation as a landmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word garage does not adequately describe how this building
originally functioned,'' the preservationist Christopher W. London
wrote in a recent historical analysis of 1926 Broadway. Instead, he
said, it was a ``select emporium engaged principally in the
exclusive manufacture, repair, service and sales of this recently
developed, fashionable technological tool.'' Before automobiles
were mass-produced on assembly lines, London noted, they were more
painstakingly constructed in small-scale ``boutique'' shops, like
the coaches they supplanted.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Landmarks Preservation Commission declined to
designate the Goelet Garage. But several automotive buildings south
of Columbus Circle are to be considered for landmark status,
beginning with the former United States Rubber Co. Building, now
known as 1790 Broadway, at the southeast corner of 58th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer J. Raab, the chairwoman of the commission, said the
study of the Goelet Garage had ``focused us on the importance of
automobiles in the history of the city and motivated us to ensure
the protection of the important icons of the industry while they're
still intact.''
</P>
<P>
   Automobile Row succeeded the carriage-and-harness district
around Longacre Square, as Times Square was called in the 19th
century. Every so often, startling reminders come to light. Two
years ago, for instance, the demolition of a building at Broadway
and 47th Street revealed a jumbo hand-painted sign on an adjacent
wall for ``J.A. Keal's Carriage Manufactory.''
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1900s, Automobile Row was a kind of proto-Silicon
Alley, a jumble of hungry entrepreneurs peddling an emerging
technology in a bewildering variety of forms to a credulous _ and
growing _ public.
</P>
<P>
   Embodying the transition from horse-drawn to horseless
transportation is the former Studebaker Building, 1600 Broadway, on
the northeast corner of 48th Street. Built in 1902 and designed by
James Brown Lord, it was a 10-story factory and office for the
Studebaker Brothers Co., makers of automobiles, carriages and
wagons.
</P>
<P>
   In 1909, Studebaker held what it called the ``most comprehensive
exhibit of motorcars ever shown by any one maker'' in its
salesroom: seven-passenger touring cars, suburbans, roadsters,
runabouts, coupes, limousines, landaulets, ambulances, delivery
wagons, 10-ton trucks and ``electric pleasure vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   Studebaker moved uptown in 1911 and went out of business in
1966. Its old showroom is now the Texas Texas restaurant. Even
though the red-brick building lost its cornice 12 years ago, it is
still a solid presence on Times Square, with chamfered corners and
broad arched windows.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE FORD REIGNED
</P>
<P>
   Proceeding uptown on Broadway _ something best done on foot _
the next milestone is the handsome former Ford Motor Co. Building
on the northeast corner of 54th Street. It is now the headquarters
of UNITE, the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile
Employees. A branch of the Amalgamated Bank, which the union owns,
occupies the former Ford showroom.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1917, the six-story Ford Building was designed by
Albert Kahn, arguably the foremost American industrial architect of
the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Its red-tile hipped roof brings an unexpectedly Mediterranean
touch to the Broadway canyon, while its crisply linear limestone
facade is enlivened by fluted spandrel panels with classical
escutcheons set into recessed window bays. The building is related
aesthetically to an engineering laboratory in Dearborn, Mich., that
Kahn designed for Ford eight years later.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of World War II, when civilian automobile
production had stopped and gasoline and tires were being rationed,
Ford sold its building to the International Ladies Garment Workers
Union, the forerunner of UNITE, which was headed by David Dubinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Ford left behind a 10-by-20-foot automobile-size elevator _
larger than some studio apartments in Manhattan _ and matching
curved nine-foot Art Deco desks made for Henry Ford and his son,
Edsel, who was president of the company until his death in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   The delicious paradox of a labor organization's occupying a
deluxe structure built by a famously anti-union company was not
lost on Dubinsky or anyone around him, including the young Jay
Mazur, who grew up in the ILG and is now president of UNITE. In
fact, Mazur said, Dubinsky happily appropriated the Fords' custom
furniture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made sure that people knew this was Ford's building,''
Mazur recalled with undiminished gusto. ``Dubinsky used to say:
`See? I'm sitting at Edsel Ford's desk!' For him, it was a badge of
honor that he could show the world, that his union was part of the
establishment.''

RULING COULD MEAN `MILLIONS' TO TEXAS INDIAN NATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JAMES KIMBERLY 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ As American Indian nations go, the Alabama and
Coushatta probably have one of the smallest on the map.
</P>
<P>
   Just half of the tribe's 1,012 citizens live on a 4,600-acre
reservation two hours northeast of Houston off U.S. 59.
</P>
<P>
   But it could be bigger. In fact, according to a recent federal
court ruling, it should be much, much bigger.
</P>
<P>
   After 17 years of litigation, a three-judge panel of the U.S.
Court of Claims finally ruled that 2.8 million acres of East Texas
pine forest was stolen from the Alabama and Coushatta Indians by
European settlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ruling was very important to the nation,'' tribal
administrator Joseph Bergen said. ``They were elated.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is about much more than patriotism and bragging rights.
The split decision by the court also cited the U.S. government for
failing to protect the Indians' rights.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Justice Department asks the court to reconsider its
ruling, as it did in a 1996 decision, the court now will decide how
much money the Indians should be compensated for the lost land.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is currently reviewing the court of
claims opinion and hasn't decided whether it will ask the court to
reconsider, said Patricia Weiss, an attorney with the federal
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the tribe _ and there are six of record _ said the
Alabama and Coushatta will ask the court to reimburse them for
timber, oil, natural gas and land they never got to sell in a vast
tract from the Louisiana border to north of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have experts calculating those figures,'' said Austin
Attorney Alan Minter. ``It's potentially a huge sum. I don't know
how large yet. It is into the millions.''
</P>
<P>
   If other similar cases are any indication, it could be many
millions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the Catawba Indians settled their land dispute claim
against the federal government and South Carolina for $90 million,
according the Boulder, Colo.-based Native American Rights Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Federal, state and local governments put $50 million in trust
funds to pay for land acquisition, economic development, elder care
and individual payments to tribe members. The remainder of the
settlement came in the form of services and in-kind contributions
from federal and local units of government.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 20 years, the government has settled about a dozen
similar claims, said Don Miller, lead counsel for the Alabama and
Coushatta and an attorney with the Native American Rights Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The crux of the Alabama and Coushatta lawsuit can be found in
federal common law recognition of aboriginal land rights.
</P>
<P>
   The rights are established by the long-term and exclusive use of
a piece of land by a native people. In this case, it is the Alabama
and Coushatta tribe, which migrated from what is now Alabama and
Mississippi around the time of the Revolutionary War, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Those aboriginal land rights can be extinguished only by an act
of Congress, either through a treaty with the tribe or a simple
resolution. Neither was done with the Alabama and Coushatta, Miller
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Indians' ownership rights were never severed, the
federal government had a duty to protect them, the court of claims
found.
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, Congress turned over trusteeship of the tribe to the
state of Texas. The key issue in the case is what the tribe is owed
for those 109 years from 1845, when Texas became a state, until
1954 when the federal government should have been protecting the
tribe's rights but wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said the claims court ruling gives the tribe strong legal
and moral grounds for demanding compensation from the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a recognition of the fact that this was Indian
land wrongfully taken away and it puts the burden squarely on the
federal government and the state of Texas to make things right,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   It may be some time still before any such compensation is paid.
Unless Congress decides to settle the case, the amount of money
owed the tribe also must be litigated before the court of claims.
The court's decisions then must be forwarded to Congress for
action.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he is confident that the Alabama and Coushatta will
get some compensation.
</P>
<P>
   It was a 1983 special resolution of the U.S. House of
Representatives that enabled the tribe to file the lawsuit in the
first place, so it is unlikely Congress would just ignore the
court's findings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've never ignored one before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the tribe is forced to wait a long time for a final answer to
the dispute, they are well practiced for it. The Alabama and
Coushatta began their quest for recognition of land rights before
the now-defunct Indian Claims Commission in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   A court ruling bumped their claim from the commission in 1972,
and they spent the next 11 years lobbying for the special
resolution so they could file their lawsuit, Minter said.
</P>
<P>
   The Alabama and Coushatta are hoping they will be compensated
for the land. The tribe is in such need of money that it is
considering opening a casino on its reservation _ a move that would
surely drag it into a fight with the state of Texas, which
prohibits gaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see any reason why we can't negotiate a settlement of
this case,'' said Morris Bullock, chairman of the tribal council.
``It's gone on too long already.''

NEW YORK: the establishment.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today, Ford owns another Kahn building, 787 11th Ave., between
54th and 55th Streets, completed in 1929 as the Packard Motor Car
Co. Service Building. The massiveness of this eight-story
industrial structure is relieved by vaguely Mayan gargoyles along
the parapet, giant rosettes and fluted pilasters. It is a
one-and-a-half-mile detour from the Broadway itinerary, but you can
always buy a car while you're there.
</P>
<P>
   A much shorter detour takes you to the former home of the
Automobile Club of America at 250 West 55th Street, a 12-story
buff-brick building just west of Broadway. Within an ornamental
niche above the second story, the legend ``ACA 1910'' can still be
faintly discerned.
</P>
<P>
   This structure was an annex to a far more sumptuous eight-story
clubhouse at 247 W. 54th St., built in 1907 and designed by Ernest
Flagg, the architect of the Scribner Building at 597 Fifth Avenue.
(The club moved out long ago, and the Beaux-Arts facade was
replaced by plain white brick. The structure is now the state Labor
Department Community Service Center.)
</P>
<P>
   Besides garage space for 350 cars, the Automobile Club offered
its members a 100-foot-long assembly hall modeled on the Chateau de
Cheverny in France; a grill room that could feed 300 hungry
motorists at a time; a billiard hall; a library; and accommodations
for chauffeurs. The 55th Street annex had space for 600 more cars
and a restaurant, barber shop and Turkish baths.
</P>
<P>
   The organization is now the Automobile Club of New York, an
affiliate of AAA, with headquarters in Garden City. But it
maintains a travel agency at 1881 Broadway, which was once the
Walter C. Martin Cadillac dealership. This Triple A branch on the
northwest corner of 62nd Street may be the last functioning vestige
of Automobile Row.
</P>
<P>
   Down 54th Street from the old Automobile Club is a nondescript
two-story structure at 1711 Broadway that was once a Reo Motor Car
dealership. Reo was founded by Ransom Eli Olds (that is, REO), who
also put his name on the Oldsmobile.
</P>
<P>
   Up ahead, gleaming like a frosted Gothic angel cake, is the
nine-story Argonaut Building, 224 West 57th Street, another
potential landmark. Festooned with decorative details _ lion's-head
brackets, grotesques and stars-and-stripes shields _ the structure
was designed by Francis Hatch Kimball to harmonize with the
Broadway Tabernacle church, which once stood next door at Broadway
and 56th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Kimball designed two harmonious structures in 1909:
the A.T. Demarest &AMP; Co. Building, at the southeast corner of
Broadway and 57th Street, and the Peerless Motor Car Co. Building,
an L-shaped affair that wrapped around the Demarest Building, with
facades on both Broadway and 57th Street.
</P>
<P>
   In the Demarest showroom were Renaults, known as ``the Pride of
France,'' and Italas from Turin. Peerless _ ``All That The Name
Implies'' _ was a celebrated luxury carmaker that reached the end
of its road in 1932, during the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   The fledgling General Motors Corp. bought the Demarest and
Peerless Buildings in 1916 and combined them. A Cadillac dealership
remained on the ground floor for many years, in what is now a Duane
Reade drugstore. A remnant of the GM days is the word ``Corp.'' in
a rooftop sign.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors moved in 1927 to its own building, 1775 Broadway,
at the northwest corner of 57th Street, designed by Shreve &AMP; Lamb,
later the architects of the Empire State Building. This 26-story
tower rose atop the earlier three-story Colonnade Building by
William Welles Bosworth, seemingly supported by its mammoth,
trunklike Ionic columns. They now frame the windows of Coliseum
Books.
</P>
<P>
   With a series of setbacks, this powerfully spare composition
recalled the mesas of the Southwest _ if mesas had been topped by
electric General Motors signs. The building is now home to
Newsweek, and the sign now advertises the A&AMP;E ``Biography'' series.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, the Hearst Corp. acquired the Argonaut Building, where
it had been a tenant for many years. Cosmopolitan, Cosmo Girl,
Country Living, Popular Mechanics and Redbook are among the Hearst
magazines based there today.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst has operated on and around Columbus Circle since 1895,
when William Randolph Hearst bought the Virginia Hotel at 59th
Street and turned it into the office of The New York Journal.
Today, Hearst's Esquire magazine is in the former Automobile Club
annex on 55th Street, and its Classic American Homes and Marie
Claire magazines are in the former United States Rubber Building.
(Its corporate headquarters, at Eighth Avenue and 57th Street, are
only a block from Automobile Row.)
</P>
<P>
   The 20-story tower built in 1912 for United States Rubber, the
forerunner of Uniroyal, is the cynosure of Automobile Row.
</P>
<P>
   Clad in Vermont marble and crowned with a broad copper cornice,
it meets the oblique intersection of Broadway and 58th Street with
a rounded prow, resembling a 275-foot stack of tires, and hovers
over Columbus Circle like an alabaster version of the Flatiron
Building.
</P>
<P>
   Carrere &AMP; Hastings, the architects of the New York Public
Library on Fifth Avenue, designed the building. They specified
rubber-tile floors and marble trim for the ground-floor United
States Tire showroom. Altered beyond recognition in 1959, this
space is now a branch of the HSBC Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The ornate elevator lobby was reclaimed in 1986 after an
associate in the architectural firm of Beyer Blinder Belle
discovered rosettes and a frieze above the modern dropped ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Raab, the chairwoman of the landmarks commission, said the
building was likely to be designated this fall. The owners are not
opposed, said their lawyer, Mark A. Levine of Herrick, Feinstein,
and are even planning to light the tower at night to show off its
architectural features. End of the Road
</P>
<P>
   Next door, at 1780 Broadway, is another potential landmark, the
12-story former B.F. Goodrich Co. Building, completed in 1909 and
designed by Howard Van Doren Shaw. Though not as exuberant as its
neighbor, the facade warrants a second look for its novel
combination of neo-Classical and Vienna Secessionist motifs
surrounding horizontal window bays worthy of the Chicago School of
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Carrere &AMP; Hastings and Shreve, Lamb &AMP; Blake designed the
26-story Fisk Building at 250 West 57th Street, on the southwest
corner of Broadway, which is now undergoing a $10 million, two-year
renovation by its owners, a partnership that includes Peter L.
Malkin. At least through the late 1930s, the building was
ornamented by the Fisk Rubber Co.'s trademark image: a sleepy young
boy in pajamas, candle in one hand and a tire slung over his
shoulder. ``Time to Re-tire?'' the sign asked.
</P>
<P>
   Donald B. Kaplan, who managed the building in the late 1970's,
recalls seeing the sign as a young boy. ``It was something I could
identify with because I wore Dr. Denton's, too,'' he said, ``though
we did not live by candlelight.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisk was acquired by U.S. Rubber in 1939, but Malkin has no
plans to retire the name on the building. ``We just feel that the
name is known and has some marketing value,'' he said.
</P>

WEB'S ACADEMIC PROMISE REMAINS UNFULFILLED _ FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif., Wash., Mich., Md., Neb.)   (Eds: CORRECTS Forbes' age to 18 in 2nd graf of 2nd take.) 
By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEAVERVILLE, Calif. _ When it learned last year that a private
company was offering college-level Advanced Placement courses on
the Web, the lone high school in this remote gold-rush town thought
it had finally discovered a perfect way to mine the genuine
academic potential of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   To the school, Trinity High, with 500 students, the prospect of
hiring its own Advanced Placement teacher had always been an
unaffordable luxury, even though taking such courses has become a
near necessity for students to get into the most competitive
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   So the school &UR; , &LR;  in the redwood-dense mountains halfway between
San Francisco and the Oregon border, logged on. In essence, it took
the Clinton administration up on its pledge that educational
salvation could be found in new technology, and that the Web could
help the nation's poorest schools approximate the offerings of the
wealthiest, particularly in a corner of the curriculum where the
discrepancies were most stark.
</P>
<P>
   But so far the results here and elsewhere have been ragged,
suggesting that a computer can be a crude substitute for a teacher,
particularly when the students are so young, the stakes for them
are so high and the technology is so new.
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand high school students nationwide took
college-level courses online this year, through a private company
called Apex Learning, or one of three state university systems.
They included two teen-agers here, each of whom enrolled in an
advanced government and politics class in which the lessons were
transmitted through electronic text and animated short films, with
exams graded via email. The teacher was never seen.
</P>
<P>
   One Weaverville student dropped out midway through the spring
semester because, he said, he could not summon the stamina to
continue, absent a teacher standing in front of him; the other
student finished the same course, but two weeks late, frustrated by
countless technical glitches that often prevented him from logging
onto the Web for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Similar growing pains were felt by other districts, including
some of those that also contracted with Apex, of Bellevue, Wash., a
leader in providing Advanced Placement courses online. Of the 600
students in 28 states who enrolled in at least one of the company's
online Advanced Placement courses, two-thirds did not complete
enough of the course work to take the final exam.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is still pretty new and we are all learning about it,''
said Sally Narodick, the chief executive of Apex, which was
incorporated two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Much is riding on whether such efforts succeed.
</P>
<P>
   While President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore have heralded
the educational possibilities of the Web, most of what has been
labeled instruction in cyberspace is supplemental at best _ SAT
training, college counseling and virtual field trips.
</P>
<P>
   But online Advanced Placement courses represent something else,
one of the nation's first real opportunities to marshal technology
to plug gaping holes in the core curriculums of financially pressed
rural and inner-city high schools that cannot afford luxuries like
college level courses. Apex charges schools $325 to $400 per
student. Hiring a teacher could cost more than $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Apex, one of the few for-profit ventures in the online Advanced
Placement business, has raised $40 million from investors,
including Warburg Pincus, a Wall Street firm; Vulcan Ventures, a
fund led by Paul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft; and Edison
Schools, the public-school management company led by the
entrepreneur Christopher C. Whittle. Michigan State University, the
University of Nebraska and Johns Hopkins University are also
offering college-level courses to high school students online.
</P>
<P>
   All are seeking to close one of the widest gaps between rich and
poor schools. First begun as an experiment in the 1950s involving
fewer than 2,000 students and a handful of college level courses,
the Advanced Placement program, run by the College Board, now
involves more than 700,000 high school students who took 1.1
million final course exams for college credit this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Though enrollment in at least one such course is regarded as an
unofficial prerequisite for admission to the nation's most
selective colleges _ and the University of California system gives
applicants who take such courses extra credit on their transcripts
_ only half of the nation's high school students have access to
Advanced Placement courses, which are regarded as a perk in
districts strapped for cash.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Education Richard Riley has proposed that every
high school in the country offer at least one Advanced Placement
course by 2002, and add at least one new course each year over the
next 10 years. The Clinton administration has asked Congress to
spend $10 million to help rural and inner-city schools purchase
Advanced Placement courses online.
</P>
<P>
   To Gaston Caperton, the president of the College Board, such
online courses are a weak stand-in for what he says the country
needs: 180,000 teachers trained to offer college-level courses to 2
million more high school students.
</P>
<P>
   But Francisco J. Hernandez, vice chancellor of the University of
California at Santa Cruz, says such plans are pipe dreams,
considering that many of the districts lacking Advanced Placement
courses are in the grip of a severe teacher shortage in even basic
subjects. Often, Hernandez said, an online course, however flawed,
is the only opportunity a student has to take one. This past school
year, the University of California College Prep Initiative,
conceived by Hernandez and operated out of the system's Santa Cruz
campus, used state grants to pay for 800 California high school
students to take Advanced Placement courses online. They included
the two at Weaverville.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intent is not to be an alternative to a high quality
teacher and classroom,'' Hernandez said. ``Our intent is to be an
alternative to nothing, and that's what they're getting right
now.''

</P>
<P>
   In Weaverville, a town of 3,370 residents, many of them loggers
and forest rangers, the experience of the two students who took
Apex's online government course underscored the program's promise
and its flaws.
</P>
<P>
   For Brian Jones, 19, a senior who wants to be a record producer,
and Jeremy Forbes, 18, who dreams of becoming a cartoonist, taking
college-level ``U.S. Government and Politics'' introduced them to
the concepts of pluralism, federalism, liberalism and conservatism.
Both said they now looked at presidential politics in a new light.
</P>
<P>
   But each was tripped up by shortcomings that, so far, are
embedded in such courses.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-March, in the seventh week of the 15-week course, Jones
was still doing work he should have completed in the second week.
Overwhelmed by the idea of writing a two-page essay twice a week,
and an exam every three weeks, Jones was already thinking of
summer. And with his professor, Steve Sandweiss, 448 miles away in
Tacoma, Wash., where he is a professor at a community college,
Jones dropped out, enrolling instead in his high school's civics
course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel like doing any work,'' he said. ``I'm just not
organized a lot of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes was far more dogged, but he had ongoing problems signing
onto the Apex Web site _ sometimes because of problems on Apex's
end, and sometimes because of the limited capacity of the computers
in his school.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes finished the course two weeks late, and took the Advanced
Placement exam. He will know his grade soon but said that for all
the disruption he felt well-prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Apex officials said that they were already working to rectify
problems, smoothing software miscommunication, extending the course
calendar by three weeks and providing training for mentor teachers
in students' high schools. But Forbes' guidance counselor, Noreen
Bradbury, said that even in their present form, the online courses
were a godsend.
</P>
<P>
   She said she already had 11 students signed up to take advanced
courses next year in history, statistics, psychology, government
and economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It opens the world to our kids,'' she said. ``They're not
distant and different from everyone else out there. They're as
good.''

ROSLER-ART -- Martha Rosler, the multimedia artist, critic,
theorist, teacher and art-world provocateur. In a career spanning
35 years, Rosler, whose disdain for the normal rites of passage
from galleries to collectors to museums struck many as criminal,
has clung tenaciously to a very personal art that refuses to
separate aesthetics from politics. Rosler is reflected in her
photograph ``Untitled (Nassau Street),'' hanging at the Gorney
Bravin and Lee Gallery in Chelsea in June. (Ruth Fremson/The New

broken, apparently upon impact with a tanker. Andrew Konnerth, a

speaks of a solution to Kosovo's many problems: a year after the
end of the war here, chaos and dislocation continue, manifested in
the doubling or even tripling of the population of this ramshackle
town, now home to more than half a million people. Mostly people

<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. -- There's a lot at stake in Sunday's
Hollywood Gold Cup. Prestige, a purse of $1 million, and points
that count toward NTRA series bonuses as high as $1.28 million.
</P>
<P>
   To look at the field, though, you'd think there must also be a
door prize for the horse who traveled the farthest to be here.
</P>
<P>
   That prize would go to Blueprint, the Irish-bred who arrived at
Hollywood Park last week after racing 18 times in England and
France. But others in the nine-horse field have come a long way,
too - notably David and Pleasant Breeze, New York-based horses who
come out of third- and seventh-place finishes in the Massachusetts
Handicap at Suffolk Downs.
</P>
<P>
   Horses have come from all over to challenge 9-5 favorite General
Challenge in the 61st running of the 1-mile race.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's as it should be for a race of this stature,'' National
Thoroughbred Racing Association spokesman Eric Wing said after
entries were taken Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   That's as it should be, all right - but rarely is in major
California races. The Santa Anita Handicap hasn't had a horse ship
in from the East to win since New York's Royal Glint in 1976
(unless you count Maryland's Broad Brush, who ran in the Strub
Stakes, went home to train, then returned for the Big `Cap). The
Pacific Classic at Del Mar hasn't had a winner from out of state in
its nine-year history.
</P>
<P>
   But the Gold Cup is proving to be the exception. The past decade
saw Sultry Song (1992), Cigar (1995) and Skip Away (1998) ship and
win. And for 2000 you need a map as well as a copy of the Daily
Racing Form to handicap the race.
</P>
<P>
   Even supposedly Southern California-based horses seem to be just
dropping by for the Gold Cup - D. Wayne Lukas-trained Cat Thief
after running his past three races in Arkansas, Maryland and
Kentucky, and Bobby Frankel-trained Chester House after running his
past four in Florida, Louisiana, New York and Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they just do a good job at Hollywood to sell the race
and entice us,'' said Jim Bond, the New York-based trainer of
Pleasant Breeze, a 5-year-old gelding who was second to Golden
Missile in the Pimlico Special two starts back.
</P>
<P>
   But it's more than aggressive salesmanship by the racing office.
</P>
<P>
   The million-dollar purse helps. Then again, the Big 'Cap and the
Pacific Classic are million-dollar races, too.
</P>
<P>
   The California weather helps. By contrast, when the Big 'Cap is
run in March, it can be wet in Arcadia, no inducement for Eastern
horses encamped in sunny Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Park's running surface helps. Del Mar's has come to be
known as unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think timing is everything. The Santa Anita Handicap is
toward the beginning of the year,'' Bond said, indicating that many
top horses aren't cranked up for intersectional showdowns in the
winter. ``This (summer) time of year is what you'd call a quiet
time.''
</P>
<P>
   There used to be a theory that it was harder for horses to ship
east to west than west to east. It was actually an old wives' tale
spread by Eastern trainers to explain their failures out here - and
Western horses' successes on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no logic to it,'' said Michael Hushion, trainer of
David, a 4-year-old colt making his second trip to California,
having lost a photo finish to Early Pioneer in the San Bernardino
at Santa Anita. ``Possibly (the explanation was that) California
talent was underrated.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrivals of David and Pleasant Breeze swelled the Gold Cup
field to the largest since nine horses chased Best Pal home in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   David, a son of Mt. Livermore owned by Calvin Klein Inc. CEO
Barry K. Schwartz and ridden by Aaron Gryder, is 12-1 on the
morning line. He'd be the first New York-bred to win the Gold Cup,
and the first California stakes winner for Hushion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it's one of the premier races in the country,''
Hushion said. ``If you want to prove to everyone that he's a top
horse, and if you want him to have a future at stud, you've got to
run in these races. This horse doesn't seem to have any problem
shipping.''
</P>
<P>
   David will have run at a different track in seven consecutive
races.
</P>
<P>
   Pleasant Breeze, listed at 20-1, can top that: The 5-year-old
gelding, a Kentucky-bred son of Pleasant Tap, is about to run at
his ninth different track in a row, covering eight states.
</P>
<P>
   He'll have 1999 Eclipse Award winner Jorge Chavez aboard again.
The jockey missed the Mass Cap with an injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm testing the waters out in California to see how strong
that (handicap) division is,'' said Bond, who has Behrens on the
East Coast. ``He (Pleasant Breeze) is a really good travel horse.
He's a horse you can put in a suitcase.''
</P>
<P>
   How do the Californians feel about the invasion?
</P>
<P>
   ``As a fan, it's nice to see everybody come in,'' said Richard
Mandella, who trains Gold Cup entrants Out of Mind (5-2) and Big
Ten (12-1). ``As a trainer, I'd like to see them and General
Challenge stay home.''
</P>
<P>
   The weekend: The undercard will give the connections of some
Gold Cup horses a chance to make a big day bigger or earn
consolation, as the case may be.
</P>
<P>
   Mandella also has two horses, Lexicon and Expressionist, in the
$300,000 Triple Bend Handicap, Hollywood Park's biggest sprint
race. Mandella can equal Charlie Whittingham with a fourth Triple
Bend victory.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel and owner Juddmonte Farms, who have Chester House in the
Gold Cup, also entered Honest Lady in the $200,000 A Gleam Handicap
for fillies and mares. Chester House and Honest Lady have something
else in common: Both call Toussaud ``Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Record carryover: Upset wins Thursday by claimer A Lil Sweet
($14.60), first-time starter Tracy ($27.20) and front-running Lord
Sterling ($30.20) made the pick-six too difficult for the Hollywood
Park bettors for the second afternoon in a row, setting up a
carryover of $713,923 for tonight.
</P>
<P>
   It's the largest two-day carryover in Hollywood Park history. It
surpasses the record of $638,000 on May 16, 1999. That one led to a
total pool of more than $3 million, from which eight perfect
tickets paid $246,000.
</P>
<P>
   The pick-six on tonight's 7 o'clock card begins with the third
race. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
A WEEK AT THE RACES
</P>
<P>
   Lemon Drop Kid moved from No.6 to 2 and Behrens dropped from
No.2 to 3 in the NTRA media poll after the former beat the latter
in the Suburban Handicap Tuesday at Belmont Park. Golden Missile
remained No. 1. ... Preakness Stakes winner Red Bullet and Belmont
Stakes winner Commendable square off Sunday in the Dwyer at
Belmont. ... Kentucky Derby winner Fusaichi Pegasus returned Monday

appear are jockey Johnny Longden (four winners, starting with Noor,
1950) and trainer Ross Brinson (Cover Up, 1947). Longden, 93, and
Brinson, 88, are the oldest living Gold Cup champions. ... Many of
the top Hollywood Park jockeys, as well as Kentucky-based Hall of
Famer Pat Day, are scheduled to sign autographs from 11 to 11:30
a.m. Sunday near the saddling paddock. Donations to the Jockeys'
Guild's disabled riders fund will be accepted. ... Hollywood Park

speaks of a solution to Kosovo's many problems: a year after the
end of the war here, chaos and dislocation continue, manifested in
the doubling or even tripling of the population of this ramshackle
town, now home to more than half a million people. Mostly people

The 55-ton whale, which scientists believe was between four and six
years old when it was killed, had it's ribs, vertebrae and shoulder
broken, apparently upon impact with a tanker. Andrew Konnerth, a

GORE DEMANDS ANSWERS ON MEDICARE FROM BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: ADDS 9th graf, Thursday's debate ..., of political context
for Gore's remarks.) 
By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Asking repeatedly ``whose side are you on,'' Vice
President Al Gore on Thursday drew a sharp contrast between his
Medicare proposals and those of Gov. George W. Bush, branding his
likely Republican opponent the candidate of powerful industries.
</P>
<P>
   Gore lectured with charts and graphs at a suburban senior
citizens' center, seeking to put the debate over Medicare, the
popular Great Society health insurance program for the elderly, at
the forefront of the campaign agenda.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would devote $339 billion to shoring up the program
during the next decade and adding a new prescription drug benefit
for all Medicare beneficiaries. Bush, he said, had allotted ``not
one dime in his proposal for extending, strengthening, adding to
Medicare. Not a penny.''
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, Gore threw pointed and detailed questions at
Bush, who rarely talks about Medicare. The governor has put forward
broad principles _ but little detail _ for creating more
competition between private and public health plans to overhaul
Medicare for the retirement of the Baby Boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to Medicare questions for which Bush has not provided
specific answers, Gore asked whether Bush supported raising the
eligibility age, or raising premiums, or sending more recipients to
health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Medicare is important to you, these questions are something
you should know the answer to,'' Gore told the audience of the
local elderly residents.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also used a version of an old union organizing slogan about
choosing sides as he tried to frame the election. ``In this
election for president,'' Gore said, ``the fundamental choice has
to do with whose side are you on. I want to fight for the people,
the other side fights for the powerful.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's why the big pharmaceutical companies are supporting
Governor Bush,'' Gore said. ``That's why the big oil companies are
supporting Governor Bush. That's why the big polluters are
supporting Governor Bush. That's why the HMO's and insurance
companies are supporting Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's debate about Medicare was a sign of a new stage in
the Gore campaign. This spring he repeatedly denounced Bush's
policy propos- als as ``risky.'' Then he stepped back and detailed
some new policy propos- als of his own. Now he is trying to start
drawing the contrasts between his own ideas and those of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare is traditionally an issue that plays to the advantage
of Democrats. So far this year it has not had the prominence in the
presidential race that Social Security has had, even though experts
say it faces the possibility of insolvency earlier than the
retirement program does.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign for its part accused Gore of practicing the
politics of class warfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush's campaign is focused on bringing people
together, while Al Gore is trying to pit one group of Americans
against another,'' a spokesman for Bush, Ari Fleischer, said
Thursday. ``We always knew the latest version of Al Gore the
positive wouldn't last long.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign also called Gore and President Clinton
obstacles to keeping Medicare solvent because last year all four of
Clinton's appointees to a bipartisan, 17-member group opposed its
chairman's ideas for overhauling the health care program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore's charts and graphs can't hide the fact that the
Clinton-Gore administration opposed bipartisan Medicare reform and
they submitted a budget to cut Medicare spending by $70 billion,''
said another Bush spokesman, Dan Bartlett, pointing to some savings
Clinton had proposed for the program in his 2001 budget. Bush would
not support those reductions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But along with those savings, Clinton has also called for adding
an expensive new prescription drug program. Gore's slightly
different version of the proposal would cost $255 billion over a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the bipartisan commission, headed by Sen. John B.
Breaux, D-La., fell one vote short of the 11 needed to approve a
final report intended to forge a consensus on how to overhaul the
program. Ten commission members, eight Republicans and two
Democrats, voted for major changes that would convert Medicare into
an arena for competition among public and private health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has criticized the Clinton administration for opposing the
Breaux plan. And Bush's broad concepts generally mirror those of
the majority on the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux had proposed that the government, instead of paying
separately for each medical service, offer a fixed amount of money
to each beneficiary. The beneficiary could use the money to buy
private health insurance, through a managed care plan, or to enroll
in the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   He also proposed offering Medicare coverage of prescription
drugs as a new benefit, with the government paying for drugs for
people with incomes up to 35 percent above the poverty level.
Health maintenance organizations and other private health plans
would have had to offer drug coverage to Medicare beneficiaries,
but they could charge extra.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux's proposals would have also gradually raised the
eligibility age to 67, from 65, charged higher premiums to
high-income people and required beneficiaries to pay 10 percent of
the cost of home health care visits (there is no such co-payment
now).
</P>
<P>
   Gore has taken a different approach, shying away from the
efforts to turn more of the program over to private insurers. He
would use $40 billion of the expected budget surplus and $75
billion of savings in interest payments from paying down the
national debt to extend the life of Medicare until 2030. He would
also enact nearly $30 billion in savings.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told his audience Thursday that he had opposed the Medicare
commission's report because he felt it would raise the eligibility
age, lead to higher premiums and push more people into HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett, Bush's spokesman, said the governor supported the
concepts of the Breaux commission. But he said Bush had not said
where he stood on the eligibility age, and did not believe that the
Breaux plan would lead to premium increases.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has not set out his own Medicare plan but instead named six
principles for change. He has said there should be no rise in
payroll taxes. And he wants Medicare to offer every recipient a
``choice of plans including the option of purchasing a plan that
covers prescription drugs.'' He has said Medicare must cover
expenses for low-income elderly.
</P>
<P>
   His aides say he has earmarked $5 trillion over five years for
shoring up Social Security and Medicare, including a provision for
some kind of prescription drug benefit.

BRADLEY WILL OFFER SUPPORT TO GORE SOON, OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Adds second byline; minor changes.) 
By JAMES DAO and ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ending months of silence, former Sen. Bill Bradley will appear
alongside Vice President Al Gore next week to voice what Democratic
officials described Thursday night as his ``enthusiastic support''
for the man who trounced him in the bitterly contested Democratic
presidential primaries last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Though details of the joint event were still being thrashed out,
the officials said the two men were expected to meet at a rally
next Thursday in Green Bay, Wis. Wisconsin is considered an
important swing state. The officials said the appearance might be
just the first of several joint events before the November
election.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance comes just as Gore is working hard to unify the
party in time for the Democratic National Convention next month,
the event many Democrats are counting on to give his campaign a
lift going into the home stretch this fall.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Gore has been trying to energize the Democratic
base in his public appearances by attacking the oil and
pharmaceutical industries.
</P>
<P>
   Smoothing things over with Bradley would be an important step in
energizing the party, many Democrats say. A cloud of bitterness has
hung over the relationship between Gore and Bradley since Bradley
quit the race in March without having carried a single state. Some
Democrats contend that friction has hurt Gore's ability to present
a united front for the party.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was furious with what he considered Gore's dishonest
attacks on his campaign agenda, particularly his proposal for
universal health care. At the news conference where he announced
his withdrawal from the race, Bradley said he would support the
vice president, but refused to use the word ``endorse.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he would not release the roughly 400 delegates he
had won until the party's convention, raising the possibility that
he might start some policy fights with the vice president's camp.
And he chided Gore for a hard-edged campaign style, a criticism the
Republicans have repeatedly echoed in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that he'll run a better campaign in the general
election,'' Bradley said of Gore at the time.
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic official familiar with the current negotiations
said that Bradley will ``make it very clear that the vice president
has his enthusiastic support.'' The official said it was even
possible that Bradley would use the word ``endorse,'' though
Bradley is well-known for changing his mind on such tactical
matters at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's unequivocal support could help take the edge off
Republican assertions that Gore is a dirty fighter and dishonest
politician who will do or say whatever it takes to win. And because
Bradley received support from Republicans and independents, he
could help Gore woo swing voters who are likely to determine the
outcome in closely contested states.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Discussions about when Bradley would campaign with Gore had been
going on for several months, primarily between Tony Coelho, the
former head of the Gore campaign, and John Roos, a fund-raiser and
confidante to Bradley. William Daley, who replaced Coelho and had a
good relationship with Bradley, picked up the negotiations when
Coelho quit last month.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides have also agreed on Bradley's role at the
convention, one official familiar with the negotiations said. The
official said Bradley will address the convention at a prominent,
possibly prime-time slot. The official would not say which day
Bradley would speak.
</P>
<P>
   With Gore starting to draw stark contrasts between himself and
his Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush, this seemed like the
right time for the two former rivals to appear together, an aide to
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're beginning to ramp into the convention,'' he said. ``It's
a good time for all Democrats to come together and focus on the
task at hand. The differences between Gore and Bradley are
minuscule compared to the miles of differences between them and
George W. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   The aide continued, ``Both Gore and Bradley were in favor of
improving our health care system and George W. Bush has not offered
anything of substance.''

REVISED YUGOSLAV CONSTITUTION ALLOWS MILOSEVIC TO SEEK ANOTHER
TERM 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The Yugoslav Parliament approved
constitutional changes Thursday that allow the Yugoslav president,
Slobodan Milosevic, to run for a new term and that diminish the
influence of Montenegro, Serbia's small sister republic.
</P>
<P>
   The changes, which the Parliament portrayed as strengthening
democracy, require the direct popular election of the Yugoslav
president and of the upper house of Parliament. They allow two
four-year terms for the president and raise the threshold for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The effect will be to give Milosevic a very good chance of
remaining in power past July of next year, when his current term
expires. Until Thursday, the federal president was elected by the
federal Parliament and could serve only one four-year term. And the
upper house of the federal Parliament was itself elected by the
Parliaments of the two republics, Serbia and Montenegro .
</P>
<P>
   The changes put the federal government, instead of the two
republics, in charge of organizing elections.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro, under President Milo Djukanovic, has broken with
Milosevic and moved toward the West, and has vowed to hold a
referendum on independence. Thursday's changes make Milosevic's
plans for elections less dependent on Montenegro's consent and may
hasten Montenegro's risky effort to break away.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegrin leaders expressed outrage at Thursday's votes. One
told The Associated Press, ``Yugoslavia was erased today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Since this amounts to the constitution of a new country,
Montenegro is now forced into making inevitable moves,'' said
Miodrag Vukovic, a senior adviser to Djukanovic. ``In the next few
days, Montenegro will adopt laws which will wrap up its
independence in all fields.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic must call federal and municipal elections by the end
of this year, and he is likely to hold presidential elections at
the same time, while the opposition is bickering and the
independent media are under increasing pressure from the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Djukanovic decides that Montenegro should boycott the
federal elections, they will take place anyway, and Milosevic's
allies there, who attract at least 30 percent of the vote, will win
seats.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia's divided democratic opposition, most of which already
boycotts the Parliament and thus did not vote against the changes,
seemed caught by surprise, without a clear candidate to run against
Milosevic.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The lower chamber passed the changes 95-7, while the vote in the
upper chamber was 27-0.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's debate, the Radical Party leader, Vojislav Seselj,
argued that direct elections were the rule in most modern
democratic states.
</P>
<P>
   But Vladeta Jankovic of the opposition Democratic Party of
Serbia told the lower house: ``The constitution is being changed
for the sake of just one man.'' He denounced the haste of the
voting, and said: ``It is shameful that we are agreeing to adapt
the constitution to one man, Slobodan Milosevic, who should rule
forever and move from one presidential armchair into another until
infinity.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has already been elected to two terms as Serbian
president, and when he could not run again under the constitution,
he became federal president, taking on sweeping powers not foreseen
for this putatively figurehead office.
</P>
<P>
   Now, reaching the constitutional limit for this job, Milosevic
has changed the constitution to allow two terms.
</P>
<P>
   But he has also challenged the democratic opposition to beat him
in a direct vote.
</P>
<P>
   While deeply unpopular in opinion polls, Milosevic is
nonetheless regarded by Serbs as better at his job than any of the
democratic leaders, who are considered ambitious and divided.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll done in early May for the National Democratic
Institute, some 38 percent of Serbs said that Milosevic ``may not
be perfect, but he's better than the opposition,'' and he remained
the most popular choice as leader of Serbia _ the only one whose
ratings were larger than the ``don't knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, only 14 to 18 percent of the people, in various polls,
think he is the best leader for Serbia. But his ratings are three
times higher than those for Vuk Draskovic, the leader of the
Serbian Renewal Movement, who gets about 6 percent, while the
Democratic Party leader, Zoran Djindjic, gets about 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dragoslav Avramovic, the former head of the Central Bank who
beat back Yugoslavia's inflation, gets about 8 percent, but he is
old and ill. Still, if the opposition could unite behind a single
candidate in a two-way race, a Milosevic victory would not be
guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   For Montenegro, which has about 600,000 people compared to
Serbia's 10 million, the changes undercut some of the artificial
protectins it received as Serbia's formal equal in the federal
structure. Given its tiny size, it is unlikely that a Montenegrin
could ever win election as federal president.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegrin officials also complained that they were not
consulted on these changes.
</P>
<P>
   The republic's government and Parliament will meet on Friday,
when they are likely to refuse to recognize the legitimacy of what
happened Thursday.

ITALY CONSIDERS PLANS TO FREE INMATES FROM BURSTING PRISONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ With 53,000 people in a prison system built for fewer
than 43,000, Italy now has its largest prison population since the
end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since members of the governing center-left coalition last
month began gingerly discussing easing conditions by freeing
thousands of prisoners under a general pardon or amnesty, prisons
across Italy have erupted in disturbances and protests, with
prisoners _ and sometimes the guards _ conducting strikes, burning
mattresses and going on hunger strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from inmates, guards and Pope John Paul II, the
Senate Judiciary Committee voted on Wednesday to examine five draft
proposals to free prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The pope, who intends to visit a Roman prison on Sunday on a
Holy Year day dedicated to prisoners, last week asked governments
worldwide for leniency toward inmates, saying, ``A reduction, even
a modest one, of the term of punishment would be for prisoners a
clear sign of sensitivity to their condition.'' The Vatican has
helped raise the expectations of Italian inmates and put pressure
on politicians, who are uncomfortable with a step that a majority
of Italians oppose.
</P>
<P>
   The center-right opposition, led by Silvio Berlusconi, the media
baron, has rejected suggestions that Parliament approve a general
pardon to ease prison conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition argues that the entire justice system needs a
rehauling and that dangerous criminals could be freed. Italians
generally have little faith in the judicial system, but they are
also increasingly concerned about crime. Polls suggest that most
Italians oppose an amnesty or pardon.
</P>
<P>
   The lower house of Parliament has 20 proposals, and the Senate
has five.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Prime Minister Giuliano Amato has not issued
its own bill. Instead, politicians have floated proposals.
</P>
<P>
   With national elections expected to be held in a year, the
battle has many layers beneath the pros and cons raised in public
debate. Berlusconi had a private meeting with Justice Minister
Piero Fassino last week on the issue. Afterward, Berlusconi
rejected the notion of a general pardon.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, a general pardon would release prisoners who have less
than three years remaining on their sentences.
</P>
<P>
   But Berlusconi did not rule out an amnesty, which would release
prisoners under certain conditions, expunge their records and also
wipe out certain trials in progress. Some legal experts argue that
an amnesty would help unclog the backlog of court cases and be more
effective than a general pardon.
</P>
<P>
   But Berlusconi, who has had several convictions of accounting
fraud and bribery and who has been acquitted on appeal of several
convictions of accounting fraud and bribery, faces trials on other
charges of false accounting and could benefit personally _ and
politically _ from an amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   That has led center-left politicians to make sarcastic remarks
about Berlusconi's personal motives, as well as pious remarks about
the center-right opposition's failure to heed the pope's pleas.
</P>
<P>
   But Amato's center-left coalition is deeply divided and in
disarray. Many political experts and even members of his coalition
suspect that the Amato government could end up reaching an
agreement with the opposition to grant an amnesty, hoping to avert
a confidence vote that could force early elections, which the
center-left fears it would lose in its present frazzled state.

CLINTON PREPARING TO DELAY U.S. EXECUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, N.C., Puerto Rico, Va., N.Y., Md.)   (ADDS location of case in 14th graf) 
By RAYMOND BONNER and MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration is planning to postpone
the first federal execution in nearly 40 years because of a lack of
clemency procedures and concerns about racial and geographic
disparities in death penalty cases, administration officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is awaiting Justice Department regulations for
death row inmates to follow in seeking clemency from the president.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Raul Garza, who was convicted seven years ago of three
drug-related murders, is scheduled to be executed on Aug. 5, and
his lawyers said Thursday that they would use the new procedures as
soon as they have them to ask President Clinton to spare Garza's
life.
</P>
<P>
   The department is also finishing a report on whether members of
racial minorities or defendants in certain parts of the country are
more likely to face the federal death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Data gathered so far by the Justice Department shows that
members of minorities make up more than three-quarters of the
defendants in federal capital cases and that federal prosecutors in
five districts, including two in New York, have filed nearly half
of the federal cases in which the death penalty was an option,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department report, to be released later this month,
is certain to generate questions about the fairness of the federal
death penalty beyond the Garza case, which would be the first
federal execution since John F. Kennedy was president, officials
said. There are currently 21 men who face the death penalty for
federal crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The new clemency procedures, the first in federal capital cases
since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988, should be
completed within a week or two, a Justice Department spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   They will allow for the death row inmate's lawyer to make an
oral presentation to a clemency panel, and the process, from filing
to final decision, will take at least 90 days, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A White House official said Garza, who was convicted in 1993 in
Brownsville, Texas, would be allowed to take advantage of the new
procedures. Thus, his execution will have to be postponed,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department spokesman said the department had no
authority to grant a reprieve to Garza at this time, and that the
sole power for such a reprieve now lay with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Constitution, the president's pardon powers are
absolute. Thus, options in the Garza case include a pardon, which
would erase the criminal record, commutation to a life sentence or
a temporary reprieve, which would allow Garza to follow the new
clemency procedures. A 90-day reprieve would put off the execution
until after the election, one official noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're cautiously optimistic,'' said Garza's lawyer, Gregory W.
Wiercioch of the Texas Defender Service in Houston. Wiercioch added
that he had not been given official notice of any reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until then, we have to move forward on other fronts,'' he
said. Wiercioch was in Washington Thursday looking for support for
his client.
</P>
<P>
   Garza has had his hopes dashed before. When Judge Filemon B.
Vela of U.S. District Court in Brownsville first proposed setting
an August execution date, U.S. Attorney Mervyn M. Mossbacker Jr.
joined the defense in asking that he not do so. Noting that it
would be the first federal execution in more than three decades,
Mossbacker said the Justice Department was developing guidelines
and procedures to ensure that it would be carried out ``in an
appropriate, dignified and expeditious manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Although declaring that he was ``not a proponent of the death
penalty,'' Vela rejected the arguments and set the date, after
which the U.S. attorney dropped further opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Garza, a high school dropout who is the son of migrant farm
workers, was the head of a drug-running operation that smuggled in
tons of marijuana from Mexico, according to the federal charges. He
was convicted of ordering the execution of three people as part of
his criminal enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Although Garza has declared that he was not responsible for the
murders, his lawyers, in seeking clemency, do not intend to argue
that he is innocent. Rather, they will argue that it is unfair to
put Garza to death because the federal death penalty system, as it
currently operates, discriminates against members of minorities and
is unevenly applied across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The administration of the federal death penalty is like a
``rigged lottery,'' with the outcome determined by ``the color of
your skin and where you purchased your ticket,'' Wiercioch said.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference last week, Clinton said he was concerned
about ``the disturbing racial composition'' of the federal death
penalty population, and that a handful of federal districts account
for the majority of death penalty cases, ``which raises the
question of whether, even though there is a uniform law across the
country, what your prosecution is may turn solely on where you
committed the crime.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Clinton said, he had asked the Justice Department
to undertake a review.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court declared in 1972 that the death penalty as it
was then applied was unconstitutional. In 1988, Congress enacted
legislation that allowed prosecutors to seek the death penalty for
certain crimes. It was first applied to drug-related crimes, in
what has become known as the ``drug kingpin statute.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of his political career, Clinton has been a
stalwart backer of the death penalty. In his 1992 campaign,
Clinton, then governor of Arkansas, interrupted his campaign to
deny clemency to two inmates who subsequently were executed by
lethal injection. As president, he signed legislation in 1994 that
expanded the federal death penalty to about 60 crimes. Two years
later, after the Oklahoma City bombing, he backed a law
streamlining the appeals process, which applied to both state and
federal prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one men have a death sentence hanging over them, said the
Federal Death Penalty Resource Project, an organization in
Columbia, S.C., that opposes the death penalty. Fourteen are
African-American, three are Hispanic, one is Asian and three are
white, including Timothy McVeigh, who was convicted in the Oklahoma
City bombings.
</P>
<P>
   With most of these men having only recently exhausted all their
appeals, the Justice Department has not been under pressure to
adopt federal rules for clemency, which is an inmate's last hope
after all the courts have spoken. Even without formal procedures,
however, federal inmates are able to petition the president for
redress.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. attorney needs the approval of the attorney general
before seeking the death penalty, and Attorney General Janet Reno
has instituted a formal procedure for federal prosecutors to follow
in seeking that approval.
</P>
<P>
   In a case in which the death penalty is an option, the
prosecutor is required to send a memorandum to the Justice
Department, with a recommendation on whether or not it should be
sought. A committee set up by Reno then reviews the file and makes
a recommendation to her.
</P>
<P>
   A defendant's lawyer is allowed to make a presentation to the
federal prosecutor before the government seeks the death penalty,
and then to the Justice Department review committee, two levels of
protection that do not exist for a defendant in state capital
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Going back to 1988, the attorney general has authorized the
death penalty against 199 defendants, according to the death
penalty project. Three-fourths of these defendants have been
members of minority groups, with 103 of them African-Americans, the
project said.
</P>
<P>
   A former member of the death penalty review committee, Rory K.
Little, has described Reno's death-penalty case review system as
``consciously race-blind.''
</P>
<P>
   The racial disparities creep into the system, said Little, who
now teaches at Hastings College of Law in San Francisco, because of
the wide discretion given to federal prosecutors. They decided in
the first instance whether to charge a defendant with a crime that
carries the death penalty and then whether to plea bargain for a
life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   This same discretion explains the geographic disparities in the
system, he said. A chart published by Little in a law review
article showed that for the years 1995 through 1998, U.S. attorneys
submitted 471 death penalty cases to the Justice Department for
review. Slightly more than 200 were from five judicial districts.
Puerto Rico was at the top, with 59 submissions; the Eastern
District of Virginia followed, with 52; the Eastern District of New
York, 42; the Southern District of New York, 30, and Maryland, 24.
</P>
<P>
   A Clinton administration official said that the numbers would be
updated in the department's current report, but that the five
districts still led in death penalty cases.

DODGERS' BROWN DOMINATES PADRES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ A year ago, Kevin Brown was treated horribly in San
Diego, and by San Diego. He was pummeled at Qualcomm Stadium in one
start, lost another one, and was dissed when it came to an All-Star
selection by Padres manager Bruce Bochy.
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed a bit.
</P>
<P>
   In his final outing before the All-Star break, Brown was simply
overpowering. He tied a career high with 12 strikeouts, and Shawn
Green broke out of a miserable slump as the Los Angeles Dodgers
beat the Padres 9-3 in the series finale Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Brown (8-2) was so dominating he retired 10
straight. He also went a stretch in which nine of 10 outs he
recorded were via strikeout. And his next appearance most likely
will be in Tuesday's All-Star Game in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, I made two really bad pitches and they both
wound up in the seats,'' said Brown, named to the National League
All-Star squad Wednesday. ``It wound up not being an issue because
the guys behind me did such a great job of putting runs on the
board. We came back. We were down 2-0, and it started right away,
and we kept pushing.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, if only Brown could get some help from the other starters,
the Dodgers could possibly put together a serious winning streak.
The last time a starter other than Brown won was Chan Ho Park, who
beat St. Louis on June 18.
</P>
<P>
   Brown allowed four hits and didn't walk a batter, but he did
make two mistakes that resulted in San Diego's runs. After a
five-minute delay in the first inning because of an ill-positioned
banner in center field, Brown allowed a two-run homer to Phil Nevin
after a single by Ryan Klesko. The other hits were a fifth-inning
double by Wiki Gonzalez and a seventh-inning homer by Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like when they got those hits, (Brown) turned it up
to another level and kept guys off balance,'' Dodgers left fielder
Gary Sheffield said. ``The ball, from what I was seeing, was moving
all over the place. He was jamming a lot of guys. Nobody was
getting a good swing off him, and when he's like that, it's just a
matter of time before we can score runs. He's going to shut the
game down.''
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Beltre gave the Dodgers a 3-2 lead with a two-run homer
in the fourth, and right fielder Shawn Green snapped out of his
funk with his first homer since June 23. Green added a double and
could have had a two-run triple in the eighth but for a scoring
decision that went against him.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Todd Hundley continued to work toward a huge offseason
deal with some team as his revitalization continued. Hundley, a
career .236 hitter entering the season, had three hits, including
his 17th homer, and drove in two runs to raise his average to .318.
</P>
<P>
   ``My swing, it just clicked,'' said Green, who was 5 for 41
entering the game. ``I've been trying all different things and
nothing worked. Finally, I was able to stay back. I was jumping at
the ball too much. I finally got the right thought that kicked in,
and it worked. It's been a frustrating few weeks. It's tough when
you get in a rut. You go through a list of things to try, and when
something finally works it's a big load off your mind.''

THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE FROM MAHARISHI U.
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.H., Iowa, Pa., Mass.)  By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ His own press secretary concedes that he has an
unusual curriculum vitae for a presidential candidate. John Hagelin
is a quantum physicist who preaches the benefits of transcendental
meditation. He runs the physics department at an Iowa university
named for Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. As the presidential candidate of
the Natural Law Party in 1996, he won exactly 0.12 percent of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   But John Hagelin is also the man standing between Pat Buchanan
and $12.6 million in federal matching funds, and that has made him
a suddenly attractive commodity to Reform Party members opposed to
Buchanan's social conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   Only Hagelin and Buchanan are on the ballot in the Reform Party
primary, which began this week with the mailing of about 1 million
ballots to party supporters across the country. The winner will be
announced at the party's convention in August, and the winner's
campaign will receive the millions in matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who has spent months gathering ballot access
signatures from some 500,000 prospective voters, all of whom are
receiving ballots, would seem to have a lock on the nomination. But
his candidacy has roiled an already fractured party that everyone
from Donald Trump to Jesse Ventura has tried to lay claim to this
election season.
</P>
<P>
   And with Ross Perot, the party's founder, now declining to
challenge Buchanan for the nomination, Buchanan opponents have been
desperately casting about for an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin is it. On Thursday, the leaders of the Independence
Party, the Reform Party's New York incarnation, gathered at the
Grand Hyatt Hotel in Manhattan to express their support for him.
Among those attending was the avowed Marxist Lenora Fulani, herself
a former presidential candidate, who last year endorsed Buchanan,
only to break with him last month. On Thursday, Fulani called
Hagelin ``decent, principled, pro-populist,'' and Buchanan
divisive.
</P>
<P>
   Such characterizations aside, the two men could not be more
different. Where Buchanan is ebulliently brash, Hagelin is
soft-spoken and prone to flowery phrases like ``grass-roots
politics and the laws pertaining thereto.'' He emphasizes his
pedigree, peppering his literature with the phrase
``Harvard-trained,'' while Buchanan has fashioned himself
anti-establishmentarian.
</P>
<P>
   And while Buchanan has made opposition to free trade,
immigration and abortion the staples of his campaign, Hagelin
champions preventive medicine, criticizing what he calls a
``disease-care system''; advocates a moratorium on genetically
engineered foods, and has detailed plans for increasing crop yield;
and proposes using ``coherence groups'' of meditators to reduce
stress and crime in major cities.
</P>
<P>
   At the gathering Thursday, he talked of building a ``mainstream
political alternative.'' Buchanan's entrance into the Reform Party,
he said, has caused ``mass attrition,'' and there is a
``grass-roots brush fire waiting to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin, 46, was born in Pittsburgh, graduated from Dartmouth
College and earned master's and doctoral degrees from Harvard. He
lives in rural Fairfield, Iowa, where he works at the Maharishi
University of Management, which calls itself an institution
``utilizing the managing intelligence of Nature for professional

department as well as the Institute of Science, Technology and
Public Policy, which his campaign describes as a ``progressive

   Hagelin challenged Buchanan to three debates. But Brian Doherty,
Buchanan's spokesman, said again that he would not debate his
challenger unless Hagelin promised not to run as the Natural Law
nominee should he lose the Reform nomination. As to the assertion
of Hagelin and others that Buchanan was hurting the Reform Party,
Doherty said it was simply not true. ``The party was in shambles,''
Doherty said, ``and he's rebuilding it.''

   Online Business Exchanges May Raise Antitrust Issues  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As companies in nearly every industry rush to join
business-to-business exchanges on the Internet, regulators are
growing concerned that they will face a rash of new antitrust
questions for which they are not prepared.
</P>
<P>
   The exchanges create a place for companies in the same industry
to buy and sell goods, potentially saving millions of dollars. But
the sites, which can compile huge amounts of sensitive data and are
often jointly owned by corporate rivals, also create opportunities
for collusion and price-fixing that did not exist before, antitrust
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers Post Anemic Sales Rise
</P>
<P>
   Sales in stores open more than a year, a key figure for
measuring the health of the retail industry, rose by only 2.6
percent in June compared with figures in the period a year earlier.
Analysts said the numbers were in line with expectations that the
economy is losing steam. Consumers are spending less at all types
of stores, ranging from specialty apparel stores like the Gap to
discount stores like Kmart.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks Rise in Technology Rebound
</P>
<P>
   Stocks closed mostly higher as Wall Street looked for bargains
in technology shares that were battered in the previous session.
The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index rose 97.47 points, or
2.5 percent, to 3,960.57. The Dow Jones industrial average edged
down 2.13 points, or 0.02 percent, to 10,481.47, cushioned by gains
in Intel and financial stocks. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index finished up 10.44 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,456.67. The
yield on the 10-year note rose to 6.04 percent from 5.98 percent.

   Amtrak to Offer Riders Free Trips
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak said that it would offer every dissatisfied customer a
free repeat trip, even if the problem was not its fault. The new
program is part of Amtrak's campaign to build ridership and revenue
by reducing the number of disgruntled passengers before Congress
cuts off operating subsidies in 2003.

<P>
   SBC to Start Long Distance in Texas
</P>
<P>
   SBC Communications plans to formally announce Friday the
long-distance rates it will charge in Texas, the second state after
New York in which a local phone company will also offer
long-distance service. SBC will charge a basic rate of 9 cents a
minute for in-state and out-of-state calls anytime, with no monthly
fee. It will also cater some services to people who make frequent
calls to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Gtech Warns on Profit; Chief Quits
</P>
<P>
   Gtech Holdings said that its two top executives had resigned and
that its revenue and earnings would fall short of expectations. The
lottery company said the departures of William Y. O'Connor,
chairman and chief executive, and Stephen P. Nowick, president and
chief financial officer, were a result of the board's
dissatisfaction with the unexpected announcement, Gtech's lagging
stock price and the poor handling of a computer flaw in Britain's
national lottery that recently came to light. Shares of Gtech fell
$2.9375, to $19.8125.

   Factory Orders Rose 4.1 Percent in May
</P>
<P>
   Factory orders rose 4.1 percent in May, the largest gain in
almost seven and a half years, suggesting that signs of a slowdown

manufacturers, a report showed. A separate report showed claims for
jobless benefits fell to the lowest level in five weeks.

COLUMN: LOOKING TO THE PAST TO SECURE THE PRESENT 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Columbus had an easier time finding the new world than the
Yankees have had finding a fourth starter in their rotation.
Cracking the Japanese code in World War II was child's play, the
theory of relativity a snap.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the Yankees, who get clubbed and knocked about with
regularity but amazingly remain afloat, like a rubber duck in a
bubble bath, sent the rookie Ed Yarnall to the mound in an attempt
to find another starting pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Yarnall was brought up from Columbus on Thursday, after a good
outing against Toledo, and was immediately named the starter
against the Orioles. Yarnall had been scheduled to be in the
starting rotation in spring training, but poor performances
relegated him to the bushes.
</P>
<P>
   From all accounts, Yarnall is an upstanding left-handed citizen
and, at age 24, may have a long and prosperous career in the major
leagues. Maybe one day we will visit his plaque in Cooperstown. But
he swiftly learned that Baltimore was not Toledo, on the map or at
the plate.
</P>
<P>
   As one fan, seated behind the Orioles' bench, noted with
impressive resonance at one point in the Baltimore half of the
second inning: ``What is this, batting practice?'' And then he
shouted to the Yankee manager: ``C'mon, Joe, get this stiff outta
there!''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, with the Yankees losing, 5-0, and the bases loaded
and still no outs, Joe Torre took the fan's advice. In came Ben
Ford. Out went Yarnall, to a chorus of boos. If you're going to
play Broadway, you'd better have a thick skin. And better stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, Ford had auditioned for a starter's spot
but came up short. The first batter he faced Thursday, Mike
Bordick, doubled. ``Bring back Irabu!'' another fan shouted. Hideki
Irabu, the Japanese import who never lasted as a starting pitcher
with the Yankees, is but a painful memory to Bronx fans.
</P>
<P>
   When the inning was over, the Yankees were behind, 7-0. At this
point, a gloom settled over the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Just three weeks ago, the Yankees had brought up Jake Westbrook
from Columbus and had started him immediately. He got bombed, too,
lasting just two-thirds of an inning longer than Yarnall. He was
soon back in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Now, David Cone has struggled mightily this season and was
bumped from the starting rotation for the coming series against the
Mets. It was hoped he would be the fourth or at least fifth Yankee
starter, but the great competitor and longtime ace has a ballooned
ERA and hasn't won a game since the Coolidge administration. Is it
his arm, his head, or simply senescence? No one knows, not yet,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Yankees search, like coal miners with nail files,
for that helpful hurler, their bats are alive like the sound of
music.
</P>
<P>
   They came back with eight runs in the second inning, and five in
the fourth, took a 13-7 lead and went on to a 13-9 victory. The
bullpen, which has been dependable all year, saved the team again,
along with the likes of Derek Jeter, Paul O'Neill and Bernie
Williams _ each of whom homered, which is nothing new _ and David
Justice, who launched his first homer as a Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, though they are only five games over .500, remained
neck and neck and neck with Toronto and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   It was fortunate for the Yankees that the Baltimore pitchers,
particularly Sidney Ponson and Jason Johnson, seemed under the
impression that they were also were candidates for the Yankees'
rotation, and were pounded.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankee search continues, and they have plucked, of all
people, Dwight Gooden. In recent years, Gooden, 35, has seen many
teams and better days.
</P>
<P>
   The former Met and Yankee and Indian and Astro and Devil Ray is
back in the Yankee organization, and has pitched in relief for the
Yankees' Tampa team in the Gulf Coast League. He was recalled
Thursday to pitch Saturday against the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was recommended from down below,'' said Torre, after the
game, meaning that the Yankee scouts tapped ol' Doc.
</P>
<P>
   Did he feel comfortable with a guy who hasn't pitched in the
majors in two months? ``He's got experience,'' Torre said
tactfully, not appearing wildly enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden has pitched in two games in rookie league ball and given
up no runs in eight innings. But in the majors this year, he was
2-3 with Tampa Bay with a fat 6.63 ERA, and with Houston a no
decision in one appearance with a 9.00 ERA. Off of this, he seems
perfectly suited for the Yankees' rotation. &QL;

ADVERTISING: GILLETTE GOES TO EXTREME WITH ADS FEATURING TOM
GREEN 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICIA WINTERS LAURO  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Green, the outrageous MTV comedian, is best known for stunts
like dropping a live mouse into his mouth, as he does in the hit
gross-out comedy film ``Road Trip,'' or snorkeling for change in a
shopping mall fountain.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly the kind of guy typically embraced by corporate
America, right?
</P>
<P>
   Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette has introduced a television and print campaign using
Green to endorse Right Guard, a brand built over the last dozen
years on the imagery of big, burly jocks like Emmitt Smith, Charles
Barkley and Brett Favre. The Right Guard campaign, carrying the
theme ``Anything less would be uncivilized,'' has helped the brand
maintain its status as the leading deodorant-antiperspirant in
America.
</P>
<P>
   Has Gillette gone mad in choosing Green?
</P>
<P>
   The appearance of anti-establishment entertainment figures in a
variety of advertisements may be evidence of a shift in attitude
from earlier generations. The use of songs by popular bands like
the Red Hot Chili Peppers to advertise automobiles and Green's
serving simultaneously as celebrity pitchman and anarchistic
cable-television comedian suggest that today's fans do not view
such commercial activity as ``selling out.''
</P>
<P>
   The skinny Green _ seemingly the antithesis of an athlete _ was
actually carefully selected by Gillette to pitch a new product
called Right Guard Extreme Sport, developed with the
much-sought-after young male consumer in mind. Even the brand's
name capitalizes on a youthful trend _ the popularity of extreme
sports like bungee jumping, mountain biking and snowboarding. The
sports are definitely not in the mainstream _ which brings Gillette
to Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom stood out as a unique personality and often his character
is extreme,'' said Bernadette King, director of global business
management for antiperspirants and deodorants at Gillette in
Boston. ``He is free-spirited, high energy and always can make
people laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   In focus groups, Green came up as a person boys and young men
liked, King said, adding that additional research suggested to the
company that the best way to reach young men was through humor and
information they deemed useful.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really don't want to hear a product story, but they want
some product information,'' King said. ``They are saying, `Tell me,
give me a reason,' but they don't want to be bored to death and
they don't want anything too intense or too scientific.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the introductory campaign, like the comic, does not
take itself too seriously. The spots show Green, who is 28,
reporting as if live from Muscle Beach, where he appears to be
unleashing a trailer full of tigers on unsuspecting weight lifters
to create extreme conditions.
</P>
<P>
   As the tigers wreak havoc, Green mugs for the camera, claiming,
for example, to prove the product's effectiveness by rubbing
Extreme Sport on the forehead of a weight lifter trying to climb
over a chain-link fence while a tiger is pursuing him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's great at shocking humor,'' said Al Merrin, executive
creative director at BBDO New York, the Right Guard agency, of
Green, who is in the midst of a well-publicized bout with cancer.
``There's a kind of sweetness about him; he gets away with the most
outrageous stuff. And the kids like it.''
</P>
<P>
   BBDO New York, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of the Omnicom
Group, was looking for a new approach for the new product and
sought to avoid demonstrations of the drama and energy of extreme
sports, which have been commonplace in campaigns for brands aimed
at younger consumers like Mountain Dew, also produced by BBDO New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, while extreme sports are popular as a backdrop for
advertising, celebrities of the sports have yet to be tapped by
corporate America, said Nova Lanktree, president of Lanktree Sports
Celebrity Network in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a lot of commercials, like car commercials, of wild
involvement between man and nature, but you don't see the face of
an extreme athlete _ they haven't emerged as stars and I don't know
why,'' Lanktree said. ``The sports are kind of wild, hip and fun _
very MTV, so I think you would get a lot of bang for your buck with
Tom Green if that's the audience you're targeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Right Guard has long been a top brand for Gillette, but its
sales, like those of the entire $1.7 billion
deodorant-antiperspirant category, are sluggish. Right Guard has a
9 percent share of the market, followed by Degree, made by
Unilever, with 8.7 percent, and Mennen Speed Stick, made by
Colgate-Palmolive, with 7.3 percent, according to Information
Resources Inc., a market research company.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette decided to go after the youth market mainly because of
its growth potential, King said, but it also recognized that boys
as young as 10 are interested in appearance and are a factor behind
the popularity of fragrances like Tommy. With that in mind, King
said, Extreme Sport is offered in light citrusy scents like Cool
Peak and Fresh Blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``In looking at the demographic trends, we saw a huge influx
coming of echo boomers,'' she added, referring to the so-called
Generation Y children of baby boomers. ``We want to make sure Right
Guard is their brand of choice.''
</P>
<P>
   But Right Guard is not alone. Speed Stick sponsors televised
coverage of the X Games and Gravity Sports. And last month, Mennen
reformulated and repositioned Speed Stick Ultimate to reach men
under 25, introducing fragrances like Glacier and Power Zone.
</P>
<P>
   Right Guard is not Green's first foray into advertising. Madison
Avenue was unusually swift in spotting Green, who only auditioned
for his MTV series in 1998. PepsiCo Inc. used Green in 1999,
shortly after his MTV show began, for a promotional campaign for
Pepsi One linked to the NCAA Championship tournament. Those
commercials, also created by BBDO New York, featured his antics in
visits to college campuses; they were well received, according to
executives at Pepsi-Cola, but Green no longer appears in ads for
the brand.
</P>
<P>
   The Right Guard Extreme Sport campaign is the first from BBDO
New York since the agency won the Right Guard brand account last
year from Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi in New York. Gillette plans to spend
$61 million in total marketing and advertising to introduce Right
Guard Extreme Sport in America.

MARINE MISCONDUCT IN OKINAWA PROMPTS A GENERAL'S APOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to correct spelling of Luke in graf 4 and to correct to
``group of 8 industrial nations'' in next to last graf.)  
 By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ With a summit meeting of the world's industrial powers
opening in Okinawa in just two weeks, the United States was taking
no chances that more demonstrations against the U.S. Marines there
would mar the event.
</P>
<P>
   So even though no charges had been filed against a 19-year-old
Marine accused of molesting a 14-year-old girl in Okinawa on
Monday, the top U.S. military official on the southern Japanese
island went to the governor's office Thursday and apologized.
</P>
<P>
   He bowed. He expressed regret. And he tried, once more, to
smooth relations with the people of Okinawa, where widespread fear
and concern exists over crimes by U.S. soldiers, who have been
accused of numerous cases of violence and sexual misconduct through
the years.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Lt. Gen. Earl B. Hailston, visited Okinawa's
governor, Keiichi Inamine, at the prefecture government's office to
make the formal apology, which included a bow of Japanese
contrition. He was accompanied by the U.S. consul-general of
Okinawa, Robert Luke. Hailston is the regional coordinator for U.S.
military forces in Okinawa, where two-thirds of the 47,000 U.S.
troops stationed in Japan are based.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to express to the family involved, as well as to the
people of Okinawa, my sincerest apology and most profound regret
for the incident and for the anxiety it has created,'' said
Hailston. Hailston's apology was not the first by a U.S. official.
In 1995, Defense Secretary William J. Perry apologized on behalf of
America and three servicemen charged with raping a 12-year-old
Japanese girl. His apology, like Hailston's, came just before a
summit meeting in Japan. The servicemen were later convicted.
</P>
<P>
   In his apology Thursday, Hailston said: ``The relationship of a
Marine leader to his subordinate Marines is like the relationship
of a father to his children; these Marines are my sons and
daughters. That is why it hurts me deeply when any of my Marines
appears to fall short of the standard I have set and demand. It
hurts me, as it hurts you, my neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Japanese and Western historians have said that in the aftermath
of World War II, U.S. troops raped thousands of Okinawan women
without reprisals. The historians said that while hundreds of rape
cases have been documented, most went unreported for fear of
retaliation and shame.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This latest incident unfolded on Monday after a woman told
police that her daughter has been molested. The authorities accused
a 19-year-old marine of breaking into the girl's home and touching
her body while she slept. The marine, who is stationed at the Air
Station Futenma in Ginowan, Okinawa, was arrested at the scene on
suspicion of trespassing and conducting an indecent act against a
minor.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the Marine was drunk during the incident and that he had told
the police he meant to visit a friend's house but entered the
girl's residence by mistake. They said the door to the home was
unlocked, as is the custom of many Okinawans. The police officials
said the Marine has denied molesting the girl. Evening newspapers
in Okinawa reported Thursday that the girl had told the police that
the Marine had touched her face and body and climbed on top of her.
</P>
<P>
   Since Monday's arrest, labor unions, peace activists, women's
rights groups and human rights organizations have rallied near U.S.
bases and sent letters of protest to the prefectural government.
Some local city mayors canceled their scheduled appearances at a
Fourth of July celebration held at the U.S. consulate in Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   The general's comments appear to have done little to quell
growing outrage in Okinawa over the incident, which could prove
extremely embarrassing to Clinton, who is scheduled to attend the
summit meeting of the Group of 8 industrial nations from July
21-23.
</P>
<P>
   Protest leaders vowed to hold follow-up demonstrations and to
use this latest incident to stir anti-base sentiment. The Peace
Action Center Okinawa, a group of union and progressive party
activists, plans to form a human chain around the Kadena Air Base
in Okinawa on July 20, the eve of the summit meeting of the world's
leading industrialized nations.

RULES , WRITTEN AND UNWRITTEN , BROKEN OR NOT BROKEN , AT THE TOUR
DE FRANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOURS, France _ A controversial _ or maybe not so _ attack by 12
riders turned the Tour de France on its head Thursday, placing nine
supposed noncontenders high atop the overall standing and provoking
angry charges of not playing by the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Blame it all on Jacky Durand, since everybody else probably
will.
</P>
<P>
   Was he the one who launched the attack when the man in the
yellow jersey, Laurent Jalabert, stopped at the side of the road to
urinate? Under the unwritten code of bicycle racing, which hardly
anyone has respected for years, riders are not supposed to speed
away in such a situation. (Nor are they free to do so when a leader
has crashed, although almost everybody does.)
</P>
<P>
   Leon Van Bon, a Dutch rider with the Rabobank team and the
winner of this sixth stage, denied that Jalabert had been betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three or four of us did attack, but when we realized that
Jalabert had stopped, we slowed down and were caught,'' Van Bon
said. ``We attacked again when he was back in the pack.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Bon was contradicted by the new man in the yellow jersey,
Alberto Elli, an Italian rider with Telekom. Poor Elli _ 13 years a
professional and the Tour's overall leader for the first time at
age 36, and the opening question he was asked in a news conference
was whether Jalabert had been in the bushes.
</P>
<P>
   Elli answered yes. He quickly added that he had not launched the
attack but had merely joined it. ``Somebody went off on the left
while Jalabert was stopped on the right,'' he said. ``Like a lot of
others, I joined the attack but I didn't start it.''
</P>
<P>
   A hard-working journeyman with some climbing talent, Elli is not
expected to hold the lead long. Nor are his companions expected to
remain in the upper reaches of the overall standing. But that is
just what was said in 1990 when a similar long breakaway left four
riders far ahead of the favorites, where some stayed for more than
two weeks of the three-week Tour.
</P>
<P>
   With Elli and eight of his 12 companions in the breakaway
ensconced atop the standing, Jalabert, a Frenchman with the ONCE
team, is now 10th, 5 minutes 40 seconds behind Elli. The other
major contenders are even further back, with Lance Armstrong, the
U.S. leader of the U.S. Postal Service team, in 12th place, 5:54
behind.
</P>
<P>
   In second place behind Elli by 12 seconds is the unsung Fabrice
Gougot, a Frenchman with Credit Agricole. Marc Waughters, a Belgian
with Rabobank, is third, 1:17 behind.
</P>
<P>
   Van Bon was clocked in 4:28.06 for the 198.5-kilometer
(123-mile) stage from the occasionally medieval town of Vitre to
the Loire Valley city of Tours in sunny and breezy weather. That
meant an average speed of 44 kilometers an hour (about 27 mph). The
main pack finished 7:49 behind, vaulting Elli from 21st place to
the lead.
</P>
<P>
   The reason Durand, a French dynamo with the Lotto team, was
suspected in the triumphant bolt at the 14th kilometer was his
habit of launching attacks anywhere at any time. This was a special
day for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allez Jacky.'' ``Allez Durand.'' ``Jacky Durand.'' ``Club
Supporters Jacky Durand.'' ``Allez Dudu.'' Durand's name and
nickname were writ large everywhere Thursday at the start in Vitre
because he is a native of the region, born and reared just outside
nearby Laval.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old Durand needs no encouragement to attack. His
trademark is the long-distance breakaway, often solo, frequently
with a companion or two.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the tactic works _ he has won two French national
championships, two World Cup classics and three stages in the Tour
_ but more often it does not. Twice already in this 87th Tour,
which began Saturday, the Frenchman has stayed ahead of the pack
for long periods and then been caught.
</P>

OLDEST SON'S REVELS EMBARRASS BLAIR
</HEADLINE>
   (No byline) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Prime Minister Tony Blair, who has made a point of
keeping his four young children out of the news, was embarrassed
Thursday by front-page headlines reporting the arrest of his
16-year-old son Euan for drunkenness Wednesday night in downtown
London.
</P>
<P>
   Days ago, Blair called for strict measures against pub rioters
and drunken soccer hooligans. The police said they had arrested
Euan because they were concerned about his state.
</P>
<P>
   The police found him on the pavement in Leicester Square at 11
p.m. after he vomited and collapsed on an outing with friends
celebrating the end of exams. He was taken to Charing Cross police
station, where he gave a false name before his identity was
discovered, and officers from the prime minister's residence, were
sent to take him home.
</P>
<P>
   Blair issued a statement saying in part: ``Euan is very sorry
for the inconvenience he caused to the police, the state he was in,
and for the false statement he made. He is in no doubt of the
seriousness of it and the view that his parents take of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday afternoon, Blair interrupted a speech to a convention
in Brighton to say: ``Well, being a prime minister can be a tough
job, but I always think being a parent is probably tougher.
Sometimes you don't always succeed, but the family to me is more
important than anything else.''

BIG RETAILERS SAY JUNE SALES WERE WEAK 
</HEADLINE>
   By KRUTI TRIVEDI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Squeezed by rising gasoline prices and discouraged by cool,
rainy weather, Americans put a brake on retail spending in June,
new figures showed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sales in stores open for more than a year, a crucial figure for
measuring the health of the retail industry, rose 2.6 percent for
the month compared with the period a year earlier, according to the
Goldman Sachs retail composite index. Except for March, when Easter
sales were delayed by a month, that is the lowest percentage
increase since September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   As anemic as the numbers were, analysts said they were in line
with expectations that the economy was losing steam.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected to see a slowdown,'' said George Strachan, a
retail analyst at Goldman Sachs. ``The weather was bad. Fashion was
bad. Basically, it was a pretty bad month.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are not increasing their spending as much at all types
of stores, ranging from specialty apparel stores like the Gap to
discount stores like Kmart and department stores like Dayton
Hudson, a unit of Target.
</P>
<P>
   Much to the dismay of the merchants, consumers have shown an
increasing distaste throughout the year for buying clothes, in
particular. ``There's no question that apparel sales have slowed as
we've moved through the year,'' said Richard N. Baum, a retail
analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. ``We've seen a steady
deceleration in same-store sales. This month they were barely
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   In what could be another sign of a consumer slowdown, Federated
Department Stores, the parent company of the Macy's and
Bloomingdale chains, said its second-quarter earnings would be hurt
by credit card defaults at Fingerhut, its catalog arm. Fingerhut
sells merchandise mostly to lower-and middle-income Americans, and
credit troubles there could foreshadow more widespread consumer
woes.
</P>
<P>
   Even discount chains like Wal-Mart, Target and Kmart, which led
the booming growth last year, all reported moderate to poor sales
in June. Wal-Mart's sales increased 4.8 percent at stores open for
more than a year, but the rise was mostly a result of food sales,
analysts said. Target's discount stores reported growth of 2.1
percent, in large part because of difficulties with its women's
apparel business, a company spokeswoman said. Overall, Target's
sales rose 1.1 percent. Kmart fared the worst, showing a 1 percent
drop in sales, also because of problems with apparel, one analyst
said.
</P>
<P>
   Department stores and specialty stores also had difficulties.
There were widespread markdowns to get rid of excess inventory, and
analysts said such price cuts could eventually reduce profits.
</P>
<P>
   In the specialty retail sector, Gap Inc., which has been
struggling to get the fashion mix in its stores right for nearly
nine months, missed again in June as sales fell 2 percent. Sales at
the company's Old Navy division dropped by at least 7 percent, but
analysts said that was because Old Navy had phenomenal growth of
more than 30 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Gap also announced Thursday that it would miss earnings
estimates by 3 cents a share for the current quarter, but its
shares rose $3.75, to $33.625, because analysts expected the news
to be worse.
</P>
<P>
   The Limited, on the other hand, reported a 6 percent increase in
same-store sales, but its stock hardly moved. It continued to
benefit from its teenager-friendly Express division, analysts said,
but investors were less confident about the Structure and Lane
Bryant divisions, both of which reported decreasing sales.
</P>
<P>
   There were a few standouts in terms of sales. Neiman Marcus, for
example, pulled in more customers by having its annual men's sale
in June instead of May and by cutting back on its more moderately
priced lines. Its sales rose 17.3 percent. And Intimate Brands,
which reported a 9 percent sales increase, was bolstered by
lingerie sales at its Victoria's Secret Stores.

SOUTH AFRICA LOSES TO GERMANY AS SITE FOR SOCCER'S 2006 WORLD CUP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for complete rewrite; note new byline.)   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a mild surprise, Germany was awarded the 2006 World Cup over
South Africa on Thursday as international soccer officials
apparently chose the certain success of the world's largest
sporting event in a European country over concerns of stability and
safety about post-apartheid South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Germany prevailed by one vote in a dramatic result that carried
much political soccer intrigue in Zurich, Switzerland, the home of
the sport's world governing body, known by its French initials as
FIFA. Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany said the victory
showed that his country was ``open to the world and hospitable'' a
half-century after Nazism and nearly three decades after the
slaying of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa called the
defeat ``a tragic day for Africa.'' Securing the World Cup was
being viewed as a way to help transform South Africa as it
continues to reshape itself from its recent past of
government-mandated racial separation by boosting national pride,
attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors and a billion
television viewers, adding several billions of dollars and more
than 100,000 jobs to the struggling economy and ameliorating the
concerns of skittish international investors. While rugby and
cricket are the national sports of white South Africans, soccer is
the sport of choice for the overwhelming black majority.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa had been host to the 1995 Rugby World Cup and the
1996 African Nations Cup soccer championships and believed it had
the necessary stadiums, infrastructure and technology to stage the
2006 World Cup. Instead, for the second time in three years, it was
denied a major international sporting event. In the fall of 1997,
Cape Town lost to Athens in its bid to be host of the 2004 Summer
Games as members of the International Olympic Committee voiced
concerns after Nelson Mandela left office as president of South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Alan I. Rothenberg, the past president of the U.S. Soccer
Federation who headed the FIFA committee that inspected the
countries bidding on the 2006 World Cup, said his group had ranked
Germany just ahead of South Africa in terms of preparedness.
Germany is an international soccer power, having won three World
Cups and three European titles, and it has Europe's strongest
economy. It also entered Thursday's voting with the firm backing of
the eight Europeans who are one-third of the 24-member FIFA
executive committee, whose main job is to award the World Cup. For
the 2002 World Cup, South Korea and Japan will be the co-hosts.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Brazil had withdrawn its candidacy and thrown its
support behind South Africa, reportedly in exchange for South
Africa's support of its bid for the 2010 World Cup. Joseph ``Sepp''
Blatter, the president of FIFA, had also thrown his public support
behind South Africa. England's chances disappeared with the
thuggish acts of hooliganism committed by its fans at the recently
completed European Championships held in Belgium and the
Netherlands. Morocco was never given a serious chance of winning
because the North African nation had a severe lack of necessary
stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say the vote was a mild surprise, not a shock,''
Rothenberg, who organized the most successful World Cup ever held,
in the United States in 1994, said by telephone from Zurich. ``We
felt for some time that it would come down to Germany or South
Africa and be very close.''
</P>
<P>
   Both countries were considered well qualified, Rothenberg said,
but increasing violence in South Africa appeared to make some
voters hesitant.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, nothing could be surer than having Germany or
any other major western European country hosting a World Cup,''
Rothenberg said. ``It's going to be enormously successful. South
Africa came down to people assessing in their heart that while they
may want it to go to South Africa, it is better to wait a while
longer. This new country is only six years old. Obviously it has
certain safety problems. We were satisfied after speaking with law
enforcement and security people that people would be safe going
there during the World Cup. We were satisfied; possibly other
people weren't.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Thursday's voting was also affected by the
ubiquitous and complicated political intrigue that attends the
awarding of all major international sporting events. Three rounds
of polling were necessary before Germany prevailed with a majority
of votes from FIFA's executive committee. In the final round,
Germany prevailed by 12-11, with an unexplained abstention from
Charles Dempsey, a delegate from New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   The South Africans claimed that Dempsey had reneged on a promise
to vote for them after England had been eliminated. His abstention
led to speculation that Blatter, FIFA's president, had orchestrated
the German victory behind the scenes even though he publicly
supported South Africa. Had Dempsey voted for South Africa, leaving
the result even at 12-12, Blatter would have been called upon to
break the tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little bit sad that the executive committee had not
the courage to innovate,'' Blatter said. ``We have to trust Africa
and we have to take this decision. We have to take the risk,
otherwise they will never have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very strange, unfortunate,'' Rothenberg said of Dempsey's
abstention. ``He claimed he was under enormous pressure. So is
everyone on the committee. It's probably the single most important
thing you do as a member of the FIFA executive committee, vote on
the host of the World Cup. You make your vote and take the
consequences. Some like it or hate it, but that's life. You do the
right thing. I don't understand.''

 GTECH'S TOP TWO EXECUTIVES RESIGN AMID CONTROVERSY 
</HEADLINE>
  By GREG WINTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Gtech Holdings Corp., the world's largest lottery company,
said Thursday that its two top executives had resigned and that its
revenues would fall short of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The Rhode Island company said the departures of William Y.
O'Connor, chairman and chief executive, and Stephen P. Nowick,
president and chief financial officer, were a result of the board's
dissatisfaction with the unexpected revenue announcement, Gtech's
lagging stock price and the poor handling of a computer
miscalculation in Britain's national lottery that recently came to
light.
</P>
<P>
   W. Bruce Turner, a former gambling analyst who joined Gtech's
board last year, will step in as nonexecutive chairman. The company
said it had begun a search to fill the other positions.
</P>
<P>
   The company said revenue for the year would miss forecasts by
$15 million to $21.5 million. Two weeks ago, Gtech announced
first-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street's expectations by 12
percent, its best performance in more than a year. In speaking to
analysts and reporters then, executives gave no indication that a
revenue shortfall was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said news of the shortfall came as a surprise to the
board ``that we just learned about within the last few days.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But forecasts are guesses, some of which are beyond your
control, some of which should not be out of your control,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Turner said a recent decision by the Rhode Island Legislature to
cut fees for video lottery operators, a move that will deprive the
company of roughly $3 million this year, could not have been
anticipated. Nor could the company have foreseen a problem like
Colombia's postponement of its national lottery, which could cost
the company as much as $15 million in lost sales for the year.
</P>
<P>
   But Gtech also disclosed cost overruns for projects in Israel
and Australia. The company said it was seeking to determine the
extent of the overruns and whether they could have been avoided.
Gtech designs and sells computer systems for state-run lotteries,
and some analysts speculate that the miscalculated costs were a
result of inaccurate bids by the company.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the board's patience with O'Connor and Nowick
might have been stretched by their handling of other problems. In
May, Gtech came under scrutiny for a 1998 computer malfunction that
resulted in a miscount of the number of winners in Britain's
national lottery. The problem was fixed within a month, but neither
Gtech's board nor the company operating the lottery, Camelot, was
informed, Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   When he became chairman of Gtech in 1998, O'Connor was widely
viewed as a moral boost to a company that had become known for
ethical lapses. A co-founder, Guy B. Snowden, had resigned after a
British jury found he had committed libel against Richard Branson,
head of the Virgin Group. In addition to allegations that Snowden
tried to bribe Branson in connection with an effort to win a
contract to operate Britain's national lottery, Gtech had been
investigated for trying to influence politicians and lottery
officials in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor fired executives and installed a former FBI official to
oversee Gtech's compliance efforts. But while the moves helped
restore confidence in the company among potential customers, they
did little to lift its stock price, which fell from a high of $40
in 1998 to no higher than $26 over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Gtech's lackluster stock performance, despite its
relatively consistent earnings, is attributable to the slowdown in
new public lottery projects in the United States. With budget
surpluses across the country, few states have turned to lotteries
to generate revenue. Gtech already holds contracts with 28 of the
38 states that have lotteries, offering few opportunities for
sustainable growth, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, most of the company's efforts are now directed
overseas, where roughly half of all lotteries are not yet
automated.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Gtech fell $2.9375, to $19.8125, Thursday. &QL;

PRICE FINDS THE OLD TOUCH AS WOODS STARTS SLOWLY 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEMONT, Ill. _ In 1994, when Tiger Woods was still a teen-ager,
Nick Price was the best golfer in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Price won six tournaments in 1994, including the British Open
and the PGA Championship. Golf seemed easy to Price then, just as
it seems easy for Woods today. When Price played, he usually
contended. When he contended, he often won.
</P>
<P>
   Much has changed for Price since his glory days. He has not won
a tournament since 1998, and at age 43, he sometimes wonders if he
will ever win again. That made Thursday's opening round of the
Advil Western Open special for Price. Tying the course record with
a 9-under 63 at Cog Hill Golf and Country Club, Price led by three
strokes over Jim Furyk (66), and by four strokes over Carl Paulson,
Steve Stricker, Stuart Appleby and Fred Couples.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Woods, playing his first tournament since winning the
U.S. Open, and his only tournament before the British Open later
this month, was at two under with an opening-round 70.
</P>
<P>
   While Woods struggled to find his putting stroke and squandered
birdie opportunities, Price was sharp. He shot a 30 on the front
nine and birdied eight of the first 11 holes. At that point, the
thought of shooting 59 crossed his mind. Instead, he settled for
the course record, which he shares with Jeff Sluman (1992), John
Adams (1993) and Dudley Hart (1998).
</P>
<P>
   Can Price play well enough for three more days to win the
tournament? He wasn't sure. But Thursday's round was a major
confidence lifter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed something like that because I've been floundering a
little bit,'' said Price, who is ranked No. 11 in the world but who
has not won since the FedEx St. Jude Classic in the summer of 1998.
``I got back on track today and had some good memories of times
gone by.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between now and the next two years, I want to give it my best
shot, because at the end of next year I'll probably start slowing
down a bit. Realistically, not many guys have played well past 45,
and I'm 44 on my next birthday. So I better make the most of this
year and next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Price capitalized on superb iron shots that left him in prime
position for birdies. Six of Price's nine birdie putts were from
inside 10 feet. He made a 17-foot putt for birdie at No. 11. At
that point, Price was 8-under with seven holes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   If Price could have played the final seven holes at 5-under, he
would have shot 59, equaling the PGA Tour scoring record held by Al
Geiberger (1977), Chip Beck (1991) and David Duval (1999). Price
made par at No. 12, then barely saved par at No. 13, getting up and
down from a bunker. Price stopped thinking about a 59, but he made
one last birdie at No. 16, hitting a 7-iron approach shot that
stopped 18 inches from the cup.
</P>
<P>
   Putting has been Price's nemesis in recent years, but he looked
solid on the greens Thursday. Price has fond memories of this
event, having won it in 1993 and in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through '93 and '94, when I was putting great, I could have
putted on peanut brittle, I would have made them,'' said Price, who
tied Woods for most tour victories during the 1990s (15). ``Golf is
like life. Sometimes things happen and you just can't explain them.
You question a lot of things when you're not playing well. It takes
you six, eight weeks to work into a slump. But it only takes one
good round to work out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods will begin Friday trying to chip away at Price's lead.
While Woods was fairly solid from tee to green, his putter acted as
if it were still on vacation. Woods missed potential birdie putts
from 10 feet at No. 10, from 12 feet at No. 13 and from 8 feet at
No. 18. Afterward he refused to blame his performance on being
rusty, or on letting down after winning the U.S. Open by 15 strokes
at Pebble Beach on June 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good, and I was ready to go from the first tee,'' said
Woods, the defending champion, who is attempting to win this event
for the third time in four years. ``Unfortunately, I just didn't
make enough putts.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods can make a seven-stroke deficit disappear quickly, and
Price is taking nothing for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always good to get off to a good start, but there's a lot
of golf left,'' Price said. ``If I get in the hunt, I'll start
thinking about winning Sunday when I get to the back nine.'' &QL;

   The police released few details about the shooting of Lane, who
had been the Carolina Panthers' leading rusher before being traded
to the Colts in April. A police spokesman, Keith Bridges, said that
Lane's wife, Deidra, was being questioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investigation to this point has revealed that Deidra Lane
shot her husband during a domestic dispute,'' the police said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Capt. Chuck Johnson of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police
Department told The Associated Press: ``At this point there's no
arrest, there's no nothing. It's just an investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Lane's father, Fred Lane Sr., said the couple had been
experiencing marital problems. Last March, Lane was named in a
domestic complaint filed by his wife. She said he had snatched a
necklace from her neck during an argument, causing her to fall.
</P>
<P>
   Lane's death comes at a time when the NFL has spent considerable
resources attempting to clean up its image and encouraging its
players to stay out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Lane was one of the most talented players in the short history
of the Carolina Panthers, having gained 2,004 yards with the team.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers suspended Lane for one game in 1998 after he made a
lewd gesture to fans during a game against the Jets at Giants
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Lane was indicted Wednesday by a grand jury in Jackson, Tenn.,
on misdemeanor drug charges related to an arrest Feb. 3. During
that incident, the police had found a loaded .22-caliber
assault-style rifle in the trunk of Lane's car after stopping him
for driving slowly on a side street. While searching Lane and three
passengers, officers found 1.3 grams of marijuana on Lane and 4
grams of marijuana on one of his passengers. Weapons charges
against Lane were eventually dropped.
</P>
<P>
   According to several NFL team executives, the Panthers had been
uncertain whether they could ever truly count on Lane, prompting
trade discussions with several teams, including the Colts.
</P>
<P>
   Some teams, those executives said, began their own background
investigations of Lane and ultimately shared the Panthers'
concerns, especially after hearing accusations that Lane had missed
at least one team flight and had been late or missed several team
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   While other teams decided not to trade for Lane, the Colts
thought they could rehabilitate his career. Lane was scheduled to
be the backup for the Pro Bowl runner Edgerrin James.
</P>
<P>
   His father said that Lane had spent the past few weeks in
Nashville, although he had visited in Charlotte briefly a week ago.
Lane flew from Tennessee to Charlotte on Thursday, just hours
before he was shot, his father said.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   These have been troubling times for the NFL and its players.
Another former Panther, Rae Carruth, the team's top 1997 draft
pick, faces a murder trial in the shooting of his pregnant wife.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in Atlanta had accused the star Baltimore Ravens
linebacker Ray Lewis of complicity in the stabbing deaths of two
men after the Super Bowl. Lewis pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor
charge of lying to police investigators during his trial last
month, and murder and assault charges against him were dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Player troubles away from the field were a major topic for NFL
owners at their winter and spring meetings. Concerned that its
image was being tarnished, the league expanded its violent crime
policy (now called the ``personal conduct policy'').
</P>
<P>
   The league now screens incoming players for potential problems
at the annual scouting combine.
</P>
<P>
   There will also be mandatory counseling for at-risk players as
well as the training of coaches by professional counselors to
identify those players.

CALIFORNIA GIVES JURORS A RAISE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Also moving in the ``n'' state news file.) 
 &HT;    By JASON KANDEL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A statewide raise in jury pay took effect this
week -- the first in more than four decades -- but does little to
adequately compensate jurors, court officials said, although it at
least recognizes their role in the justice system.
</P>
<P>
   One-day-service pay for jurors remains at $5 per day, but for
service beyond the first day, jurors will be paid $15 -- a whopping
$1.88 per hour for eight hours of service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're delighted,'' said Judge Jacqueline Connor, a Los Angeles
Superior Court judge based downtown, and co-chair of a jury task
force. ``But our goal is $40 a day, like the federal courts. This
is not the end of it. The money is not even close to being enough,
but this is an important statement of the symbolism in what they
do.''
</P>
<P>
   The pay increase, which took effect Monday, is one of several
ways in which the Judicial Council has been fighting to improve
jury service to encourage more participation.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Gomez, the Superior Court juror supervisor, was happy
when she heard the news but had hoped for a little more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't be more delighted,'' she said. ``We really wanted
$40, but one step at a time, right?''
</P>
<P>
   This pay raise is just one of many recent improvements to
encourage participation. Some courts in the San Fernando Valley and
around Los Angeles County are already using the
one-day-or-one-trial rule, which allows jurors to serve on one
trial, or be called on one day and, if not chosen, dismissed.
Another plan in the works is to create opportunities for jurors to
ask questions of lawyers and judges.
</P>
<P>
   The raise was part of the 2000-2001 budget signed by Gov. Gray
Davis. The budget also provides for new court technology, a pay
increase for court interpreters, and improvements in court-based
programs for families and children. Judges will also get an 8.5
percent salary increase.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice Ronald M. George, chairman of the Judicial
Council, praised the attempts to meet the needs of California's
courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Californians will benefit from the funding to increase the
pay of jurors, to modernize the courts, and to help the state
continue to attract and retain the finest jurists,'' he said. ``The
budget responds to many of the immediate needs of the courts and
provides support for long-term priorities set by the judicial
branch of government.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the provisions in the budget approval: certified and
registered court interpreters will get $265 a day; child and family
services will get $10 million; $506,000 was approved to establish a
three-year pilot program in which 10 civil departments in the Los
Angeles Superior Court downtown offices would be authorized to make
mandatory referrals of civil cases to mediation; $11.1 million for
half-year funding of 20 new trial court judgeships and 12 new
appellate judgeships; $56.4 million for court technology. Funding
was also provided to address negotiated salary increases for trial
court and court security personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The Judicial Council will review the budget at its Aug. 25
meeting in San Francisco, where members will disburse funding.

   THE REPUBLICANS: A Change in Vacation Plans
</P>
<P>
   While political operatives and journalists fish for information
about the status of Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma in the
Republican vice presidential sweepstakes, Keating is actually set
to go fishing in Alaska next week. And it turns out that he was
supposed to have been accompanied by the man charged with helping
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas select a running mate, former Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney. A few days ago, Keating called Cheney and
offered to stay home, lest their trip set too many tongues to
wagging. But Cheney had already decided he was too busy to go. Even
so, the initial arrangements for the trip, made before Cheney had
assumed his role in the Bush campaign, demonstrated the many
connections and long friendship between Cheney and Keating. Cheney
has other Oklahoma ties: he is chief executive of Halliburton Co.,
a Texas-based energy company that has operations in Oklahoma, and
he was the national fund-raising chairman for the memorial in
Oklahoma City for the victims of the 1995 bombing there.

<P>
   THE CONVENTIONS: Diversity on the Dais
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to emphasize diversity, the Republican National
Committee has picked three members of Congress _ a Hispanic, an
African-American and a woman _ for leadership roles at the
Republican National Convention in Philadelphia. They are Reps.
Henry Bonilla of Texas, J.C. Watts of Oklahoma and Jennifer Dunn of
Washington. Each will help preside over the convention and deliver
a speech. While the Bush campaign said Thursday that the
appointments symbolized Bush's desire for the party to become more
inclusive, the Gore campaign dismissed the appointments as being
more symbolic than substantial. Others named to leadership
positions are House Speaker Dennis Hastert, Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott and Gov. George Pataki of New York.
</P>
<P>
   THE DEMOCRATS: Collecting Cash
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee raised $60 million in the
first six months of the year, nearly half of it at a huge dinner
honoring President Clinton in May, a Democratic party official said
Thursday. The party had $30 million in the bank as of July 1, its
best cash position ever at this stage of a presidential race, the
official said. The Democrats raised $26 million in the first three
months of the year and $34 million from April to June. On May 24,
the party reaped $26.5 million at a single event _ a tribute to
Clinton orchestrated by Terry McAuliffe, the Democrats' most
prolific fund-raiser. The party has spent $12.5 million on
television advertisements pointing out differences with Republicans
on Social Security and prescription drug benefits for the elderly.
The Republicans have spent about $5 million so far on such issue
advertising.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE STATES: Primary Rules at Issue
</P>
<P>
   Citing a recent Supreme Court ruling, the head of the Democratic
Party in Washington State has threatened to go to court unless
state election rules are changed before the Sept. 19 primary to
prevent a ``blanket primary.'' Washington has long used such a
system, under which voters may choose any candidate for any party
in the primary and the top Democratic and Republican vote-getters
then face each other in a general election. But the Supreme Court
recently struck down such wide-open primaries in a ruling involving
California. Washington state's Democratic chairman, Paul Berendt,
asked the Washington secretary of state to create a new Democrat
ballot that does not ``contain the names of any candidate standing
for election as a nominee of any other political party or as an
independent.'' But Gary McIntosh, the state elections director,
said that the secretary of state lacked the authority to change the
system and that the old system would have to be used unless the
state Legislature intervened.

AMID COMMOTION, YANKS RALLY TO BEAT ORIOLES 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZ ROBBINS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The sunbaked afternoon at Yankee Stadium quickly
turned into a pitching barbecue. The left-hander Ed Yarnall, called
up from Columbus for Thursday's start, gave up five runs in the
first two innings on just 42 pitches. By the time the rookie
reliever Ben Ford stumbled out of the second inning, the Yankees
were trailing, 7-0, to the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. When the second inning finally ended, one hour 11
minutes after the first pitch of the game, the Yankees led, 8-7,
feasting on the four straight walks from the Orioles' starter,
Sidney Ponson, and getting a lift once again from Bernie Williams,
who extended his hitting streak to 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees then scored five more runs in the fourth inning and
rode out a 13-9 victory over the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Yankees storm into Shea Stadium for Friday night's
series opener against the Mets, having won four of five games,
Thursday's game showed that not even a fuel-injected offense can
hide the noise of a flat tire rumbling in their rotation.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees devised two temporary plans to fix it. Before the
game, manager Joe Torre announced that he was placing a fragile and
struggling David Cone in the bullpen for safekeeping for the
four-game Mets series, moving up the Yankees' best pitcher, Andy
Pettitte, into what would have been Cone's start Sunday night at
Shea.
</P>
<P>
   And after the game, Torre dropped the bombshell that the Yankees
were calling up the 35-year-old Dwight Gooden from the rookie
league minors to pitch the first game of Saturday's doubleheader
against the Mets, marking the first time that Gooden will pitch
against the team on which he became famous.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's ever going to be an adrenaline flow, I don't think
there's going to be a problem getting up for the game,'' Torre said
of Gooden's return to Shea Stadium for the first time since 1994.
``It's familiar grounds to him, and hopefully it works on our
behalf.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in talking about Gooden, Torre did not sound particularly
enthusiastic or comfortable. Gooden pitched for Torre and the
Yankees in 1996 and 1997, and after the Yankees then let him go,
Gooden took a swipe at the way Torre had used him. Now Gooden is
back, after a quick stint in the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doc was recommended to us from down below and you have to go
on their recommendations, and we need a starter for Saturday after
last night and today,'' Torre said. The Yankees beat the Orioles,
12-6, Wednesday after building a 10-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The struggling Ford was no longer considered a viable option for
a start Saturday. Nor was Jason Grimsley, who pitched in relief
Wednesday and Thursday, giving up two runs in each outing. The
rookie Jake Westbrook, who had two horrendous outings last month,
was unavailable because of a strained rib cage.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were out of alternatives, General Manager Brian
Cashman said. So they turned to Gooden, who has not pitched a major
league game in more than two months. He started the year with
Houston and was later picked up by Tampa Bay. Overall, he has a 2-3
record this season, with a 6.86 earned run average.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden has thrown 12 strikeouts in two outings with the Yankees'
Gulf Coast League team in Florida since being acquired last month.
He has been tinkering with a new pitch, a cutter, to good results.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best choice,'' Cashman said. For now. ``I'm just
hoping for a good start.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Torre, who described himself as ``a guy who isn't as
comfortable as he wants to be with our pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Yarnall showed his inexperience and nervousness within
the first minute, giving up a leadoff home run to Brady Anderson.
It was an omen for a long afternoon. ``I was struggling to get
ahead of guys,'' he said. ``I was worried too much about my stuff,
and when you do that, it unravels.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite trailing, 7-0, after an inning and a half, the
Yankees did not unravel.
</P>
<P>
   The big inning began inauspiciously, with Williams getting an
infield single on a ball that second baseman Mark Lewis didn't
field cleanly. Ponson then proceeded to crumble in startling
fashion, walking David Justice, Tino Martinez, Jorge Posada and
Scott Brosius in succession to force in two runs and leave the
bases loaded. A groundout by Jose Vizcaino scored one more run, and
a single by Chuck Knoblauch scored another to make the score 7-4.
</P>
<P>
   Orioles Manager Mike Hargrove then called for the right-hander
Jason Johnson, who is now 0-8 on the year, and he did nothing to
disprove his statistics. He promptly gave up a three-run homer to
Derek Jeter, the first batter he faced, that tied the score at 7-7.
Then Paul O'Neill swung at the next pitch and deposited it in the
seats for an 8-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, that lead did not appear safe. Mike Stanton
started the third and threw six pitches before managing to get a
strike across the plate. The crowd of 44,104 cheered when Stanton
got Luis Matos looking for the game's first strikeout, 74 minutes
after the first pitch. When Stanton left, three and two-thirds
innings later, he had allowed no runs on one hit. ``I knew I had to
come in and stop the bleeding,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees piled on more runs in the fourth, and they would
need them. Williams hit his 19th home run, a two-run,
opposite-field shot to left that put the Yankees up, 12-7. Even
Justice, who had had just two hits at the plate in six games since
becoming a Yankee, contributed, logging his first home run as a
Yankee and his 22nd of the season.

SHAMROCK TO INVEST IN OPENMOBILE

<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ Shamrock Holdings of California Inc., the
investment company of the Roy E. Disney family, is teaming up with
a German venture capital firm to invest $11 million in OpenMobile
Corp., a company official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford A. Miller, a managing partner with Burbank-based
Shamrock Holdings, said the decision to join forces with Wellington
Partners was part of the company's overall investment strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are focused on a number of investment objectives in Europe
and Israel,'' Miller said. ``The executives running this company
(OpenMobile) are very experienced. It gave us a strong comfort
level to go into business with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller declined to disclose the company's share of the
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Shamrock Holdings was founded in 1978 by Roy Disney, son of Roy
E. Disney and nephew of Walt Disney, and Stanley Gold, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are focused on backing real technologies alongside quality
management teams and investment partners,'' added Gold, Shamrock's
president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concept is to leverage Shamrock's global expertise and
relationships to improve our portfolio companies' opportunities for
success,'' Gold said.
</P>
<P>
   OpenMobile, a Scandinavian-based company, is in the process of
building a global platform for mobile services for wireless
operators and content developers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its presence in Europe, OpenMobile, a newly
registered U.S. company, plans to begin operations in the United
States and Asia later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The chief operating officer of OpenMobile is Pekka Palin,
co-founder and former CEO of Wapit Ltd., Europe's leading developer
of mobile services.
</P>
<P>
   ``OpenMobile's management has a proven track record in the
wireless space,'' said Robert Moskowitz, who represents Shamrock on
the OpenMobile board, in a statement. ``In a world of great ideas
and technologies, the ability to implement and deliver remains the
key competitive advantage.''

CLINTON BEGINS UPSTATE TOUR IN FAMILIAR SPOT, FOCUSING ON ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton returned Thursday to
an electronics plant that was the scene of an event during her
early days as a prospective Senate candidate last year. She talked
Thursday about reviving the economy in upstate New York and chose
this spot to begin a five-day tour throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton began her upstate campaign swing, her Republican
opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, was on the final legs of his trip. In a
meeting with about 100 workers at a Lockheed Martin electronics
plant and in speaking with reporters, she was quick to point out
the differences in her campaign tactics from those of Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got moderate talk on the trail and extreme rhetoric in
his mail,'' Clinton said. ``I just think it's hard to tell what he
means and where he is from day to day. I'm not going to respond to
his personal insults. I'm going to run a campaign on issues, not
insults.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Clinton reacted to a fund-raising letter sent to
voters this week by Lazio's campaign in which he attacked Clinton
and President Clinton for having ``embarrassed our country and
disgraced their powerful posts.'' Clinton, the letter states,
``covets power and control and thinks she should be dictating how
other people run their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has said he had not reviewed the fund-raising letter
before it was sent.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, speaking to reporters, said, ``It's hard for me to get
this straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week he was telling New Yorkers that he wasn't
responsible for his voting record,'' she said. ``And this week he's
telling us that he's not responsible for his fund-raising letters.
I think he ought to rename his bus. Instead of the Mainstream
Express, he ought to call it the Double-Talk Express.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a news briefing outside a senior housing apartment
building in Syracuse Thursday, Lazio said he still had not seen the
letter and he continued to decline to specify what the president
and Clinton had done to embarrass the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can make a big distinction between a solicitation
letter for funds among your supporters and communicating with
commercials,'' Lazio said, referring to television advertisements
by Clinton's campaign that he has characterized as attack ads.
</P>
<P>
   At the plant, where electronic controls are made, Clinton met
with managers, took a tour and experienced simulated flying in a
military aircraft. Meeting with employees, she answered questions
on topics like transportation in the Southern Tier region of the
state and federal spending on research and development.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also attended a cookout with about 1,500 people in
Endicott, N.Y., sponsored by the Democratic Party organizations in
Broome, Tioga, Thompkins and Courtland counties. Her trip
throughout the region comes a year after she unofficially entered
the race for the U.S. Senate when she visited the farm of Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, whom she hopes to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   On this trip, however, Clinton is a full-fledged candidate and
her tour across the state's western half is focused on economic
issues. She has produced a pamphlet that is being distributed to
voters discussing various ideas, including tax credits for
investments in new technology and making high-speed Internet access
more widely available.

NEW AMGEN FACILITY OK'D
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON Z. COHEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. _ The Food and Drug Administration gave
its approval Thursday to Amgen's manufacturing facility in
Longmont, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The 200,000-square-foot factory is approved to make Epogen,
Amgen's largest-selling drug, and Amgen officials said they intend
to seek the agency's approval to make NESP, Epogen's longer-dose
cousin, at the site as well.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen spokesman David Kaye said the company plans to transfer
its manufacture of Epogen to Longmont from its Thousand Oaks
headquarters, where the drug is now made.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen's Thousand Oaks manufacturing center also makes the same
substance for sale by Johnson &AMP; Johnson, which markets it as the
drug Procrit to cancer patients in the United States and worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of both products continue to grow, Kaye said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Thousand Oaks manufacturing operation will take
on the added duties of making some of the three drugs it hopes to
have approved for sale in coming months, Kaye said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Building 6, where Epogen is now manufactured, is operating at
something like 15 times its original capacity. We have immediate
and future needs for additional manufacturing capacity,'' Kaye
said. ``We can triple the output that we currently have.''
</P>
<P>
   Stock analyst Douglas Christopher of Crowell Weedon &AMP; Co. said
the new factory will help Amgen achieve sales growth.
</P>
<P>
   Epogen brought in $1.76 billion in sales in 1999, and the
company predicts double-digit percentage growth this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say they'll come very close to -- if not surpass -- $2
billion (in Epogen sales) this year,'' Christopher said.
</P>
<P>
   And once the FDA approves the sale of NESP, the company's
fortunes could rise further, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for NESP to open up the world to them, where
they're currently restricted from competing with J and J,''
Christopher said.
</P>
<P>
   While some employees might voluntarily transfer from Thousand
Oaks to Longmont, the new factory is not a threat to local jobs.
The manufacturing activity will be transferred to other drugs as
they receive approval, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new manufacturing plant solidifies Amgen's future, said
Dennis Harp, analyst for Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason to expand into that facility was primarily to
provide commercial manufacturing for NESP,'' Harp said. ``It will
provide a commercial manufacturing facility for the long term.''

SHOPLIFTERS BEWARE; NEW LAW MAKES REMOVING THEFT DETECTORS A
FELONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY RIZZO  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ If you can't beat
them, beat them some more.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kansas legislators seem to have taken that approach with a new
law intended to safeguard the electronic devices that stores attach
to merchandise to deter shoplifters.
</P>
<P>
   A 30-year-old Olathe, Kan., woman on Thursday became the first
person in Johnson County to be charged under the law, according to
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The law took effect July 1, making illicit removal of the theft
detection devices a felony. The law also makes it illegal to
possess a tool specifically designed to remove the theft detectors,
or to possess, make or sell bags coated with materials that prevent
the sensors from working.
</P>
<P>
   The devices trigger an alarm when someone tries to leave a store
without paying for merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Danielle Renee Adams was charged in Johnson County District
Court and appeared in court Thursday afternoon. She was released
from custody after posting a $1,000 personal recognizance bond and
was ordered to return to court July 13.
</P>
<P>
   Adams was arrested Wednesday after allegedly removing the
electronic detection devices from about $240 worth of clothing and
taking the merchandise from the Jones Store at Metcalf South
Shopping Center in Overland Park.
</P>
<P>
   The theft charge is a misdemeanor because it involves less than
$500 worth of property, but Adams is charged with a felony for
allegedly removing the theft-detection devices from the clothing. (

NON-ENGLISH-SPEAKING IMMIGRANTS ARE LARGER PART OF MIDWEST WORK
FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ When the McDonald's
patron in suburban Johnson County, Kan., ordered a coffee and got a
Coke, he came face to face with a Midwest labor pool truth.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Non-English-speaking immigrants are an increasingly large part
of the labor force _ not just in the Sun Belt states but in the
upper Midwest as well.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-food worker, who spoke Spanish and had trouble
understanding the man's order, was one of tens of thousands of
Hispanics who entered the Midwest job market in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Without them, economists say, the long-running labor shortage,
particularly in entry-level jobs, would be even more severe than it
is.
</P>
<P>
   For some business patrons, the immigrant influx means occasional
difficulties in communication. For some business owners, immigrant
labor _ both documented and undocumented _ is the only way to fill
jobs that otherwise would go begging.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent measure of unemployment in the Kansas City area,
taken in May, was 2.8 percent. Missouri's jobless rate was 2.6
percent; Kansas' rate was 3.2 percent. Unemployment throughout the
Midwest is well below 5.5 percent, which is considered full
employment.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Barrera, president of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce
of Greater Kansas City, said the chamber had charted an explosive
growth in the metropolitan area's Hispanic, blue-collar,
minimum-wage work force, especially in Olathe and northeast Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Barrera said, the 1990s brought a large increase in the
number of entrepreneurial Hispanic immigrants, seen particularly in
the blossoming of small stores and restaurants in Kansas City,
Kan., and northeast Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The Hispanic chamber has no estimate of the size of the area's
Hispanic work force, but Barrera said the Hispanic population may
have grown to as many as 100,000, up from 58,000 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Midwest, Hispanic immigrants are finding work.
</P>
<P>
   Census data, updated in 1998, found that 220,000 workers in the
West North Central states were of Hispanic origin, up from 93,000
10 years earlier. The Census Bureau defines the West North Central
region as Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota, North
Dakota and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Similar findings were reported last week by the Bureau of
National Affairs Inc. in its ``Daily Labor Report 2000: Regional
Outlook on Labor Markets.''
</P>
<P>
   The bureau said Illinois now had the nation's fifth-largest
Hispanic population, the highest ranking among states not in the
Sun Belt. In Illinois and the other Midwest states, the bureau
said, Hispanic immigrants are working in construction, restaurants,
small manufacturing and farming.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of National Affairs defines the Midwest as Kansas,
Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota,
Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota. More than any other
region of the country, these states are ``literally running out of
workers,'' the bureau report said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to creating fertile employment ground for Hispanic
immigrants, the Midwest's tight labor market opens doors for other
workers.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau report said young teens are joining the work force
earlier, at-home spouses are re-entering the job market, and older
workers are postponing or coming out of retirement. Also, people
moving off welfare have entered the job market in the last three
years. ( 30 )

WOMAN WHO TOOK HER TEEN DAUGHTER TO STATION CASINO IS CHARGED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A woman who took her
16-year-old daughter to Station Casino Kansas City last month has
been charged by Clay County authorities with the misdemeanor crime
of permitting a minor to make a wager.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The mother, Carla Jean Wilson, 41, of Ash Grove, Mo., near
Springfield, is well known at area casinos as a high roller. She
was charged with a class B misdemeanor that carries a penalty of up
to six months in the county jail and a fine of up to $500.
</P>
<P>
   Station is expected to be hit with a huge fine later this month
by the Missouri Gaming Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Casino regulators also said Thursday that they are investigating
at least one other area riverboat that is suspected of entertaining
the mother and daughter recently.
</P>
<P>
   Several Station employees who had contact with the girl have
been fired or disciplined, but casino executives would not disclose
how many employees were affected.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson did not return calls Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Her trial date has not been set.
</P>
<P>
   According to case documents, Wilson aided her daughter in
placing a wager in a blackjack game at Station on June 10.
</P>
<P>
   According to several sources with knowledge of the case, it
wasn't the only bet the girl placed that weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager, who is said to appear much older than 16,
presented false identification to casino employees during the
evening of June 9. Until Sunday morning, that fake ID fooled pit
bosses, bartenders, card dealers and others.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's age finally was challenged by a casino employee
Sunday morning, when the Gaming Commission was notified and an
investigation was opened.
</P>
<P>
   Based on previous incidents, Station officials can expect a huge
fine, or worse. Station's St. Charles, Mo., casino paid a $250,000
fine in 1997 after a woman and her 12-year-old daughter were caught
playing slot machines.
</P>
<P>
   Becky Meyer was fired by Station Casino Kansas City after it was
determined she issued the girl a player's card that allowed her to
enter the casino.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer said Thursday that she hasn't found another job yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked working at the boat,'' she said. ``But I don't know if
want to go back into a situation like that again where these kids
can cost me my job again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so unfair to the (fired) employees,'' said Meyer, who
insisted she did everything she could to verify the young woman's
identification.
</P>
<P>
   John V. Finamore, Station's Midwest president, disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``These employees were terminated for not doing their job,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He would not discuss details.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is the exception and not the rule,'' Finamore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minors who present false or altered identification to enter
the casino happens here every day. We card thousands of people on
Friday and Saturday night. I'm proud that we catch most of the
offenders before they even get on the boat.'' ( 30 )
